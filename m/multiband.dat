25|$|<b>Multiband</b> {{compressors}} {{are primarily}} an audio mastering tool, but their inclusion in digital audio workstation plug-in sets is increasing their use among mix engineers. On-air signal chains of radio stations commonly use hardware <b>multiband</b> compressors to increase apparent loudness {{without fear of}} overmodulation. Having a louder sound is often considered an advantage in commercial competition. However, adjusting a radio station's <b>multiband</b> output compressor requires some artistic sense of style, plenty of time, and good ears. This is because the constantly changing spectral balance between audio bands may have an equalizing effect on the output, by dynamically modifying the on-air frequency response. A further development {{of this approach is}} programmable radio output processing, where the parameters of the <b>multiband</b> compressor automatically change between different settings according to the current programme block style or the time of day.|$|E

25|$|Compression is used {{extensively}} in broadcasting {{to boost the}} perceived volume of sound while reducing the dynamic range of source audio (typically CDs) to a range that can be accommodated by the narrower-range broadcast signal.

25|$|<b>Multiband</b> {{compressors}} work {{by first}} splitting the signal through some number of band-pass filters or crossover filters.

The chip can dynamically switch between the two clusters of cores based on CPU usage; the chip switches to the A15 cores when more processing power is needed, and stays on the A7 cores to conserve energy on lighter loads. Only one of the clusters is used at any particular moment, and software sees the processor as a single quad-core CPU. The SoC also contains an IT tri-core PowerVR SGX 544 graphics processing unit (GPU).

40|$|Abstract—A novel compact tree-design antenna (NCTA) {{with the}} ability of {{reconfigurable}} ultra-wideband (UWB) of 3. 1 GHz to 10. 6 GHz to five multi-narrowband applications is proposed. This antenna has a novel radiating element design that consists of seven small circles (7 -filter) surrounding a central circle. Moreover, the NCTA incorporates the 7 -filter that functioned as filter into the antenna design. The compact 38 mm × 38 mm antenna integrates three PIN diode switches, which are connected to a single National Instrument Data Acquisition (NI-DAQ) Board. The DAQ itself is controlled (ON/OFF state) by a virtual instrument known as “Lab VIEW Interface Software”. The activation of specific PIN diode switches in the configuration that {{is controlled by the}} DAQ then, in turn, determines the frequency agility.

In subspecies sonoriensis, for example, hemoglobin partitionings range from 0. 03 to 0. 38. The inheritance of partitioning values is under remarkably strict genetic control. The genetic variation is additive and the narrow heritability is close to 1. 0. The inheritance data can be modeled in precise detail by postulating multiple-allele polymorphisms at globin regulatory loci. Comparison of simulated versus actual inheritance data demonstrates that the so-called null structural alleles actually produce functional globins. —The genetic controls in Peromyscus may be analogous to those in primates. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms effecting the regulation are unknown.

A conjoint analysis was conducted to assert the policy preferences of Taiwan's mobileoperators, including second generation(2 G), third generation(3 G), andwireless broadband access(WBA) operators.

40|$|Purpose: Spatio-temporal {{encoding}} (SPEN) experiments {{can deliver}} single-scan MR images without folding complications and with robustness to chemical shift and susceptibility artifacts. It is here shown that further resolution improvements can arise {{by relying on}} multiple receivers, to interpolate the sampled data along the low-bandwidth dimension. The ensuing multiple-sensor interpolation is akin to recently introduced SPEN interleaving procedures, albeit without requiring multiple shots. Methods: By casting SPEN's spatial rasterization in k-space, it becomes evident that local k-data interpolations enabled by multiple receivers are akin to real-space interleaving of SPEN images. The practical implementation of such resolution-enhancing procedure becomes similar to those normally used in SMASH or SENSE, yet relaxing these methods' fold-over constraints. Results: Experiments validating the theoretical expectations were carried out on phantoms and human volunteers on a 3 T scanner. The experiments showed the expected resolution enhancement, at no cost in the sequence's complexity. With the addition of <b>multibanding</b> and stimulated echo procedures, 48 -slices full-brain coverage could be recorded free from distortions at sub-mm resolution, in 3 sec. Conclusion: Super-resolved SPEN with SENSE (SUSPENSE) achieves the goals of multi-shot SPEN interleaving within one single scan, delivering single-shot sub-mm in-plane resolutions in scanners equipped with suitable multiple sensors.

We observed a secondary eclipse of WASP- 46 b simultaneously in the g'r'i'z'JHK bands using the GROND instrument on the MPG/ESO 2. 2 m telescope. Eclipse depths of the acquired light curves were derived to infer the brightness temperatures at <b>multibands</b> that cover the SED peak. We report the first detection of the thermal emission from the dayside of WASP- 46 b in the K band at 4. 2 -sigma level and tentative detections in the H (2. 5 -sigma) and J (2. 3 -sigma) bands, with flux ratios of 0. 253 + 0. 063 /- 0. 060 %, 0. 194 +/- 0. 078 %, and 0. 129 +/- 0. 055 %, respectively. The derived brightness temperatures (2306 + 177 /- 187 K, 2462 + 245 /- 302 K, and 2453 + 198 /- 258 K, respectively) are consistent with an isothermal temperature profile of 2386 K, which is {{significantly higher than the}} dayside-averaged equilibrium temperature, indicative of very poor heat redistribution efficiency.

Both to maximize the discriminatory power and to facilitate the computer-assisted analysis, bacterial DNA was digested with four different restriction enzymes. After ligation of adaptors to the DNA fragments, PCR testing of various single primers was performed. Two single primers that gave optimal results with regard to band resolution and discriminatory power were selected and combined. The computer-assisted analysis of fingerprint patterns was performed with Pearson's product-moment correlation values of densitometric curves, without assigning bands to peaks. Thus, the analysis {{is not subject to}} human interpretation errors. With this method, we investigated two outbreaks of multiresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in an intensive care unit and various sporadic isolates of K. pneumoniae and Klebsiella oxytoca. Cluster analysis of isolates analyzed in different experiments and on different gels showed that fingerprint patterns clustered correctly according to subspecies or to the outbreaks. Multienzyme multiplex PCR AFLP revealed that the first outbreak was caused by two different types of strains. Outbreak two was caused by yet another strain of K. pneumoniae. In conclusion, the typing method used here is easy to perform and highly reproducible, and due to generation of complex banding patterns, it has a higher discriminatory power. Furthermore, the multienzyme multiplex PCR fingerprints are easy to analyze, and a reliable database can be stored in the computer to facilitate comparison of future isolates of Klebsiella spp. The method can be performed in every clinical microbiology laboratory...|$|R
