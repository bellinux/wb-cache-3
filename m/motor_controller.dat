25|$|Diodes are {{frequently}} used to conduct damaging high voltages away from sensitive electronic devices. They are usually reverse-biased (non-conducting) under normal circumstances. When the voltage {{rises above the}} normal range, the diodes become forward-biased (conducting). For example, diodes are used in (stepper motor and H-bridge) <b>motor</b> <b>controller</b> and relay circuits to de-energize coils rapidly without the damaging voltage spikes that would otherwise occur. (A diode used in such an application is called a flyback diode). Many integrated circuits also incorporate diodes on the connection pins to prevent external voltages from damaging their sensitive transistors. Specialized diodes are used to protect from over-voltages at higher power (see Diode types above).|$|E
25|$|The {{battery is}} {{guaranteed}} {{for eight years}} or 125,000 miles (200,000km in metric countries) for the base model with the 60kWh battery pack. The 85kWh battery pack is guaranteed for eight years and unlimited miles. A poll among drivers indicate that accumulated battery loss steadies around 5% after 30,000 miles (50,000km), decreasing further about 1% per additional 30,000 miles. Unlike Nissan, Tesla does not specify a limit for battery loss, but some early battery packs have been replaced. A separate battery replacement guarantee takes effect after the eighth year for the 60kWh and 85kWh batteries. Lithium-ion batteries operate best at certain temperatures. The Model S <b>motor,</b> <b>controller</b> and battery temperatures are controlled by a liquid cooling/heating circuit. Waste heat from the motor heats the battery in cold conditions, and battery performance is reduced until a suitable battery temperature is reached.|$|E

40|$|Most robot arms use {{a central}} control box that {{contains}} the power electronics, the <b>motor</b> <b>controllers</b> and the coordinating computer. This paper presents a distributed control network that allows the power electronics and <b>motor</b> <b>controllers</b> to be placed adjacent to the <b>motors.</b> Each <b>controller</b> uses a DSP for all motor control, with the individual controllers communicating {{with each other and}} a host computer using a Controller Area Network (CAN). The design eliminates the bulky multi-core cable that is a major source of downtime for robots such as the PUMA 560, while improving controller bandwidth and facilitating greater software control of motor response. ...|$|R
25|$|A further {{advantage}} of PHEVs {{is that they}} have potential to be even more efficient than conventional hybrids because a more limited use of the PHEV's internal combustion engine may allow the engine to be used at closer to its maximum efficiency. While a Prius is likely to convert fuel to motive energy on average at about 30% efficiency (well below the engine's 38% peak efficiency) the engine of a PHEV-70 would be likely to operate far more often near its peak efficiency because the batteries can serve the modest power needs at times when the combustion engine would be forced to run well below its peak efficiency. The actual efficiency achieved depends on losses from electricity generation, inversion, battery charging/discharging, the <b>motor</b> <b>controller</b> and motor itself, the way a vehicle is used (its duty cycle), and the opportunities to recharge by connecting to the electrical grid.|$|E

2500|$|The Pioneer III cars {{suffered}} from a low capacity main transformer as well as gearbox issues and a complex propulsion system that coupled highly sensitive mercury arc ignitron rectifier tubes with an inefficient DC resistance <b>motor</b> <b>controller.</b> [...] Always distinguishable by their older style diamond pantograph, the Pioneer III cars were rechristened the Silverliner Is when the second official order of Silverliners were delivered from Saint Louis Car Company in 1967, the SL-Is would also be renumbered 244 to 248 when the Silverliner IV fleet was delivered in 1974-1975. [...] The 6th car, {{which would have been}} #249, had already been written off in an accident by that time. [...] While the other Silverliner models all came with similar GE propulsion gear, they could not MU with the earlier Silverliner I cars, which soon became the odd ducks in the SEPTA Regional Rail fleet. In the late 1980s SEPTA purchased a number of push-pull trainsets to provide enough peak period capacity to retire its remaining Reading Blueliners and the Silverliner Is by the timetable that took effect April 1, 1990. [...] Until 2000, the cars were kept in storage near Wayne Junction. Although there were plans to convert the cars into locomotive-hauled coaches, SEPTA finally decided to dispose of the fleet due to the expense it would have taken to deal with PCBs in the transformers and the lack of ADA compliance. Of the 5 surviving cars, three were sent to the AAR/FRA test site in Pueblo, Colorado for use in crash tests, while the remaining 2 Pioneer III/Silverliner I cars, 246 and 247, were donated to the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania in Strasburg.|$|E

2500|$|Westinghouse {{developed}} the XD-323 rotary accelerator for motor control with 99 points; it {{was installed in}} the first PRCo car, #100, and minor modifications allowed use in the last PCCs produced in North America for San Francisco in 1952. [...] Prior streetcar control, existing from the 1890s, required a standing operator at a three foot high vertical [...] "switch stand" [...] to rotate a handle to one of six brass points mounted within the stand to provide traction motor control and acceleration. The PCC had its accelerator under the floor where the pedal activated linkage to resistance ribbons were mounted to each PCC point around the outside edge of the accelerator. [...] An arm rotating in the center had rollers on either end which cut out resistance alternately as it rotated approximately 180 degrees. [...] This same accelerator was also used for dynamic braking; when the power pedal was released the accelerator sought optimum braking for the speed, which prevented a lag when the brake pedal was depressed. [...] General Electric Developed a control system for PCC cars that mirrored the Westinghouse scheme in function, although not in simplicity or maintainability. [...] With the GE commutator <b>motor</b> <b>controller</b> operating by air pressure, {{it had to be}} redesigned {{with the advent of the}} All-Electric PCC. [...] Acceleration was variable between 1.5- and 4.75-mph per second depending upon the depression of the power pedal with the accelerator advanced automatically by a low-voltage pilot motor. [...] Service braking was also variable and the maximum dynamic application decreased speed by 4.75-mph/s; pressing the brake pedal into emergency also brought the friction and magnetic brakes into play providing a maximum deceleration of 9.0-mph/s. [...] Compared to a maximum of 14 points on old time equipment, the PCC was considerably smoother.|$|E
