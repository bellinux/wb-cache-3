40|$|Análise do comportamento do dual citroproteico do líquido cefalorraqueano em 287 pacientes com mielopatias relacionadas a processos etiológicos diversos. Os dados são distribuídos em função do diagnóstico e do tempo de doença à ocasião do exame. Considerando os mecanismos fisiopatológicos envolvidos em cada grupo e no decurso da doença, são feitas avaliações sobre os aspectos imunopatológicos envolvidos. Data on {{cerebrospinal}} fluid (CSF) cells and proteins (total proteins and gamma globulins content) are reviewed in 287 patients with mielopathies. Clinical data on these patients were reported. 6. Results obtained are distributed according to diagnoses and to time of disease (tables 1 and 2). Informations obtained through the study show that signalization of CSF system {{is related to}} the episode responsible by the disease, when the episode is singular. Repeated episodes or a progressive evolution are more apt to produce a maintained signalization of CSF cyto-protein dual. In this way data on infectious <b>myelopathies,</b> multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica are compared to those found in post-vaccination, post-infection and post-intoxication <b>myelopathies,</b> as well as to those found in B- 12 deficiency and <b>myelopathies</b> of vascular origin. Primary myelites are evaluated in report to this comparison. It is shown that changes in the CSF cyto-protein dual are more related to those found in multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica when chronic primary myelitis is considered. In acute and sub-acute primary myelites they are related to those found in post-vaccination, post-infection and post-intoxication <b>myelopathies...</b>|$|R
25|$|Central {{nervous system}} {{reactions}} to methotrexate have been reported, especially when given via the intrathecal route (directly into the cerebrospinal fluid), which include <b>myelopathies</b> and leucoencephalopathies. It has {{a variety of}} cutaneous side effects, particularly when administered in high doses.|$|R
25|$|In brain MRI, {{there is}} often an {{increased}} T2 signalling at the posterior columns of the spinal cord in patients with <b>myelopathy</b> caused by copper deficiency. T2 signalling is often an indicator {{of some kind of}} neurodegeneration. There are some changes in the spinal cord MRI involving the thoracic cord, the cervical cord or sometimes both. Copper deficiency <b>myelopathy</b> is often compared to subacute combined degeneration (SCD). Subacute combined degeneration is also a degeneration of the spinal cord, but instead vitamin B12 deficiency is the cause of the spinal degeneration. SCD also has the same high T2 signalling intensities in the posterior column as copper deficient patient in MRI imaging.|$|E
25|$|Sufferers {{typically}} present difficulty walking (gait difficulty) {{caused by}} sensory ataxia (irregular muscle coordination) due to dorsal column dysfunction or degeneration of {{the spinal cord}} (<b>myelopathy).</b> Patients with ataxic gait have problems balancing and display an unstable wide walk.

This operation is indicated when canal stenosis {{is caused by}} posterior protrusions of the anterior wall of the spinal canal (due to osteophytes, posttraumatic deformities, or tumoral lesions) involving three or more cervical segments. The procedure's principal phases are (1) removal up to the posterior longitudinal ligament of the central portion of three or more vertebral bodies, and (2) insertion into the prepared trench (15 -mm wide) of an autologous graft, previously obtained from the iliac wing. Thirty-nine cases are presented (29 spondylosic <b>myelopathies,</b> 10 posttraumatic <b>myelopathies),</b> with follow-up periods varying from 6 months to 13 years.

25|$|Neurological: Peripheral {{neuropathy}} and {{mononeuritis multiplex}} may occur. The most common problem is {{carpal tunnel syndrome}} caused by compression of the median nerve by swelling around the wrist. Rheumatoid disease of the spine can lead to <b>myelopathy.</b> Atlanto-axial subluxation can occur, owing to erosion of the odontoid process and/or transverse ligaments in the cervical spine's connection to the skull. Such an erosion (>3mm) can give rise to vertebrae slipping over one another and compressing the spinal cord. Clumsiness is initially experienced, but without due care, this can progress to quadriplegia or even death.|$|E
25|$|Potentially painful cancer {{treatments}} include immunotherapy which may produce joint or muscle pain; radiotherapy, {{which can cause}} skin reactions, enteritis, fibrosis, <b>myelopathy,</b> bone necrosis, neuropathy or plexopathy; chemotherapy, often associated with mucositis, joint pain, muscle pain, peripheral neuropathy and abdominal pain due to diarrhea or constipation; hormone therapy, which sometimes causes pain flares; targeted therapies, such as trastuzumab and rituximab, which can cause muscle, joint or chest pain; angiogenesis inhibitors like bevacizumab, known to sometimes cause bone pain; and surgery, which may produce post-operative pain, post-amputation pain or pelvic floor myalgia.|$|E
25|$|An {{assortment}} of neurological {{effects can be}} observed in 75-90% of individuals of any age with clinically observable B12 deficiency. Cobalamin deficiency manifestations are apparent in the abnormalities of the spinal cord, peripheral nerves, optic nerves, and cerebrum. These abnormalities involve a progressive degeneration of myelin, and may be expressed behaviourally through reports of sensory disturbances in the extremities, or motor disturbances, such as gait ataxia. Combined <b>myelopathy</b> and neuropathy are prevalent within a large percentage of cases. Cognitive changes may range from loss of concentration to memory loss, disorientation, and dementia. All of these symptoms may present with or without additional mood changes. Mental symptoms are extremely variable, and include mild disorders of mood, mental slowness, and memory defect. Memory defect encompasses symptoms of confusion, severe agitation and depression, delusions and paranoid behaviour, visual and auditory hallucinations, urinary and fecal incontinence in the absence of overt spinal lesions, dysphasia, violent maniacal behaviour, and epilepsy. It has been suggested that mental symptoms could be related to a decrease in cerebral metabolism, as caused by the state of deficiency. All of these symptoms may present with or without additional mood changes.|$|E
40|$|Post-traumatic {{intramedullary}} <b>myelopathies</b> and cavitations {{are well}} described lesions following {{spinal cord injury}} (SCI) in humans and have been described in histopathological evaluations in dogs. Human intramedullary myelopathies/cavitations are associated with severe initial SCI and deterioration of clinical signs. Canine intervertebral disc extrusions share similarities with SCI in humans. In this descriptive study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in spinal cords of dogs suffering from chronic post-traumatic <b>myelopathies,</b> including cavitations, are elucidated. An additional aim {{of the study was}} to compare diagnostic imaging and histopathological findings and identify similarities between human and canine chronic post-traumatic spinal cord lesions. Thirty-seven dogs with thoracolumbar SCI and one or more 3 Tesla MRI investigations more than 3 weeks after SCI were included. Extent of intramedullary lesions and particularly cavitations were evaluated and measured in sagittal and transverse MRI planes. These data were compared with clinical data. A total of 91. 9 % of study patients developed chronic intramedullary lesions, and 86. 5 % developed intramedullary cavitations. Paraplegia without deep pain perception at initial examination was significantly associated with longer chronic myelopathies/cavitations (P = 0. 002 /P = 0. 008), and with larger maximal cross-sectional area (mCSA) of the lesions (P = 0. 041 / 0. 005). In addition, a non-ambulatory status after decompressive surgery was also associated with the development of longer intramedullary lesions/cavitations (P< 0. 001) and larger lesion mCSA (P< 0. 001 /P = 0. 012). All dogs with negative outcome developed myelopathies/cavitations. In the group of 21 dogs with positive outcome, 3 did not develop any <b>myelopathies,</b> and 5 did not develop cavitations. Development of chronic intramedullary lesions/cavitations are common findings in canine SCI. Extensive chronic intramedullary lesions/cavitations reflect a severe initial SCI and negative clinical outcome. This supports the hypothesis that chronic spinal cord changes following SCI in humans share similarities with canine chronic spinal cord changes after spontaneous intervertebral disc extrusion...|$|R

500|$|Posterior cord syndrome, {{in which}} just the dorsal columns of {{the spinal cord}} are affected, is usually seen in cases of chronic <b>myelopathy</b> but can also occur with {{infarction}} of the posterior spinal artery. [...] This rare syndrome causes the loss of proprioception and sense of vibration {{below the level of}} injury while motor function and sensation of pain, temperature, and touch remain intact. [...] Usually posterior cord injuries result from insults like disease or vitamin deficiency rather than trauma. Tabes dorsalis, due to injury to the posterior part of the spinal cord caused by syphilis, results in loss of touch and proprioceptive sensation.|$|E

Heartwater (Ehrlichia ruminantium) is a tick-borne rickettsial disease that affects the black wildebeest and, as the blue wildebeest is fatally affected by rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease, it is believed that the black wildebeest is also likely to be susceptible to these. Malignant catarrhal fever is a fatal disease of domestic cattle caused by a gammaherpesvirus. It seems that, like the blue wildebeest, the black wildebeest acts as a reservoir for the virus and that all animals are carriers, being persistently infected but showing no symptoms. The virus is transmitted from mother to calf during the gestation period or soon after birth.|$|E
50|$|Possible biomedical-oriented {{applications}} {{of this technique}} {{are related to the}} study of the myelin and <b>myelopathies.</b> Myelin is a highly ordered structure, in which many lipid-enriched, densely compacted phospholipid bilayers are spirally rolled up around thecylindrical axons. The linear acyl chains of the phospholipid molecules present aperpendicular orientation with respect to the myelin surface. Therefore, in a myelinated nervefiber, a large number of molecular bonds are ordered around a radial axis of symmetry. Such astrong molecular anisotropy and azimuthal symmetry make RP-CARS a suitable tool to investigateneural white matter.|$|R
40|$|Schistosomal myeloradiculopathy (SMR), {{the most}} severe and {{disabling}} ectopic form of Schistosoma mansoni infection, is caused by embolized ova eliciting local inflammation in the spinal cord and nerve roots. The treatment {{involves the use of}} praziquantel and long-term corticotherapy. The assessment of therapeutic response relies on neurological examination. Supplementary electrophysiological exams may improve prediction and monitoring of functional outcome. Vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) triggered by galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) is a simple, safe, low-cost and noninvasive electrophysiological technique that has been used to test the vestibulospinal tract in motor <b>myelopathies.</b> This paper reports the results of VEMP with GVS in patients with SMR. A cross-sectional comparative study enrolled 22 patients with definite SMR and 22 healthy controls that were submitted to clinical, neurological examination and GVS. Galvanic stimulus was applied in the mastoid bones in a transcranial configuration for testing VEMP, which was recorded by electromyography (EMG) in the gastrocnemii muscles. The VEMP variables of interest were blindly measured by two independent examiners. They were the short-latency (SL) and the medium-latency (ML) components of the biphasic EMG wave. VEMP showed the components SL (p = 0. 001) and ML (p< 0. 001) delayed in SMR compared to controls. The delay of SL (p = 0. 010) and of ML (p = 0. 020) was associated with gait dysfunction. VEMP triggered by GVS identified alterations in patients with SMR and provided additional functional information that justifies its use as a supplementary test in motor <b>myelopathies...</b>|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND : Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is {{commonly}} acquired in dogs with intervertebral disk herniation (IVDH) {{and is a}} common method to assess inflammatory responses following spinal cord injury (SCI). OBJECTIVES : The {{purpose of the study}} was to describe relationships between cisternal CSF characteristics, behavioral measures of SCI, T 2 weighted (T 2 W) hyperintensity on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and long-term outcome in dogs with IVDH. Diagnostic accuracy of CSF for differentiating IVDH from other <b>myelopathies</b> was also assessed. METHODS : The retrospective case series included 727 dogs, 443 with thoracolumbar IVDH, 103 with cervical IVDH, and 181 with other spinal cord diseases. Signalment, initial neurologic function, ambulatory function at long-term follow-up, T 2 W MRI, and CSF variables were recorded for dogs with IVDH. Signalment, etiology, and CSF data were retrieved for dogs with other <b>myelopathies.</b> Associations between CSF predictors, diagnosis, and outcomes were assessed. RESULTS : CSF total nucleated cell count (TNCC) increased with SCI severity (rho - 0. 256, P<. 001) in dogs with IVDH, TNCC was significantly higher in the presence of T 2 W hyperintensity (P =. 001) in dogs with thoracolumbar IVDH, but TNCC, RBC count, microprotein, and percent neutrophils decreased with increasing injury duration (rho - 0. 253, P<. 001; rho - 0. 269, P<. 001; rho - 0. 141, P=. 004, and rho - 0. 356, P <. 001, respectively). CSF characteristics were not accurate for differentiating IVDH from other spinal cord diseases. CONCLUSIONS : In dogs with IVDH, CSF TNCC, RBC count, microprotein, and percent neutrophils are correlated to clinical aspects of SCI such as injury severity and duration, but cannot differentiate IVDH from other etiologies.
