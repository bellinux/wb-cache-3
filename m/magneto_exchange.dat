50|$|In 1958 the Triangle Telephone Company was acquired, {{a company}} that {{operated}} in Hillsboro Upper Village, Hillsboro Lower Village, Windsor and Washington. This company consisted of a <b>magneto</b> <b>exchange</b> operated {{out of the home}} of the owners, Mr. and Mrs. R.V. Hodgeman, in Hillsboro Upper Village.|$|E
50|$|The St Helier <b>magneto</b> <b>exchange,</b> {{based at}} New Street, St Helier, was {{replaced}} in 1926 {{by a new}} CB1-type exchange installed in a new building in Minden Place in 1926 and renamed Central exchange. This exchange also subsumed Samarès exchange at the same time. St Mary's exchange was merged with St Ouen's exchange in 1927. Exchanges at Five Oaks, Trinity, Gorey, St Aubin and Millbrook were converted from magneto to CB10 during 1938, some moving to new buildings at the same time.|$|E
50|$|Along with {{increased}} {{trade and the}} development of townships, the number of telephone subscribers in Peninsular Malaysia increased significantly. By 1930, to deal with the volume of telephony traffic, an automated <b>magneto</b> <b>exchange</b> was commissioned in Kuala Lumpur on Jalan Weld. In the 1930s, all telephone exchanges in the Malayan Trunk System could communicate with exchanges in Java, the Philippines, the US, Canada and Mexico using shortwave radio-telephone transmitters. Towards the end of the decade, a Marconi Radio Terminal was installed at the Kuala Lumpur Telephone Exchange to handle overseas calls.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1890s a new smaller {{style of}} {{telephone}} was introduced, packaged in three parts. The transmitter {{stood on a}} stand, known as a [...] "candlestick" [...] for its shape. When not in use, the receiver hung on a hook with a switch in it, known as a [...] "switchhook". Previous telephones required the user to operate a separate switch to connect either the voice or the bell. With the new kind, the user was less likely to leave the phone [...] "off the hook". In phones connected to <b>magneto</b> <b>exchanges,</b> the bell, induction coil, battery and magneto were in a separate bell box or [...] "ringer box". In phones connected to common battery exchanges, the ringer box was installed under a desk, or other {{out of the way}} place, since it did not need a battery or magneto.|$|R

5000|$|Bryant Pond in Woodstock, Maine {{was known}} as having the last manual <b>magneto</b> (hand-crank) {{telephone}} <b>exchange</b> in America. The family-owned Bryant Pond Telephone Company was operated from a two-position magneto switchboard {{in the living room}} of owners Barbara and Elden Hathaway. In 1981 the company was purchased by the Oxford County Telephone & Telegraph Company, a nearby larger independent company, and automatic service was provided in 1983.|$|R
50|$|The first {{telephone}} exchange was opened in Jersey in 1888 by the Western Counties and South Wales Telephone Company but {{the service was}} suspended in 1891. A telephone number first featured in a Jersey Times and British Press advert - H Elliot’s Springfield Nursery & 34 King Street Telephone No 18 - on 18 August 1888. The exchange which was installed {{on the first floor}} of 66 Bath Street on the corner of Minden Place was taken over in 1895 when the company was incorporated into the National Telephone Company (NTC) and is very close to the present day main exchange building in Saint Helier. This exchange was moved to 2 New Street in 1901. The Jersey exchange network was taken over in 1912 by the British General Post Office (GPO) when the NTC licence expired, and then comprised some 14 <b>magneto</b> <b>exchanges</b> and 1,313 subscribers. The GPO offered the system to the States of Jersey but the offer was declined. The GPO managed the system until it was again offered to and then bought by the States of Jersey in 1923 for £32,000 (approximately £1.3 million today), and named the States Telephone Department. On takeover there were still 14 exchanges with a total of 1,598 subscribers. The Post Office awarded the States a thirty-year licence with a royalty of 10% of revenue per annum. The first Engineer Manager was Alfred Rosling Bennett MIEE, a renowned telephone engineer who had previously assisted the States of Guernsey and Kingston-upon-Hull Corporation set up their telephone systems. Off island communications continued to be operated by the GPO.|$|R
