5|$|Some {{more modern}} steels include tool steels, which are alloyed with {{large amounts of}} {{tungsten}} and cobalt or other elements to maximize solution hardening. This also allows the use of precipitation hardening and improves the alloy's temperature resistance. Tool steel is generally used in axes, drills, and other devices that need a sharp, long-lasting cutting edge. Other special-purpose alloys include weathering steels such as Cor-ten, which weather by acquiring a stable, rusted surface, and so can be used un-painted. <b>Maraging</b> <b>steel</b> is alloyed with nickel and other elements, but unlike most steel contains little carbon (0.01%).

40|$|<b>Maraging</b> <b>steels</b> are iron-nickel alloys {{having an}} unusual {{combination}} of {{high mechanical strength}} and high toughness. In this work, the effects of laser welding and postweld heat treatments have been analyzed. The fusion zone showed a cellular-dendritic morphology with a relatively low hardness (approximate to 450 HV) compared to the heat-affected zones (HAZs) and base material (approximate to 500 HV). The segregation in the fusion zone increases the tendency of austenite phase formation during aging. The solutionized and aged coupons presented the highest yield strength values (approximate to 1890 MPa). Homogenization treatment showed to be effective on eliminating the as-cast dendritic structure of the fusion zone, but decreased the yield strength to about 1350 MPa, showing that this treatment should be used carefully.

50|$|The common, non-stainless grades contain 17-19 wt.% nickel, 8-12 wt.% cobalt, 3-5 wt.% molybdenum, and 0.2-1.6 wt.% titanium. Addition of {{chromium}} produces stainless grades {{resistant to}} corrosion. This also indirectly increases hardenability as they require less nickel: high-chromium, high-nickel steels are generally austenitic {{and unable to}} transform to martensite when heat treated, while lower-nickel steels can transform to martensite. Alternative variants of Ni-reduced <b>maraging</b> <b>steels</b> are based on alloys of Fe and Mn plus minor additions of Al, Ni, and Ti where compositions between Fe-9wt.% Mn to Fe-15wt.% Mn have been used. The Mn has a similar effect as Ni, i.e. it stabilizes the austenite phase. Hence, depending on their Mn content, Fe-Mn <b>maraging</b> <b>steels</b> can be fully martensitic after quenching them from the high temperature austenite phase or they can contain retained austenite. The latter effect enables the design of maraging-TRIP steels where TRIP stands for Transformation-Induced-Plasticity.|$|R

Data from microhardness tests, scanning electron microscopy, electron backscatter diffraction, x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy were used to characterize the microstructure of the layers.
