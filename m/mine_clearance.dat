5|$|After the war, {{construction}} and reconstruction work resumed on the A3 motorway. The battle damage {{was the first}} to be addressed, along with removal of the trenches excavated in the flyover embankments. Similarly, unexploded ordnance and minefields left around the motorway had to be removed by minesweepers. The motorway pavement was seriously deteriorated, as evidenced by extensive ruts and cracks incurred during the four-year wartime period. Unlike repairs made to the viaducts and flyovers, <b>mine</b> <b>clearance</b> and pavement reconstruction took considerably more time to perform.|$|E

25|$|Demining or <b>mine</b> <b>clearance</b> is {{the process}} of {{removing}} land mines from an area, while minesweeping describes the act of detecting mines. There are two distinct types of mine detection and removal: military and humanitarian.|$|E
25|$|Still in {{development}} as of 2003, the Rapid Airborne <b>Mine</b> <b>Clearance</b> System (RAMICS) {{can be considered}} an armament subsystem (and {{one of the largest}} guns ever fitted to a helicopter), though its intended targets are strictly naval mines. Consisting of a single modified Mk 44 Mod 0 30mm cannon firing the Mk 248 Mod 1 Armor-Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding-Sabot Tracer (APFSDS-T) round, the RAMICS was intended to be mounted in the cabin of the MH-60S helicopter, and using its associated sensor package, target and neutralize mines at relatively shallow depths. The system is designed to provide a quick and effective <b>mine</b> <b>clearance</b> capability to complement existing methods and others under development for the Navy's Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM) Program.|$|E

25|$|For {{almost five}} years, the {{division}} {{remained in the}} UK on Home Defence and training, mainly at Stone Street near Folkestone in Kent. During that time, the three field companies 'bridged and re-bridged almost every river in Kent', and developed techniques for <b>mine</b> <b>clearance.</b>|$|E
25|$|In these <b>mine</b> <b>clearance</b> operations, {{the methods}} that are applied for {{detection}} and removal are quicker, but less exacting. These methods include those that detect and remove {{in a single}} action, such as mechanical demining, carpet bombing, burning of the land {{or the use of}} Bangalore torpedoes or mine-clearing line charges.|$|E

30|$|Almost 10  years {{after the}} first fatal burst, the seventh {{longwall}} panel was being retreated at Mine A under almost 840  m of cover (MSHA 2006). Bounces were common along the longwall face, ranging from thumps in the roof or floor to coal being blown from the face. These events occurred all along the longwall face, but were most common near the headgate and tailgate entries. “Bounce procedures” were in place to protect the workers by limiting access to the face when the shearer was near the gate entries and specifying that shearer operators should position themselves behind the 8  m long deflector shields mounted above the shearer. The deflector shields were hinged off the shearer frame to be lowered or raised to accommodate <b>mining</b> <b>clearance.</b> In addition, expanded metal guards were attached to the armored face conveyor periodically along the walkway, and sheets of conveyor belting were suspended {{from the bottom of}} shield canopies along the walkway.|$|R

5|$|There are {{two parts}} to the RAN's structure. One is an {{operational}} command, Fleet Command, {{and the other}} is a support command, Navy Strategic Command. The Navy's assets are administered by four 'forces' which report to the Commander Australian Fleet. These are the Fleet Air Arm, the <b>Mine</b> Warfare, <b>Clearance</b> Diving, Hydrographic, Meteorological and Patrol Force, Submarine Force and Surface Force. All naval bases across Australia also report to the Commander Australian Fleet.|$|R
25|$|Special {{machines}} effectively combine mine {{detection and}} removal into one operation. In the past, these machines were applied in both <b>mine</b> <b>clearance</b> and demining but are now generally {{used only for}} demining. They {{can be used to}} verify land that is not expected to be contaminated or as an extra layer of security after an area has been cleared by another method, such as dogs.|$|E
25|$|After the war, SuomenJoutsen {{participated in}} the {{demining}} of the Finnish coastal waters, for which purpose she was fitted with an engine repair shop and a sauna for the crews of the minesweepers. She served in this task until the <b>mine</b> <b>clearance</b> was finished in 1948, but was afterwards used as an accommodation and supply ship for different branches of the Finnish Navy. In 1955–1959 she was stationed in Upinniemi.|$|E
25|$|Three days later, the {{negotiating}} parties announced {{an agreement on}} the release of minors under 15 years of age from FARC camps {{as well as a}} road map for the release of all other minors and a special program for their care. On June 10, the creation of an illicit crop substitution pilot project in Briceño (where the <b>mine</b> <b>clearance</b> pilot project was organized) was announced from Cuba.|$|E

25|$|Concrete {{measures}} {{to contribute to}} reparation: All those who have caused harm {{in the context of}} the conflict would be able to participate in concrete restorative actions, which would be taken into account to receive special legal benefits under the JEP. For the FARC, these measures would include reconstruction of infrastructure, <b>mine</b> <b>clearance</b> and decontamination, participation in illicit crop substitution programs, participation in the search for missing persons and environmental conservation projects (e.g., reforestation). The government would promote the participation in such projects of agents of the State and others who participated (directly or indirectly) in the conflict.|$|E
25|$|The risk to sappers is {{far greater}} because they may {{be called upon to}} perform {{clearance}} as tactics dictate, including in all-weather conditions and on schedule. Command may accept casualties in the process. Furthermore, it is accepted that <b>mine</b> <b>clearance</b> will be imperfect and there may be casualties from undiscovered mines. One advantage is that, in military operations, sappers are dealing with recently laid mines that respond predictably to clearance, have not 'migrated', and have not degraded (unless old stock was used). In this they are often aided by technical intelligence on the current adversary's mines, which are usually of a single type.|$|E
25|$|Chechnya is {{the most}} land mine-affected region worldwide. Since 1994 there have been {{widespread}} use of mines, by both sides (Russia is {{a party to the}} 1980 Convention on Conventional Weapons but not the 1996 protocol on land mines and other devices). The most heavily mined areas of Chechnya are those in which separatists continue to put up resistance, namely the southern regions, as well as the borders of the republic. No humanitarian <b>mine</b> <b>clearance</b> has taken place since the HALO Trust was evicted by Russia in December 1999. In June 2002, Olara Otunnu, the UN official, estimated that there were 500,000 land mines placed in the region. UNICEF has recorded 2,340 civilian land mine and unexploded ordnance casualties occurring in Chechnya between 1999 and the end of 2003.|$|E
5000|$|A {{chronicler of}} the North Sea <b>Mine</b> Barrage <b>clearance</b> wrote about 9 July: [...] "...misfortune did not rain; it poured". Mines damaged three minesweepers, the tug, , and a subchaser. Again {{sweeping}} in company with Eider, Auk hit a mine at 0925 that detonated another mine 25 yd off her starboard bow {{in a chain}} reaction; {{there was also a}} third explosion (probably caused by the second) 30 yards astern, carrying away the sweep and resulting in the loss of a [...] "kite" [...] and 70 fathom m of wire.|$|R
50|$|Assessing flail {{effectiveness}} is difficult, {{as it is}} hard to distinguish between a mine that has been missed by the flail and an aged, malfunctioning mine that has been struck but has failed to detonate. To be sure which is the case, it would be necessary to disassemble the mine and examine its fuze - a lengthy and dangerous procedure that is hardly ever carried out in the field. Because of this, all apparently intact mines are reported as being 'missed' by the flail and {{it has been suggested that}} this leads to an under-reporting of the <b>mine</b> flail's <b>clearance</b> reliability.|$|R
5000|$|The United Kingdom {{destroyed}} {{the majority of}} its inventory of anti-personnel mines {{under the terms of the}} Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention. In a report to the Convention in April 2015 it declared that it retains 724 foreign manufactured anti-personnel mines solely for training and development of <b>mine</b> detection and <b>clearance</b> techniques as permitted by the treaty.|$|R
