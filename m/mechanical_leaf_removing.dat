40|$|Herbivore-induced {{volatiles}} are {{widespread in}} plants. They {{can serve as}} alert signals that enable neighbouring leaves and plants to pre-emptively increase defences and avoid herbivory damage. However, our understanding about the factors mediating volatile organic compound (VOC) signal interpretation by receiver plants {{and the degree to}} which multiple herbivores affect VOC signals is still limited. Here we investigated whether plant responses to damage-induced VOC signals were population specific. As a secondary goal, we tested for interference in signal production or reception when plants were subjected to multiple types of herbivore damage. We factorially crossed the population sources of paired Phaseolus lunatus plants (same vs. different population sources) with a mechanical damage treatment to one member of the pair (i. e. the VOC emitter, damaged vs. control), and we measured herbivore damage to the other plant (the VOC receiver) in the field. Prior to the experiment, both emitter and receiver plants were naturally colonized by aphids, enabling us to test the hypothesis that damage from sap-feeding herbivores interferes with VOC communication by including emitter and receiver aphid abundances as covariates in our analyses. One week after <b>mechanical</b> <b>leaf</b> damage, we <b>removed</b> all the emitter plants from the field and conducted fortnightly surveys of leaf herbivory. We found evidence that receiver plants responded using population-specific “dialects” where only receivers from the same source population as the damaged emitters suffered less leaf damage upon exposure to the volatile signals. We also found that the abundance of aphids on both emitter and receiver plants did not alter this volatile signalling during both production and reception despite well-documented defence crosstalk within individual plants that are simultaneously attacked by multiple herbivores. Overall, these results show that plant communication is highly sensitive to genetic relatedness between emitter and receiver plants and that communication is resilient to herbivore co-infestation.

40|$|Detasseling {{is used in}} {{hybrid corn}} (Zea mays L.) seed {{production}} to ensure harvested seeds have the desired genetic complement. Both mechanical and hand detasseling result in loss of some leaf tissue and plant N. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine if seed yield and quality and N content of grain and stover were affected by leaf removal during detasseling. The treatments evaluated were removal of tassel only, tassel plus one leaf, tassel plus two leaves, tassel plus three leaves, tassel plus four leaves, and no tissue <b>removed</b> (control). The <b>leaf</b> area index (LAI) declined linearly, about 0. 16 LAI units per <b>leaf</b> <b>removed.</b> Grain and stover yield also declined linearly with number of leaves removed with the tassel (r 2 = 0. 97 and 0. 92, respectively). Each <b>leaf</b> <b>removed</b> reduced grain yield about 0. 36 Mg ha- 1. Yield reduction was caused by decreased kernel size. Grain and stover N concentration and amount of N in stover did not vary among detasseled treatments. However, total N in the grain declined linearly as number of leaves removed increased (r 2 = 0. 97). Warm and cold germination and warm germination after accelerated aging were not affected by leaf removal during detasseling. Results reported here suggest that when leaves are removed from the plant at detasseling, the loss of photosynthetic capacity, the ability to intercept light, and plant N all contribute to grain yield reduction...|$|R

Journal of Chemical Ecology, 35, (4), 469 - 475. IMPF: 02. 41 RONO: 00 Sponsorship: Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Illinois at Urbana?ChampaignA field {{study on the}} effects of current grazing practices on plants in central Norway found no increase in either phenolic compounds or proteinase inhibitors in plants subjected to grazing by sheep. This could either reflect insufficient damage to the plants due to low grazing intensity or a lack of a long-term response of the plants to grazing. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that damage to forage plants used by sheep and rodents in Norwegian alpine rangelands can stimulate a long-term (at least 2 -week) increase in levels of defensive compounds. We used clipping experiments to manipulate the severity and timing of damage to eight species of common plants used by herbivores in Norway. Under greenhouse conditions (i. e., climate-controlled), we subjected mature plants to one of four clipping treatments: control (0 % <b>leaf</b> tissue <b>removed),</b> low (10 ? 15 % <b>leaf</b> tissue <b>removed),</b> high (70 ? 75 % <b>leaf</b> tissue <b>removed),</b> or sustained (15 % of <b>leaf</b> tissue <b>removed</b> every other day up to a total removal of 75 %, i. e., five clippings over 9 days). Samples were collected 2 weeks after final clipping and analyzed for concentrations of total phenolics, proteinase inhibitors, ratio of total phenolics to soluble proteins, and ratio of proteinase inhibitors to soluble plant proteins. As expected, the different species of plants responded differently to simulated herbivory, but most plants either showed no response to mechanical wounding and tissue loss or had reduced defensive compounds. Thus, our results do not support the hypothesis that herbivory induces a long-term increase in defensive compounds in alpine rangelands of Norway, a result consistent with those from field studies.

The aim {{was to investigate the}} effects of two different ways of defoliation on plant physiology, vegetative parameters, yield and grape quality in a warm temperature area. Fruit zone defoliation consisted of mechanical (MLR) and hand leaf removal (HLR), applied either to both sides of the canopy (Northweast and Southeast). These treatments were applied when the berries had reached pea size and compared to a non-defoliated treatment (control). Hand and <b>mechanical</b> <b>leaf</b> removal caused different and significant reduction in leaf area per shoot modifying leaf-to-fruit ratio.

Consequently, differences in canopy architecture were measured at pea size and harvest. Photosynthetic activity of primary leaves was higher in leaf removal treatments than in non-defoliated. In HLR must sugar (°Brix) tended to increase during ripeness process, but at harvest no significant differences among treatments were found. Skin total anthocyanins was lower in HLR and the control vines showed the highest values.

40|$|Physiological {{responses}} of the halophyte, Atriplex subspicata Nutt. Rydb., to defoliation injury were evaluated {{through a series of}} experiments measuring plant gas exchange, fluorometry, and enzyme activity. Leaves exposed to simulated insect herbivory exhibited reductions in photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and transpiration. Carboxylation efficiency, maximum assimilation, and CO 2 compensation were also negatively associated with <b>mechanical</b> <b>leaf</b> injury. Insect injury by a herbivore generalist, Spilosoma virginica, also reduced photosynthesis and carboxylation efficiency within the saturated spectrum of A/Ci response curves. Initially, declines in photosynthesis occurred because of transient stomatal limitations. However, after time, mesophyll limitations impaired photosynthesis and the plant’s ability to compensate for injury. Fluorescence data and light assimilation responses indicated that defoliation did not play a role in limiting light reactions of photosynthesis. Enzyme analyses showed increased peroxidase activity with insect injury, suggesting the need for future characterization of oxidative enzymes, which have been associated with traits of resistance. Overall, we found a salt-tolerant plant to be susceptible to insect herbivory through a reduction in the efficiency of the plant to allocate energy resources. If salt tolerance comes at the cost of susceptibility to biotic interference, natural occurring halophytes or plants with transgenic salt tolerance may be at risk for heightened deleterious response to insect herbivory...|$|R

Eliminating 36 % of the more functional leaves (i. e. median leaves and a fraction of well-expanded apical leaves of either primary and lateral shoots) resulted an effective, easy-to-do and economically viable method (it required only 3 - 4 hours per hectare) to slow grape ripening and obtain grapes with reduced soluble solids concentration and wine with lower alcohol content (- 0. 6 %). Concurrently, the concentration of phenolics compounds in the grapes, the chemical and chromatic characteristics of the wines and the replenishment of the reserves (alcohol-soluble sugars, starch and total nitrogen) in the stems and roots were unaffected {{as compared to the}} non defoliated vines.

In the test, the insulation of the greenhouse was increased by separating the existing 2 -layers of the light tight screen, creating an air layer of 5 cm in between them. This improved the temperature layering between the greenhouse and the greenhouse cover, resulting in very low net radiation losses by the crop. The applied light-dependent temperature strategy proved technically and physiologically suitable between November and May. The day length in winter was gradually extended to 13 or 15 hours, with a proportional increase of the average day temperature (at least 16 °C) according to the light dependent temperature strategy. This saved some energy on heat, but required more electricity without improving production or quality; on the contrary, the crop showed an increased vegetative growth.

Physiological changes in response to treatment included: a higher rate of photosynthesis, an increase in root initials, an increase in fruit number, and osmotic adjustment that pre-adapted transplants to water stress. Production changes caused by treatments included: {{an increase in the number}} of harvestable daughter transplants produced in the nurseries with ProCa application, decreased irrigation requirement, and increased early or seasonal fruit yield in mowed and ProCa-treated plants in some but not all years.
