5|$|The Minnesota Territorial Legislature {{recognized}} Saint Anthony as {{a town in}} 1855 and <b>Minneapolis</b> in 1856.

5|$|The {{development}} of sawmills and flour mills at the falls spurred demand for railroad service to <b>Minneapolis.</b> In 1868, <b>Minneapolis</b> was only {{served by a}} spur from St. Paul, from the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, and by the fledgling St. Paul and Pacific Railroad. <b>Minneapolis</b> millers found that railroads based in Milwaukee and Chicago were favoring their cities by diverting wheat from <b>Minneapolis</b> mills. In response, the owners of several <b>Minneapolis</b> mills chartered the <b>Minneapolis</b> and St. Louis Railway, which would connect the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad through <b>Minneapolis</b> to the Iowa border. Meanwhile, Jay Cooke {{took control of the}} St. Paul and Pacific Railroad in 1871 with the goal of aggregating it into the Northern Pacific Railway. Bad economic conditions caused the Panic of 1873, and the Northern Pacific had to relinquish control of the St. Paul and Pacific Railroad and the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad.|$|E

5|$|Dworkin and MacKinnon, however, {{continued}} to discuss civil rights litigation {{as a possible}} approach to combating pornography. In the fall of 1983, MacKinnon secured a one-semester appointment for Dworkin at the University of Minnesota, to teach a course in literature for the Women's Studies program and co-teach (with MacKinnon) an interdepartmental course on pornography, where they hashed out details of a civil rights approach.

5|$|From about 200,000 in the 1900 Census, <b>Minneapolis</b> {{soared to}} its highest {{population}} recorded in 1950 of over 521,000 people.

With 140 million passengers by 1920, the streetcars ran down important roads extending from Downtown <b>Minneapolis.</b> Neighborhood residential development out of the core mostly dates {{around the turn of the}} century as a result of this system. This growth also allowed <b>Minneapolis</b> to annex land from neighboring villages and townships which subsequently pushed the incorporation of today's inner ring suburbs.|$|E

5|$|Minnehaha Falls {{received}} pilgrimages {{from fans}} of Longfellow's The Song of Hiawatha by the 1870s. At the same time, business {{people wanted to}} harness its power. In 1884 Loring advocated a Minnesota state park at Minnehaha Falls, a goal the state {{tried and failed to}} achieve. In 1888, Cleveland presented The Aesthetic Development of the United Cities of St. Paul and <b>Minneapolis</b> at the <b>Minneapolis</b> Society of Fine Arts and convinced the city to preserve the waterfall and to build a city park there. In the 1890s, Cleveland's Minnehaha Park was annexed to <b>Minneapolis</b> and completed the Grand Rounds. Today Minnehaha Park sees 500,000 visitors each year. Named by Folwell, the 52-mile (83km) Grand Rounds circles from Northeast, <b>Minneapolis</b> to Theodore Wirth Park, to the Chain of Lakes and follows the Mississippi River upstream past Minnehaha Falls to downtown.|$|E

[...] During his first term, Johnson has worked on overhauling rules from <b>Minneapolis's</b> code of ordinances that he sees as outdated, contradictory, or obstructive to small businesses. These efforts have led to lowering licensing fees for second-hand shops, making it more accessible for businessowners to have murals on their buildings, eliminating an ordinance banning patrons from wearing hats in movie theaters. During his first term, he has also authored an ordinance to clarify <b>Minneapolis's</b> rules on pets and wildlife, including making urban chicken coops more accessible, permitting the ownership of reptiles, and instituting a no-kill policy for the city's animal control agency. He led an effort to end the city of <b>Minneapolis's</b> IT services contract with Unisys at an annual savings of $3 million {{to the city and}} introduced language eliminating the requirement for single-use restrooms in city businesses to be designated either female or male, allowing instead for gender neutral single-use bathrooms.|$|R
