5|$|According {{to their}} Confucian ethics, elite and cultured scholar-officials viewed {{themselves}} as the pinnacle members of society (second only to the imperial family). Rural farmers were seen as the essential pillars that provided food for all of society; they were given more respect than the local or regional merchant, no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> rich and powerful. The Confucian-taught scholar-official elite who ran China's vast bureaucracy viewed their society's growing interest in commercialism {{as a sign of}} moral decay. Nonetheless, Song Chinese urban society was teeming with wholesalers, shippers, storage keepers, brokers, traveling salesmen, retail shopkeepers, peddlers, and many other lowly commercial-based vocations.|$|E
5|$|Because the feats the Baron {{describes}} are overtly implausible, {{they are}} easily recognizable as fiction, {{with a strong}} implication that the Baron is a liar. Whether he expects his audience to believe him varies from version to version; in Raspe's original 1785 text, he simply narrates his stories without further comment, but in the later extended versions he is insistent that he is telling the truth. In any case, the Baron appears to believe every word of his own stories, no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> internally inconsistent they become, and he usually appears tolerantly indifferent to any disbelief he encounters in others.|$|E

5|$|Many unpitched {{percussion}} instruments, {{such as the}} snare drum or maracas, {{make use}} of the presence of random sounds or noise to produce a sound without any perceived pitch. See timbre. Unpitched percussion is typically used to maintain a rhythm or to provide accents, and its sounds are unrelated to the melody and harmony of the music. Within the orchestra unpitched percussion is termed auxiliary percussion, and this subsection of the percussion section includes all unpitched instruments of the orchestra no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> they are played, for example the pea whistle and siren.|$|E

5|$|Paraphrasing John Wheeler, Einstein's {{geometric}} {{theory of}} gravity {{can be summarized}} thus: spacetime tells <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.

5|$|Sharaf {{writes that}} Reich's {{personality}} changed after {{his experience in}} Oslo. He became socially isolated and kept his distance even from old friends and his ex-wife.

In January 1940 he wrote to Lindenberg to end their relationship once and for all, telling her that he was in despair and that he believed he would end up dying like a dog.|$|E
5|$|The {{explanation}} of this instability {{begins with the}} existence of tiny perturbations in the stream. These are always present, no <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> smooth the stream is. If the perturbations are resolved into sinusoidal components, we find that some components grow with time while others decay with time. Among those that grow with time, some grow at faster rates than others. Whether a component decays or grows, and how fast it grows is entirely a function of its wave number (a measure of how many peaks and troughs per centimeter) and the radii of the original cylindrical stream.|$|E
