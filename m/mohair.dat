The state also {{leads the nation}} in production of cotton which is the number one crop grown in the state in terms of value. The state grows significant amounts of cereal crops and produce. Texas has a large commercial fishing industry. With mineral resources, Texas leads in creating cement, crushed stone, lime, salt, sand and gravel.|$|E
5|$|Textiles {{from the}} most {{utilitarian}} to the most luxurious are made from animal fibres such as wool, camel hair, angora, cashmere, and <b>mohair.</b> Hunter-gatherers have used animal sinews as lashings and bindings. Leather from cattle, pigs and other species is widely used to make shoes, handbags, belts and many other items. Animals have been hunted and farmed for their fur, to make items such as coats and hats, again ranging from simply warm and practical to the most elegant and expensive.|$|E

50|$|During the 15th century, {{when the}} Ottomans were gaining a firm {{foothold}} in the region, Albanian towns were organised into four principal sanjaks. The government fostered trade by settling a sizeable Jewish colony of refugees fleeing persecution in Spain (at {{the end of the}} 15th century). The city of Vlorë saw passing through its ports imported merchandise from Europe such as velvets, cotton goods, <b>mohairs,</b> carpets, spices, and leather from Bursa and Constantinople. Some citizens of Vlorë even had business associates throughout Europe.|$|R

25|$|A major {{employer}} was Titus Salt who in 1833 {{took over}} the running of his father's woollen business specialising in fabrics combining alpaca, <b>mohair,</b> cotton and silk. By 1850 he had five mills. However, because of the polluted environment and squalid conditions for his workers Salt left Bradford and transferred his business to Salts Mill in Saltaire in 1850, where in 1853 he began to build the workers' village {{which has become a}} UNESCO World Heritage site.|$|E
25|$|The company still uses {{traditional}} methods and materials (such as <b>mohair</b> for its bears) {{to produce a}} limited range of hand-crafted toys, appealing to {{the high end of}} the market. The founder's grandson, Oliver Holmes, ran the business as managing director until his death in 2011; his eldest daughter, Sarah Holmes, has been involved in its management since 2010, and middle daughter Hannah Holmes since 2011, thereby continuing the Holmes family connection. As of 2011, all four shareholders are members of the Holmes family.|$|E

[...] "Notwithstanding, {{there will be many}} charming creatures among them, and they shall be welcome. Well, Littlepage, I do not despair of having you among us; for, to be candid, without wishing to boast, I think you will find the ----th as liberal a set of young men as there is in the service. There is a wish to have the <b>mohairs</b> among us instead of {{shutting}} ourselves up altogether in scarlet. Then your father and grandfather have both served, and that will be a famous introduction." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{dare say}} there were fifty young ladies promenading the church-walk when I reached it, and nearly as many young men in {{attendance}} on them; no {{small portion of the}} last being scarlet-coats, though the <b>mohairs</b> had their representatives there too. A few blue-jackets were among us also, there being two or three king's cruisers in port. As no one presumed to promenade the Mall, who was not of a certain stamp of respectability, the company was all gaily dressed; and I will confess that I was much struck with the air of the place, the first time I showed myself among the gay idlers. The impression made on me that morning was so vivid, that I will endeavour to describe the scene, as it now presents itself to my mind.|$|R
25|$|Vegans may avoid {{clothing}} that incorporates silk, wool (including lambswool, shearling, cashmere, angora, <b>mohair,</b> {{and a number}} of other fine wools), fur, feathers, pearls, animal-derived dyes, or leather, snakeskin, or any other kind of skin or animal product. Most leather clothing is made from cow skins. Vegans regard the purchase of leather, particularly from cows, as financial support for the meat industry. Vegans may wear clothing items and accessories made of non-animal-derived materials, such as hemp, linen, cotton, canvas, polyester, synthetic leather (pleather), rubber, or vinyl. Leather alternatives can come from materials, such as cork, piña(from pineapples), and mushroom leather.|$|E
25|$|The Second Empire saw a {{revolution}} in retail commerce, as the Paris middle class and consumer demand grew rapidly. The revolution was fuelled {{in large part by}} Paris fashions, especially the crinoline, which demanded enormous quantities of silk, satin, velour, cashmere, percale, <b>mohair,</b> ribbons, lace and other fabrics and decorations. Before the Second Empire, clothing and luxury shops were small and catered to a very small clientele; their windows were covered with shutters or curtains. Any who entered had to explain their presence to the clerks, and prices were never posted; customers had to ask for them.|$|E

Glass particles found within this basement were of a similar consistency to those found upon the soles of Basom's shoes. Upon conducting a search of the basement of this farmhouse, investigators discovered a further garment of her clothing, a length of electrical flex of the same type used to strangle the victim, and fresh human bloodstains, indicating this location as being the site of Basom's murder.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, Italy {{has been}} a leader in the design of men's suits. The slim fitting suits {{developed}} in the 1960s were widely imitated by the mod subculture, and underwent a large scale revival during the late 2000s to mid 2010s due to their association with James Bond and Don Draper from Mad Men. Due to the humid climate, Italian suits are frequently made in shades of light grey, sand or stone to reflect the sunlight. Typical fabrics include lightweight flannel, a wool and <b>mohair</b> blend, and linen or chino cloth for hot weather.|$|E
25|$|Sir George Grey {{left the}} Cape in 1861. During his {{governorship}} {{the resources of}} the colony had increased {{with the opening of the}} copper mines in Little Namaqualand, the <b>mohair</b> wool industry had been established and Natal made a separate colony. The opening, in November 1863, of the railway from Cape Town to Wellington, and the construction in 1860 of the great breakwater in Table Bay, long needed on that perilous coast, marked the beginning in the colony of public works on a large scale. They were the more-or-less direct result of the granting to the colony of a large share in its own government.|$|E
25|$|To make various yarns, besides adding novelty elements, spinners {{can vary}} {{all the same}} things as in a {{machined}} yarn, i.e., the fibre, the preparation, the colour, the spinning technique, {{the direction of the}} twist, etc. A common misconception is yarn spun from rolags may not be as strong, but the strength of a yarn is actually based on the length of hair fibre and the degree of twist. When working with shorter hairs, such as llama or angora rabbit, the spinner may choose to integrate longer fibres, such as <b>mohair,</b> to prevent yarn breakage. Yarns made of shorter fibres are also given more twist than yarns of longer fibres, and are generally spun with the short draw technique.|$|E
25|$|Male mods {{adopted a}} smooth, {{sophisticated}} look that included tailor-made suits with narrow lapels (sometimes made of <b>mohair),</b> thin ties, button-down collar shirts, wool or cashmere jumpers (crewneck or V-neck), Chelsea or Beatle boots, loafers, Clarks desert boots, bowling shoes, and hairstyles that imitated {{the look of}} French Nouvelle Vague film actors. A few male mods went against gender norms by using eye shadow, eye-pencil or even lipstick. Mods chose scooters over motorbikes partly because they were a symbol of Italian style and because their body panels concealed moving parts and made them less likely to stain clothes with oil or road dust. Many mods wore military parkas while driving scooters {{in order to keep}} their clothes clean.|$|E
25|$|Following on {{from the}} mod revival of the late 70s, the UK {{witnessed}} a revival of rude boy and skinhead fashion due to the popularity of ska punk, Oi! punk rock, rocksteady, and two tone music {{during the winter of}} discontent. In the early 80s, slim fitting <b>mohair,</b> tonic and houndstooth suits were popular, together with basket weave shoes, polo shirts, sta-prest trousers, Doc Martens, braces, Harrington jackets and pork pie hats popularized by bands like the Specials, UB40, the Bosstones, and Madness. In response to the racism of white power skinheads, 1980s rude boys wore checkerboard motifs to signify that both black and white people were welcome. Crew cuts and buzzcuts were worn by both sexes, and girls often incorporated hair bangs in a partially shaven style known as a Chelsea mohawk. In Brighton, the Skins of the 1980s fought the outlaw bikers and rockabilly guys, as the Mods and Rockers had previously done in the 60s.|$|E
25|$|This {{was used}} when {{the best results}} were wanted from long fibred wools and hairs such as <b>mohair,</b> alpaca, long English and {{crossbred}} wools. In the Lister comb, the slivers of wool or hair are fed into the machine over the back plate, through the fluted feed rollers, under the spreader roller and onto the pins of the fallers which disentangle and transport the fibres to the nip jaw. The nip jaw, with its swinging motion, closes in upon the fringe of fibres, grasping them and pulling them out from the faller pins; thus partially combing the fibres which are then received by the carrier comb and conveyed to the pins of the large combing circle into which they are pressed by the dabbing brush. As the large circle rotates, the unique feature of the machine, the side circle comb gives the fibres a secondary combing, removing not the short fibres, but any excessively long ones. The large comb circle carries the remaining fibres to the drawing-off rollers which give the fibres their final combing by removing the long fibres from the circle pins, with the short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the crimping box and into a can directly underneath. The short fibres or noils are removed from the pins of the large comb circle by lifting knives, and deposited into a can ready for removal.|$|E

500|$|Wigs {{were made}} of <b>mohair</b> or, {{in the case of}} the Penelope puppet, human hair. Puppet bodies were built in three sizes: [...] "large male" [...] (specifically for the Tracys and the Hood), [...] "small male" [...] and [...] "small female". Sylvia Anderson, the head costume designer, devised the main characters' attire. To give the puppets {{increased}} mobility, the costume department generally avoided stiff synthetic materials, instead working with cotton, silk and wool. Between 1964 and 1966, the department's stock numbered more than 700 costumes.|$|E

It was always our vision to make her look as sculptural as possible". Fassbender's David is dressed similarly to other crew members, but his outfit was given finer lines to produce a more linear appearance. To create a casual, relaxed appearance, Marshall-Green's Holloway was dressed in hoodies, fisherman pants, and flip-flops, while Elba wore a canvas-greased jacket to represent his long career {{at the helm of}} a ship.|$|E
500|$|Starter kits are {{equipped}} with basic reborning necessities such as limbs, faces, heads, paint brushes, eyelashes, weighting pellets, 'heat set' or air dry paints, cloth bodies, cable ties, nose drill bits, fake tears, thinning shears, cosmetic foam wedges, cotton dipped applicators, and glue [...] These supplies may be purchased separately {{from a variety of}} retailers. The nose drill bits are used for creating and perfecting the nostrils of the doll. Acetone or a paint thinner medium is needed for removing the factory paint from the doll. Hair is an optional choice to add to a doll. Fine <b>mohair,</b> human hair, or wigs are usually used, but it is found in a variety of types. Rooting tools are utilized for this process and are available in numerous sizes 20,36,38, 40, and 42. The smaller the number the thicker the needle which will grab more hair and leave a bigger hole in the head of the doll. Eyes for a reborn doll are offered in a variety of brands and sizes.|$|E
500|$|Weinberg started {{actually}} {{playing at}} the age of six. His first public appearance came {{at the age of}} seven when he sat in on a bar mitzvah band playing [...] "When the Saints Go Marching In". The bandleader, Herbie Zane, was the leading act for bar mitzvahs and weddings in the area; he was impressed with young Weinberg and brought him along on other engagements as a kind of novelty act. Weinberg thus became a local child star, drumming in a three-piece <b>mohair</b> suit. He gained an appreciation for showmanship and was a fan of Liberace and Sammy Davis, Jr. He grew to idolize drummer Buddy Rich and become a fan of Gene Krupa and saw drummer Ed Shaughnessy of Doc Severinsen's band on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson as having an ideal job as well as admiring the level of playing and serious sartorial style of the Tonight Show musicians. Weinberg stayed with Zane until junior high school and learned rhythms such as cha-chas, merenges, polkas, and the hora and playing everything from Dixieland jazz to Acker Bilk's [...] "Stranger on the Shore".|$|E

2500|$|Around 1960, {{the media}} dubbed these people the [...] "Memphis Mafia."

According to one account, {{a crowd of people}} in front of the Riviera Hotel watched as two big black limousines arrived. Elvis and his friends got out of the two cars and someone in the crowd yelled, [...] "Who are they, the Mafia?" [...] and a newspaper reporter picked up the story. The Memphis Mafia members themselves say on their website that Elvis liked the name and it stuck. These original Memphis Mafia members at the time the phrase was coined were Billy Smith, Sonny West, Marty Lacker, Lamar Fike, Joe Esposito, Red West, Charlie Hodge and Alan Fortas.|$|E
2500|$|The Kari-Keen Coupe and the Swanson Coupe {{featured}} the characteristic Swanson cantilever wing design. The Swanson planes also shared a similar seating configuration; the two-passengers were seated beside each other. Model W-15 featured detachable passenger-side controls {{which could be}} mounted or removed depending on whether a student pilot was present. This design feature made the plane suitable for use in flight schools. The cabin windshield was made using safety glass and the door window panes were retractable. The plane had two variants: Standard and Deluxe. Both variants had dual flight controls, low pressure tires and <b>mohair</b> interior. Both models featured dual engine throttle controls: the main throttle control and a secondary throttle control button installed on the brake lever. The Deluxe came with an electric starter and more elaborate instrumentation. The prices were $4,450 for the Standard model and [...] $4,985 for the Deluxe.|$|E
2500|$|As a poet, McGough came to {{national}} prominence through {{the publication of}} The Mersey Sound in 1967. The Mersey Sound is an anthology of poetry by three Liverpool poets: McGough, Brian Patten, and Adrian Henri. It went on to sell over 500,000 copies, {{becoming one of the}} bestselling poetry anthologies of all time; remaining in continuous publication, it was revised in 1983 and again in 2007. The title of the anthology was a conscious association of the three Liverpool poets with the musical phenomenon caused by the eruption of the Beatles and associated bands from the same city, known collectively as the [...] "Merseybeat", on the world. McGough's personal connection with the Beatles was referenced in a much later comic poem, [...] "To Macca's Trousers", contained in the book That Awkward Age (2009). McGough discovered a long forgotten pair of Paul McCartney's blue <b>mohair</b> trousers in his attic; the trousers had been given to him, via McCartney's brother Mike, in the early 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|The company altered {{during the}} 2000s' due to [...] "the ongoing effects of {{external}} economics", specifically cheap foreign-produced goods with which Merrythought could not compete {{due to the}} high production costs associated with manufacturing in the UK. Merrythought's extensive range of plush animals (which were all British made) was no longer competitive against products from overseas so production of these products ceased. In 2007 a catalogue was revealed, with a [...] "much sharper, collector-focused group of products", focusing on the traditional <b>mohair</b> teddy bears that Merrythought had become most famous for since the 1930s. From 2007 to 2010 an independent company took on production of the teddy bears in the original factory at the Ironbridge site, with Merrythought Ltd purely managing product development and sales. This was a short-lived partnership and Merrythought ended up bringing production back in-house in early 2010 and have since then continued to manage all elements of the business from Ironbridge, Shropshire. All Merrythought teddy bears are still 100% handmade in England.|$|E
2500|$|The first European importations of alpaca fiber {{were into}} Spain. Spain {{transferred}} that fiber to Germany and France. Apparently, alpaca yarn was spun in England {{for the first}} time about the year 1808, but the fiber was condemned as an unworkable material. In 1830, Benjamin Outram, of Greetland, near Halifax, appears to have reattempted spinning it, and again it was condemned. These two attempts failed due to the style of fabric into which the yarn was woven—a type of camlet. With the introduction of cotton warps into Bradford trade about 1836, the true qualities of alpaca could be assessed as it was developed into fabric. It is not known where the cotton warp and <b>mohair</b> or alpaca weft plain-cloth came from, but it was this simple and ingenious structure which enabled Titus Salt, then a young Bradford manufacturer, to use alpaca successfully. Bradford is still the great spinning and manufacturing center for alpaca. Large quantities of yarns and cloths are exported annually to the European continent and the US, although the quantities vary with the fashions in vogue. The typical [...] "alpaca fabric" [...] is a very characteristic [...] "dress fabric." ...|$|E

As for Marian and me, we did not much care whether we were married at <b>Mohair</b> or the City of Mexico. Mrs. Cooke, I think, had a secret preference for Germantown.|$|E
