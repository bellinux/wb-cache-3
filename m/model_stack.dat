40|$|Advanced {{characterization}} {{methods have been}} used to analyze the thermo-mechanical behaviour of solid oxide fuel cells in a <b>model</b> <b>stack.</b> The primarily experimental work included contacting studies, sealing of a <b>model</b> <b>stack,</b> thermal and re-oxidation cycling. Also an attempt was made to correlate cell fracture in the stack with pore sizes determined from computer tomography. The contacting studies were carried out using pressure sensitive foils. The load to achieve full contact on anode and cathode side of the cell was assessed and applied in the subsequent <b>model</b> <b>stack</b> test. The stack experiment permitted a detailed analysis of stack compaction during sealing. During steady state operation thermal and re-oxidation cycling the changes in open cell voltage and acoustic emissions were monitored. Significant softening of the sealant material was observed at low temperatures. Heating in the thermal cycling loop of the stack appeared to be less critical than the cooling. Re-oxidation cycling led to significant damage if a critical re-oxidation time was exceeded. Microstructural studies permitted further insight into the re-oxidation mechanism. Finally, the maximum defect size in the cell was determined by computer tomography. A limit of maximum anode stress was estimated and the result correlated this with the failure strength observed during the <b>model</b> <b>stack</b> testing. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

We investigate data concatenation (with fine tuning), <b>model</b> <b>stacking</b> (multi-level fine tuning), data selection and weighted ensemble. We evaluate these methods based on three criteria: i) translation quality, ii) training time, and iii) robustness towards out-of-domain tests. Our findings on Arabic-English and German-English language pairs show that the best translation quality {{can be achieved by}} building an initial system on a concatenation of available out-of-domain data and then fine-tuning it on in-domain data. <b>Model</b> <b>stacking</b> works best when training begins with the furthest out-of-domain data and the model is incrementally fine-tuned with the next furthest domain and so on. Data selection did not give the best results, but can be considered as a decent compromise between training time and translation quality. A weighted ensemble of different individual models performed better than data selection. It is beneficial in a scenario when there is no time for fine-tuning. Comment: 7 page...|$|R

The {{complexity of}} such systems is, however, challenging and many endeavors {{are limited in}} some respect: Some projects focus on a particular aspect like memory safety, not pursuing functional correctness. Others restrict their verification efforts to a single layer of software, assuming correctness of those below. Only few projects aim at pervasive formal verification of a computer system over several software layers. In our paper, we present an approach to the formal specification of a microkernel-based operating system at several layers and glance on our verification experience with this <b>model</b> <b>stack.</b> From our experience, we conclude that pervasiveness entails more than just cumulative verification efforts on several layers. In fact, it is a challenging task to integrate models and proofs into a uniform, coherent theory. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{workshop}} was {{the first}} U. S. DOE sponsored meeting devoted to fuel cell modeling. The workshop was attended by over 45 people from industry, universities, and the government. The goals of the meeting were to assess the status of fuel cell modeling, and determine how new developments in fuel cell modeling can improve cell design, stack design, and power system design. The primary focus was on cell and <b>stack</b> <b>modeling.</b> Following a review of DOE/NETL fuel cell related programs and activities, Professor Robert Selman (Illinois Institute of Technology) kicked off the technical portion of the workshop by presenting an overview of fuel cell phenomena {{and the status of}} fuel cell modeling. This overview provided the necessary background for establishing a common framework for discussing fuel cell modeling. A distinction was made between micro modeling, electrode <b>modeling,</b> cell <b>modeling,</b> <b>stack</b> <b>modeling,</b> and system modeling. It was proposed that all modeling levels be supported for further development. In addition, due to significant advances being made outside the U. S., it was proposed that dialog/exchange with other international researchers be established. Following the Overview Session, eight leading researchers in modeling gave individual presentations. These presentations provided additional information on the status and present direction of model developments. All these presentations can be found in Attachment A. Before the workshop, a survey was sent out requesting comments from the attendees. Results from this survey can be found in Attachment B.

To enhance the performance of the JVM, a stack operations folding mechanism for the picoJava-II processor was proposed by Sun Microsystems to fold 42. 3 % stack push/pop instructions. A systematic folding algorithm—Producer, Operator, and Consumer (POC) folding model was proposed in the earlier research to eliminate up to 82. 9 % of stack push/pop instructions. The remaining push and pop instructions cannot be folded due to the sequential checking characteristic of the POC folding model.

40|$|The {{difference}} in restricted mean survival times between two groups is a clinically relevant summary measure. With observational data, {{there may be}} imbalances in confounding variables between the two groups. One approach to account for such imbalances is to esti-mate a covariate-adjusted restricted mean difference by modeling the covariate-adjusted survival distribution and then marginalizing over the covariate distribution. We demonstrate that the mean-squared er-ror of the restricted mean difference is bounded by the mean-squared error of the covariate-adjusted survival distribution estimators. This implies that a better estimator of the covariate-adjusted survival dis-tributions {{is associated with a}} better estimator of the restricted mean difference.

40|$|A small {{cogeneration}} {{system based}} on a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) fed on the renewable energy source biogas is presented. An existing farm biogas production site (35 m 3 per day), currently equipped with a SOFC demonstration stack, is taken for reference. A process flow diagram was defined in a software package allowing to vary system operating parameters like the fuel inlet composition, reforming technology, stack temperature and stack current (or fuel conversion). For system reforming simplicity, a base case parameter set {{was defined as the}} fuel inlet of 60 % CH 4 : 40 % CO 2 mixed with air in a 1 : 1 ratio, together with 800 8 C operating temperature and 80 % fuel conversion.

The <b>model</b> <b>stack</b> consisted of planar anode supported cells operated at 800 degreesC displaying state-of- the-art electrochemical performance (0. 15 W/cm(2) at 80 % fuel utilisation). Real annual data from an existing sewage plant were used as input to the model. From the input of 43 m(3) /h biogas (63 % CH 4), equivalent to 269 kW (higher heating value, HHV), the SOFC stack was calculated to deliver 131 kW,l electricity (48. 7 %) using a steam-to-carbon ratio of 0. 5. This would allow the sewage site to more than cover its own electrical needs, hence to depollute the waste stream at negative energy cost. In its current exploitation using a low efficient gas engine (130 M), the site is only approximate to 50 % self- sufficient. Special attention {{was given to the}} thermal balance of the stack. The stack developed heat (143 kW) could be balanced by endothermal reforming (78 kW) and by cathode excess air lambda (= 3), allowing a temperature difference between stack inlet and outlet of 200 K.

Several uncertainties exist {{in regards to the}} mathematical modelling and simulationin global response analyses of drilling systems. In this thesis the uncertainties thatare related to the goodness of the representation of the blowout preventer stack (BOPstack), are addressed. An overview of previous and ongoing work on analytical estimation of wellhead fatigue isgiven. Relevant theory on the subject is presented and described. The theory comprisesof fatigue on structures, loads on a drilling system and static and dynamic responseanalysis. The main features of the preliminary analytical methods for estimating wellhead fatigue are summarized. The BOP stack is commonly assumed to have innitely high stiness when performinga global response analysis of a drilling system. The main objective in the thesis is toinvestigate if this is a good assumption. The investigation start with local modellingof an elastic beam element model of a BOP stack. Further, this elastic beam model iscalibrated to have the same stiness properties as a detailed 3 D element <b>model</b> of theBOP <b>stack.</b> The calibrated elastic beam BOP <b>stack</b> <b>model</b> is implemented in a globalmodel of a drilling system.
