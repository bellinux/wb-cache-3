5|$|The {{measurement}} of stellar parallax of nearby stars provides a fundamental baseline in the cosmic distance ladder {{that is used}} to measure the scale of the Universe. Parallax <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> nearby stars provide an absolute baseline for the properties of more distant stars, as their properties can be compared. <b>Measurements</b> <b>of</b> the radial velocity and proper motion of stars allows astronomers to plot the movement of these systems through the Milky Way galaxy. Astrometric results are the basis used to calculate the distribution of speculated dark matter in the galaxy.|$|E
5|$|The {{twentieth century}} saw {{increasingly}} rapid {{advances in the}} scientific study of stars. The photograph became a valuable astronomical tool. Karl Schwarzschild discovered that the color of a star and, hence, its temperature, could be determined by comparing the visual magnitude against the photographic magnitude. The development of the photoelectric photometer allowed precise <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> magnitude at multiple wavelength intervals. In 1921 Albert A. Michelson made the first <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> a stellar diameter using an interferometer on the Hooker telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory.|$|E
