50|$|Ed Hujsak, {{assistant}} chief engineer of <b>mechanical</b> and <b>propulsion</b> {{systems for the}} Atlas program, believed that {{the location of the}} propellant lines on the E/F missiles was causing LOX and RP-1 ejected from the spent booster engines following staging to mix and explode, possibly damaging valves or plumbing. As evidence of this, he pointed to telemetry data from flights indicating a momentary pitching motion of the missile after booster jettison, which could be the result of the energy generated by exploding propellant. The conclusion was that such an event had ruptured low pressure ducting on Missile 26E and caused loss of fuel flow to the sustainer gas generator, or else propellant residue had obstructed the ducting. Hujsak proposed that additional cutoff valves be added to the propellant lines in the booster engines that would be closed just before jettison. This upgrade had to be retrofitted to missiles that had already been shipped, but Air Force officials argued that they only needed to add valves to the LOX lines {{on the grounds that the}} RP-1 could not detonate without oxidizer.|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that a higher intra-individual variability benefits the motor learning of wheelchair propulsion. The present study evaluated whether feedback-induced variability on wheelchair propulsion technique variables would also enhance the motor learning process. Learning was operationalized as an improvement in <b>mechanical</b> efficiency and <b>propulsion</b> technique, which are thought to be closely related during the learning process. 17 Participants received visual feedback-based practice (feedback group) and 15 participants received regular practice (natural learning group). Both groups received equal practice dose of 80 min, over 3 weeks, at 0. 24 W/kg at a treadmill speed of 1. 11 m/s. To compare both groups the pre- and post-test were performed without feedback. The feedback group received real-time visual feedback on seven propulsion variables with instruction to manipulate the presented variable to achieve the highest possible variability (1 st 4 -min block) and optimize it in the prescribed direction (2 nd 4 -min block). To increase motor exploration the participants were unaware of the exact variable they received feedback on. Energy consumption and the propulsion technique variables with their respective coefficient of variation were calculated to evaluate the amount of intra-individual variability. The feedback group, which practiced with higher intra-individual variability, improved the propulsion technique between pre- and post-test to the same extent as the natural learning group. Mechanical efficiency improved between pre- and post-test in the natural learning group but remained unchanged in the feedback group. These results suggest that feedback-induced variability inhibited the improvement in mechanical efficiency. Moreover, since both groups improved propulsion technique but only the natural learning group improved mechanical efficiency, it can be concluded that the improvement in <b>mechanical</b> efficiency and <b>propulsion</b> technique do not always appear simultaneously during the motor learning process. Their relationship is most likely modified by other factors such as the amount of the intra-individual variability...|$|R

40|$|Now {{that the}} {{viability}} of the Pegasus air launched booster has been demonstrated, it is possible, and indeed appropriate, to devise methods for exploiting the launcher so that it can launch multiple micro-satellites. Such spacecraft may be launched for a single user, or the capacity of a single launcher may be divided among multiple users. In fact, not all of the satellites on a single launch need to be placed into the same orbit.

If a constellation of communications satellites are deployed by this approach, global coverage can be provided at what is believed to be the lowest cast available today.

DCZEDS requires a device that provides galvanic isolation between the feeder buses and the zones to prevent fault propagation between zones. For DCZEDS to be practical, DC-DC converters that provide galvanic isolation with an efficiency and reliability approaching that of existing low frequency AC isolation transformers must be placed between the feeder buses and the zones. This thesis examines the construction and operation of a prototype galvanically isolated DC-DC converter using commercial-off-the-shelf parts. The converter uses a single-phase high-frequency transformer link to provide galvanic isolation. This work shows that this converter topology is reliable enough to be used in an IPS.

40|$|The more-electric {{trend is}} there in almost all {{the corners of the}} {{automotive}} industry. The same trend is followed by the maritime transportation industry as well and as a result, conventional <b>mechanical</b> transmission based <b>propulsion</b> systems are gradually being overtaken by electric power transmission based propulsion systems. An azimuth thruster driven by an electric motor is a common configuration found in modern electric propulsion systems. Due to the tight speed control and stiff drivetrain in these propulsion systems load transients easily get propagated into the dc-link of the motor drive and subsequently into the upstream power bus as well. These transients can cause disturbances to the other loads connected to the power system. In the worst case, stability of the shipboard power system gets affected by the transients. This paper proposes to use the capacitor-clamped inverter based motor drive itself to absorb such transients and thereby prevent the propagation into the power bus. The efficacy of the proposed concept is verified through computer simulations. Simulation results show that the capacitor-clamped inverter is capable of absorbing load transients without passing them to the upstream power bus...|$|R

Ship {{maneuvering}} {{model and}} ocean scene are the core parts of navigation simulator, {{on the basis}} of MMG’s model, the dual-engine and dual-propelling equipment of the Z-propeller tug were researched, the tug’s <b>mechanical</b> model and <b>propulsion</b> model were established, speed, course and path of the tug were calculated with the Runge-Kutta method; virtual ocean was built at the meantime based on waves statistic spectrum and fast fourier transform; at last, data communication between different softwares was realized by means of UDP and ADO protocol, and virtual marine navigation system was established based on the Z-propeller tug’s maneuvering model. Preface In recent years，with the development of economy, increasing of trade contacts across the world, the ship as the major mean of transportation has became unprecedented important. As shipping industry’s prosperity and port shoreline’s extension, there is an urgent demand for Z-propeller tugs to accomplish port tasks. Operation of the Z-propeller tug is different from other common ships, its working area is restricted in the harbor district, so people attach less importance to its maneuvering characteristics. For unfamiliar tug mariners, a real-time and reliable navigation simulator can guarantee efficiency and safety of the tug as well as supply technical support for port operations...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to analyse the economic efficiency of mechanised fishing in Chennai in Tamil Nadu along the east coast of India. The craft and gear combinations over the years witnessed dramatic changes on account of the huge cost of fishing, duration and depth of operations and maintenance. The mechanised gillnetters showed tremendous increase among the fishing fleet in Chennai mainly due to their assured returns and consistent marketing margin. The present study specifically compares the economic efficiency of mechanised gillnet units and trawlers operating from Chennai. Average operating cost and net income per day for the multiday (MD) gillnetters were ` 17, 757 and 6, 613 whereas in the case of multiday trawlers, the operating cost and net income per day were ` 18, 095 and ` 3, 219, respectively. Targeted tuna fishing and better price realisation in the value chain have contributed to better performance of gillnet units. The higher fuel requirement observed for MD trawlers as compared to MD gillnetters is attributed to long distance travelling and the use of <b>mechanical</b> power for <b>propulsion</b> as well as for fishing.

40|$|To {{gain insight}} into cyclic motor {{learning}} processes, hand rim wheelchair propulsion is a suitable cyclic task, to be learned during early rehabilitation and novel to almost every individual. To propel in an energy efficient manner, wheelchair users must learn to control bimanually applied forces onto the rims, preserving both speed and direction of locomotion. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate <b>mechanical</b> efficiency and <b>propulsion</b> technique during the initial stage of motor learning. Therefore, 70 naive able-bodied men received 12 -min uninstructed wheelchair practice, consisting of three 4 -min blocks separated by 2 min rest. Practice was performed on a motor-driven treadmill at a fixed belt speed and constant power output relative to body mass. Energy consumption and the kinetics of propulsion technique were continuously measured. Participants significantly increased their mechanical efficiency and changed their propulsion technique from a high frequency mode with a lot of negative work to a longer-slower movement pattern with less power losses. Furthermore a multi-level model showed propulsion technique to relate to mechanical efficiency. Finally improvers and non-improvers were identified. The non-improving group was already more efficient and had a better propulsion technique in the first block of practice (i. e., the fourth minute). These findings link <b>propulsion</b> technique to <b>mechanical</b> efficiency, support the importance of a correct propulsion technique for wheelchair users and show motor learning differences. © 2001 - 2011 IEEE...|$|R
