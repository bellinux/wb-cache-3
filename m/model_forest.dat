2500|$|Criteria and {{indicators}} of {{sustainable forest management}} are widely used and many countries produce national reports that assess their progress toward sustainable forest management. [...] There are nine international and regional criteria and indicators initiatives, which collectively involve more than 150 countries. Three of the more advanced initiatives {{are those of the}} Working Group on Criteria and Indicators for the Conservation and Sustainable Management of Temperate and Boreal Forests (also called the Montreal Process), Forest Europe, and the International Tropical Timber Organization. Countries who are members of the same initiative usually agree to produce reports {{at the same time and}} using the same indicators. Within countries, at the management unit level, efforts have also been directed at developing local level criteria and {{indicators of}} sustainable forest management. The Center for International Forestry Research, the International <b>Model</b> <b>Forest</b> Network and researchers at the University of British Columbia have developed a number of tools and techniques to help forest-dependent communities develop their own local level criteria and indicators. Criteria and Indicators also form the basis of third-party forest certification programs such as the Canadian Standards Association's Sustainable Forest Management Standards and the Sustainable Forestry Initiative Standard.|$|E
