2500|$|CNBC {{correspondent}} Jane Wells {{reported that}} the Occupy Wall Street movement sparked parodies which connect the movement to pop culture icons from Star Wars and Lord of the Rings and others. An image of Luke Skywalker holding a protest sign was published: [...] "It wasn't glamorous but I had a steady living working on my uncle's moisture farm... <b>my</b> <b>aunt</b> <b>and</b> uncle were unjustly murdered and the farm destroyed. I {{was forced to leave}} my home and join an extinct cult just to survive. I am now a member of an upstart movement to take down a greedy corrupt establishment. I AM THE 99%." [...] Skywalker's enemies, the Imperial Storm Troopers, joined the protest on another image circulating on the Internet holding signs: [...] "End Galactic Corporate Greed", [...] "Get Our Troops Off Tatooine" [...] and [...] "Keep Your Empirical Hands Off My Healthcare". Parodies relating to Middle Earth include a woman who had written her complaint in Elvish, allegedly translated: [...] "I spend every waking hour fighting Orcs while Elrond and Galadriel eat lembas bread all day. I am the 99%." ...|$|E

60|$|The next day, I {{wrote to}} <b>my</b> <b>aunt,</b> <b>and</b> also to Fritz, knowing how anxious {{he must be}} to hear from me.|$|E
5000|$|... “I {{really enjoyed}} {{learning}} about Rozzano Jr., {{getting to know}} him and introducing him to the family as well, {{because a lot of}} <b>my</b> <b>aunts</b> <b>and</b> uncles and cousins didn’t know him,” Palmer said. “This gives him a marker that says, ‘I lived and I was important'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'MY DEAR UNCLE,--My conduct {{has been}} unjustifiable--I feel it. Do not visit it on Laura--I alone should suffer. I entreat your pardon, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>aunt's,</b> <b>and</b> leave all to you. I will write more at length. Be kind to her.--Yours affectionately, ...|$|R
60|$|Pretty women I {{had seen}} in plenty, for <b>my</b> <b>aunts</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> mother were counted fair, but my uncle's wife was as little like to them as a sunset glow to pale moonshine or a crimson rose to white day-lilies.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not till Mr. Ponderevo comes, Meggie," [...] said <b>my</b> <b>aunt,</b> <b>and</b> grimaced with {{extraordinary}} swiftness and virulence as the housemaid turned her back.|$|E
60|$|Grosse {{took off}} his hat sulkily to <b>my</b> <b>aunt,</b> <b>and</b> looked back again at me--looked so hard and so long, that he began to confuse me.|$|E
60|$|ANTHONY. I {{have but}} just alighted. I had but one thought, sir: {{to pay my}} respects to Mr. Austin. I have not yet kissed <b>my</b> <b>aunt</b> <b>and</b> sister.|$|E
3000|$|Our {{family is}} a big family, we live very close to <b>my</b> uncles, <b>aunts,</b> <b>and</b> {{maternal}} grandparents. We often hold family meeting. That day, all the family members sat together and vote for the approval. It turns out half half. My dad kept silence during the whole meeting, did not say a thing. My maternal grandmother, <b>my</b> <b>aunts,</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> mom, they trusted me, and supported me. My uncles are conservative Chinese middle age men, {{and they think that}} it seems inappropriate for a Chinese girl to find a foreign boyfriend. (Gabrielle) [...]...|$|R

6000|$|... "But <b>my</b> <b>aunt</b> <b>and</b> myself {{desire to}} quit the brig, and if the {{stranger}} should prove to be an American vessel of war, might not the occasion be favourable?" ...|$|E
60|$|I echoed it, parted from <b>my</b> <b>aunt,</b> <b>and</b> went lightly downstairs, mounted, {{and rode}} away. There was greater reason than before {{to do what}} I had {{resolved}} to do.|$|E
60|$|It was {{fortunate}} he had proceeded so far with his mystery, for {{we heard the}} coach stop at the little garden gate, which brought <b>my</b> <b>aunt</b> <b>and</b> Dora home.|$|E
60|$|We {{began to}} talk about <b>my</b> <b>aunt's</b> losses, <b>and</b> I told them what I had tried to do that morning.|$|R
6000|$|By and by, {{when that}} was finished, he came upon Kolokolo Bird {{sitting in the middle}} of a wait-a-bit thorn-bush, and he said, 'My father has spanked me, and my mother has spanked me; all <b>my</b> <b>aunts</b> <b>and</b> uncles have spanked me for my 'satiable curtiosity; and still I want to know what the Crocodile has for dinner!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You have {{actually}} penetrated the convent, <b>and</b> seen <b>my</b> <b>aunt?</b> Impossible! <b>and</b> yet this pencilled note is her own dear writing!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I'll {{give you}} {{ten minutes to}} write your letter; it can't {{possibly}} take you more, not even if you put into it my love to <b>my</b> <b>aunt</b> <b>and</b> cousins." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{these words}} Gus began to shed tears. I {{could not help}} but feel sorry for him, and also for <b>my</b> <b>aunt</b> <b>and</b> my cousin Lillian when they should hear the news.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not unless I {{walked in}} my sleep," [...] she answered, [...] "but {{you had better}} make {{enquiries}} of <b>my</b> <b>aunt,</b> <b>and</b> Parkins, our maid. They sleep one {{on either side of}} me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Begin it, 'Respected Madam,'" [...] he said. [...] "Ma has {{a letter}} a school trustee once writ to <b>my</b> <b>Aunt</b> Jane <b>and</b> that's how it begins." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{informed}} him of <b>my</b> <b>aunt's</b> project; <b>and</b> I added that Madame Fontaine had not positively said No. He listened without conviction, frowning and shaking his head.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Little Mrs. Propriety,' said Jane, 'you {{are already}} {{assuming}} all {{the dignity of}} <b>my</b> <b>Aunt</b> Marianne, <b>and</b> William's <b>Aunt</b> Marianne--oh! <b>and</b> of little Henry's Great-aunt Marianne. Now,' she added, laughing, 'can you guess the secret?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite comfortably--if {{he would}} have been my brother too." [...] Oscar pointed to the house in which <b>my</b> <b>aunt</b> <b>and</b> I are living--within a few yards of the place on which we stood.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thank you, my dear,' said Lady Martindale, as if much tempted. 'I {{am afraid}} not, {{it might be}} too much for <b>my</b> <b>aunt.</b> <b>And</b> yet, I should have liked to see the little girl.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{wrote the}} {{wonderful}} Sinn Fein play, 'The New Green,' didn't he?" [...] Katharine asked eagerly. [...] "I heard {{you mention it}} to him. <b>My</b> <b>aunt</b> <b>and</b> I were there at the first night." ...|$|E
60|$|But <b>my</b> <b>aunts</b> <b>and</b> their {{stepmother}} talked much of Alicia, {{and they}} spoke slightingly of her, {{saying that she}} was but a light woman and that no good would come of my Uncle Hugh's having wed her, with other things of a like nature. Also they spoke of the company she gathered around her, thinking her to have strange and unbecoming companions for a Montressor. All this I heard and pondered much over, although <b>my</b> good <b>aunts</b> supposed that such a chit as I would take no heed to their whisperings.|$|R
6000|$|It was Sunday <b>and</b> all <b>my</b> <b>aunts</b> <b>and</b> uncles were in holiday {{dress and}} a merry, hearty, {{handsome}} group they were. One of the men helped my mother out and another, a roguish young fellow with a pock-marked face, snatched me from the wagon and carried me under his arm to the threshold where a short, gray-haired smiling woman was standing. [...] "Mother, here's another grandson for you," [...] {{he said as he}} put me at her feet.|$|R
60|$|We {{had a long}} chat by {{the fire}} {{before we went to}} bed. I slept in a room on the same floor with <b>my</b> <b>aunt's,</b> <b>and</b> was a little {{disturbed}} {{in the course of the}} night by her knocking at my door as often as she was agitated by a distant sound of hackney-coaches or market-carts, and inquiring, 'if I heard the engines?' But towards morning she slept better, and suffered me to do so too.|$|R
60|$|He {{was more}} {{affected}} by this act of kindness, than I had ever seen him affected by anything since the night she went away. <b>My</b> <b>aunt</b> <b>and</b> I {{did not attempt to}} disturb him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I will. Perhaps {{that is what}} I {{was sent}} here for. I will ask her of <b>my</b> <b>aunt,</b> <b>and</b> I think she will let me have her. You will keep her secret, Anne." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{acknowledgement}} of this question, addressed {{to him with}} extraordinary curtness, Mr. Heep, uncomfortably clutching the blue bag he carried, replied that he was pretty well, he thanked <b>my</b> <b>aunt,</b> <b>and</b> hoped she was the same.|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>Aunt</b> Martha gasped, <b>and</b> {{looked as}} if she were going to sit down on the floor.|$|R
