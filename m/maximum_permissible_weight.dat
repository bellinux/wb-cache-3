50|$|The {{aircraft}}'s Certificate of Airworthiness {{had last}} been renewed in November 1928 and was valid for a year. Its <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> <b>weight</b> was 2946 lb, the aircraft weight was 2494 lb on departure from Croydon.

The fourth surviving passenger was not called as she was legally a minor at the time and had lost her father in the accident. The inquiry closed on 3 July. Imperial Airways and Napier, the engine manufacturer, were cleared of any blame for the accident. The report into the investigation was published on 12 July. Amongst the recommendations were that passengers should be provided with seatbelts and that aircraft not capable of maintaining level flight with an inoperative engine and not designed to land on water should be withdrawn from continental routes after 1 July 1930.|$|E

50|$|The e-vignette {{user charge}} system applies to motorcycles, {{passenger}} cars and their trailers, {{as well as}} cargo vehicles with a <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> gross <b>weight</b> of 3.5 tonnes, campers and buses, and their trailers. These vehicles are authorized to use the Hungarian toll speedway network’s roads exclusively with pre-purchased -purchased prior to entering a toll speedway section- road use authorization, i.e. e-vignettes. The amount of toll charges depends on the category of the vehicle {{and the type of}} thee-vignette.

50|$|With the {{introduction}} of the toll-collection system with stickers {{in the second half of}} 2008, only half-year stickers were sold, and annual stickers for 2009 were made available at the beginning of December 2008.

50|$|In aviation, {{clearway}} {{is a term}} {{related to}} the dimension of some runways and it is abbreviated with CWY. Clearway is an area beyond the paved runway, free of obstructions and {{under the control of}} the airport authorities. The length of the clearway may be included in the length of the takeoff distance available. For example, if a paved runway is 2000 m long and there are 400 m of clearway beyond the end of the runway, the takeoff distance available is 2400 m long. When the runway is to be used for takeoff of a large airplane, the <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> takeoff <b>weight</b> of the airplane can be based on the takeoff distance available, including clearway. Clearway allows large airplanes to take off at a heavier weight than would be allowed if only the length of the paved runway is taken into account.|$|R

The sticker costs are €15 for 7 days, €30 {{for a month and}} €95 for a year. Motorcyclists have to pay €7.50 for 7 days, €25 for a half year and €47.50 for a year. Trucks use existing toll road stops. Use of highways and expressways without a valid and properly displayed sticker in a vehicle is a violation of the law and is punished with a fine of €300 or more.|$|R
25|$|Compared {{to other}} cargo {{aircraft}} then coming into service, the C-76 was already obsolescent, even allowing for its war-priority method of construction. In addition, the C-76 failed {{a number of}} critical flight tests. It was discovered in testing that the C-76 was unstable when not carrying a cargo load; {{in order to obtain}} a stable center of gravity, the plane had to be ballasted beyond its <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> gross takeoff <b>weight.</b> At any speed, or in any gusting wind, the C-76's elevators would flap back and forth violently. The wing structure failed in eight separate static tests, sometimes with a load as low as 40% of the wing's rated capacity. The wing failures were attributed by some sources to the failure of the fasteners used to secure the wood components of the aircraft. Numerous additional fasteners, metal stirrups, and wood ply reinforcements were added to the structure in an effort to strengthen it, thereby increasing the plane's overall weight.|$|R
40|$|Traffic {{accidents}} involving heavy trucks have {{social and economic}} effects on society. However, little {{research has focused on}} the influence of heavy truck specifications such as <b>weight.</b> Apportioning the <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> gross <b>weight</b> of trucks allows trucking companies/owners to consolidate loads, and therefore reduce the vehicle-kilometres required to collect and distribute a given amount of goods/material. While drivers/managers are responsible for ensuring that trucks are loaded appropriately and in compliance with regulations, some may take chances and overload vehicles. This increases the need for formal and documented inspections, in order to reduce traffic hazards on public roads due to overweight loading. According to a New South Wales Centre for Road Safety report in 2014, crashes involving heavy trucks often result in serious road trauma outcomes. When a heavy truck is involved in a crash, the vehicle mass raises the crash forces involved and hence increases the severity of the crash. Therefore, interventions should be established to mitigate or prevent these crashes from occurring. Currently, weight checks are required for trucks and truck drivers must drive to a weighbridge for a weight check. Since this is a random process, truck drivers may take the risk of driving an over-loaded truck on some occasions. This paper reviews existing studies concerning safe system interventions in relation to truck gross weight management and a framework is presented to effectively manage truck loading weight. The result may be a reduction of injuries and fatalities involving heavy trucks...|$|R

40|$|Extending {{the life}} of the HFIR {{pressure}} vessel from 26 to 50 EFPY (100 MW) requires an updated calculation of the <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> pressure for a range in vessel operating temperatures (40 - 120 F). The <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> pressure is calculated using the equal-potential method, which takes advantage of knowledge gained from periodic hydrostatic proof tests and uses the test conditions (pressure, temperature, and frequency) as input. The <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> pressure decreases with increasing time between hydro tests but is increased each time a test is conducted. The minimum values that occur just prior to a test either increase or decrease with time, depending on the vessel temperature. The minimum value of these minimums is presently specified as the <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> pressure. For three vessel temperatures of particular interest (80, 88, and 110 F) and a nominal time of 3. 0 EFPY(100 MVV) between hydro tests, these pressures are 677, 753, and 850 psi.

40|$|In this work, a {{reliability}} analysis of an aeronautical armor is proposed, using stochastic optimization techniques. The {{reliability of the}} armor can be assessed by evaluating several types of failures when the armor is hit by a projectile. The possible armor failures include projectile penetration, excessive displacement, excessive deformation, non-absorption of the projectile energy by the structure, etc. Also, the armor should be designed {{in order to avoid}} any conflict with aircraft design restrictions, such as the maximum allowed weight and the aircraft centroid position. Stochastic optimization refers to the minimization or maximization of an objective function in the presence of randomness. Uncertainties can occur in the projectile parameters, such as its mass, velocity, angle of incidence, and also in the armor parameters, such as its material and geometric parameters. Also, there is some uncertainty in the armor boundary conditions, depending on the way the armor is installed in the aircraft structure. The optimization procedure includes several constraint equations, such as, kinetic energy and <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> deformation, <b>maximum</b> <b>weight</b> and <b>permissible</b> displacement for the aircraft centroid. Some of these constraint equations are obtained through regression of data obtained from numerical simulation. ANSYS/LS-DYNA ® is used for the numerical simulation. This simulation is carried out using a specially designed, existing code for non-linear transient dynamic events, such as ballistic impacts. To simplify the aircraft armor analysis, the protected area is divided into a mesh, consisting of a set of rectangular plates, and only the impact in one plate is considered. In this work, the armor is made of two thin layers. The first layer is made of a ceramic material while the second layer i...|$|R
