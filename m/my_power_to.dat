25|$|I {{am doing}} {{everything}} in <b>my</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> discourage {{the use of}} gases and other chemicals in any war between nations. While, unfortunately, the defensive necessities of the United States call for study {{of the use of}} chemicals in warfare, I do not want the Government of the United States to do anything to aggrandize or make permanent any special bureau of the Army or the Navy engaged in these studies. I hope the time will come when the Chemical Warfare Service can be entirely abolished.|$|E
25|$|Looking at {{that picture}} today makes me cringe. It {{was done in}} the worst {{possible}} taste. Back then I was too immature to see that. Shame on me—I should have done everything in <b>my</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> stop it. The record company came up with the idea, I think. The lyrics incidentally were a take-off on Kiss, whom we had just supported on a tour. I was fooling around and played the riff of the song in the rehearsal room and spontaneously improvised 'cause he's a virgin killer!' trying to do a more or less way-off-the-mark Paul Stanley impersonation. Klaus immediately said 'that's great! You should do something with it.' Then I had the unenviable task of constructing a meaningful set of lyrics around the title, which I actually managed to do to some degree. But the song has a totally different meaning from what people would assume at first. Virgin Killer is none other than the demon of our time, the less compassionate side of the societies we live in today—brutally trampling upon {{the heart and soul of}} innocence.|$|E

25|$|I {{will say}} {{to you and to}} the colored race that men who bore arms and {{followed}} the flag of the Confederacy are, with very few exceptions, your friends. I have an opportunity of saying what I have always felt – that I am your friend, for my interests are your interests, and your interests are my interests. We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, and live in the same land. Why, then, can we not live as brothers? I will say that when the war broke out I felt it my duty to stand by my people. When the time came I did the best I could, and I don't believe I flickered. I came here with the jeers of some white people, who think that I am doing wrong. I believe that I can exert some influence, and do much to assist the people in strengthening fraternal relations, and shall do all in <b>my</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> bring about peace. It has always been my motto to elevate every man- to depress none. (Applause.) I want to elevate you to take positions in law offices, in stores, on farms, and wherever you are capable of going.|$|E
500|$|At his {{confirmation}} hearings in 2017, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch recalled being moved by reading Sumner's gravestone {{as a law}} student at Harvard. Gorsuch closed his opening statement by reading a portion of Sumner's epitaph and adding [...] "hose words stick with me. I keep them on my desk. They serve {{for me as a}} daily reminder of the law's integrity, that a useful life can be led in its service, of the hard work it takes, and an encouragement to good habits when I fail and when I falter. At the end of it all, I can ask for nothing more than to be described as he was. And if confirmed, I pledge to you that I will do everything in <b>my</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> be that man." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{basis for}} this order of battle is a return {{prepared}} by General Washington on August 3. [...] It encompasses all of the units stationed in the New York area, not only {{those involved in the}} battle. [...] The total provided is a listing of all troops, not just those listed as ready for duty. [...] A substantial number of troops were sick during July and August. [...] For example, General William Heath, writing in his memoirs, recorded that about 10,000 men were sick on August 8, and Washington reported on September 2 having fewer than 20,000 men present and fit for duty. [...] Later returns were apparently impossible: Washington wrote to Congress on August 26 that [...] "he shifting and changing which the regiments have undergone of late has prevented their making proper returns, and of course puts it out of <b>my</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> transmit a general one of the army." ...|$|E

500|$|During the June 1964 National Governors' Conference, 13 of 16 Republican {{governors}} present {{were opposed}} to Goldwater; their leaders were Jim Rhodes of Ohio, Nelson Rockefeller of New York (whose own campaign had just stalled out with a loss to Goldwater in the California primary), William Scranton of Pennsylvania, and Romney. [...] In an unusual Sunday press conference, Romney declared, [...] "If [...] views deviate as indicated from the heritage of our party, I will do everything within <b>my</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> keep him from becoming the party's presidential nominee." [...] Romney had, however, previously vowed to Michigan voters {{that he would not}} run for president in 1964. [...] Detroit newspapers indicated they would not support him in any such bid, and Romney quickly decided to honor his pledge {{to stay out of the}} contest. [...] Scranton entered instead, but Goldwater prevailed decisively at the 1964 Republican National Convention. [...] Romney's name was entered into nomination as a favorite son by U.S. Representative Gerald Ford of Michigan (who had not wanted to choose between candidates during the primary campaign) and he received the votes of 41delegates in the roll call (40 of Michigan's 48 and one from Kansas).|$|E
500|$|Peel (presumably one of {{the liberal}} proprietors with {{excellent}} regulations who assured his support) introduced his Bill in 1802. [...] In doing so Peel {{said that he was}} convinced of the existence of gross mismanagement in his own factories, and having no time to set them in order himself, was getting an Act of Parliament passed to do it for him [...] but (given his dealings with the Manchester Board of Health) this may well have been a pleasantry, rather than the whole truth[...] [...] In 1816 Peel introduced a further Factory Bill; his explanation to the consequent Select Committee of the need for further legislation included this account of the origins of the 1802 Act: The house in which I have a concern gave employment at one time to near one thousand children of this description. [...] Having other pursuits, it was not often in <b>my</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> visit the factories, but whenever such visits were made, I was struck with the uniform appearance of bad health, and, in many cases, stinted growth of the children; the hours of labour were regulated by the interest of the overseer, whose remuneration depending on the quantity of the work done, he was often induced to make the poor children work excessive hours, and to stop their complaints by trifling bribes ...|$|E
500|$|Williams {{declared}} {{his intention to}} stand for election on 15 May 1860, one day after Müller. In his written submission to Convocation, he emphasised his suitability for appointment {{in the light of}} Boden's missionary wishes. After giving details of his life and career, particularly his experience in Sanskrit obtained at Haileybury, he stated that for the past 14 years [...] "the one idea of my life has been to make myself thoroughly conversant with Sanskrit, and by every means in <b>my</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> facilitate the study of its literature." [...] He assured voters that, if elected, [...] "my utmost energies shall be devoted to the one object which its Founder had in view;—namely The promotion of a more general and critical knowledge of the Sanskrit language, as a means of enabling Englishmen to proceed in the conversion of the natives of India to the Christian religion. Unlike Müller, he regarded the study of Sanskrit [...] "as chiefly a means to the missionary conversion of the Hindus rather than as an end in itself", as Dowling puts it. In this way, Dowling says, he could attempt to deflect attention from his [...] "modest abilities in classical Sanskrit" [...] when compared to Müller's [...] "internationally acknowledged achievements". Moreover, the appeal to Boden's original intentions came during a period when Convocation tended to pay little attention to the expressed wishes of benefactors.|$|E

2500|$|All {{during this}} time, there {{continued}} to be correspondence with Governor Haldimand in Quebec, particularly by Ethan Allen. [...] In June he wrote to Haldimand, [...] "I shall do everything in <b>my</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> render this state a British province", and made additional scathing commentary on the Congress. [...] However, the ongoing peace negotiations to end the revolutionary war {{put a damper on}} the communications, which finally ended in late 1783.|$|E

2500|$|This mentality {{carries over}} into practice. Peer {{recognition}} {{goes to the}} most thorough and aggressive physicians. The prudent physician is not deemed particularly competent, but rather inadequate. This culture is further reinforced by a unique understanding of professional obligations, specifically, the Hippocratic Oath's admonition to [...] "use <b>my</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> help the sick {{to the best of}} my ability and judgment" [...] as an imperative to do everything for the patient regardless of cost or effect on others.|$|E

Here I was starting on one of the maddest ventures that was ever undertaken by man. I needn't put its points again, but that which appealed to me most at the moment was the crocodiles. I have always hated crocodiles since--well, never mind--and the place was as full of them as the ponds at Ascension are of turtles.|$|R

2500|$|A {{class in}} which Ludlow always got the highest marks was one taught by famed Union College {{president}} Eliphalet Nott based on Lord Kames’ seminal 1762 literary work, Elements of Criticism – although it essentially became {{a course on}} Nott's own philosophy.

2500|$|Later in {{the morning}} of July 7, Governor Dayton {{appeared}} outside his residence and said: Dayton said he had requested an independent U.S. Department of Justice investigation and had spoken to White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough about the matter.
