After his death, Vice President Fillmore {{assumed the}} {{presidency}} and completed Taylor's term, which ended on March 4, 1853. Soon after taking office, Fillmore signed into law the Compromise of 1850, which settled <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> faced by the Taylor administration.|$|E

Constraint satisfaction problems, which generalize graph homomorphism problems, can express various additional types of conditions (such as individual preferences, or bounds on the number of coinciding assignments). This allows the models to be made more realistic and practical.|$|E
5|$|Backbreaker {{received}} mixed reviews. While it {{was praised}} for the Euphoria animation system, realistic physical gameplay, and the logo editor, it {{was criticized for}} its weak online play, poor passing game, and lack of depth in single-player modes. The Xbox 360 version of the game received an overall rating of 54% from review aggregator Metacritic, while the PlayStation 3 version received a 58%. The iOS and Android version was given a rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars by Touch Arcade. A patch released on August 6, 2010, alleviated <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> critics had with the game upon release and included upgrades such as improved AI, new play books and an enhanced replay feature.|$|E

5|$|In 1945, Thurman {{attended}} the San Francisco Conference for {{the founding of}} the United Nations as part of an unofficial delegation. The official African-American delegation included W. E. B. Du Bois, founder of the NAACP; Walter Francis White, Executive Secretary of the NAACP; and Mary McLeod Bethune founder of the National Council of Negro Women, but Bethune insisted on sending three additional observers from the NCNW, which included Thurman. After the event, Thurman published a report in the Chicago Defender on April 16, 1945, in which she questioned the limited role that people of color played in the proceedings and pointed out that the large populations of developing countries would become {{a force to be reckoned}} with. Thurman, as a representative for the NCNW, {{attended the}} Primer Congreso Interamericano de Mujeres held in Guatemala City, Guatemala, in 1947. The congress addressed <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> she supported such as women's rights, internationalism, and peace initiatives. In 1949, she led a delegation of members from the Church for the Fellowship of All Peoples to Paris for the Fourth Plenary Session of UNESCO.|$|E
5|$|Square Enix {{released}} a Microsoft Windows port {{of the game}} in October 2014, where it was met with a more critical reception than the original versions. PC Gamers Samuel Roberts, when reviewing the port, criticized not only the original gameplay, but heavily criticized the quality of the port itself, decrying the low resolution, limited graphical options and low framerate. He was especially critical of the time taken for the port given that an unofficial patch was produced by modder Peter Thoman within a day of release that fixed <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues.</b> Michael McWhertor of Polygon also noted a similar critical response by consumers. A patch was released by Square Enix in December 2014, which was noted by Thoman as adding only the graphical features that his external patch had, with no other additions or performance improvements.|$|E
5|$|Women {{experience}} many unique {{health issues}} related to reproduction and sexuality and these are responsible for {{a third of all}} health problems experienced by women during their reproductive years (aged 15–44), of which unsafe sex is a major risk factor, especially in developing countries. Reproductive health includes {{a wide range of issues}} including the health and function of structures and systems involved in reproduction, pregnancy, childbirth and child rearing, including antenatal and perinatal care. Global women's health has a much larger focus on reproductive health than that of developed countries alone, but also infectious diseases such as malaria in pregnancy and non-communicable diseases (NCD). <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> that face women and girls in resource poor regions are relatively unknown in developed countries, such as female genital cutting, and further lack access to the appropriate diagnostic and clinical resources.|$|E

25|$|The Can of Worms is {{the local}} name for the {{intersection}} of Interstate490 (I-490), I-590, New York State Route590 (NY590), NY96 (East Avenue), and University Avenue {{on the east side}} of Rochester, New York, in the United States. The junction was built during the 1950s and 1960s as part of the Rochester Outer Loop's construction, and rebuilt in the late 1980s to eliminate weaving caused by the interchange's original design. Although the reconstruction eliminated <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues,</b> the Can of Worms name stuck and is still used locally.|$|E

Their woes were heard in a Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations hearing which was chaired by Senator Levin, who said that he intends to keep the spotlight on credit card companies and that legislative action may be necessary to purge the industry.

25|$|Besides these {{thirteen}} colonies, Britain {{had another}} dozen in the New World. Those in the British West Indies, Newfoundland, the Province of Quebec, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Bermuda, and East and West Florida remained {{loyal to the}} crown throughout the war (although Spain reacquired Florida before the war was over). There was {{a certain degree of}} sympathy with the Patriot cause in several of the other colonies, but their geographical isolation and the dominance of British naval power precluded any effective participation. The British crown had only recently acquired those lands, and <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> facing the Thirteen Colonies did not apply to them, {{especially in the case of}} Quebec and Florida.|$|E
25|$|An RSC is {{composed}} of the regional committee members (RCMs) of all the participating ASCs in a region. It is similar in organization to an ASC, but is further removed from the day-to-day activities of individual home groups. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> dealt with by RSCs are the same ones that will come before the World Service Conference, with the RSC being {{the best way for}} local groups to help craft policies that will affect NA as a whole.

The RSC elects a delegate to attend the World Service Conference.|$|E
25|$|Robinson {{remained}} in the Seanad for four more years, although at this point <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> she had campaigned for had been tackled. Contraception had been legalised although heavily restricted, women were on juries, and the marriage bar on women in the civil service had been revoked. To the surprise of many, {{she decided not to}} seek re-election to the senate in 1989. One year later, however, Labour approached her about running for president in that year's election. She thought she was being asked her legal advice about the type of policy programme party leader Dick Spring was proposing. However, as she read the briefing notes, she began to realise that the programme was aimed at her. After some consideration, she agreed to become the first Labour nominee for the presidency and the first woman candidate in what was only the second presidential election to be contested by three candidates since 1945.|$|E

25|$|The Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824, {{designed}} to solve <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> that had arisen {{due to the}} British occupation of Dutch properties during the Napoleonic Wars, as well as issues regarding the rights to trade that existed {{for hundreds of years}} in the Spice Islands between the two nations, was a treaty that addressed a wide array of issues and did not clearly describe the limitations of expansion by either side in the Malay world. The British establishment of Singapore on the Malay Peninsula in 1819 by Sir Stamford Raffles exacerbated the tension between the two nations, especially as the Dutch claimed that the treaty signed between Raffles and the Sultan of Johore was invalid, and that the Sultanate of Johore was under the Dutch sphere of influence. The questions surrounding the fate of Dutch trading rights in British India and formerly Dutch possessions in the area also became a point of contention between Calcutta and Batavia. In 1820, under pressures from British merchants with interests in the Far East, negotiations to clarify the situation in Southeast Asia started.|$|E
25|$|Global warming {{remains an}} issue of {{widespread}} political debate, often split along party political lines, especially in the United States. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> that are settled within the scientific community, such as human responsibility for global warming, remain the subject of politically or economically motivated attempts to downplay, dismiss or deny them—an ideological phenomenon categorised by academics and scientists as climate change denial. The sources of funding for those involved with climate science—both supporting and opposing mainstream scientific positions—have been questioned by both sides. There are debates about the best policy responses to the science, their cost-effectiveness and their urgency. Climate scientists, especially in the United States, have reported official and oil-industry pressure to censor or suppress their work and hide scientific data, with directives not to discuss the subject in public communications. Legal cases regarding global warming, its effects, and measures to reduce it have reached American courts. The fossil fuels lobby {{has been identified as}} overtly or covertly supporting efforts to undermine or discredit the scientific consensus on global warming.|$|E
25|$|George Washington {{remains the}} central figure found on U.S. postage. The first {{president}} appears {{on the face of}} U.S. postage more than any other president. The engraved images of Washington found on the early issues set the precedent that all U.S. postage issues would follow in the following decades. Indeed, in virtually every U.S. definitive stamp series offered between 1851 and 1932, Washington appeared on the normal letter-rate value (the only exception being the short-lived 1869 pictorial issue); other presidents, statesmen and famous Americans were confined to the less commonly used denominations. Since the first U.S. postage stamp was issued by the U.S. Post Office, there have been more examples of George Washington appearing on U.S. postage than all other American presidents combined, including Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln and even the frequently honored Benjamin Franklin (who was not president). Examples of all the various Washington stamps are too numerous to include in this section, as <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> are very similar with only differences in color and denomination, such as the Washington-Franklin issues. Featured below are the issues that are unique in their designs and the most definitive.|$|E
