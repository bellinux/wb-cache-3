5000|$|In June 2005 he {{took part}} in Bijelo dugme reunion for 3 large {{farewell}} concerts, but even then the reports of trouble were not far behind. Apparently Tifa and Bebek got into a verbal bust-up backstage at the Sarajevo concert (the first in the series). Then one day before the Belgrade concert (the final one in the series), irritated Tifa blasted Bregovic and manager Raka Maric in Kurir daily tabloid: [...] "I hear some are already talking about continuing on with the Dugme thing. No problem, but not with me. After this concert I dont wanna see them again in this or in the next life. Maybe only in the third one. They took {{a year and a}} half out of <b>my</b> life, <b>my</b> <b>kid</b> <b>has</b> forgotten what I look like."He would reunite with Zeljko Bebek and Alen Islamovic to form a group called [...] "Kad Bi Bio Bijelo Dugme" [...] in 2006 and go on a North American tour. They returned once again in 2007 and began their worldwide tour which lasted until the end of 2010.|$|R

5000|$|A {{colleague}} described Boulton as [...] "intense {{and detailed}} in his practice of medicine, taking every {{symptom of a}} patient very seriously.

[...] Boulton described his time with his patients as a sacred place: [...] "I found myself in a sacred place {{in being able to}} touch and impact the lives of so many people." [...] When Boulton was with a child patient, that child was [...] "the most special person in the world, my favourite patient. Whenever somebody came, you had to find out what their special need or ability was, and deal with that, and it varied so much." [...] He found that the children he could help most were children with cancer: [...] "Maybe you couldn't give them the medicine, but you could give them a piece of yourself." [...] Although he practiced medicine for 35 years, he remembered almost every child patient by name.

5000|$|According to Metacritic, Marvin Kitman of Newsday gave season 1 of Doogie Howser, M.D. a 40/100 {{score and}} commented: [...] "What a wasted {{childhood}} <b>my</b> <b>kids</b> <b>have</b> had, I {{got to thinking}} while watching this otherwise normal Doogie Howser.

[...] Scott Weinberg of DVD Talk recommended season two: [...] "It's not high art, but it's a heckuva lot better than what generally passes for your average weeknight sitcom." [...] Christopher Smith of the Bangor Daily News gave season three a [...] "C" [...] grade and commented: [...] "No classic, this series. ...The show has become gratingly cute, particularly in the episodes “Doogiesomething,” “Double Doogie with Cheese,” and “Lonesome Doog.” Doog, I’m Dooged out." ...|$|E
5000|$|Almost {{a year to}} the {{day after}} his firing, Skinner took part in a phone {{interview}} with Boston Globe sportswriter Mark Blaudschun. Ending a year of self-imposed silence about what transpired at Boston College, Skinner defended his record, stating, [...] "I ran a good program, I graduated <b>my</b> <b>kids.</b> Everybody <b>has</b> problems, but we addressed them and handled them in a matter that satisfied every one." [...] Skinner continued the interview by noting that he felt had he been at BC during the 2010-11 season, the Eagles would have been more of a factor in the national picture. [...] "I know the potential we had", he said. [...] "We would have had a dog in this fight, and that we don’t bothers me." [...] His remarks, and the fact that his interview ran {{on the front page of}} the Sports section of The Boston Globe, demonstrated the ongoing controversy regarding his firing in March 2010.|$|R
5000|$|Dark Side of the Moon audio {{engineer}} Alan Parsons in 2003 {{dismissed the}} supposed effect:It was an American radio guy who pointed {{it out to}} me. It's such a non-starter, a complete load of eyewash. I tried {{it for the first}} time about two years ago. One of <b>my</b> fiancée's <b>kids</b> <b>had</b> a copy of the video, and I thought I had to see what it was all about. I was very disappointed. The only thing I noticed was that the line [...] "balanced on the biggest wave" [...] came up when Dorothy was kind of tightrope walking along a fence. One of the things any audio professional will tell you is that the scope for the drift between the video and the record is enormous; it could be anything up to twenty seconds by the time the record's finished. And anyway, if you play any record with the sound turned down on the TV, you will find things that work.|$|R
5000|$|In 2012, Wahlberg {{was quoted}} in a {{magazine}} interview regarding {{what would have happened}} if he had flown aboard American Airlines Flight 11 on September 11, 2001. He had been booked on Flight 11, but his plans changed the day before the scheduled flight and he cancelled his reservation. Wahlberg received public criticism for stating, [...] "If I was on that plane with <b>my</b> <b>kids,</b> it wouldn't <b>have</b> went down like it did," [...] and [...] "There would have been a lot of blood in that first-class cabin and then me saying, 'OK, we're going to land somewhere safely, don't worry.

5000|$|In {{response}} to a question from radio host Laura Ingraham in February 2015, Paul said that while he is not [...] "anti-vaccine" [...] at all, he does think they should be voluntary. Closing Bell co-anchor Kelly Evans attacked Paul's position during an interview with him on CNBC, to which Paul responded that some parents have (likely unfounded) fears, as he has [...] "heard of many tragic cases of walking, talking normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines." [...] Paul clarified his comments a few days later, stating that, [...] "The point is that I have heard of - I mean who hasn't ever met a child who has a profound disability and in the parents' mind they see a connection. But I didn't allege there is a connection. I said I heard of people who believe there is a connection. I do think that vaccines are a good idea.

We don’t take vacations and we don't go out to eat. Please don’t think me ungrateful. We have jobs and a nice place to live, and we’re healthy. We're the people you see every day in the grocery stores, and we obey the laws. We pay our taxes. We fly our flags on holidays and we plod along trying to make it better for ourselves and our children and our parents. We aren’t vocal any more. I think maybe we’re too tired. I believe that people like us are forgotten in America." ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issues raised}} by comparing Santayana’s warning that ‘Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it’ (1905; The Life of Reason) with the future hopes of contemporary teenager Ramon: ‘I want <b>my</b> <b>kids</b> to <b>have</b> a better life than I did. I’d like them to grow up in a more compassionate society’. Pollock (2000; Real Boys Voices). The conundrum raised by these quotations is that since Australia lacks a substantial body of historical writing about its own past and peoples (Indigenous or otherwise) which might appeal to a youth readership, how are we to avoid repeating the horrors of the past? Crew will suggest that perhaps one answer lies {{in the creation of a}} new and engaging historical genre for youth which applies emergent ficto-critical stylistics to the concepts of the Australian Historian, Professor Greg Denning (1994; Mr Bligh’s Bad Language), who advocates, ‘In writing history…I have always found that I needed to give a voice to the dead. I couldn’t give them life, of course, but I could give them a voice. And I could give the living an understanding of the past for the present…’ Denning, G. (2001) A Library Sailor. Limina Vol...|$|R
