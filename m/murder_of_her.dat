5|$|The trial {{ended with}} Lhermitte {{receiving}} the maximum sentence for the <b>murder</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> five children. The {{court and the}} jury did not take any extenuating circumstances into account. In her closing argument, Lhermitte said she would accept any punishment the court gave her and showed remorse for her actions. Earlier in the trial, psychiatrists had found that Lhermitte was not of sound mind when she committed the acts {{and should not be}} held accountable for her actions. They felt that she should be admitted into a psychiatric institution rather than going to prison, but the jury did not follow their opinions. Lhermitte had been battling with depression for many years. She concluded that she saw the <b>murder</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> children and committing suicide as her only way out.|$|E

Regardless, nearly $250,000 was raised that evening. In the aftermath, Shabazz maintained a cool relationship with Farrakhan, although she agreed to speak at his Million Man March that October.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to Scotland, Knox led the Protestant Reformation in Scotland, in {{partnership}} with the Scottish Protestant nobility. The movement may be seen as a revolution, since it led to the ousting of Mary of Guise, who governed the country in the name of her young daughter Mary, Queen of Scots. Knox helped write the new confession of faith and the ecclesiastical order for the newly created reformed church, the Kirk. He continued to serve as the religious leader of the Protestants throughout Mary's reign. In several interviews with the Queen, Knox admonished her for supporting Catholic practices. When she was imprisoned for her alleged role in the <b>murder</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> husband Lord Darnley and King James VI was enthroned in her stead, he openly called for her execution. He continued to preach until his final days.|$|E
