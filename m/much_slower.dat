40|$|The two-site Holstein model {{represents}} a first non-trivial paradigm for {{the interaction between}} an itinerant charge with a quantum oscillator, a very common topic in different ambits. Exact results can be achieved both analytically and numerically, nevertheless it can be useful to compare them with approximate, semi-classical techniques in order to highlight the role of quantum effects. In this paper we consider the adiabatic limit in which the oscillator is very <b>much</b> <b>slow</b> than the electron. A density matrix approach is introduced for studying the charge dynamics and the exact results are compared with two different approximations: a Born-Oppenheimer-based Static Approximation for the oscillator (SA) and a Quantum-classical (QC) dynamics...|$|R

60|$|With {{respect to}} the {{apparently}} sudden extermination of whole families or orders, as of Trilobites {{at the close of}} the palaeozoic period and of Ammonites {{at the close of the}} secondary period, we must remember what has been already said on the probable wide intervals of time between our consecutive formations; and in these intervals there may have been <b>much</b> <b>slow</b> extermination. Moreover, when by sudden immigration or by unusually rapid development, many species of a new group have taken possession of a new area, they will have exterminated in a correspondingly rapid manner many of the old inhabitants; and the forms which thus yield their places will commonly be allied, for they will partake of some inferiority in common.|$|R

5|$|Export is {{a special}} resource, only {{available}} to the three Asian civilizations, and is used to hire foreign troops and research technologies from the consulate, where the player can choose a foreign ally or, for the Japanese, isolationism. Export is generated automatically when the villagers are gathering, but its gather rate is <b>much</b> <b>slower</b> than other resources, making it challenging to afford a large foreign army. Export Rate / Experience points are also generated by other means (like sacred cows for Indians) and are specific to each clan.|$|E
5|$|If the ylide carbon is {{substituted}} with an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), the reagent {{is referred}} to as a stabilized ylide. These, similarly to sulfoxonium reagents, react <b>much</b> <b>slower</b> and are typically easier to prepare. These are limited in their usefulness as the reaction can become prohibitively sluggish: examples involving amides are widespread, with many fewer involving esters and virtually no examples involving other EWG's. For these, the related Darzens reaction is typically more appropriate.|$|E

5|$|Internal {{layers of}} mudstone, {{conglomerate}} and siltstone interrupt the limestone horizontally. These layers are {{more resistant to}} attack by carbonic acid and they can therefore act as protective capstones of fins, windows and hoodoos. Many of the more durable hoodoos are capped with a type of magnesium-rich limestone called dolomite. Dolomite dissolves at a <b>much</b> <b>slower</b> rate, and consequently protects the weaker limestone underneath.|$|E
5|$|Just before migration, the ruff {{increases}} {{its body}} mass {{at a rate}} of about 1% a day, <b>much</b> <b>slower</b> than the bar-tailed godwits breeding in Alaska, which fatten at four times that rate. This is thought to be because the godwit cannot use refuelling areas to feed on its trans-Pacific flight, whereas the ruff is able to make regular stops and take in food during overland migration. For the same reason, the ruff does not physiologically shrink its digestive organs to reduce bodyweight before migrating, unlike the godwit.|$|E
5|$|Luciferin-luciferase {{reactions}} {{are not the}} only way that organisms produce light. The parchment worm Chaetopterus (a marine Polychaete) makes use of another photoprotein, aequorin, instead of luciferase. When calcium ions are added, the aequorin's rapid catalysis creates a brief flash quite unlike the prolonged glow produced by luciferase. In a second, <b>much</b> <b>slower,</b> step luciferin is regenerated from the oxidised (oxyluciferin) form, allowing it to recombine with aequorin, in readiness for a subsequent flash. Photoproteins are thus enzymes, but with unusual reaction kinetics.|$|E

40|$|Mesoporous {{bioactive}} glasses (MBGs) {{with different}} compositions {{have been prepared}} and their drug release behaviors have been studied. Tetracycline (TC) is selected as the model drug. It is found that TC can be successfully loaded into the mesopores; and increasing the CaO content in MBG increases the loading ratio of TC/MBG. The drug release behaviors of MBGs are also strongly dependent on their composition. MBG 100 S without CaO in the framework has a rapid drug release kinetics, while MBG 90 S 5 C, 80 S 15 C, and 70 S 25 C show <b>much</b> <b>slow</b> release profiles and the release constant in the first 10 h decrease as the CaO content increases. However, the release constant of MBG 60 S 35 C is abnormally larger {{compared to that of}} MBG 90 S 5 C. The different drug release behaviors of MBGs have been explained by their difference in CaO composition...|$|R

5|$|For comparison, Euclid's {{original}} subtraction-based algorithm can be <b>much</b> <b>slower.</b> A single integer {{division is}} equivalent to the quotient q number of subtractions. If the ratio of a and b is very large, the quotient is large and many subtractions will be required. On the other hand, {{it has been shown that}} the quotients are very likely to be small integers. The probability of a given quotient q is approximately ln|u/(u−1)| where u=(q+1)2. For illustration, the probability of a quotient of 1, 2, 3, or 4 is roughly 41.5%, 17.0%, 9.3%, and 5.9%, respectively. Since the operation of subtraction is faster than division, particularly for large numbers, the subtraction-based Euclid's algorithm is competitive with the division-based version. This is exploited in the binary version of Euclid's algorithm.|$|E
5000|$|Andrea Reiher of Zap2it {{acknowledged}} the changes {{from the book}} and episode, specifically Big Jim's storyline, saying, [...] "Big Jim's true nature (true-true nature) is seemingly on a <b>much</b> <b>slow</b> burn for the series. In the book, Big Jim goes from wannabe BMOC to psychopath in fairly short order. The series seems to be making the character more multi-faceted and certainly not as scarily evil as the Rennie of the book. It makes sense—the show wants to be {{on for more than}} one summer (and it will be, if the ratings continue like they were for the premiere), so the writers can't blow it too early with having Big Jim go from zero to sixty in three episodes. But the slowed down evolution of Big Jim might also bring a lot more sympathy to the character, a change we think could be interesting to watch." ...|$|R
25|$|According to Christina Romer, {{the money}} supply growth caused by huge {{international}} gold inflows was a crucial source of {{the recovery of the}} United States economy, and that the economy showed little sign of self-correction. The gold inflows were partly due to devaluation of the U.S. dollar and partly due to deterioration of the political situation in Europe. In their book, A Monetary History of the United States, Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz also attributed the recovery to monetary factors, and contended that it was <b>much</b> <b>slowed</b> by poor management of money by the Federal Reserve System. Former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke agreed that monetary factors played important roles both in the worldwide economic decline and eventual recovery. Bernanke also saw a strong role for institutional factors, particularly the rebuilding and restructuring of the financial system, and pointed out that the Depression should be examined in an international perspective.|$|R

Ranolazine is indicated for the chronic treatment of angina in patients who have not achieved an adequate response with other anti-anginal agent. The present investigation was undertaken to design the extended release tablets of ranolazine employing different polymers as matrix forming agents using direct compression technique.
