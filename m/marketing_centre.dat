2500|$|Ibadan {{came into}} {{existence}} in 1829, {{during a period of}} turmoil that characterized Yorubaland at the time. It was in this period that many old Yoruba cities such as old Oyo (Oyo ile), Ijaye and Owu disappeared, and newer ones such as Abeokuta, new Oyo (Oyo atiba) and Ibadan sprang up to replace them. According to local historians, Lagelu founded the city, and was initially intended to be a war camp for warriors coming from Oyo, Ife and Ijebu. As a forest site containing several ranges of hills, varying in elevation from 160 to 275 metres, the location of the camp offered strategic defence opportunities. Moreover, its location at the fringe of the forest (from which the city got its name) promoted its emergence as a <b>marketing</b> <b>centre</b> for traders and goods from both the forest and grassland areas.|$|E

30|$|The {{implication}} {{of this is that}} the orientation of policies towards access to market as a means of fast tracking the development of smallholders should be well defined to exclusively relate to <b>market</b> <b>centre</b> participation rather than either farmgate or <b>market</b> <b>centre</b> participation. In other words, market participation can be beneficial if participants engage in <b>market</b> <b>centre</b> sales where prices are higher than at the farmgate where sale is more of a giveaway. It is worth noting that <b>market</b> <b>centre</b> sale comes with its concomitant transaction costs. That notwithstanding, the wedge between farmgate and <b>market</b> <b>centre</b> prices is usually large enough to cover transaction costs such that <b>market</b> <b>centre</b> is still remunerative than farmgate.|$|R

30|$|We find a {{statistically}} significant positive relationship between form of sale and choice of the groundnut market. Households that shelled groundnut before sale are 63.4  % more likely to sell at a <b>market</b> <b>centre.</b> The possible reason is that shelled groundnut attracts a higher economic value at <b>market</b> <b>centres</b> than at farmgate. Farmers who go through the strenuous activity of shelling would complete the cycle by selling at <b>market</b> <b>centres</b> to fetch higher returns to compensate for their efforts.|$|R

30|$|For {{choice of}} market, yield, FBOs and price of crops are the {{important}} decision variables in encouraging <b>market</b> <b>centre</b> sales. Step one in commercialisation of smallholder agriculture is participation, which is significantly influenced by yield; {{the second step}} is selling at remunerative sources (<b>market</b> <b>centres),</b> which is influenced by these three variables (yield, FBOs and price). This implies that incentivising smallholders to incur transaction costs to reach remunerative markets lies in measures that would increase yield (as discussed already), well-functioning farmer associations and offering remunerative prices for produce. A specific policy measure {{is to create a}} farmer association unit in MoFA to engage in registration and building capacity of these organisations. Also, price incentives become inevitable in considering alternatives to <b>market</b> <b>centre</b> sales.|$|R

30|$|Access {{to credit}} has a {{positive}} influence on the probability of selling and the choice of maize market. This shows that farmers with access to credit are able to produce enough marketable surpluses and then sell these at <b>market</b> <b>centres.</b> Farmers who have access to credit are 48.1  % more likely to sell maize and 26.7  % more likely to sell at the market. One argument is that access to credit gives the farmer the economic power to cultivate on a large scale and sell at <b>market</b> <b>centres.</b> Also, the obligation of paying back the loan together with the interest provides incentive for producing beyond consumption and to incur transaction costs to reach markets to benefit from remunerative prices. While the influence of credit on participation corroborates the finding of Vance and Geoghegan (2004), it contradicts the negative influence of credit on <b>market</b> <b>centre</b> sale of maize by Muamba (2011).|$|R
