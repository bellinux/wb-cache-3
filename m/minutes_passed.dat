25|$|Among {{the naval}} {{support for the}} LCAs {{approaching}} Bark South were LCS(M)s to provide supporting fire during their approach to the beaches. The naval plan worked adequately, with few exceptions, {{and there was no}} enemy air or sea interdiction. The Mediterranean was rough, however, and most of troops travelling in LCAs suffered sea-sickness, one man so much so that he died. Some worry plagued planners regarding LCAs swamping in the heavy surf at the shoreline, but the crews touched down and retracted their craft without serious difficulty. Anxious <b>minutes</b> <b>passed</b> at the Red and Green waiting positions, as by zero hour, when the assault wave of LCAs had beached, many of the LCIs and most of the LCTs had not arrived. This was largely due to the rough sea which, though inconvenient for landing ships carrying LCAs, had considerably reduced the distances landing craft could cover.|$|E

25|$|On 13 May 2012, {{the final}} day of the season, City and United were level on 86 points, though City had the {{superior}} goal difference by 8. City faced Queens Park Rangers and United faced Sunderland. With five minutes added to the total of 90 minutes, and QPR having a lead of 2–1 with ten men (having had Joey Barton sent off by referee Mike Dean for violent conduct), most of City fans lost their hopes since United were leading against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light. Manchester City won a corner on 90+2 minutes. David Silva stepped up to take the crucial set piece and as he sent the ball into the middle, Edin Džeko headed into the net to equalise the game. Two <b>minutes</b> <b>passed</b> without any kind of important goal attempts, and right before the last extra minute of added time, Sergio Agüero attempted a one-two with Mario Balotelli. After getting the ball in his feet back again, Agüero skipped past a lunging Taye Taiwo and drove the ball into the back of the net as City triumphed in their campaign. Džeko's headed goal came at 91:15 minutes, while Agüero's came at 93:20, just 13 seconds after United's match against Sunderland had concluded.|$|E

500|$|When the Liverpool {{lifeboat}} came {{alongside the}} wreck, {{some of those}} aboard were able to jump directly into the lifeboat, but others had to be roped in.

Finally, the lifeboat was able to get clear of the wreck and navigate its way though the floating debris to start its return journey to the dock. The New Brighton lifeboat was still about [...] away when the Liverpool boat left the wreck, and thus the coxswain turned her around once it became apparent that everyone had already been taken off the ship successfully.|$|E

[...] Another two <b>minutes</b> <b>passed</b> before Wright responded with permission to fire. [...] In the meantime, the US destroyers' targets escaped from an optimum firing setup ahead to a marginal position passing abeam, giving the American torpedoes a long overtaking run near the limit of their range. [...] At 23:20, Fletcher, Perkins, and Drayton fired a total of 20Mark 15 torpedoes towards Tanaka's ships. [...] Maury, lacking SG radar and thus having no contacts, withheld fire.|$|E
500|$|As the {{shooting}} took place, ABC News was signing off from its electoral broadcast, while the CBS broadcast was already over. It {{was not until}} 21 minutes after the shots that CBS's coverage of {{the shooting}} would begin. [...] ABC's Howard K.

[...] More than four <b>minutes</b> <b>passed</b> before Smith came back on the air announcing [...] "a disturbing report that Senator Robert Kennedy had been shot". [...] During that four minutes of extended coverage, the studio camera broadcast the live panic and bewilderment in the ABC newsroom. The reporters who had been present to report on Kennedy's win in the primary ended up crowding into the kitchen where he had been shot and the immediate aftermath was captured only by audio recording and cameras that had no live transmission capability. ABC was able to show scant live footage from the kitchen after Kennedy had been transported but unlike CBS and NBC, all of ABC's coverage from the Ambassador was in black and white. CBS and NBC shot footage in the kitchen of the shooting's aftermath on color film, which could not be broadcast until it was developed two hours after the incident.|$|E

2500|$|When fire {{entered the}} roof of the theatre, dry and superheated, it spread with extreme rapidity.

2500|$|Beatty {{had ordered}} his ships {{to engage in}} a line, one British ship {{engaging}} with one German and his flagship [...] doubling on the German flagship [...] However, due to another mistake with signalling by flag, and possibly because Queen Mary and Tiger were unable to see the German lead ship because of smoke, the second German ship, Derfflinger, was left un-engaged and free to fire without disruption. [...] drew fire from two of Beatty's battlecruisers, but still fired with great accuracy during this time, hitting Tiger 9 times in the first 12 minutes. The Germans drew first blood.

50|$|Aitkin High School {{is on an}} 8-period quarter/{{semester}} schedule. Each semester lasts 9 weeks. Class periods {{are currently}} 46-52 minutes in length with 4 <b>minutes</b> <b>passing</b> time in between classes. Some classes, {{such as the ones}} in the Industrial Arts area are 2 periods in length. Additionally, {{middle school and high school}} students share the same time schedule. From the years 1998-2007, the school used a block schedule, where classes were 84 minutes long while middle school classes were 42-48 minutes in length with 4 <b>minute</b> <b>passing</b> time. High School students were allowed up to 7 <b>minutes</b> <b>passing</b> times. In 2007, the trimester schedule used at AHS during the 1960s and 1970s was reinstated. Independent study periods were added on a rotation basis. (e.g. Day 1 is 1st hour, Day 2 is second hour, etc.) Independent study periods enable students to have time to finish class assignments, get help from another teacher, attend meetings and school assemblies, and much more. In recent years, the rotation basis has changed to a daily class period at the end of each day during Period 8.|$|R
