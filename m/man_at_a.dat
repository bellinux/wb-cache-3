5|$|In 1858, he {{accepted}} a teaching {{position at the}} ICY's preparatory school for boys. White furthered his interests in mathematics during his teaching stint at the institute. He became a lecturer on the subject while {{a member of the}} mathematics committee of the Banneker Institute, also becoming a proficient chess player in his leisure time. His exceptional skills with figures and calculations led to different business ventures: he was an agent for the Anglo-African weekly newspaper (1860–1861) and Pine and Palm (1860–1862). In 1861, he became a representative at the Haitian Bureau of Emigration, empowering him with the transfers of funds for free blacks who sought to move to Haiti, via New York. As a result of his different ventures, White became a relatively wealthy <b>man</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> young age.|$|E

In the weeks after the match, André feuded with other upper-card wrestlers such as Savage and Jake Roberts.

25|$|Our true {{academic}} mission — to liberally educate {{each and}} every student — is a timeless reminder of the lives we change here at Wabash College, one young <b>man</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time. For while the problems facing higher education and the world are complex, the solutions need not be. Amidst the jostle and the fray and the haranguing static and noise that often surround our academic endeavor, stands our foundation: the simple gifts of the liberal arts. These profound gifts — the ability to act, to see, and to speak — are the bedrock that underpin teaching and learning at Wabash College.|$|E
25|$|Endurance Course. This is an {{individual}} test comprising a challenging 6 mile (9.65 kilometres (km)) course whilst carrying 21 lb (9.5 kilogrammes (kg)) ·fighting order and personal weapon. The first two miles consist of undulating woodland terrain featuring obstacles such as tunnels, pipes, wading pools and an underwater culvert. The latter four miles (6.43 km) remain an obstacle-free metalled road return run back to CTCRM. Candidates are to complete this in 73 minutes. This {{is followed by a}} marksmanship test where the candidate must hit 6 out of 10 shots at a target simulating a <b>man</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> range of 200 metres.|$|E

25|$|Further {{details were}} absorbed from the imaginative retellings by Greil Marcus and Robert Palmer. Most significantly, the detail was added that Johnson {{received}} his gift {{from a large}} black <b>man</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> crossroads. There is dispute as to how and when the crossroads detail {{was attached to the}} Robert Johnson story. All the published evidence, including a full chapter on the subject in the biography Crossroads, by Tom Graves, suggests an origin in the story of the blues musician Tommy Johnson. This story was collected from his musical associate Ishman Bracey and his elder brother Ledell in the 1960s. One version of Ledell Johnson's account was published in David Evans's 1971 biography of Tommy Johnson, and was repeated in print in 1982 alongside House's story in the widely read Searching for Robert Johnson, by Peter Guralnick.|$|E
25|$|Smith had a stint with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1993 as a face,forming an {{alliance}} with top protagonist Sting, and engaging in feuds with top antagonists Sid Vicious and Big Van Vader. Smith wrestled World Heavyweight Champion Vader, {{on a number of}} occasions including the main events at Slamboree and Clash of the Champions XXIV. The feud culminated when Smith seemingly won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship from Vader on a tour of England in October 1993, though the decision was reversed. In July 1993, Smith was reportedly involved in an altercation with a <b>man</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> bar who was making advances towards his wife. As a result of the ensuing legal issues that followed, WCW released Smith from his contract in December 1993. His final pay-per-view appearance for WCW during this period came at the November 1993 Battlebowl pay-per-view, where he was teamed with Kole in the first round of the Lethal Lottery; they lost to Road Warrior Hawk and Rip Rogers.|$|E
25|$|Round {{was born}} and raised in Barrow-in-Furness (now in Cumbria but at that time part of Lancashire). He was the third of four {{children}} of a furnace <b>man</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> steel mill. Round began singing as a child in the St Paul's Mission church choir, where he met his future wife, Alice York. On leaving Barrow Technical College at the age of 15, he started working at the mill as an apprentice joiner and competed at some music festivals. In 1936 he joined the police force and was stationed in Lancaster. He found his duties generally dull, although he was posted to guard the house where Dr Buck Ruxton had notoriously killed his wife and housemaid the previous year. During this time, he enjoyed performing with local musical societies. In 1938 he married Alice at St Paul's Church, Barrow, and the couple had one son, Ellis, born in 1942, who became an aeronautical engineer.|$|E

25|$|In the LDS Church today, {{both men}} and women may enter a {{celestial}} marriage with only one living partner at a time. A man may be sealed to more than one woman. If his wife dies, he may enter another celestial marriage, and be sealed to both his living wife and deceased wife or wives. Many Mormons believe that all these marriages will be valid in the eternities and the husband will live together in the celestial kingdom as a family with all to whom he was sealed. In 1998, the LDS Church changed the policy and now also allows women to be sealed to more than one man. A woman, however, may not be sealed to more than one <b>man</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time while she is alive. She may only be sealed to subsequent partners after she has died. Proxy sealings, like proxy baptisms, are merely offered to the person in the afterlife. According to church teachings, the celestial marriage covenant, as with other covenants, requires the continued righteousness of the couple to remain in effect after this life. If only one remains righteous that person is promised a righteous eternal companion in eternity.|$|E
25|$|Between {{the events}} of the two books, quite a bit has happened. Lorena, lover of Gus McCrae, has left Clara and married Pea Eye Parker, of the former Hat Creek Outfit. They have several children, and own a farm in the Texas Panhandle. Pea Eye is {{thoroughly}} devoted to Lorena, and Lorena has learned to reciprocate and become almost equally attached to Pea Eye. Lorena teaches in a nearby schoolhouse. The cattle ranch (set up by the Hat Creek outfit in Montana) has collapsed. Newt is dead, fallen on by the Hell Bitch. Call has finally admitted to himself that Newt was his son. July Johnson is dead, and Clara lives alone. Call has gone back to being a Ranger and a gun-for-hire. Trains have greatly expanded the reach of civilization and have pushed back the frontier. The American West is no longer rough and tumble and Captain Woodrow F. Call has become a relic, albeit a greatly respected one. Nineteen-year-old Joey Garza and his deadly German rifle (capable of killing a <b>man</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> distance of half a mile) are not about to let law and order close the book on the Wild West just yet.|$|E

500|$|As a gay <b>man</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> {{time when}} {{homosexual}} practices were illegal {{for men in}} Britain, Walpole conducted a succession of intense but discreet relationships with other men, and was {{for much of his}} life in search of what he saw as [...] "the perfect friend". He eventually found one, a married policeman, with whom he settled in the English Lake District. Having as a young man eagerly sought the support of established authors, he was in his later years a generous sponsor of many younger writers. He was a patron of the visual arts and bequeathed a substantial legacy of paintings to the Tate Gallery and other British institutions.|$|E
500|$|... "(I've Just Begun) Having My Fun" [...] is {{composed}} {{in the key}} of G minor with 108 beats per minute.

Spears's vocal range spans from the high-tone of G3 to the low-tone of Eb5. The track features mainly electric guitar and bass, along with string arrangements and 1970s synthesizers reminiscent of Zapp and The Gap Band. Its lyrics refer to a make-believe situation in which Spears describes an encounter with a <b>man</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> party.
