5000|$|While still {{a member}} of {{progressive}} pop band It Bites, guitarist Francis Dunnery developed a two-handed tapping technique while recording demos between 1988 and 1989. Despite a reputation for virtuosity, Dunnery lacked interest in the heavy <b>metal</b> <b>tapping</b> styles exemplified by the playing of Edward Van Halen, Randy Rhoads and others: instead, he accidentally invented a new variant on the tapping technique by laying his electric guitar on his lap and [...] "idly tapping" [...] on the fretboard with both hands to create polyphonic chording and fast-attack scales, drawing on his additional skills as a drummer and keyboard player. Dunnery was interested enough in his discovery to continue with his approach. He collaborated with Dave Farmiloe (chief repair technician at Arbiter Guitars, {{who were at the}} time the UK distributors for Fender Guitars) in order to develop an instrument for the technique. Initial suggestions for the design included [...] "a sphere with strings on", but Farmiloe eventually came up with the less unusual final design.|$|E

Die factories do not reveal their screw threading die design techniques, so production and maintenance processes are established by trial-and-error or worker experience and passing down such techniques and documenting quality control is difficult. In this study, screw thread forming design and process analysis were carried out by combining computer-aided design software with computer-aided metal forming analysis software.

About 30 tons of magnesium producing recipe was smelted in the DC arc furnace over a continuous operation of 8 -days. Twenty-two furnace batching-tapping operations {{were carried out}} at a feed rate of 525 kg/h and a smelting temperature of 1600 - 17000 C. The MgO content in the produced slag was as low as 6. 7 %, and averaged 9. 2 % MgO, resulting in an overall magnesium extraction of 77 %, which reached 87 % during good operating periods. Magnesium vapour was extracted {{at a rate of}} 70 - 85 kg/h and was delivered to the condenser that was operated at 680 - 7200 C. The magnesium was captured in the condenser crucible in a liquid state, allowing its prompt tapping. More than 3500 kg of crude metal were produced over 15 on-line <b>metal</b> <b>tapping</b> operations. On average, a condensation efficiency of 85 % was achieved during the entire testwork, which peaked at 87 % during steady operations. The quality of the crude metal was similar to, if not better than, that of the Magnetherm’s crude magnesium. A pre-feasibility study has indicated that the MTMP has the potential for lower capital and operating costs as compared to the electrolytic process, and therefore Mintek and its consortium partners are exploring opportunities for a commercial production facility...|$|E

The feed mixtures were processed with added soil from the INEL.

The reduction of the spleen tissue to a very fine pulp is important if blockage of needles with consequent delay and considerable annoyance {{in the field is}} to be obviated. This might be accomplished by leading the pulp through a second mincer prior to delivery into pulp tank. A more thorough mincing might make a second filtration unnecessary in spite of the large amount of fibrous tissue in the spleen particularly if a more efficient method of filtration in the pulp tanks was devised. Too many <b>metal</b> <b>taps</b> were used in setting up the apparatus. These taps clog easily and are difficult to clean and sterilize. It is suggested that all connections should be rubber and glass which are far more easily cleaned. Although the use of hypertonic saline subsequently brought back to normality by the addition of 9 times the volume of water may be regarded almost as a standard laboratory procedure a detailed investigation is desirable to determine whether it is actually effective in bringing about rupture of the tissue cells, more particularly when 50 per cent. glycerine water is used as the final diluting fluid. The technique was introduced because if it did not actually assist in the process it did not in interfere with it. In the "open" method glass beads were shaken up with the vaccine to disintegrate the tissue. The sterilization plant was totally inadequate to cope efficiently with the constant demands made upon it.

Users in the Nyanza Province of Kenya frequently carry water from some distance or purchase vended water and traditionally store this water in their homes in clay pots. CARE/Kenya, a non-governmental organization working in conjunction with local women potters and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, modified these clay pots so that they fit the definition of designated safe storage water containers, which contain the following three characteristics: a narrow mouth, a lid, and a tap to prevent recontamination. Three pottery production sites were visited in order to document, analyze, and suggest improvements for the design of the modified clay pots, specifically with regards to the standardization of {{the size and shape of}} the pots, so as to allow simple and convenient standardized household chlorine dosing, and the tap design and attachment, because the current tap design is expensive and prone to leaking. (cont.) The modified clay pots displayed little variability in pot dimensions, and the 20 liter modified clay pots from the Amilo location showed a less than or equal to 10 % volume variability that is acceptable according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention household chlorine dosing procedure. A reference rope tool developed to help standardize the size of modified clay pots can be used to train new potters but is not necessary for experienced potters. The spring-operated plastic tap was found to be the most promising design to replace the current <b>metal</b> <b>tap</b> design. The material cost of the modified clay pots at the three sites was determined with some certainty to range from 202 - 370 KSH (US$ 2. 70 -US$ 4. 90). However, labor costs, transportation costs, profit margins and the role of subsidies, if they exist, were unable to be accurately determined. Therefore, cost recovery of the modified clay pot is unclear at all three pottery sites due to insufficient data. by Suzanne E. Young. Thesis (M. Eng.)
