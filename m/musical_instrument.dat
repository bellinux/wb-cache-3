5|$|The {{date and}} {{origin of the}} first device {{considered}} a <b>musical</b> <b>instrument</b> is disputed. The oldest object that some scholars refer to as a <b>musical</b> <b>instrument,</b> a simple flute, dates {{back as far as}} 67,000 years. Some consensus dates early flutes to about 37,000 years ago. However, most historians believe that determining a specific time of <b>musical</b> <b>instrument</b> invention is impossible due to the subjectivity of the definition and the relative instability of materials used to make them. Many early musical instruments were made from animal skins, bone, wood, and other non-durable materials.|$|E
5|$|A <b>musical</b> <b>{{instrument}}</b> is {{an instrument}} created or adapted to make musical sounds. In principle, any object that produces sound {{can be considered}} a musical instrument—it is through purpose that the object becomes a <b>musical</b> <b>instrument.</b> The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human culture. Early musical instruments may have been used for ritual, such as a trumpet to signal success on the hunt, or a drum in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of melodies for entertainment. Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications.|$|E
5|$|In July 1995, Slovenian {{archaeologist}} Ivan Turk {{discovered a}} bone carving {{in the northwest}} region of Slovenia. The carving, named the Divje Babe Flute, features four holes that Canadian musicologist Bob Fink determined {{could have been used}} to play four notes of a diatonic scale. Researchers estimate the flute's age at between 43,400 and 67,000 years, making it the oldest known <b>musical</b> <b>instrument</b> and the only <b>musical</b> <b>instrument</b> associated with the Neanderthal culture. However, some archaeologists and ethnomusicologists dispute the flute's status as a <b>musical</b> <b>instrument.</b> German archaeologists have found mammoth bone and swan bone flutes dating back to 30,000 to 37,000 years old in the Swabian Alps. The flutes were made in the Upper Paleolithic age, and are more commonly accepted as being the oldest known musical instruments.|$|E
