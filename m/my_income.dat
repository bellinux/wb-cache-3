500|$|From {{his boyhood}} Wodehouse had {{been fascinated by}} America, which he {{conceived}} of as [...] "a land of romance"; he [...] "yearned" [...] to visit the country, and by 1904 he had earned enough to do so. In April he sailed to New York, which he found greatly to his liking. He noted in his diary: [...] "In New York gathering experience. Worth many guineas in the future but none for the moment". This prediction proved correct: few British writers had first-hand experience of the US, and his articles about life in New York brought him higher than usual fees. He later recalled that [...] "in 1904 anyone in the London writing world who had been to America was regarded with awe and looked upon as an authority on that terra incognita.... After that trip to New York I {{was a man who}} counted.... <b>My</b> <b>income</b> rose like a rocketing pheasant." ...|$|E
500|$|Bute's land {{holdings}} in Glamorgan were {{spread out across}} the county and he took steps to consolidate them, selling around [...] {{of some of the}} outlying properties in the west and investing heavily in buying [...] of land around Cardiff between 1814 and 1826. The rising prices of land and the costs of the docks brought an end to this expansion. Estimating the profitability of the Glamorgan estates is challenging because of the way that the accounts were drawn up during the period, but estimates suggest that once land purchases and the dock building cost were factored in, the estates cost the marquess much more than they delivered in income. Bute borrowed heavily; he had inherited debts of £62,500, but by {{the time of his death}} owed £493,887. Financing and supporting this debt was difficult, particularly during the early 1840s, when credit was hard to come by, and John was forced to juggle lenders and different lines of credit. He believed that ultimately his investments would provide a rich return, and in 1844 noted that he thought [...] "well of the prospects of <b>my</b> <b>income</b> in the distance".|$|E
500|$|Sotomayor {{had wanted}} to become a judge since she was in {{elementary}} school, and in 1991 she was recommended for a spot by Democratic New York senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Moynihan had an unusual bipartisan arrangement with his fellow New York senator, Republican Al D'Amato, whereby he would get to choose roughly {{one out of every four}} New York district court seats even though a Republican was in the White House. Moynihan also wanted to fulfill a public promise he had made to get a Hispanic judge appointed for New York. When Moynihan's staff recommended her to him, they said [...] "Have we got a judge for you!" [...] Moynihan identified with her socio-economic and academic background and became convinced she would become the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice. D'Amato became an enthusiastic backer of Sotomayor, who was seen as politically centrist at the time. Of the impending drop in salary from private practice, Sotomayor said: [...] "I've never wanted to get adjusted to <b>my</b> <b>income</b> because I knew I wanted to go back to public service. And in comparison to what my mother earns and how I was raised, it's not modest at all." ...|$|E

500|$|The concerts were a {{considerable}} financial outlay for Bache, {{who did not}} have a regular salary until 1881 and had to sustain himself through teaching. By 1873, he wrote, he had to [...] "decide whether I shall sacrifice myself entirely to the production of Liszt's orchestral and choral works (which after all can never be immortal as Bach, Beethoven and Wagner: here I feel that Bülow is right). Or shall I make my own improvement the object of my life, and not spend a third of <b>my</b> <b>income</b> in one evening." [...] Bülow became concerned enough about the situation to waive his fee after one concert he conducted, and to contribute £50 out of his own pocket. Liszt was also concerned, writing, [...] "For years [...] has sacrificed money for the performance of my works in London. Several times I advised him against it, but he answered imperturbably, 'That is my business.'" [...] Whenever Bache was asked about finances for the concerts, he would tell whoever was asking that the cost was [...] "a just recompense" [...] and add that even if Liszt had charged him for his lessons {{at the same rate as}} the average village piano teacher, he would still be deeply in his debt.|$|E

He then wrote songs for various government agencies and likewise assigned all profits to them: [...] "Angels of Mercy" [...] for the American Red Cross; [...] "Arms for the Love of America", for the Army Ordnance Department; and [...] "I Paid <b>My</b> <b>Income</b> Tax Today," [...] again to Treasury.|$|E

2500|$|When {{he won the}} NIT-NACDA Athletic Directors Award, {{he said in his}} speech: [...] "I {{have always}} been a great believer in sports as part of our American way of living[...] [...] [...] [...] I am {{reminded}} of an experience I had of 40 years ago which brought home the real sudden realization of how important we are, and {{how important it is to}} have sports in our American way of life. I mentioned 40 years ago, that would bring us back to March of 1946. At that time I was involved in some high school work in Toledo, Ohio, as a football and a basketball coach. But in order to augment <b>my</b> <b>income,</b> because we weren't getting paid a great deal in those days, I was doing some officiating. I was very fortunate to be chosen by the Big Ten Conference to work the Final Four of the NCAA, which in that year was held in Madison Square Garden. I went a day or two early so I could watch the finals of the NIT Tournament. The two teams were Utah and Kentucky. On the Utah team was a little Japanese-American boy by the name of Walter Misaka. On the Kentucky team was a great basketball player, number one in the country, by the name of Ralph Beard. Misaka was about 5'10" [...] and probably weighed around 160 pounds. Beard was about 6'2" [...] or 6'3" [...] and weighed about 190 He was called 'Mr. Everything' in basketball. Nobody had ever heard of Walter, but in the man to man defense that the Utah coach, Peterson, used against Kentucky that night, Misaka was chosen to guard Ralph Beard. He held Ralph Beard to 3 points, one basket and one free throw, and as a result of the great work that this little guy did on Ralph Beard, and of course, the work of his teammates, Utah won the game and won the National Invitation Tournament Championship. Just before the end of the ballgame, with just about a minute to play, the Utah coach took Misaka out of the game. About 14,000 people in the Garden that night rose to a person and stood on their feet and cheered the great effort turned out by the little Japanese-American boy. As I reflected on it later, I thought what a great display of how sports are in the American way of life. Remember, I mentioned the date was March, 1946. We had just finished a war with Japan. There were people in the audience who had lost loved ones in the Japanese conflict. There wasn't much love in the heart of any of those people or any American for that matter, for anyone of Japanese ancestry. Yet they could cast aside all of their dislike for the Japanese race and stand on their feet at a sports contest and cheer the efforts of a little Japanese-American boy. Since that time I realize how great our sports program is in America, and how much it means to the American way of life." ...|$|E
