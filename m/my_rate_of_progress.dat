40|$|OBJECTIVES: Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is a {{potentially}} crippling or life-threatening rare disease {{that may be}} self-limited, intermittent, and chronic. Clinical predictors of outcome are still lacking, as is information on the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress</b> <b>of</b> its chronic course. The main objective is to identify factors that improve our ability to predict the course of AOSD, and factors associated with the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress</b> <b>of</b> its chronic course. A comparison with the literature is included. METHODS: A retrospective cohort observational study conducted at the tertiary-referral Rheumatology Unit in Ferrara, Italy. RESULTS: Seventy-six patients (44 females and 32 males) referred to the Unit and who satisfied the criteria for AOSD were identified. Our findings on white AOSD patients are largely compatible with those previously published. Ferritin level, as well disease activity score (DAS(28)), {{is associated with the}} <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> progression of the articular manifestations of the disease. A polyarthritis persisting over 6 months is associated with the development of a chronic articular course, irrespective {{of the size of the}} involved joints. CONCLUSIONS: Ferritin, being associated with the course of AOSD, could play a role in the diagnosis of the disease. Together with DAS(28), it might also serve as a useful predictor for the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress</b> <b>of</b> the chronic course of the disease, as measured with simple erosion narrowing score...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATION The Effect of Identities and Expectations on Emotions, Behavior, and Cognitive ChangesbyRyan Parks TrettevikDoctor of Philosophy, Graduate Program in SociologyUniversity of California, Riverside, June 2015 Dr. Jan E. Stets, ChairpersonThis {{dissertation}} advances identity theory, a sociological theory {{focusing on}} one’s self-view and the emotions, behaviors, and cognitive changes that result when others view us {{in a manner}} that is different than we view ourselves. It also extends the control model of affect, a psychological theory focusing on goals and the emotions, behaviors, and cognitive changes that occur based on one’s <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress</b> towards a goal relative to their expected <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress.</b> I test each theory’s predictions of emotions, behavior, and cognitive changes as individuals work to confirm their self-views. I also examine how these processes operate simultaneously. After collecting longitudinal survey data focusing on the student identity, I tested these predictions using structural equation modeling. The results indicate the discrepancies each theory focuses on independently influence the emotions individuals experience as they progress towards or away from identity verification. These discrepancies also lead to changes in one’s self-view, their expectations for their future <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress,</b> and their behavior. These findings extend identity theory by examining the rate at which individuals achieve verification and how this influences the emotions and behavioral outputs of the control process. This work also extends the control model of affect by showing how emotions, behavior, and cognitive changes emerge not only from the discrepancy between the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress</b> and expected <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress,</b> as theorized, but also from the distance one is from achieving their goal, or identity verification. Further theoretical implications of these findings are discussed in the final chapter along with practical applications and recommendations for future research...|$|R

40|$|Wild Cicer species possess {{high levels}} of {{resistance}} to many stresses and can contribute to enhance levels of resistances besides broadening the genetic base of cultivated chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.). However, longer duration of wild Cicer species and nonsynchronization of flowering with cultigen remains a major deterrence for their use in chickpea improvement. In this study, the response to vernalization (V), photoperiod (P), and combination of both (V + P) was studied in terms <b>of</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress</b> toward flowering in cultivated and wild Cicer species belonging to primary, secondary, and tertiary gene pools. Both V and P treatments, alone and in combination, significantly increased the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress</b> toward flowering in wild Cicer species compared with control. Effect of P in increasing the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress</b> toward flowering {{was significantly higher than}} V in C. reticulatum Ladiz., C. echinospermum P. H. Davis, C. judaicum Boiss., C. pinnatifidum Jaub. & Spach, C. bijugum Rech. f., and C. yamashitae Kitam. and vice versa in C. chorassanicum (Bunge) Popov and C. cuneatum Hochst. ex A. Rich. Synergistic effects of V and P were observed in C. bijugum, C. yamashitae, C. chorassanicum, and C. cuneatum. However, both V and P treatments had minimal effect on the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress</b> toward flowering in early-maturing and greater effects on medium- and late-maturing chickpea varieties. These results would contribute significantly to enhance use of wild Cicer species for chickpea improvement through synchronization of flowering facilitating hybridization. Also, it would improve the regeneration efficiency of wild Cicer species by genebanks and offer convenient alternate methods for rapid generation turnover...|$|R

We correct for two biases ignored in previous methodologies: non-linearity in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> change, and effort appreciation. By correcting for the first, we recognise that the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress</b> in MDG indicators is not linear across time. As for the second bias, we note that natural constraints hinder countries from achieving the targets as they approach their upper or lower bound limits. These two corrections allow us to identify countries that are making respectable progress on MDG acceleration, despite their likely failure in achieving the Goals by 2015...|$|R
