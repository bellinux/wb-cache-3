This paper describes an optimization study on the production of biodiesel from camelina seed oil using alkaline transesterification. The optimization was based on sixteen well-planned orthogonal experiments (OA 16 matrix). Four main process conditions in the transesterification reaction for obtaining the maximum biodiesel production yield (i. e. <b>methanol</b> <b>quantity,</b> reaction time, reaction temperature and catalyst concentration) were investigated. It was found that the order of significant factors for biodiesel production is catalyst concentration>reaction time>reaction temperature>methanol to oil ratio. Based on the results of the range analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA), the maximum biodiesel yield was found at a molar ratio of methanol to oil of 8 : 1, a reaction time of 70 min, a reaction temperature of 50 °C, and a catalyst concentration of 1 wt. %. The product and FAME yields of biodiesel under optimal conditions reached 95. 8 % and 98. 4 %, respectively. The properties of the optimized biodiesel, including density, kinematic viscosity, acid value, etc., were determined and compared with those produced from other oil feedstocks.

40|$|Due to the {{increase}} in the price of the petroleum and the environmental concerns about pollution coming from car gases, biodiesel is becoming a developing area of high concern. Biodiesel is the name of a clean burning alternative fuel, produced from domestic, renewable resources. Biodiesel contains no petroleum, but it can be blended at any level with petroleum diesel to create a biodiesel blend. It can be used in compression ignition (diesel) engines with little or no modifications. Biodiesel is simple to use, biodegradable, nontoxic, and essentially free of sulfur and aromatics. Developing of biodiesel is not so hard process. There are different ways of production, with different kinds of raw materials, such as crude oil, new cooking oil or frying cooking oils. In this project, the new cooking oil will be used to produce biodiesel. Biodiesel is made through a chemical process called transesterification whereby the glycerin is separated from the fat or vegetable oil. The process leaves behind two products, that is methyl esters (biodiesel) and glycerin, a valuable by product usually sold to be used in soaps and other products. Before biodiesel can be produce, there is some circumstance to face. One of the problems is the apparatus. During this time, there are no small scale biodiesel have been developed. The main objective of this project is to develop a home made apparatus for biodiesel production. After the apparatus have been made, five test batch will be held with each batch is different from it’s <b>Methanol</b> <b>quantity,</b> to determine the best ratio of Methanol to oil used to get high yield of biodiesel.

Here we report that in Torpedo synaptic vesicles, only 5 % of the total acetylcholine (ACh) or ATP content is free, and that the rest is adsorbed to an intravesicular proteoglycan matrix. This matrix, which controls ACh and ATP release by an ion-exchange mechanism, behaves like a smart gel. That is, it releases neurotransmitter and changes its volume when challenged with small ionic concentration change. Immunodetection analysis revealed that the synaptic vesicle proteoglycan SV 2 is the core of the intravesicular matrix and is responsible for immobilization and release of ACh and ATP.

Vagal evoked contractions decreased as the resting pressure was increased. The decrease affected responses to high, but not low, intensity stimulation of the vagus. Vagal evoked relaxation of the stomach increased as a linear function of resting pressure. Atropine lowered the resting pressure in vagotomized ferrets but did not alter the relation between vagal evoked relaxation and resting pressure. Intra-arterial acetylcholine evoked a contraction followed by a relaxation. The contraction was reduced at higher resting pressures but the relaxation increased. Hexamethonium {{had no effect on}} the contraction but substantially reduced the relaxation. Stimulation of the greater splanchnic nerve evoked two responses. The first, direct relaxation of the stomach (independent of cholinergic activity), bore the same relation to resting pressure as vagal evoked relaxation. The second, inhibition of vagal evoked contraction, had no relation to resting pressure. The degree of reduction in the amplitude of vagal evoked contraction by an immediately preceding vagal stimulation decreased at higher resting pressures. This was the opposite of vagal evoked relaxation. The capacity of stimulation of one cervical vagus to evoke a response as large as that from stimulation of two cervical vagi was shown to depend on the use of near-maximal levels of stimulation. At low levels of stimulation the responses to two vagi were additive, and at the lowest levels there was facilitation.

Current methods for converting methane into chemicals involve synthesis gas production, economical only at large scale. Therefore, direct methane conversion into value added products such as methanol has been an important goal for the field of catalysis. There have been developments in selective methanol production using Cu-exchanged zeolites at mild conditions, however the low yields and the absence of a selective catalytic process leave a large room for research in this field. In this thesis, both challenges were investigated using Cu-exchanged small-pore zeolites with crystallographic and spectroscopic experiments focused on the material Cu-SSZ- 13. H 2 adsorption capacity that more than triple the capacity of the best metal-organic-frameworks (MOFs), reaching 0. 05 wt. % were achieved at 30 °C and 1 atm using Cu(I) -SSZ- 13 and Cu(I) -[B]-SSZ- 13 with adsorption enthalpy around - 20 kJ mol- 1.

In the second part of the thesis, Cu-exchanged SSZ- 13, -SSZ- 16 and SSZ- 39 were tested for methanol formation and found to form <b>methanol</b> in <b>quantities</b> that are more than double the amounts produced by Cu-ZSM- 5, the most investigated alternative. The active sites for methane activation on Cu-SSZ- 13 and Cu-SSZ- 39 were identified using optical spectroscopy and theory, while the optimum conditions for the formation of higher concentrations of the active site were reported. Finally, a new catalytic methanol production process was investigated using CH 4, N 2 O, and steam on Cu-SSZ- 13, and conditions for achieving higher selectivity were suggested.

40|$|Spherical bushy cells (SBCs) in the anteroventral {{cochlear}} nucleus {{respond to}} acoustic stimulation with discharges that precisely encode {{the phase of}} low-frequency sound. The accuracy of spiking is crucial for sound localization and speech perception. Compared to the auditory nerve input, temporal precision of SBC spiking is improved through the engagement of acoustically evoked inhibition. Recently, the inhibition was shown to be less precise than previously understood. It shifts from predominantly glycinergic to synergistic GABA/glycine transmission in an activity-dependent manner. Concurrently, the inhibition attains a tonic character through temporal summation. The present study provides a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying this slow inhibitory input. We performed whole-cell voltage clamp recordings on SBCs from juvenile Mongolian gerbils and recorded evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) at physiological rates. The data reveal activity-dependent IPSC kinetics, i. e. the decay is slowed with increased input rates or recruitment. Lowering the release probability yielded faster decay kinetics of the single- and short train-IPSCs at 100 Hz, suggesting that <b>transmitter</b> <b>quantity</b> {{plays an important role}} in controlling the decay. Slow transmitter clearance from the synaptic cleft caused prolonged receptor binding and, in the case of glycine, spillover to nearby synapses. The GABAergic component prolonged the decay by contributing to the asynchronous vesicle release depending on the input rate. Hence, the different factors controlling the amount of transmitters in the synapse jointly slow the inhibition during physiologically relevant activity. Taken together, the slow time course is predominantly determined by the receptor kinetics and transmitter clearance during short stimuli, whereas long duration or high frequency stimulation additionally engage asynchronous release to prolong IPSCs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Vegetable {{oils and}} animal fats (triglycerides) {{were the first}} liquid fuels used {{in the rise of}} civilization, and now again are a {{potential}} source of alternate diesel fuel. They are 20 times as viscous as diesel fuel, however, and so form carbon deposits on diesel cylinders and injectors. They are also typically % 3 -$S/gallon, and so are too expensive to compete economically with diesel today. A number of solutions have been proposed for these problems, including transesterification, dilution, pyrolysis and Microemulsification The viscosity can be lowered by transesterification of the triglycerides with methanol or ethanol to form fatty acid esters. This cleaves the fat molecule and removes the glycerine, yielding a viscosity comparable to that of diesel. The heat of combustion is 95 % of that for conventional diesel (on a volume basis). They have a Cetane number of 50 - 80 (compared to 42 for diesel). The cost of the fuel can be reduced by using waste vegetable cooking oils. There are 350 million gallons of waste vegetable oil produced annually in the U. S. A., and various quantities available in other countries. We have developed a process for making the esters from waste vegetable oils and we call the fuel “M-Diesel”. The oil is reacted with sodium hydroxide dissolved in <b>methanol.</b> A sufficient <b>quantity</b> of alkali is used to neutralize the fatty acids in the waste oil plus 0. 3 % excess. A batch of 300 gallons was made for testing. We have tested the fuel in a Denver public bus and find power comparable to that of diesel.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this project {{is to develop a}} high {{performance}} air water heat pump which is able to be introducted in the retrofit market. The system requirements of this market are heating temperatures of 65 °C, at ambient temperatures descending until - 12 °C. To provide higher base performance ratings, the choice of the thermodynamic system is a two stage heat pump with economizer exchanger. This type of heat pump has improved performances over a large range of application. For heat output adjustment it can be switched to different heating modes (single stage and two stage). For the two stage cycle, the lubrification of the compressors is a major aspect to be studied. A new online measurement method is applied to evaluate the oil quantity which migrates through the cycle. The absorption spectre of the refrigerant - oil mixture is analysed with a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer and oil quantity can be extracted with high precision. (The analysis method has still to be refined). The infrared spectometers also allow to control the composition of the refrigerant mixture. A single capture of the spectre needs about 30 seconds. The measurements have to be referred to a regularly updated background spectre, which requests to vacuumize and clean the measurement cell. The oil migration is simultaneously measured with a high precision densitymeter. The output signal allows a real time follow of the oil <b>quantity</b> and the <b>transmitter</b> will give reliable results after calibration over the application range. Any change of the refrigerant composition cannot be captured by the densitymeter. The resulting density shift would therefore not be attributed correctly to the amount of oil. For the analysis of oil distribution in the whole heat pump, the measurement method to determine the oil level in the compressor crankcase, and the observation of the oil retention in the evaporator are also discussed in this project. The heat pump design has been made, based on simulations of the thermodynamic cycle and using existing parts in the laboratory, such as the evaporator and the condenser. The design aim is to avoid oil trapping and to ensure oil transport in the vapour lines of the heat pump. free download : www. waermepumpe. ch/fe/berichte. htm...|$|R
40|$|Post-testicular sperm {{maturation}} {{occurs in}} the epididymis. The ion concentration and proteins secreted into the epididymal lumen, together with testicular factors, {{are believed to be}} responsible for the maturation of spermatozoa. Disruption of the maturation of spermatozoa in the epididymis provides a promising strategy for generating a male contraceptive. However, {{little is known about the}} proteins involved. For drug development, it is also essential to have tools to study the function of these proteins in vitro. One approach for screening novel targets is to study the secretory products of the epididymis or the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are involved in the maturation process of the spermatozoa. The modified Ca 2 + imaging technique to monitor release from PC 12 pheochromocytoma cells can also be applied to monitor secretory products involved in the maturational processes of spermatozoa. PC 12 pheochromocytoma cells were chosen for evaluation of this technique as they release catecholamines from their cell body, thus behaving like endocrine secretory cells. The results of the study demonstrate that depolarisation of nerve growth factor -differentiated PC 12 cells releases factors which activate nearby randomly distributed HEL erythroleukemia cells. Thus, during the release process, the ligands reach concentrations high enough to activate receptors even in cells some distance from the release site. This suggests that communication between randomly dispersed cells is possible even if the actual <b>quantities</b> of <b>transmitter</b> released are extremely small. The development of a novel method to analyse GPCR-dependent Ca 2 + signalling in living slices of mouse caput epididymis is an additional tool for screening for drug targets. By this technique it was possible to analyse functional GPCRs in the epithelial cells of the ductus epididymis. The results revealed that, both P 2 X- and P 2 Y-type purinergic receptors are responsible for the rapid and transient Ca 2 + signal detected in the epithelial cells of caput epididymides. Immunohistochemical and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) analyses showed the expression of at least P 2 X 1, P 2 X 2, P 2 X 4 and P 2 X 7, and P 2 Y 1 and P 2 Y 2 receptors in the epididymis. Searching for epididymis-specific promoters for transgene delivery into the epididymis is of key importance for the development of specific models for drug development. We used EGFP as the reporter gene to identify proper promoters to deliver transgenes into the epithelial cells of the mouse epididymis in vivo. Our results revealed that the 5. 0 kb murine Glutathione peroxidase 5 (GPX 5) promoter can be used to target transgene expression into the epididymis while the 3. 8 kb Cysteine-rich secretory protein- 1 (CRISP- 1) promoter can be used to target transgene expression into the testis. Although the visualisation of EGFP in living cells in culture usually poses few problems, the detection of EGFP in tissue sections can be more difficult because soluble EGFP molecules can be lost if the cell membrane is damaged by freezing, sectioning, or permeabilisation. Furthermore, the fluorescence of EGFP is dependent on its conformation. Therefore, fixation protocols that immobilise EGFP may also destroy its usefulness as a fluorescent reporter. We therefore developed a novel tissue preparation and preservation techniques for EGFP. In addition, fluorescence spectrophotometry with epididymal epithelial cells in suspension revealed the expression of functional purinergic, adrenergic, cholinergic and bradykinin receptors in these cell lines (mE-Cap 27 and mE-Cap 28). In conclusion, we developed new tools for studying the role of the epididymis in sperm maturation. We developed a new technique to analyse GPCR dependent Ca 2 + signalling in living slices of mouse caput epididymis. In addition, we improved the method of detecting reporter gene expression. Furthermore, we characterised two epididymis-specific gene promoters, analysed the expression of GPCRs in epididymal epithelial cells and developed a novel technique for measurement of secretion from cells...|$|R

40|$|In {{the given}} review article {{analysis}} of the literature and patent sources concerning main methods for intensification of extraction processes of medicinal vegetative raw materials – use of condensed gases and supercritical fluids (SCF) on more acceptable extractants {{has been carried out}} for last 20 years. Urgency of the specified technologies consists in need for replacement of traditional extraction methods on power- and time-saving ones, and also in use of nontoxic, fire-proof and low-boiling solvents because the most of routine organic solvents (ethanol, methanol, acetone, chloroform, ethylacetate, etc.) are toxic and/or flammable or expansive and rather hard to evaporate out from extracts obtained. The abovementioned trends are the most universal for intensification of extraction processes and sometimes purification of final or intermediate products acceptable for commercial scale of manufacture. The main advantages and disadvantages of the given methods are compared for different plant species and groups of biologically active substances (BAS). It has been shown that in most cases supercritical СО 2 (SC-СО 2) are inferior in its dissolving ability to number of condensed gases and, besides, such technology is much more expensive. The range of BAS taken with SC-СО 2 is limited to mainly lipophilic compounds because of zero electrical dipole moment of SC-СО 2 and its low polarity. As extractants alternative to SC-СО 2 with higher dissolving ability SC - ethane, nitrogen monoxide, freons - R 134 а, R 23, R 32, R 408 and number of others can be used. Also to enlarge range of extractable BAS it is possible to add different cosolvents, mainly ethanol or <b>methanol</b> in <b>quantity</b> up to 20 %. At the same time in phytochemical production prospective alternatives to liquid or supercritical СО 2 are certain condensed gases with wider range of physico-chemical properties: fluorinated derivatives of hydrocarbons (freons), liquid ammonia, dimethyl ether (DME), sulfur hexafluoride (insulating gas) or their mixtures, etc. Their major characteristics include lower vapor pressure if compared with liquid СО 2, antimicrobic activity allowing to solve one the main problem in phytochemical production – microbial contamination of extracts (and other herbal drug preparations), possibility to extract not only lipophilic, but also more polar substances depending on choice of solvents or their mixes and their higher extraction rate. It has been found that some kinds of freons (for example, R 22) due to their higher polarity are able to take wider spectrum of BAS than liquid СО 2 : essential and fat oils, fat-soluble vitamins, coumarins, carotenoids, phenolic alcohols, valrates, iridoids, some alkaloids and flavonoids. Besides, certain freons (for example, С 318) have very high selectivity allowing to extract essential oils without accompanying fats. Some condensed gases, such as liquid ammonia, dimethyl ether and difluoromethane (freon R 32) can be used as well for obtaining of hydrophilic BAS (saponins, alkaloids, flavonoids). Thus such solvents should be polar enough or can be mixed with polar modifiers. Supercritical fluids and some subcritical condensed gases are suitable for fractionating of primary (crude) extracts because their selectivity considerably depends on temperature, pressure and composition (in case of mixtures with each other or with cosolvents). Also high selectivity of condensed gas and SCFs is shown in near-critical areas. Very important property of most of condensed gases and SCFs is their ability to considerably reduce microbial contamination of extracts in comparison with initial plant raw materials. Conclusions. Among existing methods for intensification of stage of plant extraction the most applicable for commercial scale is use of condensed gases and supercritical fluids as extractants. It is found that for today in the world the most widespread SCF is carbon dioxide. The main lacks of СО 2 as an extractant are high working pressure and narrow spectrum of extractable BAS which is limited only to lipophilic substances. This induces the search for alternative condensed gases and SCF among which fluorohydrocarbons (freons) are of the greatest interest. Also perspective methods of extraction intensification are applications of ultrasound, microwave field and some other methods of raw material processing, but meanwhile they have not got industrial value because of insufficient scientific base...|$|R
