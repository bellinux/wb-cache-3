Four years later the patient had to stop working because of the increasing severity of his asthma. Three months after leaving his job, the patient's asthma was greatly improved. His job consisted of placing plywood sheets into a drying machine. The plywood sheets had stayed outside in wet conditions for at least four to six weeks and were usually covered with moulds.

Methods: Spectrophotometer was used for taking color measurements based on the transmission of light through the specimens made of the selected materials which were Tooth <b>moulding</b> <b>powder</b> (DPI) and Acrylux (Ruthinium). Thirty specimens of standardized dimensions were prepared from each material. The specimens were divided into three groups of 10 each. One group of each material was immersed in tea (TajMahal) and another group of each material in cola (Pepsi) as the staining solutions.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this industrially important work was to gain an increasing understanding of the properties of materials such as CMSX- 4 nickel base super alloy, <b>mould</b> <b>powder</b> used in continuous casting of steel and coke used in blast furnace, with special reference to the thermal diffusivities. The measurements were carried out in a wide temperature range, solid, liquid, glassy and crystalline states. For CMSX- 4 alloy, the thermal conductivities were calculated from the experimental thermal diffusivities. Both the diffusivities and conductivities were found to increase with increasing temperature. Microscopic analysis showed the presence of intermetallic phases such as NiTi and NiTi 2 below 1253 K. In this region, the mean free path of the phonons {{is likely to be}} limited by scattering against lattice defects. Between 1253 K and solidus temperature, these phases dissolved in the alloy adding to the impurities in the matrix, which, in turn, caused a decrease in the thermal diffusivity. This effect was confirmed by annealing the samples at 1573 K. The thermal diffusivities of the annealed samples measured at 1277, 1403 and 1531 K were found to be lower than the thermal diffusivities of non-annealed samples and the values did not show any noticeable change with time. It could be related to the attainment of equilibrium with the completion of the dissolution of γ and γ´ phases during the annealing process. Liquid CMSX- 4 does not show any change of thermal diffusivity with temperature. It may be attributed to the decreasing the mean free path being shorter than characteristic distance between two neighbouring atoms. On the other hand thermal diffusivities of <b>mould</b> <b>powder</b> having glassy and crystalline states decrease with increasing temperature at lower temperature and are constant at higher temperature except for one glassy sample. Analogously, the thermal diffusivity measurements of <b>mould</b> <b>powder</b> did not show any significant change with temperature in liquid state. It is likely to be due to the silicate network being largely broken down. The thermal diffusivity is increased with increasing crystallisation degree of <b>mould</b> <b>powder,</b> which is expected from theoretical considerations. The coke sample, taken from deeper level of the blast furnace, is found to have larger thermal diffusivity. This could be correlated to the average crystallite size along the structural c-axis, Lc, which is indicative of the higher degree of graphitisation. This was also confirmed by XRD measurements of the different coke samples. The degree of graphitisation was found to increase with increasing temperature. Further, XRD measurements of coke samples taken from different levels in the shaft of the blast furnace show that the graphitisation of coke was instantaneous between room temperature and 1473 K.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Different phenolformaldehyde novolak resins were characterised by various methods. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was used to show the different molecular weight distributions among the different resins, {{as well as to}} give a quantitative analysis of the lower molecular weight species of the resin. Infra-red spectrophotometry along with GPC were used to show that the different molecular species of the resins were predominantly hydrogen bonded via the phenolic hydroxyl group. Thermal analysis methods, infra-red spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction techniques were utilised to elucidate certain characteristics of the different resins. Differential thermal analysis, Shawbury curometry and infra-red spectroscopy were used to study the factors affecting the cure of phenolformaldehyde resins. By various methods it was shown that the phenol content had marked effects on the cure properties of the resins, affecting not only the cure rate and the cure temperature but also the extent of cure. Further investigations into the reaction of phenol with hexamine indicated that the initiation of cross-linking by hexamine decomposition was not solely a heat dependent process. By varying the water content of phenolic resins it was shown that the water content affects both the cure of the resins and the formation of low molecular weight intermediates. Various methods of heat treating resin:hexamine mixtures indicated that under certain conditions components of a molecular weight intermediate between phenol and dihydroxydiphenylmethane could be produced. Finally a selection of commercially available <b>moulding</b> <b>powders</b> was obtained and the resin constituents characterised by the methods used previously for pure resin samples.

40|$|Fluid flow {{accompanied}} by heat transfer, solidification and interrelated chemical reactions {{play a key}} role during Continuous Casting (CC) of steel. Generation of defects and production issues are a result of the interaction between mould flux, steel grade and casting conditions. These issues are detrimental to both productivity and quality. Thus, the development of reliable numerical models capable of simulating fluid flow coupled to heat transfer and solidification are in high demand to assure product quality and avoid defects. The present work investigates the influence of steel grade, <b>mould</b> <b>powder</b> and casting conditions on process stability by including heat and mass transfer through liquid steel, slag film layers and solidifying shell. The thesis addresses the application of a numerical model capable of coupling the fluid flow, heat transfer and solidification developed by Swerea MEFOS; based on the commercial CFD code FLUENT v 12. The Volume of Fluid (VOF) method, which is an interface tracking technique, is coupled to the flow model for distinction of the interface between steel and slag. The current methodology not only allows the model to describe the behaviour of molten steel during solidification and casting but also makes the assessment of mould powders performance possible.   Direct prediction of lubrication efficiency, which is demonstrated by solid-liquid slag film thickness and powder consumption, {{is one of the most}} significant advantages of this model. This prediction is a direct result of the interaction between metal/slag flow, solidification and heat transfer under the influence of mould oscillation and transient conditions.   This study describes the implementation of the model to analyse several steel and <b>mould</b> <b>powder</b> combinations. This led to detection of a combination suffering from quality problems (High Carbon Steel + High Break Temperature Powder) and one, which provides the most stable casting conditions (Low Carbon Steel + Low Break Temperature Powder).   Results indicate the importance of steel pouring temperature, <b>mould</b> <b>powder</b> break temperature and also solidification range on the lubrication efficiency and shell formation. Simulations illustrate that Low Carbon Steel + Low Break Temperature Powder delivers the best lubrication efficiency and thickest formed shell. In contrast, High Carbon Steel + High Break Temperature Powder conveys the minimum lubrication efficiency. Therefore, it was concluded that due to absence of proper powder consumption and solidification rate the latter combination is susceptible to production defects such as stickers and breakouts during the casting sequence...|$|E

The casting powder used fulfill various tasks such as preventing air contact, absorbing non-metallic inclusions from liquid steel, providing lubrication between strand shell and mould wall and controlling heat transfer. The <b>mould</b> <b>powder</b> in contact with liquid steel surface forms a liquid slag layer. The jet of liquid steel from submerged entry nozzle is reflected at the mould wall forming a lower and upper flow pattern. The upper flow moves along the steel-slag interface and generates shear stress at the interface and waves. Viscosity-and density-differences between the two liquid phases leads under certain flow conditions to finger like protrusions. Reaching a critical flow velocity the protrusions can breakup and form slag droplets following the flow into the liquid steel-pool. These droplets can form finally non-metallic inclusions in steel material, cause defects in the final product and therefore should be avoided. Till now the physical mechanisms of slag entrainment are not completely understood. The interaction at the liquid-liquid interface was investigated using cold model study using a single-roller driven flow in oil-water systems with various silicon oil properties. The critical values of the dimension free capillary number Ca for droplet breakup marking the start of their entrainment in the lower fluid are determined over a wide-range of fluid properties defined as the product of viscosity ratio (dispersed liquid/continuous liquid) and density ratio (continuous liquid/dispersed liquid) Λ.

In addition to SiO 2, CaO, Al 2 O 3 and MgO they contained 0. 4 - 14. 3  wt% Na 2 O, 0. 3 - 1. 0  wt% K 2 O, 0. 1 - 3. 6  wt% Fe 2 O 3, 2. 6 - 7. 6  wt% fluorine and 3. 4 - 9. 1  wt% carbon. With such complex mixtures as mould powders only a half-quantitative analysis of vaporization curves could be carried out. Mass spectra were interpreted with the help of isotopic abundance ratios and equilibrium constants for the gas phase components. Hence, they were not deciphered in full and the main results are given as time/temperature dependences of ion currents. The results confirm that fluorides dominate in the gas phase. Vaporization (sublimation) occurs mainly in the form of NaF, Na 2 F 2, KF, SiF 4 and CaF 2, while gaseous AlF 3, MgF 2, AlOF are generated in smaller amounts and depend on the slag composition. Yet, in the given experimental conditions, the gas phase was found to be richer in molecular species than found previously. Analysis of the NaF/Na 2 F 2 ratio proved the existence of Na(g). Some components of the mass spectra indicate the presence of significant amounts of SiF 2 and SiO in the vapour. The relative intensities of Mg+ and MgF+ ion currents suggest that Mg in vapour is present in the form of Mg(g) and its fluorides. The extra gaseous components observed in this study could be explained by the presence of carbon in the samples. This was confirmed by comparison with the vapour phase composition of the decarburised sample of a <b>mould</b> <b>powder.</b> CO could be registered in the vapour up to temperatures 1400 - 1500 °C. In the temperature interval between 100 and 600 °C, the gas phase was formed by H 2 O and CO 2. In addition, numerous ion currents of small intensities were recorded between 100 and 450 °C but their origin remained unclear. They were attributed to impurities, though some of them may have included components of the assay, such as K 2 O or Na 2 O. HF(g) could not be detected in the vapour. The thesis is partly based on the work done within the European Coal and Steel Community Project concerning emissions of hazardous substances (the data related to pre-melted slags, fluorine free mixtures, Li 2 O substituted compositions). reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Mould powders are {{synthetic}} slags {{that contain}} mixtures of silica (SiO 2), lime (CaO), sodium oxide (Na 2 O), fluorspar (CaF 2), and carbon (C). When heated to elevated temperatures these powders liquefy and float on the liquid steel in the mould. Mould oscillation helps the liquid flux {{to penetrate the}} tiny gap between the mould and the newly formed solid steel shell. In this position the liquid flux partially solidifies against the water cooled mould, while {{a small portion of}} the flux remains liquid next to the steel shell to provide lubrication between the moving parts. Effective horizontal heat transfer in the mould is critical for solidifying the liquid steel inthe mould. This process is largely influenced by the thickness and the nature of the flux layer that infiltrates the mould/shell gap. When casting titanium stabilised stainless steels the alloying element reacts with the molten flux, ultimately changing the behaviour of the flux. During the casting process, titanium from the liquid steel reacts with the molten flux producing solids at high temperatures known as perovskite (CaTiO 3). Research has shown that perovskite reduces the lubrication capabilities of casting fluxes leading to detrimental effects on product quality while posing a serious threat of machine damage (breakout). The focus of this study is to investigate the effect of titanium pickup on the solidification nature of mould flux and the consequences on horizontal heat transfer. To achieve this, an experimental setup was constructed to simulate the behaviour of mould flux during continuous casting. Analyses of the test flux indicated that the liquid flux closest to the cold side (mould) instantly froze to produce a glassy solid structure. Closer to the hot side (steel shell), solid particles such as perovskite, cuspidine (Ca 4 Si 2 O 7 F 2), olivine (Ca,Mg,Mn) 2 SiO 4 and nepheline (Na 2 O. Al 2 O 3. (SiO 2) 2) could be identified. Similar solid particles were also found in a slag rim sample taken during the industrial casting of 321 - titanium stabilised stainless steel using SPH-KA 1 <b>mould</b> <b>powder.</b> Further investigations of the crystalline flux layers showed the entrapment of many tiny gas bubbles during solidification. This porous structure acted as a thermal heat barrier limiting horizontal heat transfer. Experimental testing on 3. 0 and 6. 0 mm flux thickness revealed that the overall thermal conductivity of mould flux decreased as the flux porosity increased. Larger amounts of gas entrapment (in the solid flux structure) resulted in higher thermal resistances which ultimately reduced the heat transfer capabilities of the flux. A second heat barrier, which has a far more dominating effect on the overall heat transfer, is created on mould surface during flux solidification. This thermal contact resistance is also found to be the result of entrapped gas bubbles. Experimental results concluded that the effect of titanium pickup on heat transfer is primarily overshadowed by the larger effect of the thermal contact resistance that is formed during mould flux solidification. The contact resistance in combination with gas entrapment in the solid crystalline structure is considered to be the key factors preventing horizontal heat transfer during continuous casting.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this industrially important work was to gain an increasing understanding of the properties of some industrially important materials such as CMSX- 4 nickel base super alloy, 90 Ti. 6 Al. 4 V alloy, 25 Cr: 6 Ni stainless steel, 0. 7 % carbon steel, AISI 304 stainless steel-alumina composites, <b>mould</b> <b>powder</b> used in continuous casting of steel as well as coke used in blast furnace with special reference to the thermal diffusivities. The measurements were carried out in a wide temperature range covering solid, liquid, glassy and crystalline states. For CMSX- 4 alloy, the thermal conductivities were calculated from the experimental thermal diffusivities. Both the diffusivities and conductivities were found to increase with increasing temperature. Microscopic analysis showed the presence of intermetallic phases γ´ such as Ni 3 Al below 1253 K. In this region, the mean free path of the electrons and phonons {{is likely to be}} limited by scattering against lattice defects. Between 1253 K and solidus temperature, these phases dissolved in the alloy adding to the impurities in the matrix, which, in turn, caused a decrease in the thermal diffusivity. This effect was confirmed by annealing the samples at 1573 K. The thermal diffusivities of the annealed samples measured at 1277, 1403 and 1531 K were found to be lower than the thermal diffusivities of non-annealed samples and the values did not show any noticeable change with time. It could be related to the attainment of equilibrium with the completion of the dissolution of γ´ phase during the annealing process. Liquid CMSX- 4 does not show any change of thermal diffusivity with temperature. It may be attributed to the decrease of the mean free path being shorter than characteristic distance between two neighbouring atoms. Same tendency could be observed in the case of 90 Ti. 6 Al. 4 V alloy. Since the thermal diffusivity increases with increasing temperature below 1225 K and shows slight decrease or constancy at higher temperature. For 25 Cr: 6 Ni stainless steel, the thermal diffusivity is nearly constant up to about 700 K. Beyond that, there is an increase with temperature both during heating as well as cooling cycle. On the other hand, the slope of the curve increases above 950 K, which can be due to the increase of bcc phase in the structure. 0. 7 % carbon steel shows a decrease in the thermal diffusivity at temperature below Curie point, where the structure contains bcc+ fcc phases. Above this point the thermal diffusivity increases, where the structure contains only fcc phase. The experimental thermal conductivity values of these alloys show good agreement with the calculated values using Mills model. Thermal diffusivity measurements as a function of temperature of sintered AISI 304 stainless steel-alumina composites having various composition, viz, 0. 001, 0. 01, 0. 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 and 10 wt% Al 2 O 3 were carried out in the present work. The thermal diffusivity as well as the thermal conductivity were found to increase with temperature for all composite specimens. The thermal diffusivity/conductivity decreases with increasing weight fraction of alumina in the composites. The experimental results are in good agreement with simple rule of mixture, Eucken equation and developed Ohm´s law model at weight fraction of alumina below 5 wt%. Beyond this, the thermal diffusivity/ conductivity exhibits a high discrepancy probably due to the agglomeration of alumina particles during cold pressing and sintering. On the other hand, thermal diffusivities of industrial mould flux having glassy and crystalline states decrease with increasing temperature at lower temperature and are constant at higher temperature except for one glassy sample. The thermal diffusivity is increased with increasing crystallisation degree of mould flux, which is expected from theoretical considerations. Analogously, the thermal diffusivity measurements of mould flux do not show any significant change with temperature in liquid state. It is likely to be due to the silicate network being largely broken down. In the case of coke, the sample taken from deeper level of the pilot blast furnace is found to have larger thermal diffusivity. This can be correlated to the average crystallite size along the structural c-axis, Lc, which is indicative of the higher degree of graphitisation. This was also confirmed by XRD measurements of the different coke samples. The degree of graphitisation was found to increase with increasing temperature. Further, XRD and heat capacity measurements of coke samples taken from different levels in the shaft of the pilot blast furnace show that the graphitisation of coke was instantaneous between 973 and 1473 K.
