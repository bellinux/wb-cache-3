5|$|CIS Vancouver and Pac Title created most of {{the visual}} effects, under the overall {{supervision}} of Michael Owens. CIS' work was headed by Geoff Hancock and Pac Title's by Mark Freund. Each studio created around 90 shots. Pac Title focused primarily on 2D imagery; VICON House of Moves handled the motion capture. The effects work consisted mainly of peripheral additions: architecture, vehicles, crowds and furniture. CIS used 3D <b>modeling</b> <b>package</b> Maya to animate city scenes before rendering them in mental ray; they generated matte paintings in Softimage XSI and Maya, and used Digital Fusion for some 2D shots. The team's work began with research into 1928 Los Angeles; they referenced historical photographs and data on the urban core's population density. CIS had to generate mostly new computer models, textures and motion capture because the company's existing effects catalog consisted primarily of modern era elements. CIS supplemented exteriors with skylines and detailed backdrops. They created set extensions digitally and with matte paintings. CIS created city blocks by using shared elements of period architecture that could be combined, rearranged and restacked to make buildings of different widths and heights; that way, the city could look diverse {{with a minimum of}} textural variation. CIS referenced vintage aerial photographs of downtown Los Angeles so shots would better reflect the geography of the city, as Hancock felt it important to have a consistency that would allow audiences to understand and become immersed in the environment.|$|E

It has been used for real-time weather as well as seasonal forecasting of convection, tornadoes and tropical cyclones, among other uses. Its atmospheric modeling aspects are intended to use and complement rather than replace the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF-ARW/NMM), the Global Forecast System (GFS) and the Community Earth System Model (CESM).|$|E
50|$|A polygon soup is a {{group of}} unorganized triangles, with {{generally}} no relationship whatsoever. Polygon soups are a geometry storage format in a 3D <b>modeling</b> <b>package,</b> such as Maya, Houdini, or Blender. Polygon soup can help save memory, load/write time, and disk space for large polygon meshes compared to the equivalent polygon mesh. The larger the polygon soup, the larger the savings. For instance, fluid simulations, particle simulations, rigid-body simulations, environments, and character models can reach into the millions of polygon for feature films, causing large disk space and read/write overhead. As soon as any kind of hierarchical sorting or clustering scheme is applied, the polygon soup mesh becomes something else (one example being an octree, a subdivided cube). Any kind of polygonal geometry that hasn't been grouped in any way can be considered polygon soup. Optimized meshes may contain grouped items to make drawing faster.|$|E

By definition, Engine reads only Protein Data Bank (file format) atomic configuration files and handles other definitions and attributes. In fullrmc atoms can be grouped into rigid bodies or semi-rigid bodies called groups so the system can evolve atomically, clusterly, molecularly or any combination of those. Every group can be assigned a different and customizable move generator (translation, rotation, a combination of moves generators, etc.). Groups selection by the fitting engine can also be customizable. Also fullrmc uses Artificial intelligence and Reinforcement learning algorithms to improve the ratio of accepted moves.|$|E

40|$|This Technical Review Report (TRR) {{summarizes}} the review findings for the Safety Analysis Report for Packaging (SARP) for the Model 9977 B(M) F- 96 shipping container. The content analyzed for this submittal is Content Envelope C. 1, Heat Sources, in assemblies of Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators or food-pack cans. The SARP under review, i. e., S-SARP-G- 00001, Revision 2 (August 2007), was originally {{referred to as}} the General Purpose Fissile Material Package. The review presented in this TRR was performed using the methods outlined in Revision 3 of the Department of Energy's (DOE's) Packaging Review Guide (PRG) for Reviewing Safety Analysis Reports for Packages. The format of the SARP follows that specified in Revision 2 of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's, Regulatory Guide 7. 9, i. e., Standard Format and Content of Part 71 Applications for Approval of Packages for Radioactive Material. Although the two documents are similar in their content, they are not identical. Formatting differences have been noted in this TRR, where appropriate. The <b>Model</b> 9977 <b>Package</b> is a 35 -gallon drum package design that has evolved from a family of packages designed by DOE contractors at the Savannah River Site. The <b>Model</b> 9977 <b>Package</b> design includes a single, 6 -inch diameter, stainless steel pressure vessel containment system (i. e., the 6 CV) that was designed and fabricated in accordance with Section III, Subsection NB, of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Boiler & Pressure Vessel Code. The earlier package designs, i. e., the Model 9965, 9966, 9967 and 9968 Packages, were originally designed and certified in the 1980 s. In the 1990 s, updated package designs that incorporated design features consistent with new safety requirements, based on International Atomic Energy Agency guidelines, were proposed. The updated package designs were the Model 9972, 9973, 9974 and 9975 <b>Packages,</b> respectively. The <b>Model</b> 9975 <b>Package</b> was certified by the Packaging Certification Program, under the Office of Safety Management and Operations. Differences between the <b>Model</b> 9975 <b>Package</b> and the <b>Model</b> 9977 <b>Package</b> include: (1) The lead shield present in the <b>Model</b> 9975 <b>Package</b> is absent in the Model 9977 Package; (2) The <b>Model</b> 9975 <b>Package</b> has eight allowable contents, while the <b>Model</b> 9977 <b>Package</b> has a single allowable content. (3) The 6 CV of the <b>Model</b> 9977 <b>Package</b> is similar in design to the outer Containment Vessel of the <b>Model</b> 9975 <b>Package</b> that also incorporates a 5 -inch Containment Vessel as the inner Containment Vessel. (4) The <b>Model</b> 9975 <b>Package</b> uses a Celotex{reg_sign}-based impact limiter while the <b>Model</b> 9977 <b>Package</b> uses Last-A-Foam{reg_sign}, a polyurethane foam, for the impact limiter.
