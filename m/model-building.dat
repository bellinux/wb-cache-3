5|$|The core {{concept of}} general-relativistic <b>model-building</b> {{is that of}} a {{solution}} of Einstein's equations. Given both Einstein's equations and suitable equations for the properties of matter, such a solution consists of a specific semi-Riemannian manifold (usually defined by giving the metric in specific coordinates), and specific matter fields defined on that manifold. Matter and geometry must satisfy Einstein's equations, so in particular, the matter's energy–momentum tensor must be divergence-free. The matter must, of course, also satisfy whatever additional equations were imposed on its properties. In short, such a solution is a model universe that satisfies the laws of general relativity, and possibly additional laws governing whatever matter might be present.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{was first}} {{isolated}} by Friedrich Miescher in 1869. Its molecular structure was first identified by James Watson and Francis Crick at the Cavendish Laboratory within the University of Cambridge in 1953, whose <b>model-building</b> efforts were guided by X-ray diffraction data acquired by Raymond Gosling, {{who was a}} post-graduate student of Rosalind Franklin. DNA is used by researchers as a molecular tool to explore physical laws and theories, such as the ergodic theorem and the theory of elasticity. The unique material properties of DNA have made it an attractive molecule for material scientists and engineers interested in micro- and nano-fabrication. Among notable advances in this field are DNA origami and DNA-based hybrid materials.|$|E

25|$|Part of {{the problem}} in this debate {{revolved}} around the high level of abstraction and idealization that occurs in economic <b>model-building</b> on topics such as capital and economic growth. The original neoclassical models of aggregate growth presented by Robert Solow and Trevor Swan were straightforward, with simple results and uncomplicated conclusions which implied predictions about the real, empirical, world. The followers of Robinson and Sraffa argued that more sophisticated and complicated mathematical models implied that for the Solow-Swan model to say anything about the world, crucial unrealistic assumptions (that Solow and Swan had ignored) must be true.|$|E
25|$|Defining {{structure}} and detecting {{the emergence of}} complexity in nature are inherently subjective, though essential, scientific activities. Despite the difficulties, these problems can be analysed {{in terms of how}} <b>model-building</b> observers infer from measurements the computational capabilities embedded in non-linear processes. An observer’s notion of what is ordered, what is random, and what is complex in its environment depends directly on its computational resources: the amount of raw measurement data, of memory, and of time available for estimation and inference. The discovery of structure in an environment depends more critically and subtly, though, on how those resources are organized. The descriptive power of the observer’s chosen (or implicit) computational model class, for example, can be an overwhelming determinant in finding regularity in data.|$|E
500|$|The last {{of these}} seminal papers {{addressed}} the general-relativistic {{treatment of the}} mechanics of continuous media. However useful {{the notion of a}} point mass may be in classical physics; in general relativity, such an idealized mass concentration into a single point of space is not even well-defined. That is why relativistic hydrodynamics, that is, the study of continuous media, {{is an essential part of}} <b>model-building</b> in general relativity. The paper systematically describes the basic concepts and models in what the editor of the journal General Relativity and Gravitation, on the occasion of publishing an English translation 32 years after the original publication date, called [...] "one of the best reviews in this area".|$|E

2500|$|The {{requirements}} of macromolecular crystallography also drove MG because [...] the traditional techniques of physical <b>model-building</b> could not scale. The first two protein structures solved by molecular graphics {{without the aid}} of the Richards' Box were built with Stan Swanson's program FIT on the Vector General graphics display in the laboratory of Edgar Meyer at Texas A University: First Marge Legg in Al Cotton's lab at A solved the structure of staph. nuclease (1975) and then Jim Hogle solved the structure of monoclinic lysozyme in 1976. A full year passed before other graphics systems were used to replace the Richards' Box for modelling into density in 3-D. Alwyn Jones' FRODO program (and later [...] "O") were developed to overlay the molecular electron density determined from X-ray crystallography and the hypothetical molecular structure.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{also not}} clear how {{important}} Franklin's unpublished results from the progress report actually were for the <b>model-building</b> done by Watson and Crick. After the first crude X-ray diffraction images of DNA were collected in the 1930s, William Astbury had talked about stacks of nucleotides spaced at 3.4 angström (0.34 nanometre) intervals in DNA. A citation to Astbury's earlier X-ray diffraction work {{was one of only}} eight references in Franklin's first paper on DNA. Analysis of Astbury's published DNA results and the better X-ray diffraction images collected by Wilkins and Franklin revealed the helical nature of DNA. It was possible to predict the number of bases stacked within a single turn of the DNA helix (10 per turn; a full turn of the helix is 27 angströms [...] in the compact A form, 34 angströms [...] in the wetter B form). Wilkins shared this information about the B form of DNA with Crick and Watson. Crick did not see Franklin's B form X-ray images (Photo 51) until after the DNA double helix model was published.|$|E
2500|$|The {{two most}} common and {{large-scale}} sources of error in homology modeling are poor template selection and inaccuracies in target-template sequence alignment. Controlling for these two factors by using a structural alignment, or a sequence alignment produced {{on the basis of}} comparing two solved structures, dramatically reduces the errors in final models; these [...] "gold standard" [...] alignments can be used as input to current modeling methods to produce quite accurate reproductions of the original experimental structure. Results from the most recent CASP experiment suggest that [...] "consensus" [...] methods collecting the results of multiple fold recognition and multiple alignment searches increase the likelihood of identifying the correct template; similarly, the use of multiple templates in the <b>model-building</b> step may be worse than the use of the single correct template but better than the use of a single suboptimal one. Alignment errors may be minimized by the use of a multiple alignment even if only one template is used, and by the iterative refinement of local regions of low similarity.|$|E

50|$|Empirical {{modelling}} is {{a generic}} term for activities that create models by observation and experiment. Empirical Modelling (with the initial letters capitalised, and often abbreviated to EM) {{refers to a}} specific variety of empirical modelling in which models are constructed following particular principles. Though {{the extent to which}} these principles can be applied to <b>model-building</b> without computers is an interesting issue (to be revisited below), there are at least two good reasons to consider Empirical Modelling in the first instance as computer-based. Without doubt, new technologies that are based on computers have had a transformative impact where the full exploitation of Empirical Modelling principles is concerned. What is more, the conception of Empirical Modelling has been closely associated with thinking about the role of the computer in <b>model-building.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{this type}} of in-database processing, a {{predictive}} model is converted from its source language into SQL that can run in the database usually in a stored procedure.
