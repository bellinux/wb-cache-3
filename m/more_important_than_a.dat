5|$|The {{tradition}} of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent {{for much of}} the sixteenth century. In his majority James V was probably more concerned with architectural expressions of royal identity. Mary Queen of Scots had been brought up in the French court, where she was drawn and painted by major European artists, but she did not commission any adult portraits, {{with the exception of the}} joint portrait with her second husband Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley. This may have reflected an historic Scottish pattern, where heraldic display, or an elaborate tomb were considered <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> portrait.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. strike {{aircraft}} were running about 20 minutes behind the Japanese. Believing that a speedy attack was <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> massed attack, {{and because they}} lacked fuel to spend time assembling prior to the strike, the U.S. aircraft proceeded in small groups towards the Japanese ships, rather than forming into a single large strike force. The first group—consisting of 15 Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers, six Grumman TBF-1 Avenger torpedo bombers, and eight Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters, led by Lieutenant Commander R. Eation from Hornet—was on its way by about 08:00. A second group—consisting of three SBDs, seven TBFs, and eight Wildcats from Enterprise—was off by 08:10.

25|$|Walayah is {{translated}} from Arabic as “guardianship” and denotes “Love and devotion for God, the Prophets, the Aimmat and Imām uz Zaman, and the Dai.” It also denotes Ta'at (following every order without protest, but with one's soul's happiness, knowing {{that nothing is}} <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> command from God and that the command of His vicegerents is His Word). In Ismāʿīlī doctrine, God is the true desire of every soul, and He manifests himself in the forms of Prophets and Imāms; to be guided to his path, one requires a messenger or a guide: a Dai. For the true mawali of the Imam and Dai, heaven is made obligatory. And only with this crucial walayat, they believe, will all the other pillars and acts ordained by Islam be judged or even looked at by God.|$|E

25|$|The French army {{expected}} that another {{war would be}} won by a mass army, {{even if it was}} full of short service and sketchily trained men and the period of twelve-month conscription lasted from 1928 until 1935. An army of one-year conscripts was accepted by the army, because a big, fairly well trained army in wartime was considered <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> highly trained, quick responding and offensively minded army in peacetime. From 220,000–230,000 men were trained each year, half being called up every six months, the previous group moving to the active army as the new men began training. The 106,000-man regular army was capable only of manning frontier defences, training recruits and providing planning staffs; when the garrison in the Rhineland returned, the army lost the capacity for independent or limited action in Europe without mobilisation. In the context of the later 1920s, the decline in the readiness of the standing army {{did not seem to be}} a disadvantage. By the time the one-year law affected numbers in 1932, there were 358,000 soldiers in metropolitan France, of whom 232,000 men were trained enough for operations. By 1933, there were 320,000 soldiers in mainland France, with 226,000 having had more than six months' training; the French army was only twice the size of the German Reichswehr, which was staffed with highly trained soldiers because of the long term period of service imposed by the treaty of Versailles.|$|E
500|$|A survey {{conducted}} by Minnesota's Department for Families and Children's Services shows that men consider child care to be far <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> paycheck. Of 600 dads surveyed, a majority said their most important role was to [...] "show love and affection" [...] to kids. [...] "Safety and protection" [...] came next, followed by [...] "moral guidance," [...] "taking time to play," [...] and [...] "teaching and encouraging." [...] "Financial care" [...] finished last. [...] Many men are now becoming more involved in their children's lives, {{and because of that}} many men now {{have a better understanding of}} what life is like for their child growing up in modern society. [...] Because fathers are immersed in their children's lives, many of the stereotypically [...] "manly" [...] attitudes and activities historically prescribed for children may be circumscribed due to a more gender-neutral parenting approach that focuses on promoting independence and emotional well being. This allows children, especially male children, to grow up with a greater capacity for empathy and less rigidity in attitudes pertaining to gender roles than would perhaps be the case in more traditionally-structured households.|$|E
500|$|Around 1500, {{about the}} same time as in England, Scottish monarchs turned to the {{recording}} of royal likenesses in panel portraits, painted in oils on wood, perhaps as a form of political expression. In 1502 James IV paid for delivery of portraits of the Tudor household, probably by the [...] "Inglishe payntour" [...] named [...] "Mynours," [...] who stayed in Scotland to paint the king and his new bride Margaret Tudor the following year. [...] "Mynours" [...] was Maynard Wewyck, a Flemish painter who usually worked for Henry VII in London. As in England, the monarchy may have had model portraits of royalty used for copies and reproductions, but the versions of native royal portraits that survive are generally crude by continental standards. Much more impressive are the works or artists imported from the continent, particularly the Netherlands, generally considered the centre of painting in the Northern Renaissance. The products of these connections included a fine portrait of William Elphinstone. It is one of the earliest representations of a Scottish subject to survive and was probably painted by a Scots artist using Flemish techniques. The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent for much of the sixteenth century. In his majority James V was probably more concerned with architectural expressions of royal identity. Mary Queen of Scots had been brought up in the French court, where she was drawn and painted by major European artists, but she did not commission any adult portraits, with the exception of the joint portrait with her second husband Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley.

2500|$|A {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} Gârbea's main works is the reliance on intertextuality, as compliments to his predecessors in drama, novel and poetry. Speaking in 2009, Gârbea himself recalled his stylistic discovery of the 1980s: [...] "It still {{seemed to me that}} being a writer meant having visions and struggling to communicate them so that others may have them too. [...] I could not write prose, but I enjoyed writing drama because I had invented something very fun to do: old characters in new situations." [...] Poet and critic Octavian Soviany noted: [...] "Horia Gârbea is a dramatist who builds with a program in mind, placing his stake on the resources of parody and the intertextual play. The parodic here is given birth by the disabused conscience of a postmodern spirit, who knows that all books have been written and therefore only their 'rewriting' [...] is still possible". Commenting on the texts grouped within Cine l-a ucis pe Marx?, literary critic Mircea A. Diaconu placed the intertextual references (which often make a point of transgressing historical reality) in connection with William Shakespeare's phrase [...] "All the world's a stage", since [...] "everything is possible {{at the level of the}} text becoming reality". He praises the author for managing to preserve an [...] "absence that imposes", by not making his own intervention felt in the text. Diaconu admits that such an approach could be read as [...] "gratuitously bookish, [...] a line is more important than an event, a pun <b>more</b> <b>important</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> murder", but supports the notion that they all display an [...] "existential bearing", accounting for an [...] "intrinsic value." [...] He speaks of the technique as [...] "a vengeance of the theater" [...] on the traditional historical record: [...] "In essence, Horia Gârbea's theater emerges from the textual inconsistency of the world when faced with the consistency of history, or, better yet, from the inconsistency of history and the textual consistency of the world." ...|$|E
