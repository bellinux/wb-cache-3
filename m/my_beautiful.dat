5|$|Production {{was led by}} West himself, {{alongside}} a variety of high-profile record producers including Mike Dean, No I.D., Jeff Bhasker, RZA, S1, Bink and DJ Frank E. Noted by critics for its maximalist aesthetic, opulent production quality, and dichotomous themes, <b>My</b> <b>Beautiful</b> Dark Twisted Fantasy incorporates aspects of West's previous works, including soul, baroque, electro, and symphonic styles. The album deals with themes of excess and celebrity, and explores such issues as consumer culture, race, and the idealism of the American Dream.|$|E
5|$|Expanding on {{the dense}} {{production}} style of West's 2010 album <b>My</b> <b>Beautiful</b> Dark Twisted Fantasy, Watch the Throne incorporates orchestral and progressive rock influences, unconventional samples, and dramatic melodies in its sound. Jay-Z and West's braggadocio lyrics exhibit themes of opulence, fame, materialism, power, and {{the burdens of}} success, {{as well as political}} and socioeconomic context. The album expresses other topics such as Jay-Z's thoughts on fatherhood, West's reflection on being deemed a social villain, and their success as performers. Music writers interpreted the subject matter to concern the rappers' plight as African Americans struggling with financial success in America.|$|E
5|$|<b>My</b> <b>Beautiful</b> Dark Twisted Fantasy debuted {{at number}} one on the Billboard 200 albums chart, selling 496,000 copies in the United States during its first week. It was West's fourth {{consecutive}} US number-one album, and its debut week served as the fourth-best sales week of 2010, while its first-week digital sales of 224,000 copies served as the fourth-highest sales week for a digitally-downloaded album. It spent 32 weeks on the Billboard 200, and by July 2013, it had sold 1,351,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan.|$|E

5000|$|<b>My</b> Crazy <b>Beautiful</b> Life is a 2012 {{illustrated}} autobiography by the {{pop singer}} Kesha and photographer/filmmaker Steven Greenstreet. Photography was also provided by Jason Sheldon and Lagan Sebert, who also {{helped develop the}} project with Ke$ha. The book was published by Simon & Schuster on November 20, 2012 {{to coincide with the}} release of her album Warrior on November 30, 2012. The book's title, <b>My</b> Crazy <b>Beautiful</b> Life is taken after her song [...] "Crazy Beautiful Life" [...] from her 2010 EP Cannibal.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the release}} of his fifth album, <b>My</b> <b>Beautiful</b> Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010), West collaborated with {{longtime}} friend Jay Z on Watch the Throne (2011). In July 2012, producer No I.D. revealed {{that he had been}} working on West's sixth solo studio album (and seventh overall) {{and that it would be}} released after Cruel Summer (2012), a collaborative compilation album between members of West's record label GOOD Music. For Yeezus, West enlisted several collaborators, including Kid Cudi, Charlie Wilson, S1, The Heatmakerz, Mike Dean, Hudson Mohawke, Skrillex, Young Chop, Chief Keef, Frank Ocean, Odd Future, Travis Scott, The-Dream, Cyhi the Prynce, Malik Yusef, King L, John Legend, James Blake, RZA, Mase and Pusha T.

5|$|On October 17, 2010, Kanye West {{revealed}} through Twitter that <b>My</b> <b>Beautiful</b> Dark Twisted Fantasy {{had been}} rejected by certain stores because of the cover art. The artwork (a portrait by George Condo) shows West being straddled by an armless winged female (a phoenix). Both characters are depicted nude, and one nipple of the phoenix's breasts and her buttocks are visible. The artist later said that Kanye wanted a cover image that would be banned. The painting is centered with a thin yellow border on a red background. The artwork follows along the apparent theme of the album, as well as West's music film Runaway. This {{is one of five}} covers; all of them were included with its purchase. A second cover, with a painting of a ballerina by Condo, was posted on the Amazon.com pre-order page. It was intended to be the original artwork for Runaway, but West used a photograph of a ballerina instead.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, Piper {{chose to}} give up her {{anonymity}} in order to increase awareness about burn victims. The Channel 4 documentary Katie: <b>My</b> <b>Beautiful</b> Face was first aired on 29 October 2009 as part of the Cutting Edge series; it has subsequently been repeated on several occasions, made available for online on-demand access and sold internationally.|$|E
25|$|In May 2010 it was {{confirmed}} that Katie Piper {{would be involved}} in a new series for Channel 4. The series would again see Piper working with Mentorn Media, producer of Katie: <b>My</b> <b>Beautiful</b> Face. The series features Piper meeting people who have been disfigured, disabled or physically altered as a result of illness, injury, assault, accident or surgery. A call for potential interview subjects appeared on Channel 4's 'Take Part' website in May 2010. The films also chronicle the development and growth of the Katie Piper Foundation, and Piper's efforts towards this. The series is titled Katie: <b>My</b> <b>Beautiful</b> Friends, and began its four-part run on 22 March 2011. Items of supporting information and relevant associated content relating to the programme were placed on the Channel 4 website in tandem with the programme's broadcast.

25|$|Around {{the time}} of the {{broadcast}} of Katie: <b>My</b> <b>Beautiful</b> Friends, Piper appeared on a number of magazine and features programmes to discuss the series, in some cases accompanied by one of the ambassadors; these appearances included This Morning (with Adele), The Vanessa Show (with Amitish), Fern (with Kayleigh), OK! TV and Loose Women (Piper alone). Piper also appeared on BBC Radio 5 Live with Chantelle as guests of Phil Williams (sitting in for Victoria Derbyshire), but prior to their going on air Chantelle was insulted by a security guard at the studios, an incident which was subsequently referred to by Williams on-air during the interview.|$|E
25|$|While {{living in}} London, Zimmer wrote {{advertising}} jingles for Air-Edel Associates. In the 1980s, Zimmer partnered with Stanley Myers, a prolific film composer {{who wrote the}} scores for over sixty films. Zimmer and Myers co–founded the London–based Lillie Yard recording studio. Together, Myers and Zimmer worked on fusing the traditional orchestral sound with electronic instruments. Some of the films on which Zimmer and Myers worked are Moonlighting (1982), Success is the Best Revenge (1984), Insignificance (1985), and <b>My</b> <b>Beautiful</b> Laundrette (1985).

25|$|Subsequent to the attack, Piper {{moved out}} of her London flat and {{returned}} to Hampshire {{to live with her}} parents and younger sister Suzy. Her mother, Diane Piper, who was a classroom assistant in a primary school, gave up her job so she could look after her daughter following the attack. Following her recovery and the successful establishment of the Katie Piper Foundation, Piper again {{moved out of}} the family home and returned to living alone in London, a process documented in episodes of Katie: <b>My</b> <b>Beautiful</b> Face; she later moved to live with her partner Richard, a carpenter and eventual father of Belle. Although no longer resident there, Piper continues to maintain strong links with Andover and Hampshire, where her family remains.|$|E
25|$|Although Piper had {{the right}} to remain {{anonymous}} because of the sexual assault, she chose to waive her anonymity, in an attempt to increase public awareness of the situation for burn victims, and also the treatment they go through. Piper also took part in a documentary about her experience, Katie: <b>My</b> <b>Beautiful</b> Face, which was aired by Channel 4 on 29 October 2009, and, according to figures from Attentional, gained over 3.3million viewers. The programme was repeated three times during 2009: once on Christmas Day, 2009 on Channel 4 (to tie in with Piper giving the Alternative Christmas Message) and twice on More4 (in early November and late December, each a few days after a C4 screening). There was further More4 screening on 13 February 2011 ahead of the release of Piper's book and follow-up series. The film was broadcast to viewers in Wales on the now-defunct analogue service of S4C on 15 November 2009 at midnight: digital viewers in Wales had access to the Channel 4 and More4 broadcasts.|$|E
500|$|... "Dog Eat Dog" [...] is a style {{parody of}} the Talking Heads. Described as a [...] "tongue-in-cheek look at office life", the song was {{inspired}} by Yankovic's past experience of working in the mailrooms {{as well as the}} traffic department at Westwood One radio station. He noted, [...] "At first I thought [...] was kinda cool that I had a phone and a desk and a little cubicle to call my own, but after a while I felt like my soul had been sucked out of me." [...] The song features a line directly parodying the Talking Heads song [...] "Once In a Lifetime": [...] "Sometimes I tell myself, this is not <b>my</b> <b>beautiful</b> stapler/Sometimes I tell myself this is not <b>my</b> <b>beautiful</b> chair!" [...] This mirrors a similar line in the Talking Heads song: [...] "You may tell yourself, this is not <b>my</b> <b>beautiful</b> house/You may tell yourself, this is not <b>my</b> <b>beautiful</b> wife".|$|E
