40|$|Abstract—Topography is {{fundamental}} to numerous environ-mental studies for understanding Earth surface processes. With a near global coverage, satellite lidar Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) onboard Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satel-lite (ICESat) provides valuable terrain elevation information via Gaussian decomposition of its waveforms. It is commonly assumed that the lowest decomposed Gaussian peak corresponds to terrain surface. Although this assumption is valid over flat areas with sparse canopy, it might be problematic over sloped areas with surface objects. This letter proposes a new algorithm to estimate ground elevation over mountainous vegetated areas using GLAS data in conjunction with Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission Digital Elevation Models (SRTM DEMs). It was found that in-corporating SRTM DEM can reduce the bias of the <b>mean</b> <b>ground</b> <b>elevation</b> estimates by up to 1 – 3 m. This letter also suggests that {{more research is needed}} for improving ground elevation estimates over mountainous areas with relatively open canopy...|$|E
40|$|The Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) is an airborne, wide-swath, digitization-only laser {{altimeter}} {{capable of}} collecting full return waveforms (i. e. echoes) from laser footprints ranging in diameter from 1 to 80 m across up to a 1 km wide data swath. The return waveform {{can be used}} to enhance the accuracy of laser ranging and to provide information about the vertical structure of vegetation and topography within each laser footprint. Although extremely small laser footprints (< 1 0 cm diameter) generally return simple, impulse responses to their target surface, larger footprints typically exhibit complex returns representing the diverse vertical distributions of surfaces contained in each footprint. Only a handful of airborne and spaceborne laser altimeters record the return echo or return pulse that is reflected from the Earth's surface (i. e. NASA's LVIS, SLA, VCL, and GLAS laser altimeters). Waveforms are currently interpreted to extract a timing or ranging point or points to represent the <b>mean</b> <b>ground</b> <b>elevation</b> or the vertical height of vegetation. But, recent progress using pulse shape correlation techniques shows promise for a variety of science applications involving change detection of surface topography and vegetation as well as potential for improving data processing by correlating images or crossovers to solve systematic biases. We show example correlation images from LVIS and discuss instrument design implications and potential science applications...|$|E
40|$|Laser {{altimetry}} (LIDAR) data must {{be processed}} {{to generate a}} digital elevation model (DEM), a digital map of the terrain surface. The raw LIDAR points can be processed and then gridded to form {{a map of the}} ground surface. For example, a waveform generated by binning a set of points over a limited region can be decomposed into a set of Gaussian components. The component with the lowest <b>mean</b> represents the <b>ground</b> <b>elevation.</b> The data contributing to the lowest component is then gridded to form the final DEM. The LIDAR data can be gridded to form different digital images and then the images are processed to create a map of the ground surface. A common and simple technique uses varying window sizes and thresholds at each pixel of the image. This can produce good results when properly tweaked but with very little statistical justification. Anisotropic Diffusion Pyramids' (ADPs) ability to preserve edge information while smoothing homogenous regions can be useful for segmenting buildings or areas of vegetation which need to be removed. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{island of}} Rhodes is {{situated}} in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea in the SE margin of the Aegean Archipelago. It exhibits a semi-mountainous and mountainous morphology {{as well as a}} number of small valleys where various agricultural activities take place. North of the island of Rhodes and in a small distance from it the land of Asia minor is extended while sea waters with greatly varying depths surroud the island. The climate of Rhodos belongs to the Mediterranean type which is characterized by two climatically contrasting periods that is, one cold and rainy lasting from November to March and another warm and dry lasting from April to October (MARIOLOPOULOS,E. and KARAPIPERIS,L., 1963). Althought the mediterranean climate in its main features shows everywhere a characteristic uniformity, it presents many variations in its particular characteristics due to macro and especially to meso and microclimatic factors (DIKAIAKOS,J., 1982). These variations tend to become more pronounced in mountainous regions, valleys and highlands inland the coasts and more weak in long and open to the sea coastal regions as well as in small islands with low <b>mean</b> <b>ground</b> <b>elevation.</b> The geographical position of Rhodes, the land masses of Asia Minor, the extensive sea waters, the shape and size of the semi-mountainous and mountainous morphology with the existing valleys of the island of Rhodes are the main physical and geographical factors which affect the climatic conditions of the island very much during all seasons of the year. The dynamical factors of the climate of Rhodes in the other hand are mainly the depressions coming from North Atlantic, Gulf of Lion, North Adriatic Sea as well as the ones which develop in the coasts of Tynisia, Tripolis and some times over the Aegean Sea and the greater area of Cyprus. The Siberian anticyclone, the one of the Atlantic, as well as the anticyclones which are developed over the west and central Europe are also considered as main dynamical factors affecting the climate o...|$|E
40|$|Discrete {{return and}} {{waveform}} lidar have demonstrated a capability to measure vegetation height {{and the associated}} structural attributes such as aboveground biomass and carbon storage. Since discrete return lidar (DRL) is mainly suitable for small scale studies and the only existing spaceborne lidar sensor (ICESat-GLAS) has been decommissioned, the current question is {{what the future holds}} in terms of large scale lidar remote sensing studies. The earliest planned future spaceborne lidar mission is ICESat- 2, which will use a photon counting technique. To pre-validate the capability of this mission for studying three dimensional vegetation structure in savannas, we assessed the potential of the measurement approach to estimate canopy height in a typical savanna landscape. We used data from the Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental Lidar (MABEL), an airborne photon counting lidar sensor developed by NASA Goddard. MABEL fires laser pulses in the green (532 nm) and near infrared (1064 nm) bands at a nominal repetition rate of 10 kHz and records the travel time of individual photons that are reflected back to the sensor. The photons’ time of arrival and the instrument’s GPS positions and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) orientation are used to calculate the distance the light travelled and hence the elevation of the surface below. A few transects flown over the Tejon ranch conservancy in Kern County, California, USA were used for this work. For each transect we extracted the data from one near infrared channel that had the highest number of photons. We segmented each transect into 50 m, 25 m and 10 m long blocks and aggregated the photons in each block into a histogram based on their elevation values. We then used an expansion window algorithm to identify cut off points where the cumulative density of photons from the highest elevation resembles the canopy top and likewise where such cumulative density from the lowest elevation resembles <b>mean</b> <b>ground</b> <b>elevation.</b> These cut off points were compared to DRL derived canopy and mean ground elevations. The correlation between MABEL and DRL derived metrics ranged from R 2 = 0. 70, RMSE = 7. 9 m to R 2 = 0. 83, RMSE = 2. 9 m. Overall, the results were better when analysis was done at smaller block sizes, mainly due to the large variability of terrain relief associated with increased block size. However, the increase in accuracy was more dramatic when block size was reduced from 50 m to 25 m than it was from 25 m to 10 m. Our work has demonstrated the capability of photon counting lidar to estimate canopy height in savannas at MABEL's signal and noise levels. However, analysis of the Advanced Topography Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) sensor on ICESat- 2 indicate that signal photons will be substantially lower than those of MABEL while sensor noise will vary as a function of solar illumination, altitude and declination, as well as the topographic and reflectance properties of surfaces. Therefore, there are reasons to believe that the actual data from ICESat- 2 will give poorer results due to a lower sampling rate and use of only the green wavelength. Further analysis using simulated ATLAS data are required before more definitive results are possible, and these analyses are ongoing...|$|E

40|$|Over {{three million}} {{hectares}} of salt-affected soils characterized with high salinity and sodicity caused serious land degradation in Songnen Plain, northeast China. Soil salinity–sodicity heterogeneous distribution under microtopography is usually influenced by several environmental factors. The side direction movement of soil water driven by water from depression {{is the key}} factor that aggravates the soil salinization under microtopography in dry condition. In this study, the differences in surface soil salinity–sodicity (0 – 10 cm) between dry year and wet year were compared, {{and the relationship between}} soil salinity–sodicity and environment factors such as <b>ground</b> <b>elevation,</b> surface ponding time, surface ponding depth, and soil moisture at four soil layers (0 – 10, 10 – 30, 30 – 60, and 60 – 100 cm) were analyzed using redundancy analysis (RDA) and simple correlation analysis (Pearson analysis) for two different hydrological years. Analyzed soil salinity–sodicity parameters include soluble ions (Na+, K+, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, CO 32 −, HCO 3 −, Cl− and SO 42 −), salt content (SC), electrical conductivity (EC), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), and pH. Results showed that values of SAR, Cl−, and SO 42 − were significantly higher in dry year than in wet year, while Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, K+, and HCO 3 − showed the opposite results. Values of Na+, CO 32 −, and EC were significantly higher at higher <b>ground</b> <b>elevation</b> gradient (20 – 40 cm) in dry year than wet year. Redundancy analysis indicated that spatial distributions and variations of salinity and sodicity in surface soil layer were related with environmental factors of ponding depth, ponding time and <b>ground</b> <b>elevation</b> in wet year, and they were related with <b>ground</b> <b>elevation,</b> ponding depth, ponding time, and soil moisture at 30 – 60 and 60 – 100 cm soil layer in dry year.

The environmental factors were <b>ground</b> <b>elevation,</b> surface ponding time, surface ponding depth, and soil moistures at four layers (0 – 10 cm, 10 – 30 cm, 30 – 60 cm, and 60 – 100 cm).

Four salinization parameters showed strongly spatial autocorrelation resulting from the compound impact of structural factors. The empirical semivariograms in the four parameters could be simulated by spherical and exponential models. The spatial distributions of SC, EC, SAR and pH showed similar patterns, with the coexistence of high salinity and sodicity in the areas with high <b>ground</b> <b>elevation.</b> By Pearson analysis, the soil salinization parameters showed a significant positive relationship with <b>ground</b> <b>elevation,</b> but a negative correlation with surface ponding time, surface ponding depth, and soil moistures.
