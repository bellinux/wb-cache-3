40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>metioprim,</b> a new competitive inhibitor {{of bacterial}} dihydrofolate reductases, were studied after a single oral dose of 100 mg in two young healthy subjects, four elderly volunteers, and eight patients with impaired renal function. The pharmacokinetic parameters of unchanged <b>metioprim</b> were derived by analyzing plasma level curves using a two-compartment model. Plasma half-lives determined for the beta phase were 10. 5 to 11. 5 h in young volunteers, 12. 0 to 12. 9 h in elderly subjects, and 13. 2 to 15. 3 h {{in patients with}} renal impairment. A significant correlation between the overall elimination rate constant and the creatinine clearance was demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|The {{activities}} of the 2, 4 -diamino- 5 -benzylpyrimidines brodimoprim and <b>metioprim</b> against anaerobic bacteria were tested alone and in combination with sulfonamides. Alone they were two to four times more active than trimethoprim, but in combination with sulfonamides, their activity was slightly {{lower than that of}} trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole...|$|E
