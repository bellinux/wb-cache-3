50|$|Casting {{urethanes}} {{is similar}} in that polyurethanes are injected into a tool. But with cast urethanes, the tool is a soft tool, typically made with a type of silicone mold. The mold is created via a master pattern. <b>Master</b> <b>patterns</b> for cast urethanes can be created with CNC machining (which is a common process for injection molding) but cast urethane <b>master</b> <b>patterns</b> are often created with additive manufacturing (or 3D Printing) {{and the reasons for}} this vary.|$|E

5000|$|Create a mould: A mould, {{known as}} the master die, is made to fit the <b>master</b> <b>pattern.</b> If the <b>master</b> <b>pattern</b> was made from steel, the master die can be cast {{directly}} from the pattern using metal with a lower melting point.

50|$|In {{moving up}} to a greater {{production}} scale, laboratory processing steps {{such as the use}} of electron beam lithography are slow and expensive. Therefore, a roll-to-roll manufacturing method was devised using a new manufacturing technique based on a <b>master</b> <b>pattern.</b> This <b>master</b> <b>pattern</b> in effect mechanically “stamps” the precision pattern onto an inexpensive flexible substrate and thereby creates the metallic loop elements seen in the laboratory processing steps. The master template fabricated by Idaho National Laboratories consists of approximately 10 billion antenna elements on an 8-inch round silicon wafer. Using this semi-automated process, Idaho National Labs has produced a number of 4-inch square coupons. These coupons were combined to form a broad flexible sheet of antenna arrays. This work did not include production of the diode component.|$|R

Solid Concepts incorporates their CNC machining centers {{for the production}} of <b>Master</b> <b>Patterns</b> for QuantumCast Cast Urethane products that may require a long mold life.*Stereolithography/ 3D Printing: SLA is the technology that started the company back in 1991. SLA is used to create prototypes, <b>master</b> <b>patterns</b> for investment casting, patterns for cast urethanes, art, and more. As it is a photocurable liquid resin process, the company is able to build large parts by bonding smaller segments. PolyJet is used in similar functions requiring tighter tolerances and smaller builds. SLS and FDM are 3D Printing processes that afford high quality plastics viable in end-use products, while also being used for prototypes. DMLS is viable for metal parts requiring geometries that cannot easily be milled.|$|E

The master pattern is used to create an A side and a B side for a mold. The pattern is used to form a void within a mold.

5000|$|... 3D Systems, {{headquartered}} in Rock Hill, South Carolina, {{is a company}} that engineers, manufactures and sells 3D printers. Chuck Hull, currently the CTO and former president, invented stereolithography in 1986. [...] 3D Systems creates product concept models, precision and functional prototypes, <b>master</b> <b>patterns</b> for tooling, as well as production parts for direct digital manufacturing. 3D Systems uses proprietary processes to fabricate physical objects using input from computer-aided design and manufacturing software, or 3D scanning and 3D sculpting devices.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{advantages}} of stereolithography is its speed; functional parts can be manufactured within a day. The length of time it takes to produce a single part depends upon the complexity of the design and the size. Printing time can last anywhere from hours to more than a day. Many 3D printers can produce parts with a maximum size of approximately 50×50×60 cm (20×20×24 in) and some printers are capable of producing single parts more than 2 meters in length. 3D printed prototypes and designs are strong enough to be machined and {{can also be used to}} make <b>master</b> <b>patterns</b> for injection molding, thermoforming, blow molding, and various metal casting processes.|$|E

These were placed on a stack of tissue paper and cut around with a sharp knife; after all the pieces of each pattern were cut out, the tissue paper pieces were sorted, folded together and labeled with {{an image of the}} garment and brief instructions. Butterick offered precut patterns of this type until the late 1940s, when they began to produce uncut, printed patterns (as sold today). The patterns were offered one size to a package until the 1980s, when slower sales made [...] "multisized" [...] patterns (which had several different sizes in the same package) more cost effective.|$|E
5000|$|Stereolithography, or SLA, {{was invented}} by 3D Systems’ founder Chuck Hull. Stereolithography {{describes}} the method and apparatus for making solid objects in a vat of liquid photopolylmer using ultraviolet curable material and a laser to trace the digital design. SLA systems print with supports and are advantageous due to the speed and possible size of prints (size depends on the build volume of the particular machine). SLA systems can also rapidly manufacture parts of different geometries {{at the same time}} and are designed to produce prototypes, patterns or end-use parts of versatile sizes and applications. SLA parts are strong enough to be machined and can be used as <b>master</b> <b>patterns</b> for injection molding, thermoforming, blow molding and various metal casting processes.|$|E

30|$|The {{previous}} fabrication strategy {{relied on}} costly e-beam lithography [7], whereas molding technologies, such as nanoimprinting, have emerged {{due to high}} throughput and cost-effective process capabilities [5, 8 – 16]. <b>Master</b> <b>patterns</b> required for molding can be fabricated by e-beam [5], interference lithography [8, 9], anodizing aluminum oxide [10, 11], colloidal nanolithography using polystyrene [12 – 14], and electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) plasma etching [15, 16].
