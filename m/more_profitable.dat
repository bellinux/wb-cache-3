40|$|We {{investigate}} how {{the presence of}} capacity constraints affects the advance-booking strategy of a service provider. In particular, we identify the capacity levels un-der which fully refundable bookings are <b>more</b> (less) <b>profitable</b> than non-refundable bookings. As in the unconstrained capacity models, we find that if the capacity is sufficiently high (low) a full-refund booking strategy is <b>more</b> (less) <b>profitable</b> than a non-refundable booking strategy. For very restrictive capacity levels, the firm will never utilize a fully refundable booking. Otherwise, a dual booking strategy that segments {{the market in the}} refundability dimension is profit maximizing...|$|R

5|$|Arthur Lennig {{asserted}} that MGM's official budget for Greed was suspiciously high {{for a film}} with no stars, no built sets, a small crew and inexpensive film stock. Lennig suspects that MGM averaged the film's cost with the more expensive The Merry Widow {{in order to prevent}} von Stroheim from getting a percentage of the <b>more</b> <b>profitable</b> film. The Merry Widow ended up being a hit and earned more profits than Greed had lost; it cost $614,961 but earned $996,226 on its initial run.|$|E

Moreover, the eight tracks recorded in May for Deep Purple's debut album and performed live in the British gigs of July and August were deemed insufficient for their shows as headliners in the US. For these reasons, they were pushed back into the studio just a couple of months before the tour began, even though their debut album had not been released in the United Kingdom yet.|$|E

Surfing Magazine printed a pictorial of Kymberly Herrin, Playboy Playmate March 1981, surfing in a revealing bikini, and eventually started an annual bikini issue. The Association of Surfing Professionals often pairs female surf meets with bikini contests, an issue that divides the female pro-surfing community into two parts.

5|$|The City of Ashland {{moved to}} improve local {{broadband}} Internet access {{in the late}} 1990s by creating the Ashland Fiber Network (AFN) and building a fiber optic ring inside the city boundaries. However, by 2006 the city faced difficulties servicing AFN's debt load, which was approaching $15.5million. The city hired a new AFN director, Joe Franell, who suggested scrapping cable television service while retaining the <b>more</b> <b>profitable</b> high-speed Internet access. In October 2006, the cable television service was transferred to a local company, Ashland Home Net, while the City retained both the infrastructure and the wholesale Internet business.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth in}} Commercial Air Transport (CAT) has eroded the {{operational}} freedom of GA, {{both in the}} air and on the ground at larger airports. Difficulty with access to larger airports is compounded by a {{decline in the number of}} aerodromes generally, and existing sites are often threatened with closure and re-development for <b>more</b> <b>profitable</b> uses. The UK planning system is designed to focus on local issues, and consideration of the national impact of GA operations is not within its remit. This makes aerodrome development difficult, often subjecting those that successfully negotiate the process to restrictions in use.|$|E

Between 1997 and 1999, the company spun off several well-loved but poorly selling campaign settings (including Planescape, Dark Sun and Spelljammer) to fan groups, focusing business primarily on the <b>more</b> <b>profitable</b> Greyhawk and Forgotten Realms lines.|$|E

5|$|A 2002 study {{conducted}} by CARE International across three districts in the Central Region of Malawi considers how HIV/AIDS has affected economic well-being in rural Malawi. When skilled laborers are infected with HIV, they are usually unable to work; therefore, they often shift agricultural production on their land to less labor-intensive crops, sacrificing the opportunity to grow <b>more</b> <b>profitable,</b> labor-intensive crops such as tobacco. When family members fall ill with HIV/AIDS, their relatives invest time in their treatment and care, further reducing household productivity. In addition, when family members are infected with HIV, households often use the money they would normally invest in agriculture to cover medical expenses, further decreasing economic stability at the household level. Finally, when adults contract HIV, their children often remain home from school {{to work in the}} fields, threatening long-term productivity and economic advancement in Malawi.|$|E

While in office it was difficult to practice law being away in Washington part of the year, and his plantation was also <b>more</b> <b>profitable</b> when Tyler was available to manage it himself. By the time he entered the Senate in 1827, he had resigned himself to spending part of the year away from his family. Still, he sought to remain close to his children through letters.|$|E
