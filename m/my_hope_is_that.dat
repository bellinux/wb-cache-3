On February 9, 2010, the First Lady announced Let's Move! and President Barack Obama created the Task Force on Childhood Obesity to review all current programs and create a national plan towards change. Michelle Obama stated that her goal was to make this effort her legacy: [...] "I want to leave something behind that we can say, 'Because of this time that this person spent here, this thing has changed.' And <b>my</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> that's {{going to be in}} the area of childhood obesity." [...] Her 2012 book [...] is based on her experiences with the garden and promotes healthy eating. Her call for action on healthy eating has been echoed by the United States Department of Defense, which has been facing an ever-expanding problem of recruit obesity.|$|E
500|$|The {{ceremony}} was opened by Dobriansky {{followed by a}} rendition of the U.S. national anthem, [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner". [...] Senyshyn then read the invocation in English and Ukrainian and Roman Smal-Stocki, president of the memorial committee, spoke {{about the significance of}} the monument. [...] Perhaps the most prominent attendee was former U.S. President Eisenhower, who was chosen to unveil the statue. [...] Before he did so, Eisenhower was cheered for several minutes as the crowd chanted [...] "We Like Ike!" [...] Following a 12-minute speech, Eisenhower unveiled the statue, calling Shevchenko a Ukrainian hero and stated: [...] "For <b>my</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> your magnificent march from the shadow of the Washington Monument {{to the foot of the}} statue of Shevchenko will here kindle a new world movement in the hearts, minds, words and actions of men; a never-ending movement dedicated to the independence and freedom of peoples of all captive nations of the entire world." [...] He also said the statue represented [...] "millions of oppressed" [...] in Eastern Europe and [...] "gives them constant encouragement to struggle forever against Communist tyranny, until, one day final victory is achieved, as it most surely will be." [...] Following the unveiling, the Ukrainian Choral Societies of America led the crowd in a musical rendition of Shevchenko's poem [...] [...] Additional speeches were then made by several U.S. Representatives and Archbishop Ioan Theodorovych of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church gave the benediction. [...] The ceremony concluded with the crowd singing Ukraine's national anthem, Shche ne vmerla Ukraina (English: Ukraine Has Not Yet Died).|$|E

I should be very sorry that any part of my {{behaviour}} should give you cause to suppose that I think higher of myself, or otherwise of you than I have always done. I can assure you that I am as much the humblest of your servants as at Trin. Coll.; and if I have not been at home when you favoured me with a call, the loss was more mine than yours. In the bustle of buzzing parties, there is, there can be, no rational conversation; but when I can enjoy it, there is nobody's I can prefer to your own.|$|E

She wanted to know if I could give her any advice about getting work, when she thought she could do it well enough; but of course I know nothing about such things. <b>My</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> she will get to dislike that as much as she does nursing and apothecary work, and to find out that her real duty is to live like an ordinary human being, and so make herself and other people truly happy." ...|$|E

Yonder Despard will not live long, he drinks too hard; and then your day may come, if you still care for his leavings--perhaps in two years, perhaps in less, for she will soon see him out.

"When {{one gets}} to my age, Ronald, common sense takes {{the place of}} enthusiasm, and I have seen enough of wars to know that for {{business}} a well appointed and well disciplined army is required. If Prince Charles does get what you call an army, but which I should call an armed mob, together, there will be the same dissensions, the same bickerings, the same want of plan that there was before; and unless something like a miracle happens it will end as the last did at Preston, in defeat and ruin. However, lad, here we are, and we will go through with it to the end. By the time we get back to France we must hope that King Louis will have got over the killing of his favourite. However, I tell you frankly that <b>my</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> when the Highland chiefs see that the prince has come without arms, without men, and without even promises of support by France, they will refuse to risk liberty and life and to bring ruin upon their people by joining in such a mad brained adventure." ...|$|E

It will be terrible to bear the disgrace alone, but it would be ten times more so did it involve another in my disgrace. Do not pain me by saying more, Captain Armstrong,' and she laid her hand on his arm {{as he was about to}} speak, 'nothing could induce me to change my determination.

6000|$|Twenty {{days later}} he was {{defending}} his intemperate publication to another queen - his own queen, Mary Stuart. This was {{on the first of}} those three interviews which he has preserved for us with so much dramatic vigour in the picturesque pages of his history. After he had avowed the authorship in his usual haughty style, Mary asked: [...] "You think, then, that I have no just authority?" [...] The question was evaded. [...] "Please your Majesty," [...] he answered, [...] "that learned men in all ages have had their judgments free, and most commonly disagreeing from the common judgment of the world; such also have they published by pen and tongue; and yet notwithstanding they themselves have lived in the common society with others, and have borne patiently with the errors and imperfections which they could not amend." [...] Thus did [...] "Plato the philosopher:" [...] thus will do John Knox. [...] "I have communicated my judgment to the world: if the realm finds no inconvenience from the regiment of a woman, that which they approve, shall I not further disallow than within my own breast; but shall be as well content to live under your Grace, as Paul was to live under Nero. And <b>my</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> so long as ye defile not your hands with the blood of the saints of God, neither I nor my book shall hurt either you or your authority." [...] All this is admirable in wisdom and moderation, and, except that he might have hit upon a comparison less offensive than that with Paul and Nero, hardly to be bettered. Having said thus much, he feels he needs say no more; and so, when he is further pressed, he closes that part of the discussion with an astonishing sally. If he has been content to let this matter sleep, he would recommend her Grace to follow his example with thankfulness of heart; it is grimly to be understood which of them has most to fear if the question should be reawakened. So the talk wandered to other subjects. Only, when the Queen was summoned at last to dinner ("for it was afternoon") Knox made his salutation in this form of words: [...] "I pray God, Madam, that you may be as much blessed within the Commonwealth of Scotland, if it be the pleasure of God, as ever Deborah was in the Commonwealth of Israel." [...] (1) Deborah again.|$|E

It also contributes to more effective relationships among all school community members. Principals and teachers need to build trusting relationships with students and parents in order to accomplish their essential goal of fostering student achievement and equipping students for citizenship. ^ In the context of organizational/relational trust, this study explored such relationships with fifteen purposefully-selected, Latino students and their parents. <b>My</b> <b>hope</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> these families would openly and honestly share their thoughts regarding one suburban public high school system‚Äôs ability to adequately partner with them in building trusting relationships necessary to better meet the academic needs of their sons and daughters.
