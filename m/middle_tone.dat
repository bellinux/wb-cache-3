During the 1860s, Monet and Renoir sometimes painted on canvases prepared with the traditional red-brown or grey ground.

5000|$|Although most {{words are}} shared between Thai, Isan, and Lao, {{problems}} in understanding can arise as tone is a phonemic feature {{in all three}} speech varieties. Standard Thai has five tones, although Lao dialects have anywhere from five to seven. [...] The Thai word กา, ka ( [...] is pronounced with a <b>middle</b> <b>tone</b> in Standard Thai, based on the speech of Bangkok. In Laos, the cognate ກາ, ka (...) , is low-falling in Standard Lao, based on the speech of Vientiane. In other Lao dialects, the same word could be pronounced with a low, rising, or high tone. In context, this presents few challenges, but a word out of context could be mistaken for other words. Tone in Thai determined by complex rules determined by consonant tone class, presence of tone markers, and vowel type. Since these rules are catering to Thai tonal patterns, they are deficient for representing Isan speech and their distinct tonal patterns.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} reflected-light {{exposure meters}} were wide-angle, averaging types, measuring the average scene luminance. Exposure meter calibration {{was chosen to}} result in the “best” exposures for typical outdoor scenes; when measuring a single scene element (such as {{the side of a}} building in open shade), the indicated exposure is in the approximate middle of the film or electronic sensor's exposure range. When measuring a scene with atypical distribution of light and dark elements, or a single element that is lighter or darker than a <b>middle</b> <b>tone,</b> the indicated exposure may not be optimal. For example, a scene with predominantly light tones (e.g., a white horse) often will be underexposed, while a scene with predominantly dark tones (e.g., a black horse) often will be overexposed. That both scenes require the same exposure, regardless of the meter indication, becomes obvious from a scene that includes both a white horse and a black horse. A photographer usually can recognize the difference between a white horse and a black horse; a meter usually cannot. When metering a white horse, a photographer can apply exposure compensation so that the white horse is rendered as white.|$|E
5000|$|Although Chrysanthos did {{not mention}} his name, the first who {{mentioned}} precisely these proportions starting from the open string of the third or middle chord of the oud, was the Arab theorist Al-Farabi in his Kitab al-Musiqa al-Kabir which was written {{during the first half}} of the 10th century. His explicit references to Persian and Ancient Greek music theory were possible, because they had been recently translated into Arabic and Persian dialects in the library of Baghdad. Thanks to them Al-Farabi had also an excellent knowledge of Ancient Greek music theory. The method of demonstrating the intervals by the frets of the oud keyboard was probably taken from Al-Kindi. Here the intervals are not referred to the Byzantine phthongoi, but to the name of the frets. And the fret corresponding to β was called [...] "ring finger fret of Zalzal" [...] (wuṣtā Zalzal), named after the famous Baghdadi oud player Zalzal. It seems that the proportion of the Zalzal fret was a refined one in Bagdad using a large <b>middle</b> <b>tone</b> that came very close to the interval of the small tone, while the Mawsili school used 13:12 instead of 12:11. There is no indication that this division had been of Byzantine origin, so Western scholars felt seduced to ascribe the use of the division called [...] "soft diatonic" [...] (diatonikos malakos) and the chromaticism derived from it as an influence of the Ottoman Empire and to regard their view of the systema teleion also as a norm for the Byzantine tonal system. As Phanariotes (Phanar was the Greek district of Istanbul with the residence of the Patriarchate) who composed as well in the makamlar, the teachers of the New Music School of the Patriarchate around Chrysanthos had certainly exchanges with Sephardic, Armenian, and Sufi musicians, but an intensive exchange between Byzantine, Arab and Persian musicians had already a history of more than 1000 years.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of age, sex and melodic/harmonic pat-terns on pitch-matching skills of children. Subjects were 128 talented singers, ages 8 - 11, equally divided among boys and girls, who sang 16 pitch-matching patterns; 4 patterns were melodic and 12 were harmonic. In 4 harmonic patterns, the upper tone was matched; in another 4, the lower tone was matched, and in the last set, the <b>middle</b> <b>tone</b> was matched. Two judges recorded correct/incorrect responses across 1, 536 trials with 85 % agreements. Results of a three-factor analysis of variance with repeated measures indicated no differ-ences between age or sex groups and significant differences among pitch-matching tasks. More errors were made on matching the middle pitch of a chord than on any other trials. Singing the lower pitch of two tones was more difficult than matching the higher pitch of two tones or singing back a short melody. A task hierarchy for children's part-singing is sug-gested...|$|E
40|$|Local {{relations}} {{refer to}} adjacent events (such {{as the time}} between successive notes in amelody); global relations refer to a continuous succession of local events (such as the rhythmic timing of the complete series of notes in a melody). Tones in a short auditory sequence can have their perceived timing distorted by local pitch relations. The Tau and Kappa timing effects in visual motion stimuli have equivalent auditory pitch motion versions (Shigeno 1993) where the perceived delay from one tone to the next depends on local pitch separation. We report data which show local distortions in the perceived duration of a sequence of 3 tones where {{the first and last}} tones have one pitch and the <b>middle</b> <b>tone</b> another pitch. Perceived duration increases with the pitch interval between the <b>middle</b> <b>tone</b> and the others: the larger the pitch interval the longer the perceived duration. We report a range of results which allow us to relate this finding to the relative frequency of the melodic intervals in “vernacular” western tonal music: melodic events that are uncommon (such as a pitch change of a major 7 th) are perceived to last longer than identically timed common ones (such as major 2 nd). This local effect suggests that there should be an equivalent global effect: large intervals should tend to make melodies sound slower. However, we also report data showing that melodies with frequent large intervals tend to have their perceptual characteristics (such as happiness/sadness) judged as if the melody is faster (not slower) than melodies without large intervals. This shows a discrepancy between local timing and global timing. This set of findings is difficult to reconcile with any unitary additive model of time perception. We will describe an alternative account of time based on the nature of events. Uncommon events happen less frequently (by definition) and therefore the time between uncommon events will normally be longer that the time between common events. In this sense, uncommon events can be said to dilate the perception of time. When events happen more frequently than usual, a melody sounds rushed...|$|E
