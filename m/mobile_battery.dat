25|$|During 1918 enemy {{air raids}} were {{concentrated}} on London and Norfolk, and the Northern Air Defences were hardly involved. On 19 May, No 9 <b>Mobile</b> <b>Battery,</b> {{operating under the}} Dover AADC, was engaged when 40 Giant and Gotha bombers made the biggest raid of the war; the battery illuminated 24 of these raiders during the night, when eight were shot down. 2nd Lieutenant Metcalf of the TEE, commanding this battery, developed {{a new system of}} height determination, which was adopted throughout the AA defences.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 4 October morale was low amongst the monarchical troops {{stationed}} in Rossio Square, due to the constant danger of being bombarded by the naval forces and not even the Couceiro's batteries, strategically placed there, could bring them comfort. In the headquarters there were discussions about {{the best position to}} bomb the Rotunda. At 3am, Paiva Couceiro departed with a <b>mobile</b> <b>battery,</b> escorted by a municipal guard squad, and positioned himself in Castro Guimarães Garden, in Torel, waiting for daybreak. When the forces in Rotunda began to shoot on Rossio, revealing their position, Paiva Couceiro opened fire, causing casualties and sowing confusion amongst the rebels. The bombardment continued with advantage towards the monarchical side, but at eight in the morning Paiva Couceiro received orders to stop fighting, as there would be an armistice of an hour.|$|E
25|$|Other {{branches}} of the South African National Defence Force also operate several radar systems that can assist the South African Air Force. The South African Navy utilises four Valour-class frigates, {{each of which is}} equipped with the Thales Naval France MRR-3D NG G-band multi-role surveillance/self-defence radar that can detect low and medium-level targets at ranges of up to 140km and in long-range 3D air surveillance mode targets up to 180km. In the self-defence mode, it can detect and track any threat within a radius of 60km. These Frigates can link their data systems to the Link ZA system to help create a broader picture for the armed forces. The South African Army also operates several Reutech Radar Systems (RRS) ESR220 Thutlhwa (Kameelperd/Giraffe) <b>Mobile</b> <b>Battery</b> Fire Control Post Systems. These NATO D-Band radars have a range of 120km and can also be linked to Link ZA to assist air force operations.|$|E

25|$|As soon as {{news of the}} {{concentration}} of rebels in Rotunda were received, the military command of the city organised a detachment to break them up. The column, {{under the command of}} Colonel Alfredo Albuquerque, was formed by units that had been removed from the protection of the Palace of Necessidades: Infantry 2, Cavalry 2 and the <b>mobile</b> <b>battery</b> of Queluz. The latter included the colonial war hero Henrique Mitchell de Paiva Couceiro. The column advanced until near the prison, where it assumed combat positions. However, before these were completed, the column was attacked by rebels. The attack was repelled but resulted in a few wounded men, several dead pack animals and the scattering of about half the infantry. Paiva Couceiro responded with cannons and the infantry that remained during 45 minutes, ordering an attack that was carried out by around 30 soldiers, but which was beaten with some casualties. Continuing the gunfire, he ordered a new attack, but only 20 soldiers followed the order. Thinking that he had found the right time to assault the barracks of Artillery 1, Paiva Couceiro requested reinforcement to the division's command. However, he received the perplexing order to retreat.|$|E
25|$|With {{the arrival}} of the <b>mobile</b> <b>battery</b> from Queluz, the pieces were {{arranged}} in the palace gardens so that they could bombard the quarters of the revolutionary sailors, which were located at no more than 100 metres from the palace. However, before they had time to start, the commander of the battery received the order to cancel the bombing and join the forces that were leaving the palace, integrated into the column that would attack the rebels in Artillery 1 and the Rotunda. At around midday the cruisers Adamastor and São Rafael, which had anchored in front of the sailors' quarters an hour previously, started the bombardment of the Palace of Necessidades, an action which served to demoralise the present monarchical forces. The king took refuge in a small house in the palace's park, where he could ring Teixeira de Sousa, since the revolutionaries had only cut the special state telephone lines and not the general network. The king ordered the prime minister to send the battery from Queluz to the palace to impede the debarkation of the sailors, but the prime minister replied that the main action was happening in Rotunda and all the troops that were there were needed. Taking into account that the available troops were not sufficient to defeat the rebels in Rotunda, the minister made it obvious to the king that it would be more convenient to retire to Sintra or Mafra so that the stationed forces of the palace could reinforce the troops in Rotunda.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to {{determine}} the wear of <b>mobile</b> <b>batteries</b> for different reasons, in particular the effect of reversible and irreversible entropy. processing a set of data from various terminals obtained from the server where all information is stored in real time. First of all, there is a presentation of the general theory explaining briefly the history and the nowadays mobile phones. Moreover, it will also explain some types of phone batteries with a comparison between them. Afterwards, brief description about thermodynamics and the entropy, which the project is based on, will be explained. The following describes the experimental and theoretical methods employed in order to manipulate the data obtained from the server. To handle all the data in the server, a program with language C # was developed, in which you can choose from which mobile you want to obtain information. Then with MATLAB, we have studied the data with different methods in order to reach the conclusion that corroborates the theory that entropy generation is a valid method to characterize the damage induced in the <b>mobile</b> <b>batteries.</b> Finally, a proposal is made for possible future studies as a continuation of this project...|$|R

50|$|If the {{location}} areas are very large, {{there will be}} many mobiles operating simultaneously, resulting in very high paging traffic, as every paging request has to be broadcast to every base station in {{the location}} area. This wastes bandwidth and power on the mobile, by requiring it to listen for broadcast messages too much of the time. If on the other hand, there are too many small location areas, the mobile must contact the network very often for changes of location, which will also drain the <b>mobile's</b> <b>battery.</b> A balance has therefore to be struck.|$|R
50|$|When Italy entered World War II in 1940 it was {{estimated}} that one hundred ten 102/35 guns were still in service. Six were mounted on a navy armored train, which had two carriages each armed with three guns. While others were mounted on anti-aircraft mounts or used as coastal artillery. In 1941 the Fiat plant in Tripoli mounted seven on trucks and were referred to as 102/35 on Fiat 634N. The guns came from defenses around Tripoli and these established the 1st and 6th mobile batteries, manned by men of the Maritime Militia Artillery. The 102/35 guns were used as anti-aircraft guns, anti-tank guns and as field-artillery. The 1st <b>mobile</b> <b>battery</b> was assigned to the 132nd Armoured Division Ariete, while the 6th <b>mobile</b> <b>battery</b> was assigned to the 102nd Motorised Division Trento.|$|E

The attacks caused substantial damage and rendered the bunker unusable for its original purpose. Part of the bunker was subsequently completed for use as a liquid oxygen factory. It was captured by Allied forces at the start of September 1944, though its true purpose was not discovered by the Allies until after the war. V-2s were instead launched from Meillerwagen-based <b>mobile</b> <b>batteries</b> which were far less vulnerable to aerial attacks.|$|R
50|$|On the {{creation}} of the Machine Gun Corps in October 1915, the MMGS was incorporated into it as the Machine Gun Corps (Motors) (MGC(M)). Most MGC(M) batteries on the Western Front were disbanded in the course of 1916. Nevertheless, the surviving <b>mobile</b> <b>batteries</b> eventually came into their own during the advances of 1918, as well as in other theatres of the war, notably Palestine, Mesopotamia and East Africa. From 1916, many men of the MGC(M) were transferred to the Heavy Section, MGC, which later became the Tank Corps; and in 1922, the Tank Corps absorbed all remaining units of the MGC(M).|$|R
