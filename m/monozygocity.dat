50|$|Twin {{studies are}} a helpful tool in {{determining}} the heritability of disorders and human traits in general. They involve determining concordance of characteristics between identical (monozygotic or MZ) twins and between fraternal (dizygotic or DZ) twins. Possible problems of twin studies are: (1) errors in diagnosis of <b>monozygocity,</b> and (2) the assumption that social environment sharing by DZ twins is equivalent to that of MZ twins.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To prove <b>monozygocity</b> {{of human}} twin blastocysts derived from embryo {{splitting}} at the cleavage stage. Methods: Human triploid embryos at the 6 – 8 cell stage were split into twin embryos (D and R) and cultured in vitro to the blastocyst stage. Twin embryos were processed for nested multiplex PCR using fluorescently labeled primers of six selected polymorphic STR markers within the human HLA locus. Results: A total of 11 pairs of twin embryos were analyzed with PCR technology. From five pairs of twin blastocysts, the fluorograms provided detectable STR profiles for identical peak position between the twin embryos. Conclusion: This {{is the first}} report on twinned human embryos to prove <b>monozygocity</b> at the DNA level. Embryo splitting exhibits novel potential for future applications in assisted reproductive medicine...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{evaluation}} of the diagnosis, management and outcome of a pair of heterokaryotypic monozygotic dichorionic twins. The heterokaryotype was an incidental finding from an amniocentesis performed for prenatal diagnosis of β-thalassaemia major in a pair of dichorionic twins. <b>Monozygocity</b> was revealed by QF-PCR showing identical short tandem repeat markers on chromosomes 21, 18, 13, X and Y. The twins were heterokaryotypic for duplication chromosome 2 q 13 -q 23. 3, as shown by array comparative genomic hybridization. Selective foeticide was performed. This case demonstrates that heterokaryotypic monozygotic dichorionic twins are a genetic possibility that does occur. Copyright © 2009 S. Karger AG. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} factors predisposing for {{inhibitor}} development in haemophilia patients is still largely unresolved. In {{an attempt to}} address this problem, we initiated a registry in 1996 of siblings with haemophilia and {{with or without a}} history of inhibitors. Four hundred and sixty families have accrued, of whom 388 suffer from haemophilia A and 72 haemophilia B. Twenty-five of the brother pairs are twins. The inhibitor incidence in all families with severe haemophilia A was 31. 7 %. The corresponding figure in the caucasian patients was 27. 4 %, whereas a higher incidence of inhibitors was reported in the black subjects (55. 6 %). Twins were reported in six of the 100 inhibitor families, for whom <b>monozygocity</b> was confirmed in three cases. In 32 families (32 %), at least two brothers had a history of inhibitors. In 22 (69 %) of these families, the inhibitor was also of the same type, i. e. either high- or low-responding. The overall concordance within the severe haemophilia A families was found to be 78. 3 % (195 / 249) compared to an expected figure of 68. 0 % and 58. 0 % using an inhibitor incidence of 20 and 30 %, respectively (P < 0. 0001). The corresponding figure for the twins was 88. 2 % (15 / 17). Moreover, the risk for inhibitor development in families with a previous inhibitor history was found to be 48 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 35 - 62 %), whereas the risk in families with no previous known inhibitor was only 15 % (95 % CI 11 - 21 %) corresponding to a relative risk of 3. 2 (95 % CI 2. 1 - 4. 9). Immune-tolerance induction was reported in 24 families, of whom 13 siblings were successfully treated. Our data clearly support the concept that a genetic predisposition for inhibitor development exists. However, the markers of this predisposition remain to be elucidated and we believe that the MIBS registry will be useful for this purpose...|$|E
