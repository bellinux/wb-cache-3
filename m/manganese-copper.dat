The main appropriatenesses of the structure formation of the high-damping <b>manganese-copper</b> alloys under annealing at 400 degrees C are detected. The structure mechanisms of formation of the damping properties in the manganse-copper alloys with fcc (face-centered cubic) and fct (face-centered tetragonal) structure are developed.

40|$|Pulse plating of <b>manganese-copper</b> alloys from a {{sulphate}} solution {{with the}} addition of ammonium sulphate at pH 6 - 7 has been studied. The Mn-Cu electrodeposition system is characterised by steady state and transient electrokinetic methods. The influence of pulse current on cathodic efficiency, microstructure and morphology of the deposits was analysed and compared with the results achieved with continuous current. When short off-times are applied, a uniform and homogeneous morphology is obtained. All the deposits exhibit suitable mechanical properties and low copper content (< 5 wt-%). The codeposition of copper prevents the phase transformation of as deposited ductile γ-Mn to the brittle and hard α-Mn for up to a few months...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{have been}} made of damping {{behaviour}} under conditions of combined stress (i. e., biaxial loading) for six high damping metals-two alloys of <b>manganese-copper</b> and four grades of cast iron. Measured values of damping are presented from tests covering a range of combined stress states and the damping behaviour is interpreted in terms of dependence on stress state. The measured values were obtained from a new experiment in which various combined stress conditions are generated by coupled torsion/bending vibration of a cantilever. The range covered is from all torsion to all bending, i. e., principal stress ratios from - 1 to 0. Damping is determined from energy input during steady state resonant vibration, but frequency response and free decay methods can also be used. Details of the apparatus are given...|$|E
40|$|Approved for Public release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis paper presents the studies on measurement techniques {{developed for the}} determination of strain-dependent damping characteristics of materials in an air environment. The material is a high damping <b>manganese-copper</b> alloy called Sonoston. The measurement techniques employ cantilevercd flat beam specimens in bending and cylindrical specimens in torsion. The specimens were subjected to three different heat and aging treatments. Pure random and sinusoidal sweep excitations are used as an excitation source in the frequency range of 20 to 500 Hz. Miniature acceleromcters and strain gages were mounted on the specimens to obtain both input excitation and output responses. The {{results of the investigation}} are presented graphically as damping factor vs. resonant frequency, damping factor vs. strain, damping factor vs. input acceleration, strain vs. resonant frequency, strain vs. input acceleration, and input acceleration vs. resonant frequency.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, mixed <b>manganese-copper</b> ferrite of {{composition}} MnxCu 1 -xFe 2 O 4 (within x= 0. 40, 0. 42, 0. 44, 0. 46, 0. 48 and 0. 50) {{have been investigated}} for their electric and magnetic properties such as dc resistivity, Curie temperature, saturation magnetization. MnxCu 1 -xFe 2 O 4 ferrite samples were prepared by uniaxial pressing from the oxide mixture, synthesized at 1000 °C during 45 hours and finally heated to 1200 °C by 5 h, at room atmosphere. The X-ray diffractograms show that the samples with different compositions were formed by compact structure spinel with cubic cell. The saturated magnetization of the MnxCu 1 -xFe 2 O 4 ferrites increased with x up to 0. 46, which presented the smallest coercitive field. All samples showed hysteresis characteristic of soft magnetic materials. This electrical behavior is compatible with an insulator.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedTwo commercial <b>manganese-copper</b> based alloys, SONOSTON and INCRAMUTE, were evaluated {{for their ability}} to maintain optimum damping capacity with time when stored at room temperature and 100 °C, which represents a temperature range within which marine equipment commonly operate. Damping measurements were obtained using the modified resonant dwell technique. Significant degradation occurs within 12 days in both alloys when stored at room temperature or 100 °C, although SONOSTON stored at 100 °C exhibited stable damping in the active strain range. Recovery treatments at 125 °C indicated that a recovery mechanism was operative in INCRAMUTE, but absent in SONOSTON. In fact a 125 °C recovery treatment actually appeared to degrade damping in the active strain range in SONOSTON. X-ray diffraction results indicated that the changing damping characteristics were unrelated to lattice changes detectable by that technique. Transmission electron microscopy revealed an unique contour "jumping" phenomena with electron beam heating, which is hypothesized to indicate a sensitive elastic transformation, with a low strain threshold, of the tweed microstructure. In addition, although not quantitatively evaluated, a modulus discontinuity with time was observed upon initially vibrating cantilevers beam specimens, possibly related to the necessity to activate the damping mechanism of the tweed microstructure.

40|$|THESIS 7941 The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis lies within the general area of supramolecular and coordination chemistry. The work herein {{can be divided into}} two distinct areas. Firstly, the syntheses and structural characterisation of o-phenylenebis(oxamides) and related ligands are described and secondly, the preparation and characterisation of novel transition metal complexes incorporating some of these ligands is reported. Chapter 2 details the synthesis of novel ligands that are related to o-phenylenebis(oxamate) L 1, C 14 N 2 O 6 H 16 : (L 1), C 12 N 2 O 6 H 12 (L 2), C 12 N 4 O 4 H 14 (L 3), C 15 N 2 O 6 H 18 (L 4), C 13 N 4 O 4 H 16 (L 5), C 16 N 2 O 6 H 20 (L 6), C 14 N 4 O 4 H 18 (L 7), C 14 N 2 O 6 H 16 (L 8), C 14 N 2 O 6 H 16 (L 9), C 21 N 2 O 6 H 22 (L 10) and C 30 N 5 O 4 H 52 (L 22) ]. The structural description of hydrogen bonding within phenylenebis(oxamides) and related ligands is unreported in the literature. The crystallisation and single crystal X-ray diffraction studies of ligands L 1 to L 10 and L 22 have resulted in the determination of nine novel crystal structures. Hydrogen bonding is present in all eleven molecules and is described using graph-set notation. Using this notation, the dimensionality of the supramolecular architectures is compared directly. The study has shown that the modification of the phenylenebis(oxamide) ligand framework leads to the formation of hydrogen bonded networks of varying dimensionality: zero-dimensional (L 1 and L 4), one-dimensional (L 6, L 7, L 8, L 10 and L 22), two-dimensional (L 2, L 5 and L 9) and three-dimensional (L 3). The different dimensionality of the networks {{can be attributed to the}} different functional groups present on the ligands and the level of substitution of the aromatic ring. The diethyl ester oxamic ester structures (L 1, L 4 and L 6) are of lower dimensionality than their N,N?-phenylenebis(oxamides) equivalents (L 3, L 5 and L 7). L 3 forms an unique infinite three-dimensional 66 network, L 5 has an infinite two-dimensional (4, 4) net structure and L 7 forms an infinite one-dimensional ladder. Assemblies of higher dimensionality are achieved upon the change in substitution position of the oxamic acid esters. Movement from ortho- (L 1) to meta- (L 8) to para- (L 9) results in the increase in dimensionality from zero- to one- to two-dimensions, respectively. The dimensionality of the supramolecular system can be disrupted by the deprotonation of the ligand and the introduction of a bulky cation, as evident from the structure of L 22. The syntheses, structural characterisation and physical properties of transition-metal complexes of L 1, L 4 and L 6 are presented in Chapter 3. The synthesis of the sodium salts of copper(II) complexes of L 1, L 4 and L 6 resulted in the formation of [Na] 2 [Cu(L 1) ]? 7 H 2 O (1), [Na] 2 [Cu(L 4) ]? 7 H 2 O (4) and [Na] 2 [{Cu(L 6) }(H 2 O) 5]? 2 H 2 O (7). The crystal structure of 7 is presented herein and consists of a two-dimensional architecture. The metatheses of 1, 4 and 7 with tetraphenylphosphonium bromide yielded the complexes [PPh 4] 2 [Cu(L 1) ] (2), [PPh 4] 2 [Cu(L 4) ] (5), and [Na] 2 [PPh 4] 2 [Cu(L 6) ] 2 ? 7. 1 H 2 O (8), respectively. The structures of 2 and 5 consist of discrete [Cu(L) ] 2 - units (where L = L 1 or L 4) and tetraphenylphosphonium cations. The elucidation of the structure of 8 showed that the complete metathesis was not achieved. However, the formation of one-dimensional sodium-copper chains, where L 6 is coordinated to the copper atom in a tetradentate manner with tetraphenylphosphonium cations within the lattice, had resulted. These chains are hydrogen bonded together through lattice water molecules which themselves are arranged in hexameric chains throughout the crystal lattice. The syntheses of <b>manganese-copper</b> chains, where the L 1, L 4 and L 6 are coordinated to the copper atom, are presented. The crystallisation of [MnCu(L 1) (H 2 O) 3] (3) was not successful but the structural characterisation of [MnCu(L 4) (H 2 O) 3]? 4 H 2 O (6) and [MnCu(L 6) (H 2 O) 3]? 4 H 2 O (9) was. These exhibit unique hydrogen bonding between the ten water molecules, that reside between the chains, with butterfly topology. This thesis presents the first ever crystallographic evidence for this low energy arrangement of ten water molecules. 6 and 9 display identical ferrimagnetic behaviour and low temperature maxima in the magnetic moment (?eff) at around 10 K. Upon complete dehydration, 6 behaves as a metamagnet with a critical field of approximately 1 kOe...|$|E
