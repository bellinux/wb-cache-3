5|$|The crests and frills of some dinosaurs, {{like the}} marginocephalians, theropods and lambeosaurines, <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> fragile {{to be used}} for active defense, and so they were likely used for sexual or {{aggressive}} displays, though little is known about dinosaur mating and territorialism. Head wounds from bites suggest that theropods, at least, engaged in active aggressive confrontations.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{have either}} a mutualistic or {{commensal}} relationship with humans. Two main theories are given about how cats were domesticated. In one, people deliberately tamed cats {{in a process}} of artificial selection as they were useful predators of vermin. This has been criticized as implausible, because the reward for such an effort <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> little; cats generally do not carry out commands and although they do eat rodents, other species such as ferrets or terriers may be better at controlling these pests. The alternative idea is that cats were simply tolerated by people and gradually diverged from their wild relatives through natural selection, as they adapted to hunting the vermin found around humans in towns and villages.|$|E
5|$|In direct {{opposition}} to the immense productivity that she displayed in the early 1860s, Dickinson wrote fewer poems in 1866. Beset with personal loss as well as loss of domestic help, Dickinson <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> overcome to keep up her previous level of writing. Carlo died during this time after providing sixteen years of companionship; Dickinson never owned another dog. Although the household servant of nine years, Margaret O Brien, had married and left the Homestead that same year, {{it was not until}} 1869 that her family brought in a permanent household servant, Margaret Maher, to replace the old one. Emily once again was responsible for chores, including the baking, at which she excelled.|$|E

5|$|The current {{understanding}} of planetary habitability—the {{ability of a}} world to develop environmental conditions favorable {{to the emergence of}} life—favors planets that have liquid water on their surface. Most often this requires the orbit of a planet to lie within the habitable zone, which for the Sun extends from just beyond Venus to about the semi-major axis of Mars. During perihelion, Mars dips inside this region, but Mars's thin (low-pressure) atmosphere prevents liquid water from existing over large regions for extended periods. The past flow of liquid water demonstrates the planet's potential for habitability. Recent evidence has suggested that any water on the Martian surface <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> salty and acidic to support regular terrestrial life.|$|E
5|$|The opening {{lines of}} the poem contain a {{dedication}} to Miles de Nanteuil, an early 13th-century churchman who was elected (but not confirmed) in 1201 as archbishop of Reims, and later became bishop of Beauvais, in northern France; he died circa 1235. According to Todd, the nobleman de Nanteuil <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> young and wild to be elevated to the , but this would have made him {{a good candidate for}} Renart's dedication. This, plus evidence based on other names found in the poem, led Todd to conclude that the poem was composed around the year 1200. Later critics and researchers, however, date the poem between 1204 and 1228, and tend toward the earlier date.|$|E
5|$|Alex Tew, {{a student}} from Cricklade in Wiltshire, England, {{conceived}} The Million Dollar Homepage in August 2005 when he was 21 years old. He {{was about to begin}} a three-year Business Management course at the University of Nottingham, and was concerned that he would be left with a student loan that could take years to repay. As a money-raising idea, Tew decided to sell a million pixels on a website for $1 each; purchasers would add their own image, logo or advertisement, and have the option of including a hyperlink to their website. Pixels were sold for US dollars rather than UK pounds; the US has a larger online population than the UK, and Tew believed more people would relate to the concept if the pixels were sold in US currency. In 2005, the pound was strong against the dollar: £1 was worth approximately $1.80, and that cost per pixel <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> expensive for many potential buyers. Tew's setup costs were €50, which paid for the registration of the domain name and a basic web-hosting package. The website went live on 26 August 2005.|$|E

5|$|Marine mammals {{attained}} {{their greatest}} diversity during the Miocene, such as with baleen whales with over 20 recognized genera {{in comparison to}} only six extant genera. Such diversity presented an ideal setting to support a super-predator such as megalodon. However, {{by the end of}} the Miocene, many species of mysticetes had gone extinct; surviving species may have been faster swimmers and thus more elusive prey. Furthermore, after the closure of the Central American Seaway, tropical whales decreased in diversity and abundance. The extinction of megalodon correlates with the decline of many small mysticete lineages, and it is possible that it was quite dependent on them as a food source. Additionally, a marine megafauna extinction during the Pliocene was discovered to have eliminated 36% of all large marine species including 55% of marine mammals, 35% of seabirds, 9% of sharks, and 43% of sea turtles, likely aiding in its extinction; megalodon <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> large to sustain itself on the declining tropical food supply. The cooling of the oceans during the Pliocene might have restricted the access of megalodon to the polar regions, depriving it of its food source of large whales which had migrated there.|$|E
5|$|Urobuchi {{stated that}} Sayaka was his {{favorite}} character overall, and remarked that her plotline was the most enjoyable to write. Due to her grim fate {{by the end of}} the series, a destiny that Shinbo believed was slightly unfair, he asked Urobuchi if it was possible to change the plot so that Sayaka could be spared. Urobuchi declined, asserting that her death was too integral to the overarching story. Shinbo then inquired if there were any way that she could be brought back to life, admitting he had become very attached to the character. However, Urobuchi again refused, explaining that this would be impossible with regard to the already-established rules governing the story. Shinbo finally acquiesced to this, but remarked that he believed there <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> large of a burden placed on the characters who were in essence young middle school girls.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} year of development, Gas Powered Games found that {{they were not going to}} be able to finish the game within the planned two years; not only was the {{seamless}} world without loading screens harder to create than they had thought, but, according to lead developer Bartosz Kijanka, they had been overambitious in choosing how many innovative features they could put into the game's custom engine, such as the wide range through which the virtual camera system could zoom in and out. Other features supported and later dropped included allowing up to ten characters at once—and therefore maintaining up to ten areas of the single-player world—instead of the final maximum of eight, and a weather system that included wind blowing projectiles off course. According to Kijanka, the developers also spent a lot of time changing technologies mid-development, such as building a custom animation editor before moving to a licensed one, and starting with the OpenGL graphics library only to switch to Direct3D. As a result, the team was required to work 12–14 hour days and weekends for most of the development time in order to complete the game within four years. In a 2011 interview, Taylor stated that in retrospect the final cost in development time of the seamless world <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> high, and also that the team tried to make too large of a game for their budget; he believed that a game with closer to 35 hours of playtime instead of 70 would have been a better and more polished experience given their constraints.|$|E

With the troops tired, units mixed {{as the result of}} the fighting, communications broken and the night dark, it was inevitable that orders should be delayed and that in some cases they should never reach the addressees. This is what in fact occurred. Some units and sub-units withdrew without incident. Others, finding themselves unable to use the only road, had to make their way as best they could across country. On the left flank, there were no roads, so some parties reached the coast and, taking boats, rejoined farther south. Some, again, were still in position the following morning. The fact is that the withdrawal, necessary as it <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been,</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> fast and too complicated for disorganised and exhausted troops, whose disorganisation and exhaustion it only increased.

5|$|From March 1958 Formby {{appeared}} in the musical comedy Beside the Seaside, a Holiday Romp in Hull, Blackpool, Birmingham and Brighton. By the time it reached Brighton the play was playing to increasingly small audiences, and the run was cut short as a result. The play {{may not have been}} to southern audiences' tastes—the plot centres on a northern family's holiday in Blackpool—and the Brighton audiences <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>too</b> small, but those in the north, particularly Blackpool, thought highly of it and the show was a nightly sell-out. When the show closed Formby was disappointed, and vowed never to appear in another stage musical. The year 1958 was professionally quiet for him; in addition to Beside the Seaside, he also worked in one-off appearances in three television shows. He began 1959 by appearing in Val Parnell's Spectacular: The Atlantic Showboat in January, and in April hosted his own show, Steppin' Out With Formby. During the summer season he appeared at the Windmill Theatre, Great Yarmouth, although he missed two weeks of performances when he was involved in a car crash on the August Bank Holiday. When doctors examined him, they were concerned with his overall health, {{partly as a result of}} his forty cigarettes-a-day smoking habit. He also had high blood pressure, was overweight and had heart problems.|$|E
