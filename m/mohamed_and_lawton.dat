40|$|Objective - To {{explore the}} {{activities}} of daily living ADL performance profile of community-living people with dementia and to investigate its relationship with dementia severity. Materials & Methods - ADL performance of 86 subjects were evaluated using Barthel Index (BI), <b>Lawton</b> <b>and</b> Brody's Instrumental Activities Daily Living (IADL) and Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS). Dementia severity was measured by Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). Results - Subjects were able to perform most basic ADL (BI mean = 16. 4) <b>and</b> some IADL (<b>Lawton</b> <b>and</b> Brody's IADL mean = 4. 3). The AMPS process ability measure <b>and</b> the <b>Lawton</b> <b>and</b> Brody's IADL were significantly correlated with CDR (P < 0. 01). Conclusions - Subjects with mild dementia were able to perform mostly all basic ADL and some IADL. The AMPS process ability measure <b>and</b> the <b>Lawton</b> <b>and</b> Brody's IADL could provide useful information on their ability to live independently in the community.
