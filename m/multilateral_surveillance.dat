The performance scorecard presented at the 2012 Annual Statutory Meetings of the WAMZ shows that GDP growth was projected to decline to 6.9% in 2012 from 8.7% in 2011. The convergence scale of the whole WAMZ area was also projected to go down from a score of 79.2% in 2011 to 62.5% in 2012; as no member met all the convergence criteria.

And once the agreements were secured, General Motors both solicited and employed the assistance of its alleged co-conspirators in helping to police them.

This debate has had to confront the implications of the huge growth of international capital movements, one of whose consequences has been the increased “privatization” of external financing for developing countries. The paper begins with surveys of major features of the post-war evolution of the system of governance of the international financial system and of the principal trends in capital flows to developing countries during the past three decades. These {{set the stage for a}} selective review of appropriate policy responses to international financial instability, with the main focus on proposals for remedying structural and institutional weaknesses in the global financial architecture through such means as greater transparency and improved disclosure, strengthened financial regulation and supervision, more comprehensive and even-handed <b>multilateral</b> policy <b>surveillance,</b> and bailing in the private sector by arrangements for orderly debt workouts. In view of the continuing absence of effective measures at the global level for dealing with financial instability, the paper puts special emphasis on the maintenance by developing countries of national autonomy regarding policy towards capital movements. ...|$|R

The paper calibrates the (yet undisclosed) algorithm for computing the minimum budgetary targets that EU countries can declare as MTO and discusses two novel features of the algorithm: a supplementary debt-reduction effort requested from high-debt countries, and the partial frontloading of the expected future increases in age-related expenditure -the cost of ageing-. The paper evaluates the impact of the crisis on EU countries? current as well as future MTOs through the channels of higher public debt, lower growth potential, and higher cost of ageing. On the basis of alternative scenarios for macroeconomic and budgetary conditions as of 2012 -when the next revision of MTOs is scheduled-, the paper concludes that prospective MTOs would be more stringent than the current ones. Therefore, a path for gradual fiscal tightening is already embedded into the European fiscal framework and should be considered when discussing exit strategies. Finally, an alternative indicator linking MTOs to the current fiscal and financial imbalances is presented.

We find that the OECD has a clear single objective for its benchmarking and peer review activities (i. e. horizontal policy transfers) whereas the EU suffers from a mix of objectives (a. horizontal policy learning; b.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} a China-US “G 2 ” is neither {{necessary}} nor sufficient for the resolution of crucial global order issues such as excessive global payments imbalances. Although the bilateral payments imbalance between both countries constitutes the largest component of global imbalances, the acuteness of relative power concerns and their reverberation in domestic politics has rendered the G 2 unable {{to address this problem}} effectively. Their bilateral conflict has also hampered the efforts of the G 20 and the IMF on global imbalances, but these two bodies together offer much better prospects for progress in this area. Reducing global imbalances requires them to address their main origins, which lie in the domestic political constraints on national policymakers and the asymmetries of international power that have progressively delegitimized the IMF and the <b>multilateral</b> <b>surveillance</b> process. Domestic political constraints will remain important, but the latter problem is, surprisingly, less intractable. The G 20 and IMF could achieve progress by (1) undertaking more ambitious reforms of IMF governance to improve the legitimacy of IMF finance and of the <b>multilateral</b> <b>surveillance</b> process, and (2) promoting a more symmetrical multicurrency reserve system with associated policy guidelines for actual and potential reserve currency issuers, and reserve accumulation guidelines among the rest of the IMF membershi...|$|E
40|$|Introduction]. With the Open Method of Coordination (OMC), the European Union {{added a new}} mode of {{governance}} to existing policy-making instruments. Instead of introducing joint competencies, the OMC consists of <b>multilateral</b> <b>surveillance</b> of national policies. Supporters of the OMC claim that it was developed to reconcile legitimacy with effectiveness since it {{takes into account the}} diversity of national welfare states while facilitating trans-border policy learning. In contrast, this paper seeks to show that EU member states mainly use soft law in response to substantive disagreements. This mirrors earlier developments of the OECD and the IMF, where <b>multilateral</b> <b>surveillance</b> was also introduced to resolve deadlocks. In each case, member states opted for a non-binding procedural solution to overcome competing visions of the organizations’ purposes. Hence international organizations select soft law less for its effectiveness than for its capacity to foster compromises. Based on case studies, this paper juxtaposes the inauguration of soft coordination in the OECD, the IMF and the EU during the 1960 s, 1970 s and 1990 s respectively. In all cases member states opted for soft law in times of ‘institutional crisis’ when more substantial agreements proved unattainable. As shown elsewhere, soft law policy coordination in the European Union shares many features with <b>multilateral</b> <b>surveillance</b> of the OECD and the IMF (Schäfer 2004). Hence we can obtain a broader view on why soft law was introduced to the EU by also looking at its origins in these organizations. A central argument of this paper is that existing approaches fail to convincingly explain the choice of soft law. They are much better at understanding harder forms of delegation and legal integration. Before we proceed, we have to clarify the notion of “soft law. ” In general, we use it if there are neither binding rules nor sanctions to enforce compliance. In terms of the concept of legalization (Abbott et al. 2000), soft law scores low both on obligation and delegation but sometimes can be quite precise. More specifically, we stick to the following definition of soft law: “Rules of conduct that are laid down in instruments which have not been attributed legally binding force as such, but nevertheless may have certain (indirect) legal effects, and that are aimed at and may produce practical effects”(Senden 2004 : 112, emphasis deleted). The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 looks at possible theoretical explanations for the choice of soft law. Recent contributions in the principal-agent framework are a good starting point to trace the question when governments decide to delegate or pool sovereignty. Since delegation always goes along with agency losses – principals cannot completely control agents – governments shy away from it if there is policy conflict. Based on this insight, section 3 offers a historical reconstruction of the introduction of soft law, in this case procedures of <b>multilateral</b> <b>surveillance,</b> in the OECD, the IMF, and the EU. Section four concludes...|$|E
