5|$|Nintendo {{announced}} {{a sequel to}} EarthBound for the Nintendo 64 in 1996: Mother 3 (EarthBound 64 in North America). It was scheduled for release on the 64DD, a Nintendo 64 expansion peripheral that used a <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>drive,</b> but struggled to find a firm release date as its protracted development entered development hell. It was later canceled altogether in 2000 when the 64DD flopped.|$|E
5|$|The <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>drive</b> {{manufactured}} by Canon Inc. {{was used as}} the primary mass storage device. These drives were relatively new to the market, and the NeXT was the first computer to use them. They were cheaper than hard drives (blank media especially so: though each had a cost of $150 to Canon, Jobs's typically forthright negotiations saw Canon agree to a retail of only $50 apiece) but slower (with an average seek time of 96 ms). The design made it impossible to move files between computers without a network, since each NeXT Computer had only one MO drive and the disk could not be removed without shutting down the system. Storage options proved challenging for the first NeXT Computers. The magneto-optical media was relatively expensive and had performance and reliability problems despite being faster than a floppy drive. The drive was not sufficient to run as the primary medium running the NeXTSTEP operating system both in terms of speed and capacity.|$|E
500|$|NeXT {{released}} a {{second generation of}} workstations in 1990. The new range included a revised NeXT Computer, renamed the NeXTcube, and the NeXTstation, nicknamed [...] "the slab," [...] which used a [...] "pizza box" [...] case form-factor. Jobs was explicit in ensuring NeXT staff {{did not use the}} latter terminology, lest the NeXT machines be compared to competing Sun workstations. The <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>drive</b> was replaced with a 2.88 MB floppy drive to offer users a way to use their floppy disks. However, individual 2.88 MB floppies were expensive and the technology did not supplant the 1.44 MB floppy. Realizing this, NeXT utilized the CD-ROM drive, which eventually became an industry standard for storage. Color graphics were available on the NeXTstation Color and the NeXTdimension graphics processor hardware for the NeXTcube. The new computers were cheaper and faster than their predecessors, with the new Motorola 68040 processor.|$|E

50|$|<b>Magneto-optical</b> <b>drives</b> use sector {{sizes of}} 512 and 1024 bytes on 5.25-inch drives and 512 and 2048 bytes on 3.5-inch drives.|$|R
50|$|LaCie's {{original}} {{business was}} external SCSI hard drives, but its range has expanded {{over the years}} to include early CD writers, some of the first DVD <b>drives,</b> <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>drives,</b> SyQuest drives, tape backup, RAID arrays, and mobile USB and FireWire drives.|$|R

50|$|The NeXTcube was the {{successor}} to the original NeXT Computer. It differs from its predecessor in having a 25 MHz 68040 processor, larger hard disks {{in place of the}} <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>drive,</b> and an optional floppy disk drive. A 33 MHz NeXTcube Turbo was produced later.|$|E
50|$|Fujitsu {{was a major}} {{manufacturer}} of 90 mm <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>drives,</b> exceeding 2 GB in capacity, but they have discontinued production and sale of this product category.|$|R
5000|$|PDO Konica Minolta was {{the last}} {{manufacturer}} of 90 mm 3.5" [...] <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>drives.</b> They had a 3.5" [...] 1.3 GB USB external pocket drive available {{for sale in the}} United States and Europe.|$|R
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 1997 Plasmon {{launched}} its DW260 drive, which used LIMDOW technology for {{a higher level of}} performance than previous <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>drives.</b> LIMDOW drives that shipped {{in the second half of}} 1997 has search speeds of less than 15 ms and data transfer rates in excess of 4 Mbit/s, which are fast enough for storing audio and streaming MPEG-2 video.|$|R

50|$|A <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>drive</b> {{is a kind}} {{of optical}} disc drive capable of writing and {{rewriting}} data upon a magneto-optical disc. Both 130 mm (5.25 in) and 90 mm (3.5 in) form factors exist. The technology was introduced commercially in 1985. Although optical, they appear as hard disk drives to the operating system and can be formatted with any file system. Magneto-optical drives were common in some countries, such as Japan because {{of the success of the}} Sony MiniDisc, but have fallen into disuse.|$|E
50|$|The Digitronix PC (DTX PC) of 1992 is an {{inexpensive}} OEM personal computer {{that can also}} serve as a business capable workstation or a clustered file server. It boasted 100 megabytes of ram, an HDTV monitor and optical disk storage, possibly based on the NeXTcube's <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>drive.</b> It also had built in compatibility with NTSC\PAL formats and had built in composite video out, as well as advanced digital audio and video editing capacity on-chip, possibly as coprocessors similar to the Amiga.|$|E
50|$|When color {{support was}} added in NeXTStep 2.0, color {{versions}} of all icons were added. The <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>drives</b> {{were no longer}} delivered with these machines but its wait-cursor icon remained, continuing in its role, as the contemporary CD Rom drives were even slower (at 1x, 150 KB/s).|$|R
5000|$|Besides {{the common}} Compact Disc and DVD optical media in write-once or rewritable forms, Storage systems may use other {{specialized}} optical formats like <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>drives</b> for {{storage and distribution}} of data. Optical jukeboxes {{can be used for}} nearline storage. Optical media in jukeboxes can be removed, transitioning it from nearline to offline storage.|$|R
5000|$|Pinnacle Micro {{was a major}} {{manufacturer}} of <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>drives.</b> 3.5" [...] drives were 128 MB and 230 MB. 5.25" [...] drives produced were 650 MB and 1.3 GB (Sierra), 2.6 GB (Vertex) and 4.6 GB (Apex). The Vertex and Apex were non-ISO standard drives and used proprietary media. Pinnacle Micro has ceased production of these products.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1980s, a {{class of}} mass storage device called the <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>drive</b> became commercially {{available}} which used essentially the same technique for writing data to a disk. One advantage of magneto-optic recording over purely magnetic storage {{at that time was}} that the bit size was defined {{by the size of the}} focused laser spot rather than the magnetic field. In 1988, a 5.25-inch magneto-optic disk could hold 650 megabytes of data with a roadmap to several gigabytes; a single 5.25" [...] magnetic disk had a capacity of around 100 megabytes.|$|E
50|$|The {{variety of}} {{expansion}} bay options available was wide, {{but because of}} {{the size and shape of}} the computer, fitting a CD-ROM drive into the available space wasn't possible. Apple had a prototype CD-ROM module compatible with non-standard 80 mm disks that would have been used with the PowerBook 5300 series, but finished versions of this device were never released. Instead, it was planned that the 5300 series would use 3.5 inch <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>drive</b> modules initially, with the option of releasing a stretched version a year or two later that had space for a full-sized CD-ROM drive.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{web page}} may be lost, but Paul Jones of UNC-Chapel Hill in North Carolina {{announced}} in May 2013 that Berners-Lee gave {{him what he}} says is the oldest known web page during a 1991 visit to UNC. Jones stored it on a <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>drive</b> and on his NeXT computer. On 6 August 1991, Berners-Lee published a short summary of the World Wide Web project on the newsgroup alt.hypertext. This date is sometimes confused with the public availability of the first web servers, which had occurred months earlier. As another example of such confusion, several news media reported that the first photo on the Web was published by Berners-Lee in 1992, an image of the CERN house band Les Horribles Cernettes taken by Silvano de Gennaro; Gennaro has disclaimed this story, writing that media were [...] "totally distorting our words for the sake of cheap sensationalism." ...|$|E
50|$|The LIMDOW disk has two {{magnetic}} layers {{just behind}} the reflective writing surface. This write surface can take magnetism {{from one of those}} magnetic layers when it is heated up to one temperature; but if it is heated up further, it will take its polarity from the other magnetic layer. To write the data onto the disk, the <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>driveâ€™s</b> laser pulses between two powers.|$|R
50|$|By default, <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>drives</b> verify {{information}} {{after writing}} {{it to the}} disc, {{and are able to}} immediately report any problems to the operating system. This means writing can actually take three times longer than reading, but it makes the media extremely reliable, unlike the CD-R or DVD-R media upon which data is written without any concurrent data integrity checking. Using a magneto-optical disc is much more like using a diskette drive than a CD-RW drive.|$|R

50|$|The two-part and nine-year {{development}} of Mother 3, a role-playing video game, {{took place between}} 1994 and 2006 with a three year gap in-between, and spanned four consoles and multiple delays. Following the commercial success of its predecessor, Mother 2 (EarthBound outside Japan), Mother series creator Shigesato Itoi was given the previous games development team. Inspired by Super Mario 64, the team set out to create a 3D game that ultimately exceeded {{the capabilities of the}} platform and changed their console focus from the Super Famicom to the Nintendo 64 and its 64DD <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>drive</b> expansion peripheral, for which it was expected to be a 1998 launch title. Upon the commercial failure of the 64DD, it was converted to the cartridge-only format. Itoi thought of the games concept during Mother 2 development and built a 12-chapter story with player-characters that rotated between chapters. Having been a producer during Mother 2, Itoi served as a scriptwriter during Mother 3 development. A North American version was announced as EarthBound 64, but did not materialize when the 60 percent-complete Japanese release was cancelled in August 2000 in reprioritization leading up to Project Dolphin (the code name of the GameCube). At the time, the game was estimated to need another two years of work.|$|E
5000|$|Since the CD-MO was {{otherwise}} physically identical to [...] "normal" [...] CDs, it still adopted their spiral-groove recording scheme, {{which would have}} rendered it hard {{to use as a}} removable medium for repeated, small scale deletions and recordings (not unlike CD-RW). There were (and are) however some <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>drives</b> and media with the same form factor that don't have this limitation. Unlike modern CD-RWs, CD-MO allowed for hybrid discs containing both an unmodifiable, pressed section, readable in standard drives, and a writable MO section.|$|R
5000|$|Maxoptix, a {{spin-off}} of Maxtor Corp., {{is a major}} {{manufacturer of}} 130 mm or 5.25" [...] <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>drives.</b> A current model is the T7-9100 drive, which has a maximum capacity of 9.1 GB and is downward read and write compatible with 5.2 GB, 4.8 GB, 4.1 GB, 2.6 GB, and 2.3 GB magneto-optical disks, and read compatible with 1.3 GB, 1.2 GB, 650 MB, and 600 MB magneto-optical disks. Popular older models of 5.25" [...] Maxoptix MO drives are the T6 Star, T6-5200 and T5-2600 MO drives. Maxoptix was acquired by Techware Distribution in 2008.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Magneto-optical</b> <b>drives</b> are not Floptical drives, which {{likewise}} combine ferromagnetic {{and optical}} technologies, albeit {{in a different}} manner. Flopticals are 21 megabyte 3.5" [...] magnetic diskettes using optical tracks to increase the tracking precision of the magnetic head, from the usual 135 tracks per inch to 1,250 tracks per inch. No laser or heating is involved; a simple infrared LED is used to follow the optical tracks, while a magnetic head touches the recording surface. The drives can also read and write traditional 3.5" [...] diskettes, although not the 2.88 megabyte variety. Flopticals were manufactured by Insite Peripherals, a company founded by Jim Burke.|$|R
5000|$|Mother 3 was {{originally}} {{developed for the}} Super Famicom (Super Nintendo Entertainment System) beginning in 1994. Shigeru Miyamoto, head of Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development and Mother 3 producer, said that Mother 3 was [...] "a commercial decision", since Mother 2 (EarthBound outside Japan) had sold well. By this point, Mother series creator Shigesato Itoi had worked on the series' earlier games and Itoi Shigesato no Bass Tsuri No. 1 and was experienced at pitching video games, so Miyamoto provided a team willingly. The Mother 2 development team carried over to the new game's development, though several people left and the team grew in size. They forewent the usual prototyping phase and went straight into development expecting to create something unprecedented. Itoi {{said he wanted to}} make the game like a Hollywood film. In September 1994, he predicted that Mother 3 development would end around 1996 with a release on Nintendo's then-upcoming console. The team was inspired by Super Mario 64 and felt that they too could creatively flourish by making a 3D world without restrictions. Their early technical specifications exceeded the capabilities and memory limits of the platform. About halfway through development, the team attempted to scale back its large scope and changed its development platform to the 64DD, a Nintendo 64 <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>drive</b> expansion peripheral. At E3 in June 1997, Miyamoto speculated that Mother 3 {{would be one of the}} four titles for the then-expected 1998 launch of the Japan-only peripheral, but the game was instead converted to a Nintendo 64 cartridge-only format upon the commercial failure of the repeatedly delayed 64DD.|$|E
50|$|In computing, {{mass storage}} {{refers to the}} storage of large amounts of data in a {{persisting}} and machine-readable fashion.

It also includes experimental forms like holographic memory. Mass storage includes devices with removable and non-removable media. It does not include random access memory (RAM).|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] In {{the time}} optimal control problem, it is {{important}} to select a switching point accurately in order to improve tracking speed performance. However, the accurate selection of the switching point is not an easy task because of the damping coefficient variations and modeling uncertainties in actual systems. To relieve the difficulty and inconvenience of this task, adaptive model-following control (AMFC) is implemented. AMFC can make the controlled plant follow as closely as possible a desired reference model whose switching point can be calculated easily and accurately, assuring that the error between the reference model and the real system approaches zero. The AMFC is applied for a tracking actuator of a <b>magneto-optical</b> disk <b>drive</b> (MODD) to improve its slow tracking performance. According to the simulation and experimental results, an average tracking time as small as 20 ms is obtained for a 3. 5 in. <b>magneto-optical</b> disk <b>drive.</b> 1...|$|R

50|$|Data {{recording}} (and erasing) {{was achieved}} by heating the magneto-optical layer's material (e.g. DyFeCo or less often TbFeCo or GdFeCo) up to its Curie point thus erasing all previous data and then using a magnetic field to write the new data, in a manner essentially identical to Sony's MiniDisc and other magneto-optical formats. Reading of the discs relied on the Kerr effect. This {{was also the first}} major flaw of this format: it could be read in only special drives and was physically incompatible with non <b>magneto-optical</b> enabled <b>drives,</b> in a much more radical way than the later CD-RWs.|$|R
