Os critérios de inclusão foram: estabilidade hemodinâmica, massa anexial com diâmetro Purpose: to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of color Doppler in the prediction of results of the systemic treatment of unruptured ectopic pregnancy with a single dose of methotrexate. Methodology: twenty patients with a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy {{were included in the}} study. The inclusion criteria were: hemodynamic stability, adnexal mass < 5. 0 cm and decline of the titers of beta-hCG less than 15 % in an interval of 24 h. The exclusion criteria were hepatic or renal disease and blood dyscrasias. Follow-up was by serial determinations of beta-hCG on days 4 and 7 after the beginning of the treatment, and weekly until the titers were negative. The patients were classified into 3 groups according to color Doppler: high risk (trophoblastic flow covering more than 2 / 3 of the mass), medium risk (when trophoblastic flow compromised 1 / 3 to 2 / 3 of tubal mass) and <b>low</b> <b>risk</b> (when trophoblastic flow covered less than 1 / 3 of the mass). Results: the success of the treatment with a single dose was 75 % (15 / 20); when a second dose of MTX was used, the success rate was 85 %. When comparing color Doppler with the results of the medical treatment, we had high risk in 4 patients and in all the treatment failed; <b>medium</b> and <b>low</b> <b>risk</b> in 16 patients, and in 15 the treatment was successful.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate the association between changes in health care expenditures relative to changes in health risk status for employers of all sizes. Repeat health risk assessments (HRAs) were obtained from 50, 005 employees and spouses with 2 years of health plan enrollment, and from 37, 559 employees and spouses with 3 years of enrollment in employer-sponsored medical coverage. Changes in health care expenditures were measured from the year before completion of the first HRA to the years before and after the completion of the second HRA. Propensity score weighting was used to adjust for those who did not repeat the HRA so results could be extrapolated to the larger population. Propensity score weighted multiple regression analyses were used to estimate the relationship between changes in health care expenditures with changes in risk status for 9 risk categories. Significantly higher health care expenditures were associated with those who moved from <b>low</b> <b>risk</b> to <b>medium</b> or high risk, compared to those who remained <b>low</b> <b>risk.</b> Expenditure reductions estimated for those who improved their health status from high <b>risk</b> to <b>medium</b> or <b>low</b> <b>risk</b> were not statistically significant. This study is unique because of its large sample size, its use of data from a wide range of employer sizes, and its efforts to extend generalizability to those who did not complete both HRAs.

OBJECTIVESThe {{purpose of this}} study was to compare patient outcome among high, <b>medium</b> and <b>low</b> <b>risk</b> {{unstable angina}} patients defined by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) guideline to similar risk groups defined by a validated model from our institution (RUSH). METHODSFour hundred sixteen patients consecutively admitted to the hospital with unstable angina between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1997, were prospectively evaluated for risk factors. The presence of major adverse events such as myocardial infarction (MI), death and heart failure was assessed for each patient by chart review. RESULTSThe composite end point of heart failure, MI or death occurred in 3 % and 5 % of the RUSH and AHCPR <b>low</b> <b>risk</b> categories, respectively, and in 8 % and 10 % of AHCPR and RUSH high risk categories, respectively. Recurrent ischemic events were best predicted by the RUSH model (high: 24 % vs medium: 12 % and low: 10 %, p = 0. 029), but not by the AHCPR model (high: 14 % vs medium: 13 % and low: 9 %, p = 0. 876). The RUSH model identified five times more <b>low</b> <b>risk</b> patients than the AHCPR model. CONCLUSIONSBoth models identify patients with low and high event rates of MI, death or heart failure. However, the RUSH model allowed for five times more patients to be candidates for outpatient evaluation (<b>low</b> <b>risk)</b> with a similar observed event rate to the AHCPR model; also, the RUSH model more successfully predicted ischemic complications. We conclude that the RUSH model can be used clinically to identify patients for early noninvasive evaluation, thereby improving cost effectiveness of care...|$|R

40|$|International audienceINTRODUCTION: Epidemiological studies {{indicate}} that significant decreases {{in the incidence of}} Alzheimer's disease (AD) may be obtained by targeting multiple middle-age risk factors. However, as dementia is unlikely to be diagnosed for decades, short-term outcome measures are required. AD biomarker changes precede clinical symptoms by many years, but their sensitivity to mid-life change remains unknown. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: PREVENT is a prospective cohort study examining biomarker status at mid-life in at least 150 individuals genetically at high, <b>medium</b> or <b>low</b> <b>risk</b> of late-onset AD. Participants are children of individuals with or without a diagnosed AD allocated to high, medium and low-risk groups according to parental clinical status and ApoE genotype. The biomarkers examined over 2 years are plasma and CSF Aβ 42 amyloid, Tau and pTau, proinflammatory cytokines, acute-phase proteins, medial temporal-lobe atrophy, white matter lesion volume, cognitive performance related to transentorhinal and hippocampal functioning and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and sympathetic axes regulation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Detected pathologies are communicated to the participant's general practitioner with their permission. Risk status by genotype would not be revealed. The results of the study would be published in peer-reviewed journals and validated biomarkers used to construct a randomised controlled intervention study...|$|R
40|$|Aim: There {{is a risk}} of {{iatrogenic}} {{injury to}} the soft tissues of the calcaneus and this study assesses the risk of injury to these structures in circular frame calcaneal fracture fixation. Materials and Methods: After olive tip wires were inserted, an L-shaped incision on the lateral and medial aspects of 5 formalin fixed cadaveric feet was performed to expose the underlying soft tissues. The calcaneus was divided into zones corresponding to high, <b>medium</b> and <b>low</b> <b>risk</b> using a grading system. Results: Structures at high risk included the posterior tibial artery, posterior tibial vein and posterior tibial nerve on the medial aspect. Soft tissue structures on the lateral side that were shown to be at lower risk of injury were the small saphenous vein and the sural nerve and the tendons of fibularis longus and fibularis brevis. Conclusion: The lateral surface of the calcaneus provides a lower risk area for external fixation. The risk of injury to significant soft tissues using a circular frame fixation approach {{has been shown to}} be greater on the medial aspect. Clinical Relevance: This study highlights the relevant anatomical relations in circular frame fixation for calcaneal fractures to minimize damage to these structures...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{determine}} the clinical usefulness of breath tests with 13 C-labelled substrates to diagnose small intestinal malabsorption. To this end we studied patients with coeliac disease, {{one of the most common}} causes of small intestinal malabsorption in the industrialised world today. The study showed that the radioactive 14 C-D-xylose breath could be replaced by the 13 C-D-xylose breath test without loss of diagnostic accuracy. The 4 -hour 13 C-D-xylose breath test had satisfactory sensitivity and specificity for untreated coeliac disease. The breath test index improved in treated coeliac disease, but was not normalized. A novel 1 -hour 13 C-sorbitol breath test was also developed. We found that this test can be used to stratify patients into high, <b>medium</b> and <b>low</b> <b>risk</b> for coeliac disease. The 13 C-sorbitol breath test performed significantly better than the H 2 -sorbitol breath test. The 13 C-sorbitol breath test improved in treated coeliac disease, but was not normalized. We conclude that 13 C-labelled breath tests are sensitive tools for small intestinal malabsorption. Further studies are needed to determine the value of 13 C-labelled breath tests in follow-up of coeliac disease...|$|R
