Effects of lifting in four postures (standing, stooping under a 1. 5 m ceiling, stooping under a 1. 2 m ceiling, and kneeling) were investigated together with four lifting conditions (combinations of lifting symmetry and lifting height). The frequency of lifting was set at 4 per minute, and the task duration was 15 minutes. Posture significantly affected the MAWL for the <b>rock</b> <b>dust</b> bag (standing MAWL was 7 % greater than restricted postures and kneeling MAWL was 6. 4 % less than stooped); however, posture interacted with lifting conditions for both of the other materials. Physiological costs were found to be significantly greater in the stooped postures compared to kneeling for all materials. Other contrasts (standing versus restricted postures, stooping under 1. 5 m ceiling versus stooping under 1. 2 m ceiling) did not exhibit significantly different levels of energy expenditure. Energy expenditure was significantly affected by vertical lifting height; however, the plane of lifting had little influence on metabolic cost. Recommended acceptable workloads for the three materials are 20. 0 kg for the <b>rock</b> <b>dust</b> bag, 16. 5 kg for the ventilation stopping block, and 14. 7 kg for the crib block.

30|$|The recent two {{explosions in}} the US coal mines (Sago in 2006 and Upper Big Branch in 2010) show the {{importance}} of <b>rock</b> <b>dusting</b> in reducing the intensity of mine explosion. In the Sago mine explosion, the <b>mine</b> was properly <b>rock</b> <b>dusted.</b> The methane explosion was originated from a newly sealed mine area that completely destroyed the mine seals. The back calculated explosion pressures at the mine seals was about 641  kPa (Gates et al. 2007). The immediate impact of the explosion caused one death to a mining crew of 13 located about 123  m from the destroyed mine seals (about 34.5  kPa explosion pressure). The other 11 fatalities in this accident were caused by CO poisoning. Another crew of 13 miners located about 344  m away from the destroyed mine seals (about 14  kPa explosion pressure) escaped from the accident unharmed. The sharp decrease of the explosion pressure within {{a short distance from}} the explosion source implies the effectiveness of <b>rock</b> <b>dusting</b> in reducing the explosion intensity.|$|R
40|$|Float {{coal dust}} is {{produced}} by various mining methods, carried by ventilating air and deposited on the floor, roof and ribs of mine airways. If deposited, float dust is re-entrained during a methane explosion. Without sufficient inert <b>rock</b> <b>dust</b> quantities, this float coal dust can propagate an explosion throughout mining entries. Consequently, controlling float coal dust is of critical interest to <b>mining</b> operations. <b>Rock</b> <b>dusting,</b> which is the adding of inert material to airway surfaces, is the main control technique currently used by the coal mining industry to reduce the float coal dust explosion hazard. To assist the industry in reducing this hazard, the Pittsburgh Mining Research Division of the U. S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health initiated a project to investigate methods and technologies to reduce float coal dust in underground coal mines through prevention, capture and suppression prior to deposition. Field characterization studies were performed to determine quantitatively the sources, types and amounts of dust produced during various coal mining processes. The operations chosen for study were a continuous miner section, a longwall section and a coal-handling facility. For each of these operations, the primary dust sources were confirmed to be the continuous mining machine, longwall shearer and conveyor belt transfer points, respectively. Respirable and total airborne float dust samples were collected and analyzed for each operation, and the ratio of total airborne float coal dust to respirable dust was calculated. During the continuous mining process, the ratio of total airborne float coal dust to respirable dust ranged from 10. 3 to 13. 8. The ratios measured on the longwall face were between 18. 5 and 21. 5. The total airborne float coal dust to respirable dust ratio observed during belt transport ranged between 7. 5 and 21. 8.

40|$|Proper <b>rock</b> <b>dusting</b> {{practices}} {{have proven to}} be an effective means of preventing coal <b>dust</b> explosions. <b>Rock</b> <b>dust</b> (generally pulverized limestone dust) serves as a heat sink material that prevents or suppresses a propagating coal dust explosion through the absorption of thermal energy from the heated gases and absorption of radiant energy, which reduces the preheating of unburned coal particles ahead of the flame front. Therefore to effectively suppress a coal dust explosion, sufficient quantities of dispersible <b>rock</b> <b>dust</b> must be entrained into the mine entry by the expanding explosion pressure wave to inert the coal dust, also entrained in the entry. The in-mine application of <b>rock</b> <b>dust</b> dates back to the early 1900 s. Since that time, significant technological improvements to <b>rock</b> <b>dust</b> application methods have been implemented along with increasingly stringent regulatory requirements and inspections to ensure adequate quantities of <b>rock</b> <b>dust</b> are applied to the roof, ribs, and floor throughout the mine. Even with enhancements to the <b>rock</b> <b>dusting</b> application methods and equipment, coal mining operations still experience compliance issues associated with meeting the current total incombustible content (TIC) requirement of at least 80 % for all mine dust samples. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducted general surveys of <b>rock</b> <b>dusting</b> practices at nine underground coal mining operations and met with Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) mine inspectors and District personnel {{to gain a better understanding}} of the <b>rock</b> <b>dusting</b> practices and associated compliance issues during this survey period.

40|$|In {{underground}} coal mining, dust {{is produced}} at the face, at conveyors, at transfer points, {{and by the}} normal movement of workers and machines. The coarse coal dust particles settle rapidly. However, the fine coal particles remain airborne much longer, and the ventilating air can move this fine dust relatively long distances into the returns before settling. This fine dust is called float coal dust. It generally consists of particles of coal that pass a 200 -mesh sieve (particles smaller than 75 micrometers). Generalized <b>rock</b> <b>dusting</b> is currently the primary means of defense against coal dust explosions in U.

30|$|Chinese {{coal mines}} also spread the <b>rock</b> <b>dust</b> in the {{underground}} to cover the exposed coal. It is required that the incombustible content of combined coal and <b>rock</b> <b>dusts</b> {{must be at least}} 60 % or 90 % when the CH 4 concentration is over 0.5 %. The quality of <b>rock</b> <b>dust</b> must meet the following quality requirements: (1) the combustible content <  5 %, (2) the content of free silica (SiO 2) <  10 %, (3) free of any toxic or harmful mixture, such as phosphorus and arsenic. The <b>rock</b> <b>dust,</b> mainly limestone dust, should entirely pass through 50 mesh sieve (< 300  μm in sizes), and 70 % of it pass through 200 mesh sieve (< 75  μm in sizes) (Safety SAOW 2006).

30|$|In a methane {{explosion}} event, {{the explosion}} propagation can quickly reach supersonic and thus generates shock wave.

Based on the law of energy conservation, a simplified model can be derived for assessing the <b>rock</b> <b>dust’s</b> heat sink effect. For example, a coal dust load is assumed to be 1.2  kg per meter length of a 2  m ×  6  m mine entry to create dust-air mixture at the minimum explosive concentration of 100  g/m 3 if fully suspended in the air. To demonstrate the heat sink effect of <b>rock</b> <b>dusting,</b> the entry is dusted with limestone powder at 0.00, 2.23 and 4.80  kg per meter of entry to create 0 %, 65 % and 80 % <b>rock</b> <b>dust</b> concentrations, respectively. In an explosion event, the passing hot air at 2000  °C suspends and fully mixes with the coal and <b>rock</b> <b>dusts</b> at a point.

A red read-out indicates that more incombustible material is required to inert the coal and <b>rock</b> <b>dust</b> sample, while a green read-out indicates that the dust sample is sufficiently inert. When the mixture is marginally explosible, a yellow read-out is indicated. The red-yellow-green output depends upon the particle size distribution of the <b>rock</b> and coal <b>dust</b> mixture with the finer size fraction being more explosible...|$|R
40|$|Common {{river sand}} is {{expensive}} due to excessive cost of transportation from natural sources. Also large-scale depletion of these sources creates environmental problems. As environmental transportation and other constraints make {{the availability and}} use of river sand less attractive, a substitute or replacement product for concrete industry needs to be found. River sand is most commonly used fine aggregate {{in the production of}} concrete poses the problem of acute shortage in many areas. Whose continued use has started posing serious problems with respect to its availability, cost and environmental impact. In such a situation the Quarry <b>rock</b> <b>dust</b> can be an economic alternative to the river sand. Quarry <b>Rock</b> <b>Dust</b> can be defined as residue, tailing or other non-voluble waste material after the extraction and processing of rocks to form fine particles less than 4. 75 mm. Usually, Quarry <b>Rock</b> <b>Dust</b> is used in large scale in the highways as a surface finishing material and also used for manufacturing of hollow blocks and lightweight concrete prefabricated Elements. Use of Quarry <b>rock</b> <b>dust</b> as a fine aggregate in concrete draws serious attention of researchers and investigators. This paper presents the feasibility of the usage of Quarry <b>Rock</b> <b>Dust</b> as hundred percent substitutes for Natural Sand in concrete. Mix design has been developed for three grades using design an approach IS, ACI, USBR, RN. No. 4 and BRITISH for both conventional concrete and quarry dust concrete. Tests were conducted on cubes and beams to study th...|$|R
