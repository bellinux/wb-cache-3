50|$|A 25-year-old male {{worker at}} a {{concrete}} pipe manufacturing facility died from injurieshe received while cleaning a ribbon-type concrete mixer. The victim’s daily tasks included cleaning out the concrete mixer {{at the end}} of the shift. The clean-out procedure was to shut off the power at the breaker panel (approximately 35 feet from the mixer), push the toggle switch by the mixer to make sure that the power was off, and then enter the mixer to clean it. No one witnessed the event, but investigators concluded that the mixer operator had shut off the <b>main</b> <b>breaker</b> and then made a telephone call instead of following the normal procedure for checking the mixer before any one entered it. The victim did not know that the operator had de-energized the mixer at the breaker. Thinking he was turning the mixer off, he activated the breaker switch and energized the mixer. The victim then entered the mixer and began cleaning without first pushing the toggle switch to make sure that the equipment was de-energized. The mixer operator returned from making his telephone call and pushed the toggle switch to check that the mixer was de-energized. The mixer started, and the operator heard the victim scream. He went immediately to the <b>main</b> <b>breaker</b> panel and shut off the mixer.|$|E
50|$|A {{generator}} interlock kit {{is installed}} on the front cover of the home's breaker panel. It consists of two sliding steel or plastic (depending on the brand) plates held together by three bolts. When moved down, the plate blocks the generator backfeed circuit breaker and allows the <b>main</b> <b>breaker</b> to remain on; when moved up, the generator backfeed circuit breaker may be turned on, but the main circuit breaker is blocked and will remain off. The generator backfeed circuit breaker is connected to a generator inlet installed (preferably) {{on the outside of}} the structure. A short cord connects the generator to the house inlet, usually through the use of twistlock plugs and sockets.|$|E

50|$|Since {{the early}} 1990s, {{electronic}} flicker-free (or Square-Wave) ballasts {{have become increasingly}} popular and affordable {{as an alternative to}} magnetic ballasts by eliminating most of the problems associated with HMI flicker. Unfortunately, their operation is not as simple as a magnetic ballast. Electronic ballasts {{can be thought of as}} operating in three stages—a DC intermediate converter, a power module, and an AC inverter. Power initially flows through the <b>main</b> <b>breakers</b> into an RF mains filter that prevents the flow of noise back onto the incoming power line. Then, rectifiers and capacitors charge and discharge to invert the negative half of the AC cycle and convert the line to positive DC voltage. This is called the DC intermediate. In the second stage, a buck converter draws from the DC intermediate and regulates current to the final power electronics via an electronic control board. This control board carefully adjusts the high frequency duty cycle of its transistors to maintain optimum color and light output as the lamp ages. Finally, the regulated current is inverted by an LF-converter board that uses four Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs) to switch the DC at precisely 60 Hz into a square wave AC (unlike the sinusoidal pattern of line AC). Leaders in this field include Power Gems Corp, B&S, & Mytronic.|$|R

[...] This description lent itself to {{the title of the}} third novel. It is loosely inferred by the character Jean Paul (Beanpole) to be nuclear fusion. A concentric series of chambers located {{near the center of the}} city and below ground level housed this apparatus; the various doors did not align, so that it was necessary to travel around the perimeter of each chamber to the next entrance. Within the innermost chamber was a single lever that functioned as a <b>main</b> <b>breaker.</b> Moving it from the operating position to the off position deactivated the mechanism, while moving it in the other direction reactivated it. Contact with this lever while the mechanism operated proved instantly fatal to humans.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first issue}} has been widely {{dismissed}} {{by many in the}} power industry. Line workers are already constantly exposed to unexpectedly live wires in the course of normal events (i.e. is a house blacked out because it has no power, or because they pulled the <b>main</b> <b>breaker</b> inside?). Normal operating procedures under hot-line rules or dead-line rules require line workers to test for power as a matter of course, and it has been calculated that active islands would add a negligible risk. However, other emergency workers may not have time to do a line check, and these issues have been extensively explored using risk-analysis tools. A UK-based study concluded that [...] "The risk of electric shock associated with islanding of PV systems under worst-case PV penetration scenarios to both network operators and customers is typically <10−9 per year." ...|$|E

30|$|A foundry {{industry}}. Walk-through energy audit {{carried out}} in this industry by Unachukwu [5] shows that there are opportunities for energy saving in the industry.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Electrical and Computer EngineeringAnil PahwaWarren N. WhiteThis thesis {{focuses on}} {{estimating}} the power loss from power panelboards {{by means of}} power loss models. The model {{is intended to be}} used by HVAC engineers to help estimate building heat loss. While McDonald & Hickok (1985) did not report power losses for power panelboards, Rubin (1979) did. These publications present the power losses of electrical devices at rated loads in tables. In this thesis, the models for electrical devices are created and used, instead of tables, to estimate power losses. The use of curve fit models presents a convenience in calculation of power losses. Breaker, fusible switch, and motor starter power losses presented by McDonald & Hickok (1985) and Rubin (1979) were updated using manufacturer published data, technical papers, industrial standards, and test samples. Test, manufacturer, and analytical model data are collected and power loss curve fit models are created for breakers, fusible switches, motor starters, and bus bars with enclosures. The panelboard power loss is calculated as the sum of partial power losses of the component electrical equipment, i. e. breakers, fusible switches, motor starters, and bus bars with enclosures used in power panelboards. A power loss model for <b>main</b> <b>breaker</b> and fusible switch power panelboards are created based on the sum of breaker, fusible switch, motor starter, and bus bars with enclosure power loss models. The <b>main</b> <b>breaker</b> and fusible switch power panelboard power loss models are used in a heat loss example. It is shown that power panelboard power losses can be significantly overestimated when calculated with one of the methods currently used (Rubin, 1979). This can result in erroneous sizing of HVAC equipment...|$|E
40|$|It is {{cost-effective}} {{to construct}} a High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) grid via interconnecting existing HVDCs. The grid protection and the interconnection between HVDCs are studied in the thesis. The future HVDC grid will be protected via the hybrid HVDC circuit breakers due to their high interrupting speed and low conduction losses. The hybrid DC circuit breakers have to be installed at each line end to fulfil the requirement of the grid protection. The overall cost of the breakers used in a HVDC grid will be extremely high as each breaker contains {{a large number of}} semiconductor switches. The research question in this part is how to reduce the cost of the hybrid DC circuit breakers. The novel interlink hybrid HVDC circuit breakers based on the concept of sharing <b>main</b> <b>breaker</b> branch will be proposed {{to reduce the size of}} the <b>main</b> <b>breaker</b> branch. An alternative method through coordination of converters and hybrid HVDC circuits breakers will be proposed to reduce the current rating of the breaker. Most of the commissioned HVDC projects are point-to-point Line Commutated Converter (LCC) HVDCs. The interconnection of LCC-HVDCs will achieve the benefits of the grid operation, such as highly efficient and flexible power transportation, and high security of power transportation. However, benefits of the interconnection are hindered by the disadvantages of the LCC-HVDC. The first one is that a LCC-HVDC has to reverse its voltage polarity in order to reverse its power. The second one is that a LCC-HVDC is at risk of the commutation failure, which will cause a DC fault when a commutation failure occurs. The research question in this part is how to achieve the interconnection of LCC-HVDCs with the benefits of the grid operation. Interconnection of LCC-HVDCs with the capability of power reversal and commutation failure mitigation will be studied, and the corresponding controls for the interconnection system will be proposes...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we develop {{a method that}} {{provides}} risk-based security assessment in an operating environment considering any type of security violation. Particular {{emphasis is placed on}} security constraints associated with dynamic system performance. Our work is motivated by a perception that today 2 ̆ 7 s deterministic approach to security assessment often results in costly operating restrictions that are not justified by the corresponding low level of risk. A risk-based approach to security assessment is attractive because it balances the system 2 ̆ 7 s reliability cost and reliability worth;Our method allows determination of operating limits based on the risk of insecurity at a given operating point. We characterize the operating point in terms of pre-contingency controllable parameters, the critical parameter set, that most influence the postcontingency system performance. Total risk at a given operating point is obtained summing over all the individual risk associated with defined security violations and their corresponding triggering events. We develop risk expressions that account for fully reliable conventional protection equipment and for <b>main</b> <b>breakers</b> passive and active failures;This dissertation introduces the concept of limiting operating point functions, curves that give limiting values of the critical parameter for various fault locations on a line and characterize the dependency of operating limit on fault type and fault location. The limiting operating point functions combine system stability performance and probability of instability information. This dissertation includes a detailed study on how excitation systems and other parameters affect limiting operating point functions. We also develop, using probability theory, expressions to calculate the conditional probability of insecurity given a fault occurs for thermal overloads and two approaches for computing probability of transient instability; one based on Law of Total Probability and the other on Cartesian products;Finally, we use {{a modified version of the}} IEEE Reliability Test System to illustrate risk-based electric power system security assessment and to compare it with traditional deterministic security assessment. We determine operating limits using iso-risk contours drawn in the space of pre-contingency controllable parameters, effectively creating nomograms based on risk. The contours of constant risk in the space of operating parameters provide a risk management tool that allows managers to justify decisions to operate beyond deterministic operating limits when it is economically advantageous to do so...|$|R
40|$|The work {{is focused}} on {{modeling}} and simulation of a supply vessel from a static and dynamic perspective in an integrated way.

30|$|The {{recorder}} picture {{shows that}} the fault current existed for 78  ms, and the time delay between the main pole and auxiliary contact was more than 36  ms. During this period, when the <b>breaker’s</b> <b>main</b> pole was “ON”, and the fault current detected by the relay was 0.77  A, which was greater than the setting value (0.1  A). Thus, the condition in logic scheme (see Fig.  2) that the current of any phase is greater than setting was considered true. Another condition indicates that the breaker position is “OFF” was also considered to be correct because the breaker position was detected by protection device as “OFF” during the time delay between the main pole and the auxiliary contact. In addition, the “close command” signal had no influence on the logic because of absence, and thus dead-zone protection acted after 36  ms. This {{was consistent with the}} site situation.|$|R
