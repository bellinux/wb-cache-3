2500|$|Following ALFs conclusion, Clausen was {{unemployed}} {{for seven}} months. Clausen's friend suggested {{him to a}} producer from the Fox animated series The Simpsons who {{were looking for a}} new composer. Clausen [...] "had no interest in doing animation" [...] and [...] "wanted to be a drama composer." [...] However, the show's creator Matt Groening told him [...] "we don't look upon this as being a cartoon but a drama where the characters are drawn, and we would like it scored that way." [...] Clausen took the job. Groening told Clausen that the [...] "emotion [...] scored first and the action scored second", unlike many other cartoons, and that [...] "scoring the emotions of the characters" [...] was the primary aim for The Simpsons. Clausen's first episode was [...] "Treehouse of Horror", the third episode of season two, in 1990. It served as an audition and he was hired permanently after that. He has since scored almost all of the music and songs which have appeared on the show, across a wide range of musical styles {{through the end of the}} 28th season. He conducted a 35 piece orchestra for the music, a rarity for television shows, and recorded the score for an episode every week. Clausen wrote an episode's score during the week, recorded it on a Friday, with some variation if vocals are required. The limited timeframe proved the most challenging aspect of the job for Clausen; he was once required to write 57musical cues in one week. For the show's original songs production is much longer; Clausen records the music to the writers' lyrics, over seven or eight months the scene is animated, and then Clausen can re-record the song with a full orchestra. The full orchestra allows easy transition between the wide range of musical styles required for the show. Clausen noted: [...] "The greatest composing challenge has been to try to <b>make</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of musical sense out of the cues when I have only a few seconds to make a musical statement. We have a joke on the scoring stage that I can make you feel five ways in thirteen seconds. We say it in jest, but the reality of the situation is that I am required to do just that quite often." [...] Clausen intentionally opted against composing themes for each character, with some exceptions such as Mr. Burns, and instead [...] " [...] each story its own theme and thematic development...That approach helps to give each story its own special identification, more like individual mini-movies." [...] He supplements the orchestra with additional instruments, such as extra brass for the episode [...] "Cape Feare", for which Clausen composed Sideshow Bob's theme, which continued to be played whenever Bob gets out of prison in subsequent episodes. It is based on the score of the movie Cape Fear, composed by Bernard Herrmann. The musical requests of the writers range from rerecord a specific piece of music to compose something based on this character's emotion in a scene.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Directional biases {{are evident}} in many {{benchmarking}} problems for real-valued global optimisation, {{as well as many}} of the evolutionary and allied algorithms that have been proposed for solving them. It has been shown that directional biases <b>make</b> <b>some</b> <b>kinds</b> of problems easier to solve for similarly biased algorithms, which can give a misleading view of algorithm performance. In this paper we study the effects of directional bias for highdimensional optimisation problems. We show that the impact of directional bias is magnified as dimension increases, and can in some cases lead to differences in performance of many orders of magnitude. We present {{a new version of the}} classical evolutionary programming algorithm, which we call unbiased evolutionary programming (UEP), and show that it has markedly improved performance for high-dimensional optimisation.

40|$|C++ {{cannot be}} used to {{implement}} control/data abstractions as a library if their implementations require specialized code for each user code. This problem limits programmers to write libraries in two ways: it <b>makes</b> <b>some</b> <b>kinds</b> of useful abstractions that inherently require such facilities impossible to implement, and it makes other abstractions difficult to implement efficiently. The OpenC++ MOP addresses this problem by providing libraries the ability to pre-process a program in a context-sensitive and non-local way.

The basic protocol structure of the OpenC++ MOP is based on that of the CLOS MOP, but the OpenC++ MOP runs metaobjects only at compile time.

Yet the history of this changing social experience has proved difficult to accommodate within the traditional practice of film history, that has been focused on the history of films. Instead, cinema has been bracketed with history for the purposes of demonstrating that popular films make bad history; or conversely that history films are `celluloid evidenceÃÂ¿ of the vanished past, that will entertain and engage history students.

Thus similar optimization techniques {{can be used}} across languages. However, certain language features <b>make</b> <b>some</b> <b>kinds</b> of optimizations difficult.

Conversely, <b>some</b> language features <b>make</b> certain optimizations easier. For example, in some languages functions are not permitted to have side effects. Therefore, if a program makes several calls to the same function with the same arguments, the compiler can immediately infer that the function's result need be computed only once. In languages where functions are allowed to have side effects, another strategy is possible. The optimizer can determine which function has no side effects, and restrict such optimizations to side effect free functions. This optimization is only possible when the optimizer has access to the called function.|$|R
