5|$|In some legends, Marko's wonder {{horse was}} a gift from a vila. A Serbian story says that {{he was looking for a}} horse who could bear him. To test a steed, he would grab him by the tail and sling him over his shoulder. Seeing a diseased piebald foal owned by some carters, Marko grabbed him by the tail but could not <b>move</b> <b>him.</b> He bought (and cured) the foal, naming him Šarac. He became an {{enormously}} powerful horse and Marko's inseparable companion. Macedonian legend has it that Marko, following a vilas advice, captured a sick horse on a mountain and cured him. Crusted patches on the horse's skin grew white hairs, and he became a piebald.|$|E
5|$|Pound's lawyer, Julien Cornell, whose {{efforts to}} have him {{declared}} insane are credited with having saved him from life imprisonment, requested his release at a bail hearing in January 1947. The hospital's superintendent, Winfred Overholser, agreed instead to <b>move</b> <b>him</b> to the more pleasant surroundings of Chestnut Ward, close to Overholser's private quarters, which is where {{he spent the next}} 12 years. The historian Stanley Kutler was given access in the 1980s to military intelligence and other government documents about Pound, including his hospital records, and wrote that the psychiatrists believed Pound had a narcissistic personality, but they considered him sane. Kutler believes that Overholser protected Pound from the criminal justice system because he was fascinated by him.|$|E

5|$|Dickinson started {{school at}} Manton Primary in Worksop while his parents moved away to Sheffield. Soon afterwards, {{when he was}} six, he was also {{despatched}} to Sheffield, where he attended a primary school in Manor Top. After six months, his parents decided to <b>move</b> <b>him</b> to a small private school called Sharrow Vale Junior. Due to constant moving, Dickinson states that this period of his life taught him to be self-reliant as {{he was unable to}} make close friends. Dickinson has a younger sister, professional showjumper , who was born in 1963. He tried to isolate himself from her {{as much as he could}} when he was young, supposedly out of spite because she, unlike him, was a planned pregnancy and birth.|$|E
5|$|Due to a {{combination}} of the Browns drafting Clifford Charlton and Junkin's desire to move back inside, the Browns planned to <b>move</b> <b>him</b> back to inside linebacker for the 1988 season. He spent training camp competing with Eddie Johnson for the second inside linebacker position alongside Mike Johnson, {{and by the end of}} preseason play, Junkin had won the starting job. In his first career start against the Kansas City Chiefs, Junkin had six tackles, including the first one of the game in a 6–3 Browns win. A month later, Junkin injured his knee, and was forced to miss several games. He returned to the team in early November, but Johnson had played so well in Junkin's absence that he spent the next few weeks as the backup inside linebacker. He was given the starting job again to end the season, but missed tackles and a lack of impact plays led to his second season being considered a disappointment.|$|E
5|$|Early in Tyler's {{final year}} at Washington, {{injuries}} to the Huskies' halfbacks prompted head coach Don James to <b>move</b> <b>him</b> there from fullback. Washington finished 8–2 {{in the regular}} season, earning them {{a trip to the}} 1981 Rose Bowl against the Michigan Wolverines. With the score tied at zero in the first quarter, Tyler fumbled at the one-yard line; Michigan {{went on to win the}} game 23–6. The running back was drafted 222nd overall (first in the ninth round) by the New Orleans Saints in the 1981 NFL Draft. He played two seasons with the Saints, appearing in all 23 games over those two seasons. Before the 1983 NFL season, the Saints cut him in order to meet the limit on how many players a team may have. He then went on to a short stint with the Oakland Invaders, and then tried to make the Minnesota Vikings. He now lives in Kent, Washington, where he works as a juvenile detention officer.|$|E

5|$|Lee Smith {{was born}} in Jamestown, Louisiana, {{and raised in the}} small town of Castor in Bienville Parish. Buck O'Neil claimed credit for having scouted him. At age 17, partly on O'Neil's recommendation, Smith was drafted in the second round as the 28th overall pick by the Chicago Cubs in the 1975 draft. Smith began his {{professional}} career as a starting pitcher. In 1978 with the Class AA minor league Midland Cubs, Smith struggled as a starter with an ERA near 6.00, prompting manager Randy Hundley to <b>move</b> <b>him</b> to the bullpen. Smith resisted the move and briefly tried college basketball at Northwestern State University. At the behest of former Cubs outfielder Billy Williams, Smith returned to Midland as a reliever for the 1979 season and pitched well enough to earn a promotion to Class AAA baseball for 1980. With the major league Chicago Cubs struggling to a last-place finish, Smith came into the big leagues as a September call-up that season.|$|E
5|$|The 1stbattalion of the Green Howards {{transferred}} {{early in}} 1942 to Ranchi in India, where the climate badly affected Verity's health. After suffering from dysentery, he was weak and his doctors wished {{to send him}} home. However, he resumed his position and, {{by the end of}} the year, his battalion was sent to Persia. In March 1943, the battalion was posted to Kibrit Air Base in Egypt for training and then to Qatana in Syria. Here, preparations were finalised for the Allied invasion of Sicily. Verity remained below peak fitness and was struggling a little owing to his age. His commanding officers planned to withdraw him from front-line fighting and <b>move</b> <b>him</b> to a staff position at headquarters once the Sicily campaign had concluded.|$|E
5|$|The {{dampening}} {{of public}} enthusiasm for freak shows and human oddities continued {{and the police}} and magistrates became increasingly vigilant in closing shows down. Merrick remained a horrifying spectacle for his viewers and Roper grew nervous about the negative attention the Elephant Man drew from local authorities. Merrick's group of managers decided that he should go on tour in Continental Europe, {{with the hope that}} authorities there would be more lenient. Merrick's management was assumed by an unknown man (possibly named Ferrari) and they left for the Continent. The Elephant Man was no more successful there than in Britain, and similar action was taken by authorities to <b>move</b> <b>him</b> out of their jurisdictions. In Brussels, Merrick was deserted by this new manager, who stole Merrick's £50 (2015 equivalent £) savings. Abandoned, Merrick made his way by train to Ostend, where he attempted to board a ferry for Dover but was refused passage. He travelled to Antwerp and was able to board a ship bound for Harwich in Essex. From there, he travelled by train to London and arrived at Liverpool Street station.|$|E

5|$|The sinking smack was {{abandoned}} by the nine unwounded crew, who attempted to remove their captain, who ordered {{that he should be}} thrown overboard rather than slow them down. The crew refused to do so, but found they were unable to <b>move</b> <b>him</b> and left him where he lay. He died in his son's arms a few minutes later. It is said that he was smiling as he died and remained so as the ship sank underneath him. The Ethel & Millie had just arrived on the scene as the Nelson sank, and her captain Skipper Charles Manning called for Nelson's lifeboat to come alongside. Realising that this would greatly overcrowd the second boat, the survivors refused and Manning sailed onwards towards the submarine, coming under lethal fire as he did so. His vessel was soon badly damaged and began to sink.|$|E
5|$|He {{signed a}} two-year {{contract}} with Djurgården in May 2008. The club's initial plan for Josefson was to <b>move</b> <b>him</b> {{up to the}} senior team when regular players {{were out of the}} lineup with illness or injuries, while his usual team would be the J20-team. He scored his first goal in Elitserien on 23 September in his third game, a 4–1 win against Brynäs IF. Ultimately, Josefson played almost every game of the regular season, and usually played along with Carl Gustafsson and Henrik Eriksson on the 4th line. At the end of the season, Josefson had scored 5 goals and 16 points, a record for players 18 or younger playing with the senior team. Josefson was ranked third in the midterm rankings among European skaters by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau for the 2009 NHL Entry Draft. He was selected {{in the first round of}} the 2009 NHL draft by the New Jersey Devils, 20th overall. Josefson was also drafted in the third round, 61st overall, in the 2009 KHL Junior Draft by SKA Saint Petersburg. He participated at the Devils rookie camp in July 2009. He has been compared with centres Nicklas Bäckström and John Madden.|$|E
5|$|Izzie {{appears in}} the first episode of Grey's Anatomy, meeting fellow interns Meredith Grey, Cristina Yang, Alex Karev, and George O'Malley. She and George move in with Meredith and become best friends. Izzie's boyfriend, hockey player Hank (Jonathan Scarfe), struggles to accept her new role as a surgeon, and the two break up. Izzie is hurt when Alex exposes her past as a {{lingerie}} model. However, the two later go on to begin a friendship and then a romance. Alex experiences sexual dysfunction with Izzie and cheats on her with nurse Olivia Harper (Sarah Utterback). When Izzie finds out, she breaks up with him, though they briefly reunite following a bomb incident at the hospital. Izzie reveals while treating a pregnant teenager {{that she had a}} daughter at the age of 16 and gave up for adoption. Izzie falls in love with cardiothoracic patient Denny Duquette (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), and the two become engaged. When Denny's condition deteriorates, Izzie deliberately worsens his health further by cutting his LVAD wire to <b>move</b> <b>him</b> up the donor register. Although Denny receives a new heart, he has a stroke hours later and dies. Izzie is the sole beneficiary of Denny's will, inheriting $8.7million. She uses the money to open a free clinic at the hospital: the Denny Duquette Memorial Clinic.|$|E

5|$|Lindwall {{was rewarded}} with a recall for the Fourth Test at the Adelaide Oval {{at the age of}} 37. After scoring 19 in Australia's first innings of 476, Lindwall was {{restored}} to his role of opening the bowling, this time with Davidson. He took match figures of 3/136 as Australia took a 3–0 lead. This left Lindwall one wicket short of Grimmett, with Meckiff recovered and ready to resume his place in the Fifth Test in Melbourne. The selectors retained Lindwall for the final match, instead dropping batsman Les Favell to accommodate Meckiff. Australia bowled first and Lindwall equalled Grimmett's record by having Bailey caught in the slips by Davidson. He took two difficult low slips catches but could not take the wicket that would <b>move</b> <b>him</b> ahead of Grimmett, finishing with 1/36. Lindwall opened the bowling in the second innings with 28,000 fans awaiting a new record. He beat Bailey with two outswingers in his first over before bowling him for a duck to move ahead of Grimmett. Lindwall took two further wickets to end with 3/37 as Australia completed a 4–0 series victory. Lindwall finished his resurgent season with 40 wickets at 20.55.|$|E
5|$|Republicans were {{generally}} successful {{in state and}} local elections around the country in 1899, and McKinley was optimistic about his chances at re-election in 1900. McKinley's popularity in his first term assured him of renomination for a second. The only question about the Republican ticket concerned the vice presidential nomination; McKinley needed a new running mate as Hobart had died in late 1899. McKinley initially favored Elihu Root, who had succeeded Alger as Secretary of War, but McKinley decided that Root was doing too good a job at the War Department to <b>move</b> <b>him.</b> He considered other prominent candidates, including Allison and Cornelius N. Bliss, but none were as popular as the Republican party's rising star, Theodore Roosevelt. After a stint as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Roosevelt had resigned and raised a cavalry regiment; they fought bravely in Cuba, and Roosevelt returned home covered in glory. Elected governor of New York on a reform platform in 1898, Roosevelt had his eye on the presidency. Many supporters recommended him to McKinley for the second spot on the ticket, and Roosevelt believed it would be an excellent stepping stone to the presidency in 1904. McKinley remained uncommitted in public, but Hanna was firmly opposed to the New York governor. The Ohio senator considered the New Yorker overly impulsive; his stance was undermined by the efforts of political boss and New York Senator Thomas C. Platt, who, disliking Roosevelt's reform agenda, sought to sideline the governor by making him vice president.|$|E
