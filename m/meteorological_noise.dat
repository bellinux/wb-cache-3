Its maximum pressure amplitude near {{the ground is}} 6 Pa, which is far below the <b>meteorological</b> <b>noise.</b> Therefore, it is not simple to detect such small signal. Because it is an internal waves, its amplitude increases with altitude reaching values at 100 km height two orders of magnitude larger than on the ground.|$|E
5000|$|Atmospheric tides are global-scale waves {{excited by}} regular solar {{differential}} heating (thermal tides)or by the gravitational tidal {{force of the}} moon (gravitational tides). The atmosphere behaves like a huge waveguide closed at the bottom (the Earth's surface) and open to space at the top. In such a waveguide {{an infinite number of}} atmospheric wave modes can be excited. Because the waveguide is imperfect, however, only modes of lowest degree with large horizontal and vertical scales can develop sufficiently well {{so that they can be}} filtered out from the <b>meteorological</b> <b>noise.</b> They are solutions of the Laplace equation [...] and are called Hough functions. These can be approximated by a sum of spherical harmonics.|$|E

We assume that this station is also equipped with meteorological sensors, including infra-sound and pressure, in order to perform a complete <b>meteorological</b> <b>noise</b> correction. The science objectives are listed in order of increasing difficulty...|$|E
40|$|Noise mapping {{models are}} able to {{accurately}} predict directly exposed facade levels near busy roads on condition that sufäciently detailed trafäc data is available. At the non-directly exposed side ofthe building, howeve¡ common practice application of standard methods strongly underpredicts sound pressure levels, potentially leading to an incorrect assessment of noise annoyance and sleep disturbance. The concept of background noise mapping was proposed before, which has the important advantage that it can increase the accuracy of existing noise maps at a limited computational cost. In this study, long-term <b>meteorological</b> and <b>noise</b> data showed that turbulence scattering contributes significantly to the noise level at shielded facades, already at sound frequencies below I kHz. Periods with strong atmospheric turbulence are dominant for long-term equivalent noise levels as typically used in strategic noise maps. A comparison between predictions and measurements show that rather high turbulence strengths should be used when producing noise map...|$|R
40|$|Low-frequency passive seismic {{experiments}} utilizing {{arrays of}} 3 -component broad-band seismometers were conducted over two {{sites in the}} emirate of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. The experiments were conducted {{in the vicinity of}} a produc-ing oilfield and around a dry exploration well to better understand the characteristics and origins of microtremor signals (1 – 6 Hz), which had been reported as occurring exclusively above several hydrocarbon reservoirs in the region. The results of the experiments revealed that a strong correlation exists between the recorded ambient <b>noise</b> and observed <b>meteorological</b> and anthropogenic <b>noises.</b> In the frequency range of 0. 15 – 0. 4 Hz, the dominant feature is a double-frequency microseism peak generated by the non-linear interactions of storm induced surface waves in the Arabian Sea. We observed that the double-frequency microseism displays a high variability in spectral amplitude, with the strongest amplitude occurring when Cyclone Gonu was battering the eastern coast of Oman; this noise was present at both sites and so is not a hydrocarbon indicator. Moreover, this study found tha...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{performance}} of rainfall estimation using specific differential phase observed by Bislsan radar, the first polarimetric radar in Korea, three rainfall cases occurring in 2011 were selected, each caused by different conditions: {{the first is the}} Changma front and typhoon, the second is only the Changma front, and the third is only a typhoon. For quantitative use of specific differential phase (KDP), a data quality algorithm was developed for differential phase shift (ΦDP), composed of two steps; the first involves removal of scattered noise and the second is unfolding of ΦDP. This order of the algorithm is necessary so as not to remove unfolded areas, which are the real <b>meteorological</b> target. All <b>noise</b> was removed and the folded ΦDP were unfolded successfully for this study. RKDP relations for S-band radar were calculated for 84, 754 samples of observed drop size distribution (DSD) using different drop shape assumptions. The relation for the Bringi drop shape showed the best statistics: 0. 28 for normalized error, and 6. 7 [*]mm for root mean square error for rainfall heavier than 10 [*]mm[*]h- 1. Because the drop shape assumption affects the accuracy of rainfall estimation differently for different rainfall types, such characteristics should be taken into account to estimate rainfall more accurately using polarimetric variables...|$|R
40|$|Four invar-wire strainmeters {{have been}} {{operated}} in shallow trench sites for 19 months beside the San Andreas Fault at Parkfield, California. Temperature and rainfall records {{were correlated with}} 1 yr of strainmeter data, and 90 per cent of the strain signal power at periods between 2 and 120 days was predicted entirely from these records, using a multi-channel, Wiener filtering technique. The residual strain series fluctuates with a peak-to-peak amplitude of nearly 10 ^(− 6) strain. Anomalous strain signals taking place over several days {{would have to be}} larger than this to be identifiable. Previous work shows that signals of amplitude 10 ^(− 7) strain are identifiable if they take place within hours. Deep creep events giving rise to such signals, which may occur as precursors to earthquakes, would need to be very large. Other workers have shown that shallow, short-base line tiltmeters in California are also very sensitive to <b>meteorological</b> <b>noise.</b> Strainmeter and tiltmeter installations can be made less sensitive to <b>meteorological</b> <b>noise,</b> either by manufacturing instruments with long (∼ 1 km) base lines, or by using tunnel or borehole sites (≳ 100 m deep). Proven instruments of these types are costly, unless an underground site was already available. However, if networks of shallow, shortbase line strainmeters or tiltmeters are to be used for earthquake prediction, it is obviously desirable to invest in at least a few installations which are less sensitive to noise of meteorological origin...|$|E
40|$|Lambeck and Hopgood (1981, 1982) {{have made}} a {{comparative}} study of spectral characteristics of the angular momentum of atmospheric circulation and fluctuations in the Length-of-Day (LOD) data. The Fourier analysis of these data reveals a good correlation between the two processes, including a large spread {{of power in the}} range of a 20 - to 70 -month period. We re-examine here the above two time series by using the Walsh spectral analysis, which seems to be more appropriate for series with sharp peaks and reversals. The comparative study shows that in addition to 12 -, 6 - and 3 -month seasonal terms, the present work discovers statistically significant (90 % confidence interval) periods of (i) 26 months (hitherto weakly resolved) associated with a quasibiennial term, and (ii) 40 ± 4 months in both the data. The resolution of the spread components removes <b>meteorological</b> <b>noise</b> uncertainity from astronomical observations of LOD {{in the study of the}} excitation mechanism of solid earth...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of mesosphere-stratosphere-troposphere (MST) and ST radars {{are located in}} or near mountainous terrain. When measuring horizontal velocities, the terrain is a small factor, but when measuring vertical velocities, the <b>meteorological</b> <b>noise</b> induced by rough terrain can severely limit {{the usefulness of the}} observations. When the variance of the vertical velocity is too large, {{it is not possible to}} suitably filter the data to detect the small synoptic-scale signal with reasonable statistical confidence. The variance of vertical velocity at all tropospheric levels is directly related to the low level wind speed during flow over rough terrain. It is suggested that the synoptic-scale vertical velocity can be measured by ST radars where the terrain is smooth. The large-scale vertical velocity cannot always be reliably determined from MST radar data when the underlying terrain is rough. The vertical velocity is potentially on of future radar site selections, taking into account the desired meteorological applications of the data and engineering design factors. If the synoptic-scale vertical velocity is a desired variable, the radar should not be located near mountains...|$|E
30|$|The {{results from}} this study {{revealed}} that, in many cases, particle sizes do not have a similar response to meteorological conditions and that wind speeds and directions have significantly influence on both noise level and particle concentration (Jamriska and Morawska 2008; Nicolas et al. 2009; Can et al. 2011). These results imply that particle concentrations and distributions are strongly varied with wind speed and direction as they move away from the major source (Zhang et al. 2004; Muzet 2007; Owoade et al. 2013). The influences of <b>meteorological</b> conditions on <b>noise</b> levels appears much more complex. The results show that the correlation between noise level and PM 1 appears relatively moderate during weak turbulent metrological conditions. Previous studies have earlier reported a moderate correlation between noise level and atmospheric particles. The foremost studies include Weber and Litschke (2008) and Davies et al. (2009) which established a slight relationship between some particle concentrations and noise levels. The major finding of the present study is that noise levels and atmospheric particles sensitive to wind speeds and directions as they cover distances from the sources. It is also obvious from this study that sawmill mechanical noise is the major sources of the noise in the study area, noise that results from all kinds of sawmill operation and power capacity engines. Generally, noise levels demonstrate very consistent spatial distributions along locality of sawmill industries and this is independent of meteorology conditions. But, weak turbulent mixing results to moderate association between noise level and some particle concentrations. The spatial correlation between particle concentrations and the noise level was largely weak as a result of higher turbulent mixing and some changes {{in the direction of the}} ambient wind during measurement periods.|$|R
40|$|Fumarole thermal {{monitoring}} is {{a useful}} tool {{in the evaluation of}} volcanic activity, since temperatures strongly relate to the upward flux of magmatic volatiles. Once depurated from <b>meteorological</b> <b>noise,</b> their variations can reflect permeability changes due to crustal stress dynamics eventually associated to seismic activity. In this work, we discuss a fumarole temperature record acquired in the period September 2009 –May 2012 at Vulcano island (Italy), during which changes of volcanic state, local seismic activity and teleseisms occurred. Apart from positive thermal anomalies driven by increments in volcanic activity, we observed 3 episodes at least of concurrence between tectonic earthquakes and fumarole temperature increments, with particular reference to the local August 16 th, 2010 Lipari earthquake, the March 11 th, 2011 Sendai–Honshu (Japan) earthquake and a seismic swarm occurred along the Tindari-Letojanni fault in July–August 2011. We interpreted the seismic-related anomalies as ‘‘crustal fluid transients’’, i. e. signals of volcanogenic vapour flow variations induced by stress-induced permeability changes. From this perspective fumarolic activity can be considered as a tracer of geodynamic instability but, since seismic and volcanic phenomena are in mutual cause-effect relationships, a multidisciplinary observation system is mandatory for correctly addressing thermal data interpretation...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this research project is to contribute to improvement in the synoptic analyses in the tropics for numerical weather prediction and climate research. In addition to a prediction model, four dimensional data assimilation systems have two principal components. One is objective analysis {{and the other is}} initialization. Various methods of objective analysis are designed primarily to analyze the mass and rotational wind fields. Methods of initialization are developed to obtain the irrotational wind and its associated vertical velocity field which are balanced with the mass field and free from <b>meteorological</b> <b>noise.</b> There are essentially three approaches to the problem of initialization: quasi-geostrophic theory, bounded derivative method and nonlinear normal mode method. In the midlatitudes, these approaches generally produce satisfactory results even without diabatic effects for large-scale motions. In the tropics, the situation is quite different from that in the midlatitudes. Because of a small magnitude of the Coriolis parameter and a weak horizontal temperature gradient in the tropics, any method of initialization must incorporate diabatic effects. In fact, {{it can be said that}} understanding the problem of diabatic initialization is the key to improving the analysis and weather forecasting in the tropics...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of the {{long-term}} variability of solar activity is of both astrophysical and geoscientific interest. Reconstructions of solar activity over multiple millennia are traditionally based on cosmogenic isotopes 14 C or 10 Be measured in natural terrestrial archives, but the two isotopes exhibit significant differences on millennial time scales, so that our knowledge of solar activity at this time scale remains somewhat uncertain. Here we present a new potential proxy of solar activity on the centennial-millennial time scale, based on a chemical tracer, viz. nitrate content in an ice core drilled at Talos Dome (Antarctica). We argue that this location is optimal for preserving the solar signal in the nitrate content during the Holocene. By using the firn core from the same location we show that the 11 -year and Gleissberg cycles are present with the variability of 10 – 25 % in nitrate content in the pre-industrial epoch. This {{is consistent with the}} results of independent efforts of modeling HNO 3 and NOy in Antarctic near surface air. However, <b>meteorological</b> <b>noise</b> on the interannual scale makes it impossible to resolve individual solar cycles. Based on differentprocesses of formation and transport compared to cosmogenic isotopes, it provides new, independent insight into long-term solar activity and helps resolve the uncertainties related to cosmogenic isotopes as diagnostics of solar activity...|$|E
40|$|We {{carried out}} a {{vibration}} study experiment on a masonry building {{in the town of}} Ariano Irpino, southern Italy, using six-channel stations equipped with three-component velocity-transducers and accelerometers and running in continuous modality from January 2006 to December 2007. The analysis of weak motions from several local earthquakes, together with the 3 D numerical modelling of the structure, allowed us to identify the first three vibration modes of the target building. Therefore, we checked the validity of ambient noise data to determine the vibration frequencies of buildings. The analysis tools based on earthquake and ambient noise data were conventional, i. e. spectral ratios between homologous components of stations at high floors in the building with respect to a station installed at the basement, and single-station spectral ratios between horizontal and vertical components. The indications derived from earthquakes and ambient noise result in a satisfactory agreement for frequencies between 1 and 20 Hz when using recordings characterized by low levels of amplitude, both for cultural and <b>meteorological</b> <b>noise.</b> In contrast, when the wind speed increases (above 20 km/h, approximately) seismic noise shows an excess of horizontal vibrations at low frequencies (below 2 Hz). These extra-amplitudes are not related to the seismic input vertically incident to the basement, but are probably due to the lateral action of the wind on the building. In contrast anthropic activities do not affect considerably the trend of spectral ratios in the range of frequencies that include the first modes of vibration of the building, even at high noise level...|$|E
40|$|The {{indirect}} {{radiative forcing}} of aerosols is poorly {{constrained by the}} observational data underlying the simple cloud parameterizations in GCMs. signal of cloud response to increased aerosol concentrations from <b>meteorological</b> <b>noise.</b> Recent satellite observations indicate a significant decrease of cloud water in ship tracks, in contrast to an ensemble of in situ measurements showing no average change in cloud water relative to the surrounding clouds. Both results contradict the expectation of cloud water increasing in polluted clouds. We find through large-eddy simulations of stratocumulus that the trend in the satellite data is likely an artifact of sampling only overcast clouds. The simulations instead show cloud cover increasing with droplet concentrations. The simulations also show that increases in cloud water from suppressing drizzle by increased droplet concentrations are favored at night or at extremely low droplet concentrations. At typical droplet concentrations {{we find that the}} Twomey effect on cloud albedo is amplified very little by the secondary indirect effect of drizzle suppression, largely because the absorption of solar radiation by cloud water reduces boundary-layer mixing in the daytime and thereby restricts any possible increase in cloud water from drizzle suppression. The cloud and boundary layer respond to radiative heating variations on a time scale of hours, and on longer time scales respond to imbalances between large-scale horizontal advection and the entrainment of inversion air. We analyze the co-varying response of cloud water, cloud thickness, width of droplet size distributions, and dispersion of the optical depth, as well as the overall response of cloud albedo, to changes in droplet concentrations. We also dissect the underlying physical mechanisms through sensitivity studies. Ship tracks represent an ideal natural laboratory to extricate th...|$|E
