40|$|The {{apparent}} dissociation constants of {{carbonic acid}} in seawater were determined as functions of temperature (2 - 35 °C) and salinity (19 - 43 %) at atmospheric pressure by measurement of K’ 1 {{and the product}} K’, K’,. At 35 sa salinity and 25 °C the measured values were pE 1 = 6. 600 and pK’ 2 = 9. 115; at 35 % and 2 °C the measured values were pK’ 1 = 6. 177 and pKPz = 9. 431. We have determined the apparent dis-sociation constants of carbonic acid in sea-water at atmospheric pressure as functions of temperature and salinity, because of discrepancies in previous published results. These constants are defined (Lyman 1956) by equations I and 2 (Table 1). The paren-theses represent concentrations in <b>moles</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram</b> of seawater, arI is the hydrogen ion activity defined in the NBS buffer scale (Pytkowicz et al. 1966; Pytkowicz 1969), and C 02 * {{is the sum of}} the concentrations of molecular carbon dioxide and carbonic acid. The use of thermodynamic dissociation constants for the calculation of CO 2 species’ concentrations requires estimates of single ion activity coefficients, which are poorly known functions of temperature, salinity, pressure, and ion association. The direct determination of apparent constants in sea-water obviates this problem. Apparent constants depend on temperature, pressure, ion association, and on the free concen-trations of the major ions in seawater (Weyl 1961; Kester and Pytkowicz 1967). They are useful because the concentrations of the major ions are insensitive to changes in pH or to processes such as photosynthesis and the solution and precipitation of car-bonates. Essentially, apparent constants can be used for processes that do not hav...|$|R

40|$|The {{hydrogen}} (H{sub 2 }) {{gas generation}} rate for neptunium dioxide (NpO{sub 2 }) samples produced on a laboratory scale using the HB-Line Phase II flowsheet has been measured following exposure to 75 % relative humidity (RH). As expected, the observed H{sub 2 } generation rates for these samples increase with increasing moisture content. A maximum H{sub 2 } generation rate of 1. 8 x 10 {sup - 6 } <b>moles</b> <b>per</b> day <b>per</b> <b>kilogram</b> (mol {center_dot} day{sup - 1 } kg{sup - 1 }) was observed for NpO{sub 2 } samples with approximately one and one-half times (1 1 / 2 X) the expected specific surface area (SSA) for the HB-Line Phase II product. The SSA of NpO{sub 2 } samples calcined at 650 C {{is similar to}} plutonium dioxide (PuO{sub 2 }) calcined at 950 C according to the Department of Energy (DOE) standard for packaging and storage of PuO{sub 2 }.

40|$|We use {{computer}} simulations {{to investigate the}} effect of salt on homogeneous ice nucleation. The melting point of the employed solution model was obtained both by direct coexistence simulations and by thermodynamic integration from previous calculations of the water chemical potential. Using a Seeding approach, in which we simulate ice seeds embedded in a supercooled aqueous solution, we compute the nucleation rate {{as a function of}} temperature for a 1. 85 NaCl <b>mole</b> <b>per</b> water <b>kilogram</b> solution at 1 bar. To improve the accuracy and reliability of our calculations we combine Seeding with the direct computation of the ice-solution interfacial free energy at coexistence using the Mold Integration method. We compare the results with previous simulation work on pure water to understand the effect caused by the solute. The model captures the experimental trend that the nucleation rate at a given supercooling decreases when adding salt. Despite the fact that the thermodynamic driving force for ice nucleation is higher for salty water for a given supercooling, the nucleation rate slows down with salt due to a significant increase of the ice-fluid interfacial free energy. The salty water model predicts an ice nucleation rate that is in good agreement with experimental measurements, bringing confidence in the predictive ability of the model...|$|R

40|$|Amino acid salts {{have greater}} {{potential}} for CO₂ capture at high temperatures than typical amine-based absorbents {{because of their}} low volatility, high absorption rate, and high oxidative stability. The protonation constant (pKₐ) of an amino acid salt is crucial for CO₂ capture, as it decreases with increasing absorption temperature. However, published pKₐ values of amino acid salts have usually been determined at ambient temperatures. In this study, the pKₐ values of 11 amino acid salts were determined in the temperature range of 298 - 353 K using a potentiometric titration method. The standard-state molar enthalpies (ΔH⁰ m) and entropies (ΔS⁰ m) of the protonation reactions were also determined by the van't Hoff equation. It was found that sarcosine can maintain a higher pKₐ than the other amino acids studied at high temperatures. We {{also found that the}} CO₂ solubilities and overall mass-transfer coefficients of 5 m' sarcosinate (<b>moles</b> of sarcosine <b>per</b> <b>kilogram</b> of solution) at 333 - 353 K are higher than those of 30 % MEA at 313 - 353 K. These results show that some possible benefits can be produced from the use of sarcosine as a fast solvent for CO₂ absorption at high temperatures. However, the pronotation reaction of sarcosine is the least exothermic among those of all amino acids studied. This could lead to a high regeneration energy consumption in the sarcosinate-based CO 2 capture process...|$|R
