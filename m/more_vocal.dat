5|$|After Jefferson's {{retirement}} from public life in 1809, Adams became <b>more</b> <b>vocal.</b> He published a three-year marathon of {{letters in the}} Boston Patriot newspaper, refuting line-by-line an 1800 pamphlet by Hamilton which attacked his conduct and character. Though Hamilton had died in 1804 in a duel with Aaron Burr, Adams {{felt the need to}} vindicate his character against the New Yorker's vehement charges.|$|E
5|$|The call or croak of a frog {{is unique}} to its species. Frogs create this sound by passing air through the larynx in the throat. In most calling frogs, the sound is amplified by one or <b>more</b> <b>vocal</b> sacs, {{membranes}} of skin under the throat or {{on the corner of}} the mouth, that distend during the amplification of the call. Some frog calls are so loud that they can be heard up to a mile away.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the fifth}} edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), Tourette’s may be {{diagnosed}} when a person exhibits both multiple motor and one or <b>more</b> <b>vocal</b> tics over the period of a year; the motor and vocal tics need not be concurrent. The onset must have occurred {{before the age of}} 18, and cannot be attributed to the effects of another condition or substance (such as cocaine). Hence, other medical conditions that include tics or tic-like movements—such as autism or other causes of tourettism—must be ruled out before conferring a Tourette's diagnosis. Since 2000, the DSM has recognized that clinicians see patients who meet all the other criteria for Tourette's, but do not have distress or impairment.|$|E

5|$|International {{attitudes to}} the {{federation}} were critical, {{particularly from the}} Afro-Asian bloc in the United Nations. At {{a time when most}} colonial powers were rushing their colonies towards independence, the federation seemed to its opponents to be an unwelcome obstacle. In Britain, Labour grew more critical, and African nationalists in the federation itself became <b>more</b> <b>vocal,</b> dissatisfied with the liberalisation that was taking place, and demanding faster moves towards African advancement. The Governor of Northern Rhodesia, Sir Arthur Benson, wrote a secret letter to his superiors in Britain, highly critical of Welensky and the federation; this letter remained undiscovered until 1958, when Huggins revealed it to Welensky.|$|E
5|$|Like the sassabies, {{hartebeest}} produce quiet quacking and grunting sounds. Juveniles {{tend to be}} <b>more</b> <b>vocal</b> than adults, {{and produce}} a quacking call when alarmed or pursued. The hartebeest uses defecation as an olfactory and visual display. Herds are generally sedentary, and tend to migrate only under adverse conditions such as natural calamities. The hartebeest is the least migratory in the tribe Alcelaphini (which also includes wildebeest and sassabies), and also consumes {{the least amount of}} water and has the lowest metabolic rate among the members of the tribe.|$|E
5|$|Northeast Pacific {{resident}} groups {{tend to be}} much <b>more</b> <b>vocal</b> than transient {{groups in}} the same waters. Residents feed primarily on Chinook and chum salmon, species that are insensitive to killer whale calls (inferred from the audio-gram of Atlantic salmon). In contrast, the marine mammal prey of transients hear well underwater at the frequencies used in killer whale calls. As such, transients are typically silent, probably to avoid alerting their mammalian prey. They sometimes use a single click (called a cryptic click) rather than the long train of clicks observed in other populations. Residents are only silent when resting.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the main}} topics of debate after 's rampage became the way police dealt with him, {{especially}} whether the first two responding officers were, under the circumstances, supposed to immediately engage and neutralize the perpetrator, and whether the decision {{to wait for the}} arrival of the tactical unit was sound. The debate became <b>more</b> <b>vocal</b> after a cook, who managed to escape the rampage, claimed that she heard a slow series of single shots coming from the restaurant after the police had retreated. Another witness, who escaped unharmed, refuted this version of events, saying that shots were fired only during the initial ten minutes leading up to the point of police entry, with no shots heard thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Susanto Pudjomartono, {{former chief}} editor of Tempo, became The Jakarta Post second chief editor on 1 August 1991, after Siagian {{was chosen to}} be Indonesia's {{ambassador}} to Australia. Under Pudjomartono's leadership, the paper began publishing more original work and doing less translation; reporters {{were also asked to}} take {{a more active role in}} the day-to-day operations of the paper. The paper also became <b>more</b> <b>vocal</b> regarding politics, taking a pro-democracy stance like Tempo. It soon converted its offices into a new, two-story building built using the Kompas pension fund and expanded to 12 pages.|$|E
5|$|The Cowshed houses away fans at Prenton Park, {{and has a}} {{capacity}} of 2,500. It has a slanted seating arrangement, caused by the main road running behind it. It historically housed the <b>more</b> <b>vocal</b> home fans, but was switched to away supporters around {{the start of the}} 21st century. Since the change, a bar and TV screens {{have been added to the}} stand. The name is derived from its appearance before the redevelopment in 1995. With a 3 peak roof of corrugated iron, walls of wooden plank and a cinder bank floor it visually resembled an agricultural building.|$|E

5|$|The Jakarta Post {{was started}} as a {{collaboration}} between four Indonesian media under the urging of Information Minister Ali Murtopo and politician Jusuf Wanandi. After the first issue was printed on 25 April 1983, it spent several years with minimal advertisements and increasing circulation. After a change in chief editors in 1991, it began to take a <b>more</b> <b>vocal</b> pro-democracy point of view. The paper {{was one of the}} few Indonesian English-language dailies to survive the 1997 Asian financial crisis and currently has a circulation of about 40,000.|$|E
5|$|The black currawong is a {{loud and}} vocal species, {{and makes a}} variety of calls. Its main call is {{markedly}} different from the pied or grey currawongs and {{has been described as}} a combination of alternating kar and wheek sounds, killok killok, or even akin to part song and part human laughter. Although often noisy when flying in flocks, it can be silent when seeking prey or thieving food. Before or around dawn and at nightfall appear to be periods of increased calling, and birds are reported to be <b>more</b> <b>vocal</b> before rain or storms. Parents also make a long fluting whistle to summon their young.|$|E
5|$|This {{change was}} not welcomed {{by many people}} in Germany, who saw this new flag {{as a symbol of}} humiliation {{following}} Germany's defeat in the First World War. In the , the old colours continued to be used in various forms. Many conservatives wanted the old colours to return, while monarchists and the far right were far <b>more</b> <b>vocal</b> with their objections, referring to the new flag with various derogatory names (see Colour above). As a compromise, the old black-white-red flag was reintroduced in 1922 to represent German diplomatic missions abroad.|$|E

5000|$|According to Mr. Scruff, {{the album}} would [...] "display a stripped-back musicality, a depth that maybe hasn't been there before", and musically {{it would be}} [...] "tougher, sparser, with less samples, <b>more</b> bass. <b>More</b> <b>vocals</b> and collaborations and shorter tunes".|$|R
5|$|At {{the drivers}} meeting held the Friday before the event, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) Race Director Charlie Whiting {{announced}} that any potential blocking manoeuvres that {{interfered with the}} World Championship battle {{would result in a}} driver being shown a waved black and white flag, before giving a black flag to signal disqualification from the race. The penalty also had a potential ban for up to three Formula One World Championship events for any driver found to have breached the new ruling. Ralf Schumacher agreed with the penalties. However, McLaren team principal Ron Dennis was <b>more</b> <b>vocal</b> in opposing the new rules as he believed they were arbitrary and were against choosing team tactics. He was also unhappy with the inclusion of Italian lawyer Roberto Causo as a race steward because Dennis held the view that any decision would be biased towards Ferrari.|$|E
5|$|Family {{issues were}} {{significant}} concerns for lesbians when gay activism became <b>more</b> <b>vocal</b> in the 1960s and 1970s. Custody issues in particular were of interest since often courts would not award custody to mothers who were openly homosexual, {{even though the}} general procedure acknowledged children were awarded to the biological mother. Several studies performed {{as a result of}} custody disputes viewed how children grow up with same-sex parents compared to single mothers who did not identify as lesbians. They found that children's mental health, happiness, and overall adjustment is similar to children of divorced women who are not lesbians. Sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex roles of children who grow up with lesbian mothers are unaffected. Differences that were found include the fact that divorced lesbians tend to be living with a partner, fathers visit divorced lesbian mothers more often than divorced nonlesbian mothers, and lesbian mothers report a greater fear of losing their children through legal means.|$|E
5|$|On 29 January 2009, it was {{revealed}} that Newcastle had agreed a £4million fee with Bolton Wanderers, which was confirmed the next day, with Nolan travelling to Tyneside to discuss terms and undergo a medical. Nolan completed his move on the same day, signing a four and a half-year contract. On 22 February, Nolan received his first red card playing for Newcastle United in a home match against Everton for a two-footed foul on Victor Anichebe. At the end of the season, Newcastle were relegated to the English Championship. Nolan was noted as one of the <b>more</b> <b>vocal</b> Newcastle players over the summer, demanding an end to the off the field distractions at the club, and suggesting the club should be looking to acquire players for an immediate return to the Premier League.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of publication, the author, Stephen Lewis, aged 67 and living in Toronto, worked as the United Nations Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa, a {{position}} he held since 2001. Previously he worked as the Deputy Director of United Nations Children's Fund (1994–99), as the Canadian ambassador to the UN (1984–88), and {{as leader of the}} Ontario New Democratic Party (1970–79). After Lewis optimistically accepted the Special Envoy position he became increasingly distraught by the devastation he witnessed. Already a skilled orator, he became <b>more</b> <b>vocal</b> on the topic. He founded the Stephen Lewis Foundation, hosted Oprah Winfrey as she toured Africa, and was the subject of two award-winning documentaries by The Nature of Things, entitled Race Against Time and The Value of Life. Meanwhile he was appointed as a Companion of the Order of Canada, awarded the Pearson Medal of Peace, and named Canadian of the Year (2003) by MacLean's magazine. In 2005, he was invited to deliver the annual series of Massey Lectures from which the book, Race Against Time, was adapted. He wrote the text in early to mid- 2005 and delivered the lecture series in October when the book was released. Lewis wrote the book, not as an employee of the UN, but as a citizen concerned with the world's response to the AIDS challenge in Africa.|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{are much}} <b>more</b> <b>vocal,</b> {{especially}} during the breeding season when they use their voices to attract mates. The presence of a particular species in an area may be more easily discerned by its characteristic call than by a fleeting glimpse of the animal itself. In most species, the sound is produced by expelling air from the lungs over the vocal cords into an air sac or sacs in the throat or {{at the corner of}} the mouth. This may distend like a balloon and acts as a resonator, helping to transfer the sound to the atmosphere, or the water at times when the animal is submerged. The main vocalisation is the male's loud advertisement call which seeks to both encourage a female to approach and discourage other males from intruding on its territory. This call is modified to a quieter courtship call on the approach of a female or to a more aggressive version if a male intruder draws near. Calling carries the risk of attracting predators and involves the expenditure of much energy. Other calls include those given by a female in response to the advertisement call and a release call given by a male or female during unwanted attempts at amplexus. When a frog is attacked, a distress or fright call is emitted, often resembling a scream. The usually nocturnal Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) produces a rain call when there is rainfall during daylight hours.|$|E

50|$|Beginning with Cobra Starship's 2009 release Hot Mess, Blackinton self-produced Cobra's albums {{alongside}} Suarez.
