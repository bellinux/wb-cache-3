In spite of various arguments over {{the appropriateness of the}} term, Hittite remains the most current term by convention, although some authors <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> using Nesite or Neshite.|$|E
25|$|Ridership {{has been}} rising, and {{user-friendly}} features {{that have grown}} up through custom and practice help this. For instance, passengers open the doors by pressing a green strip on the central pole (in PCC trams) or an illuminated button (on Flexity trams), and drivers usually <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> waiting for latecomers. However, overcrowding at rush hours and at weekend is common. The rate of detected fare-dodging is 4.15%, despite periodic enforcement campaigns, and this is being addressed by the installation of ticket barriers in all metro stations. From 2013, the obligation to check out of as well as into the system is being progressively introduced.|$|E
500|$|After a preparatory {{school in}} Balham, Bax {{attended}} the Hampstead Conservatoire during the 1890s. The establishment was run – [...] "with considerable personal pomp", according to Bax – by Cecil Sharp, whose passion for English folk-song and folk-dance excited no response in his pupil. An enthusiasm for folk music was widespread among British composers {{of the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, including Parry, Stanford, Vaughan Williams and Holst; Sullivan and Elgar stood aloof, as did Bax, who later put into general circulation the saying, [...] "You should <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> trying every experience once, excepting incest and folk-dancing." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{familiarity}} with long-established Babylonian tropes {{suggests that the}} Cylinder was authored by the Babylonian priests of Marduk, working {{at the behest of}} Cyrus. It can be compared with another work of around the same time, the Verse Account of Nabonidus, in which the former Babylonian ruler is excoriated as the enemy of the priests of Marduk and Cyrus is presented as the liberator of Babylon. Both works <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> stressing Cyrus's qualifications as a king from a line of kings, in contrast to the non-royal ancestry of Nabonidus, who is described by the Cylinder as merely maţû, [...] "insignificant".|$|E
500|$|In October 1919, the newspaper's {{headquarters}} {{moved to}} Cluj, and Agârbiceanu followed. Thanks to his literary activity, {{he was part}} of the leadership of the Romanian Writers' Society, and was elected corresponding member of the Romanian Academy in 1919. He also began contributing to the reviews Gândirea of Cluj, and Flacăra and Cuget Românesc of Bucharest. In 1922, he accompanied other Writers' Society members on a celebratory tour of Transylvania. Like several of his colleagues, Agârbiceanu preserved a bitter memory of the war, and his articles of the time <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> referring to the Hungarians as a [...] "barbarian horde".|$|E
500|$|Deep Purple debuted at The Roundhouse Theatre in London on 6 July 1968, {{opening for}} The Byrds, before The Gun and The Deviants. Their {{performance}} was badly {{received by the}} audience and by other attending musicians, including Mick Jagger. In spite of this, the band went on playing their live set in local pubs and festivals, but were received coldly and ignored by the press. In an interview with Melody Maker, Ian Paice explained that their lack of touring and promotion in England {{was due to the}} low wages they were offered and {{to the fact that they}} had very few danceable numbers to attract audience. He stressed that [...] "we <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> warning promoters that we are not a dancing group." ...|$|E

In October 2012, in an interview with Allure, Conrad stated that while [...] "the story told wasn't a dishonest one, the way [...] did it sometimes was". She elaborated that scenes would be reenacted if cameras were not present for a significant occurrence between cast members, and commented that her relationship with Jenner was [...] "pretty brief" [...] and [...] "definitely [...] to drag it out". In July 2013, when discussing the filming of several alternate finale endings, MTV acknowledged that [...] "maybe the term 'reality TV' didn't perfectly apply to The Hills".|$|E
500|$|American {{science fiction}} {{magazines}} had by the mid-1930s begun to publish some more sophisticated stories than the straightforward adventure fiction {{that was a}} staple of the earliest years of the genre. [...] Gillings decided that many British science fiction readers would not be familiar with most of the developments in American sf, and so he did not <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> seeking innovative and original material. [...] The first issue contained [...] "The Perfect Creature", an early story by John Wyndham, under the name [...] "John Beynon", as well as [...] "The Prr-r-eet", by Eric Frank Russell. [...] The second issue included Wyndham's novel Sleepers of Mars, and William F. Temple's [...] "Lunar Lilliput", which was Temple's first science fiction sale. [...] "Stenographer's Hands", a story by David H. Keller, also appeared in the second issue, reprinted from a U.S. magazine; Gillings claimed that this was to introduce British science fiction readers to American developments in sf, but in fact it was because he was having trouble obtaining good quality material from British writers.|$|E
500|$|The Soviets had few {{operable}} ICBMs; {{in spite}} of this Khrushchev publicly boasted of the Soviets' missile programs, stating that Soviet weapons were varied and numerous. The First Secretary hoped that public perception that the Soviets were ahead would result in psychological pressure on the West and political concessions. The Soviet space program, which Khrushchev firmly supported, appeared to confirm his claims when the Soviets launched Sputnik 1 into orbit, a launch many westerners, including United States Vice President Richard Nixon were convinced was a hoax. When {{it became clear that the}} launch was real, and Sputnik 1 was in orbit, Western governments concluded that the Soviet ICBM program was further along than it actually was. Khrushchev added to this misapprehension by stating in an October 1957 interview that the USSR had all the rockets, of whatever capacity, that it needed. For years, Khrushchev would <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> preceding a major foreign trip with a rocket launch, to the discomfiture of his hosts. The United States learned of the primitive state of the Soviet missile program from overflights in the late 1950s, but only high U.S. officials knew of the deception. In January 1960, Khrushchev told the Presidium that Soviet ICBMs made an agreement with the U.S. possible because [...] "main-street Americans have begun to shake from fear for the first times in their lives". The perceived [...] "missile gap" [...] led to a considerable defense buildup on the part of the United States.|$|E

The old version is, therefore, usually called the [...] "Sephardic". The old and the new versions are sometimes found side by side. Because it is traditional to recite Kol Nidrei three times, some Sephardic communities, and even some Ashkenazic communities (especially in Israel) <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> reciting both versions (usually referring to the previous Yom Kippur in the first two iterations and the next Yom Kippur in the third).|$|E

2500|$|The beatification of St. Teresa Benedicta as {{a martyr}} {{generated}} criticism. Critics argued {{that she was}} murdered because she was Jewish by birth, rather than for her Catholic faith, and that, {{in the words of}} Daniel Polish, the beatification seemed to [...] "carry the tacit message encouraging conversionary activities" [...] because [...] "official discussion of the beatification seemed to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> conjoining Stein's Catholic faith with her death with 'fellow Jews' in Auschwitz". The position of the Catholic Church is that St. Teresa Benedicta also died because of the Dutch episcopacy's public condemnation of Nazi racism in 1942; in other words, that she died because of the moral teaching of the Church and is thus a true martyr.|$|E
2500|$|Trible allocates another {{chapter in}} Texts of Terror to Tamar, subtitled [...] "The Royal Rape of Wisdom." [...] She noted that Tamar is the lone female in the {{narrative}} and is treated {{as part of the}} stories of Amnon and Absalom. [...] "Two males surround a female. As the story unfolds, they move between protecting and polluting, supporting and seducing, comforting and capturing her. Further, these sons of David compete with each other through the beautiful woman." [...] She also wrote that the language the original Hebrew uses to describe the rape is better translated as [...] "He laid her" [...] than [...] "He lay with her." [...] Scholz wrote that [...] "Many scholars <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> rejecting the brutality with which Amnon subdues his sister," [...] going on to criticize an interpretation by Pamela Tamarkin Reis that blames Tamar, rather than Amnon, for what happened to her.|$|E
2500|$|Yom Kippur, ("Day of Atonement") is the holiest {{day of the}} Jewish year. It is a day of {{communal}} fasting and praying for forgiveness for one's sins. Observant Jews spend the entire day in the synagogue, sometimes with a short break in the afternoon, reciting prayers from a special holiday prayerbook called a [...] "Machzor". Many non-religious Jews <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> attending synagogue services and fasting on Yom Kippur. On the eve of Yom Kippur, before candles are lit, a prefast meal, the [...] "seuda mafseket", is eaten. Synagogue services {{on the eve of}} Yom Kippur begin with the Kol Nidre prayer. It is customary to wear white on Yom Kippur, especially for Kol Nidre, and leather shoes are not worn. The following day, prayers are held from morning to evening. The final prayer service, called [...] "Ne'ilah", ends with a long blast of the shofar.|$|E

2500|$|Mbeki has {{sometimes}} been characterised as remote and academic, although in his second campaign for the Presidency in 2004, many observers described him as finally relaxing into more traditional ways of campaigning, sometimes dancing at events and even kissing babies. [...] Mbeki used his weekly column in the ANC newsletter ANC Today, to produce discussions {{on a variety of}} topics. He sometimes used his column to deliver pointed invectives against political opponents, and at other times used {{it as a kind of}} professor of political theory, educating ANC cadres on the intellectual justifications for African National Congress policy. Although these columns were remarkable for their dense prose, they often were used to influence news. Although Mbeki did not generally <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> befriending or courting reporters, his columns and news events often yielded good results for his administration by ensuring that his message is a primary driving force of news coverage.|$|E

2500|$|The False Dmitry {{is one of}} {{the primary}} {{characters}} in Alexander Pushkin's blank verse drama Boris Godunov. In Pushkin's drama, the character is a young novice monk who decides to impersonate the Tsarevich when he hears they would have been the same age had the child lived. Pushkin's decision to humanise the False Dmitry earned him the disapproval of Tsar Nicholas I of Russia, who then prevented the play from being published or staged. In an unpublished foreword, Pushkin wrote, [...] "There is much of Henri IV in Dmitri. Like him he is brave, generous and boastful, like him indifferent to religion -- both abjure their faith for a political cause, both love pleasures and war, both devote themselves to chimerical projects, both are victims of conspiracies... But Henri IV didn't have a Ksenya on his conscience -- it is true that this horrible accusation hasn't been proved and, as for me, I <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> not believing it." [...] Pushkin intended to write further plays about the reigns of Dmitry and Vasili, as well as the subsequent Time of Troubles. Pushkin was prevented from fulfilling these plans by his death in a duel at the age of 37.|$|E
