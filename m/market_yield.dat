Once the <b>market</b> <b>yields</b> are adjusted, they can be used to calculate implied forward rates for a series of dates in the future.

50|$|S. subterranea {{currently}} has no effective chemical controls. Therefore, other cultural management techniques must be used. Using certified clean seeds and planting in fields {{that have been}} historically healthy is the best form of control. These methods may prevent infestation from resting spores. Since infection is promoted by cool soil temperatures and high soil moisture, delayed planting can also help reduce negative effects of the pathogen. Delayed planting reduces the growth period in cooler soils subsequently decreaseing germination of the spores. One limitation to this method is an additional decrease of early <b>market</b> <b>yield.</b> Pre-planting chemigation with metam sodium can reduce the propagules of the pathogen. Other common means of control include using resistant potatoes and crop rotations. Several cultivars of resistant potatoes include Granola, Nicola, Ditta, and Gladiator. Because soil-borne inoculum can survive for many years, crop rotations should involve alternate species that will promote a partial life cycle of the pathogen. This way the zoospores will germinate without producing new spores. Researchers have investigated the use of beta-aminobutyric acid (BABA) in promoting potato resistance. BABA triggers a plants systemic acquired resistance (SAR), a natural plant defense mechanism. When potatoes are inoculated with BABA and then later inoculated with the pathogen, S. subterranean, they exhibit overall reduction in disease. While pathogen reduction has been experimentally supported, further experimentation needs to be performed.|$|E
50|$|In {{synthetic}} transactions, {{credit risk}} of the Reference Portfolio is transferred to the SPV via credit default swaps. For each name in the portfolio the SPV enters into a credit default swap where the SPV sells credit protection to the bank {{in return for a}} periodically paid premium. The cash raised from the sale of the various classes of notes, i.e.; Class A, B, C and D in the above example, is placed in collateral securities. Typically these are AAA rated notes issued by supranationals, governments, governmental organizations, or covered bonds (Pfandbrief). These are low-risk instruments with a return slightly below the interbank <b>market</b> <b>yield.</b> If there is a default in the portfolio, the credit default swap for that entity is triggered and the bank demands the loss suffered for that entity from the SPV. For example if the bank has entered into a credit default swap for $10,000,000 on Company A and this company is bankrupt the bank will demand $10,000,000 less the recovery amount from the SPV. The recovery amount is the secondary market price of $10,000,000 of bonds of Company A after bankruptcy. Typically recovery amount is assumed to be 40% but this number changes depending on the credit cycle, industry type, and depending on the company in question. Hence, if recovery amount is $4,000,000 (working on 40% recovery assumption), the bank receives $6,000,000 from the SPV. In order to pay this money, the SPV has to liquidate some collateral securities to pay the bank. Having lost some assets, the SPV has to reduce some liabilities as well and it does so by reducing the notional of the equity notes. Hence, after the first default in the portfolio, the equity notes, i.e.; Class D notes in the above example are reduced to $24,000,000 from $30,000,000.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{estimate}} the factors underlying {{the volatility of}} the euro overnight interest rate and its transmission along the euro area money <b>market</b> <b>yield</b> curve. A new multivariate unobserved components model is proposed allowing for both long-memory and stationary cyclical dynamics. Using hourly data the estimates show repetitive intradaily and monthly patterns that {{can be explained by}} the microstructure of the money market and the institutional features of the Eurosystem's operational framework for monetary policy implementation. Strong persistence is dedected in all log-volatility processes and two common long-memory factors are extracted. The first factor explains the long-memory dynamics of the shortest maturity. The second factor explains the transmission of volatility along the money <b>market</b> <b>yield</b> curve. We find evidence that most liquidity effects are cyclical, confined to the ned of reserve maintenance periods, and are not transmitted along the money <b>market</b> <b>yield</b> curve.

40|$|The paper {{studies the}} euro area money market from a {{microstructure}} perspective. The {{focus is on}} the empirical estimation of the factors underlying the volatility of the overnight interest rate and its transmission along the money <b>market</b> <b>yield</b> curve. Two sources of volatility are separated out, one related to the institutional features of the operational framework and payments system, and the other, related to the impact of policy decisions. A novel data set is used composed of hourly observations and covering several short-term interest rates. The sample runs from 4 / 12 / 2000 to 31 / 05 / 2002. Two common long-memory factors are found to drive the volatility processes. The first explains the long-memory dynamics of the shortest maturity. The other explains the transmission of volatility to other maturities. It is shown that announcements of interest rate changes exercise the strongest impact on the volatility of the shortest maturities. Persistent effects of liquidity shortages that are transmitted along the money <b>market</b> <b>yield</b> curve are documented. However, these effects are not the rule and can be explained by exceptional circumstances. Money market microstructure, stochastic volatility, fractional integration and cointegration,...|$|E
