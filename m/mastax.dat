30|$|In {{the present}} research, {{a total of}} 25 adult {{specimens}} of two new Milnesium species: M. argentinum (18 specimens) and M. beatae (7 specimens) were studied. Both species {{were found in the}} same region of Nahuel Huapi National Park (Río Negro Province, Argentina) in a few moss samples. Five specimens (two specimens of M. argentinum sp. nov. and three specimens of M. beatae sp. nov.) were found with the remnants of food (rotifer <b>mastaxes</b> and tardigrade buccal apparatuses and claws) in their guts. Both species were found in the moss samples (sometimes also together in the same piece of moss) that also contained rotifers, nematodes and other tardigrades (Diphascon chilenense Plate, 1888, Echiniscus bigranulatus Richters 1907, Hebesuncus mollispinus Pilato et al. 2012, Macrobiotus cf. andinus, M. harmsworthi group, M. kazmierskii Kaczmarek and Michalczyk 2009, M. patagonicus Maucci 1988, M. szeptyckii Kaczmarek and Michalczyk 2009, Mopsechiniscus granulosus Mihelčič 1967). Both new Milnesium species were able to choose from the same type of prey, because the prey were similar in every sample.|$|R

50|$|Included {{with the}} genus description, the paper {{contained}} {{the description of}} Avitomyrmex <b>mastax,</b> Avitomyrmex systenus, and the type species Avitomyrmex elongatus. These fossil species {{date back to the}} Middle Ypresian.|$|E
5000|$|The second species {{described}} {{from the}} McAbee Fossil Beds is A. <b>mastax</b> which, unlike A. elongatus, is known from two specimens. The holotype and paratype are both {{included in the}} Thompson Rivers University, Kamloops collections as UCCIPRL-18 F-850 and UCCIPRL-18 F-929 respectively. The holotype specimen is a partial queen which is incomplete, with one forewing and the head fairly preserved, and the other isolated body portions indistinct. The paratype is a mostly complete queen missing parts of her gaster, legs and hind wings. Overall the species is estimated to have been 15 millimetres (0.6 inches) long and has a forewing length of 13 millimetres (0.5 inches). A. <b>mastax</b> is distinguishable from the other species in Avitomyrmex by its smaller mandible size, being {{less than half the}} length of the head with eight teeth, and additionally the shape of the head capsule. The specimen also has large compound eyes. The specific epithet <b>mastax</b> is from the Greek [...] "mastax" [...] meaning [...] "jaw" [...] or [...] "mandible", a reference to the small size of the mandibles compared to the other species of Avitomyrmex.|$|E
50|$|The coronal cilia {{create a}} current that sweeps food into the mouth. The mouth opens into a {{characteristic}} chewing pharynx (called the <b>mastax),</b> sometimes via a ciliated tube, and sometimes directly. The pharynx {{has a powerful}} muscular wall and contains tiny, calcified, jaw-like structures called trophi, which are the only fossilizable parts of a rotifer. The shape of the trophi varies between different species, depending partly {{on the nature of}} their diet. In suspension feeders, the trophi are covered in grinding ridges, while in more actively carnivorous species, they may be shaped like forceps to help bite into prey. In some ectoparasitic rotifers, the <b>mastax</b> is adapted to grip onto the host, although, in others, the foot performs this function instead.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mastax</b> vegeta is {{a species}} of beetle in the Carabidae family {{that can be found}} in such Indian provinces as Darjeeling, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim and Uttarakhand. In Uttarrakhand it was found {{north-northeast}} of Ramnagar in the valley near Kosi River. The species have brown pronotum and yellow dots on its black body.|$|E
50|$|Behind the <b>mastax</b> lies an oesophagus, {{which opens}} into a stomach {{where most of}} the {{digestion}} and absorption occurs. The stomach opens into a short intestine that terminates in a cloaca on the posterior dorsal surface of the animal. Up to seven salivary glands are present in some species, emptying to the mouth in front of the oesophagus, while the stomach is associated with two gastric glands that produce digestive enzymes.|$|E
50|$|Rotifers {{have a small}} brain, {{located just}} above the <b>mastax,</b> from which a number of nerves extend {{throughout}} the body. The number of nerves varies between species, although the nervous system usually has a simple layout. Close to the brain lies a retrocerebral organ, consisting of two glands {{either side of a}} medial sac. The sac drains into a duct that divides into two before opening through pores on the uppermost part of the head. The function of the retrocerebral organ is unclear.|$|E
50|$|Megamastax is a genus of lobe-finned fish which lived {{during the}} late Silurian period, about 423 million years ago. The generic name of Megamastax is Greek for 'big mouth' coming from megalos (big) and <b>mastax</b> (mouth). Fossils of Megamastax were found at Kuanti Formation in Qujing, Yunnan, China. Before the {{discovery}} of Megamastax, {{it was thought that}} jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes) were limited in size and variation before the Devonian period. Megamastax is known only from jaw bones and it is estimated that it reached about 1 m long.|$|E
50|$|Adult Floscularia ringens make {{parthenogenetic}} {{eggs that}} {{are kept in}} the tube. After the eggs hatch, the young stay in the maternal tube for {{a little time to}} finish developing before swimming off. A young Floscularia ringens has a cone-shaped body, short foot, little corona, and <b>mastax</b> with trophi, but it still seems to not be able to eat. In less than one day, the young Floscularia ringens makes a lasting connection to a substrate. Its corona now has four lobes, and the foot lengthens. After the corona develops the Floscularia ringens starts to eat through making currents, and it also begins to create its tube.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{characters}} which separate Avitomyrmex from other ant genera. The most notable {{feature is the}} distinctly slender nature of the queens and workers morphology. This is shown clearly {{in the shape of}} the petiole connecting the thorax and the abdomen. While similar to the modern myrmeciine genus Nothomyrmecia of Southern Australia, the two genera are distinguishable by the structure of the petiole, with Avitomyrmex lacking the peduncle seen in Nothomyrmecia. The eyes are large and well developed, the mandibles are subtriangular but poorly preserved, and a sting is present on examined A. systenus fossils. As for A. elongatus and A. <b>mastax,</b> it is unknown if the two ants have a sting, due to either poor preservation or the sting has not been preserved at all.|$|E
5000|$|Of {{the three}} {{described}} species of Avitomyrmex {{found at the}} McAbee Fossil Beds, only A. systenus is known from worker caste specimens. The holotype is currently deposited in the Courtenay and District Museum paleontology collections as 2003.2.11 CDM 035 while the paratype, UCCIPR L-18 F-989, and an additional hypotype worker, UCCIPR L-18 F-825, which is tentatively assigned to the species are both deposited in Thompson Rivers University collections. Based on the mostly complete workers, mature specimens are estimated to have been 15 millimetres (0.6 inches). Due {{to the size of}} adult workers they cannot be attributed to A. elongatus while the overall petiole, head capsule and mandible structure distinguish it from A. <b>mastax.</b> The eyes are large and one-third the length of the head, and the legs are indistinctly preserved but long. The pronotum is almost flat, and the gaster is narrow. The shape of the head was the basis for Archibald, Cover and Moreau choosing the specific epithet systenus, which is from the Greek word systenos meaning [...] "tapering to a point".|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{nervous system}} of the benthic {{freshwater}} rotifer, Notommata copeus, was examined using antibody probes, epifluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy, and digital imaging to highlight similarities with other monogonont rotifers. Immunoreactivity to anti-FMRFamide (Phe–Met–Arg–Phe–NH 2),-SCPb (small cardioactive peptide b), and-serotonin (5 -HT, 5 -hydroxytryptamine) was present in the central, peripheral, and stoma-togastric nervous system. Specifically, anti-FMRFamide and-SCPb staining was abundant in perikarya and neurites of the cerebral ganglion, ventrolateral nerve cords, and <b>mastax.</b> In ad-dition, a single loop-like neurite was present in between the nerve cords at the posterior end of the body. Serotonergic neurites were also abundant, and highlighted several cerebral pathways that included connections to the nerve cords and possibly the <b>mastax.</b> Novel neural pathways were also present in the posterior trunk region, where serotonergic neurites innervated the foot and lateral body wall. The results presented herein also highlight the utility of 3 D visualization software to gain further insights into the organization and architecture of the rotifer cerebral ganglion.

40|$|Filtration {{abilities}} of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts by rotifers (Brachionus calyciflorus) were studied. The filtration rate of rotifers is quick: {{the passage of}} oocysts through the digestive system is few minutes only. During the first 10 minutes 24300 of whole amount one million oocysts passed through the digestive system of 100 rotifers. Moreover, 93 % of oocysts were death after passage. All oocysts expelled were unable to infect suckling BALB/c mice. Oocysts were degraded in <b>mastax,</b> stomach and intestine. Rotifers can be use for detection of cryptosporidia oocysts in water and they effectively decrease their numbers...|$|E
