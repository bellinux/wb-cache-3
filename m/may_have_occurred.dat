5|$|Cabbage was {{probably}} domesticated later in history than Near Eastern {{crops such as}} lentils and summer wheat. Because of {{the wide range of}} crops developed from the wild B.oleracea, multiple broadly contemporaneous domestications of cabbage <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> throughout Europe. Nonheading cabbages and kale were probably the first to be domesticated, before 1000 BC, by the Celts of central and western Europe.|$|E

5|$|Hashimoto's {{thyroiditis}} is an autoimmune {{disorder in}} which the thyroid gland is infltrated by the lymphocytes B-cell and T-cells. These progressively destroy the thyroid gland. In this way, Hasimoto's thyroiditis <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> insidiously, and only be noticed when thyroid hormone production decreases, causing symptoms of hypothyroidism. Hashimoto's {{is more common in}} females than males, much more common after the age of 60, and has known genetic risk factors. Also more common in individuals with Hashimoto's thyroiditis are type 1 diabetes, pernicious anaemia, Addison's disease vitiligo.|$|E
5|$|Most {{amphibians}} today remain semiaquatic, {{living the}} first stage of their lives as fish-like tadpoles. Several groups of tetrapods, such as the snakes and cetaceans, have lost some or all of their limbs. In addition, many tetrapods have returned to partially aquatic or fully aquatic lives throughout the history of the group (modern examples of fully aquatic tetrapods include cetaceans and sirenians). The first returns to an aquatic lifestyle <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> as early as the Carboniferous Period whereas other returns occurred as recently as the Cenozoic, as in cetaceans, pinnipeds, and several modern amphibians.|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994 demonstrated that gravitational interactions can fragment a comet, {{giving rise to}} many impacts {{over a period of}} a few days if the comet should collide with a planet. Comets undergo gravitational interactions with the gas giants, and similar disruptions and collisions are very likely to have occurred in the past. This scenario <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> on Earth {{at the end of the}} Cretaceous, though Shiva and the Chicxulub craters might have been formed 300,000 years apart.|$|E

5|$|The letter proved prophetic of Chekhov's marital {{arrangements}} with Olga: he lived largely at Yalta, she in Moscow, pursuing her acting career. In 1902, Olga suffered a miscarriage; and Donald Rayfield has offered evidence, {{based on the}} couple's letters, that conception <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> when Chekhov and Olga were apart, although Russian scholars have rejected that claim. The literary legacy of this long-distance marriage is a correspondence that preserves gems of theatre history, including shared complaints about Stanislavski's directing methods and Chekhov's advice to Olga about performing in his plays.|$|E
5|$|There are {{no reports}} of {{dopamine}} in archaea, {{but it has been}} detected in some types of bacteria and in the protozoan called Tetrahymena. Perhaps more importantly, there are types of bacteria that contain homologs of all the enzymes that animals use to synthesize dopamine. It has been proposed that animals derived their dopamine-synthesizing machinery from bacteria, via horizontal gene transfer that <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> relatively late in evolutionary time, perhaps {{as a result of the}} symbiotic incorporation of bacteria into eukaryotic cells that gave rise to mitochondria.|$|E
5|$|Alberto {{produced}} {{winds of}} tropical storm force along the South Carolina coastline; the highest official wind gust was 51mph (82km/h) at Edisto Beach. The storm dropped precipitation {{across much of}} the state, including a state maximum of 4.42inches (112mm) at Pritchardville. Storm tides reached 7.81feet (2.4m) above the mean low-level water mark along Fripp Island, leading to some beach erosion along portions of the coastline. While in the process of becoming extratropical, the rainbands of Alberto spawned seven confirmed tornadoes in the state, most of which rated F0; a National Weather Service report indicated additional tornadoes <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> in the state. The tornadoes caused some minor damage, though overall damage in the state was minimal.|$|E

5|$|Most of the UB I {{boats were}} shipped to their port of {{operations}} by rail, where they were assembled, launched, tested, and commissioned. Information on UB-14 suggests that she may not have followed that pattern as closely as most other boats. According to several sources, UB-14 was launched on 23 March 1915, and commissioned into the German Imperial Navy as SM UB-14 on 25 March {{under the command of}} Oberleutnant zur See Heino von Heimburg a 25-year-old first-time U-boat commander. Those same sources are silent on UB-14s whereabouts at the time, but information on UB-14 later shipment and arrival in the Mediterranean suggest that her initial launch and commissioning <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> in Germany.|$|E
5|$|Publication of the 1980 paper brought {{criticism}} from the geologic community, and an often acrimonious scientific debate ensued. Ten years later, and after Alvarez's death, evidence of a large impact crater called Chicxulub was found {{off the coast of}} Mexico, providing support for the theory. Other researchers later found that the end-Cretaceous extinction of the dinosaurs <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> rapidly in geologic terms, over thousands of years, rather than millions of years as had previously been supposed. Others continue to study alternative extinction causes such as increased volcanism, particularly the massive Deccan Traps eruptions that occurred around the same time, and climate change, checking against the fossil record. However, on March 4, 2010, a panel of 41 scientists agreed that the Chicxulub asteroid impact triggered the mass extinction.|$|E
5|$|The geology of Titania was {{influenced}} by two competing forces: impact crater formation and endogenic resurfacing. The former acted over the moon's entire history and influenced all surfaces. The latter processes were also global in nature, but active mainly for a period following the moon's formation. They obliterated the original heavily cratered terrain, explaining the relatively low number of impact craters on the moon's present-day surface. Additional episodes of resurfacing <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> later {{and led to the}} formation of smooth plains. Alternatively smooth plains may be ejecta blankets of the nearby impact craters. The most recent endogenous processes were mainly tectonic in nature and caused the formation of the canyons, which are actually giant cracks in the ice crust. The cracking of the crust was caused by the global expansion of Titania by about 0.7%.|$|E

5|$|This {{hypothesis}} {{was viewed as}} radical when first proposed, but additional evidence soon emerged. The boundary clay {{was found to be}} full of minute spherules of rock, crystallized from droplets of molten rock formed by the impact. Shocked quartz and other minerals were also identified in the K–Pg boundary. Shocked minerals have their internal structure deformed, and are created by intense pressures such as those associated with nuclear blasts or meteorite impacts. The identification of giant tsunami beds along the Gulf Coast and the Caribbean also provided evidence for impact, and suggested that the impact <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> nearby—as did the discovery that the K–Pg boundary became thicker in the southern United States, with meter-thick beds of debris occurring in northern New Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Tracing {{back the}} comet's orbital motion {{revealed}} {{that it had}} been orbiting Jupiter for some time. It is likely that it was captured from a solar orbit in the early 1970s, although the capture <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> as early as the mid-1960s. Several other observers found images of the comet in precovery images obtained before March 24, including Kin Endate from a photograph exposed on March 15, S. Otomo on March 17, and a team led by Eleanor Helin from images on March 19. No precovery images dating back to earlier than March 1993 have been found. Before the comet was captured by Jupiter, it was probably a short-period comet with an aphelion just inside Jupiter's orbit, and a perihelion interior to the asteroid belt.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} storm was first observed by a ship about 835mi (1,345km) northeast of Cayenne, French Guiana, early on August6, according to historic weather maps. However, {{the scarcity of}} observations means that its genesis <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> earlier than this time and been undetected operationally. With initial winds of 60mph (95km/h), the system moved generally west-northwestward and strengthened into Category1 hurricane on the modern day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale about 24hours later. The first indication of the storm {{to the east of}} Barbados was on August8 via telegraph reports. Early on August9, the cyclone struck Martinique as either a strong Category1 or a weak Category2 hurricane. The storm entered the Caribbean Sea shortly thereafter. Around 12:00UTC, the cyclone intensified into a Category3 hurricane, becoming the first major hurricane in the Atlantic basin since the second storm of 1900 and the first in the Caribbean Sea since the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane.|$|E
5|$|According to Cloud {{and other}} modern {{professional}} historians of Roman history, {{a fundamental shift}} in the punishment of murderers <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> {{towards the end of}} the third century BCE, possibly spurred on by specific incidents like that of Lucius Hostius' murder of his father, and, more generally, occasioned by the concomitant brutalization of society in the wake of the protracted wars with Hannibal. Previously, murderers would have been handed over to the family of the victim to exact their vengeance, whereas from the second century BCE and onwards, the punishment of murderers became the affair of the Roman state, rather than, that is, that the offended family was given full licence in how to mete out what they deemed to be an appropriate punishment to the murderer of a family member. Within that particular context, Cloud points out, specifically, that certain jokes contained in the plays of the early 2nd century dramatist Plautus may be read to refer to the recent introduction of the punishment by the sack for parricides in particular (without the animals involved).|$|E
