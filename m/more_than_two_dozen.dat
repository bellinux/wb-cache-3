Still, some individuals score very differently when taking the same test at different times or when taking more than one kind of IQ test at the same age. For example, many children in the famous longitudinal Genetic Studies of Genius begun in 1921 by Lewis Terman showed declines in IQ as they grew up. Terman recruited school pupils based on referrals from teachers, and gave them his Stanford–Binet IQ test. Children with an IQ above 140 by that test {{were included in the}} study.

He received several serious wounds under heavy fire by the North Vietnamese while trying to reload. Although mortally wounded, Sabo crawled forward toward the enemy emplacement, pulled the pin of a grenade, and threw it at the last possible second toward an enemy bunker. The resulting explosion silenced the enemy bunker at the cost of Sabo's life. In all, seven {{other members of the}} platoon were killed in this ambush and another 28 were wounded.

40|$|International audienceTrinucleotide repeat {{expansions}} {{are responsible}} for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>dozens</b> severe neurological disorders in humans. A double-strand break between two short CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeats was formerly shown to induce a high frequency of repeat contractions in yeast. Here, using a dedicated TALEN, we show that induction of a double-strand break into a CAG/ CTG trinucleotide repeat in heterozygous yeast diploid cells results in gene conversion of the repeat tract with near 100 % efficacy, deleting the repeat tract. Induction of the same TALEN in homozygous yeast diploids leads to contractions of both repeats to a final length of 3 – 13 triplets, with 100 % efficacy in cells that survived the double-strand breaks. Whole-genome sequencing of surviving yeast cells shows that the TALEN does not increase mutation rate. No other CAG/CTG repeat of the yeast genome showed any length alteration or mutation. No large genomic rearrangement such as aneuploidy, segmental duplication or translocation was detected. It is the first demonstration that induction of a TALEN in an eukaryotic cell leads to shortening of trinucleotide repeat tracts to lengths below pathological thresholds in humans, with 100 % efficacy and very high specificity...|$|R

40|$|Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is {{a highly}} disseminated angiogenic tumor of endothelial cells linked to {{infection}} by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). KSHV encodes <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>dozens</b> of miRNAs but their roles in KSHV-induced tumor dissemination and metastasis remain unknown. Here, we found that ectopic expression of miR-K 12 - 3 (miR-K 3) promoted endothelial cell migration and invasion. Bioinformatics and luciferase reporter analyses showed that miR-K 3 directly targeted G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinase 2 (GRK 2, official gene symbol ADRBK 1). Importantly, overexpression of GRK 2 reversed miR-K 3 induction of cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, the chemokine receptor CXCR 2, which was negatively regulated by GRK 2, was upregulated in miR-K 3 -transduced endothelial cells. Knock down of CXCR 2 abolished miR-K 3 -induced cell migration and invasion. Moreover, miR-K 3 downregulation of GRK 2 relieved its direct inhibitory effect on AKT. Both CXCR 2 induction {{and the release of}} AKT from GRK 2 were required for miR-K 3 maximum activation of AKT and induction of cell migration and invasion. Finally, deletion of miR-K 3 from the KSHV genome abrogated its effect on the GRK 2 /CXCR 2 /AKT pathway and KSHV-induced migration and invasion. Our data provide the first-line evidence that, by repressing GRK 2, miR-K 3 facilitates cell migration and invasion via activation of CXCR 2 /AKT signaling, which likely contribute to the dissemination of KSHV-induced tumors...|$|R

Prior to World War I, Budapest became a hot spot and driving force stimulating the economy of late Austrian-Hungarian Empire. Budapest then benefited from the cities tolerant atmosphere and open minded civil society, attracting migrants from rural villages in the provinces of Hungary – to settle in the city and to accomodate to the cities civil society as residents, merchants, lawyers, doctors, musicians or scientists (see the novels of Elias Canneti).

40|$|The Red Sea is a {{textbook}} {{case of a}} modern-day oceanic rift basin forming {{as a result of}} continental break-up. A characteristic feature of this setting in the central and northern Red Sea are <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>dozens</b> of isolated bathymetric depressions, "deeps", filled with brines derived from leaching of the early-breakup Miocene salt deposits that lie beneath the entire Red Sea. The Atlantis II Deep is the largest basin of this type in the axial rift zone of the Red Sea. A topographic depression enclosing a volume of an estimated 15 km 3 at water depths from 1900 to 2200 m, the Atlantis II Deep contains layered fluids with temperatures of up to 66 °C and salinities of up to 27 %. Beneath the brines, up to 30 m of fine-grained metalliferous sediments have been accumulating for the past 23 000 years (Anschutz, 1995). Unlike those in modern hydrothermal systems at mid-ocean ridges, where most of the metals are expelled to the open ocean in buoyant hydrothermal plumes, metals in the Atlantis II Deep are trapped and precipitated beneath a 200 -m-thick brine layer. These sediments show extremely high concentrations of zinc, copper, silver, and gold (90 Mt of dry salt-free sediment at Zn> 2 %, Cu> 0. 5 %, Ag> 39 g/t., Au> 0. 5 g/t.). While the mode of metal deposition found in the Atlantis II Deep is not known from anywhere else on the seafloor today, it has yet been widely suggested as an analog for many ancient sediment-hosted ore deposits (Laurila et al. 2015). From 1975 to 1981 the German company PREUSSAG was contracted by the Saudi-Sudanese Commission for the Exploitation of the Red Sea Resources to explore the Atlantis II Deep. The project was aimed at assessing the overall technical viability of recovering and processing metalliferous muds on board of a mining vessel. The program encompassed several sampling cruises, a pre-pilot mining test (PPMT), environmental surveys, a study of pre-mining environmental conditions, as well as an economical evaluation. However, despite a highly successful PPMT, economic interest in the project waned due to declining commodity prices in the early 1980 s. A substantial data set was derived from this campaign, including several kilometers of well preserved sediment cores and > 20 000 pages of analog information. Utilizing this information, several GIS-based data mining efforts were carried out in recent years, driven by renewed interest in developing this unique resource. Our presentation will discuss results from these efforts and focus on the technical, economic and environmental boundary conditions of ocean mining of metalliferous sediments. Recently acquired geophysical data in the central Red Sea provide an unprecedented level of ground truth to historic data on Atlantis II...|$|R
