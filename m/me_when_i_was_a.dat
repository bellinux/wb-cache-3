500|$|The year 1968 {{marked the}} start of what Dylan himself later termed his [...] "amnesia", {{referring}} {{to a form of}} writer's block he experienced post-John Wesley Harding (1967), when painting had replaced songwriting as his preferred creative outlet. Well known for his unsophisticated musical approach, particularly in comparison to Harrison's broader [...] "harmonic palette", author Simon Leng suggests, Dylan was now eager to learn some more-advanced chords. Harrison began demonstrating various major seventh, diminished and augmented chord shapes – [...] "all these funny chords people showed <b>me</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> kid", as he later put it. While playing a G major 7 chord and taking the shape up the guitar neck to B major 7, Harrison realised, [...] "Ah, this sounds like a tune here..." [...] Keen to break down the barriers that Dylan had imposed, Harrison came up with the song's opening lines: ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{chief of}} the Bureau of Personnel, Holloway {{summarized}} his philosophy {{to a group of}} young naval officers: [...] "You men probably do not think of it in this way, but I do. To be commissioned in the Navy, you had to be appointed by the President with the approval of Congress. This is the procedure and requirement for the seating of a Supreme Court judge or an ambassador. This is why a naval officer must have his chin out at all times." [...] Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., a lieutenant commander in BuPers from 1953–1955, remembered Holloway as [...] "the superior who most impressed <b>me</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> young officer." ...|$|E
2500|$|Carl Frederick Buechner, {{the eldest}} son of Katherine Kuhn and Carl Frederick Buechner Sr., was born on July 11, 1926 in New York City. During Buechner's early {{childhood}} the family moved frequently, as Buechner's father searched for work. In The Sacred Journey Buechner recalls: [...] "Virtually every year of my life until I was fourteen, I lived in a different place, had different people {{to take care of}} me, went to a different school. The only house that remained constant was the one where my maternal grandparents lived in a suburb of Pittsburgh called East Liberty...Apart from that one house on Woodland Road, home was not a place to <b>me</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> child. It was people." [...] This changed in 1936, when Buechner's father committed suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning, a result of his conviction that he had been a failure. Immediately afterwards, the family moved to Bermuda, where they remained until World War II forced the evacuation of Americans from the island. [...] In Bermuda, Buechner experienced [...] "the blessed relief of coming out of the dark and unmentionable sadness of my father's life and death into fragrance and greenness and light." ...|$|E
