5|$|Another {{strike in}} Szczecin broke out on 22 January 1971. In a risky move, Gierek went to Szczecin on 24 January and to Gdańsk the next day. He met the workers personally, apologizing for the <b>mistakes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past {{and saying that}} as a former worker himself he {{understood}} their plight and would now govern Poland for the people. Workers striking in Szczecin formulated demands {{in the area of}} freely elected worker councils and union representatives. Gierek agreed, but the authorities soon marginalized and eliminated the worker leaders from the legally existing structures and their places of employment. The February 1971 Łódź strikes followed and concentrated on economic demands. Afterwards prices were lowered, wage increases were announced, and sweeping economic and political changes were promised.|$|E
5|$|The DPP {{argued that}} it was never the {{intention}} of The Chaser to breach security and that they were allowed into the restricted area only because of the <b>mistakes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> police. The laws enacted for the summit meant that entry into the restricted zone needed justification, which could include police permission. The DPP stated that by waving The Chaser through, they had granted permission to be in the restricted zone. A further defence was available: all members charged, except Morrow, could argue that they were present for work-related purposes, and part of their employment was to be with Morrow, who was directing the stunt.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to Australia, Graham was subsequently appointed Chief of Staff, Northern Command in December 1967. By 1969 {{a large percentage}} of Australian casualties in Vietnam were being caused by mines, including significant quantities of M16 anti-personnel devices removed by the Viet Cong from the barrier minefield at Dat Do. Total Australian casualties from such mines were later estimated as 55 killed and 250 wounded, a figure which constituted approximately 11 percent of those killed during the war. These losses increasingly became a political issue as support for the war in Australia waned, and the efficacy of the decision was later criticised, both within the military and in the media. As the controversy surrounding the minefield grew, in February 1969 Graham was promoted to major general and appointed Deputy Chief of the General Staff (DCGS) and Fifth Military Member of the Military Board, positions he held until 1972. Meanwhile, after visiting Phuoc Tuy Province respected journalist Denis Warner concluded that although the original concept in laying the minefield had been sound, it was ultimately one of the greatest Australian <b>mistakes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war. By August 1969 work had begun to remove the minefield.|$|E

25|$|It must be mentioned, {{that during}} the strikes, the workers did not repeat <b>mistakes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Poznań 1956 protests and the 1970 events in Pomerania and avoided going out on the streets, instead staying in their factories.

25|$|Egoism {{springs from}} a blind instinct; individualism from wrong-headed {{thinking}} {{rather than from}} depraved feelings.

In the longer term it attacks and destroys all the others and will finally merge with egoism.|$|E

25|$|Russians under Field Marshal Joseph Vladimirovich Gourko {{succeeded in}} {{capturing}} the passes at the Stara Planina mountain, which were crucial for maneuvering. Next, both sides fought {{a series of}} battles for Shipka Pass. Gourko made several attacks on the Pass and eventually secured it. Ottoman troops spent much effort to recapture this important route, {{to use it to}} reinforce Osman Pasha in Pleven, but failed. Eventually Gourko led a final offensive that crushed the Ottomans around Shipka Pass. The Ottoman offensive against Shipka Pass {{is considered one of the}} major <b>mistakes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, as other passes were virtually unguarded. At this time a huge number of Ottoman troops stayed fortified along the Black Sea coast and engaged in very few operations.|$|E
25|$|After Wei Zheng's {{death in}} 643, the emperor commented {{that he was}} a mirror to show the <b>mistakes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court, and built an {{elaborate}} tomb for him near his own imperial tomb and betrothed one of his daughters, Princess Hengshan, to Wei Shuyu (魏叔玉), Wei Zheng's son. Subsequently, as a result of false accusations made by others in the court, the stone monument that Emperor Taizong had built for Wei Zheng was destroyed, and Emperor Taizong cancelled the planned marriage between Princess Hengshan and Wei Shuyu. However, after the failure of the campaign against Goguryeo in 646, Emperor Taizong, believing that Wei Zheng would have stopped him from going on the campaign had he lived longer, restored the stone monument. Wei Zheng's effect and influence has been examined by many historians long after his death. Wei Zheng is also revered as a minor god of doorways in parts of Taiwan.|$|E

After a very bad game Anorthosis Famagusta defeated 2-0 at home of gagra, after some <b>mistakes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> goalkeeper Matúš Kozáčik especially at the first goal. In the third qualifying round Anorthosis encountered FK Rabotnički Skopje.

The Skopje Club scored in their first chance the first goal of the match and after 10 minutes scored a second goal after a huge mistake by Dimitar Ivankov.

25|$|Görgey did not led {{his troops}} in the battle, he let the commanders of his army corps to work {{together}} freely, without being conducted by his orders. And despite of that, this battle demonstrated that the Hungarian army can fight in a perfectly coordinated way, without committing the <b>mistakes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous battles when different officers showed different levels of taking decisions of their own, when the unexpected situation requires it, like for example in the Battle of Isaszeg. In this battle Klapka, Damjanich, and Gáspár, three generals with very different temperaments (Damjanich being very impulsive, taking decisions in the battle in a moment and fulfilling them, without thinking the risk, Klapka, an old fashioned Habsburg-type general, who put a big importance on {{the safety of his}} troops, as well like Gáspár, who was sometimes obeying to the orders taken before from his superiors, even if {{the situation on the ground}} urged him to move differently for the sake of the battle) showed a perfect coordination and the capability of taking correct decisions when the situation required, which assured the success for the Hungarian army. The cavalry also did his best in the pursuing of the fleeing enemy at the end of the battle. This is why the Battle of Nagysalló is considered one of the best executed battles of the Hungarian Independence war.|$|E
