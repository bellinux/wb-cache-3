Ivan VI was assassinated during an attempt to free him as part of a failed coup against Catherine: Catherine, like Empress Elizabeth before her, had given strict instructions that he was to be killed in the event of any such attempt. Ivan was thought to be insane because of his years of solitary confinement, so <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> poor emperor, even as a figurehead.|$|E

[...] At 27-years-of-age, Gebhard had apparently abjured the matrimonial {{life in his}} acceptance of the church career often reserved {{for a second or}} third son of noble families. If he had converted to Lutheranism and resigned from his electoral and episcopal responsibilities, the marriage <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> ripple in social circles, but his refusal to give up his electoral and episcopal responsibilities, his declaration of the electorate as henceforth a dynastic property, however, made his {{marriage of}} utmost political importance. Furthermore, his conversion to Calvinism was heresy, because Calvinism was not one of the two legal professions of faith accepted by the Peace of Augsburg in 1556.|$|E
500|$|... "The {{consensus}} among the music press was that Mariah's insistence on {{including the new}} material {{made all the difference}} in increasing sales figures more than expected. Including some new with the old in a greatest-hits package had been tried from time to time by other artists with varying degrees of success, but with the triumph of #1's, it would become a regular element in nearly all future greatest-hits albums. As such packages go, #1's was a solid retrospective of Mariah's chart hits, but because these songs were oversaturating the radio, including a favorite nonhit album track or two <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> nice change.

[...] Nick Butler from Sputnikmusic positively received the song and [...] "Dynamite" [...] saying [...] "Christina the pop singer is dead, long live Electro Christina". Nick Levine from Digital Spy called the song a [...] "welcome change" [...] from Aguilera's 2006 Back to Basics album, but stated that the song {{is not one of}} Aguilera's best singles. Fraser McAlpine from BBC wrote a mixed review for the song, recognizing Aguilera's maturity in the lyrics. However, he confessed that this could easily be a song by Pink, who <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> better job of making it her own. Allmusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that the singer was instantly overshadowed by fellow singer Britney Spears, but [...] "Keeps Gettin' Better" [...] proves that no other teen pop singer of her era has a better track than Aguilera, concluding that if the new songs are any indication, the title of the hits compilation [...] is no lie either.|$|E

500|$|In his album {{review for}} Rolling Stone, Stephen Holden wrote of Harrison having [...] "inherited the most {{precious}} Beatle legacy – the spiritual aura that the group accumulated" [...] and suggested that he had [...] "maintained its inviolability with remarkable grace". Holden described [...] "Living in the Material World" [...] as [...] "an incantatory, polyrhythmic rocker with a falsetto-on-sitar refrain" [...] and viewed the music as [...] "some {{of the most complex}} on the album". Billboard magazine listed the song first among the [...] "best cuts" [...] on a collection whose themes included [...] "the Beatles and their mish-mash" [...] and a [...] "spiritual undercoat". In Melody Maker, Michael Watts described [...] "Living in the Material World" [...] as [...] "brilliant" [...] and suggested that it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> superior lead single to [...] "Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)". In his 1981 book The Beatles Apart, Bob Woffinden wrote admiringly of Harrison [...] "grappling with the problem" [...] of [...] "striving for spiritual goals when you're a young and famous multi-millionaire". Woffinden dismissed the title track as a [...] "flop", however, citing Harrison's failed attempts [...] "to elide the syllables of 'material'" [...] with the melody.|$|E
500|$|In a less {{enthusiastic}} review, The Independent found West's [...] "immersion {{in personal}} misery" [...] uncomfortable and {{commented that the}} [...] "stylistic tropes quickly become irritating". AllMusic editor Andy Kellman stated [...] "no matter its commendable fearlessness, the album is a listless, bleary trudge along West's permafrost". Charles Aaron from Spin criticized the songs' musical structures, calling the album [...] "a long processional that starts and restarts and never reaches the ceremony". Slant Magazines Wilson McBee panned West's singing, while Jon Caramanica from The New York Times singled it out as the [...] "weakness for which this album will ultimately be remembered, some solid songs notwithstanding." [...] Caramanica wrote that, [...] "at best, it is a rough sketch for a great album, with ideas he would have typically rendered with complexity, here distilled to a few words, a few synthesizer notes, a lean drumbeat. At worst, it’s clumsy and underfed, a reminder that all of that ornamentation served a purpose". Chicago Sun-Times writer Jim DeRogatis stated, [...] "If West had interspersed the more mechanical tracks with some that were the exact opposite—say, simple piano interludes provided by his old collaborators John Legend or Jon Brion—he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> masterpiece.

500|$|In 1970, a low-budget crime drama shot in 16mm by first-time American {{director}} Barbara Loden won {{the international}} critics' prize at the Venice Film Festival. Wanda {{is both a}} seminal event in the independent film movement and a classic B picture. The crime-based plot and often seedy settings would have suited a straightforward exploitation film or an old-school B noir. The $115,000 production, for which Loden spent six years raising money, was praised by Vincent Canby for [...] "the absolute accuracy of its effects, the decency of its point of view and... purity of technique." [...] Like Romero and Van Peebles, other filmmakers of the era made pictures that combined the gut-level entertainment of exploitation with biting social commentary. The first three features directed by Larry Cohen, Bone (1972), Black Caesar (1973), and Hell Up in Harlem (1973), were all nominally blaxploitation movies, but Cohen used them as vehicles for a satirical examination of race relations and the wages of dog-eat-dog capitalism. The gory horror film Deathdream (1974), directed by Bob Clark, is also an agonized protest {{of the war in}} Vietnam. Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg made serious-minded low-budget horror films whose implications are not so much ideological as psychological and existential: Shivers (1975), Rabid (1977), The Brood (1979). An Easy Rider with conceptual rigor, the movie that most clearly presaged the way in which exploitation content and artistic treatment would be combined in modestly budgeted films of later years was United Artists' biker-themed Electra Glide in Blue (1973), directed by James William Guercio. The New York Times reviewer thought little of it: [...] "Under different intentions, it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> decent grade-C Roger Corman bike movie—though Corman has generally used more interesting directors than Guercio." ...|$|E

2500|$|After a {{close reading}} of the Thesmophoriazousae, the {{historian}} Jane McIntosh Snyder observed that Agathon's costume was almost identical {{to that of the}} famous lyric poet Anacreon, as he is portrayed in early 5th-century vase-paintings. [...] Snyder theorizes that Agathon <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> deliberate effort to mimic the sumptuous attire of his famous fellow-poet, although by Agathon's time, such clothing, especially the κεκρύφαλος (kekryphalos, an elaborate covering for the hair) had long fallen out of fashion for men. [...] According to this interpretation, Agathon is mocked in the Thesmophoriazousae not only for his notorious effeminacy, but also for the pretentiousness of his dress: [...] "he seems to think of himself, in all his elegant finery, as a rival to the old Ionian poets, perhaps even to Anacreon himself." ...|$|E

2500|$|At the time, Tanx {{received}} favourable {{reviews in}} both the NME and Record Mirror.

Paul Gambaccini wrote [...] "This one album <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> good EP, since there are four worthwhile tracks, but the remaining nine are flights of Bolan's fantasies that might be interesting to his numerous devotees but less so to more casual listeners", calling it [...] "a sad indication that Bolan really hasn't progressed and I can't see many people being truly pleased with it.

Australia missed Ernie Toshack due to injury, and this <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> difference, since Toshack exploited the rain-affected pitch in the first match and could have done so this time around, had he played.

Zevon had been a frequent guest and occasional substitute bandleader on Letterman's television shows since Late Night was first broadcast in 1982. He noted, [...] "I <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> tactical error in not going to a physician for 20 years."

[...] He also thanked Letterman for his years of support, calling him [...] "the best friend my music's ever had." [...] For his final song of the evening, and his final public performance, Zevon performed [...] "Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner" [...] at Letterman's request. In the green room after the show, Zevon presented Letterman with the guitar that he always used on the show, with a single request: [...] "Here, I {{want you to have}} this, take good care of it." [...] The day after Zevon's death, Letterman paid tribute to him by replaying his performance of [...] "Mutineer" [...] from his last appearance.

2500|$|Bridgeman became First Sea Lord in November 1911, and {{allegedly}} [...] "got the job by default. [...] From a thin list, Bridgeman had one unusual {{quality in}} the pre-1914 navy: a willingness to delegate". By October 1912 he had clashed with First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill on technical issues as well as matters relating to a perceived overriding of naval traditions. [...] Churchill's actions were denigrating the authority of senior officers and harming {{the efficiency of the}} service, thought Bridgeman who planned to take his case to Prime Minister H. H. Asquith and King George V. Churchill acted on reports of personal correspondence from Bridgeman to other officers concerning his attacks of appendicitis and bronchitis, and advised Bridgeman on 2 December 1912 that his resignation would be accepted. [...] He was replaced that month. It was subsequently acknowledged, in response to questions in Parliament, that the initiative for resignation on grounds of health emanated from Churchill rather than from Bridgeman himself. In the opinion of one historian: [...] "The combination of frequent change and weak appointees (Wilson, Bridgeman and Battenberg) ensured that the professional leadership of the Royal Navy lost its direction in the four years preceding the war." [...] However, others have taken a more nuanced view of these men. Arthur Marder wrote that while Bridgeman and Battenberg [...] "were not especially forceful and allowed Churchill a good deal of rope", Bridgeman [...] "did possess sound judgement and he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> moderately successful First Sea Lord had he served under anybody but Churchill." [...] Indeed, it was Bridgeman's efforts to blockade some of Churchill's more controversial schemes that led to his dismissal, as he himself recognized in a letter to Francis Hopwood: [...] "I was forced out without warning, but it was not because I was too weak, but because I was too strong!" ...|$|E
