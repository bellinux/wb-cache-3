40|$|A <b>multicoloring</b> of a {{weighted}} graph G is an assignment of sets of colors to the vertices of G so that two adjacent vertices receive two disjoint sets of colors. A <b>multicoloring</b> problem on G {{is to find}} a <b>multicoloring</b> of G. In particular, we are interested in a minimum <b>multicoloring</b> that uses the least total number of colors. The main focus of this work is to obtain upper bounds on the weighted chromatic number of some classes of graphs in terms of the weighted clique number. We first propose an 11 / 6 -approximation algorithm for <b>multicoloring</b> any weighted planar graph. We then study the <b>multicoloring</b> problem on powers of square and triangular meshes. Among other results, we show that the infinite triangular mesh is an induced subgraph of the fourth power of the infinite square mesh and we present 2 -approximation algorithms for <b>multicoloring</b> a power square mesh and the second power of a triangular mesh, 3 -approximation algorithms for <b>multicoloring</b> powers of semi-toroidal meshes and of triangular meshes and 4 -approximation algorithm for <b>multicoloring</b> the power of a toroidal mesh.

25|$|Senefelder had experimented {{during the}} early 19th century with <b>multicolor</b> lithography; in his 1819 book, he {{predicted}} that the process would eventually be perfected and used to reproduce paintings. Multi-color printing was introduced by a new process developed by Godefroy Engelmann (France) in 1837 known as chromolithography. A separate stone was used for each color, and a print went through the press separately for each stone. The main challenge {{was to keep the}} images aligned (in register). This method lent itself to images consisting of large areas of flat color, and resulted in the characteristic poster designs of this period.|$|E
25|$|<b>Multicolor</b> FISH and {{the older}} {{spectral}} karyotyping are molecular cytogenetic techniques used to simultaneously visualize all the pairs of chromosomes in an organism in different colors. Fluorescently labeled probes for each chromosome are made by labeling chromosome-specific DNA with different fluorophores. Because there are {{a limited number of}} spectrally distinct fluorophores, a combinatorial labeling method is used to generate many different colors. Fluorophore combinations are captured and analyzed by a fluorescence microscope using up to 7 narrow-banded fluorescence filters or, in the case of spectral karyotyping, by using an interferometer attached to a fluorescence microscope. In the case of an mFISH image, every combination of fluorochromes from the resulting original images is replaced by a pseudo color in a dedicated image analysis software. Thus, chromosomes or chromosome sections can be visualized and identified, allowing for the analysis of chromosomal rearrangements.|$|E
25|$|Scholars {{agree that}} the group {{identified}} as Muisca migrated to the Altiplano Cundiboyacense in the Formative stage (between 5500 and 1000 BCE), as shown by evidence found at Aguazuque and Soacha. Like the other formative-stage cultures of America, the Muiscas were transitioning between being hunter-gatherers and becoming sedentary farmers. Around 1500 BCE, groups of agrarians with ceramic traditions came to the region from the lowlands. They had permanent housing and stationary camps, and worked the salty water to extract salt. In Zipacón {{there is evidence of}} agriculture and ceramics. The oldest settlement of the highlands dates to 1270 BCE. Between 500 BCE and 800 BCE, a second wave of migrants came to the highlands. Their presence is identified by <b>multicolor</b> ceramics, housing, and farms. These groups were still in residence upon the arrival of the Spanish conquerors. They left abundant traces of their occupation that have been studied since the 16th century, and allow scientists to reconstruct their way of life. It is possible that the Muisca integrated with more ancient inhabitants, but the Muisca were the ones who molded the cultural profile and the social and political organization. Their language, a dialect of Chibcha, was very similar to those peoples of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (Kogui, Ijka, Wiwa, and Kankuamo) and the Sierra Nevada del Cocuy (U'wa).|$|E

500|$|The Ramsey number R(k,l) is the {{smallest}} number r such that every graph with at least r vertices contains either a k-vertex clique or an l-vertex independent set. Ramsey numbers require enormous effort to compute; when max(k,l)≥3 only finitely {{many of them are}} known precisely, and an exact computation of R(6,6) is believed to be out of reach. In 1953, the calculation of R(3,3) was given as a question in the Putnam Competition; in 1955, motivated by this problem, Gleason and his co-author Robert E. Greenwood made significant progress in the computation of Ramsey numbers with their proof that R(3,4)=9, R(3,5)=14, and R(4,4)=18. Since then, only five more of these values have been found. In the same 1955 paper, Greenwood and Gleason also computed the <b>multicolor</b> Ramsey number R(3,3,3): {{the smallest}} number r such that, if a complete graph on r vertices has its edges colored with three colors, then it necessarily contains a monochromatic triangle. As they showed, R(3,3,3)=17; this remains the only nontrivial <b>multicolor</b> Ramsey number whose exact value is known. As part of their proof, they used an algebraic construction to show that a 16-vertex complete graph can be decomposed into three disjoint copies of a triangle-free 5-regular graph with 16 vertices and 40 edges ...|$|E

The <b>multicolor</b> effects of intricate lines and flame-like streaks on the petals were vivid and spectacular and made the bulbs that produced these even more exotic-looking plants highly sought-after.

Also, the indusium of P.merulinus is more delicate and shorter than that of P.indusiatus, and is thus less likely to collapse under its own weight.
