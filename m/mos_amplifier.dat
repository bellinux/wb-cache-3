40|$|The {{settling}} {{behavior and}} power consumption of dynamic opamps are considered. The dynamic opamp is {{compared with a}} class A opamp for different clock frequencies. A single pole model in a closed loop configuration is used to estimate slewing and settling behavior. SPICE simulation results agree with theoretical predictions. It is shown that for the same power consumption dynamic opamps settle much faster than class A opamps. Dynamic opamps are particularly well suited for ultra low power switched-capacitor designs. 1 Introduction Copeland and Rabaey first suggested a dynamic <b>MOS</b> <b>amplifier</b> in an inverter form [1]. Later a family of dynamic amplifiers were proposed and their performance was measured by Hosticka [2, 3]. Also, a low power SC bandpass filter was described using dynamic opamps [4].

40|$|A {{new concept}} for {{uncooled}} infrared (IR) imaging with a double-cantilever microbolometer structure has been proposed. The approach {{has the potential}} of reaching a noise equivalent temperature difference (NETD) in the millikelvin range. The proposed microbolometer architecture comprises a thermally sensitive bimaterial element that controls the position of two capacitor plates coupled to the input of a low noise <b>MOS</b> <b>amplifier.</b> The top and the bottom plates of the sensing capacitor are composed of two overlapped free-standing bimaterial cantilever beams. The bimaterial element with maximum difference in thermal expansion coefficients will convert heat into mechanical movement. The orientation of the bimaterials for the top and the bottom cantilever beams is such that the metal layer on the bottom cantilever beam faces the metal layer on the top cantilever beam. IR irradiation will result in a deflection of the double-cantilever beams in opposite directions, enabling a large change in the sensing capacitor. Residual stress and curvature in each layer can be modified by an ion implantation technique. The advantages of the pixel design include extremely high sensitivity and low noise. In addition, the absorption of incident infrared irradiation can be enhanced dramatically by the aid of a resonant cavity configuration between the top and bottom plates. The design and manufacture of double-cantilever microbolometers are very flexible since the resonant cavity and the sensing capacitor gap are realized using two separate sacrificial layers. The effects of sensing capacitor gap distance, leg length, and bimaterial thickness on the microbolometer performance have also been investigated...|$|E

Resistors are used in place of the other three MOS transistors. The FeFET model used in the analysis has been previously reported and was based on experimental device data. Because of the FeFET hysteresis, the FeFET differential amplifier has four different operating modes depending on whether the FeFETs are positively or negatively polarized. The FeFET differential amplifier operation in the different modes was analyzed by calculating the amplifier voltage transfer and gain characteristics shown in figures 2 through 5.

40|$|Integrated {{circuits}} {{are very}} popular for understandable reasons. A circuit implemented within an IC is more cost effective and reliable. A {{vast majority of}} ICs are created using silicon because it is cheap and the technology is mature. Unfortunately, communications power amplifiers have been scarce, due to the electrical advantages provided by III-V semiconductors. In order to reach similar power levels, power amplifiers implemented on silicon require larger transistors. It is common practice to create such transistors using multiple smaller transistors connected in parallel. As the frequency of operation increases, the connections between the smaller transistors affect the overall system???s behavior.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{radiation}} effects to electronics circuits has been ongoing {{almost as long}} as there have been satellites and spacecraft in space. The response to radiation over the planned life of the space system is of great concern to system designers. Operational amplifiers {{are one of the most}} basic elements in all electronic systems. This research examines radiation effects of part of a Metal Oxide Semiconductor (<b>MOS)</b> operational <b>amplifier</b> and is applicable to Complimentary MOS (CMOS) technology as well. More specifically, it is pertinent to MOS capacitors used to internally compensate op amps. First, a review of semiconductor theory is presented followed by a discussion of damage mechanisms to MOS capacitors and a brief look at operational <b>amplifier</b> fundamentals. <b>MOS</b> capacitors, constructed by previous research efforts using the MOSIS technique, were selected as the internally compensating elements for simple low pass filters. Using the Naval Postgraduate School linear accelerator, these capacitors were irradiated with pulsed electrons possessing energies of up to 26 MeV for varying times. In-situ measurements were taken to immediately determine the capacitance value via the measured filter break frequency as a function of fluence. Separate irradiation runs were performed on three MOSIS capacitors and were terminated upon filter failure. This research concludes with a hypothesis of the filter fallure mechanism and suggested areas for expansion of continuing research efforts.

5000|$|Image sensor {{elements}} with in-pixel amplifiers were described by Noble in 1968, by Chamberlain in 1969, and by Weimer et al. in 1969, {{at a time}} when passive-pixel sensors - that is, pixel sensors without their own amplifiers or active noise cancelling circuitry - were being investigated as a solid-state alternative to vacuum-tube imaging devices. The MOS passive-pixel sensor used just a simple switch in the pixel to read out the photodiode integrated charge. Pixels were arrayed in a two-dimensional structure, with an access enable wire shared by pixels in the same row, and output wire shared by column. At the end of each column was an amplifier. Passive-pixel sensors suffered from many limitations, such as high noise, slow readout, and lack of scalability. The addition of an amplifier to each pixel addressed these problems, and resulted {{in the creation of the}} active-pixel sensor. Noble in 1968 and Chamberlain in 1969 created sensor arrays with active <b>MOS</b> readout <b>amplifiers</b> per pixel, in essentially the modern three-transistor configuration. The CCD was invented in October 1969 at Bell Labs. Because the MOS process was so variable and MOS transistors had characteristics that changed over time (Vth instability), the CCD's charge-domain operation was more manufacturable and quickly eclipsed MOS passive and active pixel sensors. A low-resolution [...] "mostly digital" [...] N-channel MOSFET imager with intra-pixel amplification, for an optical mouse application, was demonstrated in 1981.|$|R
40|$|Today's {{world of}} {{electronics}} {{becomes more and}} more digital and therefore CMOS becomes the dominant technology. A CMOS process compared to a bipolar process offers several advantages, mainly a low power consumption which is important for portable systems powered by batteries or for large systems. Another point is the smaller device geometries, which increase the number of gates that can be packed on a single chip. Parallel to the increasing digital domain the analog field persists, because the origin of physical phenomenons and their perception is analog. Electronic sensors perceive these analog events and deliver a corresponding output signal. If this analog signal is not suitable for digital processing some analog preconditioning must be done [YEN 82]. Combining both types of signal processing on the same chip to obtain the best possible performances is therefore desirable [MID 84]. CMOS technology has led to a wide use of voltages and charge transfers for signal processing. As the feature sizes shrink a lower supply voltage is imposed, which reduces the dynamic voltage range of the circuits. Because process parameters are chosen to optimize digital performances, the analog functional blocks have to adapt themselves to the restricted voltage range. Current mode circuits offer a solution to these problems as they require only a baseline digital process and avoid many of the anticipated low voltage problems by operating in the current domain [HUG 89]. Due to the non-linear current-voltage relationship the dynamic range of current-mode signals is larger than that of voltage-mode signals. Therefore the current mode approach can provide attractive and elegant solutions for many circuit and system problems [TOU 90]. A ubiquitous elementary building block in most analog integrated circuits is the current mirror which is able to multiply and duplicate an imposed input current, that contains the information (bias or signal). The reproduced output current of is then available for any subsequent processing. Unfortunately, due to random process variations, transistor parameters are affected by a certain variation of the transconductance parameter and of the threshold voltage [SHY 84], [LAK 86]. Hence, the output currents of transistors which have been designed identically are different. These random variations, the so-called devices mismatch, are a major limitation for most accurate and precise current mode circuit applications. Another main limitation of CMOS circuits is the 1 /f flicker noise of the MOS transistors. The standard technique to reduce this 1 /f noise and the error due to mismatch is to increase the transistor area and to overwhelm the threshold mismatch with a high gate voltage overhead, which simultaneously increases the saturation voltage of the devices. The performance of a mirror with low saturation voltage can be improved by using lateral bipolar transistors [VIT 83]. The resulting current error can be lower than 1 %, but the major handicap is that only one type of mirror can be built (source or sink depending on the technology used). Special circuit techniques allow us to reduce the inherent noise and offset in <b>MOS</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> like the chopper technique [HSI 81], [ENZ 89], and the auto-zero technique [YEN 82], [DEG 85]. The auto-zero technique is also used to ensure adequate biasing of CMOS inverters or analog-to-digital converters [CAN 82]. Dynamic element matching [VdP 76] is based on the chopper technique and shifts the error components to higher frequencies. The drawback of this technique is the high residual output ripple, which for most applications must be filtered out by using external components. Furthermore multiple mirrors are difficult to implement. Dynamic analog techniques [VIT 85. 1] exploit the absence of gate current to temporarily store some analog information on the gate capacitance of the MOS device. A reported application of this analog storage capability is the dynamic comparator [YEE 78] which sequentially uses the same transistor as the two devices of a differential pair. With this auto-zero technique the very notion of mismatch disappears. The achievable precision is moved to new limits and depends on the capability of accurately storage the signal, mainly limited by charge injection from the MOS transistors used as switches. Although the idea of current sampling was formulated over ten years ago [OGU 78], the first accurate implementation dates from 1988, because the circuit theory and process technology did not allow researchers to obtain the expected results. In the "Electronics Letters" issue of December 1988 [DAU 88] published the idea and some simulated results, which induced a series of publications during the year of 1989. Several research laboratories have focused on the subject during the last few years, with the reported results of [GRO 89] concerning D/A converters, [NAI 89. 2] for A/D converters, [HUG 89] for current mode circuits and filters, and ourselves [VIT 88], [WEG 89. 1] for dynamic current mirrors. The primary objective being pursued in this dissertation is to investigate the different possibilities, to design and to analyze the performances and limitations of a new type of current mirror, a so-called dynamic mirror or current copier. The goal is to build highly accurate current mirrors in the simplest and most compact way. The best strategy for a given problem can be chosen only if all parameters influencing the circuit performances are known. The outline of this thesis is the following: Chapter 2 presents the principle of memorization of a current copier. The main limitations which influence the achievable accuracy are deduced and cell structures which reduce these effects derived. In Chapter 3 the principle and the different configurations of dynamic current mirrors are extensively described, and their advantages and disadvantages discussed and compared. Possibilities of realizing multiple, multiplying and dividing current mirrors are highlighted. Chapter 4 provides a deeper look at the different parameters, which limit the accuracy of a dynamic current mirror, namely drain voltage variations, leakage currents, noise and charge injection. The sampling of white noise and 1 /f noise is analyzed and their contribution calculated. The influence of charge injection is evaluated and the interfering parameters shown. The transient behavior is considered in Chapter 5, where the output spikes and the trade-off between speed and accuracy are highlighted. Chapter 6 emphasizes layout considerations and the practical implementation of a dynamic current mirror. Chapter 7 summarizes the experimental results obtained with such mirrors. Chapter 8 deals with the different possible applications, focusing on a continuous time filter. The principle of D/A & A/D converters and switched current filters are outlined, and the extension to other functional blocs is suggested. Finally Chapter 9 provides summarizing remarks and conclusions...|$|R
