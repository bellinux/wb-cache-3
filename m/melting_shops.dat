50|$|Steel {{manufacture}} at {{the site}} ended in 1978; the site had manufactured steel with an open hearth furnace, the type of <b>melting</b> <b>shops</b> that British Steel wanted to discontinue. In the mid-1970s, it employed around 3,500. The plate mill at Clydebridge plate works rolled its last plate on 12 November 1982. As of 2016 it is currently owned by Liberty House Group and employs 45 workers in its heat treatment and quenching facilities. The M74 motorway now runs through the works site adjacent to the remaining buildings.|$|E
50|$|After merger the {{adjacent}} Appleby and Frodingham works both produced pig iron, with the Frodingham works specialising in bars and sections, and the Appleby works plates and slabs. In 1937 each site had four blast furnaces each, each with two relatively modern builds, {{with a maximum}} diameter of 17 ft in three; capacities of the four modern furnaces were two at 2,300 tons, one at 2,000 tons and one at 1,650 tons per week. Blast furnace gas was used at both sites to power electrical generators, and further energy recovery from the residual hot gas obtained from water tube boilers heated by the gas, or for heating in the steel works. Both works contained similar <b>melting</b> <b>shops</b> - the Appleby works had five tilting furnaces (open hearth) of 250 or 300 ton capacity. Employment over both sites was 6,500 in 1937. In {{the context of the}} wider United Steel group, rationalisation during the 1930s led the Appleby Frodingham works to be specialised in plates and heavy sections, whilst lighter section, bars, rod and wire were produced at the group's Steel, Peech and Tozer and Samuel Fox works in Yorkshire, with rails and ferroalloys at the Workington site., In 1945 the works was the largest in Britain, with a capacity of 700 million tons pa (5.5% national production), and occupied a 1700 acre site.|$|E

50|$|The Krefeld mill with 100 {{years of}} {{experience}} in stainless steel production, closed its <b>melt</b> <b>shop</b> in December 2012 and re-focused on cold rolling and R&D. The Benrath cold rolling mill was to relocate to Krefeld, to make a range of grades, dimensions and surface finishes. The Dahlerbrück cold rolling mill is located in Sauerland producing precision strip and looks back on a 300-year tradition of iron and steelmaking. The cold rolling mill in Dillenburg specializes on surface finishes for example in architecture, building and construction. The Bochum <b>melt</b> <b>shop</b> is on fast track for closure since October 2012, to close by 2014.|$|R
50|$|In 1992 {{the site}} {{was taken over by}} Avesta Sheffield Ltd, a company formed from the merger of British Steel Stainless Ltd and the Swedish company Avesta AB. Between 1992 and 1996, {{worldwide}} investment in the Stainless Long Products industry reached an intense level and competition from larger steel works put the Panteg <b>Melting</b> <b>Shop</b> under severe pressure. Although the work-force made determined efforts to remain competitive, closure of the <b>melting</b> <b>shop</b> was announced in September 1996. On 12 December 1996, the last furnace of cast steel was made at Panteg, but stainless steel coil processing of over 50,000 tonnes per annum continued.|$|R
50|$|The {{steel making}} plant was changed in 1897 when the Bessemer {{converters}} {{were replaced by}} three open hearth furnaces and the processing plant increased {{with the addition of}} cogging mills, rail mills and specialist plant for the manufacture of steel springs and railway axles. In 1914, following the outbreak of the First World War many iron and steel companies began producing munitions. In this case the work was added to the normal production, which included many component orders for the military. The Ickles site was proving too small to handle the production, and with steel in such demand, the company extended their works towards the Sheffield boundary, to occupy a site between the main Sheffield to Rotherham road and the Great Central Railway line. The new <b>Melting</b> <b>Shop</b> and Rolling Mills were built over the site of the old Roman fort at Templeborough. The Templeborough <b>Melting</b> <b>Shop,</b> when opened, was the largest <b>melting</b> <b>shop</b> of its type in Europe and contained 14 open hearth furnaces where steel scrap was melted down.|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze the correlation of age and working period with hearing threshold value of workers exposed to noise in the unit of production Steel <b>Melting</b> <b>Shop</b> PT.

Samplesin this study are 28 employees, taken by simple random sampling with criteria inklusi willing to be the sample of the research and not experience pain (no history of ear disease and had never experienced head trauma). Variables independent is age, and working period. Variable dependent is a hearing threshold value. Noise measurements in the unit production of Steel <b>Melting</b> <b>Shop</b> PT.

40|$|Occupational {{exposure}} {{studies were}} undertaken at a UK {{electric arc furnace}} (EAF) steelmak-ing plant to investigate the exposure of workers via inhalation to dioxins, polychlorinated bi-phenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) including benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P). Surveys were undertaken in areas including the <b>melting</b> <b>shop,</b> the casting department and a furnace control cabin. The highest concentrations of dioxins and PCBs were found inside the <b>melting</b> <b>shop</b> nearby EAFs, whereas dioxin and PCB concentrations in the casting depart-ment and inside the control cabin were significantly lower. Risk characterization {{was carried out by}} comparing the daily intake of dioxins and PCBs through inhalation with the recommen-ded tolerable daily intake (TDI). Health risk assessments were also carried out by combining exposure data with inhalation cancer potency factors to quantify the cancer risk. For the most exposed category of workers (<b>melting</b> <b>shop</b> workers), the estimated daily intake via inhalation was 0. 35 pgWHO-TEQ kg 21 body weight (bw) in the worst case scenario. Considering that the average UK adult exposure to dioxins from the diet is 1. 8 pg WHO-TEQ kg 21 bw day 21, the results indicated that the estimated daily intake of dioxins via inhalation at the EAF would not result in the recommended range of the TDI (1 – 4 pg WHO-TEQ kg 21 bw day 21) bein...|$|R

50|$|Scrap metal is {{delivered}} to a scrap bay, located {{next to the}} <b>melt</b> <b>shop.</b> Scrap generally comes in two main grades: shred (whitegoods, cars and other objects made of similar light-gauge steel) and heavy melt (large slabs and beams), along with some direct reduced iron (DRI) or pig iron for chemical balance. Some furnaces melt almost 100% DRI.|$|R
40|$|The {{recycling}} options of spent MgO-C refractories from an electrical arc furnace (EAF) have been evaluated. The economic, quality of spent refractories and products made from it, {{the ease of}} implementation of a recycling practice and the interest of steel <b>melt</b> <b>shops</b> were considered. It was decided that the best option of most EAF shops would be to recycle spent MgO-C refractory as a foaming slag conditioner because of their MgO content. Crushed MgO-C spent refractories can be reused directly back into an EAF without complex and costly beneficiation. Even though this practice is simple, {{it is critical to}} know the optimum amount of MgO in the slag to achieve the best foaming quality. A computer model was designed to find the optimum MgO amount. This modeling also helps the <b>melt</b> <b>shop</b> extend refractory service life, increase the energy efficiency, increase productivity, and decrease the amount of slag. Issues related to the refractory recycling will be discussed...|$|R
