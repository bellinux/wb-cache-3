5|$|One of {{the most}} common methods for {{estimating}} the parameters of a distribution from data, the method of <b>maximum</b> <b>likelihood</b> (MLE), can break down in various cases, such as involving certain mixtures of continuous distributions. In these cases the method of maximum spacing estimation may be successful.|$|E
5|$|The maximum spacing {{estimator}} is {{a consistent}} estimator {{in that it}} converges in probability to the true value of the parameter, θ0, as the sample size increases to infinity. The consistency of maximum spacing estimation holds under much more general conditions than for <b>maximum</b> <b>likelihood</b> estimators. In particular, {{in cases where the}} underlying distribution is J-shaped, <b>maximum</b> <b>likelihood</b> will fail where MSE succeeds. An example of a J-shaped density is the Weibull distribution, specifically a shifted Weibull, with a shape parameter less than 1. The density will tend to infinity as x approaches the location parameter rendering estimates of the other parameters inconsistent.|$|E

5|$|There {{are certain}} distributions, {{especially}} those with three or more parameters, whose likelihoods may become infinite along certain paths in the parameter space. Using <b>maximum</b> <b>likelihood</b> to estimate these parameters often breaks down, with one parameter tending to the specific value that causes the likelihood to be infinite, rendering the other parameters inconsistent. The method of maximum spacings, however, being dependent on the difference between points on the cumulative distribution function and not individual likelihood points, does not have this issue, and will return valid results over a much wider array of distributions.|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} classes of method for ancestral reconstruction.

In this paper, we introduce, for semiparametric two-samples {{density ratio}} models, a new {{estimation}} and test method based on estimation of φ-divergences between probability measures, using the so-called dual representation of φ-divergences.

40|$|In this article, we have {{investigated}} a bias in an asymptotic {{expansion of the}} <b>maximum</b> simulated <b>likelihood</b> estimator introduced by Lerman and Manski for the estimation of discrete choice models. This bias occurs due to the nonlinearity of the derivatives of the log likelihood function and the statistically independent simulation errors of the choice probabilities across observations. This bias can be the dominated bias in an asymptotic expansion of the <b>maximum</b> simulated <b>likelihood</b> estimator {{when the number of}} simulated random variables per observationdoes not increase as fast as or faster than the sample size. The properly normalized <b>maximum</b> simulated <b>likelihood</b> estimator has even an asymptotic bias in its limiting distribution if the number of simulated random variables increase only as fast as the square root of the sample size. A bias-adjustment is introduced which can reduce the bias. Some Monte Carlo experiments have demonstrated the usefulness of the bias-adjustment procedure...|$|R
