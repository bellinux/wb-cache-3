2500|$|Solo {{performers}} praised {{his work}} with them. Artur Schnabel called Muck: [...] "a very great master, whose reliability, maturity and selfless dedication are not equaled by any living artist." [...] Paderewski called him [...] "an ideal accompanist". In physical terms, his conducting style required minimal movement, only small gestures {{with the tip of}} his baton. In areas of interpretation {{he was one of the}} first modernists. Though old enough to be part of generation known for taking liberties with the score and indulging in flexible tempos, he was by contrast disciplined and direct, less concerned with placing his personal stamp on a score than on demonstrating fidelity to the score and ceding a certain interpretive anonymity. By contrast with his conducting style, orchestra players found him impatient, explosive, nervous, and impulsive. He showed no casual or relaxed side of himself at concerts, rather [...] "he dominated the orchestra and the audience and the occasion." [...] The Austrian conductor Karl BÃ¶hm said in a 1972 interview: [...] "Karl Muck by chance heard me direct Lohengrin, and he invited me to study all Wagner's scores with him. He was the first and greatest influence on me... Muck told <b>me</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> orchestra should be more prominent, how to handle the Bayreuth acoustics, and so on." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the dashcam audio/video of the {{incident}} Yanez can be heard being questioned by St. Anthony Police Officer Tressa Sunde within minutes of the shooting, and telling her: {{was sitting in the}} car, seat belted. I told him, 'Can I see your license?' And then, {{he told me he had}} a firearm. I told him not to reach for it and (sigh) when he went down to grab, I told him not to reach for it (clears throat) and then he kept it right there, and I told him to take his hands off of it, and then he (sigh) he had his, his grip a lot wider than a wallet .... And I don't know where the gun was, he didn't tell <b>me</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> fucking gun was, and then it was just getting hinky, he gave, he was just staring ahead, and then I was getting fucking nervous, and then I told him, I know I fucking told him to get his fucking hand off his gun.According to the official Minnesota Department of Public Safety's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) transcript of the interview of Yanez and his attorneys Tom Kelly and Robert Fowler, Yanez stated that his justification for the shooting was based on fear for his own life because he believed that Castile's behavior was abusive toward a young girl passenger (Reynolds' daughter) in the car. Yanez said: [...] "I thought, I was gonna die, and I thought if he's, if he has the, the guts and the audacity to smoke marijuana in front of the five-year-old girl and risk her lungs and risk her life by giving her secondhand smoke and the front seat passenger doing the same thing, then what, what care does he give about me?" [...] The victims' previous marijuana use later became a focus of the defense, with a mason jar containing a small amount having been found in the car.|$|E
