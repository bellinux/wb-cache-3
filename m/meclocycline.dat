50|$|<b>Meclocycline</b> (INN) is a {{tetracycline}} antibiotic. It is used topically (i.e. {{for skin}} infections) {{as it is}} totally insoluble in water and may cause liver and kidney damage if given systemically.|$|E
40|$|Background. Bacterial ribosomes {{have been}} {{considered}} the principal targets of tetracyclines. Recently, new clinical data has shown how other biomacromolecules {{are involved in the}} cellular damage of bacteria. Researchers are now reconsidering the pharmacological classification of tetracyclines, not only based on their semisynthetic or synthetic generations but also following the new mechanisms of action that are progressively being discovered. Materials and Methods. The toxicity properties of seven tetracycline derivatives (tetracycline, oxytetracycline, demeclocycline, chlortetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, and <b>meclocycline)</b> were investigated in vitro using a cell line of human keratinocytes. Cells were irradiated in the presence of tetracyclines for different durations and at three different intensities of light. The investigation of protein oxidation was set up using model proteins to quantify the formation of carbonyl groups. Results. After incubation and irradiation with UV light, the viability of keratinocytes was assessed with half the maximal inhibitory concentration for doxycycline, demeclocycline, chlortetracycline, and tetracycline. No phototoxicity was observed for oxytetracycline, <b>meclocycline,</b> and minocycline. Conclusions. This study provides evidence that tetracycline’s derivatives show different photobehaviour according to their chemical properties due to different reactive groups on the same molecular skeleton...|$|E
40|$|Despite longstanding {{efforts to}} develop cytoprotective drugs against ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injuries, there remains no {{effective}} therapeutics to treat hypoxic injury. The failure of traditional strategies at solving this problem suggests the need for novel and unbiased approaches {{that can lead to}} previously unsuspected targets and lead compounds. Towards this end, we report here a unique small molecule screen in the nematode C. elegans for compounds that improve recovery when applied after the hypoxic insult, using a C. elegans strain engineered to have delayed cell non-autonomous death. In a screen of 2000 compounds, six were found to produce significant protection of C. elegans from delayed death. Four of the compounds were tested in an ex vivo mouse heart ischemia/reperfusion model and two, <b>meclocycline</b> and 3 -amino- 1, 2, 4 -triazole, significantly reduced infarction size. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of this novel C. elegans screen to discover hypoxia protective drugs that are also protective in a mammalian model of hypoxic injury...|$|E
40|$|Antibiotic and {{antifungal}} agents used in {{supportive care}} regimens for {{bone marrow transplantation}} recipients contribute to a significant dose-modifying effect of otherwise lethal total body irradiation. To determine whether drugs used in supportive care and other commonly used antibiotics such as tetracycline function as radiation protectors or damage mitigators in vitro, 13 drugs were tested for radiation protection and radiation damage mitigation of 32 D cl 3 hematopoietic progenitor cells in clonagenic survival curves in vitro. Antibiotic/Antifungal agents including cilastatin, amikacin, ceftazidine, vancomycin, tetracycline, doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, methacycline, minocycline, <b>meclocycline,</b> Oxytet racycline and rolitetracycline were added in 1, 10, or 100 micromolar concentrations to murine interleukin- 3 -dependent hematopoietic progenitor cell line 32 D cl 3 cells either before or after irradiation of 0 to 8 Gy. Control irradiated 32 D cl 3 cells showed radiosensitivity comparable to freshly explanted mouse marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells (D 0 1. 1 ± 0. 1 Gy, Ñ 15 ± 0. 4). Positive control GS-nitroxide JP 4 - 039 (known radiation mitigator) treated 32 D cl 3 cells were radioresistant (D 0 1. 2 ± 0. 1, Ñ 5. 8 ± 2. 4 (p= 0. 009)). Of the 13 drugs tested, tetracycline {{was found to be}} a significant radiation mitigator (D 0 0. 9 ± 0. 1, Ñ 13. 9 ± 0. 4 (p= 0. 0027)). Thus, the radiation dose-modifying effect of some antibiotics, but not those currently used in the supportive care (antibiotic/antifungal regimens) for marrow transplant patients, may act as radiation damage mitigators for hematopoietic cells as well as decreasing the growth and inflammatory response to microbial pathogens...|$|E
