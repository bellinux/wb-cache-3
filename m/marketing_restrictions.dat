40|$|Recent {{research}} in international business cycles based upon complete markets {{has found that}} international consumption correlations are lower than predicted by the standard risk-sharing implications of these models. In this paper, I use regression tests to ask whether {{two different types of}} explanations can help explain this result. First, I consider whether non-separabilities between tradeables and non-tradeable leisure or goods can explain the puzzle. Surprisingly, non-separabilities explain {{only a tiny fraction of}} the variation in tradeables consumption across countries. Furthermore, risk-sharing in tradeables is rejected. Second, I examine the effects of capital <b>market</b> <b>restrictions</b> on aggregate consumption risk-sharing by countries. While rejections of risk-sharing are stronger for countries facing more severe capital <b>market</b> <b>restrictions,</b> risk-sharing is still rejected for the unrestricted group of countries. Therefore, risk-sharing does not appear to be resolved by either explanation alone. However, when I allow for both non-separabilities and certain <b>market</b> <b>restrictions,</b> risk-sharing among unrestricted countries is not rejected. This evidence suggests that a combination of these two effects may be necessary to explain consumption risk-sharing across countries. ...|$|R

40|$|Shortage {{of timber}} input for {{processing}} industries {{is the main}} issue facing the Malaysian forest sector. The need to implement policies which will ease the pressure on timber shortage and induce the expansion of forest sector industry, development of rubberwood sector in Malaysia is becoming increasingly urgent. The Malaysian government has announced and implemented three main policies: timber <b>market</b> <b>restriction,</b> encourage utilisation of rubberwood and promotion of lesser-known timber species (LKS). Application of timber <b>market</b> <b>restriction</b> policies has a considerable dispute; firstly because of widespread disagreement over the effect on efficiency of utilisation of timber that lead to timber harvest and deforestation and secondly it will undermine the government effort to promote utilisation of rubberwood and lesser known species. In this thesis, an attempt {{has been made to}} enlarge the available empirical knowledge of such effect through a. multi-sectoral forest - rubberwood sector model simulation. An analytical framework is developed, focusing on three major product of the forest sector; log, sawnWood and plywood, and two major products of rubberwood sector; rubberwood log and sawn rubberwood. The framework is used to developed an empirical model of forest-rubberwood and analysed the effect of <b>market</b> <b>restriction</b> policy on forest harvest behaviour, sawnwood and plywood development, rubberwood sector development and change in forest cover. The production, consumption and export of timber, sawnwood, plywood, rubberwood and sawn rubberwood, and change in forest cover have been examined in relation to a number of market policies: export taxes, export ban and import ban, and other alternative policies; royalty, exchange rate, wood utilisation efficiency and subsidies. A series of simulations was undertaken to describe the effect of these policies. The analysis suggests that export restriction on processed timber product will reduced the timber harvest and improved the forest cover but will hinder or distort the development of rubberwood sector and utilisation of less timber species. Related to the deforestation, the notion of environmental Kuznets curve is also examined. The results does not support the existence of this notion for Malaysia. In addition to sectoral analysis, an extended analysis using species harvest was undertaken, as a new approach to investigate efficiency of utilisation of wood resource and forest cover. The results show that promotion of species utilisation will not be achieved with the implementation of <b>market</b> <b>restriction</b> policy on forest products. Species analysis also indicate that in the absence of full data on the quantity of forest harvest, species harvest data would be a good alternative to estimate the effect of policies on forest cover...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{identify}} British American Tobacco's (BAT) {{reasons for}} targeting the former Soviet Union following its collapse in 1991 {{and the initial}} strategies BAT used to enter the region. Design: Analysis of tobacco industry documents held at the Guildford BAT archive. Results: Desire to expand to new markets was {{based in part on}} the decline in old markets. The large population, proximity to China, scope to expand sales to women and, in Central Asia, a young population with high growth rates made the former Soviet Union particularly attractive. High consumption rates and unfilled demand caused by previous shortages offered potential for rapid returns on investment. A series of steps were taken to penetrate the markets with the initial focus on establishing imports. The documents suggest that BAT encouraged the use of aid money and barter trade to fund imports and directed the smuggling of cigarettes which graduated from an opportunistic strategy to a highly organised operation. In establishing a market presence, promotion of BAT's brands and corporate image were paramount, and used synonymously to promote both the cigarettes and the company. The tobacco industry targeted young people and women. It used the allure of western products to promote its brands and brand stretching and corporate imagery to pre-empt future <b>marketing</b> <b>restrictions.</b> Conclusions: BAT used the chaotic conditions in the immediate post-transition period in the former Soviet Union to exploit legislative loopholes and ensure illegal cigarette imports.

40|$|Taking {{advantage}} of a historical quasi-experiment in Sri Lanka, this paper provides evidence {{on the effects of}} land <b>market</b> <b>restrictions</b> on wages and its spatial pattern. The empirical specification is derived from a general equilibrium model that predicts that the adverse effects of land <b>market</b> <b>restrictions</b> on wages will be less in remote locations. For identification, the study exploits the effects of historical malaria prevalence on the incidence of land restrictions through its effects on"crown land". During the 16 th to early 20 th centuries, areas severely affected by malaria were abandoned by households and the land was taken over by the government. These lands that were later distributed through resettlement programs are subject to sales, rental, and mortgage restrictions. The variations in the amount of crown land resulting from different intensity of historical malaria provide a source of exogenous variations in the incidence of land restrictions in a sub-district. The results show that land restrictions reduce wages substantially, and this effect is smaller in remote locations. A 1 percent increase in land restrictions reduces wages by about 6. 6 percent at the median travel time from an urban center, and the effect becomes effectively zero after 6 hours of travel time.
