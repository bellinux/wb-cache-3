5|$|The T-26 entered active {{service for}} the Red Army (RKKA) in 1932; it was used in many {{conflicts}} of the 1930s as well as during World War II. The T-26 together with the BT was the <b>main</b> <b>tank</b> of the RKKA armoured forces during the interwar period.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} {{developed from the}} prototype T2 tank built by Rock Island Arsenal, which had a Vickers-type leaf spring suspension. The suspension {{was replaced by the}} superior vertical volute system in the T2E1 series of 1935. This was put into production with minor modifications as the M2A1 in 1936, with ten produced. The main pre-war version was the M2A2, with 239 produced, becoming the <b>main</b> <b>tank</b> in the US Army infantry units in the pre-world-war-II period. The Spanish Civil War showed that tanks armed only with machine guns were ineffective. This led to the M2A4 with a 37mm gun as the main armament. A total of 375 were delivered, the last ten as late as April 1942.|$|E
5|$|The <b>main</b> <b>tank</b> of the Soviet tank arm was the T-34, {{on which}} the Red Army {{attempted}} to concentrate production. The tank arm also contained large numbers of the T-70 light tank. For example, the 5th Guards Tank Army roughly contained 270 T-70s and 500 T-34s. In the salient itself the Soviets assembled {{a large number of}} lend-lease tanks. These included U.S.-manufactured M3 Lees and British-built Churchills, Matildas and Valentines. However, the T-34 made up the bulk of the Soviet armour. Without including the deeper reserves organised under the Steppe Front, the Soviets massed about 1,300,000 men, 3,600 tanks, 20,000 artillery pieces and 2,792 aircraft to defend the salient. This amounted to 26 percent of the total manpower of the Red Army, 26 percent of its mortars and artillery, 35 percent of its aircraft and 46 percent of its tanks.|$|E

25|$|Arthur's story resembles {{versions}} of the original Aquaman's. While awaiting transport to Miami, Florida, {{a young man named}} Arthur Joseph Curry is washed out to sea when a storm ruptures the tank he is in. This Arthur Curry, much like the Golden Age Aquaman, is the son of oceanobiologist Dr. Phillip Curry. Arthur's mother, Elaine, died in childbirth and Dr. Curry was forced to use a mutagenic serum on his son when he was born three months premature. Arthur has lived his whole life in the <b>main</b> <b>tank</b> of his father's research facility at Avalon Cay, his only window to the outside world being television.|$|E
25|$|The T-26 {{remained}} the <b>main</b> <b>tank</b> of the Finnish Armoured Division throughout the war, although the German StuG III began {{to replace it}} in 1943. Peak numbers in Finnish service occurred {{during the summer of}} 1944, when the Finns kept up to 126 various T-26 tanks, including 22 rebuilt Vickers 6-Ton (T-26E), 2 T-26 mod. 1931, 1 KhT-26, 63 T-26 mod. 1933, 36 T-26 mod. 1938/1939, and 2 T-26T artillery tractors. About 75 T-26s and 19 T-26Es continued in service {{after the end of the}} World War II. Some of these tanks were kept as training vehicles until 1960, when they were finally phased out and replaced by newer British and Soviet tanks. In January 1960, the Finnish Army still had 21 T-26 tanks of various types in service, and the last Finnish T-26 was officially retired in 1961 (!).|$|E
25|$|Gamelin was right; most reserve {{divisions}} had by {{now been}} committed. The only armoured division still in reserve, 2nd DCR, attacked on the 16th. However the French armoured {{divisions of the}} Infantry, the Divisions Cuirassées de Réserve, were despite their name very specialized breakthrough units, optimized for attacking fortified positions. They could be quite useful for defence, if dug in, but had very limited utility for an encounter fight: they could not execute combined infantry-tank tactics as they simply had no important motorized infantry component; they had poor tactical mobility as the heavy Char B1 bis, their <b>main</b> <b>tank</b> in which half of the French tank budget had been invested, had to refuel twice a day. So 2nd DCR divided itself in a covering screen, the small subunits of which fought bravely – but without having any strategic effect.|$|E

25|$|On 26 May 1922, {{a long-distance}} one-man {{non-stop}} record was set when Lt. Crocker {{when he made}} a non-stop flight from the Mexican Gulf Coast to the Canada–US Border, an approximate distance of 1200 miles, to demonstrate the mobility of the Air Service. The course was from Ellington Field, Texas to {{the waters of the}} Gulf thence to the Canada–US border just below Detroit, Michigan, landing at Selfridge Field. This distance was greater than from some other cities along the Gulf, but since a large field was necessary for the heavily laden plane to take off, Ellington Field was selected as the starting point. The plane used was a special built DH-4 and designated as DH-4B1S. The <b>main</b> <b>tank</b> had a gas capacity of 240 gallons and the reserve 28 gallons, with a 24-gallon tank for oil. Taking off from Ellington, he landed at Selfridge after 11 hours and 55 minutes in the air.|$|E
25|$|At Lindbergh's request, {{the large}} main and forward fuel tanks {{were placed in}} the forward section of the fuselage, in front of the pilot, with the oil tank acting as a firewall. This {{arrangement}} improved the center of gravity and reduced the risk of the pilot being crushed to death between the <b>main</b> <b>tank</b> and the engine {{in the event of a}} crash. This design decision meant that there could be no front windshield, and that forward visibility would be limited to the side windows. This did not concern Lindbergh as he was used to flying in the rear cockpit of mail planes with mail bags in the front. When he wanted to see forward, he would slightly yaw the aircraft and look out the side. To provide some forward vision as a precaution against hitting ship masts, trees, or structures while flying at low altitude, a Ryan employee who had served in the submarine service installed a periscope which Lindbergh helped design. It is unclear whether the periscope was used during the flight. The instrument panel housed fuel pressure, oil pressure and temperature gauges, a clock, altimeter, tachometer, airspeed indicator, bank and turn indicator, and a liquid magnetic compass. The main compass was mounted behind Lindbergh in the cockpit, and he read it using the mirror from a women's makeup case which was mounted to the ceiling using chewing gum. Lindbergh also installed a newly developed Earth Inductor Compass made by the Pioneer Instrument Company which allowed him to more accurately navigate while taking account of the magnetic declination of the earth. Lindbergh's ultimate arrival in Ireland deviated from his flight plan by just a few miles.|$|E
500|$|The [...] Škoda T-11/0 four-cylinder, {{water-cooled}} engine produced [...] at 1,800rpm. Two {{fuel tanks}} were fitted, the <b>main</b> <b>tank</b> with {{a capacity of}} [...] was {{on the left side}} of the engine and the [...] auxiliary tank was on the other side. The engine could run on gasoline, an alcohol-gasoline mixture, and [...] "Dynalkohol" [...] (an alcohol-benzole mixture). It was mounted in the rear along with the six-speed transmission which drove rear-mounted drive sprockets. The suspension was derived from the Vickers 6-Ton tank; eight small pairs of road wheels on four bogies per side, each pair of bogies sprung by a single leaf spring, a front idler wheel, and four track return wheels. An unsprung road wheel was located directly underneath the idler wheel to improve obstacle crossing. The transmission, brakes and steering were mechanically assisted with compressed air, reducing driver fatigue. This last feature proved problematic in the extreme conditions of the Eastern Front.|$|E

2500|$|Some marine aquariums {{include a}} sump, {{which is an}} {{external}} container connected to the main aquarium with a water pump. In most setups, the sump is located below the aquarium and is fed water from the <b>main</b> <b>tank</b> via an overflow. An overflow at its simplest is a round hole drilled towards {{the top of the}} tank, connected via tubing to an output below it. As the water level increases past the height of the overflow, the water [...] "overflows" [...] the tank and falls through to the sump below. The water circulation is powered by a water pump in the sump, which pushes the water back into the tank, thus causing more water to flow over and perpetuating the cycle. There are many advantages to using a sump, both for the appearance and the health of the tank. The sump helps the appearance of the tank, because it allows filtration and maintenance equipment (protein skimmer, heater, activated carbon) to be kept {{out of sight of the}} <b>main</b> <b>tank.</b> It also ensures that the water level of the main aquarium never changes, as the overflow sets the water level in the <b>main</b> <b>tank.</b> The sump aids tank health by helping to oxygenate the water by increasing the amount of water/air surface area used for gas exchange.|$|E
