5|$|Observations of {{globular}} clusters show that these stellar formations arise primarily in regions of efficient star formation, {{and where the}} interstellar <b>medium</b> <b>is</b> at a higher density than in normal star-forming regions. Globular cluster formation is prevalent in starburst regions and in interacting galaxies.

The mass of the SMBH in such a galaxy is often close to the combined mass of the galaxy's {{globular clusters}}.|$|E
5|$|The dust {{present in}} the {{interstellar}} <b>medium</b> <b>is</b> opaque to visual light.

Infrared is also used to observe distant, red-shifted galaxies that were formed much earlier {{in the history of the}} Universe. Water vapor and carbon dioxide absorb a number of useful portions of the infrared spectrum, so high-altitude or space-based telescopes are used for infrared astronomy.|$|E
5|$|The {{experimental}} determination of pKa values is commonly performed {{by means of}} titrations, in a medium of high ionic strength and at constant temperature. A typical procedure would be as follows. A solution of the compound in the <b>medium</b> <b>is</b> acidified with a strong acid {{to the point where}} the compound is fully protonated. The solution is then titrated with a strong base until all the protons have been removed. At each point in the titration pH is measured using a glass electrode and a pH meter. The equilibrium constants are found by fitting calculated pH values to the observed values, using the method of least squares.|$|E

5|$|The {{interactions}} of carbonate anions with uranium(VI) cause the Pourbaix diagram to change greatly when the <b>medium</b> <b>is</b> changed from {{water to a}} carbonate containing solution. While {{the vast majority of}} carbonates are insoluble in water (students are often taught that all carbonates other than those of alkali metals are insoluble in water), uranium carbonates are often soluble in water. This is because a U(VI) cation is able to bind two terminal oxides and three or more carbonates to form anionic complexes.|$|E

5|$|The local {{interstellar}} <b>medium</b> <b>is</b> {{a region}} of space within 100parsecs (pc) of the Sun, which is of interest both for its proximity and for its interaction with the Solar System. This volume nearly coincides with {{a region of}} space known as the Local Bubble, which {{is characterized by a}} lack of dense, cold clouds. It forms a cavity in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way galaxy, with dense molecular clouds lying along the borders, such as those in the constellations of Ophiuchus and Taurus. (The actual distance to the border of this cavity varies from 60 to 250pc or more.) This volume contains about 104–105 stars and the local interstellar gas counterbalances the astrospheres that surround these stars, with the volume of each sphere varying depending on the local density of the interstellar medium. The Local Bubble contains dozens of warm interstellar clouds with temperatures of up to 7,000K and radii of 0.5–5pc.|$|E
