40|$|This {{presentation}} discusses electronic theses and dissertations at the University of North Texas (<b>UNT).</b> <b>UNT</b> began <b>mandatory</b> ETDs {{for both}} theses and dissertations in fall 1999, {{making it the}} 3 rd institution {{in the world to}} go "electronic" in this way. There have been challenges along the way, but from the very beginning there has been a close and cordial relationship between the Grad School and the Libraries which serves to "book end" the student's ETD experience in a meaningful and productive way. During this session, UNT's ETD process from start to finish will be explained, especially {{the ways in which the}} Grad School and the Libraries work together to enhance the lifecycle management of students' research output at UNT...|$|R

On November12,2008, the studio released the first trailer for 2012. With a tsunami surging over the Himalayas and a purportedly-scientific message {{that the world would}} end in 2012, the <b>trailer's</b> <b>message</b> was that international governments were not preparing their populations for the event. The trailer ended with a suggestion to viewers to [...] "find out the truth" [...] by entering [...] "2012" [...] on a search engine. The Guardian called the film's marketing [...] "deeply flawed", associating it with [...] "websites that make even more spurious claims about 2012".|$|R
5000|$|In a wrapped {{butterfly}} network (which means rank 0 gets {{merged with}} rank 3. In figure 2, it {{is shown by}} replicating the processor nodes below rank 3), a message is sent from processor 5 to processor 2. The packet transmitted over the link is of the form: The header contains the destination of the message, which is processor 2 (010 in binary). The payload is the <b>message</b> 'M' and <b>trailer</b> contains checksum. Therefore the actual message transmitted from processor 5 is:Upon reaching a switching node, {{one of the two}} output links is selected based on the most significant bit of the destination address. If that bit is zero, the left link is selected. If that bit is one, the right link is selected. Subsequently, this bit is removed from the destination address in the packet transmitted through the selected link. This is shown in figure 2.|$|R

R. 3. 1 PRINCIPLES The RETANN message is sent from a customer to a supplier, to notify an intention to return books to the supplier and to request authorisation where needed. Overstock returns and returns due to discrepancies or defects in delivered items are all handled as part of a single process and may be listed in a single message. The message also allows a customer to notify a delivery shortage or an invoiced price or discount discrepancy, though this does not of course lead to a return – it simply alerts the supplier to take appropriate action. Like all EDIFACT transaction messages, RETANN has a header, a variable number of message lines (up to a maximum of 9, 999 in a single <b>message),</b> and a <b>trailer.</b> Schematically, the <b>message</b> structure looks like this...|$|R
