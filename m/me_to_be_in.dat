500|$|The {{following}} year, Domínguez {{signed with}} the Atlanta Beat in the Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA), the top division of professional soccer in the United States at the time. She was the first Mexican-born player to sign with the league {{since its inception in}} 2001. During her first month with the team, she was named the league's Player of the Month after scoring five goals and two assists in three games. [...] She scored seven goals during the 2003 season and was a leading scorer in the league. Of her experience, she said, [...] "It's very special for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the top scoring position in this league. It's the best thing that has happened to me in my career, right up there with scoring in the 1999 Women's World Cup." [...] The Beat finished second in the standings with a 9–4–8 record.|$|E

The comparison between Le Corbusier’s heavy block and Niemeyer’s startling, elegantly articulated composition seemed to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> everyone’s mind..." [...] Later on, Corbusier came once again to Niemeyer and asked him to reposition the Assembly Hall back {{to the center of the}} site. Such modification would destroy Niemeyer’s plans for a large civic square. However, he finally decided to accept the modification: [...] "I felt [...] would like to do his project, and he was the master. I do not regret my decision." [...] Together, they submitted the scheme 23–32, which was built and is what can be seen today. Along with suggestions from the other members of the Board of Design Consultants, this was developed into project 42G. [...] This late project was built with some reductions and other modifications.|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} year, Alfred Hitchcock {{cast her}} in Family Plot as a bogus spiritualist hunting with her cab driver boyfriend {{for a missing}} heir and a family fortune. Among a cast that included Bruce Dern, William Devane, and Karen Black, Hitchcock was particularly delighted by Harris' quirkiness, skill and intelligence. She received praise from critics {{as well as a}} Golden Globe nomination for the film, which was based upon the novel The Rainbird Pattern by Victor Canning and which marked a reunion of Hitchcock with Ernest Lehman, who had created the original screenplay for North by Northwest. In her 2002 Phoenix New Times interview, she admitted that she [...] "turned down Alfred Hitchcock when he first asked <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> one of his movies". After agreeing to star in Family Plot, she recalled that [...] "Hitchcock was a wonderful man".|$|E

The Shankar-affiliated East Meets West Music (EMWMusic) remastered the film and released it on DVD in October 2010, with the new title Raga: A Film Journey into the Soul of India. The release was part of EMWMusic's celebrations for Shankar's 90th birthday. Shankar said of his reasons for reissuing the film: [...] "It was a very special period of my life. I really want today's generation {{to see what it}} was like for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> such a unique and exciting position – to be the first to bridge the gap between the East and the West and to devise a new way to attract, educate, initiate and draw those in the West to the exceptional world of Indian classical music and culture." ...|$|E
2500|$|Between 1983 and 1986, Landy charged about $430,000 annually. When he {{requested}} more money, Carl Wilson {{was obliged to}} give away a quarter of Brian's publishing royalties. In 1988, Wilson said that [...] "Dr. Landy doesn't like <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> touch with my family too much. He thinks it's unhealthy." [...] Landy responded to the charges that he exerted too much control on the songwriter: [...] "He's got a car phone in his car. If he wants to call somebody, he calls somebody... He can go anywhere, on his own, anytime he wants." [...] Regarding Wilson's relationship to the Beach Boys at that time, Wilson added: [...] "Although we stay together as a group, as people we're {{a far cry from}} friends. One time we were doing an interview together, and the interviewer asked Carl what it was between him and me. He goes, 'Well, Brian and I don't have to talk to each other. We're just Beach Boys, but we don't need to be friends.' And that's true. Although, whenever I think about him, I feel rotten." ...|$|E
2500|$|In mid-2009, Epic {{ended their}} {{contract}} with Norwood following {{the appointment of}} Amanda Ghost, making Human her only album with the label. A Los Angeles Times article later revealed Norwood's discontent {{with the success of}} the project the following year when asked about the commercial failure of Human: [...] "It was lacking my belief in it. It lacked my vision. Pretty much bottom line, if you don't believe in something it's not going to go," [...] she said. [...] "So do I believe that Human was as creative as Never Say Never and Full Moon? No, I do not. You definitely want to put something out that's like that. I felt at the same time I could have had much better songs and a much better set-up." [...] A statement she made during a 2010 interview with Out magazine turned out more harsh: [...] "To hell with that album! [...] Where I felt creatively it could've gone and the space I was in creatively, I needed everybody around <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> that same space. It would've been a different album, but with the same inspiration and same blessing for other people. It would've been hotter music and a hotter look." ...|$|E
