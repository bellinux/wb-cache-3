5|$|Terraforming is {{a natural}} {{outgrowth}} of colonizing an alien world. The first playable prototype was just a map generator that tested climate changes during the game. This required the designers to create a world builder program and climatic model far more powerful than anything they'd done before. Temperature, wind, and rainfall patterns were modeled in ways that allow players to make changes: for example, creating a ridge-line and then watching the effects. In addition to raising terrain, the player can also divert rivers, dig huge boreholes into the planet's mantle, and <b>melt</b> <b>ice</b> caps.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{evaporation}} ponds at {{the edges}} of the lake produce salts and brine (water with high salt quantity). Minerals extracted from the lake include: sodium chloride (common salt), used in water softeners, salt lick blocks for livestock, and to <b>melt</b> <b>ice</b> on local roadways (food-grade salt is not produced from the lake, as it would require further costly processing to ensure its purity); potassium sulfate, used as a commercial fertilizer; and magnesium-chloride brine, used in the production of magnesium metal, chlorine gas, and as a dust suppressant. US Magnesium operates a plant on the southwest shore of the lake, which produces 14 percent of the worldwide supply of magnesium, more than any other North American magnesium operation. Mineral-extraction companies operating on the lake pay royalties on their products to the State of Utah, which owns the lake.|$|E

This paper applied power electronic frequency conversion technology to design a excitation <b>melting</b> <b>ice</b> device with 18 KV/ 40 KHZ. This device is adopted PWM control technology, and is mainly composed of the rectifier, controller and inverter. For the small frequency converter, the high-voltage frequency conversion function can be achieved through each phase in series divided voltage method. According to the 1000 kV AC ultrahigh voltage transmission lines, a <b>melting</b> <b>ice</b> model is set up by using SIMULINK simulation.

Based on the heat equation {{of transmission}} line icing, this paper analyse the different situation of non-icing and icing. Then calculate the critical prevent <b>icing</b> current and <b>melt</b> <b>icing</b> current according to the heat equation and the characteristic of icing. And {{the result showed that}} the critical prevent icing current is much less than the critical current of <b>melt</b> <b>icing.</b> Though comparing with the maximum allowable current, the scope of the prevent <b>icing</b> and <b>melt</b> <b>icing,</b> without switching off the line, is on show. So the feasibility of prevent icing is better than <b>melt</b> <b>icing</b> when the line is running always.

25|$|While {{snow and}} ice act to {{insulate}} the surface from large energy losses in winter, they also act to retard warming {{in the spring and}} summer because of the large amount of energy required to <b>melt</b> <b>ice</b> (the latent heat of fusion, 3.34 x 105 J/kg at 0°C). However, the strong static stability of the atmosphere over areas of extensive snow or ice tends to confine the immediate cooling effect to a relatively shallow layer, so that associated atmospheric anomalies are usually short-lived and local to regional in scale. In some areas of the world such as Eurasia, however, the cooling associated with a heavy snowpack and moist spring soils is known to play a role in modulating the summer monsoon circulation. Gutzler and Preston (1997) recently presented evidence for a similar snow-summer circulation feedback over the southwestern United States.|$|E
500|$|On December 27, 1999, {{the state}} awarded a $85.7million {{contract}} (equivalent to $ in [...] ) for {{the replacement of}} the S-Curve on US131. Deposits of gypsum under the roadway were dissolving and causing it to settle. A deteriorating bridge also forced the reconstruction of the freeway through the area. Construction began on January 15, 2000, diverting the roughly 115,000vehicles per day that used the stretch of road to detours through the downtown area. As part of the project, a $1.2million (equivalent to $ in [...] ) de-icing system was installed. The system is designed to spray a de-icing fluid on the roadway that would be carried by car tires up to a mile (1.6km) along the road surface. This fluid is expected to <b>melt</b> <b>ice</b> at temperatures below the [...] at which salt stops working. [...] Unlike salt, the non-corrosive de-icer does not harm the bridge, but it is more costly. The system is designed to be activated manually, or automatically via sensors along the road. However, plowing would still be required on the roadway. The idea behind the de-icing system is to keep the pavement wet and prevent the formation of ice.|$|E

2500|$|The {{problem of}} leaks is further aggravated {{by the fact}} that many of them involve {{corrosive}} salt water. This is caused by the proximity of Boston Harbor and the Atlantic Ocean, causing a mix of salt and fresh water leaks in the tunnel. The situation is made worse by road salt spread in the tunnel to <b>melt</b> <b>ice</b> during freezing weather, or brought in by vehicles passing through. Salt water and salt spray are well-known issues that must be dealt with in any marine environment. It has been reported that [...] "hundreds of thousands of gallons of salt water are pumped out monthly" [...] in the Big Dig, and a map has been prepared showing [...] "hot spots" [...] where water leakage is especially serious. Salt-accelerated corrosion has caused ceiling light fixtures to fail (see below), but can also cause rapid deterioration of embedded rebar and other structural steel reinforcements holding the tunnel walls and ceiling in place.|$|E
2500|$|Results {{published}} in the journal Science after the mission ended reported that chloride, bicarbonate, magnesium, sodium potassium, calcium, and possibly sulfate were detected in the samples. The pH was narrowed down to 7.7 ±0.5. Perchlorate (ClO4), a strong oxidizer at elevated temperatures, was detected. This was a significant discovery as perchlorate has the potential of being used for rocket fuel and as a source of oxygen for future colonists. Under certain conditions perchlorate can inhibit life; however some microorganisms obtain energy from the substance (by anaerobic reduction). The chemical when mixed with water can greatly lower freezing point of water, {{in a manner similar to}} how salt is applied to roads to <b>melt</b> <b>ice.</b> So, perchlorate may be allowing small amounts of liquid water to form on the surface of Mars today. Gullies, which are common in certain areas of Mars, may have formed from perchlorate melting ice and causing water to erode soil on steep slopes. Perchlorates have also been detected at the landing site of the Curiosity rover, nearer equatorial Mars, suggesting a [...] "global distribution of these salts".|$|E
