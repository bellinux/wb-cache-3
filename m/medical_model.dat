25|$|Psychotherapies are {{categorized}} {{in several}} different ways. A distinction can be made between those based on a <b>medical</b> <b>model</b> and those based on a humanistic model. In the <b>medical</b> <b>model</b> the client is seen as unwell and the therapist employs their skill to help the client back to health. The extensive use of the DSM-IV, {{the diagnostic and statistical}} manual of mental disorders in the United States, is an example of a medically exclusive model. The humanistic or non-medical model in contrast strives to depathologise the human condition. The therapist attempts to create a relational environment conducive to experiential learning and help build the client's confidence in their own natural process resulting in a deeper understanding of themselves. The therapist may see themselves as a facilitator/helper.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} to show the usefulness of rapid prototyping (RP) <b>medical</b> <b>models</b> in dysplastic hip orthopaedic surgery. There {{is a lack of}} published information on the use of RP <b>medical</b> <b>models</b> in planning of dysplastic hip orthopaedic surgery, so this {{research was}} conducted to provide such information. Computed tomography (CT) of a patient with a dysplastic hip was used. Special medical software was used to prepare the three-dimensional model of the patient, which was then used to produce the RP <b>medical</b> <b>models.</b> These models were then given to the orthopaedic surgeons to plan for the dysplastic hip surgeries. Measurements on the CT scan data were taken before surgery. Finally, surgeons' comments on their experience of planning dysplastic hip surgery with the use of RP <b>medical</b> <b>models</b> were obtained. The CT scan measurements taken before surgery indicated the severity of the dysplastic hip in each patient. Surgeons found the RP <b>medical</b> <b>models</b> to be very useful in planning of surgery, as they helped them to make decisions, increased their confidence, and also reduced surgery time. The results obtained show the effectiveness of using RP <b>medical</b> <b>models</b> in planning of dysplastic hip orthopaedic surgery. This research provides an understanding of the use of RP <b>medical</b> <b>models</b> in planning of dysplastic hip orthopaedic surgery. Surgeons had fresh experience of using models that greatly influenced the success of the surgery...|$|R

Respective Rapid Prototyping methods i. e. JS-PolyJet, Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), ProJet and Vacuum Casting (VS) methods are alsocharacterised. The possibilities of using the above in model research and especially in photoelastic research on the examples of humanskull top part and a fragment of syndesmosis of the skull are discussed. Rapid Prototyping and Rapid Tooling methods together withcomputer aided systems CAD/CAM make it possible to carry out numerical analysis and experimental tests on models of very complicated inside and outside shapes. RP techniques allow for fabricating <b>medical</b> <b>models</b> of a tissue structure of human skeleton bones. In case of photoelastic tests, when examined medical object can be destructed, RT techniques and precisely Vacuum Casting method allows for making <b>medical</b> <b>models</b> with reasonable prices and quantities adequate for experimental aims.

25|$|Although {{clinical}} {{psychologists and}} psychiatrists {{can be said}} to share a same fundamental aim—the alleviation of mental distress—their training, outlook, and methodologies are often quite different. Perhaps the most significant difference is that psychiatrists are licensed physicians. As such, psychiatrists often use the <b>medical</b> <b>model</b> to assess psychological problems (i.e., those they treat are seen as patients with an illness) and rely on psychotropic medications as the chief method of addressing the illness—although many also employ psychotherapy as well. Psychiatrists and medical psychologists (who are clinical psychologists that are also licensed to prescribe) are able to conduct physical examinations, order and interpret laboratory tests and EEGs, and may order brain imaging studies such as CT or CAT, MRI, and PET scanning.|$|E

There are criticisms of the <b>medical</b> <b>model</b> approach from within and without the psychiatric profession (see references): it is said to neglect the role of environmental, family, and cultural influences, to discount the psychological meaning of behavior and symptoms, to promote a view of the [...] "patient" [...] as dependent and needing to be cured or cared for and therefore undermines a sense of personal responsibility for conduct and behavior, to promote a normative conception based on adaptation to the norms of society (the ill person must adapt to society), and {{to be based on the}} shaky foundations of reliance on a classificatory system that has been shown to have problems of validity and reliability (Boorse, 1976; Jensen, 2003; Sadler et al. 1994; Timimi, 2006).|$|E

40|$|New Virtual Reality {{technologies}} {{provide the}} possibility of widening access to information in data. Haptics, the technology of touch, could be an interesting future aid and have large impact on medical applications. The use of haptic devices allows computer users to use their sense of touch, in order to feel virtual objects {{with a high degree}} of realism. The aim of the thesis is to investigate the potential deployment and the benefits of using haptic force feedback instruments in maxillo-facial surgery. Based on a produced test application, the thesis includes suggested recommendations for future haptic implementations. At the Department of Maxillo-Facial Surgery, at the Karolinska Hospital in Stockholm, Virtual Reality technologies are used as an aid to a limited extent during the production of physical <b>medical</b> <b>models.</b> The physical <b>medical</b> <b>models</b> are produced with Rapid Prototyping techniques. This process is examined and described in the thesis. Moreover, the future of the physical <b>medical</b> <b>models</b> is outlined, and a future alternative visualizing patient data in 3 D and use haptics as an interaction tool, is described. Furthermore, we have examined the present use of haptic technology in medicine, and the benefits of using the technology as an aid for diagnostic and treatment planning. Based on a presented literature study and an international outlook, we found that haptics could improve the management of <b>medical</b> <b>models.</b> The technology could be an aid, both for physical models as well as for virtual models. We found three different ways of implementing haptics in maxillo-facial surgery. A haptic system could be developed in order to only manage virtual <b>medical</b> <b>models</b> and be an alternative solution to the complete Rapid Prototyping process. A haptic system could serve as a software, handling the image processing and interfacing from a medical scanner to an Rapid Prototyping system. A haptic system could be developed as an alternative interaction tool, which could be implemented as an additional function in currently used image processing software, in order to improve the management of virtual <b>medical</b> <b>models</b> before the Rapid Prototyping process. An implementation for planning and examination in maxillo-facial surgery, using haptic force feedback interaction, is developed and evaluated. The test implementation is underlying our aim of investigating the potential deployment and the benefits of using haptic force feedback instruments in maxillo-facial surgery. After discussing the possible future of our implementation and the future of haptic force feedback in maxillo-facial surgery, a recommendation is given as a conclusion of our total work...|$|R

Torrey has been a long-time critic of the Center for Mental Health Services that provides support and advocacy, {{on the grounds that they}} support anti-psychiatry groups and those opposed to outpatient commitment, claiming they neglect the seriously mentally ill due to a hippie '60s attitude, distribute funds on the basis of other factors such as [...] "community cohesion" [...] and ethnic minority involvement, and are more dysfunctional than the individuals they are supposed to help. He has specifically opposed public funding for the National Empowerment Center, for rejecting the <b>medical</b> <b>model</b> and arguing for a recovery model without necessarily needing medication; it has since lost its funding from the CMHS. Torrey has in general been instrumental in lobbying against, and undermining, community-based consumer projects because they promoted social and experiential recovery and questioned the standard <b>medical</b> <b>model.</b> Consumer organizations have protested that they are already economically disadvantaged and vulnerable to political whim while Torrey and his organizations have rich and powerful backers. It has been argued that Torrey and other psychiatric and family member advocates do not necessarily have the same interests as consumers/survivors themselves. Differences in ideology sharpened after the development of NAMI. In criticizing the New Freedom Commission on Mental Health for not recommending forced outpatient medicating, Torrey claimed that stigma against people with mental disorders was largely due to them committing violent acts due to not taking medication, and called the recovery model harmful for sending a cruel message of hope, or implicit blame, to those he believes cannot engage in a recovery process, despite being a laudable long-term vision for the Commission. Torrey hopes to live long enough to see vaccines to prevent many or most cases of schizophrenia.|$|E

40|$|Model-based {{development}} is a widely-used method to describe complex systems that enables the rapid prototyping. Advances in the science of distributed systems {{has led to the}} development of large scale statechart models which are distributed among multiple locations. Taking medicine for example, models of best-practice guidelines during rural ambulance transport are distributed across hospital settings from a rural hospital, to an ambulance, to a central tertiary hospital. Unfortunately, these <b>medical</b> <b>models</b> require continuous and real-time communication across individual <b>medical</b> <b>models</b> in physically distributed treatment locations which provides vital assistance to the clinicians and physicians. This makes it necessary to offer methods for model-driven communication and synchronization in a distributed environment. In this paper, we describe ModelSink, a middleware to address the problem of communication and synchronization of heterogeneous distributed models. Being motivated by the synchronization requirements during emergency ambulance transport, we use <b>medical</b> best-practice <b>models</b> as a case study to illustrate the notion of distributed models. Through ModelSink, we achieve an efficient communication architecture, open-loop-safe protocol, and queuing and mapping mechanisms compliant with the semantics of statechart-based model-driven development. We evaluated the performance of ModelSink on distributed sets of <b>medical</b> <b>models</b> that we have developed to assess how ModelSink performs in various loads. Our work is intended to assist clinicians, EMT, and medical staff to prevent unintended deviations from medical best practices, and overcome connectivity and coordination challenges that exist in a distributed hospital network. Our practice suggests that there are in fact additional potential domains beyond medicine where our middleware can provide needed utility.
