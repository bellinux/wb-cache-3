5|$|Strandzha Nature Park has {{the richest}} {{vertebrate}} fauna among all protected areas in Bulgaria— 410 species, not counting 70 species of marine fishes. There are 66 breeding mammal species. Among {{the most common}} are the roe deer, red deer, wild boar, grey wolf, golden jackal, red fox, European badger, and beech marten. The park protects {{some of the largest}} and most important populations of European otter and wildcat in Europe. The European pine marten and <b>marbled</b> <b>polecat</b> are uncommon in Strandzha. There are 25 bat species present including Bechstein's bat and Kuhl's pipistrelle. 27 species of small mammals at the park include European ground squirrel, lesser mole-rat, Günther's vole, three dormouse species, and two other globally threatened species. The park is an important sanctuary of the Roach's mouse-tailed dormouse. There have been reports on the presence of Mediterranean monk seals in the rocks and caverns of Silistar.|$|E
25|$|To dig, {{such as when}} {{excavating}} dens, the <b>marbled</b> <b>polecat</b> digs out {{earth with}} its forelegs while anchoring itself with its chin and hind legs. It will use its teeth to pull out obstacles such as roots.|$|E
25|$|When alarmed, a <b>marbled</b> <b>polecat</b> {{will raise}} {{up on its}} legs while arching its back and curling its tail over the back, with the long tail hair erect. It may also raise its head, bare its teeth, and give shrill, short hisses. If threatened, it can expel a foul-smelling {{secretion}} from enlarged anal glands under the tail.|$|E
25|$|Burrows {{of large}} ground {{squirrels}} or similar rodents {{such as the}} great gerbil (Rhombomys opinus) and Libyan jird are used by <b>marbled</b> <b>polecats</b> for resting and breeding. They may also dig their own dens or live in underground irrigation tunnels. In the winter, <b>marbled</b> <b>polecats</b> will line their dens with grass.|$|R
25|$|In 1945, Kabul shopkeepers were {{reported}} to have kept <b>marbled</b> <b>polecats</b> to exterminate rodents. Their journals also show some developed an adverse reaction to the strong smell they emit when threatened. Side effects varied from fever to diarrhea.|$|R
25|$|Marbled polecats mate from March {{to early}} June. Their mating calls {{are most often}} heard as low {{rumbling}} sounds in a slow rhythm. Gestation can be long and variable (243days to 327days). Parturition has been observed to occur from late January to mid-March. Delayed implantation allows <b>marbled</b> <b>polecats</b> to time {{the birth of their}} cubs for favorable conditions, such as when prey is abundant.|$|R
25|$|In 2008, V. peregusna was {{classified}} as a vulnerable species in the IUCN Red List due to a population reduction of at least 30% in the previous 10 years.

50|$|Despite {{the harsh}} conditions, these deserts and the {{surrounding}} regions sustain many animals, including black-tailed gazelles, <b>marbled</b> <b>polecats,</b> wild Bactrian camels, Mongolian wild ass and sandplovers. They are occasionally visited by snow leopards, brown bears, and wolves. Drought-adapted shrubs in the desert included gray sparrow's saltwort (Salsola passerina), gray sagebrush, and low grasses such as needle grass and bridlegrass. Several large nature reserves have been established in the Gobi, including Gobi Gurvansaikhan National Park, Great Gobi A and Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area.|$|R
