500|$|Gina McIntyre of Los Angeles Times {{said that}} the program {{delivered}} what she described as a [...] "blood bath," [...] and Aaron Rutzkoff of The Wall Street Journal further analyzed that the episode followed a dark and frenetic convention [...] "with flare." [...] The Washington Post commentator Jen Chaney opined that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] evoked elements of various films of George Romero, {{as well as the}} historical epic film Gone with the Wind (1939). Writing for Paste, Josh Jackson issued the episode an 8.8 out of 10 rating, signifying a [...] "commendable" [...] rating. [...] "'Beside the Dying Fire' wasted no time getting straight to the action, assuming a season’s worth of character development was more than enough." [...] The Huffington Post Maureen Ryan echoed synonymous sentiments, ultimately declaring that the telecast was the best since the series' pilot episode, [...] "Days Gone Bye." [...] Ryan summated: [...] "The first two acts of The Walking Dead Season 2 finale were full of excitement, honest to God suspense and characters who came up with pretty decent plans on the fly. When the braaaains finally hit the fan at Hershel Greene's farm, <b>my</b> <b>pulse</b> quickened and I found myself wondering and even caring about the survival of characters who'd done little more than irritate me for weeks." [...] Julia Rhodes from California Literary Review uttered that the show returned to form in [...] "Beside the Dying Fire," [...] while Buddy TV writer Megan Cole summed up the episode as [...] "intense." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gordeeva and Grinkov won {{almost every}} {{competition}} they entered. In the 31 competitions whose results are {{known at the}} senior and professional levels, they finished first 24 times, and never lower than second {{from the time they}} won their first senior world title. They {{are one of the few}} pair teams in history to successfully complete a quadruple twist lift in international competition. [...] They landed the difficult element with ease at the 1987 World Championships. They also completed the element at the 1987 European Championships, but due to a problem with Grinkov's boot strap and a misunderstanding about the rules (the referee signaled them to stop, going so far as to turn off their music but they continued skating), they were disqualified from that event. They stopped performing the quad twist because it made no significant improvement to their marks, [...] making the added physical stress unnecessary. [...] Katia states in her book, [...] "My Sergei: A Love Story" [...] that this element raised her heart rate and blood pressure to levels that alarmed the Soviet team's Doctors: [...] "That summer we had learned a very difficult move called the quadruple split twist, in which Sergei threw me in the air, I did a split, then closed my legs and made four turns before he caught me. We were the only pair to do this quadruple element, and it was very exhausting—more exhausting than difficult, really. Soviet doctors had measured <b>my</b> <b>pulse</b> rate as exceeding two hundred beats per minute when I did it." ...|$|E
60|$|I kept quiet, yet {{internally}} I {{was much}} agitated: <b>my</b> <b>pulse</b> fluttered, {{and the blood}} left my cheek, which turned cold.|$|E
60|$|But unto thee, {{when the}}e I meet, <b>My</b> <b>pulses</b> thicken fast, As when the maddened lake grows black And ruffles in the blast.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is {{that not}} enough, Sire?" [...] I cried. My heart beat quickly, and <b>my</b> <b>pulses</b> throbbed with the {{suspense}} of that portentous moment.|$|R
60|$|Marvel through <b>my</b> <b>pulses</b> ran Seeing {{then the}} beam divine Swiftly on this hand decline, While Earth's splendor and renown Mounted light as thistle-down.|$|R
60|$|Dr. Stamford tramped up hurriedly. He seized <b>my</b> <b>pulse</b> {{as though}} it were his own {{property}} that I had escaped with.|$|E
6000|$|... "Doc felt <b>my</b> <b>pulse,</b> {{and then}} he began to mess up some calomel with an {{agricultural}} implement that belonged to the trowel class.|$|E
60|$|I {{answered}} by a sob; and my visitor then felt <b>my</b> <b>pulse</b> and temples, and set himself to wash and dress the wound upon my scalp.|$|E
6000|$|Many {{a morning}} on the moorland did we hear the copses ring, [...] And her whisper throng'd <b>my</b> <b>pulses</b> with the fulness of the Spring.|$|R
6000|$|Scarcely breathing, {{and distracted}} the while by the mad racing of <b>my</b> <b>pulses,</b> I read; and this, as nearly as I can remember, {{is what the}} letter contained: ...|$|R
60|$|I {{felt that}} he was {{watching}} me keenly and made a great effort to remain composed, although <b>my</b> <b>pulses</b> were beating fast and I felt my colour rising.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was born}} amongst the mountains, sir," [...] I answered, <b>my</b> <b>pulse</b> {{quickening}} at his description, [...] "but {{they were not}} so high as those you speak of." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{sent for}} Radcliff; was so ill, [...] That other doctors gave me over: [...] He felt <b>my</b> <b>pulse,</b> {{prescribed}} a pill, [...] And I {{was likely to}} recover.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{how could}} you dream of meeting?' [...] Nay, how can you ask me, sweet? All day <b>my</b> <b>pulse</b> had been beating [...] The tune of your coming feet.|$|E
60|$|The knot in {{my throat}} was dissolved. <b>My</b> <b>pulses</b> quickened with anticipation. I dug my heels into the mule's belly and pushed on, the portly cleric at my side.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why then, monsieur," [...] {{she cried}} in an eager voice, that set <b>my</b> <b>pulses</b> throbbing, [...] "you'll not deny me the boon I crave? You'll not deny me his life?" ...|$|R
60|$|Here I am--get up {{and come}} to me! Not as a visitor either, nor a sweet And winsome child of innocence; nor As an insolent {{mistress}} telling <b>my</b> <b>pulse's</b> beat.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} are feverish," [...] said Doña Mercedes, feeling <b>my</b> <b>pulse.</b> [...] "We must send for the doctor--we have a doctor in our little town, a very skilful man." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{placed his}} fingers upon my wrist; and holding them {{there for a}} moment, sprang to his feet, and, with much enthusiasm, {{pronounced}} me a Yankee, every beat of <b>my</b> <b>pulse!</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank God, Doctor, it has passed. I don't think <b>my</b> <b>pulse</b> went a beat faster {{when the}} guns opened on us, and the crackle {{of our own}} musketry had no more effect. I think it has gone forever." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{flashed a}} {{wonderful}} {{look at me}} across the table--such a look that my heart beat, and <b>my</b> <b>pulses</b> flowed to a strange, new music. Her tone was soft, almost caressing.|$|R
6000|$|One kiss {{from all}} others {{prevents}} me, [...] And sets all <b>my</b> <b>pulses</b> astir, And burns {{on my lips}} and torments me: [...] 'Tis the kiss that I fain would give her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Another minute, and {{she will}} despise me for a hypocrite," [...] thought I; and an impulse of fury against Reed, Brocklehurst, and Co. bounded in <b>my</b> <b>pulses</b> at the conviction. I was no Helen Burns.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jane, I {{am not a}} gentle-tempered man--you forget that: I am not long- enduring; I am {{not cool}} and dispassionate. Out of pity to me and yourself, {{put your finger on}} <b>my</b> <b>pulse,</b> feel how it throbs, and--beware!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Loved you!' she cried. 'Why, I {{have been}} as frank with you as a sister--never shunned you, never feared you. You cannot,' she affirmed triumphantly--'you cannot make me tremble with your coming, nor {{accelerate}} <b>my</b> <b>pulse</b> by your influence.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘If I were dying, I {{feel as if}} a {{word from}} you would rally me; if <b>my</b> <b>pulse</b> had stopped, I feel as if your touch would make it beat again,’ said Neville. ‘But I have rallied, and am doing famously.’ ...|$|E
60|$|I knew no fear. <b>My</b> <b>pulses</b> throbbed and <b>my</b> {{heart beat}} ponderously but rapturously as I watched the vision growing {{more and more}} {{distinct}} until I {{could make out the}} pale face of ineffable sweetness and the veiled eyes.|$|R
60|$|I {{leaned forward}} now, scarce daring to draw breath lest I should lose {{a word of}} what was to follow. The blood that had earlier surged to my face had now all receded again, and <b>my</b> <b>pulses</b> throbbed like hammers.|$|R
60|$|I clung {{with both}} hands till my nails ached, and I shut my eyes as if {{to cover up the}} peril. Gradually my mind came back again, <b>my</b> <b>pulses</b> quieted down to a more natural time, and I was once more in {{possession}} of myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "I would scorn {{to contend}} for empire with him--I would scorn it. Shall {{my left hand}} dispute for {{precedence}} with my right? Shall my heart quarrel with <b>my</b> <b>pulse?</b> Shall my veins be jealous of the blood which fills them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And Mr. Jones? I {{suppose they}} have not gone to the station. Just feel <b>my</b> <b>pulse,</b> Merton. I am afraid I am very weak." [...] Mr. Merton felt his pulse and shook his head. [...] "There isn't a pulse, so to speak." ...|$|E
60|$|When I awoke {{from the}} trance into which I had fallen, I {{found myself in}} a bath, {{surrounded}} by innumerable black faces; and a Hindoo pothukoor (whence our word apothecary) feeling <b>my</b> <b>pulse</b> and {{looking at me with}} an air of sagacity.|$|E
6000|$|... "I will prize her. The {{sense of}} her value is here, in my heart; the {{necessity}} for her society is blended with my life. Not more jealous shall I be of the blood whose flow moves <b>my</b> <b>pulses</b> than of her happiness and well-being." ...|$|R
60|$|I had {{expected}} nothing better, and dreaded {{a great deal}} worse; and <b>my</b> <b>pulses</b> throbbed furiously when, after some further speech, Haldane strolled away with a half-wistful, half-regretful glance at his daughter who approached us as we spoke. She was in high spirits, and greeted me cordially.|$|R
60|$|I bit my lip in vexation; {{but soon}} I smiled again. Were such little things to fret me? Did we not ride to Pagliano and to Bianca de' Cavalcanti? At {{the very thought}} <b>my</b> <b>pulses</b> would quicken, and a {{sweetness}} of anticipation would invade my soul, to be clouded at moments by an indefinable dread.|$|R
