500|$|After Carey {{finished}} {{writing and}} producing the track alongside Williams, Dogg added his rap verse, and added some ulterior beats and components.

I took [...] down to my studio and flipped my style to it." [...] After slightly altering the song, as well as adding his verses, Dogg met with Carey once again for her approval on the song, [...] "When I played [...] for her, she was like, 'Oh, I love it!'

His name is Sawneysson, a very giant of a man, with hair that might have grown {{on the back of}} a Greenland bear, only that it is red instead of white. He told me that he knew our father well by sight, and last saw him taking a ramble on Dunedin hill, whither he had walked from our village on the Forth, which shows that the old man's vigour has improved. Emma was with him too, so Sawneysson said, looking beautiful, but {{somewhat}} sad." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her {{complexion}} turned of {{a beautiful}} red, which I had never seen in it before; she brightened all over {{with a kind of}} speechless and breathless surprise. [...] "Who is it?"

There, coming out on us from among the hills, was a bright-eyed young gentleman, dressed in a beautiful fawn-coloured suit, with gloves and hat to match, with a rose in his button-hole, and {{a smile on his face}} that might have set the Shivering Sand itself smiling at him in return.

60|$|The {{dear old}} man tripped in his haste to get down, plunged into my bosom, threw his arms round my neck to save himself, and almost bore {{me to the}} ground.

I took the first {{opportunity}} to read it in a quiet corner. It was as follows: 'Dear Jacques--I saw how nobly you stood up for my Carrie the other day, and how you got wounded in protecting her. You have always been good to her. I have often thought I might help you to escape, but was afraid to try. Now I will do so. It will not be easy, but I will manage it. Do not be impatient; the child will give you another note when I have quite arranged things.

Depending on culture, context and relationship, <b>a</b> <b>hug</b> can indicate familiarity, love, affection, friendship, brotherhood or sympathy. <b>A</b> <b>hug</b> can indicate support, comfort, and consolation, particularly where words are insufficient. <b>A</b> <b>hug</b> usually demonstrates affection and emotional warmth, sometimes arising from joy or happiness when reunited with someone or seeing someone absent after a long time. <b>A</b> non-reciprocal <b>hug</b> may demonstrate <b>a</b> relational problem. <b>A</b> <b>hug</b> can range from a brief one second squeeze, with the arms not fully around the friend to an extended holding.

40|$|In human {{face-to-face}} communication, embodied sharing {{using the}} synchrony of embodied rhythms is promoted by embodied interactions. In particular, embodied interactions with direct contact {{are considered to}} synchronize embodied rhythms effectively. Hug behavior {{is one of the}} types of embodied interactions that involve direct contact. In hug behaviors, humans whole-body contact with each other. In the case of interaction between a human and a robot, the robot synchronizes embodied rhythms effectively using <b>hug</b> behaviors. Thus, <b>a</b> behavior model that can generate <b>a</b> <b>hug</b> behavior with humans is required for robots. Therefore, in this paper, we analyzed hug behaviors between humans and proposed <b>a</b> <b>hug</b> behavior generation model for <b>a</b> <b>hug</b> robot system based in the results of the analysis. This model generates <b>a</b> <b>hug</b> behavior in response to human behavior when a human requests <b>a</b> <b>hug</b> from the robot. Next, we developed <b>a</b> <b>hug</b> robot system that uses the proposed hug behavior generation model.
