Secondly, the charging demand of charging infrastructures is integrated into a cost-based model to evaluate the economics of candidate plans. Furthermore, load capability constraints are proposed to evaluate whether the candidate CSs deployment and tie line plans could be adopted. Different scenarios generated by load <b>profile</b> <b>templates</b> are innovatively integrated into the economic planning model to deal with uncertain operational states.

40|$|The {{development}} of remote homology detection methods is a challenging area in Bioinformatics. Sequence analysis-based approaches that {{address this problem}} have employed the use of <b>profiles,</b> <b>templates</b> and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs).

Search procedures are often asymmetrical due to over or under-representation of some protein families and outliers often remain undetected.

Methods such as MulPSSM and Cascade PSI-BLAST that employ intermediate sequences achieve better coverage of members in searches.

30|$|To {{comment on}} the general results at the {{profiles}} level, {{we were unable to}} use our approach to distinguish between students and employees (thus, natural and unnatural personae). This could be because the type of personae represented by individuals # 4 and # 5 is very similar to our natural <b>profile</b> <b>template,</b> or because there was too much variation in our sample used to define naturalness. To test this last hypothesis we adopted the approach mentioned in Step 1 that focused on defining and reflecting on the average penalty and the standard deviation for the initial participant sample. From this analysis, we found that at this level, there were six participants that had a penalty score higher than the mean penalty (0.0343) plus one standard deviation (0.0334) and one participant (of that six) with a score higher than the mean plus two standard deviations (unnatural). In some ways, these individuals could be considered as outliers whose profiles could have weakened the naturalness characterisation process.|$|R

In the case {{on the condition of}} little movement deviation of table in z direction by repeated feed operations, compensating grinding method using personal computer and actuating table is effective. From the experiments 0. 2 μm of straightness along 250 mm length at 6 mm width is obtained on the condition of work speed v= 50 mm/s. and depth of cut 1 μm. Further precise compensating grinding system is proposed. Template is set nearly and parallel to the work and displacement sensor is installed under the arm fixed on the column.

40|$|The success {{probability}} of side-channel attacks {{depends on the}} used measurement techniques {{as well as the}} algorithmic processing to exploit available leakage. This is particularly critical in case of asymmetric cryptography, where attackers are only allowed single side-channel observations because secrets are either ephemeral or blinded by countermeasures. We focus on non-profiled attacks which require less attacker privileges and cannot be prevented easily. We significantly improve the algorithmic processing in non-profiled attacks based on clustering against exponentiation-based implementations compared to previous contributions. This improvement is mainly due to PCA and a strategy to select few mid-ranked components where exploitable, low-variance leakage is concentrated. As a result from a practical experiment using single-channel high-resolution magnetic field measurements, we report a significant improvement in the number of successful attacks. Further, we present the first practical results from using three such channels simultaneously. The combination of three channels leads to further improved results over the best individual channel when applying a <b>profiled</b> <b>template</b> attack. The clustering-based algorithmic approach for the non-profiled attack, however, does not show improvements from the combination...|$|R

Wavelengths shorter than double the waveguide diameter are propagated, while longer wavelengths are reflected {{at the opening of the}} waveguide. Parallel metal strips mounted perpendicular to a transparent surface exhibit equivalent behaviour for waves polarized perpendicular to the strips. For unpolarized radiation, two of these lamellar gratings have to be crossed. These gratings are manufactured by embossing a profile of right-angle triangles onto a transparent substrate. They have a period and depth of approximately 0, 8 mym. The vertical faces of the profile are then covered with a thin conducting metal layer by oblique evaporation.
