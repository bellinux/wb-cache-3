50|$|In Australia, {{design work}} {{commenced}} on {{a version of}} MLS in 1972. Most of this work was done jointly by the Federal Department of Civil Aviation (DCA), and the Radio Physics Division of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). The project was called Interscan, one of several <b>microwave</b> <b>landing</b> <b>systems</b> under consideration internationally. Interscan was chosen by the FAA in 1975 and by ICAO in 1978 as the format to be adopted. An engineered version of the system, called MITAN, was developed by industry (Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Limited and Hawker de Havilland) under a contract with DCA's successor, the Department of Transport, and successfully demonstrated at Melbourne Airport (Tullamarine) in the late 1970s. The white antenna dishes could still be seen at Tullamarine until 2003 when they were dismantled.|$|E

The primary goal of the work is to find a cost effective way of embedding the demodulator within an integrated navigation receiver built around a customised application specific processor (ASP). While the fully digital nature of the design increases the demodulator’s immunity to analogue-related problems, the dedicated hardware approach relieves the ASP from computationally complex tasks, such as carrier acquisition and clock synchronisation. ...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Microwave</b> <b>Landing</b> <b>System</b> (MLS) allows curved approaches. The <b>Microwave</b> <b>Landing</b> <b>System</b> (MLS) {{introduced}} in the 1970s was intended to replace ILS but fell out of favour in the United States because of satellite based systems. In the 1980s, {{there was a major}} US and European effort to establish MLS. But a combination of airline reluctance to invest and the rise of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) resulted in its not being adopted in civil aviation. MLS is showing a resurgence in the United Kingdom for civil aviation. ILS and MLS are the only standardized systems in Civil Aviation that meet requirements for Category III automated landings. The first Category III MLS for civil aviation was commissioned at Heathrow airport in March 2009.|$|R

40|$|A {{powerful}} and versatile analytical approach is outlined for performing the site evaluation of Instrument Landing Systems (ILS) and <b>Microwave</b> <b>Landing</b> <b>Systems</b> (MLS) {{without resorting to}} the current experimental methods.

A multiwedge model of the terrain ahead of the antenna assembly is generated from standard survey data and an exact ray tracing procedure is evolved to trace all the rays between the antenna elements and approaching aircraft. The power of the current uniform diffraction theory (UTD) to evaluate scattered fields from wedges is extended to include the impedance and roughness of the wedge and the theory {{is applied to the}} multiwedge terrain model for evaluating the field.

This study evaluated the feasibility, benefits, and liabilities of using helicopter cockpit simulators in place of flight testing to develop enhanced TERPS criteria for non-standard flight profiles and navigation equipment. Near-term (2 to 5 year) requirements for conducting simulator studies to verify that they produce suitable data comparable to that obtained from previous flight tests are discussed.
