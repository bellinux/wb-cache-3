5|$|The Michelena Features studio {{facility}} in San Rafael sat empty through the 1920s with its solitary <b>metal-clad</b> brick vault housing all the company's nitrate films, including the earlier ones shot by CMPC. In 1931, boys {{playing with a}} firecracker at the deserted lot set the vault {{and all of its}} flammable contents spectacularly on fire. Every known copy of Michelena's movies was destroyed, a loss that Middleton estimated at $200,000; worth about $ million today. In 1996, an 82-year-old nitrate copy of Salomy Jane was found in Australia; it was sent to the Library of Congress for preservation. Awareness of Michelena's contribution to early film, and her role as a groundbreaking Hispanic star, rose in 2002 with a proclamation made by President George W. Bush upon the occasion of National Hispanic Heritage Month in which he listed her as one of America's influential Latino actors. In 2008, a new print of Salomy Jane was released for limited distribution.|$|E

The aim {{is to increase the}} wear-resistance of materials for piston seals by a means of the composition optimization, selection of composition structure, components and their relation and also development of the effective lubricants possessing a <b>metal-cladding</b> action. The tribotechnical and experimental-production tests have been performed. The influence of orientation filler on the antifrictional, thermophysical, thermofrictional properties of carboplastic has been established. The composition of antifrictional material Htibolon-B has been optimized, the <b>metal-cladding</b> compositions to the lubricants have been developed. The carbofiber Htibolon-B and <b>metal-cladding</b> compositions to lubricants have been introduced. The economic effect is 27500 roubles.

40|$|Abstract — The {{influence}} of temperature on the reflectivity of symmetrical <b>metal-cladding</b> optical waveguide (SMCOW) is studied theoretically {{by means of}} single-factor investigation under spectral and angular interrogation mode of operation. The theo-retical model for temperature dependence of reflectivity includes the temperature dependence of refractive index and thickness of guiding layer, the temperature dependence of the metal film thickness and metal-dielectric function. It is found {{that the effect of}} temperature on the reflectivity of SMCOW is mainly attributed to the temperature dependence of refractive index and thickness of guiding layer; on the contrary, the temperature properties of metal film hardly contribute to the {{influence of}} temperature on the reflectivity. Based on the analysis, the sensitivities of SMCOW with guiding layer made up of different optical glasses are computed under both spectral and angular interrogation. This letter is supposed to provide direction in designing SMCOW sensors against the temperature variation.

The high collection efficiency of a double-tapered probe was reproduced and was ascribed to the shortening of the cut off region and the efficient coupling to the guiding mode of the optical fiber.

This configuration permits a strong interaction between the optical field and the sensing film. Several devices having different thickness of the porphyrin guiding layer are investigated as sensors of ethanol vapours in air at several concentrations.

30|$|Plasmonic {{cavities}} {{are particularly}} attractive for nano-scale photonic applications as their physical sizes can be {{smaller than the}} diffraction limit of light [1 – 9], whereas the dimensions of conventional dielectric cavities such as photonic crystals [10 – 12], microdisks [13 – 15], nanowires [16 – 18] and <b>metal-cladding</b> cavities [19 – 22] are limited by wavelength. The resonant wavelengths of the surface-plasmon-polaritons (SPPs) excited at the dielectric-metal interface can be shorter than the wavelengths in dielectric cavities. Therefore, SPPs can be confined in a subwavelength volume. Various high-quality (Q) plasmonic cavities were successfully demonstrated by reducing metallic absorption [8], and provided strong optical feedback for lasing {{as well as an}} accessible collection of light emission [3, 4]. Lasing using plasmonic cavities could be a significant step toward an ultimate miniaturized coherent light source for nano-scale photonic integrated circuits. In this review paper, we will introduce four recently reported high-Q plasmonic cavities for strong SPP confinement and theoretically investigate their optical properties using three-dimensional (3 D) finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods.|$|R

The introduction of the <b>metal-clad</b> steel-frame brick-firewall storage warehouse with multiple sections under one roof, rippled throughout Lexington's burley storage landscape.
