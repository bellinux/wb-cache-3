5|$|Arachnids lack some {{features}} of other chelicerates, including backward-pointing <b>mouths</b> and gnathobases ("jaw bases") at {{the bases of}} their legs; both of these features {{are part of the}} ancestral arthropod feeding system. Instead, they have <b>mouths</b> that point forwards and downwards, and all have some means of breathing air. Spiders (Araneae) are distinguished from other arachnid groups by several characteristics, including spinnerets and, in males, pedipalps that are specially adapted for sperm transfer.|$|E

5|$|In colonial corals, growth {{results from}} the budding of new polyps. There {{are two types of}} budding, intratentacular and extratentacular. In intratentacular budding, a new polyp {{develops}} on the oral disc, inside the ring of tentacles. This can form individual, separate polyps or a row of partially separated polyps sharing an elongate oral disc with a series of <b>mouths.</b> Tentacles grow around the margin of this elongated oral disc and not around the individual <b>mouths.</b> This is surrounded by a single corallite wall, {{as is the case in}} the meandroid corallites of brain corals.|$|E

50|$|Burning <b>mouth</b> {{syndrome}} (BMS) is {{a burning}} sensation in the <b>mouth</b> with no underlying dental or medical cause. No related signs of disease {{are found in}} the <b>mouth.</b> People with burning <b>mouth</b> syndrome may also have a dry <b>mouth</b> sensation where no cause can be found such as reduced salivary flow, tingling in the <b>mouth,</b> or an altered taste or smell.|$|R
5|$|Rorquals use throat pleats {{to expand}} their <b>mouths,</b> which allow them to feed more effectively. However, {{rorquals}} need to build up water pressure in order {{to expand their}} <b>mouths,</b> leading to a lunge-feeding behavior. Lunge-feeding is where a whale rams a bait ball (a swarm of small fish) at high speed. Rorquals generally have streamlined physiques to reduce drag in the water while doing this.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after waking, red pandas clean their fur {{somewhat}} {{like a cat}} would, licking their front paws and then rubbing their backs, torsos, and sides. They also rub their backs and bellies {{along the sides of}} trees or rocks. Then they patrol their territories, marking with urine and a weak musk-smelling secretion from their anal glands. They search for food running along the ground or through the trees. Red pandas may use their forepaws alternately to bring food to their <b>mouths</b> or place food directly into their <b>mouths.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some turbellarians have {{a simple}} pharynx lined with cilia and {{generally}} feed by using cilia to sweep food particles and small prey into their <b>mouths,</b> which are usually {{in the middle of}} their undersides. Most other turbellarians have a pharynx that is eversible (can be extended by being turned inside-out), and the <b>mouths</b> of different species can be anywhere along the underside. The freshwater species Microstomum caudatum can open its mouth almost as wide as its body is long, to swallow prey about as large as itself.|$|E

50|$|A monkey <b>mouth,</b> sow <b>mouth,</b> or bulldog <b>mouth</b> is an underbite, {{where the}} lower jaw extends further out than the upper jaw. This is less common than parrot <b>mouth.</b> This {{can affect the}} horse's ability to graze. Monkey <b>mouth</b> is common and can be managed with regular teeth {{floating}} by a veterinarian.|$|R
5|$|When {{they are}} newly hatched, frog larvae {{feed on the}} yolk of the egg. When this is {{exhausted}} some move on to feed on bacteria, algal crusts, detritus and raspings from submerged plants. Water is drawn in through their <b>mouths,</b> which are usually {{at the bottom of}} their heads, and passes through branchial food traps between their <b>mouths</b> and their gills where fine particles are trapped in mucus and filtered out. Others have specialised mouthparts consisting of a horny beak edged by several rows of labial teeth. They scrape and bite food of many kinds as well as stirring up the bottom sediment, filtering out larger particles with the papillae around their <b>mouths.</b> Some, such as the spadefoot toads, have strong biting jaws and are carnivorous or even cannibalistic.|$|E
5|$|After Jyoti Singh's {{death on}} 29 December 2012, protests were staged all over India, {{including}} Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram, Mumbai, Bhubaneswar and Visakhapatnam.

5|$|Double-dipping {{involves}} {{taking a}} bite of a chip and then re-dipping it into a dip, which some people disapprove, while others are indifferent. Double-dipping transfers bacteria from a person's mouth into a dip, which can then be transferred to other consumer's <b>mouths.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{marine and}} {{freshwater}} environments, gastrotrichs {{form part of}} the benthic community. They are detritivores and are microphagous, sucking dead or living organic material, diatoms, bacteria and small protozoa into their <b>mouths</b> by the muscular action of the pharynx. They are themselves eaten by turbellarians and other small macrofauna.|$|E

5|$|Over 90% of the sicklefin lemon shark's diet {{consists}} of bottom- and shore-dwelling teleosts, including herring, mullets, mackerel, silversides, needlefish, smelt-whitings, porgies, sea catfish, triggerfish, parrotfish, and porcupinefish. Occasionally, {{they may also}} take cephalopods and crustaceans, and older individuals {{have been known to}} consume stingrays and guitarfish. This species may be preyed upon by larger sharks. Known parasites include the tapeworms Paraorygmatobothrium arnoldi, Pseudogrillotia spratti, Phoreiobothrium perilocrocodilus, and Platybothrium jondoeorum. Sicklefin lemon sharks have been documented resting on the bottom and eliciting cleanings by bluestreak cleaner wrasses (Labroides dimidiatus), during which they may open their <b>mouths</b> and stop respiring for as long as 150 seconds to give the wrasses access to their <b>mouths</b> and gills.|$|E
5|$|Since cats lack lips {{to create}} suction, {{they use a}} lapping method with the tongue to draw liquid upwards into their <b>mouths.</b> Lapping {{at a rate of}} four times a second, the cat touches the smooth tip of its tongue {{to the surface of the}} water, and quickly retracts it, drawing water upwards.|$|E
5|$|Some seabedâ€“dwelling {{species are}} highly {{effective}} ambush predators. Angel sharks and wobbegongs use camouflage {{to lie in}} wait and suck prey into their <b>mouths.</b> Many benthic sharks feed solely on crustaceans which they crush with their flat molariform teeth.|$|E

50|$|The name Kimsquit is {{associated}} with a former Nuxalk village at the <b>mouth</b> of the Dean River, just to the southeast of the <b>mouth</b> of the Kimsquit River. It is also the namesake of Kimsquit Peak, which is east of the <b>mouth</b> of the Kimsquit River and immediately north of the <b>mouth</b> of the Dean, and of Kimsquit Ridge, which is alongside the Kimsquit River on its west side a few miles upstream from its <b>mouth.</b> Comet Mountain is immediately southwest of the <b>mouth</b> of the Kimsquit.|$|R
5|$|The tiger {{salamander}} (Ambystoma tigrinum) {{is typical of}} the frogs and salamanders that hide under cover ready to ambush unwary invertebrates. Others amphibians, such as the Bufo spp. toads, actively search for prey, while the Argentine horned frog (Ceratophrys ornata) lures inquisitive prey closer by raising its hind feet over its back and vibrating its yellow toes. Among leaf litter frogs in Panama, frogs that actively hunt prey have narrow <b>mouths</b> and are slim, often brightly coloured and toxic, while ambushers have wide <b>mouths</b> and are broad and well-camouflaged. Caecilians do not flick their tongues, but catch their prey by grabbing it with their slightly backward-pointing teeth. The struggles of the prey and further jaw movements work it inwards and the caecilian usually retreats into its burrow. The subdued prey is gulped down whole.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{this ability}} to digest food outside the body, starfish can hunt prey much larger than their <b>mouths.</b> Their diets include clams and oysters, arthropods, small fish and {{gastropod}} molluscs. Some starfish are not pure carnivores, supplementing their diets with algae or organic detritus. Some of these species are grazers, but others trap food particles from the water in sticky mucus strands that are swept towards the mouth along ciliated grooves.|$|E
5|$|Cestodes have no <b>mouths</b> or guts, and the syncitial skin absorbs {{nutrients}} â€“ mainly {{carbohydrates and}} amino acids â€“ from the host, and also disguises it chemically to avoid attacks by the host's immune system. Shortage of carbohydrates in the host's diet stunts {{the growth of}} the parasites and kills some. Their metabolisms generally use simple but inefficient chemical processes, and they compensate by consuming large amounts of food relative to their size.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{takes as}} its core {{problematic}} {{the extent to}} which the <b>mouth</b> has been constituted as a theme for sociology. The aim this paper is to review existing perspectives on the <b>mouth</b> and evaluate the possibilities for further work on the <b>mouth</b> as an object of enquiry. The paper begins by exploring the <b>mouth</b> as a metaphor before going on to explore how the <b>mouth</b> became separated from the body through the techniques of power and knowledge associated with dentistry. We then explore how the <b>mouth</b> has become recognised as a symbol of oneâ€™s citizenship status. How the <b>mouth</b> has been evaluated through the perspective of historical anthropology is then studied, especially in relation to its function as a permeable boundary. The paper concludes by exploring further possibilities for work on the <b>mouth</b> specifically in relation to embodiment and the production of the <b>mouth</b> in social space...|$|R
