40|$|Trusts {{can be an}} {{effective}} mechanism for the <b>mitigation</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> liability. Settlors wishing to use them for this purpose need to navigate complex statutory regimes, and {{it is no surprise that}} mistakes are sometimes made. When there has been a tax planning error, the settlor (and other affected parties, such as beneficiaries) may have a number of options, including variation, rescission and professional negligence claims. However, it has become increasingly common to seek rectification of the trust deed and, as we will see, courts have been willing to grant the remedy in several recent decisions. This article takes a critical approach to these cases, and suggests that it is becoming too easy to obtain rectification for tax planning errors. The article begins by describing the traditional scope of the remedy, before turning to its recent usage in the tax context...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a {{proposal}} for <b>mitigation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tax</b> risk under the responsibility of Brazilian accounting offices. The increase in tax risk is brought mainly by advances in fiscal intelligence, represented by the comprehensiveness of provided supplementary information and consequently the increased power of detection by the tax Administration. This falls upon the responsibility of the accountant, as tax adviser, according to Brazilian law. Thus, preventative and tax-risk mitigation measures are required. A series <b>of</b> interviews with <b>tax</b> professionals, including accountants and tax advisers, accounting firm owners, and tax experts, detailed the activities performed by accounting offices in their tax advisory functions, including typical risks for each activity and a set <b>of</b> <b>mitigation</b> measures for risk management. We used the Delphi Method, since such an approach was not found in the literature. The proposal of this paper, and its main contribution, is the presentation of a table with risks and mitigation measures suggested by tax experts, as guidelines for risk management. Accounting offices are the main users of this proposal, but it can be extended to all professionals involved in tax advisory activities...|$|R
40|$|As {{the most}} {{efficient}} market-based mitigation instrument, carbon tax is highly recommended by economists and international organizations. Countries like Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Netherlands and Norway were the first adopters <b>of</b> carbon <b>tax</b> and as such, research on the impacts and problems <b>of</b> carbon <b>tax</b> implementation in these countries will provide great practical significance as well as caution for countries that are to levy the tax. Different from the existing studies that adopt the model simulation approaches, in this article, we comprehensively estimate the real <b>mitigation</b> effects <b>of</b> the five north European countries by employing the method of difference-in-difference (DID). The results indicate that carbon tax in Finland imposes a significant and {{negative impact on the}} growth of its per capita CO 2 emissions. Meanwhile, the effects <b>of</b> carbon <b>tax</b> in Denmark, Sweden and Netherlands are negative but not significant. The <b>mitigation</b> effects <b>of</b> carbon <b>tax</b> are weakened due to the tax exemption policies on certain energy intensive industries in these countries. Notwithstanding, in Norway, as the rapid growth of energy products drives a substantial increase of CO 2 emissions in oil drilling and natural gas exploitation sectors, carbon tax actually has not realized its mitigation effects.
