5|$|By October 11, {{investigators}} had conducted 124 interviews and had found 174 {{pieces of evidence}} related to the case. They were also investigating the West Nickel Mines School shooting in Pennsylvania, which had occurred {{five days after the}} shooting in Bailey. As a result of the September 27 incident, Platte Canyon High School increased its security, leaving only one school entrance unlocked. It plans to install <b>more</b> <b>security</b> cameras. Park County Sheriff Fred Wegener proposed having a guard there during the school day, but he stated that that particular suggestion was outside the current budget.|$|E
5|$|Dunster {{had become}} a centre for woollen and {{clothing}} production by the 13th century, with the market dating back to at least 1222, and {{a particular kind of}} kersey or broadcloth became known as 'Dunsters'. The prosperity of Dunster was based on the wool trade, with profits helping to pay for the construction of the tower of the Priory Church of St George and provide other amenities. By the 15th century the importance of the town was declining particularly due to the silting up of the harbour. The Luttrell's wanted to maintain the importance as a market and in 1609 George Luttrell, of the Luttrell family constructed the market to shelter traders and their wares from the rain and provide <b>more</b> <b>security</b> for their wares. The exact date of construction is debated and a variety of dates are given in different sources, however 1609 is considered the most likely.|$|E

50|$|A stapled {{security}} {{is a type of}} financial instrument. It consists of two or <b>more</b> <b>securities</b> that are contractually bound to form a single salable unit; they cannot be bought or sold separately. Stapled securities have especially been used in Australia; stapling is relatively uncommon {{in the rest of the}} world.|$|R

25|$|After the {{incident}} took place, numerous security measures were taken. The FAA released a security notice on January 6, {{the day after}} {{the incident}}. The notice included security of the aircraft and regulations pertaining to underaged flight students. In addition, the EAA and other smaller aircraft organizations proposed <b>more</b> <b>security</b> of flight schools and small aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Also, the IRS spent a {{total of}} USD $32.3 million to improve IRS {{building}} security across the United States, with USD $30.5 million for <b>more</b> <b>security</b> guards. The IRS said, because of the 2010 Austin terrorist attack and the emergency plans in place, there was no direct budgetary impact on the IRS’s ability to provide taxpayer services or enforce tax laws.|$|E
5000|$|G&E has {{achieved}} <b>more</b> <b>securities</b> settlements {{in excess of}} $100 million than any other law firm in the United States.

50|$|A market-linked CD (MLCD) is also {{referred}} to as an equity-linked CD, market-indexed CD or simply an indexed CD as well. It is a specific type of certificate of deposit that is linked to the performance of one or <b>more</b> <b>securities</b> or market indexes, like the S&P 500. Additionally, the term length is usually much longer, with periods ranging over many years rather than several months.|$|R
50|$|Diversification {{refers to}} the number of {{different}} securities in a fund. A fund with <b>more</b> <b>securities</b> is said to be better diversified than a fund with smaller number of securities. Owning many securities reduces volatility by decreasing the impact of large price swings above or below the average return in a single security. A Wilshire 5000 index would be considered diversified, but a bio-tech ETF would not.|$|R
25|$|Before the October 22, 2005 game, {{with the}} Baylor Bears, season ticket holders {{received}} a letter from Boren which outlined new stadium security procedures, including restrictions on bags and purses brought into the stadium, <b>more</b> <b>security</b> cameras, and hand searches of belongings. Readmission to the stadium after exiting during the game or at half-time was prohibited except for medical emergencies.|$|E
25|$|Moving from never {{changing}} one's password {{to changing}} the password on every authenticate attempt (pass or fail attempts) only doubles {{the number of}} attempts the attacker must make on average before guessing the password in a brute force attack.

25|$|The Frontier Series is {{the seventh}} series of {{banknotes}} of the Canadian dollar {{released by the}} Bank of Canada. The polymer banknotes were designed to increase durability and to incorporate <b>more</b> <b>security</b> features over the preceding Canadian Journey Series. The notes feature images that focus on historic Canadian achievements and innovation. It is the first banknote series issued by the Bank of Canada printed on a material other than paper.|$|E
50|$|Customarily, {{people may}} also dishoard {{money from the}} past hoardings due to {{a higher rate of}} {{interest}}. Due to this higher interest rate, idle cash balances of the past become active balances at present. This means they are usable for investment. As well as <b>more</b> <b>securities</b> being purchased for the higher return available. Where as in if the interest rate is low, dishoarding would be negligible.|$|R

50|$|The second main theme {{concerns}} the critical allocational role of securities markets. Previous research suggested that an efficient {{allocation of resources}} would require markets for far <b>more</b> <b>securities</b> than actually exist. Huang's work shifted the focus of discussion {{from the number of}} markets to the nature of dynamic trading opportunities. He showed that an efficient allocation of resources could in fact be obtained with relatively few securities as long as these securities could be traded continuously.|$|R
25|$|In group theory, {{a branch}} of mathematics, the baby-step giant-step is a meet-in-the-middle {{algorithm}} for computing the discrete logarithm. The discrete log problem is of fundamental importance {{to the area of}} public key cryptography. Many of the most commonly used cryptography systems are {{based on the assumption that}} the discrete log is extremely difficult to compute; the more difficult it is, the <b>more</b> <b>security</b> it provides a data transfer. One way to increase the difficulty of the discrete log problem is to base the cryptosystem on a larger group.|$|E
25|$|Line KR {{officers}} did {{not want}} to immediately arrest all the KGB personnel identified by Ames and Hanssen because they {{did not want}} to draw the attention of the CIA and FBI (which it did). They wanted to run a game of disinformation. But Washington Resident Stanislav Androsov wished to demonstrate his office's effectiveness to his superiors and ordered the immediate arrest of all who helped the CIA and FBI. After those incidents, the security of residencies was increased and the Line KR was assigned <b>more</b> <b>security</b> officers, especially in countries like the US and England.|$|E
25|$|The old mercantile and {{industrial}} elite, with their relative sophistication {{in matters of}} industry, trade and financing, were well poised to expand under British rule, using their own financing for new technology, represented by British machinery. Instead {{of just a few}} merchants introducing new industrial machinery, as elsewhere in India, in Ahmedabad the mercantile class as a whole supported the new techniques, even though hand spinners and handloom weavers, as well as female spinners in the outlying communities had their traditional operations upset as a result. They and others were recruited into the new manufacturing plants. The merchant class tended to support the British, thinking the rule provided <b>more</b> <b>security</b> than under the Marathas, lower taxes (including lower octroi), and more property rights.|$|E

50|$|Merrill Lynch {{settled with}} Orange County, California, {{for a massive}} $400 million to settle accusations that it sold {{inappropriate}} and risky investments to former county treasurer Robert Citron. Citron lost $1.69 billion, which forced the county to file for bankruptcy in December 1994. The county sued a dozen or <b>more</b> <b>securities</b> companies, advisors and accountants, but Merrill settled without admitting liability in June 1998. The county was able to recover about $600 million in total, including the $400 million from Merrill.|$|R
25|$|On November 30, 2011, Libyan ex-police {{and revolutionary}} Samir Salem Ali Elmadhavri, {{apparently}} copying {{the act of}} Norwegian extremist Anders Behring Breivik, attempted to massacre hundreds of tourists visiting the Palace in the early hours. Stopped at the Bab-i Humayun entrance by the Palace Guards, he opened fire on soldiers and security guards, injuring Private Şerafettin Eray Topçu and security guard Mehmet Ballıcı. After that he entered the main courtyard of the palace but was forced to retreat and search shelter in the entrance by Palace Guard force. After a gunfight lasting over one hour {{he was killed by}} Turkish Police SWAT teams. The incident sparked discussions about Palace security, because a foreigner was able to enter the Palace in broad daylight, during working hours, while carrying two hunting rifles. <b>More</b> <b>security</b> measures were put in place at the Palace entrance the day after the incident.|$|E
25|$|Despite Advani's arrest, the kar sevaks or activists {{accompanying}} the yatra continued on towards Ayodhya. Mulayam Singh Yadav, the Chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, ordered {{the arrest of}} all activists bound to Ayodhya, and 150,000 individuals were jailed. However, {{a large number of}} activists succeeded in reaching Ayodhya. Guha estimates this number at 75,000, while Christophe Jaffrelot states that it was 40,000. The town also held 20,000 security personnel, brought there by the state government. On 30 October a large number of activists pushed past the cordon of security officers, and moved towards the Babri Masjid. Although they were intercepted by <b>more</b> <b>security</b> forces, they succeeded in avoiding these, and reached the mosque. There, one volunteer placed a saffron flag on top of the mosque, while other activists attempted to tear the building down using tools like axes and hammers. The security personnel responded by initially using tear gas to expel the kar sevaks, and later using actual ammunition. The kar sevaks were pushed away from the mosque, but a pitched battle with security followed, which lasted three days, and led to the death of 20 VHP volunteers.|$|E
25|$|The CNDH {{suggested}} after Bermúdez Zacarías' {{murder to}} create a policy to have judges handle cases anonymously {{in order to protect}} their identity. They argued that by having this policy in place, judges would be able to preside over cases impartially and without being intimidated. This method was used in Peru, Colombia, and Italy to protect judges who faced threats from armed groups. The Mexican government stated that they would debate and consider the proposal as an option, but said that accepting the policy would mean that they were giving in to the pressures from organized crime. Moreover, the 2016 judicial reform – the New Criminal Justice System (Spanish: Nuevo Sistema de Justicia Penal, NSJP) – advocated for greater judicial transparency, a move that was seen at odds with the proposed policy. When Bermúdez Zacarías was murdered, only 70 out of 1,391 federal judges had security measures in place to protect them from attacks. Several judges advocated for <b>more</b> <b>security</b> measures, but this also posed several challenges because of the limited resources and long processes that would need to take place for such budgets to be approved by politicians. Local judges, however, do not enjoy the level of protection that their federal counterparts have, and attacks from organized crime members are more prevalent. In addition, most of the cases involving attacks or intimidation against judges are not reported to the police. If the cases are filed to the police, many of them do not reach a court of law and are closed without imparting justice.|$|E

500|$|The U.S. blamed Syria's Assad {{government}} for intentionally delaying efforts to remove chemical arms {{from the country}} for destruction, suggesting {{that the goal of}} liquidating the arsenal by midyear is in jeopardy. Stating that Assad is, in effect, slow-walking the chemicals in order to obtain <b>more</b> <b>security</b> equipment, U.S. Ambassador Robert P.

500|$|Bahadur was {{satisfied}} with the decision, [...] "Out of seven accused, five have been given death sentences.

[...] However, he was disappointed that [...] "the leader [...] got away with death penalty because he intentionally disappeared during the killing." [...] Narendra said, [...] "We will appeal in High Court for death penalty to the main accused, Ganga Raj. We respect the court's decision but he should be punished so that the instigators of the crime get the punishment. Also it is important that it is a very clear message so that no khap gives such directions, ever." [...] Seema seconded Narendra's concerns, [...] "We would have been happier if the main accused was also given the death sentence. The decision of the panchayat was not justified and people should not to be allowed to misuse their power. We have fought this battle alone when no one was supporting us."

500|$|Bradley {{called the}} militia to Frankfort to {{maintain}} order, and considered adjourning the session to an opera house in Louisville where <b>more</b> <b>security</b> could be provided. Some leading Democrats in Louisville lauded Bradley for preserving order, but Democratic lawmakers in the Senate sought {{the passage of}} resolutions to convict Bradley of interference with the election, fine him $500, and sentence him to six months in jail. These same legislators also threatened to imprison Lieutenant Governor William Jackson Worthington, allowing Democratic President pro tem of the Senate William Goebel to become acting governor. A committee was appointed to investigate Bradley, but the resolutions to convict and imprison him were not passed. On March 16, Governor Bradley declared martial law in the capital. The session adjourned later that day without having elected a senator. Among the session's few accomplishments were bills creating two reform houses {{in the state and}} providing for free turnpikes and gravel roads. A bill forbidding the employment of children of school age who had not attended at least twelve weeks of school during the year passed over Bradley's veto. In an effort to embarrass the governor, the Senate refused to pass a revenue bill, leaving the governor with no money to run the state. Following the session, a Northern Kentucky newspaper opined [...] "It is hard to conceive how a legislature would go about accomplishing less than this present one has." ...|$|E
