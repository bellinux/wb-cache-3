Despite being a monoecious species and prone to floral polygamy, Ilex guayusa appears to yield little fertile material, so it relies mostly on asexual reproduction (basal shoots, sprouts and suckers).

50|$|Haptotaxis {{plays a role}} in {{organizing}} cells to form tissues and specific regions of those tissues. Fibronectin and laminin both play a role in adrenocyte mutation into distinctive distribution in the adrenal gland. The adrenocytes migrate centripetally as they mature towards the medulla of the adrenal gland., and this movement may be a result of haptotactic forces mediated by fibronectin and laminin. In nerve cells, axonal growth is mediated by nerve growth factor in a haptotactic manner, where the axon of nerve cells grows along the gradient. This information could be used to possibly develop methods to promote nerve regeneration in patients that have nerve damage. Another regenerative strategy is the use of mesenchymal stem cells, which can differentiate into different kinds of connective tissue in the wound healing process. The haptotaxis is mediated by fibronectin, vitronectin, and type I collagen. A recent study has tentatively proposed the idea that the structures on cells responsible for sensing the membrane protein gradients are attenuated filopodia. Also, the <b>more</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> filopodia present on {{the leading edge of the}} migrating cell, the more responsive the cell is to the haptotactic gradient. This is important because there is the possibility that all motile cells that display filopodia may be responding to haptotactic gradients. Further research is required in the subject, but it is clear that more and more kinds of cell undergo haptotaxis than originally believed.|$|E

30|$|In this article, a new Bose-Chaudhuri-Hochquenghem (BCH)-based {{data hiding}} scheme for JPEG {{steganography}} is presented. Traditional data hiding approaches hide data into each block, {{where all the}} blocks are not overlapping each other. However, in the proposed method, two consecutive blocks can be overlapped to form a combined block which is larger than a single block, but smaller than two consecutive nonoverlapping blocks in size. In order to embed <b>more</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> data into the combined block than a single block, the BCH-based data hiding scheme has to be redesigned. In this article, we propose {{a way to get}} a joint solution for hiding data into two blocks with intersected coefficients such that any modification of the intersected area does not affect the data hiding process into both blocks. Due to hiding <b>more</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> data into the intersected area, embedding capacity is increased. On the other hand, the nonzero DCT coefficient stream is modified to achieve better steganalysis and to reduce the distortion impact after data hiding. This approach carefully inserts or removes 1 or - 1 coefficients into or from the DCT coefficient stream according to the rule proposed in this article. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms work well and their performance is significant.|$|R
