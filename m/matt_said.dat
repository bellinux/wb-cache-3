In the episode, a robot examines the health of Maggie's fetus. Maggie's band is present, and one of the band members presses a button on the robot's [...] "face", which is a screen showing its facial expressions, and a soccer game comes on instead. A sports commentator, voiced by Groening, gives a long [...] "goal!" [...] shout that is heard over the game. According to The Simpsons music editor Chris Ledesma, as the episode was being recorded, [...] "there were only sounds of crowd cheering during that shot and <b>Matt</b> <b>said</b> we needed to spice it up somehow." [...] After going through some different ideas, the staff settled on a commentator shouting [...] "goal!".

2500|$|The site grew {{slowly at}} first, and {{primarily}} through word-of-mouth. They {{were able to}} sell a [...] "few dozen" [...] T-shirts by 2001. Mike moved back to New York in mid-2001 and he and Matt started crafting the first Strong Bad Email some kinda robot, intending {{this to be a}} weekly feature. The Strong Bad Email series proved very popular, generating significant interest in the site; when the brothers were late in publishing a new Strong Bad Email, they received angry emails asking where the new short was, which <b>Matt</b> <b>said</b> was [...] "a cool feeling to know you're as important as a cup of coffee or morning crossword to some folks". Their father suggested Matt quit his full-time time job to devote time to creating more Homestar Runner shorts. With the number of visitors to the site growing, by January 2003 the site had outgrown its original web host, Yahoo!. Merchandise sales paid for all of the costs of running the website as well as living costs of the creators, whose retired parents managed many of the business aspects.|$|E

The song's chorus is Matt shouting “Let's go let's go let's go let's go!” Allmusic {{said that the}} song [...] "cuts the tempo {{in favor of an}} almost funky late-'90s groove." [...] "Now" [...] was described by Popmatters as a combination of [...] "a style of music outside of the duo's usual comfort zone [...] " [...] with the group's usual musical style. [...] "It's Alright" [...] includes percussion of a kick drum and tambourine, and was considered by Consequence of Sound as a dance-jazz song. <b>Matt</b> <b>said</b> it was one of his favorite songs. [...] "Not That Bad" [...] has instrumentation of martial drums, piano plinks, and a synth brass section. According to Popmatters, when the [...] "synth brass section comes in and the tempo slows down for the chorus, it feels like something big is coming." [...] "Overexposed" [...] is instrumentated with a quick-moving wobbly right-hand synth, keyboard, bass guitar, kickdrum and hi-hat. The song's Pre-Chorus is “Like a picture / I was overexposed / Be-lieve me / I saw you with my eyes closed,” and the vocals during the chorus are in unison with the keyboard.|$|E
