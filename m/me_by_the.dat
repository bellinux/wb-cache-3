5|$|This {{beautiful}} species, {{which is}} sufficiently characterised to {{distinguish it from}} every other individual of the class, is copiously produced in Dutch Guiana, about 300 paces from the sea, and nearly {{as far from the}} left bank of the river of Surinam. It was communicated to <b>me</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> elder Vaillant, who discovered it in 1755 on some raised ground which was never overflowed by the highest tides, and is formed of a very fine white sand, covered with a thin stratum of earth. The prodigious quantity of individuals of this species which grow at the same time, the very different periods of their expansion, the brilliancy and the varied shades of their colours, present a prospect truly picturesque. The fungus was later placed in a new genus, Dictyophora, in 1809 by Nicaise Auguste Desvaux; it was then known for many years as Dictyophora indusiata. Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck placed the species in Hymenophallus in 1817, as H.indusiatus. Both genera were eventually returned to synonyms of Phallus and the species is now known again by its original name.|$|E

500|$|Eisenhower {{publicly}} stated {{his opposition}} in {{his press conference}} of March 26, 1953: [...] "The Bricker Amendment, as analyzed for <b>me</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Secretary of State, would, as I understand it, in certain ways restrict the authority that the President must have, {{if he is to}} conduct the foreign affairs of this Nation effectively[...] [...] [...] [...] I do believe that there are certain features that would work to the disadvantage of our country, particularly in making it impossible for the President to work with the flexibility that he needs in this highly complicated and difficult situation." [...] Eisenhower's phrasing, [...] "as analyzed for <b>me</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Secretary of State," [...] led Bricker and other conservatives to blame Dulles for misleading Eisenhower, and raised their suspicion that the Secretary of State was a tool of Eastern internationalist interests.|$|E

500|$|Although it was {{claimed that}} he was once engaged, Newton never married. The French writer and philosopher Voltaire, who was in London {{at the time of}} Newton's funeral, said that he [...] "was never {{sensible}} to any passion, was not subject to the common frailties of mankind, nor had any commerce with women—a circumstance which was assured <b>me</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> physician and surgeon who attended him in his last moments". The widespread belief that he died a virgin has been commented on by writers such as mathematician Charles Hutton, economist John Maynard Keynes, and physicist Carl Sagan.|$|E
500|$|The battle had {{significant}} effects within the Scots community of North Carolina, where Loyalists refused {{to turn out}} when calls to arms were made later in the war, and many were routed {{out of their homes}} by the pillaging activities of their Patriot neighbors. [...] Flora MacDonald ended up returning to her native Skye in 1779, and when General Charles Cornwallis passed through the Cross Creek area in 1781, he reported that [...] "any of the inhabitants rode into camp, shook <b>me</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hand, said they were glad to see us and that we had beat Greene and then rode home." ...|$|E

500|$|Auditions {{were held}} {{for the role of}} Becky which {{required}} the auditionee to look deliberately scruffy. Actress Katherine Kelly commented: [...] "I was told to turn up looking as crap as possible, with no make-up. But that morning I'd also been for an audition where I had to look really glamorous. So I sat on the Tube putting grease in my hair and wiping my make-up off with everyone looking at <b>me.</b> <b>By</b> <b>the</b> time I got there I looked a right state!". Kelly was initially only cast for a three-month period when she began filming in 2006, but impressed producers and was offered an extended contract as a regular character. On 17 June 2008, after further impressing the producers, Kelly was signed for an additional 12 months. In February 2009, Kelly again had her contract extended, securing her role in the soap until August 2011. However, in 2010 Kelly was signed to a new 18-month contract by new producer Phil Collinson, a contract which was described as [...] "unprecedented" [...] at the time.|$|E
500|$|The {{special effects}} were simple and {{limited by the}} budget. The {{on-screen}} blood was real in some cases, such as the scene in which Leatherface feeds [...] "Grandpa". The crew had difficulty getting the stage blood {{to come out of}} its tube, so instead Burns's index finger was cut with a razor. Burns's costume was so drenched with stage blood that it was [...] "virtually solid" [...] by the last day of shooting. The scene in which Leatherface decapitates Kirk with a chainsaw worried actor William Vail (Kirk). After telling Vail to stay still lest he really be killed, Hansen brought the running chainsaw to within [...] of Vail's face. A real hammer was used for the climactic scene at the end, with some takes also featuring a mock-up. However, the actor playing Grandpa was aiming for the floor rather than his victim's head. Still, the shoot was somewhat dangerous, with Hooper noting at the wrap party that all cast members had obtained some level of injury. He stated that [...] "everyone hated <b>me</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> end of the production" [...] and that [...] "it just took years for them to kind of cool off." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{award was}} {{presented}} to Green, who has received a total of eleven Grammy awards during his lifetime. In 1982, Green was presented the award for Best Soul Gospel Performance, Traditional for The Lord Will Make a Way, followed by awards for Best Soul Gospel Performance, Contemporary and Best Soul Gospel Performance, Traditional in 1983 for Higher Plane and Precious Lord, respectively. Green earned three awards for Best Soul Gospel Performance, Male: the first in 1984 for I'll Rise Again, another in 1987 for [...] "Going Away" [...] (from the album He Is the Light), and a third in 1988 for [...] "Everything's Gonna Be Alright" [...] (from the album Soul Survivor). The song [...] "Sailin' on the Sea of Your Love" [...] earned Shirley Caesar and Green the award for Best Soul Gospel Performance by a Duo or Group, Choir or Chorus in 1985. Green has earned three Grammy awards since his 1990 recognition for [...] "As Long as We're Together"; in 1995 he and Lyle Lovett earned the first Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals for [...] "Funny How Time Slips Away", and in 2009 he was presented awards for Best Traditional R Vocal Performance for [...] "You've Got the Love I Need" [...] and Best R Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for [...] "Stay with <b>Me</b> (<b>By</b> <b>the</b> Sea)". Of the other Best Soul Gospel Performance nominees for 1990, only Walker eventually earned a Grammy award (Best Traditional Soul Gospel Album in 1995 for Songs of the Church: Live in Memphis).|$|E

However, after Gallagher divorced Mathews in 2001, he said the song was not about Mathews: [...] "The meaning of that song was taken away from <b>me</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> media who jumped on it, {{and how do you}} tell your Mrs it's not about her once she's read it is? It's a song about an imaginary friend who's gonna come and save you from yourself".|$|E
2500|$|On December 23, 1863, {{while on}} {{deployment}} {{off the coast}} of Texas, Seyburn was ordered to proceed with the Kittatinny to New Orleans. [...] Shortly after his arrival, Seyburn submitted his resignation. [...] In his letter, dated February 18, 1864, from the station ship , Seyburn indicated that he wanted to resign because he had been crippled by his wound and because [...] "the high handed injustice practiced on <b>me</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Commanding officers of the first division of this Squadron is to me insufferable." [...] His resignation was accepted and Seyburn was honorably discharged on March 24, 1864 in Gardiner, Maine.|$|E

General Chatzipetros, showing military decorations declared [...] "These were given to <b>me</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> heroism and braveness of the Column of Cypriots".
