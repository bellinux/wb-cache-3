40|$|Service systems {{used for}} various {{applications}} in home automation and security require estimating the locations precisely using certain sensors. Serving a mobile user automati-cally by sensing his/her locations in an indoor environment is {{considered as a}} challenge. However, indoor localization cannot be carried out effectively using the Global Posi-tioning System (GPS). In recent years, the use of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in locating a mobile object in an indoor environment has become popular. Some physical features have also been discussed to solve localization in WSNs. In this paper, we inquire into received signal strength indication (RSSI) -based solutions and propose a new local-ization scheme called the closer tracking algorithm (CTA) for indoor localization. Under the proposed CTA, a mechanism on mode-change is designed to switch automatically between the optimal approximately closer approach (ACA) and the real-time tracking (RTT) method according to pre-tuned thresholds. Furthermore, we design a mecha-nism to <b>move</b> <b>reference</b> nodes dynamically to reduce the uncovered area of the ACA for increasing the estimation accuracy.

With special long and narrow geographical location in the area, designing and building monitoring network was vital to the realization of landslide monitoring. To build such a network with high precision, this paper mainly focused on the following four aspects: (1) method of using multiple GPS reference stations to build a unified datum network and subnet adjustment, (2) GPS data processing algorithm with millimeter level, (3) analysis of influence on the adjustment resulting from systematic error of time evolution datum from different GPS observations, and (4) establishment and stability analysis of unified datum. Then, using global test and trial-and-error method to analyze the datum based on the GPS observations (2008 ~ 2011) of landslide monitoring network in the area, we concluded that there were <b>moved</b> <b>reference</b> points during the three years of high water impoundment, and the horizontal displacement of <b>moved</b> <b>reference</b> points was more than 4 [*]cm, even up to 79. 4 [*]cm.

40|$|Unification of couplings, {{observation}} of neutrino masses {{in the expected}} range, and several other considerations confirm central implications of straightforward gauge unification based on SO(10) or a close relative and incorporating low-energy supersymmetry. The remaining outstanding consequence of this circle of ideas, yet to be observed, is nucleon instability. Clearly, we should aspire to be as specific as possible regarding the rate and form of such instability. I argue that not only esthetics, but also the observed precision of unification of couplings, favors an economical symmetry-breaking (Higgs) structure. Assuming this, one can exploit its constraints to build reasonably economical, overconstrained yet phenomenologically viable models of quark and lepton masses. Putting it all together, one arrives at reasonably concrete, hopeful expectations regarding nucleon decay. These expectations are neither ruled out by existing experiments, nor hopelessly inaccessible.

40|$|The Institute of Flight Systems of the German Aerospace Center {{uses and}} {{develops}} a high resolution comprehensive simulation tool called S 4 for the computation of isolated helicopter rotors. The aerodynamic calculation {{is based on}} blade element theory and employs advanced models for the sectional air loads. S 4 uses a modal synthesis approach for a one-dimensional, pre-twisted beam to calculate the blade motion. New and advanced blade designs cannot be represented by simple linear beam approaches with sufficient accuracy especially when large deformations occur. Modern multibody systems offer the potential to remedy that deficit by incorporating high-fidelity finite state models of rotor blades and provide implicit facilities to simulate <b>moved</b> <b>reference</b> frames and complex kinematics of entire rotor systems including the hub and control system. This paper describes the work to establish and verify a tight coupling between the rotor simulation S 4 and the multibody system SIMPACK.

The coupling architecture is explained in detail and differences between both approaches are discussed.

40|$|The flow {{around a}} marine {{propeller}} is studied {{by means of}} a RANS-type finite-volume (FV) method. A performance curve in open-water conditions is reproduced computationally and compared to data measured in a cavitation tunnel at Rolls-Royce in Kristinehamn, Sweden. In the computations, both periodic grids with a single propeller blade and grids featuring a full propeller with five blades are used. Two types of full propeller grids are applied. The first one consists of tetrahedral control volumes with prismatic layers near the propeller surface. The second grid type is a hybrid mesh that is a combination of separately meshed hexahedral and tetrahedral grids with an Arbitrary Mesh Interface (AMI) between the two parts. Turbulence is modelled by the two-equation SST k-! model as implemented in OpenFOAM. In steady-state computations, the <b>Moving</b> <b>Reference</b> Frame (MRF) approach is applied to account for the e↵ects due to rotation. In case of transient simulations, moving meshes with the sliding plane approach are utilized and the e↵ect of both numerical and iterative errors due to temporal discretization are studied. This study provides a solid basis for more complicated simulations by providing an understanding of errors caused by grid interfaces and the choice of spatial and temporal discretizations of the governing equations. In particular, the experiences with the AMI methodology will allow the analysis of contra-rotating propellers (CRP) with OpenFOAM. In addition, the robustness of the numerical method is considered {{in order to be able}} to produce a usable tool for industrial use...|$|R

40|$|A {{practical}} {{engineering approach}} {{to the design of}} a 60 kW wind generator with improved performances is presented. The proposed approach relies on the use of a specific, ``ad hoc'' developed software, OPTIWR (Optimization Software), expressly conceived to define an ``optimum'' rotor configuration in the framework of the blade-element-momentum theory. Starting from an initial input geometric configuration (corresponding to an already existing 50 kW turbine) and for given values of the wind velocity VwindVwind and of the advance ratio X=Vwind/ΩRX=Vwind/ΩR (where ΩΩ is the blade rotational speed and $R$ is the propeller radius), this software is used to determine iteratively the optimized distributions of chords and twists which can guarantee a constant value of the socalled axial induction factor a=a= 1 / 3 along the blade. The output configuration is then converted into a CAD model to be used, in turn, as input data for a CFD commercial software. With this tool the relative rotational motion between the fluid and the wind turbine simulated resorting to a MRF (<b>Moving</b> <b>Reference</b> Frame) technique (for which continuity and momentum equations are solved in a rotating reference frame). The outcomes of the numerical simulations are then used to verify the improved performances of the optimized configuration and to which extent the CFD data agree with ``expected'' behaviours (i. e. performances predicted {{on the basis of the}} simplified model). Finally, some details about the construction technique used to turn the optimized configuration into an effective working prototype are provided, in conjunction with a critical discussion of suitable production methods for composite components...|$|R

40|$|Turbocharging the {{internal}} combustion engine {{is one of the most}} effective ways to reduce the fuel consumption and fulll the green house gas emissions requierements. Nevertheless, this techinque has some limitations that need to be addressed in order to improve the turbocharger performance. The range of use of the compressor is restricted by the surgeline at low massow rates and the choke line at high massow rates. The compressor map gives valuable information of the compressor stable operating points. However, due to the space constraints in an engine compartiment, complex pipes are needed to integrate all the components correctly leading to a dierence in the compressor preformance from measurments to in-situ congurations. Computational Fluid Dynamics is a powerful tool to predict compressor maps in a shorter time and less laborious way compared to experimental measurements and obtaining data in the whole domain. The compressor map of a turbocharger compressor was calculated using a steady-state RANS approach and the <b>Moving</b> <b>Reference</b> Frames technique to handle the rotating parts of the machine, validating the method with experimental data.
