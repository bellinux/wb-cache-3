[...] With regards to Schengen Agreement signatory states, Macau SAR passport holders are also permitted to undertake a paid activity (i.e. work) visa-free for a maximum of 90 days within a 180-day period in Belgium, Denmark, Iceland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia and Sweden — though not in Portugal.

However, this 8 day (in a calendar year) visa exemption excludes gainful occupation in the primary or secondary construction industry, civil engineering, catering and hotel services, industrial and private cleaning industry, surveillance and security services and sex industry. Alternatively, if in possession of a long term residence permit issued by any other Schengen member state, the Macau SAR passport holder can exercise a gainful occupation for up to 3 months visa-free in Switzerland (without the industry-specific restrictions listed in the 8 day (in a calendar year) visa exemption). In Croatia (a European Union member state but not a Schengen signatory state), <b>Macao</b> <b>SAR</b> passport holders are permitted to undertake a paid activity (i.e. work) visa-free for a maximum of 90 days within a 180-day period.|$|E

50|$|At present, {{although}} {{citizens of}} Argentina, Brazil, Israel, holders of Hong Kong SAR passports and <b>Macao</b> <b>SAR</b> passports {{are able to}} visit and/or study in the UK without a visa for up to 6 months, and although citizens of Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates with an EVW can visit and/or study in the UK without a visa for up to 6 months, if they decide to stay for more than 6 months and have been granted entry clearance permitting them to do so, {{they are required to}} register with the police at a cost of £34 within 7 days of arriving in the UK (or within 7 days of obtaining their visa if they apply within the UK). This suggests that citizens of these 8 countries and territories are considered to be higher-risk than other non-visa nationalities (who are not required to register with the police if they obtain a visa to stay in the UK for more than 6 months), although Argentina, Hong Kong, Oman, Qatar and the UAE are deemed to be 'low-risk' from a visa regime perspective for the purpose of Tier 4 student visa applications and appear in 'Appendix H' (see above).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{attributes}} and particularities of the <b>Macao</b> <b>SAR</b> Reserve Fund. The Fund is a one-off {{transfer to the}} <b>Macao</b> <b>SAR</b> upon its formation, and its primary role in the Macao economy is obviously {{different from that of}} foreign exchange reserve. In order to understand the alternate functions that could be undertaken by the Fund, some notable principles concerning the management of public funds, such as consideration of externalities, comparison of costs and benefits, as well as risk and macroeconomic goals, are reviewed. Notable experiences in the USA and Hong Kong SAR are also examined. On the basis of all evidences and references being presented, it is suggested that the principal of the Fund should be maintained as a minimum amount of fiscal reserves of the <b>Macao</b> <b>SAR.</b> In view of some puzzles which are currently restraining the recovery of the economy, it is also feasible to promote “public good ” by making use of the Fund to guarantee loans for properly-run small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as to support human capital investment. However, effective measures and procedures must be adopted to secure the principal of the Fund...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{explored}} {{the use of}} Importance-Performance Analysis in assessing the competitiveness of China’s Macao Special Administrative Region as a city for international conventions. Determinants of destination choice for convention tourists are grouped under three factors, namely the convention factor, the city factor and the tourism factor. Attributes of these three factors were studied through a survey with the convention participants and exhibitors of <b>Macao</b> <b>SAR.</b> Results indicate that the city boasts of strong traditional tourist attractions and infrastructure, but is deficient in specialized convention experts and promotion mechanisms. A reflection on the findings suggests that an urban city such as the <b>Macao</b> <b>SAR</b> can co-develop its the convention and the traditional tourism for a synergistic effect. With proper planning and co-ordination, both areas of the city’s tourism industry will grow as they feed off each other...|$|E
