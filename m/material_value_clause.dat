40|$|Defined <b>value</b> <b>clauses</b> used to <b>value</b> nonmarketable family limited {{partnership}} (FLP) interests create valuation distortions {{and other public}} policy issues. This paper describes these abuses and proposes the employment of restrictions similar to those applied to pecuniary formula marital deduction clauses. The article explains how pecuniary formula marital deduction provisions created valuation distortions by allowing for undervaluation of the marital share that were remedied by the IRS’s Rev. Proc. 64 - 19 and the enactment of section 2056 (b) (10). The article analyzes recent case law expanding the use of defined <b>value</b> <b>clauses</b> into the FLP area and criticizes the courts for not applying the public policy doctrines of Procter and Robinette to those cases. The article distinguishes defined valuation clauses in the FLP context and shows how all fixed <b>value</b> <b>clauses</b> are not equivalent. Finally, the article proposes solutions {{to deal with the}} valuation distortions that these clauses create...|$|R

This study examined demographic, personality, and individual difference predictors of willingness to buy counterfeit goods (WBCG) in a community sample of British adults. Two-hundred and thirty-seven participants completed a questionnaire that assessed their willingness to buy 19 types of counterfeit goods, attitudes towards counterfeiting, <b>material</b> <b>values,</b> Big Five personality traits, and demographics. Structural equation modelling showed that attitudes towards counterfeiting were the strongest predictors of WBCG. In addition, <b>material</b> <b>values</b> predicted both WBCG directly and indirectly through attitudes towards counterfeiting. Older participants showed lower WBCG, although this effect was moderated by participants' conscientiousness, <b>material</b> <b>values,</b> and attitudes towards counterfeiting.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{characterize}} three-dimensional, left-handed metamaterials (LHM) we use electromagnetic field simulations of unit cells. For waves traveling {{in one of}} the main directions of the periodic LHM-arrays, the analysis is concentrated on the calculation of global quantities of the unit cells, such as scattering parameters or dispersion dia-grams, and a careful interpretation of the results. We show that the concept of equivalent <b>material</b> <b>values</b> – which may be negative in a narrow frequency range – can be validated by large “global ” simulations of a wedge structure. We also discuss the limitations of this concept, since in some cases the macroscopic behavior of an LHM cannot be accurately described by equivalent <b>material</b> <b>values.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{purposes}} of this study are to classify consumption values and {{to examine the effects of}} consumption val-ues on appearance management behaviors. Questionnaires data was obtained through adults over 20 years old of age (N= 478) in Gyeonggi-do, Daegu and Kyungpook regions. Descriptive statistics, factor analysis, multiple regression anal-ysis, t-test and ANOVA were applied. The results of this study are as follows. First, consumption values are composed of three factors such as differential <b>value,</b> <b>material</b> <b>value</b> and practical value. Appearance management behaviors are iden-tified such as surgery/skin care, clothing care, weight training and hair care. The weight training in appearance man-agement behaviors is the most preferred behavior. Second, the results of regression analysis are like as follows: The effects of consumption on plastic surgery/skin care are explained by the differential <b>value,</b> <b>material</b> <b>value</b> and practical value(−). On weight training and hair care, the differential <b>value</b> and <b>material</b> <b>value</b> have positively significant effects. The differential value has significant effects on all over appearance management behaviors. Third, there are signigicant dif-ferences in consumption values and appearance management behaviors according to demographic variables. The single, females in 20 s and 30 s with higher monthly income and payment have higher differential value and lower practical value. The single and female in 20 s and 30 s were more involved in appearance management behavior.

40|$|Direct care worker {{turnover}} and shortages plague long-term care, weakening its quality, heightening {{costs for}} governments and employers, and cyclically breeding further turnover and shortages of workers. To address these issues, I investigate why direct care workers chose employment in long-term care (LTC), assisted living (AL) and specific AL facilities. Data {{come from a}} mixed-methods study of 45 AL facilities in Georgia, including interviews with 400 direct care workers. Findings include qualitative data analyzed using a grounded theory approach and descriptive quantitative data. Care workers’ motivations for employment in LTC, AL, and specific AL facilities reflect a split between moral and <b>material</b> <b>values</b> for care work, and care workers’ motivations illustrate a process of reconciling moral and <b>material</b> <b>values.</b> Individuals become care workers {{for reasons that are}} both materialistic, like earning a living wage, and moralistic, like the desire to care for others. They take employment expecting it to be consistent with their moral ideals and to satisfy their economic needs. Various individual, facility, industry, and community level factors influence workers’ motivations, and these factors reinforce the inconsistency between moral and <b>material</b> <b>values</b> for care work. Considering the heightening demand for LTC and short supply of care workers, as well as the deindustrialization of the economy, several recommendations are made for policies and practices that would support workers’ motivations for employment in LTC. Areas for future research also are highlighted...|$|R
