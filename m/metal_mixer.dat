40|$|A {{solar energy}} {{collector}} focuses solar energy onto a solar oven which {{is attached to a}} mixer which in turn is attached to the channel of a MHD generator. Gas enters the oven and a liquid <b>metal</b> enters the <b>mixer.</b> The gas/liquid <b>metal</b> mixture is heated by the collected solar energy and moves through the MHD generator thereby generating electrical power. The mixture is then separated and recycled...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{integrating}} liquid metal {{magnetohydrodynamic power generation}} with fusion blanket technology to produce electrical power from a thermonuclear fusion reactor located within a confining magnetic field and within a toroidal structure. A hot liquid metal flows from a liquid metal blanket region into a pump duct of an electromagnetic pump which moves the liquid <b>metal</b> to a <b>mixer</b> where a gas of predetermined pressure is mixed with the pressurized liquid metal to form a Froth mixture. Electrical power is generated by flowing the Froth mixture between electrodes in a generator duct. When the Froth mixture exits the generator the gas is separated from the liquid metal and both are recycled...|$|R
5000|$|A DJ mixer {{is a type}} {{of audio}} mixing console used by DJs for two {{different}} purposes: some DJs use the mixer to make seamless transitions from one song to another when they are spinning a set at a dance club. Hip hop DJs and turntablists use the DJ mixer to play record players like a musical instrument and create new sounds. DJs in the disco, house music, electronic dance music and other dance-oriented genres use the mixer to make smooth transitions between different sound recordings as they are playing. The sources are typically record turntables, compact cassettes, CDJs, or DJ software on a laptop. DJ mixers allow the DJ to use headphones to preview the next song before playing it to the audience. Most low- to mid-priced DJ mixers can only accommodate two turntables or CD players, but some mixers (such as the ones used in larger nightclubs) can accommodate up to four turntables or CD players. DJs and turntablists in hip hop music and nu <b>metal</b> use DJ <b>mixers</b> to create beats, loops and [...] "scratching" [...] sound effects.|$|R
