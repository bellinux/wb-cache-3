50|$|The second {{approach}} is to suppose that someone is told that one will have <b>memories</b> <b>erased</b> and then one will be tortured. Does one need {{to be afraid of}} being tortured? The intuition is that people will be afraid of being tortured, since it will still be one despite not having one's memories. Next, Williams asked one to consider several similar scenarios.Intuition is that in all the scenarios one is to be afraid of being tortured, that it is still one's self despite having one's <b>memories</b> <b>erased</b> and receiving new memories.

5000|$|As {{revealed}} in [...] "Thrill of the Hunt", Ratchet was assigned by Ultra Magnus to rescue an intelligence officer, Arcee, and retrieve access codes {{vital to the}} war effort, when he ran into a Decepticon bounty hunter, Lockdown. Lockdown captured both of them, and took Ratchet's EMP Generator as a trophy. Arcee requested that Ratchet use the generator at full blast to wipe her <b>memory,</b> <b>erasing</b> the access codes in the process. Ratchet did so, but Lockdown's interference overloaded it, completely erasing Arcee's memory. Attempting to restore her memory, Ratchet accidentally uploaded the access codes Arcee was carrying. When Highbrow notices this, he has Ultra Magnus bring Ratchet before the inactive Omega Supreme, with Ratchet taking Arcee's place in teaching Omega prior to being introduced to battle. But {{in the aftermath of}} war, with Arcee still in stasis and Omega's near death in the final fight, Ratchet became the bitter war veteran that he is today.|$|E

He lives with his three sisters, and has no idea that they are mahoutsukai (magic users). Haruo has latent magic powers, {{but he is not}} aware of this, believing he and his family are perfectly ordinary. His powers are revealed to be extraordinary on two occasions; when a ghost takes over his spirit and is able to channel extreme power through him and when Michiru kidnaps him during a school play and he becomes so angry at how she has hurt his friends he that he awakens and is able to blow apart her castle and transport everyone home along with turning back time so no one except Michiru remembers the event. Maika and his other sisters ensure that Haruo is kept in the dark about them using magic through liberal application of magic <b>memory</b> <b>erasing</b> hammers (no less than three hammers simultaneously at times). It is showing that this is done so often he occasionally seems aware at some level of the erasal asking if [...] "something happened" [...] and once stating {{he had a lot of}} gaps in his memory recently. He seems somewhat naive, and always in the dark about the feelings of people (mainly women who like him) around him. However, he cares about the well being of others.|$|E
40|$|Transport {{properties}} of La 0. 8 Ca 0. 2 MnO 3 thin films 15 and 130 nm thick {{have been investigated}} and confronted with the {{properties of}} bulk single crystals of the same composition. It {{has been found that}} low-temperature resistivity of the films is sensitive to electric current and/or field treatment and thermal history of the sample. Thin films exhibit a variety of metastable resistive states and spontaneously evolve toward high-resistivity state in which the films exhibit highly nonlinear transport behavior at low temperatures. Nonlinear V-I characteristics are well described by indirect tunneling model. The memory of the resistivity can be, at least partly, erased by a heat treatment at temperatures above the <b>memory</b> <b>erasing</b> temperature. The <b>memory</b> <b>erasing</b> temperature for thin films, T= 450 K, is significantly higher than that of single crystals. The results are interpreted in the context of strain driven phase separation. Coexistence of two ferromagnetic phases with different orbital orders and different conductivities is influenced by strains due to thermal cycling and current flow. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|Non-Hebbian {{learning}} is often encountered in different bio-organisms. In these processes, {{the strength of}} a synapse connecting two neurons is controlled not only by the signals exchanged between the neurons, but also by an additional factor external to the synaptic structure. Here we show the implementation of non-Hebbian learning in a single solid-state resistive memory device. The output of our device is controlled not only by the applied voltages, but also by the illumination conditions under which it operates. We demonstrate that our metal/oxide/semiconductor device learns more efficiently at higher applied voltages but also when light, an external parameter, is present during the information writing steps. Conversely, <b>memory</b> <b>erasing</b> is more efficiently at higher applied voltages and in the dark. Translating neuronal activity into simple solid-state devices could provide a deeper understanding of complex brain processes and give insight into non-binary computing possibilities...|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{research}} examining the neural bases of nondeclarative memory has offered intriguing {{insight into how}} functional and dysfunctional implicit learning affects the brain. Long-term modifications of synaptic transmission, in particular, are currently considered the most plausible mechanism underlying memory trace encoding and compulsions, addiction, anxiety, and phobias. Therefore, an effective psychotherapy must be directed to erase maladaptive implicit memories and aberrant synaptic plasticity. This article describes the neurobiological bases of pathogenic memory disruption to provide some insight into how psychotherapy works. At least two mechanisms of unwanted <b>memory</b> <b>erasing</b> appear to be implicated in the effects of psychotherapy: inhibition of memory consolidation/reconsolidation and extinction. Behavioral evidence demonstrated that these two ways to forget are profoundly distinct in nature, and it is increasingly clear that their cellular, synaptic, and molecular underpinnings are different. Accordingly, the blockade of consolidation/reconsolidation erases memories by reversing the plasticity associated with memory maintenance, whereas extinction is a totally new form of plasticity that, similar to the plasticity underlying the old memory, requires protein synthesis-dependent synaptic remodeling...|$|E
