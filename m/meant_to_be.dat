5|$|It {{may be that}} in {{the mind}} of their self-celebrated Svengali...the Sex Pistols were never <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more than a nine-month wonder, a cheap vehicle for some fast money, a few laughs, a touch of the old épater la bourgeoisie. It may also be that {{in the mind of}} their chief {{terrorist}} and propagandist, anarchist veteran...and Situational artist McLaren, the Sex Pistols were <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a force that would set the world on its ear...and finally unite music and politics. The Sex Pistols were all of these things.|$|E
5|$|That's how I {{wanted to}} open the video, because I think it really sets {{up the rest of}} the story. It allows you to imagine you {{yourself}} are not just one person; you're so many. That person has so many stories and memories to draw from, and they all affect your journey profusely. I'm battered quite brutally at the beginning of the video, but at the end, I'm not battered; I'm a bit strange. It's not <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an answer video; it's <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a profuse number of the question.|$|E

Instead Ricou Browning, the film's underwater director, {{used it to}} make Bond's arrival more dramatic.|$|E

5|$|In The Lord of the Rings Tolkien {{pretends to}} be merely the {{translator}} of Bilbo and Frodo's memoirs, collectively known as the Red Book of Westmarch.

5|$|Other virtual {{particles}} {{may contribute}} to the summation as well; for example, two photons may interact indirectly through virtual electron–positron pairs. In fact, such photon-photon scattering (see two-photon physics), as well as electron-photon scattering, is <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> one of the modes of operations of the planned particle accelerator, the International Linear Collider.|$|E
5|$|Section 4 is <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> invoked {{should the}} President's incapacitation {{prevent him from}} {{discharging}} his duties, but he is {{unable or unwilling to}} provide the written declaration called for by Section 3.

5|$|All {{recipes are}} written in the second-person {{singular}} imperative, a grammatical form {{that would not have}} been used to address a person of high rank. The instructions were most likely <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> read aloud by the chef or one of senior cooks to junior members of the kitchen staff, who would carry them out. This style contrasts with the less direct, impersonal way of addressing the reader, characterized by infinitive verb forms, used in 19th-century Polish cookbooks.|$|E

5|$|Chocolina was {{originally}} <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a waitress in Serendipity, but her design impressed Toriyama {{enough that he}} expanded her role into something akin to a shop clerk, and the director wrote a new backstory and new dialogue for her. Isamu Kamikokuryo said that though Chocolina's jovial manner and scanty outfit at times clashed with the game's overall atmosphere, he felt {{she was a good}} inclusion. Chocolina is voiced by Julie Nathanson in English and Seiko Ueda in Japanese.|$|E
