25|$|Also in 1999, Microsoft {{released}} Windows Media DRM, which read {{instructions from}} media files in a rights management language that stated what the user may {{do with the}} media. The language can define how many times the <b>media</b> <b>file</b> can be played, {{and whether or not}} it can be burned to a CD, forwarded, printed, or saved to the local disk. Later versions of Windows Media DRM also allow producers to declare whether or not the user may transfer the <b>media</b> <b>file</b> to other devices, to implement music subscription services that make downloaded files unplayable after subscriptions are cancelled, and to implement regional lockout.|$|E
25|$|Since 2008 Microsoft {{has also}} been using WMA Professional in its Protected Interoperable File Format (PIFF) based on the ISO Base <b>Media</b> <b>File</b> Format and most {{commonly}} used for Smooth Streaming, a form of adaptive bit rate streaming over HTTP. Related industry standards such as DECE UltraViolet and MPEG-DASH have not standardized WMA as a supported audio codec, deciding {{in favor of the}} more industry-prevalent MPEG and Dolby audio codecs.|$|E
50|$|Information {{relating}} to media is imported {{into the library}} including meta data for <b>media</b> <b>files</b> and {{the path to the}} <b>media</b> <b>files.</b> The <b>media</b> <b>files</b> themselves are not contained in the database, but cataloged within the libraries.|$|R
25|$|Media Library: At installation, Winamp {{scans the}} user's system for <b>media</b> <b>files</b> {{to add to}} the Media Library database. It {{supports}} full Unicode filenames and Unicode metadata for <b>media</b> <b>files.</b> In the <b>Media</b> Library user interface pane, under Local Media, several selectors (Audio, Video, date, and frequency) permit display of subsets of <b>media</b> <b>files</b> with greater detail.|$|R
25|$|<b>Media</b> <b>files</b> {{are stored}} on an iPod in a hidden folder, {{along with a}} {{proprietary}} database file. The hidden content can be accessed on the host operating system by enabling hidden files to be shown. The <b>media</b> <b>files</b> can then be recovered manually by copying the files or folders off the iPod. Many third-party applications also allow easy copying of <b>media</b> <b>files</b> off of an iPod.|$|R
25|$|Unlike {{the main}} C API of QuickTime {{where it is}} {{necessary}} to call MoviesTask in a loop to load a <b>media</b> <b>file,</b> DirectShow handles all of this in a transparent way. It creates several background threads that smoothly play the requested file or URL without much work required from the programmer. Also in contrast to QuickTime, nothing special is required for loading a URL instead of a local file on diskDirectShow's filter graph abstracts these details from the programmer, although recent developments in QuickTime (including an ActiveX control) have reduced this disparity.|$|E
25|$|By default, DirectShow {{includes}} {{a number of}} filters for decoding some common <b>media</b> <b>file</b> formats such as MPEG-1, MP3, Windows Media Audio, Windows Media Video, MIDI, media containers such as AVI, ASF, WAV, some splitters/demultiplexers, multiplexers, source and sink filters and some static image filters. Since the associated patented technologies are licensed in Windows, no license fees are required (e.g., to Fraunhofer, for MP3). Some codecs such as MPEG-4 Advanced Simple Profile, AAC, H.264, Vorbis and containers MOV, MP4 are available from 3rd parties. Incorporating support for additional codecs such as these can involve paying the licensing fees to the involved codec technology developer or patent holder.|$|E
25|$|The search {{functionality}} {{is exposed}} using the search bars in the Start menu {{and the upper}} right hand corner of Windows Explorer windows, as well as Open/Save dialog boxes. When searching from the Start menu, the results are shown in the Start menu itself, overlapping the recently used programs. From the Start menu, {{it is also possible}} to launch an application by searching for its executable image name or display name. Searching from the search bars in Explorer windows replaces the content of the current folder with the search results. The Explorer windows can also render thumbnails in the search results if a Thumbnail Handler is registered for a particular file type. It can also render enhanced previews of items in a Preview Pane without launching the default application, if the application has registered a Preview Handler. This can provide functionality such as file type-specific navigation (such a browsing a presentation using next/previous controls, or seeking inside a <b>media</b> <b>file).</b> Preview handlers can also allow certain kind of selections (such as highlighting a text snippet) to be performed from the preview pane itself. In the Control Panel, the search bar in the window can also search for Control Panel options. However, unlike WDS, Windows Search does not support creating aliases.|$|E

25|$|Windows Explorer's task {{panel has}} been removed, {{integrating}} the relevant task options into the toolbar. A Favorites pane {{on the left}} contains commonly accessed folders and prepopulated Search Folders. Seven different views are available to view files and folders, namely, List, Details, Small icons, Medium icons, Large icons, Extra large icons or Tiles. File and folder actions such as Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo, Redo, Delete, Rename and Properties are built into a dropdown menu which appears when the Organize button is clicked. It is also possible to change {{the layout of the}} Explorer window by using the Organize button. Users can select whether to display Classic Menus, a Search Pane, a Preview Pane, a Reading Pane, and/or the Navigation Pane. Document Properties are available from the common 'Open' and 'Save' dialog boxes, so it is easier to add metadata (such as author or subject) to a document. The metadata can be viewed and edited in the Details Pane that shows up at the bottom of an Explorer window. The Navigation Pane contains a list of most common folders (the Favorites) for quick navigation. It can also show the folder layout of the entire hard drive or a subset of it. It can contain both real folders as well as virtual ones. By default it contains links to folders such as Documents and the publicly shared folder, as well as virtual folders that search and present the saved virtual folders and that lists the recently changed documents. The Preview Pane can be used to preview the contents of a document, including viewing pictures in a size larger than the thumbnails shown in the folder listing, and sampling contents of a <b>media</b> <b>file,</b> without opening any additional program. Explorer can show a preview for any image format if the necessary codec authored using the Windows Imaging Component is installed. Also, if an application installs Preview handlers (like Office 2007 does), then the documents can be edited in the preview pane itself.|$|E

2500|$|On February 11, 1998, the ISO {{approved}} the QuickTime file format {{as the basis}} of the MPEG‑4 file format. The MPEG-4 file format specification was created {{on the basis of the}} QuickTime format specification published in 2001. The MP4 (.mp4) file format was published in 2001 as the revision of the MPEG-4 Part 1: Systems specification published in 1999 (ISO/IEC 14496-1:2001). In 2003, the first version of MP4 format was revised and replaced by MPEG-4 Part 14: MP4 file format (ISO/IEC 14496-14:2003). The MP4 file format was generalized into the ISO Base <b>Media</b> <b>File</b> Format ISO/IEC 14496-12:2004, which defines a general structure for time-based media files. It in turn is used as the basis for other multimedia file formats (for example 3GP, Motion JPEG 2000). A list of all registered extensions for ISO Base <b>Media</b> <b>File</b> Format is published on the official registration authority website [...] This registration authority for code-points in [...] "MP4 Family" [...] files is Apple Computer Inc. and it is named in Annex D (informative) in MPEG-4 Part 12.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBased on {{twelve months}} of multi-sited ethnographic fieldwork, this article investigates the offline {{circulation}} of digital <b>media</b> <b>files</b> in Solomon Islands. It explores how circular temporary labour migration drives the acquisition, movement {{and consumption of}} digital media, and how these <b>media</b> <b>files</b> contribute to moral controversies. Before the rapid proliferation of mobile phones in 2010, people living in rural environments had limited access to electronic media and the male village elite controlled access to this media, especially foreign movies. Mobile phones, on the other hand, are individually owned and encourage private consumption of <b>media</b> <b>files.</b> At the same time, migrants living in urban areas can easily obtain digital <b>media</b> <b>files</b> and have started integrating them into remittance networks. Access to electronic media in rural areas has exploded. Because foreign visual media are associated with urban, morally ambivalent lifestyles, this proliferation has also fuelled moral uncertainties among rural residents. This article suggests that to understand these moral controversies, and their significance in contemporary Solomon Islands, {{it is crucial to}} account for the mobility of digital <b>media</b> <b>files</b> offline and alongside the movements of temporary labourers...|$|R

5000|$|The 3GP {{file format}} stores video streams as MPEG-4 Part 2, H.263, or MPEG-4 Part 10 (AVC/H.264), and audio streams as AMR-NB, AMR-WB, AMR-WB+, AAC-LC, HE-AAC v1 or Enhanced aacPlus (HE-AAC v2). 3GPP allowed use of AMR and H.263 codecs in the ISO base <b>media</b> <b>file</b> format (MPEG-4 Part 12), because 3GPP {{specified}} {{the usage of}} the Sample Entry and template fields in the ISO base <b>media</b> <b>file</b> format as well as defining new boxes to which codecs refer.

For the storage of MPEG-4 media specific information in 3GP files, the 3GP specification refers to MP4 and the AVCfile format, which are also based on the ISO base <b>media</b> <b>file</b> format.
