50|$|Before the 1980s, most {{computers}} were text-based. The operator used the keyboard {{as the main}} input device to type in necessary commands into the terminal that could only display text on a low-resolution <b>monochrome</b> <b>video</b> <b>monitor.</b> The majority of end-user software was also written in text-based mode during this time. During this era, operating a computer {{was considered to be}} a challenging task because of the complexity of the text-based environment.|$|R
5000|$|In 1987 {{longtime}} small computer maker Zenith {{introduced a}} low-cost PC {{they called the}} eaZy PC. This was positioned as an [...] "appliance" [...] computer much like the original Apple Macintosh: turnkey startup, built-in <b>monochrome</b> <b>video</b> <b>monitor,</b> and lacking expansion slots requiring proprietary add-ons available only from Zenith, but instead with the traditional MS-DOS Command-line interface. The eaZy PC used a turbo NEC V40 CPU (uprated 8088) which was rather slow for its time, but the <b>video</b> <b>monitor</b> did feature 400 pixel vertical resolution. This unique computer failed {{for the same reasons}} as did IBM's PCjr: poor performance and expandability, and a price too high for the home market.|$|R

50|$|In actual practice, {{different}} machines used different video standards - for example, the Sony PCM-1610 {{only used}} 525/60 <b>monochrome</b> <b>video</b> (NTSC, US), not 625/50 (PAL, Europe) or NTSC color.|$|R
5000|$|I/O ports: 44-pin Edge {{connector}} with Z80 Bus, tape (DIN connector), <b>monochrome</b> <b>video</b> out (PAL timings, DIN connector), UHF TV out (RCA connector) and two 8-bit parallel ports (e.g. printer {{and general}} port) ...|$|R
50|$|For example, the <b>{{monochrome}}</b> <b>video</b> adapter {{memory area}} ran from 704 to 736 KiB (0xB0000-0xB7FFF). If only a {{monochrome display adapter}} was used, the address space between 0xA0000 and 0xAFFFF {{could be used for}} RAM, which would be contiguous with the conventional memory.|$|R
50|$|The {{composite}} <b>monochrome</b> <b>video</b> signal (CVS) {{is composed}} of a video signal superimposed on an auxiliary signal of 300 mV. The levels between 0 and 300 mV are assigned for the auxiliary signal and the levels between 300 and 1000 mV are assigned to video information.|$|R
50|$|The Indian-head {{test pattern}} was not {{generated}} by pointing a camera at a card, as many older test patterns were. Rather, it was generated directly as a <b>monochrome</b> <b>video</b> signal {{by means of}} a monoscope tube, a specialized video camera tube with the pattern built into the tube.|$|R
50|$|All 480Zs, {{with the}} {{exception}} of some very early units, were fitted with software-switchable 40×24 or 80×24 character text-only <b>monochrome</b> <b>video</b> hardware. Composite video output was provided for an external monitor, and an internal RF modulator provided a separate output to drive a television set. The text-mode display had its own dedicated memory.|$|R
5000|$|A very High {{resolution}} <b>monochrome</b> <b>video</b> {{card with}} blitter and hardware text line and arc drawing capability, {{was designed for}} CAD applications, based on the NEC µPD7220 chip designed for graphic terminals, but was also used by some personal computers like the DEC Rainbow, and notably also for the Tulip System I.|$|R
50|$|Video output was black-and-white, {{character}}-based. However, the ZX80 {{character set}} included some simple block-based graphics glyphs, allowing crude graphics to be accomplished, with some effort. One advantage to using <b>monochrome</b> <b>video</b> is that different colour broadcast standards (e.g. PAL, NTSC) simply weren't an issue {{when the system}} was sold outside the UK.|$|R
50|$|The 380Z used a Z80 {{microprocessor}} (hence the name) {{with up to}} 56 KB of user RAM. When {{fitted with}} an optional floppy disk drive the system ran the CP/M operating system. The basic system came with a text-only <b>monochrome</b> <b>video</b> card, which could be enhanced with a 320×192 high-resolution graphics board.|$|R
50|$|Not {{strictly}} an operating system, the MGR windowing system run under 1616/OS, but usurped the console video and keyboard, and added virtual tty devices for each window. The MGR port required a video hack {{to add a}} higher resolution but <b>monochrome</b> <b>video</b> mode; this was done by replacing a PAL in the video circuit.|$|R

50|$|Atari's 16-bit {{computer}} range utilized a 13-pin DIN connector for its video output; {{this single}} connector could carry the colour RGB signals, a composite video signal, the high-resolution <b>monochrome</b> <b>video</b> signal, {{vertical and horizontal}} sync, ground, mono audio, and later, external video clock input, each on its own dedicated pin. If Pin 4 was connected to ground, the computer would detect this and boot into the high-resolution <b>monochrome</b> <b>video</b> mode that was not user-selectable and only worked with specially designed monitors (the vertical refresh rate being 71 Hz as opposed to 50/60 Hz for colour modes). Atari also used a 14-pin DIN connector for their external floppy disk drives, primarily for space-saving reasons; the port occupies much less of the crowded rear of the computer than on contemporaries such as the Amiga and Macintosh, which used physically larger D-shell connectors with a 20+ pin count.|$|R
50|$|Galaksija did {{not have}} a {{dedicated}} video circuitry. Inspired by a CDP 1802 application book, its Z80A CPU was directly responsible for modulating the <b>monochrome</b> <b>video</b> signal with a little help of a shift register. Galaksija's CPU would write one byte to the shift register, which would, in turn, serialize its 8 bits one by one to the video output.|$|R

50|$|In DOS memory management, {{the upper}} memory area (UMA) refers to memory between the {{addresses}} of 640 KB and 1024 KB (0xA0000-0xFFFFF) in an IBM PC or compatible.

40|$|When an airbag deploys on a {{rear-facing}} infant seat, it can injure or {{kill the}} infant. When an airbag deploys {{on an empty}} seat, the airbag and the money to replace it are wasted. We have shown that video images {{can be used to}} determine whether or not to deploy the passenger-side airbag in a crash. Images of the passenger seat, taken from a video camera mounted inside the vehicle, can be used to classify the seat as either empty, containing a rear-facing infant seat, or occupied. Our first experiment used a single, <b>monochrome</b> <b>video</b> camera. The system was automatically trained on a series of test images. Using a principle components (eigenimages) nearest neighbor classifier, it achieved a correct classification rate of 99. 5 % on a test of 910 images.

40|$|Dementia care is {{becoming}} increasingly important in Japan as the elderly population grows. Care homes are designed so that caregivers can easily observe and subsequently respond {{to the needs of}} people with dementia. However, the layout of care homes can become overly restrictive for residents, for example, by not providing intermediate spaces where people can spontaneously interact and initiate conversations. We present a case study that explores the implementation of <b>video</b> <b>monitoring</b> in two purpose-built care homes in which we were asked to help overcome the blind spots presented by the layout. We collected data {{both before and after the}} implementation of the <b>video</b> <b>monitoring</b> in order to understand its effect. The balance between people’s sense of security and the concerns about loss of privacy through <b>video</b> <b>monitoring</b> is well established. However, we found that <b>video</b> <b>monitoring</b> had a beneficial effect on both the caregivers and the residents if implemented sensitively. Furthermore, the implementation of <b>video</b> <b>monitoring</b> could support the design of more beneficial care home layouts. In conclusion, we propose that the sensitive implementation of <b>video</b> <b>monitoring</b> be considered alongside design of the physical layout of care homes...|$|R
