40|$|In future {{real-time}} {{systems such}} as those required for intelligent autonomous vehicle control, we need flexibility in choosing the set of services to support under varying environmental conditions and system states. It is infeasible to make an optimal choice at run-time, so we propose a method of ranking the services pre runtime, based on the `utility' of each service. We show how to compute and assign values rationally, using expert domain knowledge, thus making `value-based scheduling' a reality. Keywords: Intelligent Autonomous Vehicles, Flexible Real-Time, Value-based Scheduling, Modes, Analytic Hierarchy Process. 1. INTRODUCTION Current real-time systems are scheduled statically, or pre run-time, with a fixed set of `hard services' (those which cannot afford to <b>miss</b> <b>any</b> <b>deadlines)</b> being mapped onto the available resources. Pre run-time checks are used {{to ensure that all}} timing constraints are satisfied. In contrast, future real time {{systems such as}} those required for autonomous [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} multiprocessor scheduling problem of hard real-time systems, and it especially focuses on optimal and global schedulers when practical constraints {{are taken into}} account. First, we propose an improvement of the optimal algorithm BF. We formally prove that our adaptation is (i) optimal, i. e., it always generates a feasible schedule as long as such a schedule exists, and (ii) valid, i. e., it complies with the all the requirements. We also show that it outperforms BF by providing a computing complexity of O(n), where n {{is the number of}} tasks to be scheduled. Next, we propose a schedulability analysis which indicates a priori whether the real-time application can be scheduled by our improvement of BF without <b>missing</b> <b>any</b> <b>deadline.</b> This analysis is, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, the first such test for multiprocessors that takes into account all the main overheads generated by the Operating System.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{assigning}} blocks of video streams to disks in News on Demand video servers. Specifically, given the common assumption that video streams are striped across the disks, we consider how to map successive blocks to disks to maximize performance. Our work begins by noting that the commonly proposed round-robin assignment, in which successive blocks of every stream are mapped to successive disks, provides the guarantee that once a video stream starts it will never miss a deadline, but that the latency to start a stream may be high due to the "convoy effect. " We propose and analyze an alternative scheme, the random mapping of successive blocks to disks. Using both analytic and simulation techniques, we show that random mapping and replication significantly reduce the latency to start a new stream, and the number of missed deadlines is negligible. Further, we prove that with enough copies, no request sequence will <b>miss</b> <b>any</b> <b>deadlines,</b> for loads that are a significant f [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Embedded {{parallel}} {{and distributed}} computing systems for real-time applications are becoming commonplace. Many such real-time applications are life-critical and require extensive fault-tolerance capabilities {{in order to}} ensure very high reliability. At the same time, cost, power, weight, and volume constraints require that any introduced redundancy must be efficiently used. Thus, failure-recovery strategies must be implemented to allow the system to most efficiently manage its resources in the presence of one or more failures, while attempting to continue the execution of the current tasks so as to not <b>miss</b> <b>any</b> <b>deadlines.</b> We have developed such a resource-management algorithm, which selects the optimal failure recovery procedure to be employed when a processor failure is detected. Further, in order to test this and other possible recovery algorithms, we have developed the RAPIDS simulator testbed. This paper describes the testbed, and shows how it provides a framework in which to simulate distributed real-time systems. In addition we describe how RAPIDS allows the user to validate fault recovery algorithms.

40|$|The exact {{stochastic}} {{analysis of}} most real-time systems is becoming unffordable in current practice. On one side, the exact {{calculation of the}} response time distribution of the tasks is not possible except for simple periodic and inde-pendent task sets. On the other side, in practice, tasks in-troduce complexities like release jitter, blocking in shared resources, stochastic dependencies, etc, {{which can not be}} handled by the periodic and independent task set model. This paper introduces the concept of pessimism in the stochastic analysis of real-time systems in the following sense: the exact probability of <b>missing</b> <b>any</b> <b>deadline</b> is al-ways lower than that derived from the pessimistic analysis. Therefore, if real-time constraints are expressed as proba-bilities of missing deadlines, the pessimistic stochastic anal-ysis provides safe results. Some applications of the pessimism concept are pre-sented. Firstly, the practical problems that arise in the stochastic analysis of periodic and independent task sets are addressed. Secondly, we extend to the stochastic case some well known techniques of the deterministic analysis, such as the blocking in shared resources, and the task pri-ority assignment. 1...|$|R

40|$|Tasks {{that form}} the base load of a {{real-time}} system usually come with hard deadlines {{and need to be}} executed periodically. In addition to these periodic tasks, aperiodic tasks may be invoked randomly in response to environmental stimuli. These randomly-arriving aperiodic tasks usually come with soft deadlines, but their response times may still be important to the overall system performance. It is therefore important to schedule tasks so as to provide responsive services for soft aperiodic tasks without <b>missing</b> <b>any</b> periodic task <b>deadline.</b> In this paper, we propose an algorithm, called the last chance (LC) algorithm, that meets this objective. The LC algorithm is globally optimal {{in the sense that it}} provides the minimal aperiodic task response time while meeting all periodic task deadlines among all possible periodic and aperiodic task scheduling methods. Since the LC algorithm may require a significant amount of on-line computation, we also propose a suboptimal algorithm whose on-lin [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Wireless {{networks}} {{are making their}} way into new application areas which have traditionally utilized wired networks as the underlying communication medium. The migration to a wireless medium leads to a cut-down in bandwidth. Even though many parallel frequency channels are available, often only a single frequency is used by today’s standard implementations. Furthermore, application areas such as networked industrial control systems are dependent upon hard real-time services being provided by underlying layers. In order to meet this demands, {{and at the same}} time increase network bandwidth, we present a deterministic wireless multichannel MAC protocol, called MC-EDF, which can provide real-time guarantees for deadline-seeking traffic. One channel is used for control traffic, while the rest of the channels are used for data traffic. Simulation results indicate that a utilization of the data channels of 90 % is reachable without <b>any</b> <b>missed</b> <b>deadlines...</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine if and how the psychosocial work {{environment}} has affect on sickness presenteeism for employees. The study was conducted at one of the largest industries in Norrbotten where three working teams have been examined. The analysis was based on the theory that constituted the study and the descriptions of various experiences from the respondents regarding work demands, control, support and sickness presenteeism. The results show that all the examined working teams experiences that the psychosocial work environment directly affects the sickness presenteeism. Factors such as heavy workload, the work piles up, loyalty to colleagues and the difficulty for others to take over proved crucial for the respondents to work despite illness. Other factors like duties require employee attendance, fear of <b>missing</b> <b>any</b> fun, <b>deadlines</b> and the pressure of delivering on time was also found to affect the sickness presenteeism. The respondents perceive their work situation through high work demands, a heavy workload and at times very stressful. Control varies depending on the examined working team and the support is perceived as high. The obstacle that are perceived to be existing regarding control is primarily for the planners in form of lack of influence over the exportation groups and the technicians that are controlled by the unexpected which makes it difficult for them to plan and control in and over their work. One difficulty in getting support from external divisions is present, which is experienced due to the fact that other colleagues do not have issues clarified for themselves in certain situations like the closest colleagues in the own working team have. In addition, respondents perceive themselves as happy at work and experience the working atmosphere as well and they feel they have good colleagues. This study shows that sickness presenteeism and psychosocial work environment are related and are important issues to work with, both from a human perspective but also from an organizational perspective.

5000|$|Workplace {{communication}} {{is the process}} of exchanging information, both verbal and non-verbal, within an organization. An organization may consist of employees from different parts of the society. These may have different cultures and backgrounds, and can be used to different norms. To unite activities of all employees and restrain from <b>any</b> <b>missed</b> <b>deadline</b> or activity that could affect the company negatively, {{communication is}} crucial. Effective workplace communication ensures that all the organizational objectives are achieved. Workplace communication is tremendously important to organizations because it increases productivity and efficiency. Ineffective workplace communication leads to communication gaps between employees, which causes confusion, wastes time, and reduces productivity. Misunderstandings that cause friction between people can be avoided by effective workplace communication.Effective communication, also called open communication, prevents barriers from forming among individuals within companies that might impede progress in striving to reach a common goal. For businesses to function as desired, managers and lower-level employees must be able to interact clearly and effectively with each other through verbal communication and non-verbal communication to achieve specific business goals. Effective communication with clients plays a vital role in development of an organization and success of any business. When communicating, nonverbal communication must also be taken into consideration. How a person delivers a message has a lot of influence on the meaning of this one.|$|R
