He observed that under the circumstances it was uncharitable {{on the part of some}} persons to create disturbances in Mecca. He said that he was not afraid of death, but he did not want the Muslims to be guilty of bloodshed. To him the solidarity of the Muslim community was very dear and in order to prevent dissension among the Muslims he had instructed his supporters to refrain from violence. He wanted the people to be afraid of God and not to indulge in activities subversive of Islam. He pointed out that the foreign powers smarting under their defeat inflicted by the Muslim arms had sponsored some conspiracies to subvert Islam. He warned the people not to play in the hands of the enemies of Islam. He appealed to the rebels to retire from Madina. He wanted the people of Madina to support the cause of truth and justice and withhold their support from the rebels bent on mischief.|$|E

30|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{described}} 42 cases {{of breast cancer}} identified using AIC in combination with CNB. No special features in the backgrounds of the patients were observed, indicating the universal applicability of this simple method. More {{than half of the}} tumors in the present study measured less than 2 cm in diameter, and all tumors measuring more than 2 cm in diameter showed either ductal carcinoma in situ or sclerosing type, histologically. As described earlier, it has been clearly demonstrated that AIC has a significant additional impact for diagnosing lesions with characteristics that indicate possible difficulties in making an accurate diagnosis with CNB alone. In this study, we experienced five false-positive cases with AIC. After confirming the final pathology using tissue obtained by MMT, both cases were revealed to have been diagnosed correctly on CNB. The diseases observed in these five cases (three cases of fibroadenoma and two cases of intra ductal papilloma) tend to be overly diagnosed using cytology (Giard & Hermans 1992). It may be possible to omit performing MMT with more intimate <b>mutual</b> <b>consultations</b> between surgeons and pathologists.|$|R

For these households, remittances represented an important source of income, accounting for 43% of their total income. 52% of wives of the migrants independently decided how to spend the money received. In the remaining cases, the head of the household enjoyed a fair deal of autonomy as the decision on how to use the remittance money was reached through <b>mutual</b> <b>consultation</b> between the migrant and the head of the household and only in a few cases (11%) did the migrant decide alone.|$|E

40|$|The {{significance}} of effective interprofessional teamwork {{to improve the}} quality of care has been widely recognised. Effective interprofessional teamwork calls on good collaboration between professionals and patients, coordination between professionals, and the development of teamwork over time. Effective development of teams also requires support from the wider organisational context. In a Dutch village, healthcare professionals work closely together, and <b>mutual</b> <b>consultations</b> as well as interprofessional meetings take place on a regular basis. The network was created as a precondition for sustainable interprofessional teamwork in elderly care. However, several external barriers were experienced regarding the supportive structure and cooperative attitude of the healthcare insurer and municipality. The aim of the article is to examine these experience-based issues regarding internal organisation, perspective, and definition of effective teamwork. Complicating factors refer to finding the right key figures, and the different perspectives on team development and team effectiveness. Our conclusion is that the organisation of healthcare insurance companies needs to implement fundamental changes to facilitate an interprofessional care approach. Furthermore, municipalities should work on their vision of the needs and benefits of a fruitful collaboration with interprofessional healthcare teams. The challenge for healthcare teams is to learn to speak the language of external partners. To support the development of interprofessional teams, external parties need to recognise and trust in a shared aim to provide quality of care in an efficient and effective way...|$|R
