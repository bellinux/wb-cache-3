40|$|To {{assess the}} {{willingness}} of physicians and nurses with training in basic cardiac life support to provide mouth-to-mouth resuscitation in both hospital and out-of-hospital settings, we surveyed all attendees at a <b>monthly</b> <b>advanced</b> life support course over a 1 -year period. Of 622 attendees, 379 (61 %) responded to our survey describing a variety of cardiac arrest scenarios. Less {{than half of the}} participants surveyed were willing to do mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on an unknown adult, male or female, who had collapsed in a supermarket. Overall, the group was willing to do mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on victims known to them: their neighbors (84 %), children at a pool (88 %), spouses (94 %), and parents (93 %). In the hospital setting, knowing a patient's human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status greatly influenced the willingness to do mouth-to-mouth rescue. If a patient's HIV status was unknown, only a third of providers would do mouth-to-mouth resuscitation; if the HIV status was known to be negative, two thirds would do mouth-to-mouth resuscitation (P < 0. 002), Children in the hospital whose HIV status was unknown would receive mouth-to-mouth resuscitation by 57 % of the respondents. Children known to be HIV-negative would be resuscitated by 79 % of the respondents. Co-workers were more willing to resuscitate a known physician or nurse than an unknown co-worker, with physicians more willing than nurses to do mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on an unknown co-worker. A third of the group has performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation previously. Although an increased percentage of this subgroup was willing to provide mouth-to-mouth in all adult hospital scenarios, experienced providers of mouth-to-mouth wanted to receive mouth-to-mouth resuscitation less frequently (75 %) than inexperienced providers (84 %) (P = 0. 02).

40|$|The {{administration}} of the relevant part of EAGGF Guarantee expenditure, which {{accounts for more than}} 50 % of the budget of the European Communities follows shared management arrangements. Shared management means that member states pay and control the expenditure for agricultural and rural development subsidies and the Commission is responsible for the {{administration of}} payments and for auditing the control system of member states. The communication on the expenditure effected by accredited paying agencies takes place via a comprehensive financial reporting system and monthly EAGGF Committee meetings. These meetings provide scope for the reconciliation of any disagreement concerning the <b>monthly</b> <b>advances</b> reimbursed by the Commission to member states and also give an overview on actual budget implementation. The new member states which joined the European Union on 1 May 2004 have started to apply the comprehensive financial reporting system following an intensive cooperation period in the form of training seminars provided to them by the Commission for setting up the reporting systems of paying agencies. The first expenditure from the EAGGF Guarantee Section was executed in July 2004 and reported to the Commission during the following month. The pioneer new member states were the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland, followed by Hungary, Estonia and Slovenia a month later. Until the end of August approximately 6 million Euros have been withdrawn from the Fund, used in a fifty-fifty percent split for export restitutions for milk and milk products, beef and veal, live animals and eggs to countries outside the European Union and for other market intervention measures, such as supply of food from intervention stocks for distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community, production refunds on sugar used in the chemical industry, aid for skimmed milk processed into casein and school milk. By the end of the 2004 financial year (15 October 2004) some other new member states, Lithuania, Latvia and Cyprus also intend to start paying agricultural subsidies to their beneficiaries. The total estimated value of expenditure to be withdrawn from EAGGF Guarantee by the new member states in the 2004 financial year and charged therefore to the 2004 budget is circa an additional 14 million Euros. Therefore, the aggregated amount of the subsidy withdrawn by the EU- 10 countries charged to the 2004 budget will be ca. 20 million Euros, which is a minor amount compared to the budget appropriations included in the 2004 budget for EAGGF Guarantee as a whole. A speeding up of subsidy withdrawals is necessary for new member states to make the best use of benefit from CAP. It is possible to achieve this goal by the withdrawal of subsidies for direct aids. Direct aids can be paid to farmers in the framework of the Single Area Payment Scheme from {{the first day of the}} 2005 financial year (16 October 2004) in case of new member states (except Malta and Slovenia). The advances to member states will be reimbursed in January 2005 and charged therefore to the 2005 budget. As it was the case for earlier enlargements of the European Union, the first months of subsidy withdrawals are being used mainly to get acquainted with the administration and to test the operation of the paying agency systems. However, this period should be considered strictly as an interim phase and significant effort should be made by the national agricultural administrations to widen the â€œpenetrabilityâ€ of the subsidy handling, that is to increase the amount of subsidy withdrawn from the EU by the paying agency systems already operating in the new member states to benefit from the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union. withdrawn from the EU Funds, target branches, paying agency systems, Agricultural and Food Policy, Crop Production/Industries, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{national}} and international regulatory reforms (e. g. U. S. FAIR and other GATT compliance reforms) in agricultural markets has led some observers to wonder whether {{the private sector is}} able to produce a level of price volatility that is socially acceptable. In this paper, we examine the post reform track record of price volatility and its transmission across vertically linked and geographically linked markets. Livestock, grain, and dairy market data (monthly) are considered across the U. S. and E. C. The standard commodity-pricing model supports the hypothesis that competitive storage acts to reduce the volatility of cash prices. Further, speculative attacks and stock outs have been shown to induce increased volatility. This motivates a scope of consideration that includes prices as well as stock levels to assess their contribution to price volatility. The paper considers evidence based on three decades of <b>monthly</b> data and <b>advanced</b> time series techniques. First, univariate volatility estimates based on the autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model are evaluated and compared to historical temporal variation to highlight the importance of well grounded estimation of volatility. Next, the relationships between stocks and the conditional mean, as well as the conditional and unconditional variances of the price series, are assessed for dairy and grain products. Finally, reform associated changes {{in the structure of the}} transmission of volatility through vertical markets are considered for dairy products and across geographic markets is considered for grains. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Neural network {{classifiers}} {{have been}} shown to provide supervised classification results that significantly improve on traditional classification algorithms such as the Bayesian (maximum likelihood [ML]) classifier. While the predominant neural network architecture has been the feedforward multilayer perceptron known as backpropagation, Adaptive resonance theory (ART) neural networks offer advantages to the classification of optical remote sensing data for vegetation and land cover mapping. A significant advantage {{is that it does not}} require prior specification of the neural net structure, creating as many internal nodes as are needed to represent the calibration (training) data. The Gaussian ARTMAP classification algorithm bases the probability that input training samples belong to specific classes on the parameters of its Gaussian distributions: the means, standard deviations, and a priori probabilities. The performance of the Gaussian ARTMAP classification algorithm in terms of classification accuracy using independent validation data indicated was over 70 % accurate when applied to an annual series of <b>monthly</b> 1 -km <b>advanced</b> very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) satellite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data.

Thus, it provides a realistic test of the algorithms for operational classification of a regional remote sensing and site dataset...|$|R
