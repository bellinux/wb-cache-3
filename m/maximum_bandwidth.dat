The lane data structure has been changed to a packet-based format. The lane encoding is changed from 8b/10b to 16b/18b (reducing the overhead from 20% to 11%).|$|E

In this paper, we study bandwidth allocation in multi-channel multihop wireless mesh networks.

In order to achieve a good tradeoff between fairness and throughput, we consider a simple max-min fairness model which leads to high throughput solutions with guaranteed <b>maximum</b> minimum <b>bandwidth</b> allocation values, and the well-known Lexicographical Max-Min (LMM) model. Correspondingly, we formulate the Max-min guaranteed <b>Maximum</b> throughput <b>Bandwidth</b> Allocation (MMBA) problem and the Lexicographical Max-Min Bandwidth Allocation (LMMBA) problem.
