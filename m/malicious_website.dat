Various methodologies are proposed to detect the <b>malicious</b> <b>websites</b> based on features like web contents, HTML codes, session information, and dynamic behaviours. We then apply kAYO to a dataset of over 350, 000 known benign and malicious mobile web pages and demonstrate 90 % accuracy in classification. Moreover, we discover, characterize and report a number of web pages missed by Google Safe Browsing and Virus Total, but detected by kAYO.

40|$|<b>Malicious</b> <b>websites</b> {{are a major}} cyber attack vector, and {{effective}} detection of them is an important cyber defense task. The main defense paradigm {{in this regard is}} that the defender uses some kind of machine learning algorithms to train a detection model, which is then used to classify websites in question. Unlike other settings, the following issue is inherent to the problem of <b>malicious</b> <b>websites</b> detection: the attacker essentially has access to the same data that the defender uses to train its detection models. This 'symmetry' can be exploited by the attacker, at least in principle, to evade the defender's detection models. In this paper, we present a framework for characterizing the evasion and counter-evasion interactions between the attacker and the defender, where the attacker attempts to evade the defender's detection models by taking advantage of this symmetry. Within this framework, we show that an adaptive attacker can make <b>malicious</b> <b>websites</b> evade powerful detection models, but proactive training can be an effective counter-evasion defense mechanism. The framework is geared toward the popular detection model of decision tree, but can be adapted to accommodate other classifiers...|$|R

Our approach uses malicious code crawling to rearrange websites {{in the order of}} their risk index by analyzing the centrality between malware sites and proactively eliminates the root of these sites by finding the core-hub node, thereby reducing unnecessary security policies. In particular, we dynamically estimate the risk index of the affected websites by analyzing various centrality measures and converting them into a single quantified vector. On average, the proactive elimination of core <b>malicious</b> <b>websites</b> results in an average improvement in zero-day attack detection of more than 20 %...|$|R
