40|$|Abstract—Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) {{supporting}} modern streaming multimedia applications {{constitute a}} very challenging and rapidly changing field of research. Towards implementing effective multimedia wireless networks, the IEEE has published the “state {{of the art}} ” IEEE 802. 11 e standard, which introduced a QoS-aware MAC-layer along {{with a series of}} efficiency enhancements. However, it has been proven inadequate in handling multimedia traffic optimally in periods of congestion. For the efficient support of multimedia applications in high load situations, numerous mechanisms have emerged, most of them focusing on altering the static nature of resource allocation specified in IEEE 802. 11 e. Nevertheless, traffic characteristics must be taken into consideration in order to achieve the highest gains. In this paper, an application-aware MAC-layer mechanism is developed that exploits <b>multimedia</b> <b>frame</b> semantics and existing MAC-layer enhancements to adequately cope with high congestion situations in IEEE 802. 11 e infrastructure networks. The proposed algorithm makes use of existing acknowledgment policies and adaptive resource allocation techniques depending on <b>multimedia</b> <b>frame</b> significance. The effectiveness of the algorithm is proven by means of simulations, where its functionality is evaluated and compared with other existing schemes.

40|$|As {{streaming}} {{techniques and}} wireless access networks become more widely deployed, a streaming multimedia {{connection with the}} “last mile ” being a wireless network is be-coming increasingly common. However, since current streaming techniques are primarily designed for wired networks, streaming multimedia applications can perform poorly in wireless networks. Recent {{research has shown that}} the wireless network conditions, such as the wireless link layer rate adaptation, contending traffic, and interference can significantly degrade the performance of streaming media applications. This performance degradation includes increased <b>multimedia</b> <b>frame</b> losses and lower image quality caused by packet loss, and multiple rebuffering events that stop the media playout. This dissertation presents the model, design, implementation and evaluation of an application layer solution for improving streaming multimedia application performance in IEEE 802. 11 wireless networks by using enhanced bandwidth estimation techniques.

40|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of interactive}} multimedia applications over the Internet has created a problem of congestion. This is because a majority of these applications {{do not respond to}} congestion indicators. This leads to resource starvation for responsive flows, and ultimately excessive delay and losses for all flows therefore loss of quality. This results in unfair sharing of network resources and increasing the risk of network ‘congestion collapse’. Current Congestion Control Mechanisms such as ‘TCP-Friendly Rate Control’ (TFRC) have been able to achieve ‘fair-share’ of network resource when competing with responsive flows such as TCP, but TFRC’s method of congestion response (i. e. to reduce Packet Rate) is not ideally matched for interactive multimedia applications which maintain a fixed Frame Rate. This mismatch of the two rates (Packet Rate and Frame Rate) leads to buffering of frames at the Sender Buffer resulting in delay and loss, and an unacceptable reduction of quality or complete loss of service for the end-user. To address this issue, this thesis proposes a novel Congestion Control Mechanism which is referred to as ‘TCP-friendly rate control – Fine Grain Scalable’ (TFGS) for interactive multimedia applications. This new approach allows multimedia frames (data) to be sent as soon as they are generated, so that the multimedia frames can reach the destination as quickly as possible, in order to provide an isochronous interactive service. This is done by maintaining the Packet Rate of the Congestion Control Mechanism (CCM) at a level equivalent to the Frame Rate of the Multimedia Encoder. The response to congestion is to truncate the Packet Size, hence reducing the overall bitrate of the multimedia stream. This functionality of the Congestion Control Mechanism is referred to as Packet Size Truncation (PST), and takes advantage of adaptive multimedia encoding, such as Fine Grain Scalable (FGS), where the <b>multimedia</b> <b>frame</b> is encoded in order of significance, Most to Least Significant Bits. The Multimedia Adaptation Manager (MAM) truncates the <b>multimedia</b> <b>frame</b> to the size indicated by the Packet Size Truncation function of the CCM, accurately mapping user demand to available network resource. Additionally Fine Grain Scalable encoding can offer scalability at byte level granularity, providing a true match to available network resources. This approach has the benefits of achieving a ‘fair-share’ of network resource when competing with responsive flows (as similar to TFRC CCM), but it also provides an isochronous service which is of crucial benefit to real-time interactive services. Furthermore, results illustrate that an increased number of interactive multimedia flows (such as voice) can be carried over congested networks whilst maintaining a quality level equivalent to that of a standard landline telephone. This is because the loss and delay arising from the buffering of frames at the Sender Buffer is completely removed. Packets sent maintain a fixed inter-packet-gap-spacing (IPGS). This results in a majority of packets arriving at the receiving end at tight time intervals. Hence, this avoids the need of using large Playout (de-jitter) Buffer sizes and adaptive Playout Buffer configurations. As a result this reduces delay, improves interactivity and Quality of Experience (QoE) of the multimedia application. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|New TCP-friendly {{constraints}} require multimedia {{flows to}} reduce their data rates under packet loss {{to that of a}} conformant TCP flow. To reduce data rates while preserving real-time playout, temporal scaling can be used to discard the encoded <b>multimedia</b> <b>frames</b> that have the least impact on perceived video quality. To limit the impact of lost packets, Forward Error Correction (FEC) can be used to repair frames damaged by packet loss. However, adding FEC requires further reduction of multimedia data, making the decision of how much FEC to use of critical importance. Current approaches use either inflexible FEC patterns or adapt to packet loss on the network without regard to TCP-friendly data rate constraints. In this article, we analytically model the playable frame rate of a TCP-friendly MPEG stream with FEC and temporal scaling, capturing the impact of distributing FEC within MPEG frame types with interframe dependencies. For a given network condition and MPEG video encoding, we use our model to exhaustively search for the optimal combination of FEC and temporal scaling that yields the highest playable frame rate within TCP-friendly constraints. Analytic experiments over a range of network and application conditions indicate that adjustable FEC with temporal scaling can provide a significant performance improvement over current approaches. Extensive simulation experiments based on Internet traces show that our model can be effective as part of a streaming protocol that chooses FEC and temporal scaling patterns that meet dynamically-changing application and network conditions...|$|R

40|$|I/O has {{traditionally}} been a limiting factor {{in the performance of}} modern high-performance computer systems consisting of CPUs, memories, secondary storage devices, user interfaces, and the network. This I/O bottleneck becomes even more pronounced for currently evolving systems handling digital multimedia, such as audio and video data. In this dissertation, we study the characteristics of multimedia data, and based on these characteristics, we study and develop efficient techniques for the storage and synchronous retrieval of such data. We propose methods to quantify user perceived quality via QOP (quality of presentation) parameters. We combine QOP and OCPN (object composition petri-net) multimedia data modeling techniques to develop techniques to allow efficient synchronous retrieval of multimedia data. Since I/O bandwidth is a precious resource, we develop methods for the allocation of I/O bandwidth among several concurrent multimedia I/O streams. These methods are fair among users and make judicious utilization of the I/O bandwidth. ^ Inter-media and intra-media temporal synchronization at the user-interaction level is an essential concern in multimedia systems. In order to effect such synchronization, we propose several O(n n + mn) (where m is the number of logical I/O channels and n is the number of <b>frames</b> of <b>multimedia</b> data) heuristics to schedule <b>multimedia</b> <b>frames</b> between the disks and destination memories of the multimedia systems. We study the performance of these heuristics via simulations and show the tradeoffs between the system resources, such as memory, and QOP parameters. Finally, we identify promising avenues for future advances in multimedia I/O. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Perceptual {{multimedia}} {{quality is}} {{of paramount importance}} to the continued take-up and proliferation of multimedia applications: users will not use and pay for applications if they are perceived to be of low quality. Whilst traditionally distributed multimedia quality has been characterised by Quality of Service (QoS) parameters, these neglect the user perspective of the issue of quality. In order to redress this shortcoming, we characterise the user multimedia perspective using the Quality of Perception (QoP) metric, which encompasses not only a user’s satisfaction with the quality of a multimedia presentation, but also his/her ability to analyse, synthesise and assimilate informational content of multimedia. In recognition of the fact that monitoring eye movements offers insights into visual perception, as well as the associated attention mechanisms and cognitive processes, this paper reports on the results of a study investigating the impact of differing <b>multimedia</b> presentation <b>frame</b> rates on user QoP and eye path data. Our results show that provision of higher frame rates, usually assumed to provide better multimedia presentation quality, do not significantly impact upon the median coordinate value of eye path data. Moreover, higher frame rates do not significantly increase level of participant information assimilation, although they do significantly improve overall user enjoyment and quality perception of the multimedia content being shown...|$|R
