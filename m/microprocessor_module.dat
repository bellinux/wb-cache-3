Class A, low speed (less than 10 Kb/s) for convenience features such as body and comfort. Class B, medium speed (between 10 and 125 Kb/s) for general information transfer, such as emission data, instrumentation. Class C, high speed (greater than 125 Kb/s) for real-time control such as traction control, brake by wire, etc. 1. 1 Class	A Class A is the first SAE classification and maintains the lowest data rate, a rate that peaks as high as 10 Kb/s and must support event-driven message transmission. Usage is for low-end, non-emission diagnostic, general purpose communication. The implementation of Class A has significantly reduced the bulk of automotive wiring harnesses.
