5000|$|... "No Quarter" [...] was {{recorded}} in 1972 at Island Studios, London. It was engineered by Andy Johns and also mixed by Johns at Olympic Studios, London. The version that made it onto the album evolved out of a faster version Led Zeppelin had recorded earlier at Headley Grange, an old mansion in East Hampshire, England. Jimmy Page applied vari-speed to drop the whole song a semi-tone, {{in order to give}} it a thicker and more intense mood. In addition to the pitch change, the album version featured a very highly compressed guitar track, giving it a tone unique to Led Zeppelin. The effect is achievable today by means of running a dry signal through circuitry, at a much higher amplitude than the device is rated to handle. This phenomenon is commonly observed in Fostex and similar <b>multi-channel</b> <b>recording</b> equipment, dating back to the early 2000s. Likely a by-product of Page's compression, there are radar needles throughout the guitar track. Very little is known to the exact origin of the tone Page used, or how/why it was done. The guitar solo effect was achieved by direct injection and compression. The song features a brief Shepard scale {{at the close of the}} solo section at around the 4:45 mark. With his electric piano, John Paul Jones achieved a Fender Rhodes-like oscillator effect, as well as a real-time bass synth line, done on early Moog Taurus foot pedals in sequence with the keyboard track, which requires an amount of dexterity. Along with full-range intonation, the depression-sensitive bass pedals were then able to be modulated in-time with the riff, opening up the filter cut-off, rhythmically, judging by the amount the pedal is depressed. The result is a swampy, hollow, and deep bass sound, which was also compressed in the final cut.|$|E

The algorithm resembles the wavelet packet transform by its binary tree search for an optimal selection of orthogonal basis, but extends the application lo the multi-channel scenario.
