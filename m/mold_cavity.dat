5|$|Die casting is a {{metal casting}} {{process that is}} {{characterized}} by forcing molten metal under high pressure into a <b>mold</b> <b>cavity.</b> The <b>mold</b> <b>cavity</b> is created using two hardened tool steel dies which have been machined into shape and work similarly to an injection mold during the process. Most die castings are made from non-ferrous metals, specifically zinc, copper, aluminium, magnesium, lead, pewter and tin-based alloys. Depending {{on the type of}} metal being cast, a hot- or cold-chamber machine is used.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{solvent-based}} lubricants, such as {{diesel fuel}} and kerosene, were commonly used. These were good at releasing the {{part from the}} dies, but a small explosion occurred during each shot, {{which led to a}} build-up of carbon on the <b>mold</b> <b>cavity</b> walls. However, they were easier to apply evenly than water-based lubricants.|$|E
5|$|When no {{porosity}} {{is allowed}} {{in a cast}} part then the pore-free casting process is used. It {{is identical to the}} standard process except oxygen is injected into the die before each shot to purge any air from the <b>mold</b> <b>cavity.</b> This causes small dispersed oxides to form when the molten metal fills the die, which virtually eliminates gas porosity. An added advantage to this is greater strength. Unlike standard die castings, these castings can be heat treated and welded. This process can be performed on aluminium, zinc, and lead alloys.|$|E
50|$|Gates: The {{controlled}} entrances {{from the}} runners into the <b>mold</b> <b>cavities.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{metal casting}} processes, surface {{tension of the}} molten metal {{typically}} resists filling of the metal into the mold. The effects are greater for smaller <b>mold</b> <b>cavities,</b> and ultimately, the smallest cavities may not be filled. Surface tension forces can be overcome by applying pressure (head) to the molten metal, thus forcing metal into the cavities. However, a pressure-window will exist, too little pressure resulting in non-filled cavities and too much pressure resulting in penetration of the mold, which is itself porous. Filling-pressure windows are investigated for cylindrical-shaped <b>mold</b> <b>cavities</b> on both a theoretical and experimental basis. The lower bound of the filling pressure window is examined by treating cylindrical <b>mold</b> <b>cavities</b> as cylinders lined with packed spheres representing mold particles. The upper bound is examined by treating the mold as a 3 -D array of close-packed spheres. The experimental work concerns industrial-scale vacuum investment casting of superalloy IN 718 into molds containing various cylindrical <b>mold</b> <b>cavities</b> at various heights (heads). The experimental results {{are found to be}} in good agreement with the numerical modeling predictions for filling of rough (sphere-lined) cylindrical <b>mold</b> <b>cavities.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|External chills are {{masses of}} {{material}} that have a high heat capacity and thermal conductivity. They are placed {{on the edge of}} the <b>molding</b> <b>cavity,</b> and effectively become part of the wall of the <b>molding</b> <b>cavity.</b> This type of chill can be used to increase the feeding distance of a riser or reduce the number of risers required.|$|R
25|$|Pouring - The mold is {{securely}} {{clamped together}} while the molten metal is poured from a ladle into the gating system and fills the <b>mold</b> <b>cavity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pouring metal defects include misruns, cold shuts, and inclusions. A misrun {{occurs when}} the liquid metal does not {{completely}} fill the <b>mold</b> <b>cavity,</b> leaving an unfilled portion. Cold shuts occur when two fronts of liquid metal do not fuse properly in the <b>mold</b> <b>cavity,</b> leaving a weak spot. Both are caused by either a lack of fluidity in the molten metal or cross-sections that are too narrow. The fluidity can be increased by changing the chemical composition of the metal or by increasing the pouring temperature. Another possible cause is back pressure from improperly vented mold cavities.|$|E
25|$|In casting and molding {{the threads}} are {{directly}} {{formed by the}} geometry of the <b>mold</b> <b>cavity</b> in the mold or die. When the material freezes in the mold, it retains the shape after the mold is removed. The material is heated to a liquid, or mixed with a liquid that will either dry or cure (such as plaster or cement). Alternately, the material may be forced into a mold as a powder and compressed into a solid, as with graphite.|$|E
2500|$|One key in casting metal cores is to {{make sure}} they do not contain any {{porosity}} as it will induce flaws into the molded part. In order to minimize porosity the metal may be gravity cast or the <b>molding</b> <b>cavity</b> may be pressurized. Another system slowly rocks the casting dies as the <b>molding</b> <b>cavity</b> fills to [...] "shake" [...] the air bubbles out.|$|R
50|$|Gating system: The {{network of}} {{connected}} channels that deliver the molten {{material to the}} <b>mold</b> <b>cavities.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{connection}} of the riser to the <b>molding</b> <b>cavity</b> {{can be an}} issue for side risers. On one hand the connection should be as small as possible to make separation as easy as possible, but, on the other, the connection must be big enough for it to not solidify before the riser. The connection is usually made short {{to take advantage of}} the heat of both the riser and the <b>molding</b> <b>cavity,</b> which will keep it hot throughout the process.|$|R
25|$|In 1969, Bayer {{exhibited}} an all-plastic car in Düsseldorf, Germany. Parts of this car, {{such as the}} fascia {{and body}} panels, were manufactured using a new process called reaction injection molding (RIM), in which the reactants were mixed and then injected into a mold. The addition of fillers, such as milled glass, mica, and processed mineral fibres, gave rise to reinforced RIM (RRIM), which provided improvements in flexural modulus (stiffness), reduction in {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} and better thermal stability.This technology was used to make the first plastic-body automobile in the United States, the Pontiac Fiero, in 1983. Further increases in stiffness were obtained by incorporating pre-placed glass mats into the RIM <b>mold</b> <b>cavity,</b> also known broadly as resin injection molding, or structural RIM.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{difficulties}} that result from these long development times and high costs is making accurate cores repeatably. This is extremely important because the core {{is an integral part}} of the mold, so essentially each shot is into a new <b>mold</b> <b>cavity.</b> Another difficulty is keeping the core from melting when the plastic is shot into the mold, because the plastic is approximately twice the melting temperature of the core material. A third difficulty is the low strength of the core. Hollow plastic cores can collapse if too much pressure is used in the shot plastic. Metal cores (with low melting temperatures) are solid so they cannot collapse, but are only 10% as strong as steel cores so they can distort. This is especially a problem when molding manifolds, because the waviness of the core can be detrimental to the airflow within the runners.|$|E
25|$|Misruns {{and cold}} shuts {{are closely related}} and both involve the {{material}} freezing before it completely fills the <b>mold</b> <b>cavity.</b> These types of defects are serious because the area surrounding the defect is significantly weaker than intended. The castability and viscosity of the material can be important factors with these problems. Fluidity affects the minimum section thickness that can be cast, the maximum length of thin sections, fineness of feasibly cast details, and the accuracy of filling mold extremities. There are various ways of measuring the fluidity of a material, although it usually involves using a standard mould shape and measuring the distance the material flows. Fluidity {{is affected by the}} composition of the material, freezing temperature or range, surface tension of oxide films, and, most importantly, the pouring temperature. The higher the pouring temperature, the greater the fluidity; however, excessive temperatures can be detrimental, leading to a reaction between the material and the mold; in casting processes that use a porous mould material the material may even penetrate the mould material.|$|E
40|$|Layered {{compaction}} manufacturing (LCM), {{which is}} a hybrid process of powder compaction and milling in layers, {{is applied to the}} fabrication of a cemented carbide mold (WC– 9 mass%Co) for the forming of optical glass lenses with internal cooling channels, which are placed along the <b>molding</b> <b>cavity.</b> The <b>mold</b> is produced by repeating the process of powder compaction with the subsequent creation of grooves filled with paraffin wax as a sacrificial material. The channels placed along the <b>molding</b> <b>cavity</b> are formed during the sintering process by dewaxing. In the sintering process, the extent of deformation {{in the shape of the}} internal channels and <b>molding</b> <b>cavity</b> is measured. It is found that the shapes of the channels and cavity exhibit uniform linear shrinkage in the range from 17 to 19 %. By filling the <b>molding</b> <b>cavity</b> with epoxy resin, the cooling capability of the mold by air is investigated by performing experiments as well as two-dimensional finite differences simulation. The cooling effect of the mold in the glass lens-forming process is also estimated by the simulation. For both resin and glass, when air is supplied to the channels, the obtained cooling rate is approximately ten times higher as compared to natural cooling at an ambient temperature...|$|R
40|$|The method {{involves}} introducing reinforcement fibers (5) e. g. synthetic fibers, in a <b>molding</b> <b>cavity</b> of <b>molding</b> tools (2, 3), {{and filling}} the <b>molding</b> <b>cavity</b> with a thermal activatable resin system under complete wetting of the reinforcement fibers. The resin system is pre-hardened {{in one of}} the molding tools to form a dimensionally stable preform part (6 a). The preform part is transferred to the other molding tool and completely hardened in the latter tool to form a finished fiber reinforced polymer mold part (6 b), where the former tool is made of electromagnetic radiation permeable material...|$|R
25|$|Evaporative-pattern casting {{is a type}} {{of casting}} process that uses a pattern made from a {{material}} that will evaporate when the molten metal is poured into the <b>molding</b> <b>cavity.</b> The most common evaporative-pattern material used is polystyrene foam.|$|R
500|$|Two dies {{are used}} in die casting; one is called the [...] "cover die half" [...] and the other the [...] "ejector die half". Where they meet is called the parting line. The cover die {{contains}} the sprue (for hot-chamber machines) or shot hole (for cold-chamber machines), which allows the molten metal to flow into the dies; this feature matches up with the injector nozzle on the hot-chamber machines or the shot chamber in the cold-chamber machines. The ejector die contains the ejector pins and usually the runner, which is the path from the sprue or shot hole to the <b>mold</b> <b>cavity.</b> The cover die is secured to the stationary, or front, platen of the casting machine, while the ejector die {{is attached to the}} movable platen. The <b>mold</b> <b>cavity</b> is cut into two cavity inserts, which are separate pieces that can be replaced relatively easily and bolt into the die halves.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} are the four steps in traditional die casting, also known as , these are also the basis {{for any of the}} die casting variations: die preparation, filling, ejection, and shakeout. The dies are prepared by spraying the <b>mold</b> <b>cavity</b> with lubricant. The lubricant both helps control the temperature of the die and it also assists in the removal of the casting. The dies are then closed and molten metal is injected into the dies under high pressure; between [...] Once the <b>mold</b> <b>cavity</b> is filled, the pressure is maintained until the casting solidifies. The dies are then opened and the shot (shots are different from castings because there can be multiple cavities in a die, yielding multiple castings per shot) is ejected by the ejector pins. Finally, the shakeout involves separating the scrap, which includes the gate, runners, sprues and flash, from the shot. This is often done using a special trim die in a power press or hydraulic press. Other methods of shaking out include sawing and grinding. A less labor-intensive method is to tumble shots if gates are thin and easily broken; separation of gates from finished parts must follow. This scrap is recycled by remelting it. The yield is approximately 67%.|$|E
2500|$|A major {{application}} of polycarbonate is {{the production of}} Compact Discs, DVDs, and Blu-ray Discs. [...] These discs are produced by injection molding polycarbonate into a <b>mold</b> <b>cavity</b> that has on one side a metal stamper containing a negative image of the disc data, while the other mold side is a mirrored surface.|$|E

40|$|Homogenous {{pressure}} distribution {{within the}} <b>molding</b> <b>cavity</b> {{is of particular}} importance for encapsulation of mechanically-sensitive electronic components, e. g., MEMS sensors, bare dies and flip chips. With the implementation of specially multilayered sensor films, a fast estimation of the pressure distribution within the cavity will be possible...|$|R
50|$|Risers are {{classified}} by three criteria. The first {{is if the}} riser {{is open to the}} atmosphere, if it is then it is called an open riser, otherwise it is known as a blind type. The second criterion is where the riser is located; if it is located on the casting then it is known as a top riser and if it is located next to the casting it is known as a side riser. Finally, if the riser is located on the gating system so that it fills after the <b>molding</b> <b>cavity,</b> it is known as a live riser or hot riser, but if the riser fills with materials that have already flowed through the <b>molding</b> <b>cavity</b> it is known as a dead riser or cold riser.|$|R
2500|$|Replicated CDs are mass-produced {{initially}} using {{a hydraulic}} press. Small granules of heated raw polycarbonate plastic are {{fed into the}} press. A screw forces the liquefied plastic into the <b>mold</b> <b>cavity.</b> The mold closes with a metal stamper {{in contact with the}} disc surface. The plastic is allowed to cool and harden. Once opened, the disc substrate is removed from the mold by a robotic arm, and a 15mm diameter center hole (called a stacking ring) is created. The time it takes to [...] "stamp" [...] one CD is usually two to three seconds.|$|E
50|$|Fill the <b>mold</b> <b>cavity</b> with molten metal.|$|E
50|$|The <b>mold</b> <b>cavity</b> of {{a casting}} {{does not reflect}} the exact {{dimensions}} of the finished part due to a number of reasons. These modifications to the <b>mold</b> <b>cavity</b> are known as allowances and account for patternmaker's shrinkage, draft, machining, and distortion. In non-expendable processes, these allowances are imparted directly into the permanent mold, but in expendable mold processes they are imparted into the patterns, which later form the <b>mold</b> <b>cavity.</b> Note that for non-expendable molds an allowance is required for the dimensional change of the mold due to heating to operating temperatures.|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} focused on the study of thermal stress of surface of <b>mold</b> <b>cavities</b> and parting line of {{silicone}} molds after pouring. The silicone mold White SD - THT was thermally stressed by pouring of ZnAl 4 Cu 3 zinc alloy with pouring cycle 20, 30 and 40 seconds. The most thermally stressed part of surface at each pouring cycle is gating system and <b>mold</b> <b>cavities.</b> It could be further concluded that linear increase of the pouring cycle time leads to the exponential increasing of the maximum temperature of mold surface after its cooling. The elongated pouring cycle increases the temperature accumulated on the surface of cavities and the ability of silicone mold to conduct the heat on its surface decreases, because the low thermal conductivity of silicone molds enables the conduction of larger amount of heat into ambient environment...|$|R
50|$|Internal chills are {{pieces of}} metal that are placed inside the <b>molding</b> <b>cavity.</b> When the cavity is filled, part of the chill will melt and {{ultimately}} {{become part of the}} casting, thus the chill must be the same material as the casting. Note that internal chills will absorb both heat capacity and heat of fusion energy.|$|R
30|$|Injection molds {{were widely}} used for mass {{production}} of thermoplastic parts {{with a high}} production efficiency [1]. The quality of injection production {{is related to the}} mold steel materials [2] and the structure [3, 4]. Particularly, cooling channels in molds greatly affect the productivity, product deformation and die life [5, 6]. Conventional straight-line channels easily cause a heterogeneous heat dissipation and cooling due to the inconsistency between channels and <b>mold</b> <b>cavities.</b> Moreover, the heterogeneous cooling will increase the cooling time [7], even result in some defects such as part warping and sink marks [2, 8]. By contrast, the emerging conformal cooling channels that conform to <b>mold</b> <b>cavities</b> can bring into a steady and homogeneous heat transfer from the cavity surfaces to the coolant, which improves directly the product quality [9]. However, it is difficult to fabricate molds with conformal cooling channels by traditional manufacturing techniques, such as machining, and electrical discharge machining (EDM).|$|R

Most die castings {{are made from}} nonferrous metals, specifically zinc, copper, and aluminium-based alloys, but ferrous metal die castings are possible. The die casting method is especially suited for applications where many small to medium-sized parts are needed with good detail, a fine surface quality and dimensional consistency.|$|R
50|$|A Chill is {{an object}} {{used to promote}} {{solidification}} in a specific portion of a metal casting mold. Normally the metal in the mold cools at a certain rate relative to thickness of the casting. When the geometry of the <b>molding</b> <b>cavity</b> prevents directional solidification from occurring naturally, a chill can be strategically placed to help promote it. There {{are two types of}} chills: internal and external chills.|$|R
5000|$|Steel is more {{difficult}} to cast than iron. It has a higher melting point and greater shrinkage rate, which requires consideration during mold design. Risers should be given more capacity to draw from as the metal cools and shrinks. Attention should be paid to the thickness of <b>mold</b> <b>cavities,</b> as thinner areas will cool quicker than thicker areas, which can create internal stress points that can lead to fracture.|$|R
