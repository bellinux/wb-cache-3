25|$|The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority {{has begun}} to {{gradually}} phase out the <b>mobile</b> <b>lounge</b> system for inter-terminal passenger movements {{in favor of the}} AeroTrain, an underground people mover which currently operates to Concourses A, B and C, as well as underground pedestrian walkway tunnels (now in service to concourse A/B). The mobile lounges are still used to transport passengers directly from the main terminal to Concourse D. Plane mates also remain in use to disembark international passengers and carry them to the International Arrivals Building, as well as to convey passengers to and from aircraft on hard stand (i.e., those parked remotely on the apron without access to jet bridges).|$|E
25|$|Concourse C {{also has}} a {{dedicated}} Federal Inspection Station located at ground level. International United flights not originating at an airport with US customs preclearance can directly deplane passengers via jetbridge at Concourse C (as opposed to using plane mates to offload passengers). Once deplaned, arriving passengers are separated. Passengers terminating at Dulles take a <b>mobile</b> <b>lounge</b> that transports them to the International Arrivals Building, while connecting passengers continuing on another United flight go through U.S. Customs and Immigration at the FIS station on the ground level. Since this immigration facility is only for connecting passengers on United and other Star Alliance carriers, it has shorter lines and passengers don't have to reclear security at the massive security checkpoints in the main terminal.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{development}} plan, future phases {{would see the}} addition of several new midfield concourses and a new south terminal. A fourth runway (parallel to the existing runways 1 and 19 L) opened in 2008, and development plans include a fifth runway to parallel the existing runway 12–30. If this runway is built, the current runway will be redesignated as 12L-30R while the new runway will be designated 12R-30L. An expansion of the B concourse, used by many low cost airlines as well as international arrivals, has been completed, and the building housing Concourses C and D will eventually be knocked down {{to make room for}} a more ergonomic building. Because Concourses C and D are temporary concourses, {{the only way to get}} to those concourses is via moving walkway from the Concourse C station which is built in the location of the future gates and Concourse D by <b>mobile</b> <b>lounge</b> from the main terminal.|$|E
25|$|A new train system, dubbed AeroTrain and {{developed}} by Mitsubishi, began in 2010 to transport passengers between the concourses {{and the main}} terminal. The system, which uses rubber tires and travels along a fixed underground guideway, {{is similar to the}} people mover systems at Singapore Changi Airport, Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport, and Denver International Airport. The train is intended to replace the <b>mobile</b> <b>lounges,</b> which many passengers found crowded and inconvenient. The initial phase includes the main terminal station, a permanent Concourse A station, a permanent Concourse B station, a permanent midfield concourse station (with access to the current temporary C concourse via a tunnel with moving walkways), and a maintenance facility. <b>Mobile</b> <b>lounges</b> continue to service the D Concourse from both the main terminal and Concourse A. Even after AeroTrain is built out and the replacement Concourses C and D are built, the <b>mobile</b> <b>lounges</b> and plane mates will still continue to be used, to transport international arriving passengers to the International Arrivals Building, as well as transport passengers to aircraft parked on hardstands without direct access to jet bridges. Dulles has stated that the wait time for a train does not exceed four minutes, compared to the average 15-minute wait and travel time for <b>mobile</b> <b>lounges.</b>|$|R
25|$|By the 1980s the {{original}} design, which had <b>mobile</b> <b>lounges</b> meet each plane, {{was no longer}} well-suited to Dulles' role as a hub airport. Instead, midfield concourses were added to allow passengers to walk between connecting flights without visiting the main terminal. <b>Mobile</b> <b>lounges</b> were still used for international flights and to transport passengers between the midfield concourses and the main terminal. An underground tunnel (consisting of a passenger walkway and moving sidewalks) which links the main terminal and Concourse B was opened in 2004. The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) began a renovation program for the airport including a new security mezzanine with more room for lines.|$|R

2500|$|Conceived {{in early}} {{planning}} sessions in 1959, Dulles {{is one of}} the few remaining airports to use the <b>mobile</b> <b>lounge</b> (also known as [...] "plane mates" [...] or [...] "people movers") for boarding and disembarkation from aircraft, and to transfer passengers between the midfield concourses and to and from the main terminal building. They have all been given names based on the postal abbreviations of 50 states, e.g., VA, MD, AK.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the 1960s and 1970s several {{attempts}} were made to codify the perimeter rule, but it wasn't until Dulles was endangered that it actually become a [...] "rule". In 1970, the FAA lifted the ban at National on the stretch version of the Boeing 727, which resulted in a lawsuit by Virginias for Dulles who argued that the airport's jet traffic was a nuisance. That suit resulted in a Court of Appeals order to create an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). In addition the court order, there were economic problems at Dulles. Following the extension of Metrorail to National in 1977, and airline deregulation in 1978, traffic at Dulles began to plummet while it increased at National. As part of a slate of efforts to protect Dulles, including removing landing fees and <b>mobile</b> <b>lounge</b> user charges, the FAA proposed regulations as part of the EIS to limit traffic at National and maintain Dulles' role as the area's airport serving long-haul destinations. [...] In 1980, the FAA proposed codifying the perimeter rule {{as part of a larger}} rulemaking effort. When the rule was announced, airlines reacted by challenging it in court and, in some cases, scheduling flights beyond the perimeter, to Dallas and Houston, thereby breaking the voluntary agreement. To prevent this, the Metropolitan Washington Airports Policy of 1981 codified the perimeter rule on an interim basis [...] "to maintain the long-haul nonstop service at Dulles and BWI which otherwise would preempt shorter haul service at National." [...] At the same time, the perimeter was extended to 1000 miles to remove the unfairness of having seven grandfathered cities. The perimeter rule was upheld by the Court of Appeals in 1982. In 1986, as part of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Act which handed control of National over to the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, the perimeter was extended to 1250 miles to enable direct flights to Houston.|$|E

50|$|The <b>mobile</b> <b>lounge</b> was an {{innovative}} {{feature of the}} Washington Dulles terminal design by Eero Saarinen. Saarinen promoted the <b>mobile</b> <b>lounge</b> concept with a short animated film by Charles and Ray Eames. Dulles Airport was {{the realization of the}} concepts expressed in the film. Dulles' designers thought that by shuttling from the main terminal directly to a midfield jet ramp, they could save passengers from long walking distances amidst weather, noise, and fumes on the ramp. The advent of the jet bridge and construction of the two midfield concourse buildings at this airport negated the benefits of the system.|$|E
5000|$|AeroTrain is a 3.78 mi {{underground}} {{people mover}} system at Washington Dulles International Airport. It {{was scheduled to}} open in fall 2009, but was delayed until 2010 in order to complete reliability tests. [...] It opened to Dulles employees on January 20, 2010, and opened to passengers January 26, 2010. [...] The system mostly replaced the <b>mobile</b> <b>lounges</b> that transport passengers from the concourses to the Main Terminal. The system cost about $1.4 billion and also includes a new security screening mezzanine. The system utilizes 29 Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Crystal Mover vehicles as its rolling stock.|$|R
5000|$|The AeroTrain {{transports}} passengers {{between the}} Main Terminal building and Concourses A, B and C. From the Main Terminal Station, trains travel to Concourse A and Concourse C in one direction, and Concourse B {{in the other}} direction. The track map for AeroTrain is shaped like a fishhook, with the Main Terminal station at the bottom. The Aerotrain runs 4 three-car trains from 5:00 AM to around 3:00 PM from which seven three-car trains run from 3:00 PM until 11:00 PM. From midnight to 5 AM there are usually two three-car trains but sometimes only one three-car train. There {{are supposed to be}} no more than two minutes between trains, and trains transport passengers to the concourses in about two minutes, at 40-42 miles per hour (the <b>mobile</b> <b>lounges</b> travel about fifteen miles per hour).|$|R
50|$|After airline {{deregulation}} in 1978, airlines {{began to}} realign their operations around a hub and spoke model. Trans World Airlines (TWA) was headquartered in New York City but it's main base of employment was at Kansas City International Airport and had large operations at Chicago O'Hare International Airport {{as well as}} St. Louis. TWA deemed Kansas City terminals as unsuitable {{to serve as a}} primary hub. TWA reluctantly ruled out Chicago, as its Chicago operation was already losing $25 million a year under competition from American Airlines and United Airlines. This meant that St. Louis was the carrier's only viable option. TWA proceeded to downsize Chicago and build up St. Louis, swapping three Chicago gates for five of American's St. Louis gates. By December 1982, St. Louis accounted for 20% of TWA's domestic capacity. Lambert's terminal was initially too small for this operation, and TWA was forced to use temporary terminals, <b>mobile</b> <b>lounges</b> and airstairs to handle the additional flights. After Concourse D was completed in 1985, TWA began transatlantic service from Lambert to London, Frankfurt and Paris.|$|R
50|$|Eventually Soviet {{officials}} allowed Vlasova {{to speak}} with U.S. representatives in a <b>mobile</b> <b>lounge</b> that was brought up to the plane. She convinced them {{that she was not}} returning under coercion, and the plane took off with Vlasova on board.|$|E
50|$|Both midfield {{terminals}} at Washington Dulles International Airport {{use this}} design, with Concourses A, B, and C being {{connected to the}} main terminal by the AeroTrain, and Concourse D via a <b>mobile</b> <b>lounge</b> service. There is also an underground walkway from the main terminal to Concourse B.|$|E
50|$|One rarer {{terminal}} {{design is}} the <b>mobile</b> <b>lounge,</b> where passengers are transported {{from the gate}} to their aircraft in a large vehicle which docks directly to the terminal and the aircraft. Washington Dulles International Airport, Mexico City International Airport, and Mirabel International Airport have used this design.|$|E
50|$|Customer {{services}} and amenities include a Wells Fargo ATM, a children's play area, an electric vehicle charging station, FedEx and UPS drop off centers, foreign currency exchange, a lost and found, various <b>lounges,</b> <b>mobile</b> charging stations across the mall, and valet parking.|$|R

50|$|Early in {{the space}} shuttle program, NASA used the Plane Mate system of <b>mobile</b> <b>lounge</b> to move astronauts {{directly}} from the orbiter to crew facilities. A modified vehicle obtained from Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport in Baltimore, Maryland was used for shuttle landings at Edwards Air Force Base. A similar vehicle was used at the Kennedy Space Center to take astronauts directly from the orbiter to the Operations and Checkout building, where the vehicle was again lifted up for the astronauts to exit directly onto the 2nd floor of the facility.|$|E

50|$|The <b>mobile</b> <b>lounge</b> is used at Washington Dulles International Airport in Washington, D.C. and at Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport Montreal. The {{system was}} also used at Montreal Mirabel International Airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport's International Terminal in New York City, Mexico City Airport until 2007, and Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris before the 1990s and at King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah until 1994. While it is still used at Dulles Airport, the growth in {{passenger}} ridership made it impractical to use mobile lounges for individual flights. Remote concourses were constructed, and the fleet of mobile lounges {{was used as a}} shuttle between the concourses and the main terminal. On January 26, 2010, the MWAA replaced the Dulles <b>mobile</b> <b>lounge</b> system for passenger movements between the Main Terminal and the A-, B-, and C-Gates with the underground AeroTrain. However, some mobile lounges and plane mates remain in use for passenger movements between the main terminal and Concourse D (until the replacement Concourses C and D are built and the AeroTrain is built out to run in a continuous two-way loop), to disembark international passengers from all arriving international aircraft (with the exception of United Airlines and certain Star Alliance flights, which are directly serviced at Concourse C's Federal Inspection Station; and flights from airports with border preclearance) and carry them to the International Arrivals Building, and to convey passengers between the main terminal and aircraft on hard standing (i.e., those parked remotely on the tarmac without access to jet bridges).|$|E

5000|$|The Plane Mate is an {{evolutionary}} {{variation on the}} <b>mobile</b> <b>lounge</b> concept. They are similar in appearance to mobile lounges, but can raise themselves on screws (parts of which are contained {{in a pair of}} fin-like towers above the vehicles) to [...] "mate" [...] directly with an aircraft. These are used at Dulles and Dorval. This allows passengers to deplane directly aboard and be carried to the main terminal. They are easily identified by the different window configuration. More noticeably, plane mates have two short columns on the roof with yellow beacons mounted on the top, and have an accordion-like canopy at one end (similar to the canopy seen {{at the end of a}} jet bridge) and have only one driver's cab and one set of steering wheels at the canopy end.|$|E

5000|$|The Passenger Transfer Vehicle or Passenger Transport Vehicle (PTV) (<b>mobile</b> <b>lounge)</b> is a 54-by-16-foot {{carriage}} {{mounted on}} a scissor truck, capable of carrying 102 passengers. These vehicles were designed by the Chrysler Corporation {{in association with the}} Budd Company, and are sometimes nicknamed [...] "moon buggies" [...] due to their otherworldly appearance. When mobile lounges were first introduced, they had ramps at one end that could be raised or lowered to the floor height of an aircraft. However, after Dulles built the midfield concourses, some of the lounges were retrofitted to be used only for inter-terminal passenger transport. The ramps were removed and doors that could interlock with a terminal building were fitted to either end. Mobile lounges have a driver's cab at each end. The wheels {{at either end of the}} lounge can be steered, but the wheels at the end opposite the driver lock into a straight-ahead configuration so that the lounge is steered only by the forward driving wheels.|$|E
