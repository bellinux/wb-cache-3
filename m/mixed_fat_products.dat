Fat sources evaluated were soybean oil, a 85 % dry <b>fat</b> <b>product</b> composed of animal and vegetable fat, and a 80 % dry <b>fat</b> <b>product</b> made by encapsulating choice white grease with casein. The control diet was a 18 % crude protein corn-soybean meal diet with 10 % cornstarch. Fat sources {{were added to the}} basal diet at the expense of cornstarch to supply 8 % added fat. A crossover design was used with three pigs per diet in each of two periods. Digestibility of dry matter, energy, ether extract were (P<. 05) lower for the diet containing the 85 % dry <b>fat</b> <b>product.</b> Nitrogen digestibility and nitrogen retention were reduced also when the 85 % dry <b>fat</b> <b>product</b> was fed.

40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} effects of free access to reduced <b>fat</b> <b>products</b> or their full fat {{equivalents}} on fat and energy intake, body weight, plasma lipids and fat-soluble antioxidants concentrations and haemostasis variables. Design: A multicentre open randomised controlled trial in which intervention and control groups were followed in parallel for six months. Volunteers had free access to 44 different foods either in reduced fat or full fat version, covering between 30 and 40 % of energy intake. The remainder of energy intake was covered by foods bought in regular shops. Setting: Zeist, Wageningen and Maastricht, The Netherlands. Subjects: Two hundred and forty-one non-obese healthy volunteers who had no intention to lose weight. Main outcome measures: Food intake, body weight, plasma lipid, vitamin E, β-carotene, lycopene and fibrinogen concentrations, plasma factor VII clotting activity, and plasminogen-activator-inhibitor-I antigen level. Results: One hundred and three volunteers in the full fat group and 117 volunteers in the reduced fat group completed the study. Energy and fat intake from the free access products was lower in the reduced fat group, but no difference in energy and fat intake of other products occurred. Body weight, energy-, fat- and vitamin E intake and percentage of energy derived from fat decreased in the reduced fat group. No other statistical significant intervention effects were observed. Blood lipid concentrations, factor VII activity and plasminogen-inhibitor-activator- 1 level were reduced after consumption of reduced <b>fat</b> <b>products.</b> Conclusions: When subjects without intention to lose weight limit fat intake by switching from ad libitum consumption of full <b>fat</b> <b>products</b> to reduced <b>fat</b> <b>products</b> body weight gain is prevented, and fat and energy intake are reduced. Such a switch may have beneficial effects on biochemical cardiovascular risk factors. We concluded that reduced <b>fat</b> <b>products</b> will help in a population strategy aimed at preventing overweight and obesity, they will also be effective in maintaining a lower body weight after slimming. Ad libitum consumption of reduced <b>fat</b> <b>products</b> will be ineffective for those individuals that want to reduce body weight because they are currently overweight or obese.

40|$|The Nutrition Taskforce (1991) {{recommended}} {{strategies for}} the food industry {{in order to improve}} the diet of New Zealanders in line with the Food and Nutrition guidelines. Recommended strategies include, to produce low <b>fat</b> <b>products</b> and to disseminate nutrition information. This thesis examines the nature of current developments in low <b>fat</b> <b>products,</b> nutrition expertise in the industry and legislative requirements related to low <b>fat</b> <b>products.</b> Initially a survey of three supermarkets (Pak 'n' Sav, Foodtown and Woolworths) located at Palmerston North was carried out to examine the market availability of low <b>fat</b> dairy <b>products</b> and its labels. A detailed questionnaire based on product development, nutritional concerns and consumer issues was designed and mailed to 25 general food manufacturers, 11 responses (44 %) were obtained. Next, a postal survey to 26 dairy companies was done and 12 companies (46 %) responded. Some of the surveyed dairy companies (6) were interviewed to obtain in-depth information on survey findings. Currently a range of dairy <b>products</b> with lower <b>fat</b> contents are available in supermarket shelves, such as low fat versions of milk, yoghurt, cream, cheese and dairy desserts. Milk with fat content ranging from 0. 05 % to 3. 5 % fat is available. Most of the surveyed food manufacturers consider the development of <b>fat</b> reduced <b>products</b> as an important area of development. Maintaining the texture and flavour in developing <b>fat</b> reduced <b>products</b> was the main quality constraint in developing low <b>fat</b> <b>products.</b> Technical information could not be obtained in the survey due to confidentiality. The supermarket and food manufacturers surveys reveal that low <b>fat</b> <b>products</b> are targeted at women and health conscious people. However, some reduced <b>fat</b> <b>products</b> (reduced fat- milk, cheeses and dairy desserts) are most useful to consumers and some reduced <b>fat</b> <b>products</b> (reduced <b>fat</b> yoghurts) are less useful. Men may benefit the most by consuming reduced fat milk, cheeses and desserts. Older women may benefit by selecting reduced fat cream in the diet. Hence it is recommended that manufacturers should identify the need and accordingly target the products. From the survey results it can be concluded that consumer demand and an increase in diet and health awareness are the driving forces behind the development of new <b>fat</b> reduced <b>products.</b> In general, food companies view food regulations as difficult to interpret and restrictive. A standard format for labelling the additives and nutrients was not followed by the surveyed companies. Some manufacturers tend to use the labelling as a marketing advantage. Nutrition labelling was usually offered when a claim was made, however some cheese labels that made a claim did not carry nutrition labelling. Some companies claimed to be unable to offer nutrition labelling due to expense. A standard approach to labelling has been recommended by the Food Standards Committee and the proposed food regulations is hoped to eliminate consumer confusion over labels. Mostly the surveyed food manufacturers do not employ nutritionists and rely on people from various departments for nutrition decisions. Nutrition education is of primary importance within the food industry and a greater involvement of nutritionists in food product development and food marketing would be desirable. The Dairy Advisory Bureau, the Market Milk Federation (MMF) and the Ministry of Health are the main sources of nutrition information for dairy companies. Some companies perceive that nutrition information is not easily accessible. The MMF produces some nutrition education material, such as Milkwise snacks which are supplied by dairy companies to schools. Some surveyed companies are producing leaflets for consumers which do not contain much nutrition information and work more as promotion material for the products. In conclusion, the role of nutrition in product development and marketing of low <b>fat</b> <b>products</b> is discussed and a series of recommendations have been constructed...|$|R

40|$|The {{effective}} {{development of}} the Russian market of oil and <b>fat</b> <b>products,</b> {{as part of the}} food market, food security is an essential factor. Russia as a whole is fully self-sufficient in oil and it is a major exporter. Russia has the advantage that, in fact, all of its territory is suitable for cultivation of oilseed crops. In fact, in every region can grow oilseeds, which are in demand on the world market. Products include oil and <b>fat</b> industry for <b>products</b> deep processing and multi-functional. The peculiarity of the Russian market of oilseeds is the diversity of its constituent markets. The Russian market is represented by a different range of <b>fat</b> and oil <b>products</b> domestic and foreign manufacturers. In this market, working as large agricultural holdings and small manufacturers, and processors. The purpose of the study is to study on the basis of indicators that characterize {{the current state of the}} Russian market of oil and <b>fat</b> <b>products,</b> a comparison of the situation and of the experience of large processors, identify measures to further the efficient and competitive {{development of the}} market for the long term. The study used the abstract logic, monographic, economic and statistical methods. In a competitive environment, to stay on the market, Fat organizations form its structure in the form of vertical integration of multidisciplinary groups, in addition to processing plants that include agribusiness organization, logistics units – transportation, elevators, trading houses. For the development of the market of oil and <b>fat</b> <b>products</b> necessary to improve the competitiveness of domestic products, to revive production of traditional domestic oilseeds led to crop rotation, new, high-tech, innovative use of technology, to develop export, search for new markets. The results can then be used to develop long-term programs of development of regions.

Remarkable differences between fatty acid profiles of vegetable <b>fat</b> <b>products</b> were found. Vegetable fat ice creams may have a lot of saturated fat and, in addition, the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids may be very low. Vegetable fat half creams had, in general, less saturated fat and more polyunsaturated fatty acids than cream.

40|$|Until recently, {{the role}} of socio-regional context as a {{determinant}} of adolescents' health behaviour has been largely neglected in health studies. Usually {{the focus is on}} characteristics of individuals, while the potentially equally strong effect of the context is left unanalysed. Using multi-level data we studied whether socio-regional context influences health behaviour and whether it modifies differences by socio-economic background of adolescents. The individual level data derive from the (Finnish) Adolescent Health and Lifestyle Survey. In the survey, nationally representative data of 16 - and 18 -year old Finns were collected in 1991 and 1993 by mailed questionnaires (total n = 9121, response rate = 76 %). These data were linked with a database that included socio-economic characteristics of municipalities. Three dimensions of the socio-regional context were measured: level of services, occupational structure and self-sufficiency of employment. In a series of logistic regression models, factors related to daily smoking, weekly alcohol use, use of high milk <b>fat</b> <b>products</b> and frequent physical activity were analysed. Socio-economic background of the adolescent was a strong determinant of all four health behaviours. Drinking and use of high milk <b>fat</b> <b>products</b> were, however, also related to the socio-regional context. The relationship between socio-regional context and these behaviours was dissimilar, so that the dimensions of the socio-regional context that were related to the behaviours were different among boys than among girls. Our study shows that socio-regional context associates with adolescents' alcohol use and use of high milk <b>fat</b> <b>products,</b> while the more detailed nature of this relationship remains unclear. contextual analysis adolescents health behaviour socio-economic differences...|$|R

40|$|A major {{environmental}} problem in food, feed, and biodiesel industries {{is how to}} deal with their oily byproducts and wastes, which are in oily and viscous liquid form and easy to be rancid. There are many food, feed and biofuel processing plants in the US, which produce million tons of the oily byproducts and waste every year. The oily wastes are usually disposed onto or into land, which causes environmental pollution. Another way is to use heat and separate the wastes into low-value fat materials in paste form for feed applications. Unfortunately the process is not cost effective and does not cover the processing costs. Also the paste fat materials need to be heated into low-viscosity liquid before the applications, which need more energy to be used. Manufacturers prefer to dispose these wastes as a low cost method, which is not a long-term solution both practically and environmentally. We have developed two novel encapsulated processes to encapsulate the non-polar materials in liquid and oily form and to convert into the dry <b>fat</b> <b>products</b> in non-oily and free-flowing form and {{to increase the number of}} applications for such as (1) <b>fat</b> energy <b>products</b> in solid form for dairy, pork, poultry and aquaculture feeds; (2) a binder for heating processes and (3) a stabilizer in plastic <b>product</b> production. The <b>fat</b> <b>products</b> in solid form are easily handled, delivered and applied with significantly added value. If the proposed methodology is used for the industries to convert the oily wastes into the solid <b>fat</b> <b>products,</b> this would resolve above problem and add more than hundred millions/year. Our research and scale up were done. We filed patent applications after demonstrating the feasibility of the technologies. Then commercialization was done with related manufacturer and customers. Now our facility in MO produces the value-added product in dry non-oily and free-flowing form from the oily materials in liquid form for resolving the problems and economic development.

In the West Australian Raine Study, dairy intake was assessed using semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires in 860 adolescents at 14 and 17 -year follow-ups; 582 of these also had blood biochemistry at both points. Using generalized estimating equations, we examined associations with cardiometabolic risk factors. Models incorporated reduced fat and regular fat dairy together (in serves/day) and were adjusted for a range of factors including overall dietary pattern. In boys, there was a mean reduction in diastolic blood pressure of 0. 66 mmHg (95 % CI 0. 23 – 1. 09) per serve of reduced fat dairy and an independent, additional reduction of 0. 47 mmHg (95 % CI 0. 04 – 0. 90) per serve of regular fat dairy. Each additional serve of reduced fat dairy was associated with a 2 % reduction in HDL-cholesterol (95 % CI 0. 97 – 0. 995) and a 2 % increase in total: HDL-cholesterol ratio (95 % CI 1. 002 – 1. 03); these associations were not observed with regular <b>fat</b> <b>products.</b> In girls, there were no significant independent associations observed in fully adjusted models.
