25|$|The role of {{socioeconomic}} status in health equity extends beyond simple <b>monetary</b> <b>restrictions</b> on an individual's purchasing power. In fact, social capital plays {{a significant role}} in the health of individuals and their communities. It has been shown that those who are better connected to the resources provided by the individuals and communities around them (those with more social capital) live longer lives. The segregation of communities on the basis of income occurs in nations worldwide and has a significant impact on quality of health as a result of a decrease in social capital for those trapped in poor neighborhoods. Social interventions, which seek to improve healthcare by enhancing the social resources of a community, are therefore an effective component of campaigns to improve a community's health. A 1998 epidemiological study showed that community healthcare approaches fared far better than individual approaches in the prevention of heart disease mortality.|$|E

A number of websites were created to bypass <b>monetary</b> <b>restrictions</b> Valve set on the Steam marketplace to aid in high-value trading and allowing users to receive cash value for skins. Some of these sites subsequently added the ability to gamble on the results of professional matches or in games of chance with these skins, which in 2016 was estimated to handle around $5 billion of the virtual goods. These sites, along with Valve and various video game streamers, have come under scrutiny due to ethical and legal questions relating to gambling on sporting matches, underage gambling, undisclosed promotion, and outcome rigging. Evidence of such unethical practices was discovered in June 2016, and led to two formal lawsuits filed against these sites and Valve in the following month. Valve subsequently has taken steps to stop such sites from using Steam's interface for enabling gambling, leading to about half of these sites to close down, while driving more of the skin gambling into an underground economy.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{effectiveness}} of monetary policy actions in affecting the interest rate term structure. As a first approach, variations of the interest rate term structure in dates following a change in monetary policy stance are presented for the years 1998, 1999 and the first four months of 2000. Nevertheless, such variations in interest rates cannot be attributed solely to monetary policy decisions. This occurs since interest rates respond to various factors and events. Thus, it is important to decompose the effect of a change in monetary policy in two, a “reaction” (feedback) and an “active” (exogenous) component. Furthermore, the aim of this study is to analyze whether the increase in interest rates following a <b>monetary</b> <b>restriction</b> is due exclusively to changes in monetary policy (“active” monetary policy) or to events previously discounted by markets (“reaction” monetary policy).
