Things that <b>might</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> degree of finish achieved on a particular giornata include the heat and humidity of the day and the length of daylight hours. Whatever the reason for the difference is, a difference in approach to the light and shade on the individual figures is clearly apparent.|$|E
5|$|The River Slea {{through the}} town was {{converted}} into use as a canal {{for much of the}} 19th century. Plans to canalise it were drawn up in 1773, but faced opposition from land-owners who feared it <b>might</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> drainage of fens. Plans were approved in 1791 with the support of Brownlow Bertie, 5th Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven who owned estates and quarries that he hoped would benefit. An Act of Parliament passed in 1792, establishing the Sleaford Navigation, which opened two years later. After falling revenues due to competition from the railways, the navigation company closed in 1878. The river, although no longer navigable, passes under Carre Street and Southgate. The Nine Foot Drain, also unnavigable, meets the Slea just before Southgate.|$|E
5|$|Anjaana Anjaani {{film was}} {{initially}} slated to release on 24 September 2010. It was postponed by one week, {{just four days}} before the expected date because this would coincide with the controversial Ayodhya dispute verdict, which many anticipated would be disputed and cause chaos in the country. Trade experts were against postponing the film, and questioned Nadiadwala's decision, as the government had already taken precautionary measures with the Commonwealth Games around the corner. They also felt that the postponement would send mixed signals and confuse viewers as the promotional campaign centred around the 25 September release. Additionally, the film would lose the advantage of being the only new release. Changing the release date would mean Anjaana Anjaani would clash with the science fiction film Enthiran, which <b>might</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> film's box-office performance. Still, the film was postponed to 1 October 2010. Later, the Ayodhya verdict was itself postponed to three days before the film's new release date. Industry insiders started speculating again about the film's release being postponed by another week, causing rumours to spread in the media. However, Sajid Nadiadwla confirmed that the news was false and the film was releasing on 1 October 2010.|$|E

25|$|The {{cytoskeleton}} of dendritic spines {{is particularly}} important in their synaptic plasticity; without a dynamic cytoskeleton, spines {{would be unable to}} rapidly change their volumes or shapes in responses to stimuli. These changes in shape <b>might</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> electrical properties of the spine. The cytoskeleton of dendritic spines is primarily made of filamentous actin (F-actin). tubulin Monomers and microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) are present, and organized microtubules are present. Because spines have a cytoskeleton of primarily actin, this allows them to be highly dynamic in shape and size. The actin cytoskeleton directly determines the morphology of the spine, and actin regulators, small GTPases such as Rac, RhoA, and CDC42, rapidly modify this cytoskeleton. Overactive Rac1 results in consistently smaller dendritic spines.|$|E

500|$|In {{the years}} prior to his presidency, Kimball kept a binder of notes and {{clippings}} related to the issue. In {{the first years of}} his presidency, he was recorded as frequently making the issue one of investigation and prayer. In June 1977, Kimball asked at least three general authorities, apostles Bruce R. McConkie, Thomas S. Monson, and Boyd K. Packer, to submit memos [...] "on the doctrinal basis of the prohibition and how a change <b>might</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> Church." [...] McConkie wrote a long treatise concluding there were no scriptural impediments to a change. In 1977, Kimball obtained a personal key to the Salt Lake Temple for entering in the evenings after the temple closed and often spent hours alone in its upper rooms praying for divine guidance on a possible change. On May 30, 1978, Kimball presented his two counselors with a statement that he had written in longhand that removed all racial restrictions on ordination to the priesthood, stating that he [...] "had a good, warm feeling about it." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} {{difficulties}} and unforeseen circumstances delayed construction. [...] First, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission had been conducting archaeological digs {{in the area}} since 1996, and had found a variety of artifacts dating from the Clovis period, with radio carbon age dating around 10,900 BCE, making them {{one of the oldest}} sites in the eastern United States; the sites also includes evidence of food, {{making it one of the}} rarer paleolithic finds. The next circumstance was that there was worry that the construction of the bridge <b>might</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> river ecosystem, particularly some of the river water organisms. After some regulations were added and problems were sorted out, the construction continued. The third issue was that the bridge may run into problems with boaters, and therefore, the bridge was given the same regulations as bridges upstream. Finally, the Delaware's low water level meant that barges could not be used in the construction. When Hurricane Ivan struck in 2004, the water level rose, allowing for the use of the barges, but destroying several construction items used for the bridge in the process.|$|E
500|$|On {{the first}} Finals Week, no contestants were {{eliminated}} due to disrupted telephone and mobile phone services {{in many areas}} of Luzon, caused by Typhoon Xangsane. In the results show, finalists still went through a familiar elimination routine. [...] Agoncillo called three contestants to an area dubbed the [...] "Hot Spot" [...] before revealing that no one would be eliminated and the votes would be carried over to the succeeding week. This was done because there were no official results to be announced. [...] According to sources from the network, the votes were not yet counted at the time. [...] ABC-5 Director for Creative and Entertainment Production Perci Intalan stated that the three finalists who were put in the [...] "Hot Spot" [...] (Marcelo, Armarie Cruz and Jelli Mateo) were not necessarily the Bottom Three. Intalan said, [...] "We were not allowed to announce who the Bottom Three were because the votes will be carried over next week and it <b>might</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> voting if people knew who the Bottom Three were." [...] As a result, two contenders—Stef Lazaro and Drae Ybañez—were eliminated the following week. [...] Another non-elimination occurred on the fourth Finals Week due to reports of disrupted voting (among Sun Cellular and Smart subscribers). The votes amassed for this week were carried over to Week 5. Through the rest of the results night, each of the judges picked one finalist to give an encore performance: Cornejo picked Cruz, Corrales chose Marcelo, and Cayabyab picked Magdangal.|$|E
