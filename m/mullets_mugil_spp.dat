The main finding {{of the study is}} that, although the lake is heavily polluted by crude oil, the water circulation, which is assisted by wind, is such that bioaccumulation of pollutants is avoided. The oil film {{on the surface of the}} lake is forced to outflow into Elefsis Bay and the concentration of heavy metals in the water column and sediment is lower than from other areas without oil pollution. The zoobenthos is rich in large-sized, pollution-resistant Nereis spp. and 64 phytoplankton species exist in the lake.

40|$|The {{regulation}} of freshwater flow into estuaries {{has been identified}} as a potential threat to estuarine ecosystem structure and function, and the productivity of fisheries in particular. Correlative studies are one means by which associations between freshwater inputs and commercial landings have been identified. The study compared monthly landings of five species of finfish and two species of crustacean with monthly and 6 -month running means of river discharge, climatic variables (temperature and rainfall) and the area of vegetated habitat (saltmarsh, mangrove and seagrass) for 11 temperate estuaries on the NSW coast. The monthly climatic and discharge record covered a 10 -year period (1997 – 2007). High river discharge and rainfall were associated with higher catches of flathead (Platycephalus <b>spp.)</b> and <b>Mullet</b> (<b>Mugil</b> <b>spp.),</b> a result consistent with subtropical estuaries to the north. We found no relationships between landings and river discharge for any of the other species, which included school prawns (Metapenaeus macleayi). Temporal variability at a monthly time-step was more consistently associated with variation in temperature, reflecting seasonal variation in activity, and possibly fishing effort. Landings of several species showed strong habitat relationships, with greater seagrass area consistently associated with higher catches of blue swimmer crab (Portunis pelagicus), and intertidal wetlands (mangrove and saltmarsh) with mud crab (Scylla serrata), school prawns, flathead, and <b>mullet</b> (<b>Mugil</b> <b>spp.),</b> a result consistent with habitat-scale surveys. The results draw into question the efficacy of dam releases as stimulants of fisheries productivity in the region, although the effects of flow on juvenile populations and catadromous species were not studied. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Asian {{countries}} contribute nearly 90 {{per cent}} to global production of culture fisheries. Diversification of species {{is not happening}} in fish culture {{because of the high}} value shrimp commands in the export market. Shrimp farming is on the increase in all the major shrimp-producing Asian countries. Higher the growth in shrimp production, higher is the instability in production due to production risks associated with ecosystem complexities and disease incidences. Most of the shrimp-producing countries have been moving towards specialization of shrimp production for export because of the high price that the shrimp asserts in the international market. A comparison between the Asian countries for the period 1976 - 2002 has revealed that Malaysia has maintained low growth and low instability and higher diversification, and Bangladesh and Vietnam have diversified in fish exports. In a country-level comparison, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Philippines have shown moderate growth in production and export of shrimp. The instability associated with their shrimp production has also been moderate. Diversification in fish production as well as exports has been suggested for assured income to farmers and the country. It has been pointed that replacing, supplementing or rotating the shrimp farming with culture of other high-value fish species like Asian sea bass (Lates calcarifer), grouper (Epinephelus spp), <b>mullets</b> (<b>Mugil</b> <b>spp)</b> and milk fish (Chanos spp) culture may ease the risks in mono-cropping of shrimp.

5|$|Adult and {{juvenile}} finetooth sharks form large schools. This energetic, fast-moving predator feeds mainly on small bony fishes, often entering the surf zone {{during the day}} to hunt. The most important prey of this species in the northwestern Atlantic is the Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus), with sharks of all ages off northwestern Florida eat almost nothing else. The menhaden are swallowed whole after the head has been removed. Other known prey species include spot croaker (Leiostomus xanthurus), Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus), <b>mullet</b> (<b>Mugil</b> <b>spp.),</b> shrimp, and in one case a juvenile Atlantic sharpnose shark (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae), {{which may have been}} scavenged from the bycatch discard of a shrimp trawler. The finetooth shark may be preyed upon by larger sharks. Parasites documented from this species include the tapeworm Triloculatum geeceearelensis, and unidentified species in the genera Anthobothrium, Paraorygmatobothrium, and Phoreiobothrium.|$|R

Moderate histological changes (lipid infiltration) were observed in the liver of AIM. Significant changes in plasma variables were observed in AIM. Blood chemistry variables measured proved to be good indicators of artificial feed effects. Classical statistical approaches were applied to the blood chemistry and histopathology data.

Fishes were captured by subsistence fishermen in Vitória Bay, a Brazilian tropical estuary with numerous outfalls of untreated industrial and residential sewage. Based on the premisses that subsistence fisherman and local consumer show weak (culinary or other) preferences within the taxa studied, analyses were conducted and results are reported for genera. Snook cadmium, chromium, copper and zinc concentrations were positively correlated with size or weight. Mullet chromium concentration decreased with size. Cadmium and lead were higher and zinc lower in mullet than in snook. Summer cadmium and lead concentrations were higher than in winter. Chromium presented concentrations consistently over the legal Brazilian limit for seafood. However, the greatest health concern was probably related to lead concentration, especially in respect to consumption by young children...|$|R

Fishing was practiced mostly by adult men, who used 7 fishing arts (gillnetting, hook and line, longline, fish corrals, net of tide canals, casting net, and basket trap), mainly aimed at catching king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla), serra Spanish mackerel (S. brasiliensis), king weakfish (Macrodon ancylodon), weakfish (Cynoscion spp.), hake (Cynoscion spp.), catfish (Bagre bagre), and <b>mullet</b> (<b>Mugil</b> <b>spp.).</b> Fishermen observed in the region 5 turtle species, with a more frequent occurrence of Chelonia mydas (100 %), Dermochelys coriacea (66 %), and Eretmochelys imbricata (46 %); the less frequent species are Caretta caretta (16 %) and Lepidochelys olivacea (8 %). The spawning areas of the 3 most common species demonstrate the significance of the Pará state coast for their conservation.

40|$|Age {{and growth}} were {{determined}} from otoliths for 181 juvenile bluefish, Pomatomus saltatrix, collected {{using a variety}} of gear in northeast Florida during 2003 and 2005. Three distinct cohorts were identified recruiting to the near shore waters during spring, summer and fall. Growth rates were high regardless of cohort or season. To compare pre- and post-recruitment growth rates, models were fit to individual growth trajectories using change point analysis. Post-estuarine growth rates were generally higher. Growth rates and hatching times were within the range of those obtained in other bluefish studies conducted at higher latitudes. As this is the only area where winter recruitment of bluefish has been observed, coastal Florida habitats may be essential for the bluefish stock and will need to be carefully monitored in future studies. A technique to estimate the lipid content of bluefish was developed using fat stage (subjectively assigned based on mesenteric fat around the stomach), fish length, and fish weight. A highly significant relationship was observed between fat stage and lipid content in a generalized linear model. The visual lipid content technique provides rapid results, is inexpensive and could be easily implemented into current fisheries sampling methods. Total lipids were also extracted from potential bluefish prey species collected during sampling. Prey lipids ranged from 0. 88 % to 19. 52 %. Regular prey species from the MAB; Atlantic silverside and bay anchovy contained 3. 49 % and 3. 19 % mean lipids respectively. Highest lipid content was observed in <b>mullet</b> (<b>Mugil</b> <b>spp.)</b> (19. 52 %) and was significantly higher than other available prey species. A previous study indentified a decline in bluefish lipids as winter progressed as well as a prey preference for mullet.
