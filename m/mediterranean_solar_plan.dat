40|$|The EU {{has become}} a world leader in the {{promotion}} of clean energies, adopting the fight against climate change {{as one of its}} identity signs in the international arena. All in all, the development of renewable energies constitutes one of the pillars of the emerging EU’s energy policy, where it has committed to reach a 20 percent of renewable resources of energy in its total consumption for 2020. In this context, there has been an increasing interest in ‘green electricity ’ imports from the southern shore of the Mediterranean in order to reach the up-mentioned objective. Morocco is probably the best positioned country within the Southern Mediterranean region to implement the Solar Plan: it already has a relatively significant solar and wind energy installed capacity and, given its proximity to Spain (14 km), it has the only relevant and functioning electricity interconnection with the EU in the whole region.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{renewable}} energy technology transfer to developing countries can influence the industrialization of their economies and the reduction of their greenhouse gas emissions. There are current plans to deploy large-scale solar and wind capacities in the North Africa countries, including the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>Plan</b> on the public side and the Desertec Industrial Initiative on the private side. We analyse both plans from a technology transfer perspective, drawing a distinction between vertical transfer [...] in which intellectual property and manufacturing capacity remains in industrialized countries [...] and horizontal transfer, in which manufacturing and development skills shift to the developing countries. We find that horizontal technology transfer, when 40 % and more of all components are manufactured locally, would bring significantly higher number of job-years to North Africans than vertical technology transfer, and that {{the greatest number of}} jobs are induced in the service industries. However, the total job creation will still not provide jobs to all unemployed people in the entire region. A case study of Morocco suggests, however, that employment effects could be important for any country that gains a disproportionate share of new investment. Recent policy developments in North Africa show that national governments started to take into consideration possibilities and benefits of horizontal technology transfer by launching plans of industrial development and introducing the rule of local compensation, which foresees a share of components for large-scale projects to be manufactured locally and by North African enterprises...|$|E

40|$|The idea of {{generating}} electricity in North Africa using concentrating {{solar thermal power}} (CSP) {{has been around for}} some time now but has recently gained momentum through the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>Plan</b> (MSP) and the formation of the Desertec Industrial Initiative. This paper argues that while the large-scale deployment of CSP in North Africa does not seem economically attractive for either European or African institutions or countries on their own at present, combining domestic use and electricity exports could be profitable for both parties. A detailed economic portfolio covering both solar and wind power plants can achieve competitive price levels, which would accelerate the diffusion of solar technology in North Africa. This portfolio could be financed partially by exporting electricity from solar thermal plants in North Africa via HVDC interconnections to European consumers. Sharing the costs in this way makes it possible to generate solar electricity for the domesti c market at a reasonable cost. Some of the electricity produced from the solar power plants and wind parks in North Africa is sold on European energy markets {{in the form of a}} long-term contracted solar-wind portfolio, which would qualify for support from the financial incentive schemes of the European Member States (e. g. feed-in tariffs). This transfer of green electricity could help to meet the targets for energy from renewable energy sources (RES) in the EU Member States as the new EU Directive of 2009 opened the European electricity market to imports from third states...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{investigates the}} process of issue {{redefinition}} of Euro-Mediterranean energy relations operated by the European Commission (EC) over time. Section 1 reviews several themes, characterizing {{the literature on the}} European Union (EU) external energy policy, insofar as it is applied to Euro-Mediterranean energy cooperation. It then proposes to use policy formation literature to understand how priorities emerged and/or shifted in EU external energy policy and how they were discursively framed. Section 2 reconstructs the stages in the history of Euro-Mediterranean energy cooperation. The launch of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and the failed endorsement of the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>Plan</b> (MSP) are highlighted as key turning points in the discursive definition of Euro-Mediterranean energy cooperation. Section 3 examines the most recent energy policy debate in light of the insights gained from the previous two sections. Section 4 is a conclusion. The analysis highlights three facts. First, Euro-Mediterranean regional energy cooperation was located within the realm of the EU’s energy policy; since 2004, the EC moved it to the “external relations” framework, to recently embed it into its Foreign and Security Policy. Second, since the enlargement and in particular since Russia–Ukraine gas disruptions, the political salience of import dependency on Russia increased, causing the EC to predicate its policy interest in Euro-Mediterranean energy cooperation on drawbacks in its relations with Russia. Third, the failed endorsement of the MSP brought prospects of regional electricity market integration to a standstill, pushing the EC to fall back on existing policy templates such as the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM), the ENP, and the concept of a “pan-European Energy Community. ...|$|E
40|$|To prevent catastrophic {{results of}} climate change, the {{stabilization}} of atmospheric concentrations of CO 2 below 450 or even 350 {{parts per million}} is necessary. The large-scale electricity generation from renewable energy sources is one of possible options to satisfy the world's growing energy demand and to reduce green house gas emissions from electricity generation. Several studies show technical viability of large-scale deployment of concentrated solar power in North African countries and its further transmission to Europe. Political will exists {{from the side of}} European Union and North African countries to develop renewable energy sources in the Mediterranean region. The <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>Plan,</b> launched by the French presidency, foresees deployment of 20 GW of new solar facilities in the Mediterranean region by 2020. The European Union has a goal to increase the share of renewable energy sources in final energy consumption by 20 % by 2020. Besides, within the EU framework there will be an opportunity for trading renewable energy Guarantees of Origin (GOs), which stimulates import of renewable electricity to Europe. The North African countries introduced ambitious goals of development of renewable energy sources. Based on the Desertec concept, the European industrial enterprises formed a consortium with ambitious goal to develop renewable energy sources in North Africa. The socio-economic development, however, is one of a major concern within the North African countries and international development organizations. In this paper, we present the preliminary results from research conducted {{in the second half of}} the year 2009 and the first half of year 2010, as part of the Addressing North African Questions in the Context of Renewable Energy Development (ANORAQ) project, supported by the European Climate Foundation. The project investigates barriers for deployment of renewable energy sources from the perspective of North African policymakers and concerns. Among other issues like security of supply and technical constraints such as water usage, we focus on socio-economic aspects of large-scale deployment of renewable energy sources. What are the likely employment effects of concentrated solar power development? Will it lead to creation of additional work-places? In which areas direct jobs will be created? Will they be created just in operation and management of plants? What will be the ration of local and international jobs in construction of installations and manufacturing of components? What will be a multiplier effect on creation of indirect jobs? Will the jobs created in new sectors compensate for losses of jobs in other sectors? While our subject will be the North African region as a whole, we will particularly focus on two countries, Egypt and Morocco. There are reasons to assume that influence of large scale deployment of renewables will be different on economies of these two countries as their local economic and resource conditions are different. Egypt is characterized by large non-renewable energies reserves as Morocco covers almost all of its energy needs of imports...|$|E

40|$|In {{their plans}} to move beyond heavy {{dependence}} on fossil fuel imports (Morocco and Tunisia) or to maximise export revenues from domestic oil and gas reserves (Libya, Algeria and Egypt), the North African states stand at a crossroads in terms of energy policy: interest in adopting renewable energy and/or nuclear energy presents opportunities for a strategic realignment of national development paths. Placed in the global sunbelt, rich in wind, geothermal and hydropower resources, the North African countries boast abundant potential for renewable energy production. Although a series of clean energy policy initiatives have recently been introduced in the region, renewable energy resources largely remain untapped. Current efforts to establish large-scale solar power exports to the EU – including the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>Plan</b> and the Desertec industry initiative – anticipate a substantial uptake of renewable energy in North Africa, but so far there has been only limited buy-in by Arab political regimes. At the same time, several North African states are currently seeking to obtain civil nuclear power for several reasons: to meet rapidly growing domestic energy demand, to protect exports revenues from fossil fuels, to demonstrate national technological advancement, and to increase geopolitical recognition {{in the face of}} the growing regional influence of Iran and its nuclear programme. Across North Africa, there is extensive uranium prospecting and exploration being undertaken mainly by Australian, European and Russian companies. This special issue of Energy Policy provides a platform to analyse recent trends in the North African energy systems, as well as their implications for wider energy governance, in the context of this current crossroads for strategic energy investment and development. The geographical focus is on the four North African countries of Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt. Experts from various professional backgrounds address current trends and prospects for renewable and nuclear energy in North Africa, covering optimisation of market and technological options, regional energy infrastructure challenges (e. g. in terms of generation capacity, energy security and integration with European energy and carbon markets) and political-economic governance contexts. There are also in-depth insights on clean energy policy development in Algeria, Egypt and Morocco. Most of the papers in the special issue are revised versions of presentations delivered at an expert workshop – At the Crossroads: Pathways of Renewable and Nuclear Energy in North Africa – held at the London School of Economics and Political Science, UK from October 16 to 17, 2009. The workshop was convened by the LSE Energy, Water and Environment Community initiative and co-hosted with the Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy. Core funding was kindly provided by the Alcoa Foundation Conservation and Sustainability Programme. Following the workshop, several additional papers were commissioned to address themes that the special issue editors regarded as necessary for a balanced, rigorous treatment of renewable and nuclear energy pathways in the region. All published papers have passed the rigorous peer-review process usual for submissions to Energy Policy. In this section, we briefly set out the current financial and political context for the interest of North African states in alternative energy futures, then summarise the key themes of the papers featured in this special issue...|$|E
40|$|DESERTEC aims {{to secure}} the energy needs of the {{countries}} {{north and south of}} the Mediterranean via the large-scale deployment of solar and wind energy plants in MENA (Middle East and North Africa) countries and their systematic inter-connection with European energy markets via high-voltage direct-current lines. This will include in particular the systematic recourse to Concentrating Solar Power (CSP). This not only promises participating countries to reduce their dependency on fossil fuels, and improve their compliance with climate policy provisions, but also to create new sources of income and employment, by speeding up know-how transfer and industrial development processes in them. If implemented on a large scale and with sufficient determination, it could allow participating countries to gain a first-mover advantage in an emerging technology that is likely to {{play a key role in}} the 21 st century and that could lay the bases for an energy system essentially based on green power. In principle, this appears to be a rational choice for the involved countries. CSP could provide firm and controllable electricity at potentially affordable and already declining prices. Moreover, CSP and other renewable energy technologies are not yet as competitive as mature technologies, and therefore offer more opportunities for newcomers; due to the excellent natural conditions in the southern Mediterranean, these countries enjoy substantial comparative advantages vis-à-vis other providers. Finally, looking for alternative energy sources is even more urgent for southern partners than for European countries. Their demand for power is growing rapidly and increasingly exceeding their current capacity of supply. They cannot simply divert fossil fuels for domestic use, as they need the revenues generated through their sale. Making stronger use of renewable energies in general, and of CSP in particular, could offer a solution to this dilemma. The sore point, however, is the cost aspect. In contrast to conventional plants, which are relatively cheap to build, but increasingly expensive to maintain, CSP plants are expensive to build, but cheap to maintain. The high start-up costs are thus the main obstacle for the large-scale deployment of this technology. A closer look at the framework conditions on either side of the Mediterranean shows that the successful implementation of this project is not at all a foregone conclusion, and that much remains to be done before the vision can become reality. The international context of DESERTEC is still characterized by an extraordinary degree of insecurity (regarding future policy preferences, energy prices, capital costs, available technologies and worldwide resources, etc.), and the strong vertical fragmentation of the energy systems of participating countries does not help either. The capital intensity and still evolving nature of CSP technology (plus the elevated energy subsidies and limited spending power of most MENA countries) further aggravate the problem of high up-front costs and potentially slow return ratios of CSP plants. Thus, having a very clear idea of the future requirements of one 2 ̆ 7 s energy system (and of the role which renewable energies should perform in this framework) is key for choosing the right technology for production, transmission, and storage. A key requirement for the large-scale introduction of green power technologies will be the creation of viable local markets for environmentally friendly energy products in southern partner countries. This will need to build on an ‘enabling environment’ that sets the right Steffen Erdle German Development In 2 stitute / Deutsches Institut für Entwicklungspolitik (DIE) incentives for producers and consumers, and offers the necessary safeguards for producers and investors. Only in this case will local markets be able to develop the necessary size for attracting private investment in sufficiently large quantities and for developing local value chains on a sufficiently large scale. Otherwise, it might appear more rational to wait until production costs have come down, even if this would mean loosing an opportunity for ‘catching up’. In any case, it would be a grave mistake to only focus on the creation of landmark projects and forget about the creation of the necessary framework conditions. The large-scale provision of foreign soft loans should not slow down the implementation of the necessary institutional reforms and lead to the reproduction of development-adverse rent structures. It will thus be of utmost importance that policy makers and private promoters cooperate very closely from the very beginning. The fact that DESERTEC has been launched as a private initiative and that the related industrial initiative is pooling key business concerns could provide a crucial added value to the otherwise intergovernmental framework of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation and complement policy-driven formats like the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>Plan</b> (MSP). The MSP itself will offer a policy framework through which DESERTEC could eventually unfold. Its potential contribution is to offer a common ground that allows for a systematic exchange of views between stakeholders from both sides of the Mediterranean about what needs to be done to facilitate the large-scale introduction of environmentally sustainable technologies along the southern rim and to provide for their inter-connection with European markets. This will also need to entail an in-depth revision of the existing legal-institutional frameworks around the Mediterranean. German development organizations could play an important facilitating role in this context. They have accumulated a wealth of experience and expertise in the fields of renewable energies, environmental protection and natural resource management that is both recognized and solicited. In addition, they have also assumed responsibility for the implementation of several large Euro-Mediterranean projects specifically in the renewable energies sphere. They appear thus ideally positioned to provide strategic advice and operational support as to how to organize an enabling legal-institutional environment, create the necessary quality infrastructure, implement large-scale projects, and improve partners’ human resources. The inter-related and well-targeted reform of accounting and pricing systems, plus the choice of the right incentive systems and power purchase agreements, will also be key. The very differentiated nature of German development organizations, and their solid working relationships with southern partner countries, will be important assets from this perspective...|$|E
