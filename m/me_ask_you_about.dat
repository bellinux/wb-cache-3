2500|$|The President began: [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> Lavelle. I was, I {{had it on}} my list this morning. I just don’t {{want him}} to be made a goat. We all know what {{protective}} reaction is. This damn Laird." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see," [...] I {{said after}} a pause, [...] "that momentous things have {{happened}} since my time. I wish you would let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> it all systematically, and would {{explain it to me}} bit by bit. First, {{what do you mean by}} saying that there is no work?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'That's {{the kind}} of a canter,' says I. 'Shake the New York dust off your hoofs and be a real {{agreeable}} kind of a centaur. You broke the ice, you know, and we're getting better acquainted every minute. Seems to <b>me</b> I <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> your family?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am {{delighted to}} hear that our friends have arrived at last,' he said. 'Before I shake hands with them, let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a {{question}} <b>about</b> this queer work of art here. I see photographs of it downstairs. Are they for sale?' ...|$|R
60|$|I dined at Greenwich a {{few days}} ago with Delane. He <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> with much interest. He looks as if he had never seen a printing-office, and had never been out of bed after midnight.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] Robert answered, {{sitting down}} by his sister, and patting her hand affectionately. [...] "It {{was a clear}} case of love at first sight. He {{was in love with}} you before he ever knew your name. He <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> the very first time I saw him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he admitted. [...] "I {{was sent}} for {{into the office}} and found her there with the chief. I felt sure that she {{recognized}} me from the first, and when she agreed to look at Grantham House, she insisted upon it that I should accompany her. While we were in the motor-car, she <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>you.</b> She wished for your address." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only I {{wish you}} had sown those wild oats of yours, George. If you could have seen poor little Miss Emmy's face when she <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> the other day, you would have pitched those billiard-balls to the deuce. Go and comfort her, you rascal. Go and write her a long letter. Do {{something}} to make her happy; a very little will." ...|$|R
5000|$|In one storyline dates Zach Armstrong's (Stephen Phillips) father Paul Armstrong (Geoff Morrell) {{even though}} she is {{attracted}} to Zach. Gay told Clare Rigden from TV Week that Frances spends time with Zach in a dark setting while they drink wine. In the scenes Frances is having [...] "conflicting impulses" [...] in which she thinks [...] "Hey, let's be intimate...but let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> questions <b>about</b> your father." [...] Gay told Yahoo!7's writer that Paul [...] "treats Frances like a lady and I think that's quite a new sensation for her". She finds being taken out [...] "by a man of the world quite beguiling" [...] because she is used to being in control. Frances is [...] "innocent in the face of his worldliness".|$|R
6000|$|Dr. Calibree was a squat, clean-shaven, conscientious-looking man of forty. He was curiously {{like his}} own brown-painted motor car, with eye-glasses for windshield. [...] "Want you to meet my wife, doctor--Carrie, make you 'quainted with Dr. Calibree," [...] said Kennicott. Calibree bowed quietly and shook her hand, but before he had {{finished}} shaking it he was concentrating upon Kennicott with, [...] "Nice to see you, doctor. Say, don't let <b>me</b> forget to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> what <b>you</b> did in that exopthalmic goiter case--that Bohemian woman at Wahkeenyan." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have not}} been useless at all, Mr. Hilliard. The Sirdar <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> and I {{was able to give}} him a very {{favourable}} report of your readiness to be of service, for whatever work I have found for you to do. I have told him that I had great doubts whether Ahmed Bey would have pushed forward to this place, after he had lost the protection of the gunboats, if you had not been with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, {{but some}} suspect it. My father and Murdoch both do. They {{were talking about}} it this morning. They don't know whether to be glad or sorry. Mason paid well {{for the use of}} that inner room, but of late custom has fallen off in other respects. During the last two days we have taken twice as much as we were doing before, so that I think things will be about even. They were <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> and if I knew {{anything}} of your history; but, of course, I could tell them nothing, because I don't know anything myself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{is a nice}} scrape {{into which}} you have got yourself, Godfrey," [...] Ivan Petrovytch said as he entered. [...] "It is lucky for {{you that you are}} not a Russian. But how on earth have you got mixed up in a plot? We know nothing about it beyond the fact that you had been arrested, for, {{although}} a thousand questions were <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> nothing was said to me as to the charge brought against you. We have been in the greatest anxiety <b>about</b> <b>you.</b> All sorts of rumours were current in the city as to the discovery of a plot to assassinate one of the grand-dukes at the Opera-house, and there are rumours that explosive bombs had been discovered in one of the boxes. It is said that the police had received information of the attempt that was to be made, and that every precaution had been taken to arrest the principal conspirator, but that in some extraordinary manner he slipped through their fingers. But surely you can never have been mixed up in that matter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The Bishop of New Zealand, in {{introducing}} {{me to the}} meeting, spoke before all these people of you and {{me in a way}} that almost unnerved me, and I had to speak next. What he said is not reported, or very badly--calling me his dear friend, with his voice quivering--I never saw him more, or so much affected--"I ought to be most thankful to God for giving me so dear a companion, &c." [...] But he spoke so of you, and people here seemed to know of you, coming up to <b>me,</b> and <b>asking</b> <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> after the meeting. The Bishop of Newcastle spoke of you most kindly, and really with very great feeling. An evening I had dreaded ended happily. Before I dined with the three Bishops; last night with Chief Justice Sir Alfred Stephen, and met the trio again, Bishop everywhere speaking of me as one of his family. [...] "No, my boys are not with me; but we have my dear friend Mr. Patteson." [...] Of course all this exhibition of feeling never comes out when we are alone, we know each other too well. And now the romance of Mission work is over, and the real labour is to begin. There has been bad work among the islands lately, but you know in whose hands we are.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Peel thought I {{should ask}} an {{audience}} of the Queen on my [...] retirement, and accordingly at the palace to-day (Feb. 3) he [...] intimated, and then the lord-in-waiting, as is the usage, formally [...] requested it. I saw the Queen in her private sitting-room. As she [...] did not commence speaking immediately after the first bow, I [...] thought it my part to do so; and I said, 'I have had the boldness [...] to request an audience, madam, that I might say with how much pain [...] it is that I find myself separated from your Majesty's service, and [...] how gratefully I feel your Majesty's many acts of kindness.' She [...] replied that she regretted it very much, {{and that it was}} a great [...] loss. I resumed that I had the greatest comfort I could enjoy under [...] the circumstances in the knowledge that my feelings towards her [...] Majesty's person and service, and also towards Sir R. Peel and my [...] late colleagues, were altogether unchanged by my retirement. After [...] a few words more she spoke {{of the state of the}} country and the [...] reduced condition of Chartism, of which I said I believed the main [...] feeder was want of employment. At the pauses I watched her eye for [...] the first sign to retire. But she <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> before we [...] concluded. Then one bow at the spot and another at the door, which [...] was very near, and so it was all over.|$|R
40|$|Before I {{begin to}} tell you some of what I 2 ̆ 7 ve learned as I 2 ̆ 7 ve tried to {{discover}} Mr. [William W. ] Cook, please ponder two questions: What are your feelings about the Law Quad buildings? Think, for example of {{the first time you}} entered the Quad; studying in the Reading Room; seeing the snowy Quad for the first time; and socializing in the Dining Room. You probably have a flood of memories connected to these buildings. The Law School has outgrown them in many respects, but the buildings will always be inspirational. Second, let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> what <b>you</b> know <b>about</b> William W. Cook? How did he acquire the fortune he gave to the Law School? What law did he practice? Where, and when, did he live? I know that, before I undertook my research into Mr. Cook three years ago, I could say that I knew the buildings better than the man who gave us these cloistered, special buildings. In brief, Mr. Cook gave the University of Michigan the Martha Cook Building, then the Lawyers Club, then the John P. Cook dorm (the dorms are named after his parents, Martha and John), then Legal Research, and finally Hutchins Hall. In 1933, the University valued the Law Quad buildings at 5. 3 million. He also gave an endowment valued today at 44 million. Mr. Cook was an extraordinarily generous man. His name isn 2 ̆ 7 t before us every day, as it would be if it were the name of the school. I was very curious to know more about a man who would give so much yet insist his name not be put on a building, let alone an entire school. I wanted to delve even deeper into 2 ̆ 2 who was Mr. Cook 2 ̆ 2 than had earlier writers about the Law School (Professor Alfred Conard, Elizabeth Gaspar Brown, Ilene Forsyth, and Kathryn Horste). I used archival resources as well as libraries, and dug deeply into the digital New York Ttmes and Wall Street Journal. I found more. I want to tell you some of what I have learned about this man to whom we owe so much...|$|R
5000|$|Let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a question...: {{the first}} time you fucked her, was she any good? Yeah? Now let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> another question: how do you think she got that way? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} come here, madam, to ask {{questions}} about your son," [...] I answered. [...] "I have come, if you will excuse <b>me,</b> to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a question <b>about</b> yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> the {{question}} <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> {{a few minutes}} ago," [...] her companion begged. [...] "Were you born in America--or England?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your Highness," [...] {{said the}} Colonel, turning pale; [...] "let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to {{consider}} the importance of your life, not only to your friends, but to the public interest. 'If not to-night,' said this madman; but supposing that to-night some irreparable disaster were to overtake your Highness's person, what, let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> what would be my despair, and what the concern and disaster of a great nation?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What makes <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you?</b> Do {{you deny}} {{my right to}} feel so much {{interest}} in you as to desire to know whether <b>you</b> are <b>about</b> to be married? Of course you can decline to {{tell me if you}} choose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Brave {{and generous}} friend, will <b>you</b> let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> one last question? I am very ignorant, and it {{troubles}} me--just a little." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They're worth {{a bushel}} of diamonds--when you cook 'em. But let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> something--is your old dad as fierce as Uncle Dan?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I don't think it's funny at all,' said Sam. 'But jes let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> one thing: what's {{the name}} of the toll-gate woman?' ...|$|R
5000|$|Mr. Plowman the State: Now, let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a question, ma'am. Do {{you have}} any {{religious}} beliefs or personal beliefs against the death penalty? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{when you}} come down to-morrow night, don't call out! Let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a parting question. What made you cry, 'Halloa! Below there!' to-night?" ...|$|R
60|$|In conclusion, Sir, let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> not {{to force}} on me this {{continued}} correspondence by daily attacks. It is a trouble and a nuisance.|$|R
6000|$|... "I see," [...] he murmured. [...] "And now, having reached {{just this}} stage in our conversation, let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> this. You read the newspapers?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is beyond}} all measure charming of you," [...] Guillot declared, [...] "but let <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a little question. Is it peace or war?" ...|$|R
