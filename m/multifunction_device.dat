Additionally, there is a processor block known as [...] "Media Engine" [...] that contains another 32-bit MIPS32 R4k-base CPU, hardware for multimedia decoding (such as H.264), and a programmable DSP dubbed [...] "Virtual Mobile Engine". The secondary CPU present in the Media Engine is functionally equivalent to the primary CPU save {{for a lack of}} a VPU. The MIPS CPU cores are globally clocked between 1 and 333 MHz. During the 2005 GDC, Sony revealed that it had capped the PSP's CPU clock speed at 222 MHz for licensed software. Its reasons for doing so are unknown, but are the subject of some speculation. Various homebrew tools enable users to operate at 333 MHz, generally leading to a higher frame rate at the expense of battery life. On June 22, 2007, Sony Computer Entertainment confirmed that the firmware version 3.50 does in fact remove this restriction and allows future games to run at the full 333 MHz speed.

This posi-cast and P+ Resonance controllers improve the transient response and eliminate the steady state error in DVR response, respectively. The DVR acts as a virtual impedance with the main aim of protecting the Point of common coupling (PCC) voltage during downstream fault. The proposed algorithm is applied to some disturbances in load voltage caused by induction motors starting, and a three-phase short circuit fault. Also, the capability of the proposed DVR has been tested to limit the downstream fault current.

40|$|As an {{alternative}} to air-conditioning systems, the rooftop turbine ventilator now is not only widely accepted as industrial ventilation, but also has become a common ventilation feature used in other types of buildings including institutional, commercial and residential. Although it is often thought to be very effective even in the lightest wind conditions, but many scientific studies found that its actual performance in the real building is not very promising due to some outdoor climatic constraints and the weaknesses of the device’s configuration itself. Therefore, in order to describe its full characteristics, reliability, limitations and possible improvement of the device, this paper discusses the current development and future prospects of the turbine ventilator by elaborating the results of some experimental and analytical work {{that have been done}} in various aspects of its application and performance.

40|$|Abstract — Electric {{utilities}} and end users of electric power {{are becoming increasingly}} concerned about meeting the growing energy demand. Seventy five percent of total global energy demand is supplied by the burning of fossil fuels. But increasing air pollution, global warming concerns diminishing fossil fuels and their increasing cost have made it necessary to look towards renewable sources as a future energy solution. Since the past decade, {{there has been an}} enormous interest in many countries on renewable energy for power generation. This paper has presented a novel control of an existing grid interfacing inverter to improve the power quality at point of common coupling for a 3 -phase 4 -wire distributed generation system. The inverter is controlled to perform <b>multifunction</b> <b>device</b> by incorporating active power filter functionality. The grid interfacing inverter can be effectively used to compensate the load reactive power, current unbalance and harmonic distortions in addition to active power injection from renewable energy sources. This enables the grid to supply/receive sinusoidal and balanced power at unity power factor. All these functions may be accomplished either individually or simultaneously.

40|$|Many {{clinically}} available, upper-extremity prosthetic limbs provide myoelectric {{control of}} a single device, such as a hand, elbow, or wrist. Most commonly, these systems yield control information from myoelectric signal (MES) amplitude [1] or rate of change of MES [2]. Such systems have been beneficial; however, prosthetic users would no doubt find enhanced functionality and usability if they could reliably control {{more than a single}} function (or device). Seeking to address this issue, extensive work has gone into developing schemes that provide multifunction myoelectric classification with very high accuracy [3]. However, for all continuous multifunction MES classifiers, no matter how accurate and repeatable, there exists no defined threshold (classification accuracy) of acceptability. This is due, in large part, to the limited availability of prosthetic devices housing multiple electromechanical functions. Described in this paper is a recently developed MES control software tool that incorporates state-of-the-art multifunction control and a multifunction, real-time virtual limb. Twelve subjects have performed a virtual clothes pin functional test [4] yielding results that relate classification accuracy and <b>multifunction</b> <b>device</b> usability.

40|$|AbstractUniversity {{students}} {{spend most of}} their time in classrooms that do not always represent an ideal environment for education. This is mainly due to the fact that most university buildings in Slovakia are old.

It is therefore essential to deal with the monitoring of indoor environmental quality in universities in Slovakia and propose realizable measures to improve this situation. The aim of this study is to investigate the particulate matters. The measurements were carried out in the university classroom during lessons.

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} in renewable energy around the world. Since most renewable sources are intermittent in nature, it is a challenging task to integrate renewable energy resources into the power grid infrastructure. In this grid integration, communication systems are crucial technologies, which enable the accommodation of distributed renewable energy generation and play an extremely important role in monitoring, operating, and protecting both renewable energy generators and power systems. This paper presents a novel control strategy for achieving maximum benefits from these grid-interfacing inverters when installed in 3 -phase 4 -wire distribution systems. The inverter is controlled to perform as a <b>multifunction</b> <b>device</b> by incorporating active power filter functionality. The inverter can thus be utilized as: A) power converter to inject power generated from RES to the grid, and B) shunt APF to compensate current unbalance, load current harmonics, load reactive power demand and load neutral current. All of these functions may be accomplished either individually or simultaneously. With such a control, the combination of grid-interfacing inverter and the 3 -phase 4 -wire linear/non-linear unbalanced load at {{point of common coupling}} appears as balanced linear load to the grid. This new control concept is demonstrated with extensive MATLAB/Simulink simulation studies and validated through digital signal processor-based laboratory experimental results.

40|$|Intuitive myoelectric {{prosthesis}} control is difcult to achieve {{due to the}} absence of proprioceptive feedback, which forces the user to monitor grip pressure by visual information.
