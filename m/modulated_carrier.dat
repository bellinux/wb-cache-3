2500|$|... "Superheterodyne" [...] is a {{contraction}} of [...] "supersonic heterodyne", where [...] "supersonic" [...] indicates frequencies above {{the range of}} human hearing. The word heterodyne {{is derived from the}} Greek roots hetero- [...] "different", and -dyne [...] "power". In radio applications the term derives from the [...] "heterodyne detector" [...] pioneered by Canadian inventor Reginald Fessenden in 1905, describing his proposed method of producing an audible signal from the Morse code transmissions of the new continuous wave transmitters. With the older spark gap transmitters then in use, the Morse code signal consisted of short bursts of a heavily <b>modulated</b> <b>carrier</b> wave, which could be clearly heard as a series of short chirps or buzzes in the receiver's headphones. However, the signal from a continuous wave transmitter did not have any such inherent modulation and Morse Code from one of those would only be heard as a series of clicks or thumps. Fessenden's idea was to run two Alexanderson alternators, one producing a carrier frequency 3kHz higher than the other. In the receiver's detector the two carriers would beat together to produce a 3kHz tone thus in the headphones the Morse signals would then be heard as a series of 3kHz beeps. For this he coined the term [...] "heterodyne" [...] meaning [...] "generated by a difference" [...] (in frequency).|$|E

50|$|Bandwidth {{is a key}} {{concept in}} many {{telecommunications}} applications. In radio communications, for example, bandwidth is the frequency range occupied by a <b>modulated</b> <b>carrier</b> signal. An FM radio receiver's tuner spans a limited range of frequencies. A government agency (such as the Federal Communications Commission in the United States) may apportion the regionally available bandwidth to broadcast license holders so that their signals do not mutually interfere.

50|$|By {{representing}} a transmitted symbol {{as a complex}} number and modulating a cosine and sine carrier signal with the real and imaginary parts (respectively), the symbol can be sent with two carriers on the same frequency. They are {{often referred to as}} quadrature carriers. A coherent detector is able to independently demodulate these carriers. This principle of using two independently <b>modulated</b> <b>carriers</b> is the foundation of quadrature modulation. In pure phase modulation, the phase of the modulating symbol is the phase of the carrier itself and this is the best representation of the modulated signal.|$|R
50|$|Power line {{communication}} systems operate by impressing a <b>modulated</b> <b>carrier</b> signal on power wires. Different types of powerline communications use different frequency bands, {{depending on the}} signal transmission characteristics of the power wiring used. Since the power wiring system was originally intended for transmission of AC power, the power wire circuits have only a limited ability to carry higher frequencies. The propagation problem is a limiting factor {{for each type of}} power line communications.|$|E

The main function of OFDM is to convert a frequency selective channel into a collection of frequency- Flat sub channels with partially overlapping spectra. The differentiating factor of this scheme is the orthogonality provided to the subcarriers that provided synchronisation and helps in avoiding ISI. An OFDM signal consists of a number of closely spaced <b>modulated</b> <b>carriers.</b> I...|$|R

5000|$|The {{resulting}} spectra (of {{the three}} cases) are similar, and each contains a dc component—a base sideband containing the modulating signal and phase <b>modulated</b> <b>carriers</b> at each harmonic {{of the frequency}} of the pulse. The amplitudes of the harmonic groups are restricted by a [...] envelope (sinc function) and extend to infinity.The infinite bandwidth is caused by the nonlinear operation of the pulse-width modulator. In consequence, a digital PWM suffers from aliasing distortion that significantly reduce its applicability for modern communications system. By limiting the bandwidth of the PWM kernel, aliasing effects can be avoided.|$|R
5000|$|Overmodulation is the {{condition}} that prevails in telecommunication when the instantaneous level of the modulating signal exceeds the value necessary to produce 100% modulation of the carrier. In the sense of this definition, it is almost always considered a fault condition. In layman's terms, the signal is going [...] "off the scale". Overmodulation results in spurious emissions by the <b>modulated</b> <b>carrier,</b> and distortion of the recovered modulating signal. This means that the envelope of the output waveform is distorted.|$|E
50|$|A {{challenge}} would {{derive from}} multipath effects, which create errors in mapping the delay of a reflection to {{the distance from}} the target. Sometimes the transmitted signal is reflected from walls and any home appliances. A major issue that is currently being fixed is the measuring time of flight is difficult since RF signals travel very fast. The MIT team is currently trying to fix this issue by using a technique named FMCW, which stands for frequency <b>modulated</b> <b>carrier</b> wave.|$|E
50|$|The AGC circuit was problematic. First-generation AGC merely {{detected}} the average {{value of the}} transmitted signal; however, due to the positively <b>modulated</b> <b>carrier,</b> peak power represented peak white - not guaranteed to be present. Thus for a completely black picture, the AGC circuit would increase the RF gain to restore the average carrier amplitude. The result was a screen that was not black but mid-grey. In fact, the total light output of early TV sets was practically constant regardless of the picture content.|$|E

50|$|Like all {{modulation}} schemes, QAM conveys data {{by changing}} {{some aspect of}} a carrier signal, or the carrier wave, (usually a sinusoid) {{in response to a}} data signal. In the case of QAM, the amplitude of two waves of the same frequency, 90° out-of-phase with each other (in quadrature) are changed (modulated or keyed) to represent the data signal. Amplitude <b>modulating</b> two <b>carriers</b> in quadrature can be equivalently viewed as both amplitude modulating and phase <b>modulating</b> a single <b>carrier.</b>|$|R
40|$|Traveling {{wave tube}} {{amplifiers}} (TWTAs), used in satellite transponders, are nonlinear devices. Often, multiple, frequency multiplexed, digitally <b>modulated</b> <b>carriers</b> are transmitted through a satellite transponder. Additionally, square-root raised cosine transmit and received filtering is frequently {{used to reduce}} bandwidth requirements, and a result is a large peak power to average power ratio for each carrier at the TWTA input. In this situation, when the TWTA is operated close to its saturation point, there is large bit error rate performance degradation due to the intermodulation products produced by the nonlinearity. Operation of the TWTA with large input and output backoffs provides more linear operation {{at the expense of}} TWTA output power. A linearizer, which may be implemented as an instantaneous nonlinearity inserted in front of the input to the TWTA, may be designed such that the cascade combination of the linearizer and the TWTA has a considerably more linear characteristic than the TWTA alone. The optimal TWTA operating point, which minimizes the performance losses both due to bit error rate degradation and TWTA output backoff, is obtained with less TWTA output backoff using the linearizer. In this paper, the performances for both the TWTA and the linearized TWTA are obtained by computer simulation, and the performance advantage of the linearized TWTA is determined for extremely bandwidth efficient, frequency multiplexed, square-root raised cosine pulse shaped QPSK <b>modulated</b> <b>carriers.</b> A modest power efficiency advantage of the linearizer is shown for this extremely bandwidth efficient, multicarrier case. 16 page(s...|$|R
