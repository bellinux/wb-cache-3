5|$|Internationally, Hitchcock {{was forced}} to make <b>minor</b> <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> film, mostly to the shower scene. In Britain, the BBFC {{requested}} cuts to stabbing sounds and visible nude shots, and in New Zealand the shot of Norman washing blood from his hands was objected to. In Singapore, though the shower scene was left untouched, the murder of Arbogast, and a shot of Norman's mother's corpse were removed.|$|E

5|$|Level-5 {{worked with}} {{localization}} company Shloc {{to translate the}} game; the two studios collaborated for many weeks. The team found great difficulty when localizing the game for Western regions, particularly due to the large amounts of text and audio that required translation.

All of the destroyers were fitted with ASDIC (sonar) and the ability to use the Two-Speed Destroyer Sweep (TSDS) minesweeping gear.|$|E
5|$|Lady's Realm printed an {{assortment}} of Court and society news alongside articles on more daily tasks such as food, homemaking, and methods for female readers to earn money. It covered the London Season, displaying photographs of significant society figures and débutantes. It claimed to feature over 500 illustrations in each volume. Theatre was another regular topic of the magazine's, as was fiction, poetry, and reports on fashion. The Lady's Realms fashion editor Marian Pritchard regularly wrote articles on emerging fashions in London and Paris, and recommended locations where readers could buy them. While still featuring fashion and beauty, it also encouraged careers for women in music, art, business, and millinery. The magazine maintained this blend of topics relatively consistently, though it gradually made <b>minor</b> <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> proportion it focused on different topics, for instance later focusing less on the nobility {{and more on the}} lives of clergymen and governors general.|$|E

5|$|The FIA {{approved}} <b>minor</b> <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{layout of}} the Marina Bay Street Circuit ahead of the Grand Prix. The modifications ran from turn 11 to turn 13; drivers still turned right at turn 11 but it now kinked left slightly on entry, with the track shifting to the left-hand side of Fullerton Road. This changed the profile of turn 12, as drivers now used {{the other side of}} the Anderson Bridge, while the hairpin at turn 13 has been widened by a metre in order to increase overtaking opportunities. The drag reduction system (DRS) had two activation zones for the race; the first between turns five and seven down the length of Raffles Boulevard, and the second on the start/finish straight between turn 23 to turn one.|$|E
5|$|Windsor Castle {{survived the}} tumultuous {{period of the}} English Civil War, when it {{was used as a}} {{military}} headquarters by Parliamentary forces and a prison for Charles I. At the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, Charles II rebuilt much of Windsor Castle {{with the help of the}} architect Hugh May, creating a set of extravagant Baroque interiors that are still admired. After a period of neglect during the 18thcentury, George III and George IV renovated and rebuilt Charles II's palace at colossal expense, producing the current design of the State Apartments, full of Rococo, Gothic and Baroque furnishings. Queen Victoria made a few <b>minor</b> <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> castle, which became the centre for royal entertainment for much of her reign. Windsor Castle was used as a refuge by the royal family during the Luftwaffe bombing campaigns of the Second World War and survived a fire in 1992. It is a popular tourist attraction, a venue for hosting state visits, and the preferred weekend home of Elizabeth II.|$|E
50|$|In 1991, {{as part of}} a {{restructuring}} of higher education in South Australia, Flinders merged with the adjacent Sturt Campus of the former South Australian College of Advanced Education.

This area, which only had 27 people as of the Canada 2011 Census will be transferred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new riding of Carleton.|$|R
25|$|A <b>minor</b> <b>change</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{appearance}} of the streamlining was {{the removal of the}} locomotives' solid cowcatcher and its replacement with a lattice type, after it was discovered that the original design created a partial vacuum behind the cowcatcher, sucking dust and grime into the slide bars for the centre cylinder, leading to maintenance problems.|$|R
5|$|The E Series 3 was {{announced}} in September 2010. It carried the same motor and drivetrain as before, and only <b>minor</b> <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> exterior. In this series HSV focused on changes to {{the interior of the}} car as well as major upgrades to the computer systems and a new electronic interface called the HSV Enhanced Driver Interface. External changes included the shock wave exhaust tips and grilles and new HID Xenon adaptive projector headlamps. The control panel changes included a new 'Oracle Dash' with upgraded trip computer, tire pressure monitors and fuel statistics; the center console was reworked, introducing the Holden touchscreen IQ system and the HSV EDI performance data logging system (similar to the Nissan GT-R), which displays real-time information on engine speed, brakes, gear shifts, g-forces on the car, steering angle, fuel economy, stability control, Magnetic Ride Control suspension, car dynamics, Bi-Modal Exhaust, battery voltage, oil pressure, power, torque, elevation, exhaust pressure, intake manifold pressure and air intake temp. The system includes preloaded race track locations, stop watches and track maps, satellite navigation, digital radio, Bluetooth, optional DVD player and ability to download data onto a PC using the Motech i2 software. The E Series 3 introduced (SBZA) Side Blind Zone Alert which uses ultrasonic sensors to alert drivers of traffic obstructions in blind spots. Using the HSV EDI the driver can customize operation of the car by for example turning off stability control and controlling the Bi-Modal Exhaust. The E Series 3 offered the option of HSV LPI (Liquid Propane Injection), an LPG Autogas system which allows the use of liquid propane as an alternative fuel. The LPI is controlled by the car's ECU and seamlessly changes from petrol to LPG when the engine has reached optimum temperature (when maximum engine power is required, the system automatically switches back to petrol).|$|E

Although microdochectomy usually preserves <b>the</b> ability <b>to</b> breastfeed, nonetheless <b>the</b> loss of breastfeeding ability is a known complication. Furthermore, infection or hematoma may occur, {{and there may be}} a poor cosmetic result.|$|R
30|$|Changing {{the system}} {{parameter}} or initial conditions alters {{the dynamics of}} the system, therefore, exhibiting chaotic behavior [16]. <b>Minor</b> <b>change</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> non-linear system parameters produces different signals that can be used as an alternate spreading sequence in multiple access spread spectrum communication schemes. Sensitivity to initial conditions and system parameter makes chaotic maps ideal for generating spreading sequences of the appropriate length.|$|R
25|$|Malpighiales is {{monophyletic}} and in molecular phylogenetic studies, {{it receives}} strong statistical support. Since the APG II system {{was published in}} 2003, <b>minor</b> <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> circumscription of the order have been made. The family Peridiscaceae has been expanded from two genera to three, and then to four, and transferred to Saxifragales.|$|E
25|$|Just in {{time for}} Wayne Gretzky's arrival, the Kings' colors changed to black and silver. The new uniforms didn't deviate much from the prior design, save for the color scheme, a new primary Kings logo, and a switch from a {{contrasting}} yoke color to sleeve stripes. With <b>minor</b> <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> text and pant striping, the uniforms were used until the 1997–98 season.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the success}} of the bid, the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) was {{established}} to oversee the ongoing development of the games.

Wollheim made an offer for Jordan's first novel, Warriors of the Ataii, though he withdrew the offer when Jordan {{requested}} some <b>minor</b> <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> contract. Jordan claims that Wollheim's first, 'laudatory' letter convinced {{him that he could}} write, and so he chose to remember the first letter and forget about the second. The novel was never published, but Jordan went on to write the immensely successful Wheel of Time series for a different publisher.|$|E
25|$|While {{scientists}} {{were trying to}} create a new antidepressant to inhibit the NE re-uptake they accidentally synthesised two new compounds, named talopram and talsupram. The two compounds where not marketed in spite of being potent SNRIs {{because of the fact that}} number of suicide attempts were reported in clinical trials. With <b>minor</b> <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chemical structure of talopram (figure 6), including a single 6-cyano (CN) substitution, {{scientists were}} able to convert talopram into a potent SSRI, called citalopram. But citalopram can also be viewed as a constrained analogue of paroxetine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Minor</b> <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> highway were {{approved}} on January 10, 1929, {{in response to}} several objections. The alignment in the Chelsea district was slightly modified to avoid proposed piers, and the path through the markets was realigned to pass over {{a corner of the}} property. In addition, the 14th Street ramps were moved to the area between 19th Street and 23rd Street, where they would spare many markets at 14th Street. In addition, the West Washington Market would no longer be demolished, and instead the highway would graze the roofs of some of the stores.|$|E

50|$|The {{result was}} the IAR 81, a <b>minor</b> <b>change</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> IAR 80A models that were then in production, adding a hinged bomb cradle under <b>the</b> {{centerline}} <b>to</b> throw a 225 kg bomb clear of the propeller (many dive bombers used a similar system). Delivery consisted of a shallow dive from about 3,000 to 1,000 m with the speed around 470 km/h. Pilots disliked the aircraft, as the drag from the bomb cradle seriously hampered performance.|$|R
