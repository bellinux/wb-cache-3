2500|$|The {{relative}} {{certainty of}} the measurements and current state estimate {{is an important}} consideration, and {{it is common to}} [...] discuss the response of the filter in terms of the Kalman filter's gain. The Kalman gain is the relative weight given to the measurements and current state estimate, and can be [...] "tuned" [...] to achieve particular performance. With a high gain, the filter places more weight on the most recent measurements, and thus follows them more responsively. With a low gain, the filter follows the model predictions <b>more</b> <b>closely.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> extremes, a high gain close to one will result in a more jumpy estimated trajectory, while low gain close to zero will smooth out noise but decrease the responsiveness.|$|E
2500|$|By November 1941, many of {{the initial}} assembly-line {{challenges}} had been met, which freed up time for the engineering team to tackle the problem of frozen controls in a dive. Lockheed had a few ideas for tests that would help them find an answer. The first solution tried was the fitting of spring-loaded servo tabs on the elevator trailing edge designed to aid the pilot when control yoke forces rose over , {{as would be expected}} in a high-speed dive. At that point, the tabs would begin to multiply the effort of the pilot's actions. The expert test pilot, 43-year-old Ralph Virden, was given a specific high-altitude test sequence to follow and was told to restrict his speed and fast maneuvering in denser air at low altitudes, since the new mechanism could exert tremendous leverage under those conditions. A note was taped to the instrument panel of the test craft underscoring this instruction. On 4 November 1941, Virden climbed into YP-38 #1 and completed the test sequence successfully, but 15 minutes later was seen in a steep dive followed by a high-G pullout. The tail unit of the aircraft failed at about [...] during the high-speed dive recovery; Virden was killed in the subsequent crash. The Lockheed design office was justifiably upset, but their design engineers could only conclude that servo tabs were not the solution for loss of control in a dive. Lockheed still had to find the problem; the Army Air Forces personnel were sure it was flutter and ordered Lockheed to look <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tail.|$|E

40|$|R&D {{diversification}} {{in large}} U.

Purposively divers ified firms behave differently from randomly diversified or undiversi fied firms. The behavioral differences result because the purposively diversified firms allocate relatively more R&D funds to industry cat egories where appropriation of the returns from R&D is relatively eas y. R&D expenditure and productivity are <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> linked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> gr oup level than <b>at</b> <b>the</b> industry-category level, suggesting spillovers across industry categories are important.

50|$|Common {{species are}} {{frequently}} regarded as being at low risk of extinction {{simply because they}} exist in large numbers, and hence their conservation status is often overlooked. While this is broadly logical, there are several cases of once common species being driven to extinction such as the passenger pigeon and the Rocky Mountain locust, which numbered in the billions and trillions respectively before their demise. Moreover, a small proportional decline in a common species results {{in the loss of}} a large number of individuals, and the contribution to ecosystem function that those individuals represented.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{in this thesis}} is {{to point out the}} mechanisms that govern, and have governed, identity formation in the United States as played out in the novel Middlesex by Jeffrey Eugenides. Looking <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> <b>at</b> how <b>the</b> characters are influenced by the powers and norms that govern their options, their place in society and their possibilities for a fulfilling life of personal freedom, the analysis in this thesis has concentrated on three main areas as these are portrayed in Middlesex: 1.

Immigration, class and the American Dream For a most part, this is a close reading of Middlesex, dwelling on the identity possibilities of the intersex protagonist Cal/lie, and especially his/her quest for self-identification.

Existing visualization methods are based on stream surfaces, direct volume rendering, tensor field visualization, and vector field topology. This paper presents a topological approach which is <b>more</b> <b>closely</b> oriented <b>at</b> <b>the</b> underlying theory of continuous dynamical systems. Algorithms are described {{for the detection of}} vortex rings and vortex breakdown bubbles, and for visualization of their characteristic properties such as the boundary, the chaotic dynamics, and possible islands of stability. Since some of these require very long streamlines, the effect of numerically introduced divergence has to be considered. From an existing subdivision scheme, a novel method for divergence conserving interpolation of cuboid cells is derived, and results are compared with those from standard trilinear interpolation. Also a comparison of results obtained with and without divergence cleaning is given. Categories and Subject Descriptors (according to ACM CCS) : I. 3. 8 [Computer Graphics]: Applications 1...|$|R
