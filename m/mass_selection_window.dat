40|$|The mutant <b>selection</b> <b>window</b> {{hypothesis}} postulates that, {{for each}} antimicrobial-pathogen combination, an antimicrobial concentration range exists in which selective amplification of single-step, drug-resistant mu-tants occurs. This hypothesis suggests an antimutant dosing strategy that is keyed {{to the upper}} boundary of the selection window: the mutant prevention concentration. Correlations are described between the mutant prevention concentration—a static parameter that is measured with agar plates—and fluctuating drug concentrations that restrict mutant amplification in vitro and in animals.

After three generations of random mating, divergent <b>mass</b> <b>selection</b> for ear length was initiated in 1963 {{to determine the effects}} of selection on grain yield. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of 15 cycles of <b>mass</b> <b>selection</b> on ear length, yield, and other agronomic traits and to estimate the genetic variability present in BSLE original population and in subpopulations after 15 cycles of divergent <b>mass</b> <b>selection</b> for ear length;Evaluation of original and advanced cycles of BSLE subpopulations showed significant but asymmetrical response for ear length and most of the other taits. Greater response was exhibited with selection for shorter ears. The asymmetrical response for ear length was probably due to genetic asymmetry and greater environmental sensitivity of long-ear subpopulation compared with the short-ear subpopulation. The effects of genes controlling ear length were also concluded to be small because the asymmetric response was not immediate. Heterosis was detected in the crosses of advanced cycles suggesting significant difference in gene frequencies in the short-ear and long-ear subpopulations with the expression of incomplete dominance for ear length;Genetic variation in the advanced populations, cycle 15 short-ear (BSLE C 15 S) and cycle 15 long-ear (C 15 L), was found to be similar to the original population (BSLE C 0).

This was achieved using seven newly developed microsatellite markers, {{along with three}} published loci. Considering {{the same number of}} samples in each line, the number of different alleles {{in each of the four}} hatchery lines ranged from 49 to 70 alleles from 10 loci, which was approximate 50 % less than the 120 alleles found in the samples from the wild population. However, if we pool all our four hatchery lines together, then their total number of alleles was not significantly different from the wild population. Similar to the patterns found for the DNA microsatellite alleles, mtDNA haplotype numbers were considerably lower in each of the hatchery lines than in the samples from the wild population. Again, pooling the hatchery lines gave a total haplotype number not statistically significantly different from that in the samples from the wild. Considering together the DNA microsatellite alleles and the mtDNA haplotypes, we conclude that there was a substantial loss of genetic diversity within all lines separately over generations of <b>mass</b> <b>selection,</b> and that such <b>mass</b> <b>selection</b> was not sustainable in the long term. However, importantly, these data indicate that for oysters, if multiple independent <b>mass</b> <b>selection</b> lines are kept, then their combined genetic diversity may approach that of the ancestral line or wild population even after many generations of <b>mass</b> <b>selection.</b> These results for oysters, finding preservation of diversity among lines yet loss within them, are similar to recent findings for multiple banana shrimp lines; considering both species together it suggests that one relatively simple option suitable for some farms and industry to maintain genetic diversity during <b>mass</b> <b>selection</b> over many generations of selection is to subdivide their breeding nucleus and keep multiple different and independent lines over generations.

In addition, we analyzed the molecular bases for resistance in the bacterial subpopulations selected at different points in the window. At the top of the window, the resistant clones isolated were mainly mutated in GyrA and ParC topoisomerase subunits, while {{at the bottom of the}} window, resistance was associated with the overexpression of MexCD-OprJ and MexAB-OprM efflux pumps. Accordingly, a greater proportion of multidrug-resistant clones were found among the subpopulations isolated at the lower CIP concentrations.

For many traits, half-sib and S(, 1) derived populations had similar estimates of genetic variance.
