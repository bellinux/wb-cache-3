40|$|The recent move to in situ {{conservation}} management world-wide {{is supported}} by, and stems from the 1992 International Convention on Biological Diversity. The Department of Conservation - charged with the conservation of New Zealand's natural resources - has directed efforts towards the restoration of natural processes as an avenue to halt local biodiversity decline. Ecosystem, habitat, and nature restoration programmes such as the Boundary Stream Mainland Island Project (BSMIP) represent the forefront of conservation management, combining intensive multi-species pest control, with broad-scale hierarchical <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes.</b> <b>Monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> confer information that is intended to support decision-making and management by the reduction of uncertainty, or by increasing knowledge. The validity of <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> depends on three key parts; the guiding objectives, biological relevance, and statistical reliability. Seven major long-term <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> established at the BSMIP were evaluated {{according to the above}} criteria. All <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> had appropriate guiding objectives, and were biologically relevant (outcome and result monitoring were balanced respective {{to each other and to}} the restoration intervention and efforts at BSMIP). The statistical reliability of the programmes was appraised with the use of the Computer <b>programme</b> <b>MONITOR,</b> which provided a calculated value for the statistical power of the <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes.</b> All <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> except two (Lizard monitoring: which was initially designed as a short-term species survey, and Mustelid monitoring: which would be a good candidate for a double sampling methodology) had a robust design (evaluated using the actual initial data, and conservative criteria for the detection of population change). The <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> that did achieve a level of statistical robustness, provided a statistical power of 0. 8 (80 %) within appropriate timeframes for restoration of ecosystem processes (e. g. the timeframe for detection of a 10 % change in the abundance, density, relative index, etc of the Result monitoring programmes: Rodents = three years, Possums = six years, and Outcome monitoring programmes: Weta = five years, Ground Invertebrates = four years, Birds (species nos.) = four years, Vegetation (Species, and sapling nos.) = 15 years). The guiding objectives for <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> must have clear, specific, measurable, and achievable goals, in-order to identify appropriate variables, in both spatial and temporal scales. The biological relevance or "linkage" between monitored groups is important and must be at least outlined, for <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> to be able to identify potential cause and effect. Statistical reliability (the balance between statistical significance, statistical power, and the timeframe for a conclusive result to be determined) is important, as it is the key method of detecting change. Statistical power can improve the design and efficiency of <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> and clarify research results. Power analysis has become readily available for researchers and managers with the development of computer programmes specifically designed for this task...|$|R

40|$|Adaptation is {{increasingly}} recognised as essential {{when dealing with}} the adverse impacts of climate change on societies, economies and the environment. However, there is insufficient information {{about the effectiveness of}} adaption policies, measures and actions. For this reason, the establishment of <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> is considered to be necessary. Such programmes can contribute to knowledge, learning and data to support adaptation governance. In the European Union (EU), member states are encouraged to develop National Adaptation Strategies (NASs). The NASs developed so far vary widely because of differing views, approaches and policies. A number of member states have progressed to monitoring and evaluating the implementation of their NAS. It is possible to identify key elements in these <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> that can inform the wider policy learning process. In this paper, four generic building blocks for creating a <b>monitoring</b> and evaluation <b>programme</b> are proposed: (1) definition of the system of interest, (2) selection of a set of indicators, (3) identification of the organisations responsible for monitoring and (4) definition of monitoring and evaluation procedures. The <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> for NAS in three member states—Finland, the UK and Germany—were analysed to show how these elements have been used in practice, taking into account their specific contexts. It is asserted that the provision of a common framework incorporating these elements will help other member states and organisations within them in setting up and improving their adaptation <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) poses {{many new}} {{challenges}} to European water managers. <b>Monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> {{play a key}} role to assess the status and identify possible trends in the environmental conditions of river basins; to gain new knowledge on water processes and to assess to which extent implemented measures actually have the expected effects in terms of improving the environmental status. Despite a general acknowledgement in the scientific community on the benefits of using monitoring and modelling jointly, it has not been the common practise in the European <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> so far. Several obstacles may be identified which limits the joint use of monitoring and modelling, such as lack of the required skill, lack of time, lack of confidence in models but also a lack of awareness on how models can be used in practise. In this paper we provide examples on how modelling can support the <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> to meet the objectives of the <b>monitoring</b> <b>programmes</b> in the WFD more efficiently. The extent to which the monitoring requirements in the WFD can be expected to supply sufficient data for modelling purposes is further addressed. This question is, however, not well posed, as the data requirement for modelling is highly dependent on the required accuracy of the model results. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2007...|$|R

There is a large number of performance criteria, but there are no baseline data and no methodology for monitoring.

25|$|In 2011, the United Nations' Joint <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Programme</b> for Water Supply and Sanitation {{estimated}} that only 55% of the Yemeni population {{had access to}} improved water source – including 40% from house connections and 15% from other improved water sources such as standpipes. Only 53% had access to improved sanitation. Access to improved water supply, using a broad definition of access, {{is estimated to be}} much higher in urban areas than in rural areas (72% vs. 47%). The urban-rural gap is much higher for improved sanitation (93% vs. 33%). Due to rapid population growth, access to water supply actually declined in relative terms from 66% in 1990 to 55% in 2011 despite a substantial increase in absolute access. However, access to improved sanitation increased from 24% to 53% during the same period, according to the estimates.|$|E
25|$|Sanitation. National Household Budget Surveys ask {{respondents}} {{about the}} type of sanitary facility they have. In 2007 93% of Tanzanians responded that they had some form of latrine, but only 3% had a flush toilet. International statistics that monitor {{the achievement of the}} Millennium Development Goal for sanitation are based on these numbers, but only after making some important adjustments in an effort to achieve comparability across countries. The Joint <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Programme</b> for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) defines improved sanitation as excreta disposal systems that are private and that separate human excreta from human contact. Shared latrines or open pit latrines are excluded from this definition. The JMP estimates that only about half the latrines in Tanzania can be considered improved sanitation systems. Based on that definition, access to improved sanitation is much lower than the population with access to any type of latrine. According to the JMP definition, access to improved sanitation was only 10% in 2010, up from 8% in 1990, with an increase in urban areas and a slight decrease in rural areas.|$|E
