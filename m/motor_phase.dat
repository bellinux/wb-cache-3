50|$|The direct torque method {{performs}} {{very well}} even without speed sensors. However, the flux estimation is usually {{based on the}} integration of the <b>motor</b> <b>phase</b> voltages. Due to the inevitable errors in the voltage measurement and stator resistance estimate the integrals tend to become erroneous at low speed. Thus {{it is not possible to}} control the motor if the output frequency of the variable frequency drive is zero. However, by careful design of the control system it is possible to have the minimum frequency in the range 0.5 Hz to 1 Hz that is enough to make possible to start an induction motor with full torque from a standstill situation. A reversal of the rotation direction is possible too if the speed is passing through the zero range rapidly enough to prevent excessive flux estimate deviation.|$|E
40|$|In {{switched}} {{reluctance motor}} drives, the combination of power-electronic converter and a <b>motor</b> <b>phase</b> defines a resonant circuit, comprised by the <b>motor</b> <b>phase</b> inductance and the parasitic capacitance of converter switches, power cables and <b>motor</b> <b>phase</b> winding. If a <b>motor</b> <b>phase</b> is excited by applying very short voltage pulses, the resonance frequency of the circuit can be observed through the subsequent damped oscillation of the induced voltage in the phase. As the phase inductance and associated resonance frequency depend on the rotor position, the method provides a means for estimating the rotor position. This paper discusses {{the influence of the}} magnetic inductive coupling between motor phases on the observed damped voltage resonance. It is shown that the motor-converter combination can be modelled as a system comprising different resonant circuits, each associated with one phase of the machine, which are mutually coupled due to the inductive coupling between the motor phases. An eigenvalue analysis reveals the different eigenfrequencies and modes of oscillation for this system. It follows from the analysis that damped voltage resonances occur in all phases of the machine due to the mutual coupling. The model is used to determine the influence of voltage pulses, applied to a single phase or simultaneously applied to different phases, on the observed damped voltage oscillations, and thus on the rotor position estimation...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{optimized}} five-level inverter topology is proposed for a four pole induction motor drive. This topology has developed {{by using the}} advantage of two identical voltage profile winding coils per phase in a four pole induction motor. The identical voltage profile winding coils are disconnected and {{each part of the}} winding is fed with two two-level inverters from both sides. Thereby four two-level inverters are used to generate five voltage levels on induction <b>motor</b> <b>phase</b> windings. All two-level inverters are fed with single DC link with the magnitude V dc over 4 (where V dc is the dc-bus voltage required for a conventional NPC five-level inverter). Because of the common DC link for all the two-level inverters, common mode currents will find a path through the <b>motor</b> <b>phase</b> windings {{due to the lack of}} isolated neutral. To minimize the common mode currents a Sine-Triangle Pulse Width Modulation is used in the proposed topology. Thereby the first dominant harmonics and triplen harmonics shifted near to the switching frequency, which will have a less impact on the <b>motor</b> <b>phase</b> currents. Since the dominant harmonics are less in the proposed topology, it gives almost sinusoidal output voltage which will improve the efficiency of the drive system.

For salient machines in general, the associated resonance frequency of the circuit depends on the rotor position.

An overview is given of different possibilities to trigger the voltage resonance. It is shown that the proposed position estimation method has favourable characteristics such as measurement of large-amplitude voltages, robustness against temperature deviations of motor and power semiconductors, very high update rates for the estimated position and absence of sound and disturbance torque.
