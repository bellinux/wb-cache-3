5|$|A surface weather {{analysis}} {{is a type}} of weather <b>map</b> <b>that</b> depicts positions for high and low-pressure areas, as well as various types of synoptic scale systems such as frontal zones. Isotherms can be drawn on these maps, which are lines of equal temperature. Isotherms are drawn normally as solid lines at a preferred temperature interval. They show temperature gradients, which can be useful in finding fronts, which are on the warm side of large temperature gradients. By plotting the freezing line, isotherms can be useful in determination of precipitation type. Mesoscale boundaries such as tropical cyclones, outflow boundaries and squall lines also are analyzed on surface weather analyses.|$|E
5|$|As a point-and-click {{adventure}} game, {{the player}} controls Simon using the mouse. The iOS and Android versions feature touch-screen controls. Gameplay involves moving Simon around and interacting with objects and other characters. The player can make Simon perform actions such as giving an item to another character, talk to another character, {{and pick up}} (add to inventory), examine, use, move, consume, wear, or open or close an item. Some actions are binary: they involve two objects and the player sometimes, after telling Simon to use an item, needs to specify what to use it with. A <b>map</b> <b>that</b> enables Simon to instantly transport to a major landmark (if it has been discovered) is provided. The postcard is used to load, save, or quit the game.|$|E

This successful run prompted IFC Films to show this version in nine additional markets on 16 January. Che will be shown in its entirety, commercial and trailer free with an intermission and limited edition program book at every screening. Soderbergh {{has said that the}} film's roadshow version will not be released on DVD but released in two parts with the animated <b>map</b> <b>that</b> opens the roadshow's second half missing from Part II, as well as the overture and intermission music.|$|E

5|$|Chicago-area Latino groups contested the {{legislative}} district {{map of the}} Illinois General Assembly in United States federal court. The panel of judges that decided the case ordered a new <b>map</b> <b>that</b> gave Hispanics a majority in two Illinois House of Representatives districts in Chicago, the 9th, which is predominantly Puerto Rican, and the 20th, which is predominantly Mexican American. In 1982, Nedza sponsored Berrios, at the time chief clerk to Cook County Board of (Tax) Appeals Commissioner Harry Semrow, in the 9th district. Berrios {{was one of three}} candidates who filed nominating petitions to run in the Democratic primary, but Berrios ran unopposed when the petitions of the other two candidates were successfully challenged. Republicans fielded no candidate in their primary, so Berrios ran unopposed in the general election, and at the age of 30 became the first Hispanic American to serve in the Illinois General Assembly. Berrios ran for re-election unopposed in the Fall 1986 general election. He won re-election twice, serving three two-year terms.|$|E

Between the games, the two have broken off their relationship and Elaine has moved to her governor's mansion on Booty Island. When Guybrush appears at the mansion, she presumes he has come to apologize; instead he is looking for a <b>map</b> <b>that</b> belonged to Elaine's grandfather, which leads to fabled treasure Big Whoop. After discovering Guybrush's intentions, Elaine is infuriated and refuses to speak to him. Guybrush eventually becomes trapped at the site of Big Whoop, with Elaine arriving to rescue him. Guybrush falls into a chasm, where he is confronted by LeChuck, recently resurrected as a zombie. As the game ends with Guybrush thinking he is a child in a theme park, Elaine is seen worrying that LeChuck has placed a curse on Guybrush.|$|E

A poster displaying a map of similar design has been hanging in DC Councilman Jack Evans' office for a number of years, but received scant attention until 2008. Wyman, one of the original designers of the map, was confirmed as the layout specialist who would be redesigning the map by the Washington Post on June 4, 2011.|$|E

5|$|In April 1989, Voight {{returned}} to Colombia to the volcano Galeras after being {{contacted by the}} United Nations Disaster Relief Organization. People in Pasto, located {{at the foot of}} the volcano, had become alarmed by noises and shaking from Galeras. While Galeras proved far easier to climb than Nevado del Ruiz, land mines planted to hinder guerrilla forces dotted the slopes of the mountain. With USGS geologist Dick Janda, Voight drew a hazard <b>map</b> <b>that</b> included several populated areas within the danger zone. Before Voight left Galeras, the volcano underwent an unexpected phreatic eruption, which Voight and his team failed to predict. Although Pasto was unaffected, six scientists attending a United Nations workshop for natural disaster relief were killed. After reviewing deformation data from the day before the eruption, Voight discovered that no acceleration in the deformation process had occurred. He surmised that phreatic eruptions do not exhibit an acceleration in deformation before taking place and left after confirming that the volcano's monitoring system functioned properly.|$|E

As with the preceding Total War game, Shogun: Total War, the game consists of two broad areas of gameplay: a turn-based campaign <b>map</b> <b>that</b> allows the user to move armies across provinces, control agents, diplomacy, religion, and other tasks needed to run their faction, and a real-time battlefield, where the player directs the land battles and sieges that occur.|$|E
5|$|Several {{volcanic}} {{features in}} the Mount Cayley field were illustrated by volcanologist Jack Souther in 1980, including Mount Cayley, Cauldron Dome, Slag Hill, Mount Fee, Ember Ridge and Ring Mountain, which was titled Crucible Dome at the time. This resulted {{in the creation of}} a geologic <b>map</b> <b>that</b> showed the regional terrain and locations of the volcanoes. The most detailed study of Mount Cayley took place during this period. Little Ring Mountain at the northernmost end of the field had not been studied at the time and was not included on Souther's 1980 map. Ember Ridge at the southern end of the field was originally mapped as a cluster of five lava domes. The sixth lava dome, Ember Ridge Northeast, was discovered by Ph.D. student Melanie Kelman during a period of research in 2001.|$|E
