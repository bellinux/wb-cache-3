In this work, the effects of EL coating parameters, SiC particle size and morphology on the coating uniformity and <b>mechanical</b> <b>bonding</b> at the SiC/Ni–P interface were studied.

50|$|A lath or slat is a thin, {{narrow strip}} of straight-grained wood used under roof {{shingles}} or tiles, on lath and plaster walls and ceilings to hold plaster, and in lattice and trellis work.

Also reed mat was historically a lath material. One of the key elements of lath, whether wooden slats or wire mesh, are the openings or gaps that allow plaster or stucco to ooze behind and form a <b>mechanical</b> <b>bond</b> to the lath where gypsum lath relies more on a chemical bond.|$|E
40|$|Click on the DOI link {{to access}} the article (may not be free). Dielectric {{elastomers}} are soft actuation materials with promising applications in robotics and biomedical devices. In this paper, a bio-inspired artificial muscle actuator with artificial tendons is developed for robotic arm applications. The actuator uses dielectric elastomer as artificial muscle and functionalized carbon fibers as artificial tendons. A VHB 4910 tape is used as the dielectric elastomer and PDMS is used as the bonding material to mechanically connect the carbon fibers to the elastomer. Carbon fibers are highly popular for their high electrical conductivities, mechanical strengths, and bio-compatibilities. After the acid treatments for the functionalization of carbon fibers (500 nm - 10 pm), one end of carbon fibers is spread into the PDMS material, which provides enough bonding strength with other dielectric elastomers, while the other end is connected to a DC power supply. To characterize the actuation capability of the dielectric elastomer and electrical conductivity of carbon fibers, a diaphragm actuator is fabricated, where the carbon fibers {{are connected to the}} actuator. To test the <b>mechanical</b> <b>bonding</b> between PDMS and carbon fibers, specimens of PDMS bonded with carbon fibers are fabricated. Experiments have been conducted to verify the actuation capability of the dielectric elastomer and <b>mechanical</b> <b>bonding</b> of PDMS with carbon fibers. The energy efficiency of the dielectric elastomer increases as the load increases, which can reach above 50 %. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>bonding</b> is strong enough for robotic arm applications...|$|R

5000|$|The {{strength}} of non-covalent interactions in a mechanically interlocked molecular architecture increases {{as compared to}} the non-mechanically bonded analogues. This increased strength is demonstrated by the necessity of harsher conditions to remove a metal template ion from catenanes as opposed to their non-mechanically bonded analogues. This effect {{is referred to as the}} [...] "catenand effect". This increase in {{strength of}} non-covalent interactions is attributed to the loss of degrees of freedom upon the formation of a <b>mechanical</b> <b>bond.</b> The increase in strength of non-covalent interactions is more pronounced on smaller interlocked systems, where more degrees of freedom are lost, as compared to larger mechanically interlocked systems where the change in degrees of freedom is lower. Therefore if the ring in a rotaxane is made smaller the strength of non-covalent interactions increases, the same effect is observed if the thread is made smaller as well.|$|E
5000|$|A {{soldering}} gun is an approximately pistol-shaped, electrically powered tool for soldering metals using tin-based solder {{to achieve a}} strong <b>mechanical</b> <b>bond</b> with good electrical contact.

The body of the tool contains a transformer with a primary winding connected to mains electricity when the trigger is pressed, and a single-turn secondary winding of thick copper with very low resistance. A soldering tip, made of a loop of thinner copper wire, is secured {{to the end of the}} transformer secondary by screws, completing the secondary circuit. When the primary of the transformer is energized, several hundred amperes of current flow through the secondary and very rapidly heat the copper tip. Since the tip has a much higher resistance than the rest of the tubular copper winding, the tip gets very hot while the remainder of the secondary warms much less. A tap on the primary winding is often used to light a pilot lamp which also lights the workpiece.|$|E

40|$|Key {{challenges}} {{associated with}} the EGS reservoir development include the ability to reliably predict hydraulic fracturing and the deformation of natural fractures as well as estimating permeability evolution of the fracture network with time. We have developed a physics-based rock deformation and fracture propagation simulator by coupling a discrete element model (DEM) for fracturing with a network flow model. In DEM model, solid rock is represented by a network of discrete elements (often referred as particles) connected by various types of <b>mechanical</b> <b>bonds</b> such as springs, elastic beams or bonds that have more complex properties (such as stress-dependent elastic constants). Fracturing is represented explicitly as broken bonds (microcracks), which form and coalesce into macroscopic fractures when external and internal load is applied. The natural fractures are represented {{by a series of}} connected line segments. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>bonds</b> that intersect with such line segments are removed from the DEM model. A network flow model using conjugate lattice to the DEM network is developed and coupled with the DEM. The fluid pressure gradient exerts forces on individual elements of the DEM network, which therefore deforms the <b>mechanical</b> <b>bonds</b> and breaks them if the deformation reaches a prescribed threshold value. Such deformation/fracturing in turn changes the permeability of the flow network, which again changes the evolution of fluid pressure, intimately coupling the two processes. The intimate coupling between fracturing/deformation of fracture networks and fluid flow makes the meso-scale DEM- network flow simulations necessary in order to accurately evaluate the permeability evolution, as these methods have substantial advantages over conventional continuum mechanical models of elastic rock deformation. The challenges that must be overcome to simulate EGS reservoir stimulation, preliminary results, progress to date and near future research directions and opportunities will be discussed. Methodology for coupling the DEM model with continuum flow and heat transport models will also be discussed...|$|R
