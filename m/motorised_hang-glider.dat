25|$|In 1997, Manser and {{his friend}} Jacques Christinet tried to enter Peninsular Malaysia from Singapore to fly a <b>motorised</b> <b>hang-glider</b> during the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur. However, he was {{recognised}} at the border and denied entry into Malaysia. They then decided to swim across the Straits of Johor into Malaysia but later abandoned the plan, because it involved a lengthy 25-kilometer swim and a passage through a swamp across the straits. They planned an alternate route, opting to row a boat from an island in Indonesia into Sarawak, but Bruno Manser Foundation (BMF) in Switzerland received a warning from Malaysian embassy, warning of the consequences for such an act.|$|E
