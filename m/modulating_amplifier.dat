40|$|The next {{generation}} of integrated transceiver front-ends needs both robust low noise amplifiers and high power amplifiers on a single-chip. The Aluminium Gallium Nitride / Gallium Nitride (AlGaN/GaN) High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMT) is a suitable semiconductor technology for this purpose due to its high breakdown voltage and high electron mobility. In this thesis the AlGaN/GaN HEMTâ€™s thermal properties, noise and survivability have been characterized for the intended use in robust high power transceivers. Furthermore, a new characterization setup for load modulated high efficiency power amplifiers have been developed. The thermal properties of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs have been carefully investigated considering self-heating {{and its effect on}} small-signal parameters and high frequency noise. Self-heating is a severe problem for a high power transistor on any semiconductor material, including GaN. In addition to reliability problems, the performance of the operating HEMT degrades with temperature. The access resistances showed a large temperature dependence, which was also verified with TLM measurements. Due to the large self-heating, the temperature dependence of the access resistances has {{to be taken into account}} in the modeling of the AlGaN/GaN HEMT. A temperature dependent small-signal noise model was derived and verified through fabricated amplifiers. Design strategies for robust low noise amplifiers are discussed and implemented using the derived model.

However, switching modulators used in such architectures to generate the envelope signal are difficult to implement because of the high bandwidth and low switching ripple requirement, while achieving high efficiency even at large power back-off. This paper presents a wideband supply modulator for a 20 MHz RF bandwidth polar modulated PA. Realized in 65 nm CMOS, it consists of a cascoded nested Miller compensated linear amplifier and a class D switching amplifier. The class-AB linear amplifier with cascoded Miller compensation in the modulator reduces the output switching ripple to 4. 3 mVrms at a switching frequency of 118 MHz. With an optimized design the modulator achieves a maximum efficiency of 87. 5 % and a small signal $-$ 3 dB bandwidth of 285 MHz. At 10 dB back-off the efficiency is more than 40 %.

40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{describes the}} design, development, {{and implementation of}} a linear high efficiency power amplifier. The symmetrical Doherty power amplifier utilizes TriQuint 2 Ì† 7 s 2 nd Generation Gallium Nitride (GaN) on Silicon Carbide (SiC) High Electron Mobility Transistor (HEMT) devices (T 1 G 6001032 -SM) for a specified design frequency of 3. 6 GHz and saturated output power of 40 dBm. Advanced Design Systems (ADS) simulation software, in conjunction with Modelithic 2 Ì† 7 s active and passive device models, were used during the design process and will be evaluated against the final measured results. The use of these device models demonstrate a successful first-pass design, putting less dependence on classical load pull analysis, thereby decreasing the design-cycle time. The Doherty power amplifier is a load <b>modulated</b> <b>amplifier</b> containing two individual amplifiers and a combiner network which provides an impedance inversion on the path between the two amplifiers. The carrier amplifier is biased for Class-AB operation and works as a conventional linear amplifier. The second amplifier is biased for Class-C operation, and acts as the peaking amplifier that turns on after a certain instantaneous power has been reached. When this power transition is met the carrier amplifier 2 Ì† 7 s drain voltage is already approaching saturation. If the input power is further increased, the peaking <b>amplifier</b> <b>modulates</b> the load seen by the carrier amplifier, such that the output power can increase while maintaining a constant drain voltage on the carrier amplifier. The Doherty power amplifier can improve the efficiency of a power amplifier when the input power is backed-off, making this architecture particularly attractive for high peak-to-average ratio (PAR) environments. The design presented in this manuscript is tuned to achieve maximum linearity at the compromise of the 6 dB back-off efficiency {{in order to maintain}} a carrier-to- intermodulation ratio greater than 30 dB under a two-tone intermodulation distortion test with 5 MHz tone spacing. Other key figures of merit (FOM) used to evaluate the performance of this design include the power added efficiency (PAE), transducer power gain, scattering parameters, and stability. The final design is tested with a 20 MHz LTE waveform without digital pre-distortion (DPD) to evaluate its linearity reported by its adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR).

40|$|Dead-time {{effect is}} one of the {{dominant}} sources of output current and voltage distortion for pulse width <b>modulated</b> (PWM) <b>amplifiers.</b> Practical switching devices have finite turnon and turn-off time. To avoid short circuit a blanking time is added between turn-off and turn-on of the complementary working switches in a switching-leg. The blanking time, also referred to as dead-time, results in a nonlinear voltage error of the PWM output stage. Especially high-precision applications that require accurate input current for positioning systems suffer from the dead-time effect. Extensive studies have been done on the analysis and elimination, minimization and compensation of dead-time in PWM converters. Most of these techniques rely on the detection of the polarity of the output current of the converter. By using only the polarity of the output current, the inductor current ripple is neglected, which is not sufficient for high-precision applications. In this paper nonlinear feedforward of the current setpoint is used to compensate the dead-time effect. This simple feedforward technique leads to significant improvement of the current tracking during zero crossings over a high output current frequency range, as demonstrated by measurement results...|$|R

40|$|Mathematical {{analysis}} of Doherty amplifiers have assumed many simplifications. Most notably, the peaking amplifier does not contribute power into the load and the peaking stage has an observed impedance of infinity. This paper {{will show that}} these simplifications impair {{the performance of a}} single-input Doherty amplifier and that phase tuning for compensation is needed to improve the overall system performance. The dual-input Doherty amplifier is capable of overcoming the limitations of power-dependent phase imbalance and phase compensation lines at the input of the peaking stage; however, the characterization of such an architecture is not straightforward. A new measurement technique is proposed to measure dc current, dc voltage, and output power levels to allow unique characterization of a dual-input Doherty amplifier.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Electrical and Computer EngineeringWilliam B. KuhnThe {{design of}} power {{amplifiers}} in any semi-conductor {{process is not}} a trivial exercise and it is often encountered that the simulated solution is significantly different than the results obtained. Oscillatory phenomena occurring either in-band or out of band and sometimes at subharmonic intervals can render a design useless. Other less apparent effects such as jumps, hysteresis and continuous spectrum, {{often referred to as}} chaos, can also invalidate a design. All of these problems might have been identified through a more rigorous approach to stability analysis. Designing for stability is probably the one area of amplifier design that receives the least amount of attention but incurs the most catastrophic of effects if it is not performed properly. Other parameters such as gain, power output, frequency response and even matching may have suitable mitigation paths. But the lack of stability in an amplifier has no mitigating path. In addition to the loss of the design there are the increased production cycle costs, costs involved with investigating and resolving the problem and the costs involved with schedule slips or delays resulting from it. The Linville or Rollett stability criteria that many microwave engineers follow and rely exclusively on is not sufficient by itself to ensure a stable and robust design. It will be shown that the belief that unconditional stability is obtained through an analysis of the scattering matrix S to determine if K> 1 and [delta][supscript]s< 1 can fail and other tools must be used to validate circuit stability. With the emphasis being placed on stability, a 1 W pulse <b>modulated</b> S-band power <b>amplifier</b> is designed using a battery of analysis tools in addition to the standard Linville or Rollett criteria to rigorously confirm the stability of the circuit.
