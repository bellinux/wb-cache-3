50|$|<b>Madagascar</b> <b>rosewood</b> (Dalbergia maritima), {{known as}} bois de rose, is highly prized for its red color. It is overexploited in the wild, despite a 2010 {{moratorium}} {{on trade and}} illegal logging, which continue on a large scale.|$|E
5000|$|Among {{them is the}} use of a high, arched {{and carved}} back for the guitar, which is {{considerably}} thicker and heavier than a conventional guitar. The back is made of <b>Madagascar</b> <b>rosewood,</b> while the top is always made of Western Redcedar. The lightweight of the top combined with Smallman's unique system of bracing makes the guitar very responsive to input with a full rounded sound (not thin). The top of Smallman guitars is braced using a [...] "lattice" [...] framework composed of balsa wood and carbon fibre. By contrast, traditional classical guitars use struts made of cedar or spruce arranged in a [...] "fan" [...] shape.|$|E
500|$|Marojejy also {{contains}} {{several types of}} rare rosewood and palisandre (genus Dalbergia), {{all of which are}} endemic to <b>Madagascar.</b> [...] <b>Rosewood,</b> or andramena in Malagasy, is a type of hardwood with a lustrous deep red color, while palisandre, such as Dalbergia madagascariensis, lacks the red color. [...] Of the three species of Dalbergia found in Marojejy, D.madagascariensis and D.baronii are listed as [...] "vulnerable" [...] on the IUCN Red List, while D.louvelii is listed as [...] "endangered." [...] The park has few large specimens of the former two due to overexploitation, and specimens are rarely found in the surrounding [...] surrounding the park. [...] The latter, D.louvelii, is not found outside of the park.|$|R
2500|$|Rosewood (of {{the family}} Leguminosae) {{generally}} has a deep, lustrous red coloration, whereas ebony (of the family Ebenaceae) has a dark, heavy fine wood grain. Malagasy rosewoods include Dalbergia baronii, D. louvelii, and the [...] "palissandre wood" [...] D. madagascariensis (which lacks the distinctive red coloration). These rare, endemic species are mainly {{found in the}} SAVA Region and the Makira-Masoala Landscape of <b>Madagascar.</b> Although <b>rosewood</b> species from other countries have traditionally been used for high-class musical instruments and furniture, these sources have been depleted, leaving Madagascar {{as one of the}} leading sources. Ebony, on the other hand, belongs to the large mostly tropical genus Diospyros. The rare, endemic ebony species of Madagascar grow primarily in the northwestern part of Madagascar, but some also grow in Marojejy and Masoala national parks. Both species are slow growing, and take as much as 300 years or more to reach maturity.|$|R
