5|$|Ashland, {{originally}} called Ashland Mills, {{was named}} after Ashland County, Ohio, the original home of founder Abel Helman, and secondarily for Ashland, Kentucky, where other founders had family connections.

5|$|Although {{industry}} was rapidly expanding throughout {{the northern part}} of the state, Indiana remained largely rural at the turn of the 20th century with a growing population of 2.5million. Like <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the American Midwest, Indiana's exports and job providers remained largely agricultural until after World War I. Indiana's developing industry, backed by inexpensive natural gas from the large Trenton Gas Field, an educated population, low taxes, easy access to transportation, and business-friendly government, led Indiana to grow into one of the leading manufacturing states by the mid-1920s.|$|E

5|$|Conte di Cavour was {{the name}} ship of the three s built for the Royal Italian Navy (Regia Marina) in the 1910s.

5|$|Tension between {{traditional}} Khitan {{social and political}} practices and Chinese influence and customs was {{a defining feature of}} the dynasty. This tension led to a series of succession crises; Liao emperors favored the Chinese concept of primogeniture, while <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the Khitan elite supported the traditional method of succession by the strongest candidate. So different were Khitan and Chinese practices that Abaoji set up two parallel governments. The Northern Administration governed Khitan areas following traditional Khitan practices, while the Southern Administration governed areas with large non-Khitan populations, adopting traditional Chinese governmental practices.|$|E

5|$|After {{five hours}} of fighting, the troops subdued the Comanche resistance. Buffalo Hump escaped, but 70 Comanches were killed or mortally wounded, only two of them noncombatants.

5|$|After {{the film}} was {{released}} on April 6, 2007, ticket sales performed significantly below box office analysts' expectations despite mostly positive critic reviews. In <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the world, each feature was released separately in extended versions. Two soundtracks were also released for the features and include music and audio snippets from the film. The feature later found more success on DVD and Blu-ray. In several interviews, despite the box office failure, the directors have expressed their interest in a possible sequel to the film due to its critical acclaim and successful home media sales. Three spin-off films were later made, based on Grindhouses fake trailers: Machete, Machete Kills and Hobo with a Shotgun.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, streams flowed from {{highlands}} in central Arizona north and across what is today the western Grand Canyon, possibly feeding a larger river.

Possible explanations include headward erosion or a broken natural dam of a lake or river. Whatever the cause, the Lower Colorado probably captured the landlocked Upper Colorado somewhere west of the Kaibab Uplift. The much larger drainage area and yet steeper stream gradient helped to further accelerate downcutting.|$|E

He became heir apparent to the English, Irish, and Scottish thrones {{on the death of}} his elder brother, Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, in 1612. An unsuccessful and unpopular attempt to marry him to the Spanish Habsburg princess Maria Anna culminated in an eight-month visit to Spain in 1623 that demonstrated the futility of the marriage negotiations. Two years later, he married the Bourbon princess Henrietta Maria of France instead.|$|E
5|$|His {{life and}} with it his reign, which were longer than any other British monarch before him, were marked {{by a series of}} {{military}} conflicts involving his kingdoms, <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> Europe, and places farther afield in Africa, the Americas and Asia. Early in his reign, Great Britain defeated France in the Seven Years' War, becoming the dominant European power in North America and India. However, many of Britain's American colonies were soon lost in the American War of Independence. Further wars against revolutionary and Napoleonic France from 1793 concluded in the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.|$|E

5|$|In ancient Egypt, cats were sacred animals, {{with the}} goddess Bastet often {{depicted}} in cat form, sometimes {{taking on the}} war-like aspect of a lioness. The Romans are often credited with introducing the domestic cat from Egypt to Europe; in Roman Aquitaine, a first- or second-century engraving {{of a young girl}} holding a cat is one of two earliest depictions of the Roman domesticated cat. However, cats possibly were already kept in Europe prior to the Roman Empire, as they may have been present in Britain in the late Iron Age. Domestic cats were spread throughout <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the world during the Age of Discovery, as ship's cats were carried on sailing ships to control shipboard rodents and as good-luck charms.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that Charles Darwin might {{have suffered from}} Chagas disease {{as a result of}} a bite of the so-called great black bug of the Pampas (vinchuca) (see Charles Darwin's illness). The episode was reported by Darwin in his diaries of the Voyage of the Beagle as occurring in March 1835 to the east of the Andes near Mendoza. Darwin was young and generally in good health, though six months previously he had been ill for a month near Valparaiso, but in 1837, almost a year after he returned to England, he began to suffer intermittently from a strange group of symptoms, becoming incapacitated for <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> his life.

Six weeks into the shoot, cinematographer Alun Bollinger had a serious car accident. His replacement, John Blick, later alternated duties with Bollinger for <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the shoot.
