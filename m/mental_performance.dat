40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine whether athletes differ from nonathletes {{regarding}} their <b>mental</b> rotation <b>performance.</b> Furthermore, it investigated whether athletes doing sports requiring distinguishable levels of mental rotation (orienteering, gymnastics, running), as well as varying with respect to having an egocentric (gymnastics) or an allocentric perspective (orienteering), differ from each other. Therefore, the Mental Rotations Test (MRT) was carried out with 20 orienteers, 20 gymnasts, 20 runners, and 20 nonathletes. The results indicate large differences in <b>mental</b> rotation <b>performance,</b> with those actively doing sports outperforming the nonathletes. Analyses for the specific groups showed that orienteers and gymnasts differed from the nonathletes, whereas endurance runners did not. Contrary to expectations, the <b>mental</b> rotation <b>performance</b> of gymnasts did not differ from that of orienteers. This study also revealed gender differences in favor of men. Implications regarding a differentiated view of the connection between specific sports and <b>mental</b> rotation <b>performance</b> are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Research {{on mental}} {{rotation}} has consistently found sex differences, with males outperforming females on mental rotation tasks like the Vandenberg and Kuse (1978) mental rotation test (MRT; D. Voyer, Voyer, 2 ̆ 6 Bryden, 1995). Mental rotation ability {{has been found}} to be enhanced with experience (Nazareth, Herrera 2 ̆ 6 Pruden, 2013) and training (Wright, Thompson, Ganis, Newcombe, 2 ̆ 6 Kosslyn, 2008) and the effects of training have been found to be transferable to other spatial tasks (Wright et al., 2008) and sustainable for months (Terlecki, Newcombe, 2 ̆ 6 Little, 2008). Although, we now are fairly certain about the malleability of spatial tasks and the role of spatial activity experience, we seem to have undervalued an important piece of the puzzle. What is the mechanism by which experiential factors enhance <b>mental</b> rotation <b>performance?</b> In other words, what is it that develops in an individual as a consequence of experience? The current dissertation sought to address this gap in the literature by examining cognitive strategy selection as a possible mechanism by which experiential factors like early spatial activity experience enhance <b>mental</b> rotation <b>performance.</b> A total of 387 adult university students were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions. The three experimental conditions differed in the amount and type of non-spatial information present in the task stimuli. Participant eye movement was recorded using a Tobii X 60 eye tracker. Study I investigated the different types of cognitive strategies selected during mental rotation, where eye movement patterns were used as indicators of the underlying cognitive strategies. A latent profile analysis revealed two distinct eye movement patterns significantly predicting <b>mental</b> rotation <b>performance.</b> Study II examined the role of early spatial activity experience in <b>mental</b> rotation <b>performance.</b> Male sex-typed spatial activities were found to significantly mediate the relation between participant sex and <b>mental</b> rotation <b>performance.</b> Finally, Study III examined the developmental role of early spatial activity experience in cognitive strategy selection and strategy flexibility to enhance <b>mental</b> rotation <b>performance.</b> Strategy flexibility was found to be significantly associated with <b>mental</b> rotation <b>performance.</b> Male sex-typed spatial activity experiences were found to be significantly associated with cognitive strategy selection but not strategy flexibility. Implications for spatial training and educational pedagogy in the STEM fields are discussed. ...|$|R

25|$|Undernutrition during pregnancy, {{and other}} factors, may cause intrauterine growth {{retardation}} (IUGR), {{which is one}} cause of low birth weight. However, {{it has been suggested}} that in IUGR the brain may be selectively spared. Brain growth is usually less affected than whole body weight or length. Several studies from developed nations have found that with the exception of extreme intrauterine growth retardation also affecting brain growth, and hypoxic injury, IUGR seems to have little or no measurable effect on <b>mental</b> <b>performance</b> and behavior in adolescence or adulthood. For example, acute undernutrition for a few months during the Dutch famine of 1944 caused a decrease in mean birthweight in certain areas. This was later associated with a change in performance on IQ tests for 18–19 years old Dutch males draftees from these areas compared to control areas. The subjects were exposed to famine prenatally but not after birth. During the famine, births decreased more among those with lower socioeconomic status (SES), whereas after the famine, there was a compensatory increase in births among those with lower SES. Since SES correlates with IQ, this may have hidden an effect caused by the undernutrition.|$|E

The Daniel Fast resembles the vegan diet in that it excludes foods of animal origin.

40|$|The {{present study}} used an {{intensive}} longitudinal design {{to examine whether}} <b>mental</b> rotation <b>performance</b> varies according to a monthly cycle in {{both males and females}} and whether these variations are related to variations in progesterone, estradiol, and testosterone levels. We collected reaction time and accuracy data for 10 males and seven females each workday over eight weeks using 136 pairs of mental rotation stimuli/ day, and measured sexual hormones concentrations in the saliva twice a week. A mixed linear model statistical analysis revealed that all females and seven males showed significant cycle effects in <b>mental</b> rotation <b>performance.</b> The female cycle showed an amplitude that was twice as large compared with the amplitude found in males. For males and females, estradiol and testosterone were significantly linearly and quadratically related to interindividual variation in performance {{at the beginning of the}} study (progesterone was linearly related to performance for females). The association between testosterone and performance differed across sexes: for males, it had an inverse U-shape, for females it was U-shaped. Towards the end of the study, none of the hormones were significantly related to performance anymore. Thus, the relationship between hormones and <b>mental</b> rotation <b>performance</b> disappeared with repeated testing. Only estradiol levels were significantly elevated at the lowest point of the cycle in <b>mental</b> rotation <b>performance</b> in females. In conclusion, in this intensive longitudinal study spanning two months, a monthly cycle in <b>mental</b> rotation <b>performance</b> was found among both males and females, with a larger cycle 2 ̆ 7 s amplitude for females...|$|R

2500|$|The British {{psychologist}} Charles Spearman in 1904 {{made the}} first formal factor analysis of correlations between the tests. He observed that children's school grades across seemingly unrelated school subjects were positively correlated, and reasoned that these correlations reflected the influence of an underlying general mental ability that entered into performance {{on all kinds of}} mental tests. He suggested that all <b>mental</b> <b>performance</b> could be conceptualized in terms of a single general ability factor and a large number of narrow task-specific ability factors. Spearman named it g for [...] "general factor" [...] and labeled the specific factors or abilities for specific tasks s. In any collection of test items that make up an IQ test, the score that best measures g is the composite score that has the highest correlations with all the item scores.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the effects of fear as a basic emotion on <b>mental</b> {{rotation}} <b>performance.</b> We expected that the emotional arousal evoked by fearful stimuli presented prior to each mental rotation trial would enhance <b>mental</b> rotation <b>performance.</b> Regarding the influence of anxiety, high anxious participants are supposed to show slower responses and higher error rates in this specific visuo-spatial ability. Furthermore, with respect to the embodied cognition viewpoint we wanted to investigate if the influence of fear on <b>mental</b> rotation <b>performance</b> is the same for egocentric and object-based transformations. Results show that fear enhances <b>mental</b> rotation <b>performance,</b> expressed by a higher mental rotation speed. Interestingly, this influence is stimulus-specific: it is restricted to egocentric transformations. Both observation of emotional stimuli and egocentric strategies are associated with left hemisphere activation which could explain a stronger influence on this type of transformation during observation. Another possible notion is the conceptual link between visuo-spatial perspective taking and empathy based on the co-activation of parietal areas. Stronger responses in egocentric transformations could result from this specific link. Regarding the influence of anxiety, participants with high scores on the trait-anxiety scale showed poor results in both reaction time and mental rotation speed. Findings of impoverished recruitment of prefrontal attentional control in patients with high scores in trait anxiety could be the explanation for this reduced performance...|$|R

Aim The paper reviews existing methodologies, which {{may be used to}} substantiate and validate such claims of desirable effects of foods on <b>mental</b> state and <b>performance.</b> Results Mood, arousal, activation, vigilance, attention, sleep, motivation, effort, perception, memory and intelligence have been identified as relevant aspects of <b>mental</b> state and <b>performance.</b> The basic scientific concepts within this field as well as the methodologies to measure these concepts have been reviewed and described. Conclusions From this review it is concluded that, in principle, the phenomena in these fields are no different to those in other fields of life science. The scientific methods and protocols described in this report can positively demonstrate the effects of foods on <b>mental</b> state and <b>performance</b> in a scientifically valid way. A claim on <b>mental</b> state and <b>performance</b> like other claims must be based on scientific evidence.

SETTING AND SUBJECTS: Random sample of 2757 general practitioners. INTERVENTION: In 2001, a nationwide programme was initiated to improve primary mental health care. The programme used a participatory approach with regional needs assessment and regional selection of the interventions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Perceived need, availability and participation in the interventions; self-reported <b>mental</b> health <b>performance</b> (self-reported diagnosis and management of mental health disorders); perceived barriers to optimal care. RESULTS: Baseline and follow-up questionnaires were returned by 1336 and 1358 general practitioners, respectively. Interventions did not entirely match general practitioners' needs. <b>Mental</b> health <b>performance</b> did not change consistently while perceived barriers to optimal care decreased considerably. Actual participation in the interventions was not associated with improved <b>mental</b> health <b>performance</b> or decreased perception of barriers. CONCLUSIONS: The application of the nationwide programme had no considerable impact on the professional practices of general practitioners with regard to mental health care.
