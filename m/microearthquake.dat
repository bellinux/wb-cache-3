The aim of the present study is to investigate the relationship between electrical resistivity structure and the hypocentral distribution of <b>microearthquakes</b> in the area. The calculated impedance tensor at each site has been obtained from the observed data and decomposed to remove galvanic distortion, provided that the regional strike is N 32 ?E to obtain the 2 -D apparent resistivity and phase responses.

The fact that the conductive zone correlates with the hypocentral zone is probably attributed to fluids in the crust.

40|$|International audienceThe Séchilienne rockslide, in the French Alps, has {{recently}} been instrumented with three seismic arrays. This network has recorded numerous rockfalls and local <b>microearthquakes.</b> Because the media is highly fractured, {{it is difficult to}} identify and pick first arrivals. Beam-forming methods were therefore used to locate these events. The method has been adapted {{to take into account the}} heterogeneity of seismic wave velocities. The location accuracy has been estimated to be about 50 m for epicenters by applying the method to calibration shots. Depth is less constrained due to uncertainties on the velocity model and due to the seismic network geometry. This method of location has then been applied to rockfalls and <b>microearthquakes.</b> Most rockfalls initiate in the most active part of the rockslide called Les Ruines; the others are located on a recent eroded area aside from Les Ruines. The network also allows the estimation of the rockfall trajectory and propagation speed. Finally, 55 <b>microearthquakes</b> have been located within two zones. <b>Microearthquakes</b> are located within the first 250 m below the surface. Most <b>microearthquakes</b> are located in Les Ruines, the most active part of the rockslide, where the velocity has increased from 0. 5 m/yr in 1996 to 1. 4 m/yr in 2008.

These spectral ratios were inverted for seismic moments and corner frequencies using the multiple empirical Green's function approach. Both static stress drops and apparent stresses of <b>microearthquakes</b> at Parkfield do not largely differ from those reported for moderate and large earthquakes. It is likely that the dynamics of <b>microearthquakes</b> at Parkfield {{is similar to that of}} natural tectonic earthquakes in a macroscopic viewpoint.

40|$|Seismic signals {{recorded}} by <b>microearthquake</b> observation networks {{are available for}} a hypocentral determination of local events {{as well as for}} an evaluation of the azimuth and apparent velocity of the teleseismic P waves. The coherent nature of teleseismic P waves recorded at each of the stations of a <b>microearthquake</b> observation network satisfies a basic requirement for the application of an array processing. In the case of the Wakayama <b>Microearthquake</b> Obseravatory with a network spanning 120 - 150 km, the coherency function is as large as 0. 8 - 0. 9 in the frequency range of less than 2. 5 Hz in which the power spectrum amplitude has a maximum peak. The cross-correlation function is used for the arrival time measurement of P waves relative to each of two specified stations. The damped least squares method is introduced to evaluate the azimuth and apparent velocity of incoming teleseismic P waves. The standard error in the azimuth is less than ± 1 ° and that of the apparent velocity is less than 0. 016 relative to its value, when the arrival time difference of the P waves between the two stations can be measured with the error of less than 0. 1 sec. Despite of the coherent nature of teleseismic P waves {{recorded by}} a <b>microearthquake</b> observation network, a nonsystematic distribution of stations in geometry produces unfavourable effects on the resolution of the data processing. In the case of ordinary array stations, the main lobe of the beam pattern is predominant in its amplitude and is clearly separated from side lobes through the delay and sum procedures. In the case of <b>microearthquake</b> observation networks, however, the simple delay and sum procedure fails to make an evident separation of the main lobe in the beam pattern.

It turned out that 60 per cent of the 193 events were classified as <b>microearthquakes,</b> exhibiting distinct P and S waves, while 17 per cent of these events remained unclassified. Out of the <b>microearthquakes,</b> 40 events with a good signal-to-noise ratio were selected and processed.  P- and S-wave traveltimes were picked on the records and the inferred hypocentral distances agree with the two zones of the scarp exhibiting fresh ruptures after the fall. Polarization analysis of the 3 -C records, along with numerical simulations, allowed discriminating between the two possible rupture mechanisms (toppling and sliding). Shear rupture (sliding) was the predominant mode in the lower part of the column whereas traction rupture (toppling) affected the upper part. Finally, the comparison between the ground motions recorded on the column and on the rock mass showed a systematic amplification on the column.

This paper discusses the space-time features of the precursory seismicity. We provide {{a brief description of}} this explosive and effusive eruption between December 2010 and March 2013. The eruption started with some explosive activity followed by extrusion of a viscous lava flow. The extrusion of viscous andesitic magma and the motion of the lava flow down the slope were accompanied by unusual seismicity {{in the form of the}} quasiperiodic occurrence of <b>microearthquakes,</b> the so-called drumbeat phenomenon. It is shown that the occurrence of a drumbeat was first recorded during the extrusion process at the volcano's summit. Subsequently, the drumbeat mode of activity was caused by the front of the viscous lava flow as it was moving down the slope. The dynamic parameters of the <b>microearthquakes</b> varied in accordance with the dimensions of the lava flow front. The motion of the main tongue of the lava flow (March to September 2011) gave rise to drumbeat I with energy classes of <b>microearthquakes</b> K = 3 - 5. 5, while the second tongue, which was smaller than the first, produced drumbeat II with <b>microearthquakes</b> of K < 3 during its motion down the slope.

A moving-window analysis of the entire seismograms, including the coda, gives g(t), the difference in arrival times versus running time along the seismogram. The time resolution of the method is {{an order of magnitude}} better than the digitization interval. The g(t) technique is illustrated with a pair of <b>microearthquakes,</b> M = 1. 7 and 2. 0, that occurred before and after the Coyote Lake...|$|R
