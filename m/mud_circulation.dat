30|$|The {{influence}} of temperature {{changes on the}} physical properties of granite has been widely reported (Somerton 1992) and includes, for example, a decrease in elastic moduli (Heard and Page 1982; Griffiths et al. 2017), an increase in rock sample porosity (David et al. 1999), a reduction in strength (Nasseri et al. 2007; Chaki et al. 2008; Violay et al. 2017; Xu et al. 2017; Griffiths et al.  2017) and changes (generally an increase) in permeability (Géraud 1994; David et al. 1999; Darot and Reuschlé 2000; Chaki et al.  2008; Meredith et al. 2012). The {{influence of}} temperature variations on these mechanical parameters is more complex to understand when the rock sample is cyclically heated and cooled. This situation is, however, relevant for thermally dynamic environments such as geothermal reservoirs (e.g., sequences of <b>mud</b> <b>circulations</b> in wells during drilling, thermal stimulation of the wells, variations in well flow during exploitation, etc.). Indeed, {{the impact on the}} mechanical properties and characteristics of the rock may vary from one cycle to another. For instance, Thirumalai and Demou (1974) measured the thermal dilatation of two granites (Halecrest and Charcoal Granite) during cyclical heating and cooling. They observed a permanent dilatation of the granites following the first cycle, but the dilatation during the third cycle was reversible. During the first heating/cooling cycle, their observations show that microcracking occurred in the sample. The following cycles had a much-reduced impact on microcracking.|$|R

Lost {{circulation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} troublesome problems encountered in drilling due to uncontrolled flow of drilling mud into the formation that likely to happen due to ineffective filter cake. The smaller particles of drilling mud are able to break through into the larger void spaces in the formation which lead to lost circulation.

40|$|Drilling {{operations}} are preformed by several countries. Some countries {{are forced to}} drill offshore, whereas others to drill onshore. Offshore drilling {{operations are}} more challenging comparing to onshore operations. The sea waves disturbs the rig/drill ship continuously. Floaters such as drill ships and floating rigs are more affected by the waves than fixed construction. The result of the sea waves are horizontal and vertical movements of the floaters. However, the horizontal movements are eliminated with advanced positioning systems. Whilst the vertical movements are avoided with use of heave-compensators. Extension of the drill string is needed during drilling operations. The extension stage is called &# 147;connections&# 148;. During connections, the mud pump and the heave-compensators are disabled. Which causes the floaters to oscillate vertically due to the sea waves. Such vertical movements of the floaters causes the drill string to move vertically inside the well. Vertical movements of the drill string are unwanted, as they create pressure changes in the wellbore. Pressure alterations may cause huge damages to the well and the drill string. However, several control techniques have been developed {{in order to obtain}} constant pressure throughout a connection. Common for this techniques are the consideration of a deactivated mud pump and no <b>mud</b> <b>circulations,</b> as in reality. It is therefore interesting to activate the mud pump and investigate the effect of continuous circulation during connections. Furthermore, the possibility to control the circulation to attain constant pressure.

40|$|Well VC- 2 B is a {{continuous}} core hole drilled in the Sulphur Springs {{area of the}} Valles caldera, New Mexico. It reached a temperature of 295 " C at a total depth of 5780 feet. Borehole televiewer logs are available for the depth interval of 704 feet to 910 feet where measured temperatures are about 140 " to 145 " C. This interval is the principal zone of lost circula-tion in the well and contains numerous fractures that can be identified as faults, mode I extensional frac-tures, hydrothermal breccias and completely and par-tially sealed fractures.

30|$|There are {{two general}} {{approaches}} {{to prevent or}} minimize lost circulation problems. The first approach is called the preventive approach. This method can be used when the drill engineer anticipates that a lost circulation event may occur in a specific zone, but has not yet occurred. In this approach, lost circulation can be prevented by adding materials to the mud that will seal fractures and strengthen the wellbore, therefore, preventing a fracture from further propagation or worsening the fluid loss. The second approach is called corrective lost circulation treatment and {{can be achieved by}} adding materials known as lost circulation materials. When mixed with the <b>mud,</b> lost <b>circulation</b> materials have the ability to plug the fracture and seal it if their particle size is big enough to do so. The type, shape, composition, size distribution and strength of the lost circulation materials (LCMs) can also be important to design an efficient solution treatment to address lost circulation (White 1956). In this paper, we propose a smart expandable material made out of shape memory polymers that can seal the fracture and strengthen the wellbore.|$|R

They represent great heterogeneities in all facets from the geological structure to the flow responses so that characterization and modeling of these reservoirs have been a real challenge for petroleum engineers.

They may act as barriers, hindering the production and thus causing different scenarios for economical production. Although the fracture system can increase the porosity and hence the initial oil in place, this causes the drilling fluid lost <b>circulation.</b> <b>Mud</b> invasion through the fracture system gives rise to the cost and time of drilling operation; therefore modeling of fracture system is crucial for assessing the connectivity of the reservoir. In general, familiarity of the fracture system model is important for the development of oil fields, economical issues of geothermal reservoirs and production from groundwater sources.

30|$|Having a good {{estimation}} of geothermal gradient and the reservoir temperature {{has a great}} impact on the methodological reservoir management; however, as temperature is measured by wire line tools, its determination encounters the same difficulties as reservoir pressure measurement. In addition to the effect of reservoir temperature on rheology of <b>circulation</b> <b>mud</b> during drilling and on the quality analysis of petrophysics logs, it has a direct effect on determination of dew point pressure in gas reservoirs. Based on the dew point pressure, the amount of condensate in the reservoir and on the surface is forecasted. The amount of deposited condensate in the reservoir has a great influence on the relative permeability of reservoir rock and consequently will impact on the reservoir performance, especially on the potential of wells production in their life period. On the other hand, economy of development of a gas reservoir is totally dependent on the amount of produced condensate on the surface. Therefore, the reservoir temperature not only has technically a great influence on the field management method but also has a crucial effect on the final decision about the development of the reservoir.|$|R

30|$|A multi-objective {{optimization}} of {{oil well}} drilling {{has been carried}} out using a binary coded elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. A Louisiana offshore field with abnormal formation pressure is considered for optimization. Several multi-objective optimization problems involving two-and three-objective functions were formulated and solved to fix optimal drilling variables. The important objectives are: (i) maximizing drilling depth, (ii) minimizing drilling time and (iii) minimizing drilling cost with fractional drill bit tooth wear as a constraint. Important time dependent decision variables are: (i) equivalent <b>circulation</b> <b>mud</b> density, (ii) drill bit rotation, (iii) weight on bit and (iv) Reynolds number function of circulating mud through drill bit nozzles. A set of non-dominated optimal Pareto frontier is obtained for the two-objective optimization problem whereas a non-dominated optimal Pareto surface is obtained for the three-objective optimization problem. Depending on the trade-offs involved, decision makers may select any point from the optimal Pareto frontier or optimal Pareto surface and hence corresponding values of the decision variables that may be selected for optimal drilling operation. For minimizing drilling time and drilling cost, the optimum values of the decision variables are needed to be kept at the higher values whereas the optimum values of decision variables are at the lower values for the maximization of drilling depth.|$|R
40|$|Increased {{demand for}} oil and gas pushes {{producers}} to develop and enhance methods for exploring deeper reservoirs located in offshore fields. With greater depths comes greater complications, this greater water depth along with other unknown formation factors in conjunction with the high daily rental cost of offshore rigs, equipment and personnel renders performing research and development on a deep water offshore well prohibitively expensive. However, with the occurrence of incidents such as the Macondo in 2010, regulators and operators have been prompted to be more cautious and perform research in offshore drilling operations, to better understand the unknown factors which involve the deepwater conditions. This thesis investigates riser gas migration while drilling offshore wells using the EC-Drill? technology. EC-Drill? is a variation of Dual Gradient Drilling, where two fluid gradients are achieved by controlling the annular mud level in the riser via subsea pumps, voiding the top section to air, forming the two gradients; air in top section and drilling mud for the remaining fluid column, providing dynamic control of the Bottom Hole Pressure and improved drilling and well control capabilities, which reduce costs, non-productive time and create a safer drilling environment. However, one of the issues of voiding the riser to air in the EC-Drill? is that if a gas kick occurs or gas is drilled, then the gas entering the system will rise to the voided section of the riser creating a combustible mixture of gas and air below the rig floor, leading to devastating results such as equipment damage, losing the well, and even death. These results make it important to understand and mitigate the problem of gas migration. This study provides the design process of the experiment facility in which the gas migration study was performed and the preliminary tests that were done to study gas migration. The method of elimination that was proposed for the testing facility was called the ?top fill technique?, where additional drilling fluid is injected {{from the top of the}} riser in the annulus, causing a downward flow motion which is meant to prevent the gas from rising up. The injected drilling fluid is then returned to the rig floor through the EC-Pump mounted on the riser along with the gas. This method requires a priori knowledge of the amount of drilled gas, <b>mud</b> properties, <b>circulation</b> rates, the injection rate and the required downward flow which is obtained through experiments. To perform the necessary experiments a small-scale simulator was designed at the University Services Building at Texas A&M University, following the guidelines provided by the EC-Drill? Technology Providers and available literature. The model was scaled to 1 / 3 of actual riser size and initial tests were done using water to prove the successful design and installation of the equipment. Following this, the scaled model was prepared and calibrated to accommodate clear drilling mud to provide visual study of the gas migration phenomenon. However, due to the limitations of the pump rates and flow meters along with the use of water as a drilling mud, the tests were unsuccessful in fully mitigating the gas migration issue, leading to the need of upgrading the equipment that were used to run the tests...|$|R
40|$|Summary. As an {{alternative}} to finite element or finite difference modelling, analytical solutions are derived by the method of Laplace transformation and numerical results obtained for several models of the bottom hole temperature stabilization. Included in the models are the finite circulation time, the thermal property contrast between the borehole mud and the surrounding formation, {{and the presence of}} radial or lateral fluid flow in the formation, all of which are found to have significant effects on the dissipation of the thermal disturbance induced by drilling. The <b>mud</b> <b>circulation</b> is considered to have the effect of either maintaining the borehole mud a t a constant temperature or supplying a constant amount of heat per unit length per unit time to the borehole. For small circulation times, the former reduces to the ‘zero circulation ’ model in which the <b>mud</b> <b>circulation</b> creates an instantaneous temperature anomaly at the hole bottom; for small borehole radii, the latter reduces to the line source model and the traditional ‘Horner plot’. For typical drilling operations in which the bottom hole temperatures are measured several hours to several tens of hours after the hole is shut in, the new models generally predict higher equilibrium formation temperatures than does the Horner plot. However, predictions from the various models converge if the BHTs are taken after the hole has been shut in for a period which is greater than about five times the circulation period.

30|$|Under static {{conditions}} (before any production/injection or circulation), the reservoir temperature is stabilized at constant temperature which follows the geothermal gradient. In a dynamic process such as production, injection or during drilling <b>mud</b> <b>circulation,</b> the down-hole temperature changes. These changes take place under two processes: convection and conduction. After a stop of production/injection operation, down-hole well temperature is readjusted to stabilize reservoir temperature. This readjustment also happens under the convection/conduction heat transfer processes. Considering both conduction and convection processes simultaneously in calculations would just complicate the computations.

The electrical resistivity model from the Rittershoffen case study will be applied to previously collected and new data sets from other granite-hosted geothermal sites, such as at Soultz and Illkirch. Unlike temperature anomalies, the resistivity signature of a fracture zone can provide an accurate, quantitative estimate of the permeability of the granite. At Rittershoffen, an interesting correlation was observed between the depth extents of the temperature and resistivity anomalies. The fractures that contribute most to the actual well productivity are associated with localized anomalies in the geophysical logs. These fractures are also characterized by positive temperature anomalies that are interpreted as hot-water outflows in the well. In contrast, fractures in the deepest part of GRT- 2 seem to be plugged by small crystallites of illitic material and calcite due to past massive hydrothermal circulation. These fractures are characterized by broad anomalies in the geophysical logs.

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2005 Gas {{hydrates}} in the Alaska North Slope, with {{a potential}} of 590 TCF gas-in-place near existing infrastructures of Prudhoe Bay, Kuparuk River and Milne Point Units, have sparked interest among unconventional energy experts.

Moreover, the recent drive toward open hole completions and highly deviated or horizontal wells have emphasized the need for evaluation of drilling or completion fluids suitability from a perspective of formation damage.

40|$|A mud {{transport}} {{model for the}} Scheldt estuary is being developed. Its purpose is to support managers of the Scheldt estuary with the solution {{of a number of}} managerial issues. The model domain ranges from the tidal boundary at Gent down to the Belgian coastal cities of Nieuwpoort and Zeebrugge. The hydrodynamic simulations on which the mud {{transport model}} is based show realistic values for water levels, salinities and residual currents in the major part of the model domain. However, the propagation of the tidal wave is modelled less accurately upstream of Antwerp. Regarding the mud transport simulations, which are based on simple process formulations, it is shown that a satisfactory agreement is obtained between computed and observed concentration levels and their spatial and temporal variations. SPM levels in the Scheldt appear to be rather sensitive to the volume of harbour siltation and dumping, notably near Antwerp. The sediment budget computed by the model includes an unrealistically high residual sediment flux towards the North Sea. By enhancing the estuarine <b>mud</b> <b>circulation,</b> the modelled residual flux becomes smaller and agrees better with observation-based estimates. A longer hydrodynamic simulation period (presently up to 3 months) would help to analyse the sediment budget and seasonal dynamics in more detail...|$|E
