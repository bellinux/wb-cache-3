5|$|The {{invention}} of the Leclanché cell in 1866 and the subsequent improvement of the batteries containing <b>manganese</b> <b>dioxide</b> as cathodic depolarizer increased the demand of <b>manganese</b> <b>dioxide.</b> Until the development batteries with nickel-cadmium and lithium, most batteries contained manganese. The zinc-carbon battery and the alkaline battery normally use industrially produced <b>manganese</b> <b>dioxide</b> because natural occurring <b>manganese</b> <b>dioxide</b> contains impurities.

5|$|Because it {{was used}} in glassmaking, <b>manganese</b> <b>dioxide</b> was {{available}} for experiments by alchemists, the first chemists.

By the mid-18th century, the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele used <b>manganese</b> <b>dioxide</b> to produce chlorine. First, hydrochloric acid, or a mixture of dilute sulfuric acid and sodium chloride was made to react with <b>manganese</b> <b>dioxide,</b> later hydrochloric acid from the Leblanc process was used and the <b>manganese</b> <b>dioxide</b> was recycled by the Weldon process.

40|$|International audienceRelationships between lattice {{parameters}} of <b>manganese</b> <b>dioxides</b> and their surface properties at the solid–aqueous solution interface were investigated. The studied series ranged from ramsdellite to pyrolusite and encompassed disordered MD samples. The structural model used {{takes into account}} structural defects: Pr (rate of pyrolusite intergrowth) and Tw (rate of microtwinning). Water adsorption isotherms showed that the cross sectional area of water molecules adsorbed in the first monolayer is positively correlated to Pr. Titration of the surface charge of the MD series evidenced a positive linear relationship between the PZC and Pr (Pr= 0, Tw= 0, PZC= 1 for ramsdellite; Pr= 1, Tw= 0, PZC= 7. 3 for pyrolusite; γ-MD with intermediate values of Pr (0. 2 to 0. 45) have increasing PZC values). The rate of microtwinning appeared as a secondary factor for the increase of the PZC. The above correlations are explained by the chemical defects at {{the origin of the}} structural disorder, respectively Mn 3 + /Mn 4 + substitution for Pr and Mn vacancies for Tw, which result in proton affinity and thus in increased PZC.

The structures and morphologies of as-synthesized OMS- 2 nanowires and amorphous MnO 2 nanoparticles were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Electrochemical behaviors of the as-prepared nanocomposites with varying ratios were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge and potentiostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) using a three-electrode system in a 0. 5 M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution. Pure OMS nanowires exhibit a specific capacitance of about 37 F g - 1, and amorphous MnO 2 nanoparticles demonstrate relatively higher specific capacitance of about 106 F g - 1 at a scan rate of 2 mV s - 1. The enhancement of specific capacitance {{can be carried out}} by mixing OMS- 2 nanowires and amorphous MnO 2 nanoparticles to form nanocomposites and the optimized mole ratio of OMS- 2 nanowires to amorphous MnO 2 as 1 : 5 can be achieved.

5|$|Historically, {{manganese}} {{is named}} for pyrolusite and other black minerals from the region of Magnesia in Greece, which also gave its name to magnesium and the iron ore magnetite. By the mid-18th century, Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele had used pyrolusite to produce chlorine. Scheele and others were aware that pyrolusite (now known to be <b>manganese</b> <b>dioxide)</b> contained a new element, but {{they were unable to}} isolate it. Johan Gottlieb Gahn was the first to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in 1774, which he did by reducing the dioxide with carbon.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the name {{manganese}} is complex. In ancient times, two black minerals from Magnesia (located within modern Greece) were both called magnes from their place of origin, but were thought to differ in gender. The male magnes attracted iron, and was the iron ore now known as lodestone or magnetite, and which probably gave us the term magnet. The female magnes ore did not attract iron, but was used to decolorize glass. This feminine magnes was later called magnesia, known now in modern times as pyrolusite or <b>manganese</b> <b>dioxide.</b> Neither this mineral nor elemental manganese is magnetic. In the 16th century, <b>manganese</b> <b>dioxide</b> was called manganesum (note the two Ns instead of one) by glassmakers, possibly as a corruption and concatenation of two words, since alchemists and glassmakers eventually had to differentiate a magnesia negra (the black ore) from magnesia alba (a white ore, also from Magnesia, also useful in glassmaking). Michele Mercati called magnesia negra manganesa, and finally the metal isolated from it became known as manganese (German: Mangan). The name magnesia eventually was then used to refer only to the white magnesia alba (magnesium oxide), which provided the name magnesium for the free element when it was isolated much later.|$|E

Furthermore, the chemical compounds detected {{in the area around}} the explosion's point of origin were consistent with those generated by a dynamite explosion. The <b>manganese</b> <b>dioxide</b> samples collected from the seats near the focal point and from Frank's body indicated that a dry cell battery was located very near to the explosive. The CAB determined that, based on the blast pattern, a dynamite charge had been placed underneath the window seat of row 7.|$|E
40|$|Hydrothermal {{decomposition}} of permanganate, {{conducted in a}} range of pH-controlled solutions (from strongly acidic to strongly basic), is used to prepare <b>manganese</b> <b>dioxides</b> that are well-suited for use as supercapacitor electrode materials. While permanganate is thermodynamically unstable, the kinetics of its decomposition in an aqueous environment are very slow, until the temperature is raised to ~ 200 °C. Although the resultant materials are relatively crystalline and have low total pore volume, their prominent meso-porosity leads to good electrochemical performance.

A correlation is found between the shift of the (411) XRD peak and the magnetization behaviour. The results indicate that the magnetizability that is observed in these mostly α-phase containing samples can be accounted for by the average Mn-Mn distance and the consequent interactions between manganese spins mediated by O 2 - and OH-. Of particular interest to magnetic moments of MnO 2 samples with traces of δ phases is the prediction that the extent of the modification of the birnessite phase has a significant influenc...|$|R
5|$|A more {{progressive}} extraction process involves directly reducing manganese ore {{in a heap}} leach. This is done by percolating natural gas through {{the bottom of the}} heap; the natural gas provides the heat (needs to be at least 850°C) and the reducing agent (carbon monoxide). This reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide (MnO), which is a leachable form. The ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between 150–250 μm, increasing the surface area to aid leaching. The ore is then added to a leach tank of sulfuric acid and ferrous iron (Fe2+) in a 1.6:1 ratio. The iron reacts with the <b>manganese</b> <b>dioxide</b> to form iron hydroxide and elemental manganese. This process yields approximately 92% recovery of the manganese. For further purification, the manganese can then be sent to an electrowinning facility.|$|E

MnO 2 crystals were already used in water treatment, gas sensors, electrochemical supercapacitors, and so on. For example, hollow spherical and cubic MnO 2 nanostructures prepared by Kirkendall effect showed good ability to remove organic pollutants in waste water [3]. Cao et al. had prepared pillow-shaped MnO 2 crystals which could remove about 85 % of the Cd 2 + in waste water [4]. Zhang et al. had prepared MnO 2 hollow nanospheres and nanowires used for ammonia gas sensor [2]. MnO 2 hollow nanospheres were found to exhibit enhanced sensing performance to ammonia gas at room temperature compared with MnO 2 nanowires. Ma et al. had prepared urchin-shaped MnO 2 and clew-like-shaped MnO 2 used for electrochemical supercapacitors [6]. They found the electrochemical performances differed with various morphologies, and clew-like MnO 2 nanospheres had higher capacitance and lower charge-transfer resistance due to their incompact structure.
