5|$|No {{congressional hearing}} was convened to {{investigate}} the <b>misallocation</b> of funds by Powell, and neither Cope nor Marsh was held responsible for any of their mistakes, but some of Ballou's charges against Marsh came {{to be associated with}} the Survey. Facing anti-Survey sentiment inflamed by western drought and concerns about takeovers of abandoned western homesteads, Powell found himself the subject of larger scrutiny before the House Appropriations Committee. Galvanized to action by Marsh's perceived extravagance with Survey funds, the Appropriations Committee demanded the Survey's budget be itemized. When his appropriation was cut off in 1892, Powell sent a terse telegram to Marsh demanding his resignation, a personal slight as well as a financial one. At the same time, many of Marsh's allies were retiring or had died, lessening his scientific credence. Just as Marsh's extravagant lifestyle was catching up with him, Cope received a position on the Texas Geological Survey. Cope, still reeling from the personal attacks levied at him during the Herald affair, did not take advantage of the change in fortunes to press his personal attacks. Cope's fortunes continued to look up throughout the early 1890s, as he was promoted to Leidy's position as Professor of Zoology and was elected President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science the same year that Marsh stepped down as head of the Academy of Sciences. Towards the latter part of the decade, Cope's fortunes began to sour once more as Marsh regained some of his recognition, earning the Cuvier Medal, the highest paleontological award.|$|E
5|$|At Marsh's urging, Powell {{pushed for}} Cope to return {{specimens}} he had unearthed during his employment under the government surveys. This was an outrage to Cope, {{who had used}} his own money {{while working as a}} volunteer. In response, Cope went to the editor of the New York Herald and promised a scandalous headline. Since 1885, Cope had kept an elaborate journal of mistakes and misdeeds that both Marsh and Powell had committed over the years. From scientific errors to publishing mistakes, he had them written down in a journal he kept in the bottom drawer of his Pine Street desk. Cope sought out Marsh's assistants, who complained of being denied access and credit by their employer and of being chronically underpaid. Reporter William Hosea Ballou ran the first article on January 12, 1890, in what would become a series of newspaper debates between Marsh, Powell, and Cope. Cope attacked Marsh for plagiarism and financial mismanagement, and attacked Powell for his geological classification errors and misspending of government-allocated funds. Marsh and Powell published their own side of the story and, in the end, little changed. No congressional hearing was created to investigate Powell's alleged <b>misallocation</b> of funds, while Cope and Marsh were not held responsible for any mistakes. Indirectly, however, the attacks may have been influential in Marsh's fall from power in the survey. Due to pressure from Powell over bad press, Marsh was removed from his position for the government surveys. Cope's relations {{with the president of the}} University of Pennsylvania soured, and the entire funding for paleontology in the government surveys was pulled.|$|E
500|$|After {{the death}} of Stalin, the Soviet Union went {{through a process of}} moving away from Stalinist {{policies}} known as de-Stalinization. The purpose of de-Stalinization included not only ending the use of terror and the Gulag system that had existed under Stalin, but also reforming the economic policies of the Soviet Union. In the 1950s, the Soviet economy had begun to fall behind schedule in the output of several key materials including coal, iron and cement, and worker productivity was not growing at the rate expected. In May 1955, Pravda (the official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Communist Party) announced that a State Committee on Labour and Wages had been formed to investigate changes to wages and a centralised system of wage adjustments. In July 1955, Soviet Premier Nikolai Bulganin spoke of the need for Soviet industry to end outdated work quotas and reform wages, so that the Soviet Union could better incentivise workers and reduce labour turnover. The subsequent sixth Five-Year Plan for 1956 to 1960 included calls for a reform of wages. [...] The reforms had several objectives, the most important of which was to create a more consistent system of incentives for workers. It was also hoped that the reforms would help to reduce the levels of waste and <b>misallocation</b> of labour that were frequently found in Soviet industry.|$|E
40|$|We {{construct}} a cash-credit model with positive externalities {{in the production}} of credit goods. It is shown that under suitable conditions, the Friedman rule is not optimal and there exists an optimal nominal interest rate that maximizes the social welfare and output. This is because increasing the nominal interest rate improves sectoral <b>misallocations</b> caused by externalities in our economy...|$|R

Policy implications are also suggested...|$|R
40|$|Benefit cost ratios (BCR) {{have been}} applied to {{conservation}} decisions for two reasons: cost-efficiency and transparency in decision making. Because BCRs are ratios of benefits to costs, the uncertainties associated with the two components (benefits and costs) are compounded. Therefore, BCRs can potentially involve more uncertainty than allocation strategies based solely on maximizing benefits. The robustness of decisions, defined here as the inverse {{of the number of}} <b>misallocations</b> due to uncertainties in benefits and costs of projects, is an unexplored component of applying BCRs to conservation decision making. To investigate the robustness to uncertainty of conservation investment with BCRs, we developed an information-gap model (info-gap) for using BCRs in selecting "portfolios" of conservation projects. Our model allows us to explore how uncertain we can be in our estimates of benefit and cost parameters while still selecting a portfolio that performs better than a critical threshold of <b>misallocations</b> perceived to be unacceptable. We first give a full theoretical description of our info-gap model formulation and then explore applications of the model to several hypothetical data sets. 9 page(s...|$|R
2500|$|The Austrian {{theory of}} the {{business}} cycle [...] ("ABCT") focuses on banks' issuance of credit {{as the cause of}} economic fluctuations. Although later elaborated by Hayek and others, the theory was first set forth by Mises, who believed that banks extend credit at artificially low interest rates, causing businesses to invest in relatively roundabout production processes. [...] Mises stated that this led to a <b>misallocation</b> of resources which he called malinvestment.|$|E
2500|$|The U.S. State Department {{has argued}} that during the {{economic}} depression [...] "the Cuban government made a deliberate decision to continue to spend money to maintain its military and internal security apparatus {{at the expense of}} other priorities – including healthcare." [...] However, one study found that [...] "the available data show that the fall in Cuba's medicine imports in the '90s didn't correspond to a significant lowering of the government's healthcare spending. Budgetary support for peso-denominated spending – i.e., labor costs of medical professionals, operational costs of hospitals and clinics – has remained strong. Attempts to blame medical shortages in Cuba on resource <b>misallocation</b> are thus misguided, or at least wrongly nuanced." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hayek's {{principal}} {{investigations in}} economics concerned capital, money, {{and the business}} cycle. Mises had earlier applied the concept of marginal utility {{to the value of}} money in his Theory of Money and Credit (1912), in which he also proposed an explanation for [...] "industrial fluctuations" [...] based on the ideas of the old British Currency School and of Swedish economist Knut Wicksell. Hayek used this body of work {{as a starting point for}} his own interpretation of the business cycle, elaborating what later became known as the [...] "Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle". Hayek spelled out the Austrian approach in more detail in his book, published in 1929, an English translation of which appeared in 1933 as Monetary Theory and the Trade Cycle. There he argued for a monetary approach to the origins of the cycle. In his Prices and Production (1931), Hayek argued that the business cycle resulted from the central bank's inflationary credit expansion and its transmission over time, leading to a capital <b>misallocation</b> caused by the artificially low interest rates. Hayek claimed that [...] "the past instability of the market economy is the consequence of the exclusion of the most important regulator of the market mechanism, money, from itself being regulated by the market process".|$|E
40|$|One main result {{about the}} welfare effects of third-degree price {{discrimination}} by a monopolist {{is that an}} increase in total output is {{a necessary condition for}} welfare improvement. This note provides two examples showing that this proposition cannot be generalized to an oligopoly with heterogenous firms. In these examples, price discrimination makes competition more favorable to the low cost firm. This fact induces a cost saving that overcome the welfare loss from consumer <b>misallocations</b> associated to price discrimination...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} cost {{of capital}} <b>misallocations</b> between the corporate sector and the noncorporate sector is typically measured using statutory tax differences. Corporate-source income tax compliance is high because of third party reporting, however, while noncorporate rental income tax compliance is low. Differential evasion thus exacerbates statutory differences and enlarges the efficiency cost. To measure this effect, we build a numerical general equilibrium model where households simultaneously choose portfolios of risky assets and fractions of income to report. ...|$|R

40|$|We exploit an {{exogenous}} shock to corporate ownership structures {{created by a}} recent tax reform in Germany to explore the causal link between corporate governance and internal capital markets. We find that firms with more concentrated ownership are less diversified and have a less active but more efficient internal capital market. Our findings provide direct {{evidence in support of}} Scharfstein and Stein's (2000) model, which suggests that internal capital <b>misallocations</b> are partly a result of poor corporate governance. We also provide evidence of a channel through which the benefits of ownership concentration outweigh its costs...|$|R

We show that differences across countries {{in the degree of}} fiscal decen-tralization can contribute to this divergent outcome. The paper first employs Sachs and Warner’s cross-sectional data and finds support for the novel hypoth-esis. Then, it constructs a new panel-data sample that confirms the results. We also offer a theory of inter-regional tax competition that rationalizes the find-ings. The theory emphasizes <b>misallocations</b> caused by the lack of co-movement of labor and capital towards less agglomerated and more isolated areas where natural riches are located...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study how early-exit options, {{embedded}} in long-term procurement contracts {{which do not}} provide for sufficiently strong incentives against contract breach, can affect bidding behaviors in multidimensional procurement auctions and the parties' expected payoffs. We show first that bidders' payoff is lower when competing for contracts with unenforceable contract terms. Secondly, that neglecting the risk of opportunistic behavior by sellers can lead to contract awards that do not maximize the buyer's potential payoff. Finally, we make suggestions about how to mitigate potential <b>misallocations,</b> by pointing out the role of eligibility rules and competition among bidders...|$|R

Slight <b>misallocations</b> and dislocations due to the rushed final fixing had far reaching consequences in later editions of the famous Hyperides text until now.

40|$|Review {{coordinated by}} Steve McCorriston The 2003 CAP reform {{introduced}} decoupled income transfers as a prominent policy instrument. However, member states were given discretion over the degree {{and timing of}} the reform implementation. As a result, different implementation schemes coexist, keeping {{certain parts of the}} income support coupled. This coexistence leads to distortions of production incentives, factor <b>misallocations</b> and artificial trade flows. Here, we examine these effects in the beef sector where full decoupling was not obliga-tory. We derive a sector-specific trade model {{to examine the effects of}} different imple-mentation schemes on intra-European calf trade.

40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} {{impression}} management in accounting communication. Impression management entails {{the construction of}} an impression by organisations with the intention to appeal to their audiences, including shareholders, stakeholders, the general public, and the media. If successful, it undermines the quality of financial reporting and capital <b>misallocations</b> may result. What is more, wider social and political consequences include unwarranted support by non-financial stakeholders or by society at large. Impression management is examined by reference to four perspectives: the economic, psychological, sociological, and critical. These variously conceptualise impression management as reporting bias, self-serving bias, symbolic management, and ideological bias...|$|R

40|$|Albeit the {{relevance}} of property rights is well known, their determinants are still poorly understood. When property is fully protected, some buyers with valuation {{higher than that of}} original owners are inefficiently excluded from trade due to transaction costs. When protection of property is weak, low-valuation buyers inefficiently expropriate original owners. The trade-off between these two <b>misallocations</b> implies that property rights will be stronger the more dispersed buyers' preferences are.
