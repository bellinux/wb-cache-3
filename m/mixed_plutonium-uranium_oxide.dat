50|$|In 1965 Kerr-McGee {{received}} a Nuclear Regulatory Commission license to make nuclear fuel at the plant. The NRC license numbers were SNM-928 for the Uranium production and SNM-1174 for <b>mixed</b> <b>Plutonium-Uranium</b> <b>Oxide</b> (MOX) production.|$|E
50|$|The {{nuclear fuel}} was {{replaced}} for the restart. The original fuel loaded was <b>mixed</b> <b>plutonium-uranium</b> <b>oxide</b> with plutonium content of around 15-20%, but by 2009, due to natural radioactive decay, the fuel had {{only half of}} the original plutonium-241 content. This made achieving criticality impossible, requiring fuel replacement.|$|E
50|$|In about 1965 Kerr-McGee started {{producing}} uranium fuel at its Cimarron Fuel Fabrication Site. This {{was located}} near the Cimarron River and Crescent, Oklahoma. From 1973-1975 it would also produce <b>mixed</b> <b>Plutonium-Uranium</b> <b>Oxide</b> (MOX) 'driver fuel pins' {{for use in the}} Fast Flux Test Facility at the Hanford Site in Washington State. The plant shut down in 1976.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to provide {{information}} and identify parameters relevant to assessing the consequences to man and his environment of large scale <b>mixed</b> <b>plutonium-uranium</b> <b>oxide</b> fuel fabrication plants which will be needed in the next 10 to 15 years. The report identifies the pertinent parameters, values, factors and methods which may be used in evaluating the environmental consequences of routine plant operation as well as postulated accidents.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{postulated}} that a degradation phenomenon, {{referred to as}} ``hot cell rot``, may affect irradiated FFTF <b>mixed</b> <b>plutonium-uranium</b> <b>oxide</b> (MOX) fuel during dry interim storage. ``Hot cell rot`` refers {{to a variety of}} phenomena that degrade fuel pin cladding during exposure to air and inert gas environments. It is thought to be a form of caustic stress corrosion cracking or environmentally assisted cracking. Here, a criticality safety analysis was performed to address the effect of the ``hot cell rot`` phenomenon on the long term storage of irradiated FFTF fuel in core component containers. The results show that seven FFTF fuel assemblies or six Ident- 69 pin containers stored in core component containers within interim storage casks will remain safely subcritical...|$|E
40|$|The Plutonium Finishing Plant (PFP) was {{constructed}} {{as part of}} the Manhattan Project during World War II. The Manhattan Project was developed to usher in the use of nuclear weapons to end the war. The primary mission of the PFP was to provide plutonium used as special nuclear material (SNM) for fabrication of nuclear devices for the war effort. Subsequent to the end of World War II, the PFP's mission expanded to support the Cold War effort through plutonium production during the nuclear arms race and later the processing of fuel grade <b>mixed</b> <b>plutonium-uranium</b> <b>oxide</b> to support DOE's breeder reactor program. In October 1990, {{at the close of the}} production mission for PFP, a shutdown order was prepared by the Department of Energy (DOE) in Washington, DC and issued to the Richland DOE field office. Subsequent to the shutdown order, a team from the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB) analyzed the hazards at PFP associated with the continued storage of certain forms of plutonium solutions and solids. The assessment identified many discrete actions that were required to stabilize the different plutonium forms into stable form and repackage the material in high integrity containers. These actions were technically complicated and completed {{as part of the}} PFP nuclear material stabilization project between 1995 and early 2005. The completion of the stabilization project was a necessary first step in deactivating PFP. During stabilization, DOE entered into negotiations with the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the State of Washington and established milestones for the Deactivation and Decommissioning (D&D) of the PFP. The DOE and its contractor, Fluor Hanford (Fluor), have made great progress in deactivating, decontaminating and decommissioning the PFP at the Hanford Site as detailed in this paper. Background information covering the PFP D&D effort includes descriptions of negotiations with the State of Washington concerning consent-order milestones, milestones completed to date, and the vision of bringing PFP to slab-on-grade. Innovative approaches in planning and regulatory strategies, as well new technologies from within the United States and from other countries and field decontamination techniques developed by workforce personnel, such as the ''turkey roaster'' and the ''lazy Susan'' are covered in detail in the paper. Critical information on issues and opportunities during the performance of the work such as concerns regarding the handling and storage of special nuclear material, concerns regarding criticality safety and the impact of SNM de-inventory at PFP are also provided. The continued success of the PFP D&D effort is due to the detailed, yet flexible, approach to planning that applied innovative techniques and tools, involved a team of experienced independent reviewers, and incorporated previous lessons learned at the Hanford site, Rocky Flats, and commercial nuclear D&D projects. Multi-disciplined worker involvement in the planning and the execution of the work has produced a committed workforce that has developed innovative techniques, resulting in safer and more efficient work evolutions...|$|E
2500|$|On 27 December 2011 {{a lawsuit}} was started against Kyūshū Electric Power Company by 290 local residents. Most of them {{living in the}} prefectures Saga and Fukuoka. They said that the {{disaster}} in Fukushima had made it clear, that an accident at the Genkai-plant caused by a possible earthquake or tsunami could damage the lives and health of the people living nearby. They questioned in particular {{the safety of the}} 36-year-old nr. 1 reactor near the sea. Kyushu Electric commented, that it would examine the suit and would act [...] "appropriately." [...] This was already the third time that locals tried to stop this plant. Because in July 2011 90 people asked the local court for an injunction order to stop the nr. 2 and nr. 3 Genkai-reactors from going back online, like was done in August 2010 when about 130 local residents and others demanded from the district court to halt to the use of <b>plutonium-uranium</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>oxide</b> fuel, or MOX, at the No. 3 Genkai-reactor.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{critical}} experiments was completed with mixed plutoniumuranium solutions having Pu/(Pu + U) ratios of approximately 0. 2 and 1. 0. These experiments {{were a part}} of the Criticality Data Development Program between the United States Department of Energy (USDOE), and the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation (PNC) of Japan. A complete description of, and data from, the experiments are included in this report. The experiments were performed with <b>mixed</b> <b>plutonium-uranium</b> solutions in annular cylindrical geometry. The measurements were made with a water reflector. The central region included a concrete, polyethylene or void annular cylindrical insert. Interior to the insert was a stainless steel bottle containing plutonium-uranium solution or a void region. In one experiment the central region was filled with a solid cadmium-covered polyethylene insert. The concentration of the solution in the annular region was varied from 61 to 489 g (Pu + U) /liter. The ratio of plutonium to total heavy metal (plutonium plus uranium) was 0. 22 or 0. 97 for all experiments...|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} computational {{results of}} an extensive study to examine the following: (1) infinite media neutron-multiplication factors; (2) material bucklings; (3) bounding infinite media critical concentrations; (4) bounding finite critical dimensions of water-reflected and homogeneously water-moderated one-dimensional systems (i. e., spheres, cylinders of infinite length, and slabs that are infinite in two dimensions) that were comprised of various proportions and densities of plutonium oxides and uranium oxides, each having various isotopic compositions; and (5) sensitivity coefficients of delta k-eff with respect to critical geometry delta dimensions were determined {{for each of the}} three geometries that were studied. The study was undertaken to support the development of a standard that is sponsored by the International Standards Organization (ISO) under Technical Committee 85, Nuclear Energy (TC 85) [...] Subcommittee 5, Nuclear Fuel Technology (SC 5) [...] Working Group 8, Standardization of Calculations, Procedures and Practices Related to Criticality Safety (WG 8).
