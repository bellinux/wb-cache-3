5|$|The wind enables this moderating effect. The {{windward}} {{side of a}} land mass experiences more moderation than the leeward side.

5|$|Asperger {{syndrome}} (AS), {{also known}} as Asperger's, is a developmental disorder characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. As a <b>milder</b> autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it differs from other ASDs by relatively normal language and intelligence. Although not required for diagnosis, physical clumsiness and unusual use of language are common. Signs usually begin before two years old and typically last for a person's entire life.|$|E

The first two conditions involve a viral infection and are generally <b>milder</b> with respect to symptomatology; the last four are due to bacterial infection and are usually of greater severity.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) and {{ulcerative}} colitis (UC) are potentially progressive diseases. Few {{data are available}} on the prevalence and the factors associated with <b>mild</b> inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). AIM: Our aim was to assess the natural history of <b>mild</b> CD and <b>mild</b> UC and to identify predictive factors of <b>mild</b> evolution over the long term. METHODS: Retrospective study of IBD patients registered in the database of the university hospital CHU of Liege, Belgium. <b>Mild</b> CD was defined as an inflammatory luminal disease (no stricture, abdominal or perianal fistulae) requiring no immunomodulator (IM), anti-TNF and no surgery. <b>Mild</b> UC was defined as no requirement for IM, anti-TNF and no colectomy. RESULTS: Four hundred and seventy-three CD and 189 UC were included (median follow-up: 13 and 11 years respectively). At 1 year, 147 patients had <b>mild</b> CD. At 5 years and the maximum follow-up, 56 % and 13 % patients still had <b>mild</b> CD, respectively. At 1 year, 142 patients had <b>mild</b> UC. At 5 years and the maximum follow-up, 72 % and 44 % still had a <b>mild</b> UC, respectively. Factors associated with long-term <b>mild</b> CD and UC were older age at diagnosis and absence of corticosteroids in the first year. In UC proctitis location was associated with <b>mild</b> UC. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, 90 % of CD patients and 3 / 4 of UC with <b>mild</b> disease at 1 year lost their <b>mild</b> disease status over time. An old age at diagnosis was predictive of the persistence of a <b>mild</b> CD and UC. Peer reviewe...|$|R

5|$|Subclinical {{hypothyroidism}} is a <b>milder</b> form of hypothyroidism {{characterized by}} an elevated serum TSH level, but with a normal serum free thyroxine level. This <b>milder</b> form of hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by Hashimoto's thyroiditis. In adults it is diagnosed when TSH levels are greater than 5 mIU/L and less than 10mIU/L. The presentation of subclinical hypothyroidism is variable and classic {{signs and symptoms of}} hypothyroidism may not be observed. Of people with subclinical hypothyroidism, a proportion will develop overt hypothyroidism each year. In those with detectable antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO), this occurs in 4.3%, while in those with no detectable antibodies, this occurs in 2.6%. Those with subclinical hypothyroidism and detectable anti-TPO antibodies who do not require treatment should have repeat thyroid function tests more frequently (e.g. yearly) compared with those who do not have antibodies.|$|E
5|$|Sweet onions have {{a greater}} water and sugar content than cooking onions. This makes them sweeter and <b>milder</b> tasting, but reduces their shelf life. Sweet onions can be stored refrigerated; they have a shelf life of around 1 month. Irrespective of type, any cut pieces of onion are best tightly wrapped, stored away from other produce, and used within two to three days.|$|E

5|$|The lake {{within the}} park is at an {{elevation}} of about , and the park itself sits in a natural basin. The basin and the underlying sandstone trap water and thus form the lake and surrounding bogs.

5|$|The {{song thrush}} breeds {{in most of}} Europe (although not in {{the greater part of}} Iberia, lowland Italy or {{southern}} Greece), and across the Ukraine and Russia almost to Lake Baikal. It reaches to 75°N in Norway, but only to about 60°N in Siberia.

5|$|A {{person with}} Tourette's has about a 50% chance of passing the gene(s) {{to one of}} his or her children, but Tourette's is a {{condition}} of variable expression and incomplete penetrance. Thus, not everyone who inherits the genetic vulnerability will show symptoms; even close family members may show different severities of symptoms, or no symptoms at all. The gene(s) may express as Tourette's, as a <b>milder</b> tic disorder (provisional or chronic tics), or as obsessive–compulsive symptoms without tics. Only a minority of the children who inherit the gene(s) have symptoms severe enough to require medical attention. Gender appears to have a role in the expression of the genetic vulnerability: males are more likely than females to express tics.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} rest of South West England, Portishead has a {{temperate}} climate generally wetter and <b>milder</b> than the rest of England. The annual mean temperature is about 10°C (50°F) with seasonal and diurnal variations, but the modifying effect of the sea restricts the range to less than that in most other parts of the United Kingdom. January is the coldest month, with mean minimum temperatures between 1°C (34°F) and 2°C (36°F). July and August are the warmest, with mean daily maxima around 21°C (70°F). In general, December is the dullest month and June the sunniest. The south-west of England enjoys a favoured location, particularly in summer, when the Azores High extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK.|$|E
