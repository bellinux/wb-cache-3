5|$|During the 1990s, the Eurasian {{integration}} process was slow, possibly {{due to the}} economic crisis experienced after {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union {{and the size of the}} countries involved (Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan cover an area of about 20 million km²). As a result, numerous treaties have been signed by <b>member</b> <b>states</b> <b>to</b> establish the regional trading bloc gradually.|$|E
5|$|Many {{regional}} {{international organisations}} such as the European Free Trade Association, Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) set English as their organisation's sole working language even though most members are not countries with a majority of native English speakers. While the European Union (EU) allows <b>member</b> <b>states</b> <b>to</b> designate any of the national languages as an official language of the Union, in practice English is the main working language of EU organisations.|$|E

5|$|The 1992 Maastricht Treaty obliges most EU <b>member</b> <b>states</b> <b>to</b> {{adopt the}} euro upon meeting certain {{monetary}} and budgetary convergence criteria, {{although not all}} states have done so. The United Kingdom and Denmark negotiated exemptions, while Sweden (which joined the EU in 1995, after the Maastricht Treaty was signed) turned down the euro in a 2003 referendum, and has circumvented the obligation to adopt the euro by not meeting the monetary and budgetary requirements. All nations that have joined the EU since 1993 have pledged to adopt the euro in due course.|$|E
5|$|The European Council {{consists}} of the heads of state or government of the member states, alongside its own President and the Commission President (both non-voting). The meetings used to be regularly attended by the national foreign minister as well, and the Commission President likewise accompanied by {{another member of the}} Commission. However, since the Treaty of Lisbon, this has been discontinued, as the size of the body had become somewhat large following successive accessions of new <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> <b>to</b> the Union.|$|E
5|$|The European Parliament {{periodically}} commissions {{opinion polls}} and studies on public opinion trends in <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> <b>to</b> survey perceptions {{and expectations of}} citizens about its work and the overall activities of the European Union.

Eurobarometer analyses seek to provide an overall picture of national situations, regional specificities, socio-demographic cleavages, and historical trends.|$|E

5|$|Task of {{developing}} a constitution for the nation was undertaken by the Constituent Assembly of India, composing of elected representatives. The Constituent Assembly first met on December 9, 1946 under the presidency of Dr. Sachidanand later Dr. Rajendra Prasad was made its President. While members of Congress composed of a large majority, Congress leaders appointed persons from diverse political backgrounds to responsibilities {{of developing}} the constitution and national laws. Notably, Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar became the chairperson of the drafting committee, while Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel became chairpersons of committees and sub-committees responsible for different subjects. A notable development during that period having {{significant effect on the}} Indian constitution took place on 10 December 1948 when the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and called upon all <b>member</b> <b>states</b> <b>to</b> adopt these rights in their respective constitutions.|$|E

5|$|The Athenians {{had also}} been {{preparing}} for war with the Persians since the mid-480s BC, and in 482 BC the decision was taken, {{under the guidance of}} the Athenian politician Themistocles, to build a massive fleet of triremes that would be necessary for the Greeks to fight the Persians. However, the Athenians did not have the manpower to fight on land and sea; and therefore combating the Persians would require an alliance of Greek city states. In 481 BC, Xerxes sent ambassadors around Greece asking for earth and water, but making the very deliberate omission of Athens and Sparta. Support thus began to coalesce around these two leading states. A congress of city states met at Corinth in late autumn of 481 BC, and a confederate alliance of Greek city-states was formed. It had the power to send envoys asking for assistance and to dispatch troops from the <b>member</b> <b>states</b> <b>to</b> defensive points after joint consultation. This was remarkable for the disjointed Greek world, especially since many of the city-states in attendance were still technically at war with each other.|$|E

5|$|The Korean War began {{early in}} the morning of 25 June 1950, {{following}} the surprise invasion of the Republic of Korea (ROK) by its northern neighbour, the communist Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). Numerically superior and better-equipped, the Korean People's Army (KPA) crossed the 38th Parallel and rapidly advanced south, easily overcoming the South Koreans. In response, the United Nations (UN) decided to intervene on behalf of South Korea, inviting <b>member</b> <b>states</b> <b>to</b> send forces to restore the situation. As a consequence, American ground forces were hastily deployed in an attempt to prevent the South Koreans from collapsing, however they too were under strength and poorly equipped, and by early August had been forced back by the North Koreans to an enclave around Pusan, known as the Pusan Perimeter. Key US allies—Britain, Canada and Australia—also committed forces, although these were initially limited to naval contingents and were largely viewed as token efforts in the US. Under diplomatic pressure the British agreed to deploy an infantry brigade in July, and would later dispatch a second brigade as the crisis worsened. The Canadians also agreed to provide an infantry brigade, although the first battalion would not arrive until December 1950. A total of 21 UN member states eventually contributed forces.|$|E
