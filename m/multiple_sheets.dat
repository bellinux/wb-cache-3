500|$|Concept {{development}} on Human Revolution began in early 2007, {{shortly after the}} founding of Eidos Montréal. The team at this point was fairly small, consisting of producer David Anfossi, director Jean-François Dugas, senior designer François Lapikas, and art director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête. The early period was devoted to research before performing brainstorming sessions to create the game's basic concepts. One of the concepts established early on {{was that it would}} be an ambitious project and they needed to bring the key staff on board as early as possible. They started with playing the first two games, determining what they liked and disliked about the original Deus Ex, and how they could carry over or improve these points. An early decision was to remain true to the series' core values, despite Human Revolution being essentially a series reboot. When presenting their project to Eidos management, they presented <b>multiple</b> <b>sheets</b> of their concept, and after two days the game was green-lit. The entire main staff were newcomers to the Deus Ex series, providing a large challenge to the development team as a whole. During the early design process, {{one of the things that}} worked well was the blueprint testing process and cutting items that would either not fit into the game or would make the project too large to handle. The most difficult period for the development team was the opening two-year period, which was described as a [...] "vertical slice" [...] through the game concepts, when they were trying to bring a piece of Human Revolution to retail quality before extending that out across the whole game.|$|E

In order to provide a large workspace, conventional spreadsheets extend a table in X and Y to form a very large grid - ideally infinite, but normally limited to some smaller dimension. Some of these cells, selected by the user, hold data. Data is manipulated using formulas, which are placed in other cells in the same sheet and output their results back into the formula cell's display. The rest of the sheet is [...] "sparse", currently unused. Sheets often grow very complex with input data, intermediate values from formulas and output areas, separated by blank areas. In order to manage this complexity, Excel allows one to hide data that is not of interest, often intermediate values. Quattro Pro commonly introduced the idea of <b>multiple</b> <b>sheets</b> in a single book, allowing further subdivision of the data.|$|E

40|$|The vortex-in-cell is {{developed}} to simulate an axisymmetric round jet {{with and without}} coflow. For an incompressible and viscous jet, the method consists in three fractional steps. The first fractional step describes the convection of interacting vortex elements. The second and third fractional steps simulate the diffusion of vorticity using the diffusion velocity method and the deterministic diffusion, respectively. For the jet with no coflow, the methodology is tested by initializing the vorticity field with one vortex <b>sheet,</b> <b>multiple</b> vortex <b>sheets</b> and with the Stokes stream function using one and <b>multiple</b> vortex <b>sheets.</b> Two inflow profiles are tested, the top hat profile and the jet self similar profiles. The sensitivity of the results {{to the number of}} vortex elements and grid size are presented and compared. Also, the effect of perturbing the top hat inflow velocity profile is investigated. The jet with coflow is investigated using top hat inflow velocity profile with one and <b>multiple</b> vortex <b>sheets.</b> The mean centerline velocity, streamwise mean velocity profile, vorticity contour, instantaneous distribution of vortex elements, root-mean-square longitudinal and lateral velocity fluctuations, cross-stream correlation are presented. The results are compared with previous experimental measurements and numerical simulation using vortex method...|$|R

50|$|Complex tubes can be {{made from}} <b>multiple</b> <b>sheet</b> {{components}} formed and welded together, but this adds unnecessary cost and creates quality concerns at the joints. Hydroforming uses liquid under extreme pressures to form metal tubes. It was developed for the plumbing industry and by 1990 achieved production efficiencies suited for high volume autos. Typically hydroforming is done at ambient temperatures, and limits the forming elongation of metals to 8‐12% diameter increase for aluminum, and 25‐40% for steel. This limits the part shape complexity that can be produced. In addition, the workcenters and tooling can be large and expensive because of the internal fluid pressures required to form ambient tubes. HMGF is able to form tubes with larger shape complexity in only one forming step and generally at a lower internal pressure than in conventional tube hydroforming.|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of spark-ignited flame kernels in a turbulent field is strongly {{dependent upon the}} nature of the three-dimensional (3 -D) turbulence adjacent to the ignition source. The turbulence scales vary in 3 -D from shot to shot, resulting in successive flame kernels developing differently and thereby causing cyclic variations in, for example, spark ignition engines. It is necessary to quantify the scales affecting the flame at any instant for the accurate measurement of burn rate of such flame kernels, which requires visualization of the flame surface in 3 -D. The experiments reported here employ a <b>multiple</b> <b>sheet</b> mie-scattered light technique to successfully characterize a nonstabilized expanding turbulent flame kernel in 3 -D. A novel algorithm was developed to construct the flame surface in 3 -D, which enabled accurate calculation of parameters such as flame surface density, reaction progress variables, and turbulent flame thickness...|$|R
40|$|The delta-phase of the {{syndiotactic}} polystyrene/ethylbenzene system, as {{formed by}} crystallisation from dilute solution, {{is shown to}} result in a lamellar morphology, with a monoclinic crystal lattice similar to that already reported for the complex with toluene. Combined SAXS, FTi. r., d. s. c. and t. g. a. measurements show that an increase in the X-ray long period between 80 and 120 degrees C is related to solvent loss and decomplexation. There is also some temporary loss in helical order. SANS measurements on the delta-phase reveal negligible isotopic fractionation. The small increase in the in-plane radius of gyration with increasing molecular weight is interpreted as evidence of a sheetlike molecular conformation, with superfolding at higher molecular weights leading to a <b>multiple</b> <b>sheet</b> structure. On transformation to the solvent-free gamma-phase, an increase in radius of gyration results from a displacement of crystal stems out of the delta-phase sheets. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{describes}} three mid-Tertiary intrusions {{from the}} Henry Mountains (Utah, USA) that were assembled from amalgamation of multiple horizontal sheet-like magma pulses {{in the absence}} of regional deformation. The three-dimensional intrusion geometries are exceptionally well preserved and include: (1) a highly lobate sill; (2) a laccolith; and (3) a bysmalith (a cylindrical, fault-bounded, piston-like laccolith). Individual intrusive sheets are recognised on the margins of the bodies by stacked lobate contacts, and within the intrusions by both intercalated sedimentary wallrock and formation of solid-state fabrics. Finally, conduits feeding these intrusions were mostly sub-horizontal and pipe-like, as determined by both direct observation and modelling of geophysical data. The intrusion geometries, in aggregate, are interpreted to reflect the time evolution of an idealised upper crustal pluton. These intrusions initiate as sills, evolve into laccoliths, and eventually become piston-like bysmaliths. The emplacement of <b>multiple</b> magma <b>sheets</b> was rapid and pulsed; the largest intrusion was assembled in less than 100 years. The magmatic fabrics are interpreted as recording the internal flow of the sheets preserved by fast cooling rates in the upper crust. Because there are <b>multiple</b> magma <b>sheets,</b> fabrics may vary vertically as different sheets are traversed. These bodie...|$|R
40|$|Resistance weld surface {{appearance}} can be critical in applications where the outer surface is exposed. The joining of <b>multiple</b> <b>sheet</b> stack-ups can exhibit electrode indentation deformation to the worksheets at the electrode-work surface interface requiring rework. The deformation {{is due to}} heat input and electrode force. With the emergence of advanced high strength steels (AHSS), weld forces and heat input {{have had to be}} increased, leading to an increased tendency for indentation. Limiting the extent of electrode indentation is traditionally managed by controlling the heat balance and electrode size. Shifting the heat balance of the weld can lead to loss of weld quality and size. Indirect resistance projection welding is able to manage the heat generation on a sensitive surface while focusing the heat to the faying surface. Investigation of a specific hem weld geometry using AHSS was carried out using three proposed projection geometries. SORPAS ® resistance welding simulation software was used to model the physical deformation as well as heat generation and weld nugget growth. Projection geometry design was compared and optimized by simulation to maximize the size of the weld nugget while minimizing the deformation experienced on the outer surface...|$|R
