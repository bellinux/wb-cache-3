40|$|This paper aims {{to provide}} an {{introduction}} to a basic form of the Q-tensor approach to <b>modelling</b> <b>liquid</b> crystals, which has seen increased interest in recent years. The increase in interest {{in this type of}} modelling approach has been driven by investigations into the fundamental nature of defects and new applications of liquid crystals such as bistable displays and colloidal systems for which a description of defects and disorder is essential. The work in this paper is not new research, rather it is an introductory guide for anyone wishing to model a system using such a theory. A more complete mathematical description of this theory, including a description of flow effects, can be found in numerous sources but the books by Virga and Sonnet and Virga are recommended. More information can be obtained from the plethora of papers using such approaches, although a general introduction for the novice is lacking. The first few sections of this paper will detail the development of the Q-tensor approach for nematic liquid crystalline systems and construct the free energy and governing equations for the mesoscopic dependent variables.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this work is to investigate the effects that an absorber's shape has on its control performance, particularly during circumstances of large structural displacements. In such conditions, violent fluid behaviour is observed at the free-surface. Such behaviour {{is known to be}} responsible for dissipating large amounts of structural energy (Marsh et al., 2009), and is therefore a desirable phenomenon. Potential enhancements are explored, with shapes different than a rectangle, through numerical investigation. The relationship between container shape and fluid behaviour is assessed. Due to complex free-surface behaviour, Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is used as a numerical modelling tool in this study. SPH is a Lagrangian method for solving the equations of fluid flow. It is suitable for <b>modelling</b> <b>liquid</b> sloshing due to its grid free nature, and inherent ability to capture free-surface behaviour accurately (Monaghan, 1992). SPH has been successfully applied {{to a wide range of}} industrial fluid flow applications involving complex geometries in many instances (Cleary et al., 2007 a, Cleary et al., 2007 b, Cleary et al., 2002, Cleary et al., 2006 and Marsh et al., 2009). In order to validate the predictions of fluid–structure interaction with the SPH model, simple experimental observations (Marsh, 2009) are also presented here.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the influence of <b>modeling</b> <b>liquids</b> on the translucency and color shade of resin composites (RCs) after one year of storage. RC specimens were prepared using either a conventional insertion technique (control; without <b>modeling</b> <b>liquid)</b> or a restorative dental modeling insertion technique (RDMIT) with dental adhesives as <b>modeling</b> <b>liquids</b> (Scotchbond™ Multi-Purpose [SBMP; 3 M ESPE] or Adper™ Single Bond 2 [SB; 3 M ESPE]). The initial colors of the specimens were obtained with a digital spectrophotometer and the CIEL*a*b* color system, after which specimens were stored (37 °C) in distilled water or red wine for 12 months. Color measurements were reassessed after 6 and 12 months of storage, and scanning electron microscopy was performed after 12 months. Translucency and color change (ΔE*) were calculated and analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey’s test (α = 5 %). RC samples prepared via RDMIT showed a translucency similar to that of control samples. ΔE* was also less intense for RCs containing SBMP than for RCs containing SB. Specimens stored in wine showed a clear pattern of degradation, especially in the control group, and surface degradation seemed to be less intense for specimens prepared with SBMP and SB than for specimens without. Specimens stored in water did not show clear evidence of surface degradation. RDMIT appears to be an interesting approach to reduce ΔE* in RCs over time without negative effects on the translucency of the material.

40|$|The {{distribution}} and migration of liquids in various layers of a PEFC is commonly modelled by the 3 D flow equations. Given the fact these layers are very thin, {{there are major}} problems with such models, including heavy computational efforts and doubts in their applicability to the gas diffusion layer (GDL). Recently, a new approach for modelling multiphase flow through a stack of thin porous layers has been developed [Qin and Hassanizadeh, Int. J. Heat Mass Transfer 70 (2014) 693 - 708]. In this approach, which is called "reduced continua model", each layer is modelled as a 2 D domain with governing equations formulated in terms of thickness-averaged properties. The mass exchange between layers is prescribed by a new constitutive equation. The aim {{of this paper is}} to illustrate the implementation of the reduced continua model and show its advantages in <b>modelling</b> <b>liquid</b> water flooding in the GDL and micro porous layer (MPL) of a PEFC. We find that, in comparison to the Richards model, the reduced continua model predicts quite similar water dynamics in the MPL, but a lower steady-state water saturation in the GDL, particularly under the channel area. We provide a quantitative indication of the enormous computational efficiency of the reduced continua model as compared to the Richards model. Finally, the sensitivity studies of major material parameters of the reduced continua model have been provided...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFlash floods {{result from}} the {{combination}} of meteorological and hydrological conditions. Recognition of the coupled meteorological / hydrological nature of flash floods is now evident in interpretative studies and {{in the development of}} predictive models. There is a real need for research to improve the understanding of the major atmospheric and hydrologic factors leading to extreme flood events, especially those affecting small to medium ungauged basins. It has been shown that most of flash flood events can be attributed to stationary Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCSs). Due to their very localized nature, the observation of such event using a gauging network is problematic. Weather radars can provide better spatial rainfall estimations, even if radar assessment of rainfall can be significantly influenced by the orography itself. Therefore accurate monitoring of severe storm rainfall intensities remains a major challenge. In terms of the hydrological processes associated to flash flood, it is known that the knowledge of the soil characteristics is an important source of uncertainty in the understanding of the hydrological behavior of the catchments. This contribution presents a modelling approach aiming at quantifying the respective impact of rainfall estimation and soil variability on the simulated discharge for an extreme event in southern France. The method is illustrated for two ungauged medium size basins using different radar and gauge rainfall estimates and an existing soil data base. The hydrological distributed modelling approach was implemented within the numerical <b>modelling</b> <b>LIQUID</b> platform on the Cévennes-Vivarais region, used without any calibration phase, and validated with a regional approach using distributed post-flood estimation (Braud et al., EGU 2009). For the same event, previous work using an event-based TOPMODEL approach with a calibration phase, showed that the model efficiency significantly increases when the spatial variability of rainfall is taken into account. Nevertheless, for some of the catchments, the mis-performances remained unexplained. The model was run using different radar image treatments and the sensitivity on the hydrological response was assessed. The results show the important contribution of the volume-scanning protocol for the quantitative radar rainfall estimation at regional and local scale. Nevertheless, this study also highlights the importance of the description of the soil types to properly set up the hydrological model...|$|E
40|$|Significant {{progress}} has been made in recent years in <b>modelling</b> <b>liquid</b> crystal phases using the Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulation techniques. We describe the technique of molecular dynamics in the microcanonical ensemble that we have used in simulations of liquid crystal systems. A review and discussion of some of the important simulations that have been performed to date on non-spherical hard particle models, soft anisotropic single site models, and realistic atom-atom based models is presented. We report the results of molecular dynamics simulation studies of a system of particles interacting via an anisotropic potential proposed by Luckhurst and Romano, scaled by part of the well depth formulation employed by Gay and Berne. The resultant hybrid Gay-Berne Luckhurst-Romano (HGBLR) potential has an approximately spherical hard core with anisotropic long range attractive interactions with a dependency on the intermolecular vector joining a pair of sites. The spherical hard core nature of individual HGBLR centres notwithstanding we have parameterised single-site HGBLR centres to represent both calarnitic and discotic mesogens. Both systems are shown to exhibit a range of mesophases on cooling from the isotropic liquid to form a crystal, including uniaxial-nematic and columnar-like phases. Unlike previous hard particle studies these ordered phases obtain because of the presence of the long range attractive interactions. A comparison between the different structures formed with the two different parameterisations is presented including graphical representations of the simulation cell. In order to more closely represent the short range anisotropic interactions of real mesogens, a 3 -HGBLR-site model has been parameterised to represent the mesogen para -terphenyl. Details of the parameterisation are discussed. Two versions of this model,, a twisted central site 3 -HGBLR-site site model obtained from a molecular mechanics minimum energy conformation of para-terphenyl, and an all coplanar 3 -HGBLR-site site model have been studied using the molecular dynamics technique. The resultant models are found to be biaxial unlike previous anisotropic single site studies utilising soft potentials. Both models appear to exhibit a variety of uniaxial and biaxial mesophases but inclusion of the twisted site appears to promote the formation of biaxial phases. A comparison of the two models is made. </p...|$|E

The base-metal alloy Wirbond SG was veneered with the porcelain Vita Omega 900 and the metal-porcelain bond strength was tested with the crack-initiation-test according to SCHWICKERATH (210 specimens) and statistically analysed. Several specimens were examined with SEM and EDX-analysis. The following parameters were tested: -	temperature of oxide-firing -	reduced temperature of the opaque-dryingtime -	layering without any opaque-layer -	layering with merely on opaque-layer -	sintering of opaquer with increased firing temperatures -	use of glycering instead of <b>modelling</b> <b>liquid</b> for the opaquer -	layering of the opaquer with increased thickness -	firing of the body-porcelain with stepwise increased or decreased firing temperatures -	multiple firings of the body-porcelain In general, all measured bond-strength values surpass two third of the bond-strength values publicated in the relevant literature. The bond-strenhth values of all test-series exceeded the demanded minimum value of 25 MPa and can be regarded as clinically safe. The results can be summarized as follows: -	no increased bond-strenth could be achieved whith oxidation firings -	close attention has to be paid to the drying temperature of the opaque, the instructions of the manufacturer are decisive -	if nessecary, it is possible to abstain from the opaque or to sinter the porcelain with a single opaque-layer without a decrease of bond-strength -	layering the opauque with increased thickness has no negative effect on porcelain bond-strength -	use of glycerin as modelling fluid does not effect the porcelain bond-strength -	increased temperatures of the opaque-firing does not increase the porcelain bond-strength -	firing of the body-porcelain with increased or decreased temperatures does not effect the porcelain bond-strength substantially. Only if the body-porcelain is fired with temperatures of 100 °C above the manufactorer instructions, an significant increase of porcelain-bond-strength was measured -	this behavior of the porcelain Vita Omega 900 can be explained by its microstructure with controlled crystallisation of leucite without a temperature-dependent change of the tec-value -	multiple or corrective firings increase the porcelain bond-strength with a significance in the case of 3 corrective firings -	below the chromiumoxide layer on the metall-surface, an area with decreased chromium-concentration (tracer-zone) exeeds up to 2 - 2, 5 µm into the bulk metall...|$|E
40|$|An {{interesting}} way to design sustainable processes (which integrate simultaneously technical, {{economic and environmental}} constraints) entails a systematic approach combining process modelling, simulation, and process optimisation (Azapagic et al, 2011; Lam et al. 2011). The chemical and petroleum industries are quite familiar with the simulation-optimisation approach and widely use process simulators (Aspen Plus, ProsimPlus, Pro/II, COCO, etc.) to compute mass and energy balances. Conversely efficient and reliable food-specific tools for process modelling and simulation are missing compared to those developed for the chemical process industries. This is mainly {{due to a lack}} of both food process and thermodynamic models that account for the complexity of food materials (Trystram, 2012). Several attempts at <b>modelling</b> <b>liquid</b> food properties for process simulation have been achieved, either by the development of new unit operation mathematical models or assuming the additivity of the properties of food components. However none of the existing approaches satisfies the needs for food concentration processes simulation with process simulators (Madoumier et al., 2015). The objective of this work is then to propose a new modelling strategy for food products in order to be able to use the potential of a chemical process software tool for the modelling and simulation of food processes. The concentration process of milk by evaporation is selected to illustrate the methodology, since it was identified as one of the most energy intensive operations in the dairy industry. Aspen Plus is selected as the chemical process simulator to be adapted to food process modelling. The approach consists in defining the food product as a mixture of water and food-specific dry matter components (fat, proteins, carbohydrates, minerals, fibres), and integrating the properties of the food product (heat capacity, viscosity, etc.) as a function of process parameters (concentration and temperature in our case), in the process simulator. The food process is then modelled and simulated, and the results are compared with experimental data, so as to validate the food process model. This approach was validated with three existing processes at different scales: a pilot evaporator, a semi-industrial pilot evaporator, and an industrial four-effect evaporator. The implementation of a new overall heat transfer coefficient model integrated in the simulator was necessary. The results obtained by simulation were satisfying compared to experimental data in the case of both the industrial and semi-industrial processes (2 % error in required steam flow rate with the semiindustrial process). Through the example of milk concentration, the approach proposed for the modelling of food properties and concentration process is intended to serve as a generic method for food products modelling in classical process simulators...|$|E
40|$|Commercial liquid {{petroleum}} fuels {{are complex}} mixtures of various hydrocarbons. In multicomponent fuel modelling, these liquid fuels are represented typically with two components {{or up to}} ten discrete components. Even with ten components, there are limitations on the representation of real commercial fuels such as heavy fuel oil (HFO), which contains large numbers of hydrocarbons {{with a wide range}} of molecular weights and dissimilar structures. Continuous thermodynamics and pyrolysis chemical kinetics are used to model the behaviour of HFO in diesel spray combustion. The evaporation model is developed using the principle of continuous thermodynamics rather than discrete component modelling, to accurately cover the entire range of composition. Continuous thermodynamics reduces the computational simulation load compared to conventional discrete thermodynamics, without degrading the quality of prediction of the complex behaviours of such multicomponent fuels. In continuous thermodynamics <b>modelling,</b> <b>liquid</b> mixture compositions are simply represented by probability density functions (PDF). In the present study, HFO is represented by four fuel fractions: n-paraffins, aromatics, naphthenes and heavy residue. Each of these fractions is assigned a separate distribution function. In the evaporation model, both low-pressure and high-pressure formulations for the calculation of vapour-liquid equilibrium (VLE) at the droplet surface are provided. The formulations for high-pressure VLE are developed for a semicontinuous mixture and a generic approach to the equation of state (EOS) is used. Therefore, depending on the mixture compositions (continuous or semicontinuous) these formulations can be applied with any EOS. It is identified that in the high-pressure model, interaction coefficients between the liquid-liquid components and between the liquid component and air plays an important role during evaporation. Interaction coefficients help to improve the evaporation rate of heavy molecules. HFO is primarily composed of high molecular weight hydrocarbons which cannot evaporate but are pyrolised at high temperatures. Pyrolysis produces volatile gases and polymers through thermal cracking and polymerisation respectively. Baert’s pyrolysis model based on chemical kinetics for thermal cracking and polymerisation rate is developed. Results of this pyrolysis model show that polymer formation within a droplet is dependent on droplet heating rate and composition. Moreover, it is observed in Baert’s pyrolysis model results that the process of polymerisation starts prior to the thermal cracking. This order of thermal cracking and polymerisation is contradictory to the experimental evidence. Subsequently, Baert’s pyrolysis model parameters are modified. Results of the modified pyrolysis model did not show any significant dependency of polymer formation on droplet heating rate and in addition it showed thermal cracking beginning earlier than the polymerisation. The low and high-pressure evaporation models along with the modified pyrolysis model are applied to a single HFO droplet in a high pressure environment, showing good agreement with experimental results obtained by other researchers. A comparison of the low-pressure model with the high-pressure model for 100 micron and 30 micron droplets at high pressure and temperature show that evaporation of the volatile hydrocarbons (nparaffins, aromatics, naphthenes) from HFO occurs at a faster rate for the high-pressure model. However, this faster evaporation does not significantly affect the droplet lifetime because modelled HFO contains only 30...|$|E

Enzymes can be colocalized in multiprotein complexes, on scaffolds or inside subcellular organelles. Liquid organelles formed by intracellular phase coexistence could provide an additional means of sequential enzyme colocalization. Here we use experiment and computation to explore the kinetic consequences of sequential enzyme compartmentalization into <b>model</b> <b>liquid</b> organelles in a crowded polymer solution. Two proteins of the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, ASL (adenylosuccinate lyase, Step 8) and ATIC (5 -aminoimidazole- 4 -carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase/inosine monophosphate cyclohydrolase, Steps 9 and 10), were studied in a polyethylene glycol/dextran aqueous two-phase system.

The mathematical model was then used to explore additional, experimentally inaccessible conditions to predict when increased local concentrations of enzymes and substrates can (or cannot) be expected to yield increased rates of product formation. Our findings indicate that colocalization within these simplified <b>model</b> <b>liquid</b> organelles can lead to enhanced metabolic rates under some conditions, but that very strong partitioning into the phase that serves as the compartment is necessary.

40|$|In September 2002 a {{flash flood}} killed 23 human lives and {{generated}} 1. 2 billion Euros of damages {{in less than}} 24 hours over an area of 20 000 km 2 located {{in the south of}} France. The Gard river basin was hit by a storm that locally received more than 600 mm in one day. This storm triggered catastrophic flash floods on many upstream tributaries as well as the most important flood ever reported of the major rivers (Gard, Ceze and Vidourle). The distributed prediction of such extreme events remains an open question due to scarcity of observations and the unknown individual hydrological behaviour of very small basins. Due to the high spatial and temporal variability of rainfall and of the physiographic conditions, physically-based distributed hydrological models offer perspective for the simulation of such flash-floods at a regional scale, and more specifically in small ungauged basins which are recognized as the most vulnerable. However, the evaluation of model performance for such events remains largely open. Traditional stream gauge networks provide estimate at only a few locations, and these values are very uncertain for large discharges. Indeed, stage discharge relationship are in general extrapolated far beyond gauged values -if they are not destroyed- for extreme floods. Alternative sources of data are therefore necessary for model evaluation. In this paper, such an alternative solution is presented and illustrated using data from the Gard September 2002 event. It consists in using a post flood field survey data set made of estimation of maximum peak discharge and time of peak. Such estimations are conducted at the regional scales for catchments of various sizes (for a few to about 100 km 2) in areas affected by different rainfall amounts in order to sample a large range of hydrological responses. These estimations are derived from hydrological investigation using interviews of witnesses and river cross-sections surveys. The distributed modelling approach was implemented within the numerical <b>modelling</b> <b>LIQUID</b> platform on the Cévennes Vivarais region. The model is based on a spatial discretization in hydrolandscapes determined using the overlay of the sub-catchments map and the pedology map. Information taken from an existing soil data base about soil profiles structure and hydraulic properties deduced from pedo-transfer function were used to describe soil characteristics. The first version of the model, includes a representation of infiltration (Richards equation) on the hydro-landscapes, a calculation of the surface flux towards the nearest river reach and flow routing in the river network based on the kinematic wave approximation of the St-Venant equation. The model, forced using re-processed radar data at a 5 min and 1 km 2 resolution, was set up on 19 sub-catchments where post-flood maximum peak discharge estimation were available. Their size range from about 2 to 100 km 2. Model estimates of maximum peak discharge were found to be in fair agreement with post flood field estimates. The observed maximum specific discharge versus catchment area relationship was also correctly simulated. This first example shows the value of post-flood field survey, combined with high resolution radar rainfall for improving our prediction capacity of extreme floods events...|$|E

Berthier and G. Tarjus, Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 170601 (2009); U. R. Pedersen, T. B. Schroder and J. C. Dyre, Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 157801 (2010) ]. Recently, a more subtle structural quantity, the so-called "point-to-set" length, was found to reliably correlate with the average dynamics [G. M. Hocky, T. E. Markland and D. R. Reichman, Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 225506 (2012) ]. Here we use computer simulations to examine the behavior of fluctuations around the average dynamics, i. e., dynamic heterogeneity. We study five model glass-forming liquids: three <b>model</b> <b>liquids</b> used in previous works and two additional <b>model</b> <b>liquids</b> with finite range interactions. Some of these systems have very similar local structure but vastly different dynamics. We show that for all these systems the spatial extent and the anisotropy of dynamic heterogeneity correlate very well with the average dynamics...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe use {{molecular}} dynamics simulation to describe a method {{that can be used}} to <b>model</b> <b>liquid</b> drop evaporation. For application, the liquid is taken to be water. Using the properties of the liquid and a Lennard-Jones potential, we derive dynamical equations, which are used to describe the gross dynamical behavior of the liquid-vapor molecular system. The resulting dynamical equations are solved numerically by a time stepping, numerical method. The evaporation of the liquid to the vapor phase is described...|$|R

Nanostructure ferrite thin films were prepared using the extraction-pyrolytic technique.

The first method deals with <b>modeling</b> <b>liquids</b> for computer animation and is based on the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations on coarse grids using finite differences. The second method models the motion of the heart from MRI data based on finite element theory. The method is capable of analyzing the heart’s motion in a clinically useful way. 1...|$|R
