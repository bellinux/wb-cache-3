5|$|In {{the wake}} of the floods, several citizens' groups and {{political}} parties, notably the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), strongly recommended that Tiruchirappalli be designated as the second, administrative capital of Tamil Nadu, due to its centralised location, the presence of a large international airport, a low level of congestion, the availability of vacant government land and a decreased likelihood of flooding. PMK leader S. Ramadoss said the party would seriously consider the <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> came to power.|$|E

The committee commented that in similar circumstances it had shown leniency to others doing the same thing, and would not have attached great importance to the <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had stood alone.|$|E

500|$|This grebe lays a clutch, and {{sometimes}} two clutches, {{of three to}} four chalky greenish or bluish eggs. Nests that have been parasitized, however, will have two more eggs on average, even though the amount that the host lays {{is about the same}} no <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> has been parasitized or not. The eggs, although they are initially immaculate, do get stained by the plant matter that the nest is built out of. The eggs measure [...] on average and are incubated by both parents for about 21 days. The laying date of the eggs is somewhat synchronized, with birds in small colonies having the laying dates spread out by just a few days, compared to large colonies, where the laying date is spread out over more than 10 days.|$|E
500|$|Five {{years after}} the release of Ænima, Tool {{announced}} a new album, Systema Encéphale, with a 12-song track list in January 2001. A month later, the band revealed that the new album was actually titled Lateralus and that the previous announcement had been a ruse. The album was released in May 2001 to positive reviews. Known for his [...] "dark, intelligent, compelling, and unexpected lyrical twists", Keenan was acclaimed for his songwriting on the album, in which he [...] "doesn't cross the line from darkness to ugliness ... as often as he has in the past". In an interview with [...] NY Rock, Keenan explained, [...] "Everything we release with Tool is inspired by our music. It doesn't <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> is a video or if its lyrics. The lyrics for [...] "Schism" [...] are nothing more than my interpretation of the music." [...] The album became a worldwide success, reaching No. 1 on the U.S. Billboard 200 albums chart in its debut week, and Tool received their second Grammy Award for the best metal performance of 2001 for [...] "Schism". In 2002, Keenan recorded a song called [...] "Fallen" [...] with Thirty Seconds to Mars that was released on the band's self-titled debut album.|$|E

2500|$|Philosopher and {{physicist}} Mario Bunge {{has written}} that [...] "psychokinesis, or PK, violates the principle that mind cannot act directly on <b>matter.</b> (<b>If</b> <b>it</b> did, no experimenter could trust his readings of measuring instruments.)

The claim that quantum mechanics allows {{for the possibility of}} mental power influencing randomizers — an alleged case of micro-PK — is ludicrous since that theory respects the said conservation principles, and it deals exclusively with physical things." ...|$|E
2500|$|From the {{premises}} outlined so far, there arises only a force which {{is proportional to}} the surface of the bodies. But gravity {{is proportional to the}} masses. To satisfy the need for mass proportionality, the theory posits that a) the basic elements of matter are very small so that gross matter consists mostly of empty space, and b) that the particles are so small, that only a small fraction of them would be intercepted by gross matter. The result is, that the [...] "shadow" [...] of each body is proportional to the surface of every single element of <b>matter.</b> <b>If</b> <b>it</b> is then assumed that the elementary opaque elements of all matter are identical (i.e., having the same ratio of density to area), it will follow that the shadow effect is, at least approximately, proportional to the mass (P5).|$|E
2500|$|As {{will be seen}} in the {{following}} discussion, the propulsion system is designed to produce maximum traction motor torque at start-up, which explains why modern locomotives are capable of starting trains weighing in excess of 15,000 tons, even on ascending grades. [...] Current technology allows a locomotive to develop as much as 30 percent of its loaded driver weight in tractive force, amounting to some [...] of drawbar pull for a large, six-axle freight (goods) unit. [...] In fact, a consist of such units can produce more than enough drawbar pull at start-up to damage or derail cars (if on a curve) or break couplers (the latter being referred to in North American railroad slang as [...] "jerking a lung"). Therefore, it is incumbent upon the engine driver to carefully monitor the amount of power being applied at start-up to avoid damage. In particular, [...] "jerking a lung" [...] could be a calamitous <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> were to occur on an ascending grade, except that the safety inherent in the correct operation of automatic train brakes installed in wagons today, prevents runaway trains by automatically applying the wagon brakes when train line air pressure drops.|$|E

50|$|As she put it, {{she drove}} three autos {{in the world}} of languages, namely autolexia, autographia and autologia. (Out of the {{elements}} of these words, coming from Greek, auto- means self, and &#8209;lexia, &#8209;graphia and &#8209;logia refers to reading, writing and speaking respectively.) Autolexia means reading for myself: the book I discover by myself, which provides novelties again and again, which I can take with me anywhere, which won't get tired of being asked questions. Autographia means writing for myself, when I try to write about my thoughts, experiences, everyday things in the very language I'm just learning, no <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> <b>it's</b> silly, no <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> <b>it's</b> incorrect, no <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> a word or two is left out.

2500|$|Historically {{women have}} been {{attended}} and supported by other women during labour and birth. However currently, as more women are giving birth in a hospital rather than at home, continuous support has become {{the exception rather than}} the norm. When women became pregnant any time before the 1950s the husband would not be in the birthing room. It did not <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was a home birth; the husband was waiting downstairs or in another room in the home. If it was in a hospital then the husband was in the waiting room. [...] "Her husband was attentive and kind, but, Kirby concluded, Every good woman needs a companion of her own sex." [...] Obstetric care frequently subjects women to institutional routines, which may have adverse effects on the progress of labour. Supportive care during labour may involve emotional support, comfort measures, and information and advocacy which may promote the physical process of [...] labour as well as women's feelings of control and competence, thus reducing the need for obstetric intervention. The continuous support may be provided either by hospital staff such as nurses or midwives, doulas, or by companions of the woman's choice from her social network. [...] There is increasing evidence to show that the participation of the child's father in the birth leads to better birth and also post-birth outcomes, providing the father does not exhibit excessive anxiety.|$|E
