40|$|Foot {{and mouth}} disease (FMD) {{has been one}} of the most {{important}} epizootic diseases in several cloven-hoofed animals including buffaloes, causing severe economic losses in Vietnam. This study aimed at observing clinical indicators, physiological parameters, haematological and blood chemistry values of 30 buffaloes naturally infected with FMD virus (FMDV). The study was undertaken from January 2015 to February 2016 in Hanoi, Vietnam. Results show that buffaloes infected with FMDV displayed significantly higher fever, increased respiratory rate and increased heart frequency compared to healthy animals. Moreover, FMDV-infected animals always showed high fever and vesicular stomatitis, often showed edging nail congestive inflammation and, sometimes only, blisters on the nipple. Haematological indicators showed that FMDV-infected buffaloes were dehydrated (increased total protein). Besides, infected animals also underwent anaemia as <b>mean</b> <b>corpuscular</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> and <b>mean</b> <b>corpuscular</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>concentrations</b> were plummeted. Total white blood cell count plummeted too, especially the number and proportion of neutrophils. Meanwhile, the number and proportion of lymphocytes sharply increased compared to healthy animals.

40|$|The iron status, dietary intake, {{and protein}} energy {{nutritional}} status of healthy Asian children {{ranging in age}} from 4 to 40 months was investigated. The serum ferritin, erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin, <b>haemoglobin</b> and <b>mean</b> <b>corpuscular</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>concentrations,</b> and <b>mean</b> <b>corpuscular</b> volume were determined in a community study of 138 children.

The mean values for these four indices were significantly lower in toddlers between 21 and 23 months age than in infants less than 6 months old.

40|$|Molecular {{mechanisms}} {{that may explain}} why oxygen affinity is higher in foetal than in maternal red blood cells were studied in the viviparous garter snake, Thamnophis elegans (Baird and Girard).

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) lowered the oxygen affinity of the haemoglobins from about 3 - 6 to 9 - 6 mmHg (lmmHg = 133 - 3 Pa) at pH 6 - 8.

The Result of this research showed that there was significant correlation of dependent variable benzene from OVM with haematology profile for independent variable for Haemoglobin (p= 0, 000), Red Blood Cell (and p= 0, 014) and <b>Mean</b> <b>Corpuscular</b> <b>Haemoglobin</b> (p= 0, 002), and there is no significant correlation for all confounding variable : Body Mass Index, smoking habit and working years. Result of analysis of logistics regression indicate that benzene rate of OVM (> 0, 5 ppm) have potential effect on Haemoglobin (p= 0, 000; OR= 11, 510), Red Blood Cell (p= 0, 008; OR= 5, 245) and <b>Mean</b> <b>Corpuscular</b> <b>Haemoglobin</b> (p= 0, 001; OR= 0, 133). From this research can be concluded, that benzene exposure > 0. 5 ppm, representing the risk factors to haematology profile (rate of Haemoglobin, rate of Red Blood Cell and rate of <b>Mean</b> <b>Corpuscular</b> <b>Haemoglobin).</b> So that medical surveillance conducted continously every year is necessary to minimize and prevent the effect of low level benzene exposure.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} effectiveness of ethanolic extract of Tinospora cordifolia root extract in alleviating the toxicity of aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) in male swiss albino mice. Forty eight male swiss albino mice (305 g) were exposed to aflatoxin B 1 (2 g 30 /g body weight, orally) either individually or in combination with Tinospora cordifolia (50, 100, 200 mg kg - 1, orally) once daily for 25 days. Evaluation was made for haemato-serological parameters. The results suggested that aflatoxin B 1 exposure led to significant fall (p< 0. 01) in haemoglobin, erythrocyte count and significant rise (p< 0. 01) in platelet count, total leukocyte count, segmented neutrophil, lymphocyte count (p< 0. 05), serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, Serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase and alkaline phosphatase whereas no significant difference was seen in haematocrit, <b>mean</b> <b>corpuscular</b> volume, <b>mean</b> <b>corpuscular</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> and <b>mean</b> <b>corpuscular</b> <b>haemoglobin</b> content. Treatment with plant extract alone had no negative effects on most of the parameters. Concomitant administration of all three plant doses along with aflatoxin significantly diminished the adverse effect of aflatoxin and altered most of the haematological and serological variables...|$|R
