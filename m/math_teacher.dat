Rothstein held that American <b>math</b> <b>teachers</b> tend to be better trained because they have more resources available like the extremely large $1 billion cash grant from the National Science Foundation for math and science instruction in high school which English teachers cannot reap.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (l. 58 - 59). The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the relationship between 71 h 81 h and 91 h grade Lebanese students' attitudes toward mathematics as a subject matter and their attitudes toward their <b>math</b> <b>teachers.</b> Another purpose was to investigate teachers' perceptions of their students' attitudes toward math as a subject and toward their <b>math</b> <b>teachers.</b> The three instruments used are questionnaires distributed to students, interviews conducted with teachers and observations of classroom climate. The results showed that there is a strong and significant positive correlation between students' attitudes toward math as a subject and students' attitudes toward their <b>math</b> <b>teachers.</b> The study also revealed that there are no significant gender differences in either the students' attitudes toward math as a subject or toward their <b>math</b> <b>teachers.</b> Moreover, interviews with teachers showed that they perceived their students as having generally positive attitudes toward math as a subject and toward them as <b>math</b> <b>teachers.</b> Larger samples that include participants from all grade levels and from diverse schools are needed for generalizing the results on the national level. 1 bound copy: 104 leaves; 30 cm. available at RNL...|$|R

The conventional approaches to <b>Math</b> <b>teachers</b> selection problem tend to be less effective in dealing with the imprecise or vague nature of the linguistic assessment. Under many situations, the values of the qualitative criteria are often imprecisely defined for the decision-makers. To overcome this difficulty, fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making methods are proposed. In this paper, we present a multi-criteria decision making approach for selecting <b>Math</b> <b>teachers</b> under partial or incomplete information (uncertainty). The proposed approach comprises of two steps. In step 1, we identify the criteria for <b>Math</b> <b>teachers</b> selection. In step 2, experts provide linguistic ratings to the potential alternatives against the selected criteria. Fuzzy TOPSIS is used to generate aggregate scores selection of best alternative.

25|$|West's {{father died}} {{around the time}} of his birth in Washington, D.C. His mother was hospitalized with {{tuberculosis}} in 1882 and young Jimmie was placed in the Washington City Orphan Home; his mother died later that year. In 1883, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and by 1885 he was crippled, with one leg shorter than the other. At the orphanage, Jimmie was put to work with the girls, sewing and caning chairs. He became a voracious reader and took charge of the orphanage library. After convincing the staff that he could continue his chores (stoking the furnace and caring for chickens) he entered public school at the fifth grade. In 1895, he graduated with honors from Business High School, where he had edited the school newspaper, was business manager of the football team and had acted as a substitute <b>math</b> <b>teacher.</b>|$|E

Apatow fought with the network to include Freaks and Geeks actors, but the network only picked up Seth Rogen (who was already committed to the show as a writer) as a regular cast member. However, Jason Segel became a recurring character, and Samm Levine, Busy Philipps, and Natasha Melnick guest-starred in multi-episode arcs, as did prominent Freaks and Geeks guest stars Steve Bannos (who played McKinley High <b>math</b> <b>teacher</b> Mr. Frank Kowchevski) and David Krumholtz (who played Neal's older brother, Barry Schweiber). Martin Starr was prominent in another episode, and a scene with Sarah Hagan was shot, although it was cut for television broadcast. The show was also canceled during its first season.|$|E
25|$|C.J. Barnes, {{portrayed by}} David Spade (2004–2005), is Cate's nephew. He was {{once in the}} Army and claims to have studied aerial {{photography}} during the Gulf War, and to have received a Purple Heart in combat, which is in complete contrast with his generally childish attitude. He is {{a teacher at the}} school and often pursues women, albeit unsuccessfully. When C.J. first arrives, the family is initially surprised. He reveals to them that he was ashamed that he did not live up to be the person Paul had once said he would be and avoided them because of that. He lives along with his grandfather, Jim, in the basement (having previously lived in a van, which was burned by that same grandfather). He once dated Mrs. Krupp, his cousins' (Kerry and Bridget) <b>math</b> <b>teacher,</b> but he ended up cheating on her with his ex-girlfriend Cheryl. He once revealed that his first initial stands for Corey, but Rory said that was untrue. C.J. previously smoked marijuana heavily (and in fact used to smoke with Kyle's older brother), but at the start of his appearances, he claims not to have touched it in two years (he originally claimed it was five, though he relented after Jim expressed disbelief).|$|E
25|$|Kyo is {{the heir}} to the Tengu Clan. It is {{revealed}} that Kyo is not human but a powerful demon. When he is in his demon form, his hair grown longer, has black wings, and wears a mask that looks like a crow's beak. Perverted and cocky to many, but he treats Misao with a combination of kindness and coldness depending on his mood. Kyo met Misao during their childhood; they quickly developed a strong bond and {{he fell in love with}} her. They also made a promise that she would be his bride, which he is determined to fulfill. His older brother, Sho, was supposed to be clan leader, but Kyo surpassed him for Misao's sake (as only a clan leader may seek her as their bride). In order to stay close to Misao, he moved back to his house next door to hers and took a job as a <b>math</b> <b>teacher</b> at her school. He is always protecting her and healing her wounds, also finding moments to steal a kiss. While he cares deeply for Misao, Kyo has deep attachments to those close to him: such that he took Taro under his wings to train him and make him stronger after Taro was abused by Shou. Kyo has deep disdain towards his brother (for his abusive ways) and his father (whom he suspected of murdering his mother). After Sho's death, Kyo learns that Misao is pregnant with his child, a powerful demon child. He is initially happy of the news, but when he learns that the children of the Immortal Fruit will feed on their mothers after childbirth, he wants her to abort the pregnancy but she refuses. When Misao tells him that she loves the baby and it loves her, he comes to care for the baby. Misao gives birth to a boy, whom they name Sou. Misao, by miracle, survives and Kyo is able to live happily with her and Sou.|$|E
