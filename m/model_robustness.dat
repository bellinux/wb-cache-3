40|$|An {{efficient}} model identification algorithm {{for a large}} {{class of}} linear-in-the-parameters models is introduced that simultaneously optimises the model approximation ability, sparsity and robustness. The derived model parameters in each forward regression step are initially estimated via the orthogonal least squares (OLS), followed by being tuned with a new gradient-descent learning algorithm based on the basis pursuit that minimises the l(1) norm of the parameter estimate vector. The model subset selection cost function includes a D-optimality design criterion that maximises the determinant of the design matrix of the subset to ensure <b>model</b> <b>robustness</b> and to enable the model selection procedure to automatically terminate at a sparse model. The proposed approach {{is based on the}} forward OLS algorithm using the modified Gram-Schmidt procedure. Both the parameter tuning procedure, based on basis pursuit, and the model selection criterion, based on the D-optimality that is effective in ensuring <b>model</b> <b>robustness,</b> are integrated with the forward regression. As a consequence the inherent computational efficiency associated with the conventional forward OLS approach is maintained in the proposed algorithm.

40|$|ABSTRACT Planktonic models {{represent}} {{a powerful tool}} for creating hypotheses and making predictions about the functioning of marine ecosystems. Their complexity varies according to the number of state variables and the choice of functional forms. We evaluated plankton models during the last 15 years (n = 145) with the aims of understanding why they differ in complexity, evaluating <b>model</b> <b>robustness,</b> and describing studies of plankton modelling around the globe. We classified models into four groups: Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton (NPZ), Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton-Detritus (NPZD), Size-Structured (SS) and Plankton-Functional-Type (PFT). Our results revealed that the number of state variables varied according to the question being addressed: NPZ models were more frequently applied in physical-biological studies, while PFT models were more applied for investigating biogeochemical cycles. Most models were based on simple functional forms which neglect important feedback related to control of plankton dynamics. Modelling studies sometimes failed to describe sensitivity analysis, calibration and validation. The importance of testing different functional forms was commonly overlooked, and the lack of empirical data affected the verification of <b>model</b> <b>robustness.</b> Lastly, we highlight the need to develop modelling studies in the Southern Hemisphere, including Brazil, in order to provide predictions that assist the management of marine ecosystems...|$|E
