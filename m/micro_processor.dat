5000|$|Isometric {{exercise}} tools perform exercises or {{strength test}} using static contraction of a muscle without any visible {{movement in the}} angle of the joint. This is reflected in the name; the term [...] "isometric" [...] combines the prefix [...] "iso" [...] (same) with [...] "metric" [...] (distance), meaning that in these exercises the length of the muscle does not change, [...] as compared to isotonic contractions ("tonos" [...] means [...] "tension" [...] in Greek) in which the contraction strength does not change but the joint angle does.

Upgrades to the Stinger-RMP missile corrected known operational deficiencies, which were discovered during {{testing in the}} late 1980s.

Despite these deficiencies, the Army approximated that Mujahedeen forces in Afghanistan achieved a success rate of 79 percent against Soviet aircraft with the Stinger-POST from 1986 through 1988. Unfortunately, the Stinger-RMP missile test program was suspended during Operation Desert Storm, and the missile was rushed into the field in preparation for the Gulf War. After the war, the Army proposed a two-phased upgrade program, Stinger-RMP Block I and Stinger-RMP Block II.|$|E

40|$|Energy usage is an {{increasingly}} limiting factor for modern <b>micro</b> <b>processors.</b> One of these limitations {{is that it}} is no longer possible to power up all the transistors of the processor at the same time. The Single-ISA Heterogeneous MAny-core Computer (SHMAC) project considers how a heterogeneous multi core architecture can be used to reduce these limitations. A heterogeneous multi core architecture can consist of a selection of different cores, where each of these cores can be better suited for a specific task. Some of these cores can be, or contain, accelerators; hardware designed to perform very specific tasks efficiently. This thesis covers the implementation of a Cellular Automata (CA) accelerator, which can be configured to evolve time steps for 1 D or 2 D CA. A functional implementation integrated into SHMAC is presented and demonstrated by a few example applications, including pseudorandom number generation in a 1 D CA, and Conway's Game of Life in a 2 D CA.
