40|$|International audiencePrevious work using single-cell {{recordings}} in {{monkeys and}} neuro-imaging studies in humans {{has shown that}} perceiving an object or imaging the action associated with the object recruits the same brain regions in the ventral premotor cortex as performing an action with the object. We used {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) for examining whether similar brain regions are also activated while maintaining information about manipulable objects in working memory. Holding information about manipulable objects in working memory activated the left ventral premotor cortex and the left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area). Conversely, non-manipulable objects to be held in working memory co-activated Broca's area and the left angular gyrus. When contrasted directly, manipulable relative to non-manipulable objects activated the left ventral premotor cortex and the anterior intraparietal sulcus, a circuitry that is assumed to mediate the transformation of movement-relevant object properties into hand actions. These results indicate that visual working memory for manipulable objects is based on <b>motor</b> <b>programmes</b> associated with their use.

40|$|Fast {{extensor}} tibiae (FETi) {{activity has}} been implicated {{as a crucial}} element underlying the locust kick <b>motor</b> <b>programme</b> with regard to four circuits, (i) A positive feedback reflex from extensor tibiae (ETi) muscle tension helps maintain FETi spiking during co-contraction, (ii) A central connection from FETi to flexor tibiae (FITi) motor neurones helps initiate FITi spiking {{at the start of}} co-contraction, (iii) Reflex feedback from ETi tension to FITi motor neurones helps maintain the latter spiking during co-contraction after the central connection has decremented, (iv) A proprioceptive gate controlled by ETi tension ensures that FITi trigger activity does not occur until sufficient ETi tension has developed to allow an effective kick. The hypotheses concerning these circuits have been tested in two ways. First, FETi was phasically inhibited for varying periods during co-contraction, abolish-ing its spikes and hence its central output, and reducing ETi tension. Second, the nerve containing the FETi axon was cut in the femur, thus partially denervating the ETi muscle, and reducing its tension without directly affecting FETi activity. In both cases, kicks were analysed to see whether the <b>motor</b> <b>programme</b> changed in accordance with the circuit model. The overall conclusion is that the model is not correct, since considerable experimentally induced changes in FETi activity and ETi tension had no obvious effects on the <b>motor</b> <b>programme.</b> The circuits may play a supplementary role in generating the programme, but they are not crucial to it...|$|E
40|$|We {{review a}} series of {{behavioural}} experiments on imitation in children and adults that test the predictions of a new theory of imitation. Most of the recent theories of imitation assume a direct visual-to-motor mapping between perceived and imitated movements. Based on our findings of systematic errors in imitation, the new theory of goal-directed imitation (GOADI) instead assumes that imitation is guided by cognitively specified goals. According to GOADI, the imitator does not imitate the observed movement as a whole, but rather decomposes it into its separate aspects. These aspects are hierarchically ordered, and the highest aspect becomes the imitator's main goal. Other aspects become sub-goals. In accordance with the ideomotor principle, the main goal activates the <b>motor</b> <b>programme</b> that is most strongly associated with the achievement of that goal. When executed, this <b>motor</b> <b>programme</b> sometimes matches, and sometimes does not, the model's movement. However, the main goal extracted from the model movement is almost always imitated correctly...|$|E
40|$|Perceptual Motor Programmes are {{implemented}} {{in more than}} 300 junior schools around New Zealand (Cropp, 2008). When implemented, many teachers believe the programme improves learning including reading abilities, increases physical activity, and enhances social skills (Broadley & Litterick-Biggs, 2005). Despite continued use of the programme {{there is very little}} research to support claims of improved academic readiness, and as a result concerns are raised around the use of a non-validated approach to improve children’s literacy learning and learning in general. This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a Perceptual <b>Motor</b> <b>Programme</b> on the reading abilities of year one and two children. Participants were 37 year one and two children, aged 5 - 6 years, from two classes at a low-decile primary school. Children were tested three times over ten weeks of the study using running records and sight word testing as well as non-word reading. One class acted as the control group and did not receive the programme. Repeated measures ANOVAs revealed a significant time effect over the three time plots for both groups. This time effect is consistent with what you could expect in education where children generally improve over time. However using scores from pre, mid and post testing in all tests, the overall {{difference between the two groups}} was non-significant. This result alone clearly disproves the claims of improved reading abilities through the implementation of Smart Starts perceptual <b>motor</b> <b>programme.</b> Sight word testing showed only a marginal time effect due to the scores being high at pre testing creating a ceiling effect where maximum scores had already occurred leaving little room for improvement over time. When asked to observe one child, teacher observations suggested improved attitudes towards learning and some risk-taking occurring later in the study. This was the case for both children observed, therefore cannot be attributed to the participation of the perceptual <b>motor</b> <b>programme</b> but rather part of the developmental process and current teaching and learning programmes. The results of this study have implications for the implementation of non-validated interventions in schools. This study outlines the importance of educators using evidence-based practice and research. It explores the purpose, benefits and need for the Smart Starts perceptual <b>motor</b> <b>programme.</b> The use of non-validated approaches take time, money, resources, staffing and energy away from proven practices that improve children’s reading abilities...|$|E

40|$|Activity {{patterns}} of six morphologically similar, homologous muscles were recorded {{from the fourth}} leg pair in two species of arachnids that use different mechanisms to extend the femur-patella (knee) joint during locomotion. The giant whipscorpion Mastigoproctus giganteus (Uropygi) lacks femur-patella extensor muscles but extends this joint with hydraulic pressure, a mechanism {{that appears to be}} phylogenetically primitive in arachnids. The black emperor scorpion Pandinus imperator (Scorpiones) has an unusual muscle that promotes simul-taneous extension at the femur-patella joint and distally adjacent patella-tibia joint. Comparison of electromyograms from freely walking animals revealed similarities in muscle firing {{patterns of}} the two species, including asymmetrical alternation of trochanter-femur levator and depressor muscles, transfemoral muscle activation during protraction and abrupt termination just prior to levator activation, and persistence of flexor activity during retraction (extension). These results indicate that the apparent evolutionary transition from hydraulic to muscular extension occurred without substantial alteration of several com-ponents of the primitive <b>motor</b> <b>programme.</b> It is suggested that the patterns of extension force generated by hydraulic pressure and by bifunctional extensors are similar and that this similarity is associated with conservation of the <b>motor</b> <b>programme...</b>|$|E

The patients were studied when immobile after 12 - 18 hours withdrawal from antiparkinsonian drug therapy (OFF) and when more mobile after drugs (ON). Subjects performed each movement separately (simple movements) and both movements either simultaneously or sequentially (complex movements). The duration of both movements and the time between the onset of each movement in the sequential task (interonset latency) were measured. The patients OFF therapy had longer movement times than normal for both movements; these improved after levodopa but still were not normal. When the patients performed complex movements there was an extra slowness, over and above that seen for simple movements, in both movements of the simultaneous task {{and in the second}} movement of the sequential task. In addition, the interonset latency in the sequential task was longer than normal. After levodopa there was a more striking improvement in the movement times of complex movements than there had been for simple movements. The interonset latency in the sequential task was shorter than before therapy though still was not the same as in normal subjects.

40|$|Tourette's {{syndrome}} is a chronic neurological disorder manifested by involuntary motor tics and vocalisations. Because the basal ganglia have {{been implicated in}} the pathology underlying Tourette's syndrome, the present two procedures, both involving sequential movements, sought {{to determine the extent}} to which patients with Tourette's syndrome were reliant on, and could utilise different levels of advance information. Patients with Tourette's syndrome were found to be more reliant than controls on external visual cues to execute rather than to initiate a <b>motor</b> <b>programme.</b> When there was a high level of reduction in advance information [...] that is, a visual pathway to be followed was extinguished well in advance of each successive movement [...] executions progressively slowed as the sequence was traversed. Similarly, if no advance information was provided before each move, movement execution was slower than that of controls. The movement initiation times of patients with Tourette's syndrome were, however, similar to those of controls, as were their movement execution times when advance visual information was available. It seems that patients with Tourette's syndrome, like parkinsonian patients who are known to have a basal ganglia disorder, require external sensory cues to sequence a <b>motor</b> <b>programme</b> effectively. The present study found evidence consistent with the hypothesis that patients with Tourette's syndrome, like patients with Parkinson's disease, may be dysfunctional in internal switching mechanisms. Alternatively, with limited visual guidance, patients with Tourette's syndrome, regardless of medication or depression state, may require more time to plan and programme each next submovement, and under such conditions may require external visual cues to direct attention effectively to given targets. Although the underlying pathogenesis is still speculative, it is concluded that there is much to support the notion that Tourette's syndrome may stem from abnormalities of the major pathways between the basal ganglia and the frontal lobes...|$|E

40|$|Movement {{execution}} is {{speeded up}} when a startle auditory stimulus is applied with an imperative signal {{in a simple}} reaction time task experiment, a phenomenon described as StartReact. The effect has been recently observed in a step adjustment task requiring fast selection of specific movements in a choice reaction time task. Therefore, we hypothesized that inducing a StartReact effect may be beneficial in obstacle avoidance under time pressure, when subjects have to perform fast gait adjustments. Twelve healthy young adults walked on a treadmill and obstacles were released in specific moments of the step cycle. On average the EMG onset latency in the biceps femoris shortened by 20 % while amplitude increased by 50 %, in trials in which an auditory startle accompanied obstacle avoidance. The presentation of a startle increased the probability of using a long step strategy, enlarged stride length modifications and resulted in higher success rates, to avoid the obstacle. We also {{examined the effects of}} the startle in a condition in which the obstacle was not present in comparison to a condition in which the obstacle was visibly present but it did not fall. In the latter condition, the obstacle avoidance reaction occurred with a similar latency but smaller amplitude as in trials in which the obstacle was actually released. Our results suggest that the <b>motor</b> <b>programmes</b> used for obstacle avoidance are probably stored at subcortical structures.

40|$|Flexion and {{extension}} movements are organized reciprocally, so that extensor motoneurones in {{the spinal cord}} are inhibited when flexor muscles are active and vice versa. During and just prior to dorsiflexion of the ankle, soleus motoneurones are thus inhibited as evidenced by a depression of the soleus H-reflex. It is therefore surprising that soleus motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have been found not to be reduced and even facilitated during a voluntary dorsiflexion. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate if MEPs, evoked by TMS, show a similar facilitation prior to and at the onset of contraction of muscles that are antagonists to the muscle in which the MEP is evoked and if so, examine the origin of such a facilitatory <b>motor</b> <b>programme.</b> Eleven seated subjects reacted to an auditory cue by contracting either the tibialis anterior (TA) or soleus muscle of the left ankle. TMS was applied to the hotspot of TA and soleus muscles on separate days. Stimuli were delivered prior to and at the beginning of contraction. Soleus MEPs were significantly facilitated when TMS was applied 50 ms prior to onset of plantar flexion. Surprisingly, soleus MEPs were also facilitated (although to a lesser extent) at a similar time in relation to the onset of dorsiflexion. TA MEPs were facilitated 50 ms prior to onset of dorsiflexion and neither depressed nor facilitated prior to plantar flexion. No difference was found between the facilitation of the soleus MEP and motor evoked responses to cervicomedullary stimulation prior to dorsiflexion, suggesting that the increased soleus MEPs were not caused by changes at a cortical level. This was confirmed by the observation that short-latency facilitation of the soleus H-reflex by subthreshold TMS was increased prior to plantar flexion, but not prior to dorsiflexion. These findings suggest that voluntary contraction at the ankle is accompanied by preceding facilitation of antagonists by a subcortical <b>motor</b> <b>programme.</b> This may help to ensure that the direction of movement may be changed quickly and efficiently during functional motor tasks...|$|E

On the other hand, copying gestures was not impaired relative to naming gestures, indicating that an ideomotor deficit in action execution, per se, was unlikely to explain the impairments in object use. We suggest instead that the patients had an impairment in stored motor programmes for action, over and above their deficits in semantic knowledge.
