40|$|This study {{examined}} the issue of right turn crashes at Adelaide signalised intersections through a literature review, an analysis of relevant South Australian fatal crashes, an examination of Adelaide <b>metropolitan</b> <b>crashes</b> reported {{to the police and}} some in-depth crash investigation. Such crashes were found to be relatively common and to be associated with both older and younger right turning drivers. Full control of right turn movements at all times of the day appears to be the most effective treatment. Dedicated right turn lanes and the use of red light and speed cameras may also offer some safety benefits. C. N. Kloeden, S. L. Versteegh, V. L. Lindsay, A. J. McLea...|$|R
40|$|Young drivers aged 16 to 24 {{years are}} {{over-represented}} in crashes worldwide. A {{better understanding of}} young driver behaviour and the circumstances leading to crash involvement might assist in reducing young driver road trauma. The Centre for Automotive Safety Research (CASR) has conducted three in-depth studies investigating rural and <b>metropolitan</b> <b>crashes</b> in South Australia over the last decade. In-depth investigation of crashes provides detailed information on crashes that otherwise {{could not be obtained}} from aggregate police-reported crash data. This paper uses the comprehensive information collected from in-depth crash investigation to examine the causes and contributing factors leading to young driver crashes. Analyses by age group (16 - 19 years, 20 - 24 years) and level of experience (P-plates< 1 year, P-plates≥ 1 year) were undertaken to determine whether the incidence of specific driver errors varied over {{the first few years of}} driving and could account for the substantial decline in crashes during that time. Detailed information for 256 drivers aged between 16 and 24 years was examined to identify behaviours contributing to young driver crash involvement. Based on the findings from the analysis, measures that might reduce the number of young driver crashes and moderate the injury severity of such crashes are discussed with reference to Safe System principles.

40|$|Despite {{improvements}} in road safety, young drivers {{continue to be}} over-represented in crashes. CASR has conducted three indepth studies investigating rural and <b>metropolitan</b> <b>crashes</b> in South Australia over the last decade. In-depth investigation of crashes provides very detailed information on crashes that otherwise {{could not be obtained}} from aggregate police-reported crash data. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the specific factors that lead to young driver crash involvement, this study used the comprehensive information collected from in-depth crash investigation to examine the causes and contributing factors leading to young driver crashes. Analyses by age group and level of experience were undertaken to determine whether the incidence of specific driver errors varied over the first few years of driving and could account for the substantial decline in crashes during that time. The study also examined specific driver errors and contributing factors associated with young driver risk-taking behaviour and with those who made simple mistakes or errors that lead to crash involvement. Detailed information for 256 drivers aged between 16 and 24 years was examined to identify behaviours contributing to young driver crash involvement. Based on findings from the analysis, measures that might reduce the incidence and severity of young driver crashes are discussed within a Safe System framework. LN Wundersit...|$|R
2500|$|On January 28, 1966 at 17:50 local time, Lufthansa Flight 5 from Frankfurt to Bremen, {{which was}} {{operated}} using a Convair CV-440 <b>Metropolitan</b> registered D-ACAT, <b>crashed</b> [...] short of Bremen Airport, killing all 42 passengers and 4 crew members on board. The pilots {{had tried to}} execute a go-around when approaching the airport, during which the aircraft stalled and went out of control, possibly due to pilot error.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the common}} {{occurrence}} of rear end collisions in South Australia, and the costliness of Compulsory Third Party (CTP) claims associated with them, a study was undertaken into the nature of, and possible countermeasures for, rear end collisions. This study included an analysis of five years of police-reported crash data, an analysis of a sample of rear end crashes investigated {{as part of the}} CASR <b>metropolitan</b> in-depth <b>crash</b> study, and a literature review concerned with countermeasures for rear end crashes. The most common factors contributing to these types of crashes are the lack of protection for right turning vehicles and the inadequate allocation of attention by drivers to the driving task. Countermeasures are available for both of these contributing factors. Providing greater protection for right turning vehicles requires road-based countermeasures, while the most promising countermeasure for inadequate allocation of attention is the installation in vehicles of collision avoidance systems. However, the latter countermeasure will only be available after further testing and refinement of current prototype systems. M. R. J. Baldock, A. D. Long, V. L. Lindsay and A. J. McLea...|$|R
40|$|An {{increasing}} number of people are choosing to ride motorcycles for recreation, pleasure and for commuting. Furthermore, motorcycles have great environmental advantages over cars. However, there are also serious safety concerns. AIMS: The aim {{of this study is to}} provide a general descriptive account of trends over time from 1990 to 2009 for motorcycle crashes in South Australia. This is achieved through a comparison of age groups for total motorcycle crashes, single and multiple vehicles <b>crashes,</b> <b>metropolitan</b> and non-metropolitan high and low speed area crashes, and gender of the motorcyclist. DATABASES: Police-reported crash data (Traffic Accident Reporting System TARS) allowed a general exploratory account of motorcycle crashes in South Australia from 1990 to 2009.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the path of}} vehicles following a collision with another vehicle at a metropolitan intersection. The aim was to provide guidance to transport authorities on roadside design at intersections to protect vehicles from secondary impacts with roadside objects. Detailed information from in-depth investigations of 78 intersection crashes was analysed. Crashes at singalised and unsignalised intersections were analysed separately. Thirty two vehicles at signalised and unsignalised intersections (16 at each) {{were involved in a}} secondary collision. Nine of these collisions were more severe than the initial vehicle-to-vehicle collision, three at signalised intersections and six at unsignalised intersections. Following the vehicle-tovehicle impact at both signalised and unsignalised intersections, {{more than half of the}} vehicles came to rest within 10 metres of the impact point. However, more than a quarter travelled 15 metres or further and around 10 % travelled further than 27 metres. It was found that 40 % of vehicles at signalised intersections crossed the designated pedestrian crossing areas following a collision between vehicles. It was also found that 14 % of vehicles involved in crashes at signalised intersections departed the roadway. This poses a significant risk to pedestrians who are in the vicinity of junctions at the time of collisions. Graphical representations of the percentage of vehicles that travel through a given sector relative to the impact point following the <b>metropolitan</b> intersection <b>crashes</b> were developed. These can be used to determine the chance of a vehicle having a secondary collision with roadside objects. SD Doecke, JE Woolle...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the road}} system, there are {{compliant}} road users who may make an error {{that leads to}} a crash, resulting in a ‘system failure’, and there are also road users who deliberately take risks and display dangerous or ‘extreme’ behaviours that lead to a crash. Crashes resulting from system failures can be addressed through improvements to road system design more readily than crashes resulting from extreme behaviours. The classification of crash causation in terms of system failures or extreme behaviour is important for determining {{the extent to which a}} Safe System approach (i. e. improvements to road system design to serve compliant road users) is capable of reducing the number of crashes. This study examined the relative contribution of system failures and extreme behaviour in South Australian crashes as identified from information in Coroner’s investigation files (2008 - 2009) for 189 fatal crashes. The results were compared with data from CASR’s in-depth crash investigations for 272 nonfatal <b>metropolitan</b> injury <b>crashes</b> and 181 non-fatal rural crashes. The analysis found that that very few non-fatal <b>crashes</b> (3 % <b>metropolitan,</b> 9 % rural) involved extreme behaviour by road users and, even in fatal crashes, the majority (54 %) were the result of system failures. Fatal crashes resulting from system failures were more likely than those resulting from extreme behaviour to occur during the day, on weekdays, in rural areas and on roads with high speed limits. Findings from the current study suggest that improvements to the road transport system (i. e. forgiving road infrastructure, appropriate speed limits, and safe vehicle design) can be expected to be much more effective in reducing crashes than concentrating on preventing extreme behaviours. Such a strategy could reduce the incidence and severity of a large proportion of crashes in South Australia. LN Wundersitz, MRJ Baldock, SJ Rafter...|$|R
