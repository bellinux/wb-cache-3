The wide range of dates {{is due to the}} different records used to calibrate the molecular clock. One clade was the variola major strains (the more clinically severe form of smallpox) which spread from Asia between 400 and 1,600 years ago.

This is consistent with archaeological and historical evidence regarding {{the appearance}} of smallpox as a human disease which suggests a relatively recent origin. However, if the mutation rate is assumed to be {{similar to that of the}} herpesviruses, the divergence date between variola from Taterapox has been estimated to be 50,000 years ago.

5000|$|The Chinese {{practiced the}} oldest {{documented}} use of variolation, {{dating back to}} the fifteenth century. They implemented a method of [...] "nasal insufflation" [...] administered by blowing powdered smallpox material, usually scabs, up the nostrils. Various insufflation techniques have been recorded throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries within China. According to such documentation, <b>mild</b> <b>smallpox</b> cases were selected as donors in order to prevent serious attack. The technique used scabs that had been left to dry out for some time. Fresh scabs were more likely to lead to a full-blown infection. Three or four scabs were ground into powder or mixed with a grain of musk and bound in cotton. Infected material was then packed into a pipe and puffed up the patient's nostril. The practice of variolation {{is believed to have been}} ritualized by the Chinese. The blowpipe used during the procedure was made of silver. The right nostril was used for boys and the left for girls. Variolated cases were treated as if they were as infectious as those who had acquired the disease naturally. These patients were subsequently kept apart from others until the rash had cleared. Two reports on the Chinese practice were received by the Royal Society in London in 1700; one by Dr. Martin Lister who received a report by an employee of the East India Company stationed in China and another by Clopton Havers. But no action was taken.|$|E
50|$|In humans, monkeypox {{is similar}} to smallpox, {{although}} it is often <b>milder.</b> Vaccination against <b>smallpox</b> is assumed to provide protection against human monkeypox infection considering they are closely related viruses and the vaccine protects animals from experimental lethal monkeypox challenge.

50|$|The {{practice}} of smallpox inoculation (as {{opposed to the}} later {{practice of}} vaccination) was developed possibly in 8th-century India or 10th-century China. Spreading its reach in seventeenth-century Turkey, inoculation or, rather, variolation, involved infecting a person via {{a cut in the}} skin with exudate from a patient with a relatively <b>mild</b> case of <b>smallpox</b> (variola), to bring about a manageable and recoverable infection that would provide later immunity. By the beginning of the 18th century, the Royal Society in England was discussing the practice of inoculation, and the smallpox epidemic in 1713 spurred further interest. It was not until 1721, however, that England recorded its first case of inoculation.|$|R
50|$|Cowpox is an {{infectious}} disease {{caused by the}} cowpox virus. The virus, part of the orthopoxvirus family, {{is closely related to}} the vaccinia virus. The virus is zoonotic, meaning that it is transferable between species, such as from animal to human. The transferral of the disease was first observed in dairymaids who touched the udders of infected cows and consequently developed the signature pustules on their hands. Cowpox is more commonly found in animals other than bovines, such as rodents. Cowpox is similar to, but much milder than, the highly contagious and often deadly smallpox disease. Its close resemblance to the <b>mild</b> form of <b>smallpox</b> and the observation that dairymaids were immune from smallpox inspired the first smallpox vaccine, created and administered by English physician Edward Jenner.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAlastrim variola minor virus, {{which causes}} <b>mild</b> <b>smallpox,</b> was first {{recognized}} in Florida and South America {{in the late}} 19 th century. Genome linear double-stranded DNA sequences (186, 986 bp) of the alastrim virus Garcia- 1966, a laboratory reference strain from an outbreak associated with 0. 8 % case fatalities in Brazil in 1966, were determined except for a 530 -bp fragment of hairpin-loop sequences at each terminus. The DNA sequences (EMBL Accession No. Y 16780) showed 206 potential open reading frames for proteins containing ≥ 60 amino acids. The amino acid sequences of the putative proteins were compared with those reported for vaccinia virus strain Copenhagen and the Asian variola major strains India- 1967 and Bangladesh- 1975. About one-third of the alastrim viral proteins were 100 % identical to correlates in the variola major strains and the remainder were ≥ 95 % identical. Compared with variola major virus DNA, alastrim virus DNA has additional segments of 898 and 627 bp, respectively, within {{the left and right}} terminal regions. The former segment aligns well with sequences in other orthopoxviruses, particularly cowpox and vaccinia viruses, and the latter is apparently alastrim-specific...|$|E
40|$|Human disease likely {{attributable}} to variola virus (VARV), the etiologic agent of smallpox, {{has been reported}} in human populations for > 2, 000 years. VARV is unique among orthopoxviruses in that it is an exclusively human pathogen. Because VARV has a large, slowly evolving DNA genome, we were able to construct a robust phylogeny of VARV by analyzing concatenated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from genome sequences of 47 VARV isolates with broad geographic distributions. Our results show two primary VARV clades, which likely diverged from an ancestral African rodent-borne variola-like virus either ≈ 16, 000 or ≈ 68, 000 years before present (YBP), depending on which historical records (East Asian or African) are used to calibrate the molecular clock. One primary clade was represented by the Asian VARV major strains, the more clinically severe form of smallpox, which spread from Asia either 400 or 1, 600 YBP. Another primary clade included both alastrim minor, a phenotypically <b>mild</b> <b>smallpox</b> described from the American continents, and isolates from West Africa. This clade diverged from an ancestral VARV either 1, 400 or 6, 300 YBP, and then further diverged into two subclades at least 800 YBP. All of these analyses indicate that the divergence of alastrim and variola major occurred earlier than previously believed...|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores German efforts during 1754 - 1800 to {{curb the}} {{suffering}} and death from smallpox, known as the Würgengel (murdering angel) for carrying so many innocent young children to Heaven. It focusses on the period immediately before {{the introduction of the}} safer cowpox vaccination, when the highly controversial prophylactic, inoculation, was used in Germany. Inoculation entailed the insertion of a small amount of human smallpox matter into the skin to produce a usually <b>mild</b> <b>smallpox</b> disease that prevented more severe smallpox in future. As the epitome of the rationalist ideology that man should take control of his own destiny and as a novel example of disease prophylaxis, inoculation was closely aligned with the Enlightenment. This thesis shows that enlightened German princes, nobles, and high-profile women encouraged inoculation, yet the princes’ deliberate initiatives to spread inoculation in their territories generally failed and the university-educated cohort of German society drove the efforts to promote the advantages of inoculation and encourage its use, in the face of many obstacles. The intelligentsia which sought to promote behaviours consistent with enlightenment ideology played a prominent role in that regard. Not only as commentators and public officials but also as owners and editors of the new kinds of general journals, and as reviewers, they encouraged a positive public attitude to inoculation. Poets and writers played their part by turning fictional as well as real women who chose inoculation to save their beauty or children from smallpox into ‘inoculation heroines’. Like-minded university professors taught their students about inoculation, and doctors encouraged the practice by reporting inoculation successes and by teaching surgeons the procedures. Many pastors promoted inoculation in their sermons and in articles in various kinds of general journals, in some cases engaging in inoculation themselves. Yet, despite the encouragement to adopt inoculation and concerted efforts to dispel the doubts about it, for myriad different reasons inoculation failed to gain popularity, particularly among the non-elite. Reminders that isolation measures had banished bubonic plague in earlier times fuelled a wave of utopian optimism in the 1790 s that a reintroduction of such measures and a united effort could actually eradicate smallpox in the coming century which was being spruiked as a new age of peace and prosperity. The unrealistic goal of eradicating smallpox, considering the lack of new tools, was largely inspired by the revolutionaries in France casting aside the aristocratic governing class in 1789, demonstrating that seemingly impossible dreams could be achieved by a unity of purpose. This thesis shows the various ways in which the Enlightenment and other social, cultural, and political influences which pervaded Germany during the 1754 - 1800 period jointly shaped the approaches to combating smallpox by inoculation and other measures at that time...|$|E

50|$|Though it was {{practiced in}} many parts of the world, the {{technology}} of inoculation, or Variolation, was not known in Europe until the 1700s. It was widely publicized by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, who inoculated her own children against smallpox, despite widespread concern and controversy. Inoculation was the practice of introducing infected materials in to the bodies of healthy individuals with the hope that they would contract a <b>mild</b> form of <b>smallpox,</b> recover, and be immune to further infections. The outcome of inoculations in surviving patients was successful, these individuals proved to be immune to smallpox. Understandably, there was much concern surrounding the practice of inoculation. The ordinary person was unable to comprehend the efficacy of intentionally infecting an otherwise healthy person with a potentially fatal disease. Thus, many were reluctant to have themselves or their family members inoculated. There were instances in which these fears were validated. Many of those who had been inoculated died as a result of the smallpox they had been exposed to. Additionally, there was the potential for an accidental outbreak of smallpox after contact between inoculation patients and the public. The choice of significant individuals such as John Adams and Abigail Adams to be inoculated did some to make inoculations more accepted, but there was still much progress to be made.|$|R
5000|$|The {{practice}} of variolation (also known as inoculation) {{first came out}} of the Orient. [...] First writings documenting variolation in China appear around 1500. Scabs from smallpox victims who had the disease in its mild form would be selected, and the powder was kept close to body temperature by means of keeping it close to the chest, killing the majority of the virus and resulting in a more <b>mild</b> case of <b>smallpox.</b> Scabs were generally used when a month old, but could be used quicker in hot weather (15-20 days), and slower in winter (50 days). The process was carried out by taking eight smallpox scabs and crushing them in a mortar with two grains of Uvularia grandiflora in a mortar. The powder was administered nasally through a silver tube that was curved at its point, through the right nostril for boys and the left nostril for girls. A week after the procedure, those variolated would start to produce symptoms of smallpox, and recovery was guaranteed. In India, where the European colonizers came across variolation in the 17th century, a large, sharp needle was dipped into the pus collected from mature smallpox sores. Several punctures with this needle were made either below the deltoid muscle or in the forehead, and then were covered with a paste made from boiled rice. [...] Variolation spread further from India to other countries in south west Asia, and then to the Balkans.|$|R
2500|$|It was noticed {{during the}} 18th century {{that people who}} had {{suffered}} from the less virulent cowpox were immune to smallpox, and the first recorded use of this idea was by a farmer Benjamin Jesty at Yetminster in Dorset, who had suffered the disease and transmitted it to his own family in 1774, his sons subsequently not getting the <b>mild</b> version of <b>smallpox</b> when later inoculated in 1789. But it was Edward Jenner, a doctor in Berkeley in Gloucestershire, who established the procedure by introducing material from a cowpox vesicle on Sarah Nelmes, a milkmaid, into {{the arm of a}} boy named James Phipps. Two months later he inoculated the boy with smallpox and the disease did not develop. In 1798 Jenner published An Inquiry into the Causes and Effects of the Variolae Vacciniae, which coined the term vaccination and created widespread interest. He distinguished 'true' and 'spurious' cowpox (which did not give the desired effect) and developed an [...] "arm-to-arm" [...] method of propagating the vaccine from the vaccinated individual's pustule. Early attempts at confirmation were confounded by contamination with smallpox, but despite controversy within the medical profession and religious opposition to the use of animal material, by 1801 his report was translated into six languages and over 100,000 people were vaccinated. The second generation of vaccines was introduced in the 1880s by Louis Pasteur who developed vaccines for chicken cholera and anthrax, and from the late nineteenth century vaccines were considered a matter of national prestige, and compulsory vaccination laws were passed.|$|R
5|$|By the mid-18th century {{smallpox}} {{was a major}} {{endemic disease}} {{everywhere in the world}} except in Australia and in several small islands. In Europe smallpox was a leading cause of death in the 18th century, killing an estimated 400,000 Europeans each year. Up to 10 percent of Swedish infants died of smallpox each year, and the death rate of infants in Russia may have been even higher. The widespread use of variolation in a few countries, notably Great Britain, its North American colonies, and China, somewhat reduced the impact of smallpox among the wealthy classes during {{the latter part of the}} 18th century, but a real reduction in its incidence did not occur until vaccination became a common practice toward the end of the 19th century. Improved vaccines and the practice of re-vaccination led to a substantial reduction in cases in Europe and North America, but smallpox remained almost unchecked everywhere else in the world. In the United States and South Africa a much <b>milder</b> form of <b>smallpox,</b> variola minor, was recognized just before the close of the 19th century. By the mid-20th century variola minor occurred along with variola major, in varying proportions, in many parts of Africa. Patients with variola minor experience only a mild systemic illness, are often ambulant throughout the course of the disease, and are therefore able to more easily spread disease. Infection with v. minor induces immunity against the more deadly variola major form. Thus as v. minor spread all over the USA, into Canada, the South American countries and Great Britain it became the dominant form of smallpox, further reducing mortality rates.|$|R
40|$|North's {{clustering}} method, {{which is}} based on a much used ecological model, the nearest neighbor distance, was applied to the objective reconstruction of the chain of household-to-household transmission of variola minor (the <b>mild</b> form of <b>smallpox).</b> The discrete within-household outbreaks were considered as points which were ordered in a time sequence using a 10 - 40 day interval between introduction of the disease into a source household and a receptor household. The closer points in the plane were assumed to have a larger probability of being links of a chain of household-to-household spread of the disease. The five defining distances (Manhattan or city-block distance between presumptive source and receptor dwellings) were 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 m. The subchain sets obtained with the five defining distances were compared with the subchains empirically reconstructed during the field study of the epidemic through direct investigation of personal contacts of the introductory cases with either introductory or subsequent cases from previously affected households. The criteria of fit of theoretical to empirical clusters were: (a) the number of clustered dwellings and subchains, (b) number of dwellings in a subchain and (c) position of dwellings in a subchain. The defining distance closet to the empirical findings was 200 m, which fully agrees with the travelling habits of the study population. Less close but acceptable approximations were obtained with 100, 300, 400 and 500 m. The latter two distances gave identical results, as if a clustering ceiling had been reached. It seems that North's clustering model may be used for an objective reconstruction of the chain of contagious whose links are discrete within-household outbreaks. ...|$|R
40|$|Straightforward {{adaptation}} of geographical and regional-science models to conceptual modeling {{of the epidemic}} spread of a contagious disease is achieved by: (a) using analogies and isomorphisms, and (b) using as a real example the observations made during a well studied epidemic of variola minor (the <b>mild</b> form of <b>smallpox),</b> a typical contagious disease. The {{adaptation of}} the Wilson model of planning for urban development includes (a) a static view (network) of the structure and activities {{of the population and}} of organizations (diffusion agencies such as day schools), and (b) the dynamic view (mechanism of epidemic spread) which includes the changes with time of elements of the network brought by flow of disease. Adaptation of the Brown model of spatial diffusion yields flows of disease occurring between micro-scale units (households) of social interactions but aggregations of these units do not participate explicitly in the flows. The occurence of successive generations of affected households is specified as well as the occurence of definite stages of the epidemic progression. Adaptation of the Alves-Morrill model of spatial diffusion yields (a) a network of social groups and interdependencies; (b) a simplified network of the mechanism of spread that shows flows of disease between individuals grouped into generations of infected individuals and generations of infective individuals; and (c) a more realistic view which shows the flows of disease between real epidemiological units such as households and school classes. Adaptation of the Morrill-Manninen model of spatial diffusion concentrates on the mechanism and parameters having the epidemic spread as output. The interdependencies between the parameters and between each parameter and the epidemic spread are represented, including feedback processes. Brown's model seems to be the best for describing the epidemic spread of contagious disease while the Morrill-Manninen model is the most promising for investigating the detailed mechanism of the spread. Since these two models complement each other, their combined use is indicated. epidemiology methods epidemics smallpox...|$|R
5000|$|It {{is known}} {{that the process of}} {{inoculation}} was used by Chinese physicians in the 10th century. Scholar Ole Lund comments: [...] "The earliest documented examples of vaccination are from India and China in the 17th century, where vaccination with powdered scabs from people infected with smallpox was used to protect against the disease. Smallpox used to be a common disease throughout the world and 20 to 30% of infected persons died from the disease. Smallpox was responsible for 8 to 20% of all deaths in several European countries in the 18th century. The tradition of vaccination may have originated in India in AD 1000." [...] The mention of inoculation in the Sact'eya Grantham, an Ayurvedic text, was noted by the French scholar [...] in the journal [...]However, the idea that inoculation originated in India has been challenged, as few of the ancient Sanskrit medical texts described the process of inoculation. Accounts of inoculation against smallpox in China can be found as early as the late 10th century and was reportedly widely practised in China in the reign of the Longqing Emperor (r. 1567-72) during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). Two reports on the Chinese practice of inoculation were received by the Royal Society in London in 1700; one by Dr. Martin Lister who received a report by an employee of the East India Company stationed in China and another by Clopton Havers. According to Voltaire (1742), the Turks derived their use of inoculation to neighbouring Circassia. Voltaire does not speculate on where the Circassians derived their technique from, though he reports that the Chinese have practiced it [...] "these hundred years".The Greek physicians Emmanuel Timonis (1669-1720) from the island of Chios and Jacob Pylarinos (1659-1718) from Cephalonia practised smallpox inoculation at Constantinople in the beginning of 18th century and published their work in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1714. [...] This kind of inoculation and other forms of variolation were introduced into England by Lady Montagu, a famous English letter-writer and wife of the English ambassador at Istanbul between 1716 and 1718, who almost died from smallpox as a young adult and was physically scarred from it. Inoculation was adopted both in England and in America nearly half a century before Jenner's famous smallpox vaccine of 1796 [...] but the death rate of about 2% from this method meant that it was mainly used during dangerous outbreaks of the disease and remained controversial.It was noticed during the 18th century that people who had suffered from the less virulent cowpox were immune to smallpox, and the first recorded use of this idea was by a farmer Benjamin Jesty at Yetminster in Dorset, who had suffered the disease and transmitted it to his own family in 1774, his sons subsequently not getting the <b>mild</b> version of <b>smallpox</b> when later inoculated in 1789.
