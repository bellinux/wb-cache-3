50|$|HEPA filters {{alone are}} not enough for even the best vacuum cleaner to work effectively. Whether it’s bagged or bagless, a truly hypoallergenic vacuum {{requires}} that it have a completely sealed system.

However, some users who suffer from dust <b>mite</b> <b>allergies,</b> evidence a preference for bagless technology; as most of the dirt is trapped inside the chamber via the use of cyclonic technology, which is, by design, a potentially inherently cleaner technology.|$|R
50|$|Der p 1 is a {{major source}} of HDM allergies, {{triggering}} immunoglobulin E binding levels of 80-90% and, combined with the group 2 allergen Der p 2, accounting for over 50% of all HDM-related IgE binding.

Because of the prevalence of Der p 1 in <b>mite</b> <b>allergies,</b> developers of HDM allergy vaccines consider it necessary to factor in Der p 1. As a result, Der p 1 {{is a major}} component of mite allergen crude extracts and is frequently used as the basis of numerous hypoallergenic derivatives created in the refinement of specific immunotherapy.

40|$|Background: Prevalence of <b>mite</b> <b>allergy</b> {{continues}} to rise in most European countries. Long-lasting clinical benefit asks for lifelong allergen avoidance. The allergic reaction towards products of the mites is an immediate reaction that may {{be located in the}} lungs (asthma), the nose (rhinitis) or the skin (atopic dermatitis). The mites live in homes with a suitable indoor climate. This connects the <b>mite</b> <b>allergy</b> problem to indoor environmental quality as described in the domain of building physics. Earlier research has defined general biological threshold levels for sensitization and symptom development in <b>mite</b> <b>allergy,</b> and these levels have been related to environmental characteristics. However, more recent epidemiologic studies suggest that sensitization to mite products may take place even below these defined hygienic levels. For the relationship between environmental characteristics and mite allergen levels consensus has been lost. A meta-analysis of all controlled trials on mite allergen reduction levels by environmental means showed no clinical benefit. Apparently a more tailored guidance is needed for the well-being of those affected with <b>mite</b> <b>allergy.</b> This calls for a personalized management system of environmental means in patient practice. Aim of research: Developing an environmental methodology to monitor the critical control points for (mite) allergen levels in dwellings, incorporating both building physics performance and the life style in the inhabitants. Results so far indicate that robust algorithms are feasible to guide the monitoring and control process...|$|E

Whether it is a progressive condition resulting from allergic inflammation or a distinct condition involving a pathogen-induced reaction remains unclear. Objectives. To determine the role of allergic inflammation in the pathogenesis of elderly COPD. Methods. A total of 63 elderly adults (21 mite-allergic COPD patients, 29 non-allergic COPD patients, and 13 normal controls) were recruited in this study. The serum-specific IgE for mites, level of interleukin- 5 (IL- 5), IL- 8, leptin, adiponectin, regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), growth-related oncogene-alpha (GRO-alpha), vitamin E, and glutathione (GSH) were determined. Results. The serum levels of GRO-alpha in patients with COPD were higher in comparison to normal controls (105. 8 +/- 32. 7 vs. 7. 5 +/- 7. 5 pg/mL, p =. 021). Compared to patients with non-allergic COPD, patients with <b>mite</b> <b>allergies</b> had a higher serum level of IL- 8 (63. 2 +/- 12. 6 vs. 35. 0 +/- 8. 2 pg/mL, p =. 022).

There were also no differences in serum levels of leptin, adiponectin, vitamin E, and GSH between COPD patients and normal controls. Conclusions. The increased serum levels of GRO-alpha indicate that it may have potential as a candidate biomarker for elderly COPD patients. There was no difference of eosinophils-related chemokines in allergic and non-allergic COPD. These results indicated that both adipokines and eosinophil-related chemokines only play trivial roles in the pathogenesis of COPD...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. House dust mites {{have lived}} in human contact from time immemorial. Human dander or dead skin {{constitutes}} the major organic component of the house dust ecosystem. Because the mites feed on dander, dust mites and human association will continue to co-exist {{as part of our}} environment. Efficient house-keeping practice is the best form of control to reduce infestation. However, special precautions are important when individuals are susceptible or sensitive to dust mites. House dust mites are responsible for causing asthma, rhinitis and contact dermatitis. The respiratory allergies are caused by the inhalation of dead or live mites, their faecal matter or other byproducts. Immune factors are of paramount importance in the development of dust related or mite induced respiratory diseases. House dust mites were found in some 1, 000 samples of dust taken from approximately 330 dwellings in Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore. Mattresses, carpets, corners of a bedroom, and floor beneath the bed are favourable dust mite habitats. The incriminating species based on studies here and elsewhere, as well as many other species of dust mites of unknown etiological importance are widely distributed in Malaysian homes. Density of dust mites in Malaysia and Singapore is greater than in temperate countries. Prevention and control measures with reference to subjects sensitive to dust <b>mite</b> <b>allergies,</b> including chemical control described in studies conducted in Europe and America are discussed. However, a cost free and most practical way to remove mites, their faecal matter and other products is to resort to sunning the bedding and carpets to kill the living mites, and then beaten and brushed to remove the dust and other components...|$|R
