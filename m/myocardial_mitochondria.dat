50|$|Meldonium is {{believed}} to continually train the heart pharmacologically, even without physical activity, inducing preparation of cellular metabolism and membrane structures (specifically in <b>myocardial</b> <b>mitochondria)</b> to survive ischemic stress conditions. This is done by adapting myocardial cells to lower fatty acid inflow and by activating glycolysis; the heart eventually begins using glycolysis instead of beta oxidation during real life ischaemic conditions. This reduces oxidative stress on cells, formation of cytotoxic products of fatty acid oxidation and subsequent cellular damage. This has made meldonium a possible pharmacological agent for ischemic preconditioning.|$|E

In cardioprotective {{maneuvers}} such as ischemic and pharmacological pre- and postconditioning mitochondria have a decisive role. Since about 99 % of the mitochondrial proteins are encoded in the nucleus, deleterious and protective mitochondrial effects most likely comprise the import of cytosolic proteins. The present review therefore discusses the role of <b>mitochondria</b> in <b>myocardial</b> ischemia/reperfusion injury and protection from it, focusing on some cytosolic proteins, which are translocated into mitochondria before, during, or following ischemia/reperfusion.

40|$|Myeloid cell leukemia- 1 (MCL- 1) is an {{anti-apoptotic}} BCL- 2 {{protein that}} is upregulated in several human cancers. MCL- 1 is also highly expressed in myocardium, but its function in myocytes {{has not been}} investigated. To study this function, I generated inducible, cardiomyocyte-specific Mcl- 1 knockout mice and found that loss of MCL- 1 in the adult heart led to rapid cardiomyopathy, cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis with loss of myocytes, and early mortality. Although MCL- 1 is known to inhibit apoptosis, this process was not activated in MCL- 1 -deficient hearts. Instead, ultrastructural analysis revealed disorganized sarcomeres and swollen mitochondria in myocytes. I found that loss of MCL- 1 led to mitochondrial rupture, LDH release, and cardiac inflammation that indicate <b>myocardial</b> necrosis. <b>Mitochondria</b> isolated from MCL- 1 -deficient hearts also exhibited reduced respiration, impaired oxidative phosphorylation enzyme activity, and reduced Ca²⁺-mediated swelling. Taken together, these data are consistent with mitochondrial damage and opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). Double knockout mice lacking MCL- 1 and cyclophilin D, an essential regulator of the mPTP, exhibited delayed progression to heart failure and extended survival. Autophagy is normally enhanced in response to myocardial stress, but induction of autophagy was impaired in MCL- 1 - deficient hearts. Accordingly, I found that ablation of MCL- 1 led to accumulation of autophagic substrates in cardiac tissue. In addition, the loss of MCL- 1 compromised mitochondrial turnover in myocardium by disrupting PINK 1 / Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Finally, my studies show that MCL- 1 and Parkin do not directly interact in the heart. These data demonstrate that MCL- 1 is essential for myocardial homeostasis and induction of autophagy in cardiac myocytes. My dissertation also raises concerns about potential cardiotoxicity for chemotherapeutics that target MCL-...|$|R
40|$|Objective 　To {{study the}} effect of {{different}} exercise intensity on the expression of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP 2) in mitochondria of rat myocardium, and investigate the correlation and significance between energy metabolism and UCP 2. Methods　Forty five male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 3 groups (15 each) : normal control (NC) group, endurance exercise (EnE) group and exhaustive exercise (ExE) group. Four weeks later, both the serum concentration of free fatty acid (FFA) {{and the content of}} ATP in <b>myocardial</b> <b>mitochondria</b> were measured. The expression of UCP 2 in <b>myocardial</b> <b>mitochondria</b> was assessed with RT-PCR and Western blotting. Results　The content of ATP was lower in ExE group than that in NC and EnE group (P< 0. 01). The serum FFA concentration in ExE group was 2. 0 folds and 1. 7 folds higher than in that of NC group and EnE group, respectively (P< 0. 01). The results of RT-PCR and Western blotting indicated that the expression of UCP 2 in <b>myocardial</b> <b>mitochondria</b> was significantly up-regulated in ExE group as compared with that of NC and EnE groups (P< 0. 01). Correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between expression of UCP 2 and serum FFA concentration (r= 0. 795, P< 0. 01), while a negative correlation was found between expression of UCP 2 and ATP content (r=– 0. 843, P< 0. 01). Conclusions　Exhaustive exercise may increase serum FFA concentration and decrease <b>myocardial</b> <b>mitochondria</b> ATP content, and it may induce <b>myocardial</b> <b>mitochondria</b> UCP 2 expression at the same time. UCP 2 expression is positively correlated with FFA concentration, but it was negatively correlated with the ATP content, implying that UCP 2 may participate in the process of myocardial energy metabolism during exhaustion exercise.

40|$|Objective　To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} compound Tianqi Hangli tablet on the function of <b>myocardial</b> <b>mitochondria</b> in rats after high +Gz stress exposure. Methods　Seventy-two male SD rats were randomly divided into 6 groups (12 each) : blank control group, stress control group, high +Gz stress group, low dose compound group, medium dose compound group, and high dose compound group. Tianqi Hangli tablet was administered orally to rats once a day for 14 days. Low-, medium- and high dose compound group were fed with compound Tianqi Hangli tablet at doses of 0. 75, 1. 5 and 3. 0 g/kg, respectively. Rats in the other three groups were fed with equal volume of saline. Experimental rats were exposed to high +Gz at the 15 th day. The respiratory function, antioxidant capacity and ATPase activity of <b>myocardial</b> <b>mitochondria</b> were detected after +Gz exposure. Results　Compared with blank control group and stress control groups, the state 3 respiration (ST 3) and respiratory control ratio (RCR) of <b>myocardial</b> <b>mitochondria</b> of rats in high +Gz stress group significantly decreased (P< 0. 01), the state 4 respiration (ST 4) significantly increased (P< 0. 05), the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and Na+-K+-ATPase decreased (P< 0. 05 or P< 0. 01), but the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) increased (P< 0. 01). However, compound preconditioning increased ST 3 and RCR, and enhanced the activities of antioxidant enzymes and ATPase in rats suffering + 10 Gz exposure. The ST 3, RCR and the activities of antioxidant enzymes and ATPase of rats in high dose compound group {{were significantly higher than}} those in high +Gz stress group (P< 0. 05, P< 0. 01), SOD activity was even higher than those in blank control group (P< 0. 05), and the MDA content declined significantly (P< 0. 01). Conclusion　Compound Tianqi Hangli tablet may have a protective effect on <b>myocardial</b> <b>mitochondria</b> in rats after high +Gz stress exposure via ameliorating respiratory function, enhancing antioxidant capacity, as well as improving ATPase activity.

Results: Myocardial I-R injury caused {{an increase in the}} sensitivity of mitochondria to Ca 2 + -stimulated PT in vitro. The enhanced sensitivity to mitochondrial PT was associated with increases in mitochondrial Ca 2 + content as well as the extent of reactive oxidant species production in vitro and cytochrome c release in vivo. The cardioprotection afforded by Sch B pretreatment against I-R-induced injury was paralleled by the decrease in the sensitivity of <b>myocardial</b> <b>mitochondria</b> to Ca 2 + -stimulated PT, particularly under I-R conditions.

40|$|Background: Volatile anesthetics {{are known}} to limit <b>myocardial</b> ischemia-reperfusion injuries. <b>Mitochondria</b> were shown to be major {{contributors}} to cardioprotection. Cyclophilin D (CypD) {{is one of the}} main regulators of mitochondria-induced cell death. We compared the effect of isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane in the presence or absence of CypD, to clarify its role in the mechanism of cardioprotection induced by these anesthetics. Methods: Oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial membrane potential, and H 2 O 2 production were measured in isolated mitochondria from wild-type (WT) or CypD knockout mice in basal conditions and after hypoxia-reoxygenation in the presence or absence of volatile anesthetics. Results: All volatile anesthetics inhibited mitochondrial state 3 of complex I, decreased membrane potential, and increased adenosine diphosphate consumption duration in both WT and CypD knockout mice. However, they differently modified H 2 O 2 production after stimulation by succinate: CypD ablation reduced H 2 O 2 production, isoflurane decreased H 2 O 2 level in WT but not in CypD knockout mice, sevoflurane affected both lines whereas desflurane increased H 2 O 2 production in CypD knockout and had no effect on WT mice. Conclusions: This study showed different effects of isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane on mitochondrial functions and highlighted the implication of CypD in the regulation of adenosine diphosphate consumption and complex I-induced radical oxygen species production...|$|R

Methods 　Thirty healthy adult male Wistar rats {{were randomly assigned}} to three groups (10 each) : quiet control group (C), exhausted exercise group (E) and exhausted exercise plus trimetazidine group (TE). Exhausted exercise model was established by forcing the rats swim ceaselessly, rats in group TE received hydrochloric acid trimetazidine (10 mg/kg) for intervention. The myocardial tissue of rats was collected after the last exhausted exercise. The myocardial tissue of rats was evaluated by HE staining. The concentrations of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase 1 (GSH-Px) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in rats' <b>myocardial</b> cell <b>mitochondria</b> were detected by spectrophotometry. RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were performed to quantify the mRNA and protein levels of Bax, Bcl- 2 and uncoupling protein 2 (UCP 2) in myocardial tissue of rats. Terminal-deoxynucleoitidyl Transferase Mediated Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) assay was employed to detect the apoptotic rate of myocardial tissue. Results 　Compared with group C, the SOD and GSH-Px activities in groups E and TE were reduced (P< 0. 01), while the MDA activity was increased (P< 0. 01), and more obvious changes were in group E. The SOD and GSH-Px activities decreased, while the MDA activity increased in group E than in group TE (P< 0. 01). Compared with group C, the apoptotic rate of myocardial tissue increased in groups E and TE (P< 0. 01), and the highest apoptotic rate was in group E (P< 0. 01). Furthermore, the mRNA and protein levels of Bax were significantly elevated in groups E and TE (P< 0. 01), and the highest expression was in group E (P< 0. 01). The mRNA and protein levels of BCL- 2 were significantly reduced in groups E and TE (P< 0. 01), and the lowest expression was in group E (P< 0. 01). Meanwhile, compared with group C, the mRNA and protein expression of UCP 2 was significantly increased in groups E and TE (P< 0. 01). After treatment with hydrochloric acid trimetazidine, the UCP 2 expression in group TE was relative decreased than in group E (P< 0. 01). Conclusion 　Trimetazidine can reduce the oxidative stress and apoptotic rate of myocardial tissue of rats after exhausted exercise, indicating it plays an important protective role for the myocardial tissue of rats.

40|$|AbstractObjectives: Mitochondrial {{abnormalities}} {{have been}} described in cardiac tissue of patients with heart failure. These changes may result from chronic hypoxia. Our goal {{was to determine whether}} mitochondrial functional capacity can be improved in patients with heart failure by means of long-term left ventricular assist device therapy, which improves myocardial oxygen supply by decreasing <b>myocardial</b> work. Methods: <b>Mitochondria</b> were isolated from myocardial tissue obtained from 13 patients with heart failure without a left ventricular assist device (HF group) and seven patients with heart failure treated with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD-HF group). Mitochondrial respiratory rates (State 2, State 3, and State 4) were measured by means of polarographic techniques with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide–dependent (pyruvate/malate, α-ketoglutarate, glutamate) and –independent (succinate) substrates. The respiratory control index of Chance (State 3 /State 4) and Lardy (State 3 /State 2) and phosphorus to oxygen ratios were determined. Results: The respiratory control index of Chance was higher in LVAD-HF than in HF when using NADH-dependent substrates pyruvate/malate and α-ketoglutarate (pyruvate/malate HF: 4. 9  ± 1. 0; LVAD-HF: 6. 5  ± 1. 5; α-ketoglutarate HF: 8. 5  ± 2. 4; LVAD-HF: 11. 8  ± 2. 9; both p = 0. 04). Similarly, the respiratory control index of Lardy was greater in the LVAD-HF than the HF group when α-ketoglutarate and glutamate were used as substrates (α-ketoglutarate HF: 7. 8  ± 1. 7; LVAD-HF: 9. 9  ± 1. 5; glutamate HF: 7. 6  ± 2. 2; LVAD-HF: 10. 7  ± 2. 1; both p = 0. 04). The phosphorus to oxygen ratio was comparable for both groups using all substrates. No change in mitochondrial respiration was observed after left ventricular assist device therapy with the NADH-independent substrate, succinate. Conclusion: Cardiomyocyte mitochondrial function is improved by long-term therapy with a left ventricular assist device. This improvement suggests that cardiomyocyte metabolic dysfunction in heart failure may be reversed with left ventricular assist device support. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1998; 116 : 344 - 9...|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{verapamil}} on the abnormalities in {{fatty acid}} oxidation of myocardium. The oxidation of long (LCFA) and short chain fatty acids (SCFA) by <b>myocardial</b> <b>mitochondria</b> is impaired in CRF due to reduced activity of carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT) and of enzymes in the β-oxidation sequence in mitochondrial matrix. It was proposed that PTH, through {{its ability to}} augment entry of calcium into cells, enhances calcium uptake by the myocardium leading to calcium accumulation which in turn affects mitochondrial function. A calcium channel blocker may therefore correct these derangements. The present study {{examined the effects of}} verapamil on LCFA and SCFA oxidation and on CPT activity of <b>myocardial</b> <b>mitochondria</b> and on 45 Ca uptake by, and calcium content of, myocardium obtained from CRF rats and rats treated with PTH, with and without administration of verapamil. Both four days of PTH administration and 21 days of CRF produced significant (P < 0. 01) reduction in the oxidation of LCFA and SCFA by and of CPT activity of <b>myocardial</b> <b>mitochondria</b> and a significant increase in 45 Ca uptake by, and content of, the myocardium. Simultaneous administration of verapamil reversed all these derangements. Administration of verapamil alone to normal rats for 4 or 21 days did not cause significant changes in these parameters. The results of our studies are consistent with the notion that the alterations in myocardial oxidation of LCFA and SCFA in CRF or after PTH treatment are related to PTH-induced calcium accumulation in the heart, and could be reversed by a calcium channel blocker. The data could provide a rational therapeutic approach for the management of uremic myocardi-opathy...|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} research, {{we showed}} that 16 -week-old urea transporter B (UT-B) null mice have an atrial-ventricular conduction block, and hypothesized myocardial mitochondrial dysfunction. To investigate the mechanism of this block, we examined the proteomic differences in the <b>myocardial</b> <b>mitochondria</b> of UT-B null and wild-type mice with nanoscale LC-MS/MS. Of 26 proteins clearly downregulated in the UT-B null mice, 15 are involved in complexes I, III, IV, and V of the respiratory chain, which would strongly reduce {{the activity of the}} electron transport chain. Excess electrons from complexes I and III pass directly to O- 2 to generate ROS and deplete ROS-scavenging enzymes. Myocardial intracellular ROS were significantly higher in UT-B null mice than in wild-type mice (p < 0. 01), constituting an important cause of oxidative stress injury in the myocardia of UT-B null mice. The mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psi m) was also lower in UT-B null mice than in wild-type mice (p < 0. 05), causing oxidative phosphorylation dysfunction of complex V and insufficient ATP in the myocardial cells of UT-B null mice. HADHA (a trifunctional protein) and HSP 60 were also downregulated in the UT-B null <b>myocardial</b> <b>mitochondria.</b> These results confirm that mitochondrial dysfunction underlies the pathogenesis of the atrial-ventricular conduction block in UT-B null mice...|$|E

Mitochondrial dysfunction {{is known to}} have {{a significant role in the}} development and complications of ACM. This study investigated if chronic ethanol feeding promoted myocardial mitochondrial topo-isomerase dysfunction as one underlying cause of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage and mitochondrial dysfunction in ACM. Methods: The impact of chronic ethanol exposure on the <b>myocardial</b> <b>mitochondria</b> was examined in both neonatal cardiomyocytes using 50 mM ethanol for 6 days and in rats assigned to control or ethanol feeding groups for 4 months. Results: Chronic ethanol feeding led to significant (P < 0. 05) decreases in M-mode Fractional Shortening, ejection fraction, and the cardiac output index as well as increases in Tau. Ethanol feeding promoted mitochondrial dysfunction as evidenced by significantly decreased left ventricle cyto-chrome oxidase activity and decreases in mitochondrial protein content. Both in rats and in cultured cardiomyocytes, chronic ethanol presentation significantly increased mtDNA damage. Using isolated <b>myocardial</b> <b>mitochondria,</b> both mitochondrial topoisomerase-dependent DNA cleavage and DNA relaxation were significantly altered by ethanol feeding. Conclusion: Chronic ethanol feeding com-promised cardiovascular and mitochondrial function as a result of a decline in mtDNA integrity that was in part the consequence of mitochondrial topoisomerase dysfunction.

RT-PCR revealed that the expressions of UCP 2 mRNA were up-regulated by 64 % and 24 %, respectively, in single exhaustive exercise group and CPDS group when compared with that in control group. Western blotting showed that the expressions of UCP 2 were increased by 65 % and 26 %, respectively, in single exhaustive exercise group and CPDS group when compared with that in control group. Correlation analysis showed a significant positive correlation of the expression of myocardial UCP 2 to the concentration of plasma FFA (r= 0. 98, P< 0. 01), also of the concentration of plasma FFA to the levels of plasma E and NE (r= 0. 93, r= 0. 88, P< 0. 01). Conclusions　After exhaustive exercise, the expression of myocardial UCP 2 is significantly up-regulated, the synthesis of ATP reduced, and the energy metabolism disturbed, which {{may be one of}} the mechanisms leading to sudden cardiac death in sports training. Meanwhile, supplement of external CPDS may antagonize the increased expression of UCP 2 induced by exercise stress, increase ATP reserves and improve the energy metabolism, and it may have a positive effect on prevention of sudden cardiac death induced by exhaustive exercise.

Major sources of O 2 free radicals formation during ischaemia and reperfusion are: the enzyme xanthine oxidase, activated neutrophils and the <b>myocardial</b> <b>mitochondria.</b> However, in the heart there are defense mechanisms against the toxic oxygen metabolites.

Langendorff-perfused isolated rat hearts {{were subjected to}} global I/R and received IPo in the absence or presence of the mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channel (mitoKATP) blocker 5 -hydroxydecanoate (5 -HD). <b>Myocardial</b> <b>mitochondria</b> were extracted and mitochondrial comparative proteomics was analyzed. IPo significantly reduces post-ischemic myocardial infarction and improved cardiac function in I/R rat hearts, while 5 -HD basically cancelled IPo’s myocardial protective effect. Joint application of two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2 DE) and MALDI-TOF MS identified eight differentially expressed proteins between groups. Expression of cardiac succinate dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) flavoprotein subunit (SDHA) increased more than two-fold after I/R, while IPo led to overexpression of dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (DLD), NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) flavoprotein 1 and isoform CRA_b (NDUFV 1). When the mitoKATP was blocked, MICOS complex subunit Mic 60 (IMMT) and Stress- 70 protein (Grp 75) were over expressed, while DLDH, ATPase subunit A (ATPA) and rCG 44606 were decreased. Seven of the differential proteins belong to electron transport chain (ETC) or metabolism regulating proteins, and five of them were induced by closing mitoKATP in I/R hearts. We thus conclude that IPo’s myocardial protective effect relies on energy homeostasis regulation. DLD, SDHA, NDUFV 1, Grp 75, ATPA and rCG 44606 may contribute to IPo’s cardial protective effect...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} cold storage using Custodiol® (Histidine-Tryptophan-Ketoglutarate, HTK) or {{isotonic}} saline solution on mitochondrial function in hearts (left and rights ventricles) and various blood vessels of pigs were investigated. Hearts, saphenous veins, internal-mammary-arteries and aortas of male landrace pigs were harvested and exposed to cold ischemia in either saline or Custodiol-HTK solution. Mitochondrial function {{was measured in}} situ in permeabilized fibers by high-resolution respirometry. Mitochondrial respiratory capacities (maximal respiration rates) were similar in {{the right and left}} ventricle in controls and after 14 h of cold storage were significantly better preserved in Custodiol-HTK than in saline solution. Mitochondrial respiration rates in various blood vessels including aorta, arteries and veins were less than 5 % of myocardium rates. In contrast to the pig heart, in some blood vessels, like veins, mitochondrial function remained stable even after 24 h of cold ischemia. HTK-Custodiol protection of mitochondrial function after prolonged cold ischemia was observed in the myocardium but not in blood vessels. HTK-Custodiol solution thus offers significant protection of <b>myocardial</b> <b>mitochondria</b> against cold ischemic injury and can be used as efficient preservation solution in organ transplantation but probably has no benefit for blood vessels preservation. Analysis of mitochondrial function {{can be used as a}} valuable approach for the assessment of cold ischemic injury in various tissues including pig heart and various blood vessels...|$|E
40|$|Aerobic {{interval}} training (AIT) can favorably affect cardiovascular diseases. However, {{the effects of}} AIT on post-myocardial infarction (MI) —associated mitochondrial dysfunctions remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of AIT on <b>myocardial</b> <b>mitochondria</b> in post-MI rats by focusing on mitochondrial dynamics (fusion and fission). Mitochondrial respiratory functions (as measured by the respiratory control ratio (RCR) and the ratio of ADP to oxygen consumption (P/O)); complex activities; dynamic proteins (mitofusin (mfn) 1 / 2, type 1 optic atrophy (OPA 1) and dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP 1)); nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 -alpha (PGC- 1 α); and the oxidative signaling of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 / 2, c-Jun NH 2 -terminal protein kinase (JNK) and P 53 were observed. Post-MI rats exhibited mitochondrial dysfunction and adverse mitochondrial network dynamics (reduced fusion and increased fission), which was associated with activated ERK 1 / 2 -JNK-P 53 signaling and decreased nuclear PGC- 1 α. After AIT, MI-associated mitochondrial dysfunction was improved (elevated RCR and P/O and enhanced complex I, III and IV activities); in addition, increased fusion (mfn 2 and OPA 1), decreased fission (DRP 1), elevated nuclear PGC- 1 α and inactivation of the ERK 1 / 2 -JNK-P 53 signaling were observed. These data demonstrate that AIT may restore the post-MI mitochondrial function by inhibiting dynamics pathological remodeling, which {{may be associated with}} inactivation of ERK 1 / 2 -JNK-P 53 signaling and increase in nuclear PGC- 1 α expression...|$|E
40|$|Mechanisms {{responsible}} for alcohol-induced heart muscle disease {{have been difficult}} to elucidate partly because of previously obscure, demonstrable cardiac metabolism of ethanol. Recently, fatty acid ethyl esters were identified in our laboratory and found to be myocardial metabolites of ethanol. In the present study, they have been shown to induce mitochondrial dysfunction. Incubation of isolated <b>myocardial</b> <b>mitochondria</b> with fatty acid ethyl esters led to a concentration-dependent reduction of the respiratory control ratio index of coupling of oxidative phosphorylation and decrement of maximal rate of oxygen consumption. Furthermore, fatty acid ethyl esters were demonstrated to bind to mitochondria in vitro, and, importantly, 72 % of intracellularly synthesized ethyl esters were found to bind to mitochondria isolated from intact tissue incubated with ethanol. Protein binding of fatty acid ethyl esters was markedly less than that of fatty acids. Because uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation correlated with the cleavage of fatty acid ethyl ester shown to be initially bound to mitochondria, with resultant generation of fatty acid, a potent uncoupler, in a locus in or near the mitochondrial membrane, fatty acid ethyl esters may contribute to a potentially toxic shuttle for fatty acid with transport from physiological intracellular binding sites to the mitochondrial membrane; direct effects of fatty acid ethyl esters may also be deleterious. Operation of this shuttle as a result of ethanol ingestion and subsequent accumulation of fatty acid ethyl esters may account for the impaired mitochondrial function and inefficient energy production associated with toxic effects of ethanol on the heart...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDietary n- 3 {{polyunsaturated}} {{fatty acids}} (PUFA) reduce {{coronary heart disease}} (CHD) complications, such as chronic arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. Improved myocardial resistance to ischemia-reperfusion injury results in smaller myocardial infarction, which {{is a major factor}} in the occurrence of CHD complications. We hypothesized that a specific dietary fatty acid profile (low in saturated and n- 6 PUFA but high in plant and marine n- 3 PUFA) may improve myocardial resistance to ischemia-reperfusion injury and reduce infarct size. To test this assumption, we used a well-defined rat model of myocardial infarction. Based on our results, in comparison to a diet that is high in either saturated or n- 6 PUFA but poor in plant and marine n- 3 PUFA, a diet that is low in saturated fats and n- 6 PUFA but rich in plant and marine n- 3 PUFA results in smaller myocardial infarct size (P <. 01). The effects of the 3 diets were also examined by analyzing the fatty acid composition of plasma, erythrocyte cell membranes, and the phospholipids of <b>myocardial</b> <b>mitochondria.</b> The results show a great accumulation of n- 3 PUFA and a parallel decrease in arachidonic acid, the main n- 6 PUFA, in plasma, cell membranes, and cardiac mitochondria (P <. 0001). We conclude that improved myocardial resistance to ischemia-reperfusion may be one of the critical factors explaining the protective effects of dietary n- 3 PUFA against CHD complications in humans. In addition to increasing n- 3 PUFA intake, an optimal dietary pattern aimed at reducing cardiovascular mortality should include a reduction of the intake of both saturated and n- 6 PUFA...|$|E

Methods and results: Sprague Dawley rats were pretreated with QSYQ or saline for 7  days {{and subjected to}} ischemia (30  minutes occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery) and reperfusion (120  minutes). Cardiac functions were evaluated by echocardiogram and hemodynamics. <b>Myocardial</b> <b>mitochondria</b> were obtained to evaluate changes in mitochondrial structure and function, immediately after 120  minutes reperfusion. Pretreatment with QSYQ protected against I/R-induced myocardial structural injury and improved cardiac hemodynamics, as demonstrated by normalized serum creatine kinase and suppressed oxidative stress. Moreover, the impaired myocardial mitochondrial structure and function decreased level of ATP (accompanied by reduction of ATP 5 D and increase in the expression of cytochrome C). Myocardial fiber rupture, interstitial edema, and infiltrated leukocytes were all significantly ameliorated by pretreatment with QSYQ. Conclusion: Pretreatment of QSYQ in Sprague Dawley rats improves ventricular function and energy metabolism and reduces oxidative stress via ameliorating multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions during I/R injury.

Sixty-one adult mongrel dogs were classified into eight groups according to premedication: 1) control group, physiologic saline solution was administered intravenously 25 min before left anterior descending coronary artery ligation; 2) aprindine group, 3 mg/kg body weight of aprindine intravenously; 3) disopyramide group, 2 mg/kg of disopyramide intravenously; 4) flecainide group, 2 mg/kg of flecainide intravenously followed by drip infusion of 100 μg/kg per min; 5) lidocaine group, 2 mg/kg of lidocaine intravenously followed by drip infusion of 100 gmg/kg per min; 6) mexiletine group, 3 mg/kg per min of mexiletine intravenously followed by drip infusion of 15 μ/kg per min; 7) pentisomide group, 5 mg/kg intravenously; and 8) propafenone group, 2 mg/kg intravenously. Arterial blood pressure and electrocardiogram were monitored throughout the experiment. Two hours after coronary occlusion, the heart was excised. <b>Myocardial</b> <b>mitochondria</b> were prepared and mitochondrial function (the respiratory control index and the rate of oxygen consumption in state 111) was measured polarographically. Fractionation of myocardial tissues was performed and the lysosomal enzyme (N-acetyl-β-glucos-aminidase and β-glucuronidase) activities among fractions were measured. No significant hemodynamic changes were observed compared with the control group except for those in the disopyramide and flecainide groups; that is, decrease in heart rate without changes in blood pressure compared with the control group was observed. All antiarrhythmic drugs effectively prevented the development of ventricular arrhythmias associated with ischemia. Two hours of coronary occlusion induced mitochondrial dysfunction and leakage of lysosomal enzymes. In contrast, each antiarrhythmic drug without exception lessened mitochondrial dysfunction and prevented the leakage of lysosomal enzymes concomitantly. These results indicate that class I antiarrhythmic drugs have cardioprotective effects on ischemic myocardium...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the mechanism of}} ventricular arrhythmias induced by epinephrine in dogs with hypokalemia, 30 adult mongrel dogs were separated into a control group (n = 13) and a hypokalemia group (n = 17). In the hypokalemia group, sodium polystyrene sulfonate (5 g/kg body weight) was infused into the colon. In both groups, the serum concentrations of sodium, potassium and calcium were measured every 15 minutes for 60 minutes. The mean (± standard deviation) serum potassium level of the hypokalemia group decreased significantly from 3. 81 ± 0. 21 to 2. 92 ± 0. 36 mEq/liter; {{there were no significant}} changes in other electrolytes. After 60 minutes, epinephrine (10 μg/kg) was injected intravenously in the hypokalemia and control groups, and the arrhythmia ratio (the number of ventricular ectopic beats divided by the total heart rate) was calculated for 5 minutes. Each group was further classified into subgroups of dogs with an arrhythmia ratio higher or lower than 10 %. An arrhythmia ratio over 10 % was observed in 7. 7 % of the control group and 53 % of the hypokalemia group. Immediately after 5 minutes of epinephrine injection, <b>myocardial</b> <b>mitochondria</b> and plasma membrane fraction were prepared from each group. Mitochondrial calcium content and phospholipase activity of plasma membrane fraction were determined. Significant increases in both mitochondrial calcium content and phospholipase activity were observed in the dogs with hypokalemia and an arrhythmia ratio greater than 10 %. In the hypokalemia group, there was a clear reciprocal correlation (r = − 0. 79) between serum potassium concentration at 60 minutes and mitochondrial calcium content, and a clear correlation (r = 0. 80) between mitochondrial calcium content and phospholipase activity. It was also demonstrated that the dogs with a higher than 10 % arrhythmia ratio had a low serum potassium concentration, high mitochondrial calcium content and high phospholipase activity. These results suggest that hypokalemia enhances the calcium influx induced by epinephrine, resulting in activation of phospholipase, which is responsible for the development of ventricular arrhythmias...|$|E
