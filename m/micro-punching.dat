The parts ’ dimensions of the punch were first determined by the specification of the plastic carrier tape. The parts would be manufactured and assembled, {{and the performance of}} the punch was tested subsequently. Variation of dimensional accuracy of the plastic carrier tape was inspected to evaluate the performance of the punch. Mean and variance test was conducted under the significance level of α = 0. 05. Through these inspections, all the plastic carrier tape met the specifications of dimensional accuracy, which indicated that the precision and performance of the developed <b>micro-punching</b> mold also met the requirement...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} paper {{is focused on the}} optimal clearance design of <b>micro-punching</b> die by abductive network and SA method. Design/methodology/approach: The punching data (input) and wear size (output) were collected for a training database. In order to select proper clearance to evaluate the wear of die, the abductive network was used to establish an efficient relationship between input parameters and output result. This can help to predict wear size under any degree of clearance and hence to replace worn punches and dies at the right time. A simulated annealing (SA) optimization algorithm with a performance index is then applied to the neural network for searching the optimal clearance parameters, and obtains rather satisfactory result as compared with the corresponding experiment verification. Findings: This study aims to identify the relationship between clearance and service life of micro punches using the Neural Network, and to find relational data involving the service life of punches and punching parameters in non-metal blanking processes. The result can be used to estimate optimal clearance between punch and die for industrial applications. Research limitations/implications: In this study, the practical punching processes with different punching conditions were carried out for a set of training data. A trained model exhibited a relationship between service life and clearance of micro punch and die through an abductive network system. The predicted value of wear by abductive network is very close to the actual experimental value, with an error of less than 8 %. This result satisfies the required standard for IC factory production. Originality/value: A good clearance design not only increases the quality of product manufactured, but also reduces product’s burr. As a result, the wear of punches and dies can be greatly reduced and the life expectancy of punching dies increased...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} three decades, {{additive}} manufacturing (AM), {{which is based on}} fashioning 3 D objects through a layer-by-layer construction, has greatly expanded. The progress in this field is due to the capability of fabricating parts with more complexity in the topology and diversity in the array of applicable materials. One such an example is structuring of cellular solids and composite materials appropriate for the vast range of applications. Among different AM methods, powder-bed AM of heterogeneous structures has been utilized to make complex parts. However, the adoption of this process is hindered due to the inability to create closed internal channels that is an essential factor, defining the properties of solids. This inability is mainly related to the de-powdering issue associated with trapped powders inside closed voids. A novel combined approach has been used to attain the design criteria, by selectively encapsulating sacrificial materials within the designated layers during manufacturing and decomposing the substances in post-processing steps. The main objective of this dissertation is to investigate two hypothesized methods for the functional printing of titanium cellular structures with graded pores arranged in a controlled manner. The products in this study were characterized through employing several methods including shrinkage measurements, porosity measurement, mechanical compression test, hardness test, scanning electron microscopy, micro and nano computerized tomography, and X-ray diffraction. The employed methodologies have been classified into two approaches according to the shape of the secondary material embedded into the main substance: 1) crystalline solid particles and 2) liquid resin droplets. For the first approach, a <b>micro-punching</b> system was proposed as a means of positioning the sacrificial particles at designated locations in the AM process. The prototype of the unit was developed and its performance and quality of the products were evaluated. The performance analysis revealed the potential of deploying the method for selective encapsulation of particles from multiple materials and different sizes: (0. 3 ± 0. 0) µm-(0. 5 ± 0. 0) µm. In the second approach, an application of a hybrid AM system integrating binder jetting and material extrusion is investigated to form the graded cellular solids. A proper polymeric sacrificial resin combined bisphenol-A ethoxylated diacrylate and cellulose acetate butyrate was developed to attain the green specimens’ quality and the dimensional accuracy in the morphology of the encapsulated pores. The statistical significance of employing this method was explored on the mechanical and porosity of the titanium structures. Compare to the standard samples (no polymer included), the porosity was increased between 6 % to 16 % depending on the polymer layout in the structures. The stiffness and yield stress measurements suggested a range of 2. 48 ± 0. 37 GPa to 3. 55 ± 0. 49 GPa and 107. 65 ± 18. 14 MPa to 145. 75 ± 13. 85 MPa, respectively. Moreover, the influence of layer thickness and binder saturation level while selectively varied throughout the structure was evaluated to accompany the proposed ideas. Additionally, a novel hybrid AM approach was introduced for developing titanium matrix composites. A highly loaded titanium di-boride ceramic resin was developed and pressure-less sintering protocols were adapted. The quality of the composite with graded periodic reinforcement was determined. Evaluating the data suggested a higher possibility for the formation and growth of titanium boride whisker as the temperature elevated in the heat treatment step (1400 °C). The stiffness of the samples was enhanced significantly by increasing the temperature and volume fraction of reinforcement elements. In particular, those samples sintered up to 1400 °C displayed 6. 4 % to 15. 2 % improvement in the stiffness. The similar improvement trend in the density of the porous matrix was observed (4. 5 %- 19 %). The pore morphology and properties of the Ti structures developed in this thesis are comparable with the size of trabecular separation and properties of the cancellous bones. However, the proposed studies can be deployed in other applications which required the production of lightweight structures...|$|E
40|$|Face gear {{dynamics}} {{is addressed}} by many scholars. However, design solutions of low-noise face gear drives without gear tooth modifications {{are not to}} be constructed. Thus, in this study, a design solution of low-noise face gear drives associated with <b>micro-punch</b> webs is proposed. A calculation procession of geometric parameters of <b>micro-punch</b> webs is constructed, an example case of a <b>micro-punch</b> web for a low-noise face gear drive is calculated, which is based on the proposed calculation procession, and the noise elimination effect of the example case is predicted. Meanwhile, the impacts of geometric parameters of <b>micro-punch</b> webs on sound resonant frequencies are discussed. Furthermore, an experiment of the example case is conducted to check the effect of <b>micro-punch</b> webs on noise reductions and the proposed calculation procession and design solution. The experimental results indicate that the noise reductions of face gear drives can be accomplished by <b>micro-punch</b> webs under the almost same dynamic response conditions, and the fidelity of the proposed calculation procession of geometric parameters of <b>micro-punch</b> webs and design solution of low-noise face gear drives can be accepted. These contributions would improve engineering applications of low-noise face gear drives...|$|R
40|$|A Q-switched Nd-YAG laser {{was used}} to sculpt a WC <b>micro-punch</b> in a {{sintered}} preform. A cylindrical punch was obtained with a nominal diameter of 400 μm and 80 μm in height. Laser machined surface was characterized both qualitatively and quantitatively by means of scanning surface topography instrument. A 20 μm thick aluminum sheet was <b>micro-punched</b> using a testing machine as a drive and a gasket material for support. The gasket followed the <b>micro-punched</b> disk during all the shearing process, collapsing under the punching load. This simple forming process was defined to reduce the micro-part distortion and to avoid the fabrication of a micro-die. Finally, optical microscopy showed that the punched part had a flat surface in the centre and some anomalies at the edges where the punch melted zones were reproduced...|$|R
