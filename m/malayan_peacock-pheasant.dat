50|$|Together {{with the}} phenotypically similar <b>Malayan</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> and -Palawan peacock-pheasant it {{represents}} a basal group in its genus; their radiation probably {{took place during the}} PlioceneBeing very poorly known, the Bornean peacock-pheasant was long considered to be a subspecies of the <b>Malayan</b> <b>peacock-pheasant,</b> but the two species are well-isolated geographically. The highly specialised anterior breast and upper neck plumage of male Bornean peacock-pheasant males are quite distinctive. Females of the two species are more difficult to distinguish. The retrices of the Bornean species are morphologically and patterned intermediate between Palawan and Malayan peacock-pheasants.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Malayan</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> (Polyplectron malacense) {{also known}} as crested peacock-pheasant or Malaysian peacock-pheasant, is a {{medium-sized}} pheasant of the galliform family Phasianidae. The closely related Bornean peacock-pheasant (P. schleiermacheri) was formerly included here as a subspecies, but as understood today, P. malacense is monotypic.|$|E
50|$|The lowland dipterocarp {{forest area}} {{contains}} very high diversity {{of birds and}} mammals especially primates and bats. At Kuala Gandah, is the Elephant Centre {{for the management of}} displaced animals. At Jenderak is the breeding centre for seladang (Bos gaurus). Among the birdlife, the rare <b>Malayan</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> is still found in the reserve in some numbers.|$|E
50|$|Taman Negara {{is home to}} some rare mammals, such as the Malayan tiger, crab-eating macaque, Malayan gaur (seladang) and Indian elephant. As well as birds such as {{the great}} argus, red junglefowl, and the rare <b>Malayan</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> are still found here in some numbers. Tahan River has been {{preserved}} to protect the Malaysian mahseer (ikan kelah in Malay), a type of game fish.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to ongoing}} habitat loss, small {{population}} size and limited range, the <b>Malayan</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> is evaluated as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Its classification is VU A2cd+3 cd+4 cd, meaning that its numbers have declined about two-thirds {{in the last}} decade or so, and that this trend is expected to last for another decade at least. It is listed on CITES Appendix II.|$|E
5000|$|... mtDNA {{cytochrome}} b and D-loop {{as well as}} {{the nuclear}} ovomucoid intron G sequence data places the <b>Malayan</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> within the basal radiation of its genus, together with the even more elusive Bornean peacock-pheasant (P. schleiermacheri) [...] - [...] and Palawan peacock-pheasant (P. napoleonis). The common ancestor of the Malay peacock-pheasants probably diverged from its relatives during the Pliocene or maybe Late Miocene, about 5 million years ago (Ma) perhaps.|$|E
