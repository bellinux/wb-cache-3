50|$|The Domestic Purposes Benefit, or DPB, {{was first}} {{introduced}} in New Zealand in 1973 by the country's 3rd Labour government led by Prime Minister Norman Kirk. The Destitute Persons Act 1910 and the Domestic Proceedings Act 1968 had previously created a statutory means by which a woman could seek a <b>maintenance</b> <b>order</b> against {{the father of her}} children. The court could, at its discretion, set the rate that it thought appropriate for the father to pay the mother in respect of the child. This maintenance continued until the child reached the age of sixteen; maintenance would continue to be payable in respect of a child over the age of sixteen if the child was engaged in full-time education. These statutes provided a means by which women could seek maintenance from the putative father, but in the event of any difficulties, women had to resort to the court in order to enforce the maintenance agreement or order. There were also further difficulties; an unmarried mother had to obtain an acknowledgement of paternity from the father or a declaration of paternity from the court in order to be entitled to seek maintenance. The DPB, introduced in statutory form in 1973, mitigated these difficulties. The Act provided State financial support for single mothers, irrespective of whether the father was contributing to maintenance payments.|$|E

5000|$|Canada {{laws on the}} {{recognition}} of unmarried cohabitation for legal purposes vary significantly by province/territory; {{and in addition to}} this, federal regulations also have an impact across the country. (see Common-law marriage#Canada) Family formation has undergone significant changes in Canada during the last decades of the 20th century, but the patterns vary widely across the country, suggesting differing cultural norms in different regions. Since the mid 1990s, births to cohabiting parents have increased, particularly in Quebec. In Canada, it is difficult to obtain exact data on the percentage of births outside of marriage, {{due to the fact that}} data on the marital status of mothers is collected differently across the provinces and territories of Canada, and in some (such as Alberta) it is not broken down in detail in regard to whether the mother was legally married or not at the birth of her child. As of 2012, the statistical category of [...] "single mothers"(defined as never married at the time of the birth) encompassed 28.3% of mothers, the category [...] "divorced" [...] (i.e. mothers who were unmarried at the time of birth, but had been previously married during their lives) encompassed 1%, while for 10% of mothers the marital status was unknown ("not stated").There are, however, very significant differences by province/territory; for example in 2012, 77.8% of births in Nunavut were listed to [...] "single mothers", by contrast, less than 20% of mothers in Ontario were listed in this category. Latest data from the Quebec Statistical Institute shows that as of 2015, in Quebec, 63% of children were born to unmarried women. In Canada, legal issues regarding cohabitation are very complicated by the fact that family law in this regard differs by province/territory, which is very confusing to the public, especially as this contrasts to criminal law which is the same across Canada, as well as to marriage and divorce law, which is also the same across the country, under the 1986 Divorce Act (Canada) (although provinces/territories have jurisdiction over some marital issues, including the solemnization of marriage, spousal and child support, and property division). The marital status of Canadians also varies by province/territory: in 2011, 46.4% of the population aged 15 and over was legally married; ranging from the lowest percentage of married people being in Nunavut (29.7%), Northwest Territories (35.0%), Quebec (35.4%), and Yukon (37.6%); to highest being in Newfoundland and Labrador (52.9%), Prince Edward Island (51.7%), Ontario (50.3%) and Alberta (50.2%). While today Quebec is known for liberal family formation and cohabitation, this is a recent development: during the first half of the 20th century, family life in the province was conservative and strongly dominated by Roman Catholicism; before 1968, there was no provincial divorce legislation in Quebec, and spouses could only end their marriage if they obtained a private Act of Parliament. One of the explanations of the current high rates of cohabitation in Quebec is that the traditionally strong social control of the church and the Catholic doctrine over people's private relations and sexual morality has led the population to rebel against traditional and conservative social values. While some provinces were early to modernize family law, in others this only happened in the 1990s and the 21st century, such as in Alberta, through the Family Law Act (Alberta) which came into force in 2005. This Act overhauled family legislation, replacing the Domestic Relations Act, the <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Order</b> Act, the Parentage and Maintenance Act, and parts of the Provincial Court Act and the Child, Youth and Family Enhancement Act, which were seen as outdated. Also, the Adult Interdependent Relationships Act (S.A. 2002, c. A-4.5) amended 69 Alberta laws. The Canadian Prairies provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan have strong common-law spouses regulations, imposing rights and obligations on common-law couples. Nova Scotia has also been very slow to advance family law - it was only in 1999 that this province abolished discrimination against [...] "illegitimate" [...] children with regard to inheritance (through section 16 of NS Intestate Succession Act amended in 1999). In general, today, provinces in Western Canada give more rights to common-law spouses than those in Atlantic Canada and in Quebec. This may seem quite paradoxical, because it is the eastern provinces which have the strongest tradition of cohabitation; according to a study [...] "unmarried cohabitation seems to be more common in Eastern Canada than in Western Canada, which might be related to internal and international migration". (as of 2012, 48% of births in New Brunswick, 47.1% in Newfoundland and Labrador, and 45.2% in Nova Scotia, were listed to [...] "single mothers", way above the national average). In British Columbia, the Family Law Act came into force in 2013.|$|E
40|$|When a {{claimant}} obtains {{an order}} from the Court, in particular an order awarding them maintenance, most claimants are {{under the impression that}} it is the court's duty to ensure that the defendant pays.

The study also revealed that the whereabouts of the ex-husband is crucial in determining whether the <b>maintenance</b> <b>order</b> could be enforced because all modes of executing the order would require information of the ex-husband's whereabouts.

40|$|Although the {{principles}} of Revenue Management (RM) have vaguely been used in business for a long time, {{an increasing number of}} organizations are implementing well structured RM systems in the last few decades due to the developments in science and technology, especially in economics, statistics, operations research and computer science. The improvements in information and telecommunication technologies, wide use of Internet, rise of e-commerce and successful supply chain management strategies have enabled organizations to model and solve complex RM problems. This dissertation research concentrates on airlines, the earliest and leading user of RM. Today, airlines face serious financial problems due to the increasing costs and competition. They continuously explore new opportunities especially in terms of RM to make profit and survive. In this study, two problems are analyzed within this scope; airline booking process with adapted options approach and aircraft <b>maintenance</b> <b>order</b> control through RM. First; a new approach, financial options approach, is proposed to sell tickets in airline reservation systems. The options are used to overcome the uncertainty in air travel demand and competitors' actions. The seat inventory control problem is formulated with overbooking and embedded options respectively. Then a simulation study is conducted the potential of using options in airlines booking process. Accordingly, empirical results show that they present an opportunity both to utilize capacity more efficiently and to value seats more precisely compared to overbooking approach. Secondly; a peak load pricing concept is applied for aircraft <b>maintenance</b> <b>order</b> control problem. Aircraft maintenance centers face with peak loads in some seasons and the capacity is underutilized in other seasons. A peak load pricing model is proposed to shift some of the price elastic demand from peak seasons to off-peak seasons to balance demand and supply around the year. A dynamic programming algorithm is developed to solve the model and a code is written in C++. Results show that the model improves both annual capacity loading factors and revenues without causing a discomfort {{from the perspective of the}} customers. The details of both studies are presented in this dissertation research. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT...|$|E

40|$|The Maintenance Act 23 of 1963 {{moved the}} burden of {{maintenance}} enforcement from the then Supreme Courts to maintenance courts The aim of the Act {{was to create a}} procedure by means of which an aggrieved party could obtain and/or enforce a <b>maintenance</b> <b>order</b> quickly and cheaply. Regrettably, the Act, and more specifically its enforcement mechanisms, proved to be ineffective. Complaints about the system ranged from the treatment, attitudes and facilities encountered at maintenance courts by complainants, to the seeming impunity with which maintenance debtors manage to evade their legal duty to maintain their dependents, even where maintenance orders were in force. In response to the problems encountered with the 1963 Maintenance Act and to fulfil South Africa’s international and constitutional obligations, the Maintenance Act 99 of 1998 was introduced. As the bulk of the Maintenance Act would have been in operation for exactly ten years on 26 November 2009, the government thought it appropriate to obtain a ten year review of the Act.

40|$|The formal written laws in Samoa {{include a}} number of statues {{relating}} to family law, including the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Ordinance 1961 and the Maintenance and Affiliation Act 1967. In 2010, both these Acts were amended. The amendments to the divorce legislation made Samoa {{one of the only}} two small Pacific island nations to have introduced a purely no-fault system of divorce, the other being Fiji. Neighbouring countries have either fault-based systems or 2 ̆ 7 mixed 2 ̆ 7 systems, where divorce may be fault-based or based o a no-fault ground. The amendments also introduce a much needed reform which allows the courts to alter property rights. Formerly, the courts had been faced with a choice of denying a remedy to a party whose name was not on the title, or using elaborate devices to supplement the existing law. The changes to the law on maintenance and affiliation give new powers to the District Court to make custody orders and set out guidelines on the amount and payment of maintenance. The court may also require financial information, the execution of necessary instruments to secure payment, and the provision of security for the obedience of a <b>maintenance</b> <b>order</b> The court may also order parties to undergo mediation.
