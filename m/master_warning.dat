60|$|William was {{at first}} {{inclined}} to disbelieve the story which Galet told him, {{and to think that}} there was no cause to fear. He was, however, soon convinced that Galet was right, and that there was reason for alarm. He arose and dressed himself hastily; and, inasmuch as a monarch, in the first moments of the discovery of a treasonable plot, knows not whom to trust, William wisely concluded not to trust any body. He went himself to the stables, saddled his horse with his own hand, mounted him, and rode away. He had a very narrow escape; for, at the same time, while Galet was hastening to Valonges to give his <b>master</b> <b>warning</b> of his danger, the conspirators had been advancing to the same place, and had completely surrounded it; and they were on the eve of making an attack upon William's quarters at the very hour when he set out upon his flight. William had accordingly proceeded only a little way on his route before he heard the footsteps of galloping horses, and the clanking of arms, on the road behind him. It was a troop of the conspirators coming, who, finding that William had fled, had set off immediately in pursuit. William rode hastily into a wood, and let them go by.|$|E

50|$|In 1947 New York, Chief Jack Thompson and Agent Peggy Carter of the SSR {{apprehend}} Soviet spy Dottie Underwood, {{after setting}} her up during an attempted bank robbery. Newly appointed Chief Daniel Sousa of the Los Angeles SSR office meets with Detective Andrew Henry, who has discovered a woman's {{body in a}} frozen lake during a heat wave. Sousa, doubting his inexperienced subordinates, asks Thompson for backup—Carter is sent. An autopsy shows that the body glows in the dark, likely caused by Isodyne Energy's particle accelerator. Carter learns from Isodyne scientist Jason Wilkes that the woman was a physicist there who {{had an affair with}} Isodyne owner and prospective senator Calvin Chadwick. Underwood is taken into FBI custody, with Thompson's mentor Vernon <b>Masters</b> <b>warning</b> him that the SSR will soon be replaced by a new, peace-time organization. Henry attempts to kill Wilkes, but is killed himself by a police officer; Henry and the officer were hired to cover up the murder by Chadwick and his actress wife Whitney Frost following the former's affair.|$|R

50|$|After First Officer Davtyan {{extended}} the flaps to full, few seconds later, the <b>master</b> <b>warning</b> sounded, {{and continued to}} do so {{until the end of}} the recording. The speed at the time was too fast, which could tear the flaps apart and could cause the plane to crash, similar to Austral Lineas Aereas Flight 2553. The plane was banking to the right. Flight 967 began a nose-down attitude and the flaps then retracted to 18°. Captain Grigoryan then made an 11° nose-down input, causing the plane to descend even further.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was scheduled to}} ferry 13 empty cargo pallets to be filled at Jeddah then returned to Kano. The flight was nearly canceled because only five pallets were loaded onto the aircraft, and the employee who had keys to the cargo pallet storage area did not report for work that day. The captain nearly cancelled the flight until arrangements were made for seven more cargo pallets to be added. The aircraft took at approximately 17:00 UTC and arrived in Jeddah a few minutes past 22:00 UTC. The turnaround time would have normally taken {{an hour and a}} half, but it took {{two and a half hours}} since the cargo pallets had to be loaded after arrival in Jeddah. The {{aircraft was}} ready for takeoff at 00:30 UTC, but during the engine start up procedure engine number 4 would not start. Engine number 4 was repaired and the flight took off at 13:48 UTC en route to Kano and was expected at Kano at 18:19 UTC. The captain was not warned about any classified or hazardous material aboard. The flight engineer sensed a strange odor in the cockpit at flight level 35 as the aircraft approached N'Djamena, at about 17:00 UTC. The rest of the crew as well as the ground engineer and the load-master confirmed the smell had persisted for a while. The two passengers traced to odor to pallet 11 and which appeared to be misty. After being handed a fire extinguisher the applied it to the pallet and when they returned they were breathing heavily. Afterwards the smoke evacuation procedure was followed and the smell temporarily ceased. The flight was cleared to descend at 18:00 UTC. Shortly afterwards the <b>master</b> <b>warning</b> followed a minute later by a fire warning sounded. With smoke entering the cabin, the flight went into a descent of nearly 3000 feet per minute. Control of the pitch trims was lost. The flight engineer started a radio transmission to the airline at 1804:57 UTC that ended suddenly at 1805:04, the same time the cockpit voice recordings stopped. The two survivors both reported that the first explosion tripped the autopilot and the aircraft rocked sharply. The aircraft descended slowly in the grasses but rolled upon contact with the water.|$|E
5000|$|After {{studying}} {{the wreckage of}} the Airbus A320-216 as well as the two black boxes and the cockpit recorder, Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee issued a report with their conclusions from the investigation on 1 December 2015. The report stated that the sequence of events that led to the crash started with a malfunction in two of the plane’s rudder travel limiter units (RTLU). A tiny soldered electrical connection in the plane's RTLU was found to be cracked, likely for over a year, causing it to intermittently send amber <b>master</b> caution <b>warnings</b> to the electronic centralised aircraft monitor (ECAM) - with the plane's maintenance records showing that the RTLU warning had been sent 23 times over the previous year, but was always solved (and never further investigated, which could have addressed the underlying electrical problem) by resetting the RTLU system. On this flight, the RTLU issue sent an amber caution warning four different times, and the first three times that the ECAM system gave the warning [...] "Auto Flight Rudder Travel Limiter System", the pilot in command followed the ECAM instructions, toggling the flight augmentation computer (FAC) 1 and 2 buttons on the cockpit's overhead panel to off and then on. This procedure did clear the amber <b>master</b> caution <b>warnings</b> for each of those first three warnings.|$|R

50|$|On 18 May 1896 a major civil {{disturbance}} occurred in Newlyn, {{which was at}} the time a major fishing port. Newlyn was home to a large number of Methodist and Non-Conformist religious groups, some of whom practised a ban on fishing {{on the day of the}} Sabbath. Non-Cornish fisherman, largely from Lowestoft and other English ports, did not hold the same opinions about observing the Sabbath, and so continued to fish on a Sunday, which would attract higher prices for their fish than sold on a weekday. On the morning of the 18th, a group of 40 fishermen bolstered by a mob of roughly a thousand supporters, boarded a number of non-Cornish fishing boats moored in the harbour and destroyed their catches. Police were alerted and arrived on the scene within a few hours, although they numbered only eight, supported by Cornwall County officers Superintendent Richard Nicholas and Inspector Matthews. Out at sea, over 100 Lowestoft vessels were approached by a small steamer piloted by the Newlyn harbour <b>master,</b> <b>warning</b> them of the situation. The harbour master himself was pursued by a local trawler, and by late afternoon a fleet of vessels from Porthleven had arrived in support of the mob. The following morning, police clashed with rioters around Newlyn Harbour, with Inspector Matthews severely injured by a fish box which was thrown at him, cutting his head and breaking his finger. During the chaos, seven “Yorkie” vessels were spotted making for Penzance to land their catches, and over 300 rioters made for Penzance harbour. Police intercepted the group at Penzance, and, backed by a large number of local youths, managed to deter them from attack. By mid afternoon the situation was out of control, and the police called in the military. At 6pm 400 soldiers from the Royal Berkshire Regiment under Major Massard arrived by train at Penzance and took temporary billets in the town, remaining on standby until the police required them. Two hours later, a large riot broke out between Newlyn, Porthleven and St Ives fishermen. Police were beaten back when they tried to intervene, giving them cause to call upon the assistance of the army who had arrived earlier. The police and army joined together and were met with stone-throwing as they crossed the Newlyn Bridge, but were able to occupy the piers long enough to see in the arrival of HMS Ferret. The presence of the military on land and sea was enough to calm the rioters, and by midnight the disturbance was over.|$|E
40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{this gap}} in CAS and intelligent alarm research by examining {{whether or not}} a single <b>master</b> alarm <b>warning</b> versus multiple warnings for the different collision warning systems conveys adequate information to the drivers. Intelligent driver warning systems signaling impending frontal and rear collisions, as well as unintentional lane departures were used in this experiment, and all the warnings were presented to drivers through the auditory channel only. We investigated two critical research questions in this study: 1. Do multiple intelligent alarms as opposed to a single master alarm affect drivers’ recognition, performance, and action when they experience a likely imminent collision and unintentional lane departure? 2. Is driver performance and overall situation awareness under the two different alarm alerting schemes affected by reliabilities of the warning systems?Prepared For Ford Motor Compan...|$|R

60|$|But {{you must}} not imagine because I have spoken of people praying {{through the night and}} people going aboard ships and people fleeing toward mountainous country that the whole world was already in a terror because of the star. As a matter of fact, use and wont still ruled the world, and save for the talk of idle moments and the splendour of the night, nine human beings out of ten were still busy at their common occupations. In all the cities the shops, save one here and there, opened and closed at their proper hours, the doctor and the {{undertaker}} plied their trades, the workers gathered in the factories, soldiers drilled, scholars studied, lovers sought one another, thieves lurked and fled, politicians planned their schemes. The presses of the newspapers roared through the night, and many a priest of this church and that would not open his holy building to further what he considered a foolish panic. The newspapers insisted on the lesson of the year 1000--for then, too, people had anticipated the end. The star was no star--mere gas--a comet; and were it a star it could not possibly strike the earth. There was no precedent for such a thing. Common sense was sturdy everywhere, scornful, jesting, a little inclined to persecute the obdurate fearful. That night, at seven-fifteen by Greenwich time, the star would be at its nearest to Jupiter. Then the world would see the turn things would take. The <b>master</b> mathematician's grim <b>warnings</b> were treated by many as so much mere elaborate self-advertisement. Common sense at last, a little heated by argument, signified its unalterable convictions by going to bed. So, too, barbarism and savagery, already tired of the novelty, went about their nightly business, and save for a howling dog here and there, the beast world left the star unheeded.|$|R
