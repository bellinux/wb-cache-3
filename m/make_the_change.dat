5|$|In 1999, MDOT {{petitioned the}} American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials to {{decommission}} the US27 designation in the state; {{the change was}} approved on April 16, 1999. The state waited until 2002 to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>change.</b> After the change was implemented, Bus. US27 was renumbered to Bus. US127 as {{with all of the}} other similar business routes in the state. However, unlike the other new Bus. US127s, this one had no connection to US127, its new parent highway. MDOT has retained the business route as an unsigned trunkline designation ever since.|$|E
5|$|In the episode's {{original}} plot, {{the bank}} robber {{was to have}} jumped into Mulder's body. There was, however, a belief {{at the time that}} neither Scully nor Mulder should directly experience such phenomena. After Fox and the studio argued against the idea of using Mulder in such a way, the producers agreed to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>change.</b> The opening bank robbery scene was filmed on location in Vancouver, where Jason Schombing's acting led some bystanders to believe that robbery was a real one.|$|E

5|$|An {{expressway}} through Clare County {{opened in}} late 1961, and US27 was rerouted to follow it, bypassing Harrison to the east. The former route of US27 along M-61 and 1st Street/Clare Avenue in Harrison was designated Bus. US27 at this time. In 1999, MDOT petitioned AASHTO to decommission the US27 designation in the state; {{the change was}} approved on April 16, 1999.

5|$|The {{system of}} pre-defining the {{indicator}} {{setting for the}} day for all Enigma operators on a given network, on which the method of characteristics depended, was changed on 15 September 1938. The one exception to this was the network used by the Sicherheitsdienst (SD)—the intelligence agency of the SS and the Nazi Party—who did not <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> until 1 July 1939. Operators now chose their own indicator setting. However, the insecure procedure of sending the enciphered message key twice, remained in use, and it was quickly exploited. Henryk Zygalski devised a manual method that used 26 perforated sheets, and Marian Rejewski commissioned the AVA company to produce the bomba kryptologiczna (cryptologic bomb).|$|E
5|$|An {{expressway}} through Isabella and Clare counties {{opened in}} late 1961, and US27 was rerouted to follow it, bypassing Clare to the east. The former route of US27 along McEwan Street and Clare Avenue was designated Bus. US27 at this time. A freeway bypass north of Clare and Farwell opened in 1975, and US10 was rerouted along the US27 freeway to connect {{from the new}} bypass to the existing freeway east of the city, bypassing both cities. The section of US10 in downtown Clare was designated Bus. US10 at this time, running along Bus. US27 to connect to US27/US10 north of downtown.

5|$|In 1963, the Michigan State Highway Department petitioned AASHO {{to again}} <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> it had {{requested}} back in 1958, moving I-96 over I-196 to end at Muskegon and renumbering I-96 west of Grand Rapids to I-67. The state cited problems with destination signing and numerous complaints {{from the public}} about confusion caused by the numbering. At their October 21, 1963 meeting, AASHO approved the relocation of I-96, but rejected I-67, stating that the number should be kept for a more major route in case the system is expanded, and instead assigned I-196 to the not-yet-complete Benton Harbor–Grand Rapids highway. The signage was switched in January 1964. With the scheduled completion of the Lodge Freeway on October 29, 1964, a full freeway route was available from I-96 into downtown Detroit via I-696 and the Lodge, {{but it would be}} some time before I-96 was finished into the city.|$|E

This sparked a debate {{as to how the}} notwithstanding clause can be amended. Some argued that the amending formula required the federal government to gain the approval of at least seven provinces with at least half the national population (the standard procedure). Others argued that since the proposal would only limit the Federal Parliament's powers, Parliament could <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> alone.|$|E
25|$|By 1982, pornographic film {{production}} had {{switched to the}} cheaper and more convenient medium of video tape. Many film directors were hesitant to switch because of the different image quality that video tape produced. Those who did <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> benefited from greater profits since consumers preferred the new format. This change moved the films out of the theaters and into people's private homes. This {{was the end of}} the age of big budget productions and the beginning of the mainstreaming of pornography. It soon went back to its earthy roots and expanded to cover every fetish possible since video production was inexpensive. Instead of hundreds of pornographic films being made each year, thousands of videos were including compilations of just the sex scenes from various titles.|$|E
