25|$|Enteroclysis {{also called}} small bowel enema is a Barium X-ray {{examination}} used to display individual loops {{of the small}} intestine by intubating the jejunum with a small tube and administering Barium sulfate followed by <b>methylcellulose</b> or air.|$|E
25|$|For {{small bowel}} examinations, in {{addition}} to fasting for 8 hours prior to examination, a laxative may also be necessary for bowel preparation and cleansing. Enteroclysis involves the continued infusion of 500 to 1000mL of thin barium sulfate suspension into the intestine through a duodenal tube. Then <b>methylcellulose</b> is instilled through the tube. Barium and <b>methylcellulose</b> fill the intestinal loops which can be viewed continuously using fluoroscopy, or viewed as standard radiographs taken at frequent intervals. The technique is a double-contrast procedure that allows detailed imaging of the entire small intestine. However, the procedure may take 6 hours or longer to complete and is quite uncomfortable to undergo.|$|E
25|$|Viscous fibers thicken the {{contents}} of the intestinal tract and may attenuate the absorption of sugar, reduce sugar response after eating, and reduce lipid absorption (notably shown with cholesterol absorption). Their use in food formulations is often limited to low levels, due to their viscosity and thickening effects. Some viscous fibers may also be partially or fully fermented within the intestinal tract (guar gum, beta-glucan, glucomannan and pectins), but some viscous fibers are minimally or not fermented (modified cellulose such as <b>methylcellulose</b> and psyllium).|$|E
25|$|<b>Methylcellulose</b> (MC) is a {{material}} with well-defined sol-gel transitions in the optimal range of temperatures. MC gelation occurs {{because of an}} increase in intra- and inter-molecular hydrophobic interactions as the temperature increases. The sol-gel transition is governed by the lower critical solution temperature (LCST), which is the temperature at which the elastic modulus equals the viscous modulus. The LCST must not exceed physiological temperature (37Â°C) if the scaffold is to gel upon implantation, creating a minimally invasive delivery. Following implantation into a TBI lesion cavity or peripheral nerve guidance conduit, MC elicits a minimal inflammatory response. It is also very important for minimally invasive delivery that the MC solution has a viscosity at temperatures below its LCST, which allows it to be injected through a small gauge needle for implantation in in vivo applications. MC has been successfully used as a delivery agent for intra-optical and oral pharmaceutical therapies. Some disadvantages of MC include its limited propensity for protein adsorption and neuronal cellular adhesion making it a non-bioactive hydrogel. Due to these disadvantages, use of MC in neural tissue regeneration requires attaching a biologically active group onto the polymer backbone in order to enhance cell adhesion.|$|E

50|$|Vcaps {{capsules}} are a two-piece capsule made of hydroxypropyl <b>methylcellulose,</b> a cellulose-based raw material. They {{were designed}} to meet restrictive dietary needs, and are thus gluten-free, vegan, kosher, and halaal.|$|E
50|$|A {{special grade}} of {{bleached}} sulfite pulp {{is known as}} dissolving pulp which is the raw material {{for a wide variety}} of cellulose derivatives, for example rayon, cellophane, cellulose acetate and <b>methylcellulose.</b>|$|E
50|$|Demulcents are {{sometimes}} referred to as mucoprotective agents. Demulcents such as pectin, glycerin, honey, and syrup are common ingredients in cough mixtures and cough drops. <b>Methylcellulose,</b> propylene glycol and glycerine are synthetic demulcents.|$|E
50|$|The active {{ingredients}} in Obocell were the stimulant amphetamine phosphate (5 mg), and the anti-histamine methapyrilene (25 mg). Nicel, which was Irwin, Neisler's brand of high-viscosity <b>methylcellulose,</b> was also {{listed on the}} main packaging.|$|E
50|$|Licaps {{capsules}} are two-piece gelatin or hydroxypropyl <b>methylcellulose</b> capsules {{designed specifically}} for containing liquids or semi-solids. Licaps can be used when drugs' ingredients are more stable as a liquid, such as in dietary supplements.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{scientists}} {{conducting research}} {{in the fields of}} immunology (including auto-immune disorders), infectious disease, hematological malignancies, vaccine development, transplant immunology, and high-throughput screening are frequent users of PBMCs. In many cases, PBMCs are derived from blood banks. PBMC fraction also contains progenitor populations, as demonstrated by <b>methylcellulose</b> based colony forming assays.|$|E
50|$|Preparations contain {{carboxymethyl}} cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, hydroxypropyl <b>methylcellulose</b> (a.k.a. HPMC or hypromellose), {{hydroxypropyl cellulose}} and hyaluronic acid (a.k.a. hyaluronan, HA) They contain water, salts and polymers but lack the proteins found in natural tears. Patients who use them {{more frequently than}} once every three hours should choose a brand without preservatives or one with non-irritating preservatives.|$|E
50|$|The makeup for Evil Ed's wolf {{transformation}} took 18 hours. While he had {{the wolf}} head on, the crew began pouring {{what they thought was}} <b>Methylcellulose</b> into his mouth to create the illusion of saliva, but when Geoffreys began to complain about the taste, Mark Bryan Wilson realized they'd been using prosthetic adhesive, which was gluing his mouth shut.|$|E
50|$|Artisan papers such as unryu, lokta, hanji, gampi, kozo, saa, and abaca {{have long}} fibers {{and are often}} {{extremely}} strong. As these papers are floppy to start with, they are often backcoated or resized with <b>methylcellulose</b> or wheat paste before folding. Also, these papers are extremely thin and compressible, allowing for thin, narrowed limbs {{as in the case}} of insect models.|$|E
50|$|Tablet {{coatings}} protect tablet ingredients from deterioration by {{moisture in}} the air and make large or unpleasant-tasting tablets easier to swallow. For most coated tablets, a cellulose ether hydroxypropyl <b>methylcellulose</b> (HPMC) film coating is used which is free of sugar and potential allergens. Occasionally, other coating materials are used, for example synthetic polymers, shellac, corn protein zein or other polysaccharides. Capsules are coated with gelatin.|$|E
50|$|Some APIs may be tableted as pure substances, {{but this}} is rarely the case; most {{formulations}} include excipients. Normally, a pharmacologically inactive ingredient (excipient) termed a binder is added to help hold the tablet together and give it strength. A wide variety of binders may be used, some common ones including lactose, dibasic calcium phosphate, sucrose, corn (maize) starch, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone polyvinylpyrrolidone and modified cellulose (for example hydroxypropyl <b>methylcellulose</b> and hydroxyethylcellulose).|$|E
50|$|Bleached {{kraft pulp}} and {{bleached}} sulfite pulp {{are used to}} make high quality, white printing paper. One of the most visible uses for unbleached kraft pulp is to make brown paper shopping bags and wrapping paper where strength is particularly important. A special grade of bleached sulfite pulp, known as dissolving pulp, is used to make cellulose derivatives such as <b>methylcellulose</b> which are used {{in a wide range}} of everyday products from laxatives to baked goods to wallpaper paste.|$|E
50|$|Methyl {{cellulose}} (or <b>methylcellulose)</b> is {{a chemical}} compound derived from cellulose. It is a hydrophilic white powder in pure form and dissolves in cold (but not in hot) water, forming a clear viscous solution or gel. It is sold under {{a variety of}} trade names and is used as a thickener and emulsifier in various food and cosmetic products, and also as a treatment of constipation. Like cellulose, it is not digestible, not toxic, and not an allergen.|$|E

Their use in food formulations is often limited to low levels, due to their viscosity and thickening effects. Some viscous fibers may also be partially or fully fermented within the intestinal tract (guar gum, beta-glucan, glucomannan and pectins), but some viscous fibers are minimally or not fermented (modified cellulose such as <b>methylcellulose</b> and psyllium).|$|E
5000|$|Petroleum jelly is {{commonly}} used as a personal lubricant {{because it does not}} dry out like water-based lubricants, and has a distinctive [...] "feel", different from that of K-Y and related <b>methylcellulose</b> products. However, it is not recommended for use with condoms during sexual activity because it swells latex and thus increases the chance of rupture. It is also not recommended for vaginal intercourse because it may increase the risk of yeast infection and bacterial vaginosis in women. It may be used safely for anal intercourse.|$|E
5000|$|Tear replacers are a {{mainstay}} of treatment, preferably containing <b>methylcellulose</b> or carboxymethyl cellulose. [...] Ciclosporin stimulates tear production and acts as a suppressant on the immune-mediated processes that cause the disease. Topical antibiotics and corticosteroids are sometimes used to treat secondary infections and inflammation. A surgery known as parotid duct transposition is used in some extreme cases where medical treatment has not helped. This redirects the duct from the parotid salivary gland to the eye. Saliva replaces the tears. Dogs suffering from cherry eye should have the condition corrected to help prevent this disease.|$|E
5000|$|Gluten-free breads {{have been}} created [...] for people {{affected}} by gluten-related disorders such as coeliac disease and non-coeliac gluten sensitivity, who may benefit from a gluten-free diet. Gluten-free bread is made with ground flours {{from a variety of}} materials such as almonds, rice, sorghum, corn, or legumes such as beans, but since these flours lack gluten they may not hold their shape as they rise and their crumb may be dense with little aeration. Additives such as xanthan gum, guar gum, hydroxypropyl <b>methylcellulose</b> (HPMC), corn starch, or eggs are used to compensate for the lack of gluten.|$|E
50|$|Psyllium fiber {{has been}} shown in studies to lower blood {{cholesterol}} and glucose levels while another common fiber, <b>methylcellulose,</b> has not shown these benefits. The use of soluble-fiber cereals is an effective and well-tolerated part of a prudent diet for the treatment of mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia. Although the cholesterol-reducing and glycemic-response properties of psyllium-containing foods are fairly well documented, the effect of long-term inclusion of psyllium in the diet has not been determined. Supplementation with fiber as ispaghula husk may have adverse effects on colorectal adenoma recurrence, especially in patients with high dietary calcium intake.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sequence}} in which Dalton as the Inhuman Hive, possessing Grant Ward, is naked {{and covered in}} goo, was inspired by images of people covered in honey that reminded the showrunners of a birth. Dalton was given two weeks notice {{to prepare for the}} scene, particularly to get in the best shape he could. The goo used was made from <b>methylcellulose,</b> and [...] "they had vats of it and they had different viscosity for different ones, so there were three ones. There was one that was really slippery, one that was kind of thick," [...] Dalton explained.|$|E
50|$|Historic {{forms of}} {{marbling}} used both organic and inorganic pigments mixed with water for colors, and sizes were traditionally made from gum tragacanth (Astragalus spp.), gum karaya, guar gum, fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum), fleabane, linseed, and psyllium. Since the late 19th century, a boiled extract of the carrageenan-rich alga known as Irish moss (Chondrus crispus), has been employed for sizing. Today, many marblers use powdered carrageenan extracted from various seaweeds. Another plant-derived mucilage {{is made from}} sodium alginate. In recent years, a synthetic size made from hydroxypropyl <b>methylcellulose,</b> a common ingredient in instant wallpaper paste, is often used as a size for floating acrylic and oil paints.|$|E
