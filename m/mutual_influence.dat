5|$|There {{are more}} than 30 monuments in the early Maya style, which dates to the Late Preclassic, making it the most common style {{represented}} at Takalik Abaj. The great quantity of early Maya sculpture {{and the presence of}} early examples of Maya hieroglyphic writing suggest that the site played an important part in the development of Maya ideology. The origins of the Maya sculptural style may have developed in the Preclassic on the Pacific coast and Takalik Abaj's position at the nexus of key trade routes could have been important in the dissemination of the style across the Maya area. The early Maya style of monument at Takalik Abaj is closely linked to the style of monument at Kaminaljuyu, showing <b>mutual</b> <b>influence.</b> This interlinked style spread to other sites that formed part of the extended trade network of which these two cities were the twin foci.|$|E

25|$|The date of {{composition}} {{for both the}} Ganesha Purana and the Mudgala Purana, and their dating relative to one another, has {{been a matter of}} academic debate.

Despite this closeness to other Slavic varieties, significant variation exists among Slovak dialects. In particular, eastern varieties differ significantly from the standard language, which is based on central and western varieties.|$|E
25|$|In the reigns of {{succeeding}} kings, the Taungoo Dynasty became increasingly volatile and was overthrown by the Mon. In the mid-18th century, King Alaungpaya defeated the Mon, expanded the Bamar kingdoms, and established the Konbaung Dynasty. Under {{the rule of}} Bodawpaya, a son of Alaungpaya, a unified sect of monks ("Thudhamma") was created within the kingdom. Bodawpaya restored ties with Sri Lanka, allowing for <b>mutual</b> <b>influence</b> in religious affairs.

25|$|As the two alphabets {{were used}} {{alongside}} each other, {{there was a}} <b>mutual</b> <b>influence.</b> The Latin alphabet early borrowed the þ rune to represent the /θ/ and /ð/ phonemes, but in Denmark it was rarely used. In the 15th century, Norwegians and Swedes also stopped using the þ letter, but the Icelanders still retain it in their Latin alphabet. Due to the Latin alphabet the m and the l runes changed places so the rune row read fuþorkniastblmy (note that the last rune had come to represent the /y/ phoneme). In addition, Scandinavians began to double spell runes for consonants, influenced by this use in the Latin alphabet.|$|E

25|$|In the 18th {{century the}} estate was {{inherited}} by Dénes Bánffy (IV), who, {{after a time}} spent in the Viennese Court of Empress Maria Theresa, returned home in 1747 and started a reconstruction of the castle in Austrian Baroque style. Between 1747 and 1751 a Cour d'honneur in U shape was built to {{the eastern side of the}} Renaissance building, which contained: the riding school, the stable, the carriage rooms and servants' quarters. An important achievement was the castle's park near the Szamos River, with walkways, statues and fountains. In the integrative concept specific to Baroque art, the residence and the environment were in a relationship of close interdependence and <b>mutual</b> <b>influence.</b> Based on this concept, the park of 70 ha was set up after the design of architect Johann Christian Erras, which transposed into this space forms dominated by a strict geometry. The sculptor Johann Nachtigall made grandiose stone statues inspired by the ancient poet Ovid.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} into a wealthy family in St. Louis, Missouri, {{grandson}} of the inventor and founder of the Burroughs Corporation, William Seward Burroughs I, and nephew of public relations manager Ivy Lee. Burroughs began writing essays and journals in early adolescence, but did not begin publicizing his writing until his thirties. He left home in 1932 to attend Harvard University, studied English, and anthropology as a postgraduate, and later attended medical school in Vienna. In 1942 Burroughs enlisted in the U.S. Army to serve during World War II, but was turned down by the Office of Strategic Services and Navy, after which he picked up the drug addiction that affected him {{for the rest of his}} life, while working a variety of jobs. In 1943, while living in New York City, he befriended Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, and out of their <b>mutual</b> <b>influence</b> grew the foundation of the Beat Generation, which was later a defining influence on the 1960s counterculture.|$|E
25|$|Regarding the {{relative}} motion and the <b>mutual</b> <b>influence</b> {{of matter and}} aether, there were two controversial theories. One was developed by Fresnel (and subsequently Lorentz). This model (Stationary Aether Theory) supposed that light propagates as a transverse wave and aether is partially dragged with a certain coefficient by matter. Based on this assumption, Fresnel was able to explain the aberration of light and many optical phenomena.The other hypothesis was proposed by George Gabriel Stokes, who stated in 1845 that the aether was fully dragged by matter (later this view was also shared by Hertz). In this model the aether might be (by analogy with pine pitch) rigid for fast objects and fluid for slower objects. Thus the Earth could move through it fairly freely, {{but it would be}} rigid enough to transport light. Fresnel's theory was preferred because his dragging coefficient was confirmed by the Fizeau experiment in 1851, who measured the speed of light in moving liquids.|$|E

30|$|In {{previous}} DTPB model studies, {{structural equation}} modeling was {{used to analyze the}} relationships between variables (Shih and Fang 2004; Lin 2007; Malek et al. 2010). However, accurate analysis was difficult because incorrect conclusions were often caused by some variables that did not satisfy the assumption of independence. To solve this, Lee et al. (2013) employed the expert-opinion-oriented DEMATEL to reestablish the causal relationships between DTPB variables and their <b>mutual</b> <b>influences.</b> Despite the efforts to reestablish the causal relationships between DTPB variables and their <b>mutual</b> <b>influences</b> using the DEMATEL method, this method was dependent on expert opinions regarding the degrees of influence between elements. In particular, a clear definition of threshold value was still missing in the DEMATEL method.|$|R
