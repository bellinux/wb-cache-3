The regular lattice consists of a series of small achromatic bends forming the arcs. The <b>wiggler</b> <b>magnets</b> are placed in low-p regions in the center of insertions separating these arcs. The arrangement minimizes the electron emittances and yields high source brightness.

We propose a compact permanent <b>magnet</b> <b>wiggler</b> which will be installed in the straight sections of the damping ring. The concept discusses the magnetic design and field distribution; a damping integral I D ~ 1. 37 T m per meter wiggler is reached which would correspond to a 475 m long device. Other aspects like characteristics of the synchrotron radiation power or possible radiation damage of the magnets are worked out to an extent that allows comparison to an alternative electromagnetic version of the damping wiggler which is investigated in parallel.

40|$|At BESSY II photon {{energies}} above 2 keV can {{be produced}} only with a permanent <b>magnet</b> <b>wiggler,</b> with superconducting wavelength shifters and with a superconducting wiggler. The wiggler brilliance suffers from the depth of field effect and the wavelength shifters produce the X rays only from a single pole. For the generation of brilliant radiation above 2 keV a small period cryogenic undulator has to be used. This paper discusses the machine requirements for the operation of small gap cryogenic devices at BESSY II. A scheme with two adjacent vertical low beta sections inside {{of one of the}} long straight sections is suggested. The straight is divided into two parts by a quadrupole triplet in the center.

40|$|Synchrotron {{radiation}} {{is a very}} bright, broadband, polarized, pulsed source of electromagnetic radiation extending from the infrared to the x-ray region. Brightness, defined as flux per unit area per unit solid angle, is normally a more important quantity than flux or intensity, particularly in throughput limited applications which include those in which monochromators are used. The authors have attempted to compile the formulae needed to calculate the flux, brightness, polarization and power produced by the three standard storage ring synchrotron radiation sources: bending <b>magnets,</b> <b>wigglers</b> and undulators. Where necessary, these formulae have contained reference to the emittance of the electron beam, {{as well as to}} the electron beam size and its divergence. For all three type sources, the source phase space area, i. e. the spatial and angular extent of the effective (real) source, is a convolution of its electron and photon components...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{intensity}} of X-ray sources has increased {{at a rapid}} rate since the late 1960 s by 10 orders of magnitude and more {{through the use of}} synchrotron radiation produced by bending <b>magnets,</b> <b>wigglers</b> and undulators. Three generations of radiation sources have been identified depending on amplitude and quality of the radiation provided. While user facilities of the third generation were being constructed a new concept of radiation generating devices was being developed that offers an even larger increase in peak and average brightness than had been achieved till then. The new concept of the X-ray Free Electron Laser based on the principle of Self-Amplified Spontaneous Emission will be the basis of fourth generation X-ray source user facilities of this century. The paper will start with a brief history of the development of x-ray sources, discuss some of the differences between storage ring and free electron laser based approaches, and close with an update of the present development of x-ray free electron laser user facilities.

40|$|Interest in <b>Wiggler</b> <b>magnets</b> (a close {{sequence}} of transverse fields with alternating polarity) to extend {{and enhance the}} spectrum of synchrotron radiation from electron storage rings has increased significantly {{during the past few}} years. In this paper we consider standard wigglers i. e. wigglers in which interference effects on the spectrum of synchrotron radiation are not important. In standard wigglers the spectrum of synchrotron radiation has the same general shape as the spectrum from ring bending magnets. How-ever, the critical energy of the wiggler spectrum may be different. The critical energy of the wiggler spectrum is given by BW kw = 'CB T where ECB is the critical energy from the bending magnets and BWandBB are the magnetic field strengths of the <b>wiggler</b> <b>magnet</b> and bending magnets respectively. Since most electron storage rings operate with relatively low bending magnet fields (BB < 12 KG), even a modest <b>wiggler</b> <b>magnet</b> field (5 18 KG) can significantly increase the critical energy. Such magnets are planned for ADONE and SPEAR. Higher field (30 - 50 KG) superconducting mag-nets are planned at Brookhaven, Daresbury, and Novosibirsk to produce even larger increase in the critical energy. For some standard wigglers a further enhancement of the spectrum is produced due to the superposition of the radiation from the individual poles. Wiggler designs are discussed as well as the effect of wigglers on the synchrotron radiation spectrum and on the operation of storage rings...|$|R

40|$|The {{injection}} efficiency of an ILC damping ring is {{closely tied to}} its acceptance.

Tracking studies were done for all proposed ILC damping ring lattices to determine their required physical apertures. Although a half-aperture of 8 or 10 mm had been proposed, our studies showed that, for most lattices, a 16 mm half-aperture is required. (For some lattices a 12 mm half aperture might suffice.)
