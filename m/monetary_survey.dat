40|$|Monetary {{policy in}} the euro area is {{conducted}} within a multicountry, multicultural, and multilingual context involving multiple central banking traditions. How does this heterogeneity affect the ability of economic agents to understand and to anticipate monetary policy by the European Central Bank (ECB) ? Using a database of surveys of professional ECB policy forecasters in 24 countries, we find remarkable differences in forecast accuracy, and {{show that they are}} partly related to geography and clustering around informational hubs, as well as to country-specific economic conditions and traditions of independent central banking in the past. In large part, this heterogeneity can be traced to differences in forecasting models.

We use a panel data set of 26 countries -including 14 inflation targeters- with monthly information from the last 16 years. We find that the dispersion of long-run inflation expectations is lower in targeting regimes after controlling for country-specific effects, time-specific effects, initial dispersion, the level and the variance of inflation, disinflation periods, and global inflation. When we differentiate between developed and developing countries, we find different dynamics for each group. In particular, the mentioned effect of inflation targeting seems to be present only on the developing countries. <b>Monetary</b> Policy, <b>Survey</b> Data, Panel Data...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the usefulness}} of direct measures of consumers' perceptions and expectations of inflation for monetary policy and investigates {{the degree to which}} these variables are anchored. We inter alia seek to xplore whether there is a difference in reaction of consumers in countries with more credible central banks and those from countries with less credible central banks. We moreover investigate whether the introduction of euro coins and banknotes in 2002, that can be interpreted as a structural shock, has significantly affected the inflation rate as perceived by consumers. We find that European inflation expectations are relatively robust to sudden changes in inflation or monetary policy surprises, regardless of the credibility of the central bank. The introduction of the euro, however, significantly affected the inflation perception of European consumers. Inflation expectations; <b>Monetary</b> policy; <b>Survey</b> data...|$|R

40|$|We use {{evidence}} from the term structure of inflation expectations implicit in the nominal yields and survey forecasts of inflation {{to address the question}} of whether or not monetary policy is effective. We construct a model that accommodates forecasts over multiple horizons from multiple surveys and Treasury yields by allowing for differences between risk-neutral, subjective, and objective probability measures. We extract private sector expectations of inflation from this model and establish that they are driven by inflation, real activity and one latent factor, which is correlated with survey forecasts. We show that the interest rate responds to this "survey" factor. The inflation premium and out-of-sample estimates of the inflation long-run mean and persistence suggest that monetary policy became effective over time. As an implication, our model outperforms a standard macro-finance model in inflation and yield forecasting. inflation; macro-finance term structure model; <b>monetary</b> policy; <b>survey</b> forecasts...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} the Federal Reserve and private forecasts {{of growth in}} both business and residential investment for 1983 - 2004 and reaches four main conclusions: First, {{in support of the}} asymmetric information hypothesis, the shorter (longer) horizon Federal Reserve forecasts of growth in business (residential) investment contain useful predictive information beyond that included in private forecasts. Second, the Federal Reserve forecasts are all biased. The same is true for the private forecasts of growth in residential (but not entirely for the forecasts of growth in business) investment. Third, the private forecasts overall do better than those of the Federal Reserve in outperforming the univariate forecasts. Fourth, the Federal Reserve and private forecasts of growth in business (residential) investment, while directionally accurate, imply symmetric (asymmetric) loss. We conclude this study by discussing the usefulness of these forecasts.

40|$|Inflation {{expectations}} play {{an important}} role in shaping the inflation consequences of economic activity. Hence, they are of special importance for <b>monetary</b> policy. <b>Survey</b> measures of inflation expectations are available, but whether they are a good representation of true beliefs is a moot point. Survey measures of inflation expectations often do not track well with realised inflation rates, sometimes producing large forecast errors. Indeed, survey measures of inflation expectations often tend to track better with current or past inflation than with future inflation, raising questions as to their usefulness as proxies for true expectations. This article examines the relationship between surveyed inflation expectations and inflation in New Zealand since inflation stabilised in the early 1990 s. It turns out that while survey data may be inaccurate predictors of the level of inflation, they can still provide useful directional information regarding near-term inflationary pressures. Survey data can be used to supplement other economic indicators, giving a better indication of future inflation. ...|$|R
