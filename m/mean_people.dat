500|$|Writer and supervising {{producer}} Brad Kern {{reflected on}} the show's cancellation, saying, [...] "Ten years later, everybody you talk to... they all love the show. I {{think that was the}} biggest disappointment about the show not coming back. We knew we were doing something special." [...] Told of the show's success in the TV Guide [...] "Save Our Shows" [...] poll, Sandy Grushow said, [...] "Obviously I'm happy and not entirely surprised", but added, [...] "You can't dismiss a season's worth of ratings." [...] Kim Manners, director on {{nearly a third of the}} Brisco episodes, said working on the series gave him an opportunity to grow creatively. He told writer Joe Nazzaro, [...] "It really woke me up as a director, almost spiritually", and that directing for Brisco was a large contributing factor to his success as a regular director on The X-Files. Manners said, [...] "When they didn't give it a second year, I was devastated", adding that he wished Cuse would have made a feature film based on Brisco. Considering the show's short life, Cuse later commented, [...] "If the show could have survived into a second season, I think it could have ended up running for actually a long time. Some shows just sort of fall through the cracks in the right away and they kind of stay on the air long enough to aggregate an audience. I think if circumstances had been different, Brisco could have had a much longer life." [...] Cuse also said the Friday night time slot hurt Briscos chances of building an audience, saying, [...] "We were on at 8 p.m. on Friday night, which is sort of a death slot– I <b>mean</b> <b>people</b> do still go bowling– few shows have succeeded in that slot." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{corollary}} of {{this argument}} is that the privileges enjoyed by intellectuals make them more ideologised and obedient {{than the rest of}} society: [...] "If by 'intellectual' you <b>mean</b> <b>people</b> who are a special class who {{are in the business of}} imposing thoughts, and framing ideas for people in power, and telling everyone what they should believe, and so on, well, yeah, that's different. These people are called 'intellectuals'—but they're really more a kind of secular priesthood, whose task is to uphold the doctrinal truths of the society. And the population should be anti-intellectual in that respect, I think that's a healthy reaction" [...] (ibid, p.96; this statement continues the previous quotation).|$|E

[...] He has also acknowledged other influences. During a 2011 interview on The Charlie Rose Show, Rose asked, [...] "The guiding light has always been Henry James?" [...] and Banville replied, [...] "I think so, I <b>mean</b> <b>people</b> say, you know, I've been influenced by Beckett or Nabokov but it's always been Henry James [...] so I would follow him, I would be a Jamesian." ...|$|E
2500|$|In another Jewish Daily Forward essay, [...] "Life Among the Goyim," [...] Heinze {{looks at}} the British comedian, Sacha Baron Cohen, and his TV comedy, Da Ali G Show, whose title {{character}} is a parody of a [...] "white wannabe-gangsta rapper who not only adopts all the appropriate clothes, gestures and locutions but also convinces himself that he is black." [...] In his essay, Heinze points out that Baron Cohen is a Jew who speaks Hebrew and keeps kosher; and his undergraduate history thesis at Cambridge University was on black-Jewish relations. Yet, Heinze wonders, is there anything about his comedy that is specifically Jewish? For Heinze, the answer is yes, and he arrives at the [...] "yes" [...] in the following whimsical way: [...] "If we take 'goyim' loosely to <b>mean</b> <b>people</b> who are strange, often affable, and potentially dangerous, then, yes, 'Da Ali G Show' is Jewish comedy and we, in our digital phantasmagoria of a world, are all goyim, all on camera, all the time." ...|$|E

[...] said Phil Van Aver, a member of Manhattan Community Board 3. Board 3 and the nonprofit social service organizations supported the goal of clearing Tompkins Square Park of the drug dealers, drunks, addicts and anti-social elements that considered it home. [...] Instead, the police riot ripped open old wounds about brutality and the neighborhood's housing problem many longtime residents faced.

2500|$|According to statute, Qing {{society was}} divided into {{relatively}} closed estates, of which in most general terms there were five. Apart from the estates of the officials, the comparatively minuscule aristocracy, and the degree-holding literati, there also existed a major division among ordinary Chinese between commoners and people with inferior status. They {{were divided into two}} categories: one of them, the good [...] "commoner" [...] people, the other [...] "mean" [...] people. The majority of the population belonged to the first category and were described as liangmin, a legal term meaning good people, as opposed to jianmin meaning the mean (or ignoble) people. Qing law explicitly stated that the traditional four occupational groups of scholars, farmers, artisans and merchants were [...] "good", or having a status of commoners. On the other hand, slaves or bondservants, entertainers (including prostitutes and actors), and those low-level employees of government officials were the [...] "mean people". <b>Mean</b> <b>people</b> were considered legally inferior to commoners and suffered unequal treatments, forbidden to take the imperial examination.|$|E

In Chomsky's view {{there is little reason}} to believe that academics are more inclined to engage in profound thought than other members of society and that the designation [...] "intellectual" [...] obscures the truth of the intellectual division of labour: [...] "These are funny words actually, I mean being an 'intellectual' has almost nothing to do with working with your mind; these are two different things. My suspicion is that plenty of people in the crafts, auto mechanics and so on, probably do as much or more intellectual work as people in the universities. [...] There are plenty of areas in academia where what's called 'scholarly' work is just clerical work, and I don't think clerical work's more challenging than fixing an automobile engine—in fact, I think the opposite.... So if by 'intellectual' you <b>mean</b> <b>people</b> who are using their minds, then it's all over society" [...] (Understanding Power, p.96).|$|E
2500|$|Bishop Isidore of Seville (560–636) {{taught in}} his widely read encyclopedia, the Etymologies, diverse views {{such as that}} the Earth [...] "resembles a wheel" [...] {{resembling}} Anaximander in language and the map that he provided. This was widely interpreted as referring to a disc-shaped Earth. An illustration from Isidore's De Natura Rerum shows the five zones of the earth as adjacent circles. Some have concluded that he thought the Arctic and Antarctic zones were adjacent to each other. He did not admit the possibility of antipodes, which he took to <b>mean</b> <b>people</b> dwelling {{on the opposite side}} of the Earth, considering them legendary and noting that there was no evidence for their existence. Isidore's T and O map, which was seen as representing a small part of a spherical Earth, continued to be used by authors through the Middle Ages, e.g. the 9th-century bishop Rabanus Maurus who compared the habitable part of the northern hemisphere (Aristotle's northern temperate clime) with a wheel. At the same time, Isidore's works also gave the views of sphericity, for example, in chapter 28 of De Natura Rerum, Isidore claims that the sun orbits the earth and illuminates the other side when it is night on this side. See French translation of De Natura Rerum. In his other work Etymologies, there are also affirmations that the sphere of the sky has earth in its center and the sky being equally distant on all sides. Other researchers have argued these points as well. [...] "The work remained unsurpassed until the thirteenth century and was regarded as the summit of all knowledge. It became an essential part of European medieval culture. Soon after the invention of typography it appeared many times in print." [...] However, [...] "The Scholastics - later medieval philosophers, theologians, and scientists - were helped by the Arabic translators and commentaries, but they hardly needed to struggle against a flat-earth legacy from the early middle ages (500-1050). Early medieval writers often had fuzzy and imprecise impressions of both Ptolemy and Aristotle and relied more on Pliny, but they felt (with one exception), little urge to assume flatness." ...|$|E
