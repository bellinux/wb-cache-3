40|$|Measurements by probes {{and other}} {{diagnostics}} {{show that the}} radial transport in the scrape-off-layer (SOL) is partially determined by discrete intermittency events. A <b>magnetic</b> <b>divertor</b> [1] in a tokamak provides heat and particle exhaust and shields the main plasma from impurity contamination. Heat and particles are transported from the plasma core to the edge and where they are, in turn, conducted and convected to the divertor, which is optimized to reduce structural damage and impurity release. The balance between parallel and perpendicular transport in the SOL results in measured SOL radial profiles that are typically near exponential [2] with short (1 – 3 cm) decay lengths near the separatrix. However, evidence [3 – 5] that the SOL profiles can be very wide and flat abounds, suggesting larger than usual radial transport.

The top-level numerical procedure (KN 1 D) sets up the model geometry, numerical grid, and boundary conditions and principally calls two sub-programs, one which handles the spatial evolution of the molecular distribution function and the resultant velocity space source of atomic hydrogen (Kinetic_H 2) and one which handles the spatial evolution of the atomic distribution function (Kinetic_H).

40|$|As {{magnetic}} confinement fusion progresses towards {{the development of}} first reactor-scale devices, computational tokamak divertor design is a topic of high priority. Presently, edge plasma codes are used in a forward approach, where <b>magnetic</b> field and <b>divertor</b> geometry are manually adjusted to meet design requirements. Due to the complex edge plasma flows and large number of design variables, this method is computationally very demanding. On the other hand, efficient optimization-based design strategies have been developed in computational aerodynamics and fluid mechanics. Such an optimization approach to divertor target shape design is elaborated in the present paper. A general formulation of the design problems is given, and conditions characterizing the optimal designs are formulated. Using a continuous adjoint framework, design sensitivities can be computed {{at a cost of}} only two edge plasma simulations, independent of the number of design variables.

40|$|Divertor {{particle}} {{and power}} exhaust system design {{is still a}} key issue to be resolved to evolve from experimental fusion reactors to commercial power plants. In particular the excessive heat load to the divertor geometry structure needs to be tackled. The divertor design process is assisted by computationally extremely demanding codes simulating the complex physics of the plasma edge. In order to reduce design costs, advanced adjoint based automated design methods from aerodynamics have recently been adapted for use in divertor shape design. A similar methodology is sought to enable these adjoint based methods for magnetic configuration design. However, adjoint sensitivities of the plasma edge grid generator are difficult to obtain, as those grids are aligned with the magnetic field to overcome numerical noise arising from the strongly anisotropic plasma flow. First of all, this results in computational grid boundaries that change with varying magnetic fields. A second difficulty is the necessity to use a curvilinear coordinate system attached to the magnetic field that is implied by the grid generator. A Practical and in Parts Adjoint Based Gradient Computation Methodology for Efficient Optimal <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Divertor</b> Design in Nuclear Fusion ReactorsIn this paper, these difficulties are overcome by using a combined finite differences/continuous adjoint gradient computation. An adjoint plasma edge simulation is used to overcome the high computational cost of the plasma edge simulations during gradient calculations. At the same time, the computationally less demanding yet more difficult grid generator adjoint sensitivities are avoided by making use of a finite difference approach to differentiate the remaining terms within a Lagrangian multiplier approach. Moreover, an extensive analytical derivation of the partial derivatives of the plasma edge equations {{with respect to the}} geometrical parameters is avoided by using the finite difference approach through the forward plasma edge solver as well.

40|$|Particle {{and power}} exhaust {{is a key}} {{performance}} issue for next step fusion reactors. Divertors need to be designed to handle power exhaust and to provide sufficient Helium pumping capacity. Plasma edge transport codes such as B 2 -Eirene [1, 2] are indispensable {{for the design of}} future divertor concepts, as they allow for the extrapolation of the current understanding of the edge plasma physics to fusion reactor relevant operating regimes. Due to the long simulation times, it is impossible to consider many different geometries and operating points during the design process. Thus, different design requirements and constraints, combined with the large number of control variables turn divertor design into a challenging problem. Over the past decades similar design challenges are faced both in aerodynamics and in structural mechanics. In aerodynamics, shape optimization was introduced to design airfoils for drag reduction or lift maximization [3]. In structural mechanics topology optimization was used to design sufficiently strong constructions at minimal weight and material costs [4]. The method was further developed in fluid mechanics applications to achieve optimal flow configurations [5]. All problems have been treated very effectively by using optimization approaches including adjoint PDE formalisms for computing design sensitivities. Recently, adjoint based automated design methods were explored for fusion reactor and heat sink design. These methods start from a cost functional, which is a measure for the performance of a certain design, and identify optimal solutions by minimizing this cost functional. The minimum is hereby achieved through gradient-based optimization algorithms, where adjoint sensitivity analysis is used to keep gradient evaluation costs sufficiently low. With a detailed parameterization of the divertor shape, and the use of several divertor coils, the number of design variables can easily exceed hundreds or even thousands. For topology optimization of heat sinks every grid cell contains the porosity as a control parameter to assess whether a cooling channel or a fin structure is desired. In previous work [6, 7], it is demonstrated that shape optimization methods applied to divertor shape design can efficiently propose divertors which optimize target power load spreading. Typically, V-shaped targets are found. Using adjoint methods for sensitivity analysis, simulation times needed for the optimization cycle are of the order of only a few simulations of the corresponding analysis problem. Also radiation heat loads, computed by a Monte Carlo method, could be incorporated within this methodology [8]. A similar methodology is developed for magnetic configuration design. However, adjoint sensitivities of the plasma edge grid generator are difficult to obtain. Therefore in parts adjoint techniques were developed [9, 10]. Again, the optimization methodology successfully alters the magnetic configuration to reduced heat peaks. Further, the perspectives of topology optimization for cooling designs was investigated and led to branch-like cooling channel patterns for micro-channel heat sinks [11]. In the present paper, the status, perspectives and challenges for optimization tools both in divertor configurations and cooling designs will be reviewed. [1] Reiter, D. et al. (2005). Fus. Sci.

40|$|Puff and pump' {{radiating}} divertor scenarios [1, 2] {{were applied}} to upper SN and DN H-mode plasmas. Under similar operating conditions, argon (Ar) accumulated in the main plasma of single-null (SN) plasmas more rapidly and reached a higher steady-state concentration when the B x {del}B ion drift direction was toward the divertor than when the B x {del}B ion drift direction {{was out of the}} divertor. The initial rate that Ar accumulated inside double-null (DN) plasmas was more than twice that of comparably-prepared SNs with the same B x {del}B direction. One way to reduce power loading at the divertor targets is to 'seed' the divertor plasma with impurities that radiatively reduce the conducted power. Studies have shown that the concentration of impurities in the divertor are increased by raising the flow of deuterium ions (D{sup +}) into the divertor by a combination of upstream deuterium gas puffing and active particle exhaust at the divertor targets, i. e., puff-and-pump. An enhanced D{sup +} particle flow toward the divertor targets exerts a frictional drag on impurities, and inhibits their escape from the divertor. A puff-and-pump approach using Ar as the impurity was successfully applied in recent DIII-D experiments to SN plasmas [3] while maintaining good H-mode performance. Studies on DIII-D and other tokamaks have shown that both the direction of the toroidal magnetic field B{sub T} and the degree of <b>magnetic</b> balance between <b>divertors</b> [i. e., {{the degree to which the}} plasma shape is considered SN or DN] are important factors in determining recycling and particle pumping [4, 5].

40|$|Abstract: We present recent {{results on}} {{turbulence}} measurements in TCV L-mode plasmas. It {{has been shown}} that the heat transport is reduced by a factor of two for a plasma at negative triangularity compared with a plasma at positive triangularity. This transport reduction is reflected in the reduction of the temperature fluctuation level, in the low frequency part of the spectrum (20 - 120 kHz), measured by correlation ECE in the outer equatorial plane. Nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations predict that the TEM turbulence might be dominant for these TCV plasmas. The TEM induced transport is shown to decrease with decreasing triangularity and increasing collisionality. Both dependences are in fairly good agreement with experimental observations. We also report on an innovative <b>divertor</b> <b>magnetic</b> configuration: the snowflake (SF) divertor whose properties are expected to affect the local heat load to the divertor plates in particular during ELMs when compared with the classical single-null (SN) divertor. In L-mode plasmas, the intermittent particle and heat transport in the SOL is associated with the presence of "blobs " propagating in the radial direction. Intermittency is compared between SN and SF configurations by looking at the statistical properties of the ion saturation current Jsat measured wit...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{diagnostics}} for the {{new generation}} fusion reactor “ITER ” are required to be extremely reliable since they provide measurements essential for reactor operation and protection, plasma control and for measurement of several parameters fundamental to the plasma operation, such as plasma current and shape, disruptions and high frequency macro instabilities. ITER magnetic diagnostics consist of various sets of inductive coils and loops mounted on the inner wall, outside the vacuum vessel and {{in some of the}} divertor cassettes [1]. All these probes measure magnetic field or flux variations with respect to time, requiring a precise integration of the signals to recover the absolute values of the field components. They operate in a harsh reactor environment, subjected to nuclear heat loads mainly due to the neutron radiation, generated by the burning plasma. Difficult or impossible access after assembly requires reliability, especially in the area of wiring, connections and vacuum feed-throughs and in choosing margin against radiation damage and extreme transient electrical loads. Additional disturbing effects can arise when both a strong transient magnetic field and thermal gradient occur within the coil structure. All these aspects set a serial of strict design requirements and imply a serious technical challenge. This paper is focused on the design, simulation and optimization of the ITER <b>divertor</b> <b>magnetic</b> tangential coils. The divertor is one of the components...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{critical}} issues for ITER is access to an H-mode regime with good confinement, H- 98 = 1. The most basic scaling laws for power threshold for the L-H transition, P-th, take the variation with plasma density, magnetic field and plasma size into account. However, the large variations in the P-th data from the values estimated with such simple scaling laws indicate other underlying dependencies. Another important consideration for ITER is that H-modes with higher values of energy confinement factors are often obtained with input power values much greater than P-th. This paper presents results from recent studies on JET to assess possible hidden variables for H-mode access {{over a wide range}} of plasma conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that sensitivity to the <b>magnetic</b> shaping and <b>divertor</b> geometry could account for some of the scatter in the international power threshold database. Hysteresis in the L-H transition P-th has been studied in detail {{for the first time on}} JET by comparing values of P-th at the forward and back H-mode transitions over a range of densities. The impact of the edge plasma rotation on H-mode access has also been considered on JET with a toroidal field ripple scan across the L-H and H-L transitions. Finally, the total input power required relative to the measured value of Pt...|$|R
40|$|Non-axisymmetric {{stationary}} magnetic perturbations lead to {{the formation}} of homoclinic tangles near the <b>divertor</b> <b>magnetic</b> saddle in tokamak discharges. These tangles intersect the divertor plates in static helical structures that delimit the regions reached by open magnetic field lines reaching the plasma column and leading the charged particles to the strike surfaces by parallel transport. In this article we introduce a non-axisymmetric rotating magnetic perturbation to model the time development of the three-dimensional magnetic field of a single-null DIII-D tokamak discharge developing a rotating tearing mode. The stable and unstable manifolds of the asymmetric magnetic saddle are calculated through an adaptive method providing the manifold cuts at a given poloidal plane and the strike surfaces. For the modeled shot, the experimental heat pattern and its time development are well described by the rotating unstable manifold, indicating the emergence of homoclinic lobes in a rotating frame due to the plasma instabilities. In the model it is assumed that the magnetic field is created by a stationary axisymmetric plasma current and a set of rotating internal helical filamentary currents. The currents in the filaments are adjusted to match the waveforms of the magnetic probes at the mid-plane and the rotating magnetic field is introduced as a perturbation to the axisymmetric field obtained from a Grad-Shafranov equilibrium reconstruction code...|$|R
40|$|Under this {{contract}} {{the authors have}} contributed to ITER edged plasma physics by improving the numerics {{and the organization of}} the B 2. 5 edge plasma code, by applying the code in a systematic study of the effect of deliberately introduced impurities upon the divertor heat load, by collaborating with colleagues at IPP Garching in their studies of the ITER divertor using the B 2 /EIRENE code system and in their model validation studies, and by kinetic studies of the possible beneficial effects of <b>magnetic</b> perturbations upon <b>divertor</b> heat load. In regard to the effect of recycling impurities their modeling indicates that {{it will be possible to}} radiate up to 200 MW in the edge plasma and divertor if the edge density is sufficiently high ({approx_equal} 6. 0 {times} 10 {sup 19 }/m{sup 3 }) and if there is maintained a concentration of 1. 0 % neon or 0. 5 % argon. This implies that an acceptable working point for ITER may just barely be possible with credit for bremsstrahlung and edge radiation alone, and a robust working point appears possible if consideration is given also to core plasma impurity radiation. In regard to the effect of magnetic perturbations they find that a scenario that relies on external windings requires coils no further than about 0. 3 m outside the separatrix, which appears unacceptable given the radiation environment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Results on {{plasma heating}} in {{experiments}} with {{neutral beam injection}} (NBI) and {{ion cyclotron resonance heating}} (ICRH) at the fundamental harmonic of hydrogen minority in deuterium plasma in the Globus-M spherical tokamak are presented. Numerical simulation of fast ion trajectories was performed in the plasma configurations reconstructed from magnetic measurements {{with the help of the}} EFIT code. Energy spectra of slowing down fast ions were measured with tangentially and perpendicularly directed neutral particle analysers in a wide range of energies. Reliable H-mode transition was achieved after the change of the toroidal magnetic field direction. The ion drift now is directed towards the lower X-point, which exists inside the vessel even in a limiter configuration. The most stable H mode transition was achieved in NBI experiments. Also L-H transition was observed in ohmic heating (OH) regime and at ICRH in limiter and <b>divertor</b> <b>magnetic</b> configurations. By means of multi-channel multi-pulse Thomson scattering (TS) diagnostic we observed a formation of a steep density gradient after the L-H transition. Flat density distribution in the plasma bulk was sustained during all the H-mode period. Modeling of transport processes in the L and H-modes was performed with the help of the ASTRA code. The calculated energy confinement times are consistent with the ITER scalings. It is shown that in the ion heat conductivity remains neoclassical the H-mode and no barrier is formed for the ion temperature profile. The particle diffusion coefficient is reduced sufficiently inside the transport barrier region. 1...|$|R
