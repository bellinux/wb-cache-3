My views should not be attributed {{to any of the}} organizations with which I am affiliated. No issue ignites such fierce passions as the taxation of capital gains. Columbia law professor Michael Graetz (1997) referred to the epic battle between President George H. W. Bush and Senate <b>Majority</b> <b>Leader</b> <b>George</b> <b>Mitchell</b> as “the madness of two Georges. ” President Bush was convinced that cutting tax rates on capital gains would turbocharge the economy and actually increase tax revenues. He could not understand why Democrats in the Senate would stand in the way. Senator Mitchell, however, was convinced that cutting capital gains tax rates would simply provide an unfair windfall to the wealthiest people in society. How should capital gains be taxed? Under an income tax the answer is that capital gains should be taxed in full as they are earned, not when realized. Capital gains are income, not really different in substance from interest, rents, and royalties: other kinds of capital income that are taxed as ordinary income. Under the pure comprehensive income tax, corporate income would be allocated to shareholders and taxed as ordinary income, {{in the same way that}} S-corporations an...|$|E

After pleading with Senate Committee on Appropriations chair Robert Byrd, Congress began considering a relief bill. President Bush proposed a $7.1 billion disaster aid package to provide disaster benefits, small-business loans, crop loss loans, food stamps, and public housing for victims of Hurricane Andrew. However, the United States House of Representatives considered allotting $8.8 billion in the disaster bill. After the United States House of Representatives appropriated aid to victims of Hurricane Iniki in Hawaii and Typhoon Omar in Guam, the cost was later increased to $11.1 billion. The bill, which was the most costly disaster aid package at the time, was passed by Congress as House Resolution 5620 on September 18, and signed into law by President Bush on September 23. Two days after Hurricane Andrew, state officials established a temporary relief center at the South Florida Fairgrounds near West Palm Beach. While in operation, more than 20,000 volunteers moved about 4,500 tons of supplies [...] unto more than 1,200 trucks for distribution to the victims of the storm. By September 27, the relief distribution center at the South Florida Fairgrounds closed. In addition, the Boy Scouts of America also assisted in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew. In Glennville, Georgia, a Boy Scout troop and two Cub Scout packs filled a 48 ft truck with food after collecting door-to-door. Similarly, another Cub Scout pack in North Palm Beach, Florida packed a truck full of emergency supplies.
