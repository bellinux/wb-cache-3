30|$|Cyclotron {{resonance}} is now applied {{as one of}} {{the important}} means for heating plasma in a fusion reactor. We examined this phenomenon from the viewpoint of electron gyration orbits through a solution of the linearized relativistic equation of motion. We found a powerful term that accelerates a relativistic charged particle largely at a resonance point when a magnetic field strength is very large. In this study, aiming an effect of this term, we consider applying a resonance phenomenon to reducing the number of charged particles that escape from a magnetic <b>mirror</b> <b>reactor.</b> We install a long supplemental device at the exit of a main magnetic bottle and make a cyclotron resonance space within the device, as shown in Fig.  7. If velocities (perpendicular to a magnetic field) of charged particles are accelerated largely within the cyclotron resonance space, the reflection efficiency of a magnetic mirror behind the resonance space ought to be improved. Based on this idea, we discuss such a supplemental device for recovering the maximum number of escaping charged particles.|$|E

The characteristics that are compared are Initial Mass in Low Earth Orbit (IMLEO), mission flexibility, and flight times. The propulsion systems being compared are both demonstrated and envisioned: Chemical (or Cryogenic), Nuclear Thermal Rocket (NTR) solid core, NTR gas core, Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP), and a mirror fusion space propulsion system. The proposed magnetic mirror fusion reactor, {{known as the}} Mirror Fusion Propulsion System (MFPS), is described.

40|$|Abstract. The {{improvement}} of potential confinement {{reported in the}} last IAEA meeting was attained by axisymmetrization of heating pattern of electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH). It was experimentally shown that the axisymmetrization of ECRH really produced axisymmetric potential profile. GAMMA 10 experiments have advanced in longer sustainment and high density operation of potential confinement. Experiments for long sustainment of potential confinement were carried out in order to study problems of steady state operation of a tandem <b>mirror</b> <b>reactor.</b> A confining potential was sustained for 150 ms by sequentially injecting two (ECRH) powers in the plug region. It was difficult before to increase the central cell density higher than about 2. 5 1012 cm- 3 with and/or without potential confinement due to some density limiting mechanism. In order to overcome this problem, a new higher frequency ion cyclotron range of frequency (ICRF) system (RF 3 : 36 76 MHz) has been installed. A higher density plasma has been produced with RF 3. In addition to RF 3, neutral beam injection (NBI) in the anchor cell became effective by reducing neutral gas from beam injectors. Potential confinement experiments have advanced to higher central cell densities up to 4 1012 cm- 3 with RF 3 and NBI. A 20 % density increase due to the potential confinement was obtained in the high density experiments. 1...|$|E
50|$|With {{respect to}} batch and plug flow {{reactors}} (PFRs), the dispersities {{for the different}} polymerization methods are the same. This is largely because while batch reactors depend entirely on time of reaction, plug flow reactors depend on distance traveled in the reactor and its length. Since time and distance are related by velocity, plug flow reactors can be designed to <b>mirror</b> batch <b>reactors</b> by controlling the velocity and length of the reactor. Continuously stirred-tank reactors (CSTRs) however have a residence time distribution and cannot mirror batch or plug flow reactors, which can cause {{a difference in the}} dispersity of final polymer.|$|R
50|$|William Barr and Ralph Moir {{then ran}} a group which did {{a series of}} direct energy {{conversion}} experiments through the late 1970s and early 1980s. The first experiments used beams of positives and negatives as fuel, and demonstrated energy capture at a peak efficiency of 65 percent and a minimum efficiency of 50 percent. The following experiments involved a true plasma direct converter that was tested on the Tandem Mirror Experiment (TMX), an operating magnetic <b>mirror</b> fusion <b>reactor.</b> In the experiment, the plasma moved along diverging field lines, spreading it out and converting it into a forward moving beam with a Debye length of a few centimeters. Suppressor grids then reflect the electrons, and collector anodes recovered the ion energy byslowing them down and collecting them at high-potential plates. This machine demonstrated an energy capture efficiency of 48 percent. However, Marshall Rosenbluth argued that keeping the plasma's neutral charge over the very short Debye length distance would be very challenging in practice, though he said that this problem would not occur in every version of this technology.|$|R
40|$|A {{subcritical}} fission blanket {{driven by}} a Gas Dynamic Trap-Neutron Source (GDT-NS) {{has the ability to}} eliminate significant quantities of the weapons-grade plutonium that the US has held in surplus {{since the end of the}} cold war. The GDT is a variant of the traditional <b>mirror</b> fusion <b>reactor</b> and shares with it an ability to produce focused neutron emissions. Recent results have confirmed plasma stability at high β and with these results GDT models have been extrapolated. It is now thought that this device could produce sufficient neutrons for industrial scale transmutation. ^ To assist in the blanket design and optimization, the Fusion Actinide Burner (FAB) toolkit was developed to assist in blanket development acting as an interface with the Monte Carlo n-Particle code (MCNP 6). This toolkit consists of simplified and detailed blanket models, iterative problem solving, data visualization, and a fuel cycle / burnup capability integrated with the ORIGEN isotope generation and depletion code. The toolkit was benchmarked successfully to a series of mirror fusion-fission hybrid designs. ^ Early blanket development for the Gas Dynamic Trap - Plutonium Burner (GDT-PB) heavily referenced work done under the Accelerator Transmutation of Waste program led at Los Alamos in the late 1990 s. Due to the compact design of the GDT-NS, the accelerator driven designs are more applicable than the larger tokamak-driven hybrid designs which have received more recent study. ^ The focus moved towards optimizing the blanket to be couple with the GDT-NS.

30|$|In {{the early}} days of {{cyclotron}}s, the study of cyclotron resonance served to determine gas plasma condition from the characteristics of electromagnetic waves having passed through the plasma [1] But large quantities of wave energy are absorbed by charged particles when the wave frequency is nearly equal to the particles’ cyclotron frequency. This phenomenon is now an important means to heat charged particles in a gas plasma [2 – 7]. We examined cyclotron resonance from a viewpoint of gyration orbits of an electron in a plane perpendicular to a static magnetic field, using a solution of the linearized relativistic equation of motion which was obtained under the condition given in Eq. (5) later. In this examination, we found a term that accelerates a relativistic charged particle rapidly, when a magnetic field strength is very large, at a resonance point where an electric field frequency is equal to a charged particle’s cyclotron frequency. The term is given as second part in Eq. (18). Aiming an effect of this term, we consider improving a reflection efficiency of a magnetic mirror by installing a resonance space within the magnetic mirror. Plasma confinement by a magnetic mirror was greatly expected {{in the early stages of}} fusion research [8 – 10]. This is because adiabatic theory with respect to a motion of a charged particle (a particle moves as it winds around one magnetic flux) gave a clear theoretical prediction for plasma confinement. But magnetic mirror-type reactors had the drawback that too many charged particles are lost along the magnetic field line. Both the open magnetic (mirror-type) and the closed magnetic (toroidal-type) systems still have instability problems that obstruct the way to a controlled fusion reactor. Mirror-type research continues in <b>mirror</b> hybrid <b>reactors</b> [11 – 13]. In hybrid reactor research, plasma confinement demands can be relaxed if the fission reaction induces strong energy multiplication. However, research reports that shortcomings still exist, such as the charged particle loss from the loss cone and associated low electron temperature.|$|R

The advantages of flow technology are currently very clear as opposed to conventional batch methods. Most strikingly and relevant for pharmaceutical’s time-to-market needs, flow processing has the important advantage of the ease with which reaction conditions can be scaled. As this technology is new and has major full-process scale implications, we also wanted to point out that this cannot be applied and released to all chemistries yet, thereby also critically mirroring disadvantages and advantages of the step-change technology. However, the positive impact has been dominating and thus pharmaceutical and fine-chemical industries have increased their awareness and interest in flow chemistry applications.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{doctoral}} dissertation was to improve the production of methane by mechanical and enzymatic pretreatments of organic substrates. For anaerobic digestion of different substrates and determination of biomethane potential, Automatic Methane Potential Test System (AMPTS II) device was used. AMPTS II is an analytical laboratory scale device used in measurements of ultra low speed production of biomethane produced during the anaerobic digestion of biodegradable substrates. Although biogas yields of biogas plants arelimited to the specific substrates, methane yields are difficult to generalize from the collected data in published literature due to different modifications of substrates, including particle size reduction or chemical pretreatment all affecting their properties and energy recovery. Therefore, for biogas plant decision making the data need {{to be derived from}} inoculum of concrete biogas plant and substrates in such a condition as to be dosed in anaerobic reactors on real industrial scale. By upgrading commercial system AMPTS II from 0. 5 liters to 5 liters, a pilot scale device was developed and validated for such real-scale experiments <b>mirroring</b> anaerobic <b>reactors</b> at the biogas plant. On 5 liter pilot scale biomethane yield of 24 substrates in solid or liquid form was assessed and compared with existing published data. By adding a variety of additives in the form of enzymes and micro-organisms in the process of anaerobic digestion, the impact on the production of methane and enhancement of the production of methane was evaluated. A combination of different substrates from paper mill sludge from Kraft process, a dehydrated paper mill sludge, bio-waste and lignocellulosic substrate an optimization of methane production in batch mode was conducted. The effects of the addition of hydrolytic enzymes on the production of methane from dehydrated paper mill sludge from Paloma was further tested in semi - continuous experiments. Significant improvements were detected. In the next following semi - continuous experiments an ultrasonic pre-treatment of sludge from the treatment plant in combination with the addition of hydrolytic enzymes was tested. In addition, the operation of the biogas plant Vučja vas was monitored for a period of 5 months during the substrate fluctuation period. Using T- RFLP technique the effects of enzyme and incubation time on the structure of bacterial and archeae consortium were assessed. By using software STATISTICA an optimal combinations of substrates in a batch mode were determined...|$|R

40|$|Light-based {{diagnostic}} {{systems of}} fusion <b>reactors</b> require optical <b>mirrors</b> to channel {{light through the}} structures surrounding the plasma. With increasing plasma volume, power and plasma burn time, the environmental conditions grow more demanding and new requirements arise. In this dissertation, the design of optical mirrors inside the vacuum chamber of the prototype reactor ITER (Latin "the way") and future fusion power plants are investigated. Comparing {{the state of the}} art with the boundary conditions close to the fusion plasma, existing mirror designs and choices for the reflective surface are evaluated. For the design, it is not the individual boundary conditions that are critical, but rather, their combination and the resulting interactions. Drawing from the existing designs, possible realizations for central functionality are discussed. Included in the discussion are substrate choice, mounting, adjustment and thermal contacting as well as positioning of the mirror assembly compatible with hot cell maintenance. Building on the general discussion, mirror concepts for the charge exchange recombination spectroscopy (CXRS) diagnostic system for the ITER plasma core are proposed and simulated. In addition, prototypes are manufactured and tested to assess critical aspects of the proposed design. Testing includes positioning by pins, manufacturing of a stainless steel substrate with fluid channels adapted to the mirror shape, and tests with an SiO$_ 2 $/TiO$_ 2 $ dielectric coating under selected ITER conditions. As a result of the work, the fusion <b>reactor</b> <b>mirror</b> design considerations given in the principal design discussion can be used as a basis for other diagnostic systems as well.
