We have examined the similarities of 3 D HLAC features by applying 3 D HLAC <b>masks</b> <b>patterns</b> to each 3 D model in a database.

40|$|Forward masking is a {{phenomenon}} that occurs when one stimulus (masker) elevates the threshold for perception of a subsequent stimulus (probe). In cochlear implant listeners, it has been hypothesized that interactions between electrodes (termed channel interactions) can have a deleterious effect on speech recognition (Chatterjee and Shannon, 1998; Throckmorton and Collins, 1999). Forward masking is one measure {{that has been used}} to assess channel interactions (Shannon, 1983; Tong and Clark, 1986; Lim et al., 1986; Shannon, 1990; Blamey and Dooley, 1993; Chatterjee and Shannon, 1998), and it has also been proposed as a mechanism {{that could be used to}} assess information that is being presented to but is not received by the user (Throckmorton and Collins, 1999; Nogueira et al., 2005). Determining information that is not received by the user, or is masked, has the potential to provide guidance for the design of new speech processing algorithms that either work to reduce lost information or substitute alternate information. Nogueira et al., (2005) investigated the potential for using forward masking to estimate masked information and found a limited benefit with information substitution; however, their findings were based on normal hearing psychoacoustic forward <b>masking</b> <b>patterns</b> (Nogueira et al., 2005). Given that psychophysically measured forward <b>masking</b> <b>patterns</b> vary from subject to subject and electrode to electrode (e. g. Shannon, 1983; Shannon, 1990; Chatterjee and Shannon, 1998), measuring subject- and electrode-specific patterns has the potential to provide a more accurate assessment of masked information. In addition, the experimental time required to gather the full set of psychophysical forward <b>masking</b> <b>patterns</b> for all electrodes is far too long for clinical relevance (Throckmorton and Collins, 1999). Recently, it has been suggested that forward <b>masking</b> <b>patterns</b> can be measured physiologically via the electrically evoked compound action potential (ECAP) (e. g. Hughes and Stille, 2009) which may make it possible to measure the information necessary for a subject-specific assessment of masked information in a clinically relevant time frame. This study utilized ECAP measurements to estimate the forward <b>masking</b> <b>patterns</b> in subjects, and these <b>masking</b> <b>patterns</b> were used to estimate the masked stimuli in speech. The estimates were validated using a speech reception threshold task to assess whether speech recognition is affected by removing "masked" pulses from a subject's stimulation pattern. The results of this study suggest that forward <b>masking</b> <b>patterns</b> measured via ECAPs could potentially determine information that is not being perceived by the user. The masked stimuli were also used to statistically evaluate the segments of speech that are most vulnerable to masking. These results suggest that the amount of masking that occurs per phoneme depends on the characteristics of the subject-specific <b>masking</b> <b>patterns.</b> Thesi...|$|R

5000|$|In {{photolithography}} for {{the mass}} production of integrated circuit devices, the more correct term is usually photoreticle or simply reticle. In {{the case of a}} photomask, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the <b>mask</b> <b>pattern</b> and the wafer pattern. This was the standard for the 1:1 mask aligners that were succeeded by steppers and scanners with reduction optics. As used in steppers and scanners, the reticle commonly contains only one layer of the chip. (However, some photolithography fabrications utilize reticles with more than one layer patterned onto the same mask). The pattern is projected and shrunk by four or five times onto the wafer surface. To achieve complete wafer coverage, the wafer is repeatedly [...] "stepped" [...] from position to position under the optical column until full exposure is achieved.|$|E
50|$|Leading-edge photomasks (pre-corrected) {{images of}} the final chip {{patterns}} magnified by 4 times. This magnification factor has been a key benefit in reducing pattern sensitivity to imaging errors. However, as features continue to shrink, two trends come into play: {{the first is that}} the mask error factor begins to exceed one, i.e., the dimension error on the wafer may be more than 1/4 the dimension error on the mask, and the second is that the mask feature is becoming smaller, and the dimension tolerance is approaching a few nanometers. For example, a 25 nm wafer pattern should correspond to a 100 nm <b>mask</b> <b>pattern,</b> but the wafer tolerance could be 1.25 nm (5% spec), which translates into 5 nm on the photomask. The variation of electron beam scattering in directly writing the photomask pattern can easily well exceed this.|$|E

30|$|Fabrication {{processes}} of nanostructured Si (Si nanowire or Si nanowall) are roughly {{divided into two}} types: top-down and bottom-up, i.e., etching of bulk Si [12 – 16] and growing Si nanowire on a substrate [17]. The advantage of the top-down process is the easy control of the direction of nanostructured Si. The starting material of this method is a Si wafer; therefore, material quality is also high enough. The typical top-down process consists of a <b>mask</b> <b>patterning</b> and anisotropic etching. The arrangement of nanostructured Si can be controlled by <b>mask</b> <b>patterning.</b> By the combination of <b>mask</b> <b>patterning,</b> e.g., nanoimprint and photolithography, and anisotropic etching, e.g., metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) [18 – 20] and reactive ion etching (RIE), various processes are selectable. We have developed a device integration process of Si nanowire with a diameter of 30  nm using silica nanoparticle dispersion and MACE [21], and confirmed the photovoltaic power generation of the axial-junction Si nanowire solar cell [22].

40|$|Abstract Elevation of the {{threshold}} of audibility occurs in hearing-impaired people, and these individuals have an expanded auditory filter (Glasberg and Moore, 1986). Threshold elevation is assumed to occur due {{to an increase in}} frequency components that pass the auditory filter; an assumption known as the “power spectrum model ” of masking (Patterson and Moore, 1986). Therefore, we attempted here to remove from the speech signal the frequency components that are not related to speech perception, but are instead related to threshold elevation. We calculated the <b>masking</b> <b>pattern</b> using the spreading function (Painter and Spanias, 1997), and processed monosyllabic speech samples using nine kinds of <b>masking</b> <b>patterns.</b> Both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired subjects evaluated the intelligibility and sound quality of the original and processed monosyllables. For hearing-impaired subjects, the intelligibility of a small number of certain processed monosyllables increased, but sound quality did not improve. For normal-hearing subjects, speech intelligibility decreased as the <b>masking</b> <b>pattern</b> expanded, and application of the proposed method showed no significant improvement in sound quality...|$|R

40|$|Mask {{manufacturability}} {{has been}} considered as {{a major issue in}} the adoption of inverse lithography (IL) in practice. With smaller technology nodes, IL distorts the <b>mask</b> <b>pattern</b> more aggressively. The distorted mask often contains curvilinear contour and irregular shapes, which cast a heavy computation burden on segmentation and data preparation. Total variation (TV) has been used for regularization in previous work, but it is not very effective in regulating the mask shape to be rectangular. In this paper, we apply TV regularization not only on the mask image but also on the mask edges, which forces the curves of edges to be more vertical or horizontal, because they give smaller TV values. Except for rectilinearity, a group of geometrical specifications of the <b>mask</b> <b>pattern</b> set by mask manufacture rule control (MRC) is also important for mask manufacturability. To prevent these characteristics from appearing, we also propose an intervention scheme into the optimization framework. © 2009 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering. published_or_final_versionThe SPIE Lithography Asia 2009, Taipei, Taiwan, 18 November 2009. in Proceedings of SPIE, 2009, v. 7520, p. 1 - 11, article no. 75200...|$|E
