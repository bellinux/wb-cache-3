40|$|AbstractDimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) reductase from R. capsulatus {{contains}} a <b>molybdenum-pterin</b> <b>cofactor</b> at its active site. As prepared the molybdenum {{is in the}} 6 + oxidation state, devoid of EPR signals. Stepwise reduction generates an EPR signal characteristic of Mo(V) having hyperfine coupling to a single proton and integrating to less than 25 % of the total molybdenum. The low temperature MCD spectrum shows oppositely signed bands between ∼ 550 – 700 nm. These bands are assigned as dithiolene-to-Mo(V) charge transitions. A simple theoretical model can satisfactorily account for the bands in the MCD spectrum. No evidence is found for cysteine coordination to Mo(V) ...|$|E
40|$|Spinach leaf NADH:nitrate reductase (NR) {{responds}} to light/dark signals and photosynthetic activity {{in part as}} a result of rapid regulation by reversible protein phosphorylation. We have identified the major regulatory phosphorylation site as Ser- 543, which is located in the hinge 1 region connecting the cytochrome b domain with the <b>molybdenum-pterin</b> <b>cofactor</b> binding domain of NR, using recombinant NR fragments containing or lacking the phosphorylation site sequence. Studies with NR partial reactions indicated that the block in electron flow caused by phosphorylation also could be localized to the hinge 1 region. A synthetic peptide (NR 6) based on the phosphorylation site sequence was phosphorylated readily by NR kinase (NRk) in vitro. NR 6 kinase activity tracked the ATP-dependent inactivation of NR during several chromatographic steps and completely inhibited inactivation/phosphorylation of native NR in vitro. Two forms of NRk were resolved by using anion exchange chromatography. Studies with synthetic peptide analogs indicated that both forms of NRk had similar specificity determinants, requiring a basic residue at P- 3 (i. e., three amino acids N-terminal to the phosphorylated serine) and a hydrophobic residue at P- 5. Both forms are strictly calcium dependent but belong to distinct families of protein kinases because they are distinct immunochemically...|$|E
