50|$|The {{introduction}} of the trihedron (or trièdre), an invention of Darboux, allows for a conceptual simplification {{of the problem of}} moving frames on curves and surfaces by treating the coordinates of the point on the curve and the frame vectors in a uniform manner. A trihedron consists of a point P in Euclidean space, and three orthonormal vectors e1, e2, and e3 based at the point P. A <b>moving</b> <b>trihedron</b> is a trihedron whose components depend on one or more parameters. For example, a trihedron moves along a curve if the point P depends on a single parameter s, and P(s) traces out the curve. Similarly, if P(s,t) depends on a pair of parameters, then this traces out a surface.|$|E

40|$|In {{theoretical}} {{study of}} most of agricultural machines working bodies {{there is a need}} of the modeling of material particles (material points) motion on their working surfaces. Questions of such modeling in cases when the specified surfaces are give to material points movement with difficult trajectories are especially difficult. Objective of this research is to develop the basic provisions of complex movement theory of material point. When carrying out research methods of modeling theory, theoretical mechanics, higher mathematics, in particular differential geometry, methods of drawing up programs and numerical calculations on the personal computer are used. As a result of the conducted theoretical research the complex movement of material point which relative movement happens in a <b>moving</b> <b>trihedron</b> of curve which is defined by the natural equations is considered. The figurative movement of a trihedron is defined by differential characteristics of curve. Competency of use of Frenet formulas for finding absolute speed and point acceleration in projections on unit vectors of the <b>moving</b> <b>trihedron</b> is proved. As a result of numerical calculations on the personal computer there were found absolute trajectories of material point movement and qualitative assessment of received results was carried out...|$|E

Applications in geometry, computer vision, classical invariant theory, the calculus of variations, and numerical analysis are indicated. 1 Introduction. According to Akivis, [1], the idea of moving frames {{can be traced back}} to the method of <b>moving</b> <b>trihedrons</b> introduced by the Estonian mathematician Martin Bartels (1769 – 1836), a teacher of both Gauß and Lobachevsky. The modern method of moving frames or repères mobiles 1 was primarily developed by Éli...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we have {{obtained}} the distribution parameter of a ruled surface {{generated by a}} straight line in Frenet <b>trihedron</b> <b>moving</b> along a timelike curve and also along another curve with the same parameter. At this time, the Frenet frames of these timelike curves are not the same. We have moved the director vector of the first curve along the second curve. It is shown that the ruled surface is developable {{if and only if}} the base timelike curve is helix. In addition, some smilarities and differences are presented with theorems and results.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a new {{perspective}} on the generation of developable trajectory ruled surfaces in Minkowski 3 -space. Involute trajectory ruled surfaces generated by the Frenet <b>trihedron,</b> <b>moving</b> along spacelike involutes of a given timelike space curve, is stated according to Lorentzian timelike angle between tangent vector and unit vector of direction Darboux vector of this timelike space curve. Also some new results and theorems related to the developability of the involute trajectory timelike ruled surfaces are obtained. Finally we illustrate these surfaces by presenting one example.

40|$|Many {{types of}} common objects, such as tools and vehicles, usually move in simple ways {{when they are}} wielded or driven: The natural axes of the object tend to remain aligned with the local trihedron defined by the object’s trajectory. Based on this {{observation}} we use a model called Frenet-Serret motion which corre-sponds to the motion of a <b>moving</b> <b>trihedron</b> along a space curve. Knowing how the Frenet-Serret frame is changing relative to the observer gives us essential in-formation for understanding the object’s motion. This is illustrated here for four examples, involving tools (a wrench and a saw) and vehicles (an accelerating van, a turning taxi). ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} cyclical surfaces {{created by}} revolution {{of a circle}} about an edge of the trihedron of a conical he-lix that is moving evenly along the helix. This Euclidean metric transformation is composed from revolution {{about one of the}} coordinate axes and transformation of the right-handed coordinate system to the right-handed system of the <b>moving</b> <b>trihedron</b> in every point of the conical helix. This transformation is analytically represented by a func-tional matrix of 4 th order. These surfaces are determined at particular parameter values which have influence on the surface shape. The vector equation of surfaces and some illustrations of this group of surfaces are presented in the paper. The surfaces are illustrated and modelled in the programme Maple. Key words: cyclical surface, conical helix, trihedro...|$|E
40|$|It {{is noted}} that the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Moskawa (CKM) matrix {{elements}} for both quarks and leptons as conceived in the dualized standard model (DSM) {{can be interpreted as}} direction cosines obtained by <b>moving</b> the Darboux <b>trihedron</b> (a 3 -frame) along a trajectory on a sphere traced out through changing energy scales by a 3 -vector factorized from the mass matrix. From the Darboux analogues of the well-known Serret-Frenet formulas for space curves, it is seen that the corner elements (Vub,Vtd for quarks, and Ue 3,Utau 1 for leptons) are associated with the (geodesic) torsion, while the other off-diagonal elements (Vus,Vcd and Vcb,Vts for quarks, and Ue 2,Umu 1 and Umu 3,Utau 2 for leptons) with the (respectively, geodesic and normal) curvatures of the trajectory. From this it follows that (i) the corner elements in both matrices are much smaller than the other elements, and (ii) the Umu 3,Utau 2 elements for the lepton CKM matrix are much larger than their counterparts in the quark matrix. Both these conclusions are strongly borne out by experiment, for quarks in hadron decays and for leptons in neutrino oscillations, and by previous explicit calculations within the DSM scheme...|$|R
