5000|$|Plasmonics is {{the study}} of plasmons, quasiparticles of plasma {{oscillation}} in solids such as <b>metals,</b> semi-metals, <b>metal</b> <b>oxides,</b> <b>nitrides,</b> doped <b>semiconductors,</b> etc. An effort is currently being made to implement plasmons in electric circuits, or in an electric circuit analog, to combine the size efficiency of electronics with the data capacity of photonic integrated circuits. Plasmonics can be understood as [...] "light-on-metal-dielectric-interfaces," [...] where electrons oscillate at the surface of a metal due to strong resonant interactions with the electric field of incident light. Due to the high scattering rate of electrons, ohmic losses in plasmonic signals are generally large, which limits the signal transfer distances to the sub-centimeter range, unless hybrid optoplasmonic light guiding networks, or plasmon gain amplification are used. Both surface plasmon polaritons propagating along the metal-dielectric interfaces and localized surface plasmon modes supported by metal nanoparticles are characterized by large momentum values, which enable strong resonant enhancement of the local density of photon states, and can be utilized to enhance weak optical effects of opto-electronic devices.|$|R

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 123 - 154). Pulsed laser ablation in liquid (PLAL) is a promising top-down approach for nanoparticle production {{and it allows}} production of wide variety of nanoparticles such as <b>metal,</b> <b>metal</b> <b>oxide,</b> <b>nitride</b> and <b>semiconductor</b> nanocrystals. PLAL has numerous advantages compared to other nanoparticle production methods such as successful production of colloidal, pure and contamination-free nanoparticles. Pulsed laser ablation method {{was used for the}} production of a number of dierent nanoparticles both in liquids and gas environments. Moreover, both powder and bulk starting materials were employed for nanoparticle production. In the context of nanoparticle production and characterization, a systematic study for indium nitride nanocrystal (InN-NC) production was completed. The road-map for the production of ultra-smal hexagonall InN-NCs (< 5 nm in diameter) was demonstrated to be produced from InN powder target in ethanol by using PLAL technique. A real time nanoparticle exposure setup was designed and developed to reveal the health risks of laser material processing in the industry. In our study, adolescent rats were exposed to copper, tin and aluminum nanoparticles (CuNP, SnNP and AlNP, respectively) in the real-time exposure setup. We aimed to demonstrate the distribution of nanoparticles in the body by exposing the rats to the laser material processing environment. For this purpose, we dened the amount and characteristics of nanoparticles released during material processing by laser ablation. We also showed the eect of nanoparticles on learningmemory and mood of rats exposed to those nanoparticles via behavioral tests, electrophysiological and molecular methods. ICP-MS and TEM analysis revealed the presence of nanoparticles in almost all organs, including dierent regions of brain, indicating nanoparticles gained access to systemic circulation by inhalation. Both behavioral tests and in vivo electrophysiology experiments revealed that 3 months of CuNP, SnNP and AlNP exposure did not lead to any alterations in the learning and memory process of the rats. In hippocampi collected from rats exposed to SnNP and AlNP, the expression levels of NMDA receptor subunits, namely NMDAR 1 and NMDAR 2 a, were found to be increased, and the protein levels of NMDAR 1 decreased upon CuNP exposure. On the other hand, the toxicity of nanoparticles produced by pulsed laser ablation method in liquids was investigated for silver nanoaparticles (AgNPs) in hippocampal slices and CuNP, SnNP and AlNP nanoparticles in SH-SY 5 Y cell line in in vitro conditions. The cellular uptake mechanism of pure AgNPs was demonstrated as phagocytosis. Furthermore, AgNP led to dose-dependent toxicity in hippocampal slices. laser ablation is a considerably useful method for studying nanoparticle toxicity since it provides pure nanoparticles mimicking the ones encountered in the industry. Finally, it was shown that CuNP, SnNP and AlNP led to a dose-dependent cytotoxicity in SH-SY 5 Y cells. Moreover, it was shown that NMDAR subunits NMDAR 1 and NMDAR 2 a mRNA expressions and NMDAR 1 protein levels were altered after CuNP, SnNP and AlNP administration. This study showed, {{for the first time in}} the literature, that the nanoparticles produced during the laser material processing in the atmospheric environment are taken into the body via inhalation. These nanoparticles are distributed to a number of organs including lung, heart, liver, kidney, testis and so on. Moreover, these nanoparticles were detected in different brain regions, which indicates the severity of the risk for the people working in these industrial fields. We did not observe significant alterations in behavioral and electrophysiological evaluations in 3 months. However, in long-term exposures, accumulation of nanoparticles in brain may impose a high risk for dementias and mental disorders since these nanoparticles are made up of heavy metals which were shown to cause neurodegeneration. by Canan KurşungözPh.

In addition to problems arising from internal stress in such deposits, the thicker coatings often exhibit inhomogeneous structures, typically caused by growth defects or occluded particles. Formation of such defects or at least, inhibiting their propagation, must be prevented as far as possible during the coating process. This can be achieved for example, by using a special layer design on the nanometre scale. Using experimental results, some aspects of this approach are described in detail...|$|R

40|$|Solar {{energy is}} the most {{abundant}} source of renewable energy. The direct method of harnessing solar energy is the solar thermal conversion method using solar absorbers. The absorbers are coated with solar selective coatings with high absorptance and low thermal emittance. Spectrally selective coatings which are stable up to temperatures  300 C (in air and vacuum) have been developed in the past. These coatings are mainly deposited from wet chemical routes (e. g., electrodeposition) and have been reviewed widely in the literature. Because of the environmental issues as well as low thermal stability of these wet chemical deposited coatings, researchers {{all over the world}} started looking for other alternative routes such as physical vapor deposited (PVD) coatings. A great deal of research has been carried out since 1990 s to develop PVD coatings for both mid- and high- temperature applications. The mid-temperature coatings are used mainly for solar hot water and industrial process heat applications, whereas, the high- temperature absorber coatings are used in concentrating solar power systems for solar thermal power generation. It is well recognized that in order to increase the efficiency of solar thermal power plants, solar selective coatings with high thermal stability are required. In recent years, significant efforts {{have been made in the}} field of solar selective coatings to achieve high solar absorptance and low thermal emittance at higher temperatures (T  400 C). Transition metal based cermets have emerged as novel high temperature solar selective coatings, which are currently being used for solar thermal power plants for electricity generation.
