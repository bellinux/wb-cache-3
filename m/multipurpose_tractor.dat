50|$|The {{idea of a}} heavy <b>multipurpose</b> <b>tractor,</b> {{intended}} for the prepared invasion of the Soviet Union supposedly came from Adolf Hitler. In 1941 Ferdinand Porsche prepared a design of a four-wheel drive tractor, distinguished by its large diameter (1500 mm) steel cleated wheels. The vehicle was powered by Porsche's own design air-cooled, inline-four petrol engine of 6023 cc displacement. As a starter, a two-cylinder petrol engine (half of KdF-Wagen engine) was used.|$|E
40|$|Universal tractor {{transmission}} oil (UTTO) is <b>multipurpose</b> <b>tractor</b> oil formulated {{for use in}} transmissions, final drives, wet brakes and hydraulic systems of tractors employing a common oil reservoir. In the present work, {{the results of a}} series of tests performed to evaluate vegetable based oils a represented. Tribological properties of formulated rapeseed and high oleic sunflower based UTTO were investigated in the standard and non-standard test procedures and compared with the properties of commercially available synthetic and mineral UTTO. Performances of test oils were demonstrated by using SRV high frequency test device, four-ball test rig, and FZG spur gear test rig. For final tests a laboratory hydraulic system and a spur gear test rig were used...|$|E
50|$|BCS {{was founded}} in 1943 by Luigi Castoldi in his {{workshop}} in Abbiategrasso, a small town near Milan. The area {{was and still is}} highly agricultural. For this reason the motor-mower (essentially an engine-driven, walk-behind sickle-bar mower) model 243 was created. This was among the first self-propelled motor-mowers in the world. At the end of the 1960s BCS entered into a technology-sharing venture with the Grillo company of Italy, the goal being to integrate soil-working implements into the BCS line. This venture lasted until the early 1980s, and served to launch BCS into the field of green maintenance machines by producing their first “light” <b>multipurpose</b> two-wheel <b>tractors.</b> Starting in 1970, BCS introduced rotary disc-mowers (for 4-wheel tractor mounting). In 1988 BCS purchased Ferrari at Luzzara and in 1999 BCS purchased Pasquali at Calenzano; these acquisitions strengthened BCS Group's divisions with two brands with an international reputation, and since Ferrari and Pasquali produced 4-wheel tractors, these purchases allowed BCS to move into the 4-wheel tractor market. BCS Group presently counts on three production plants (Abbiategrasso, Luzzara, and Cusago) and on six branches.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} socio-economic {{factors influencing}} power tiller use among sawah farmers in Bida, Nigeria. This {{is based on}} the fact few units of power tillers were imported for lowland rice cultivation. The power tiller is a <b>multipurpose</b> hand <b>tractor</b> designed primarily for rotary tilling and other operations on small farms. The study was carried out in Niger state, Nigeria, and a list of rice farmers in the villages where sawah technology was disseminated was compiled with a total of 2064 farmers. The availability of power tiller is a prerequisite for the adoption of sawah rice production technology. A simple random sampling technique was used to select 200 farmers, and data were collected on their socio-economic variables and power tiller use. Descriptive statistics was used to analyze the socio-economic features of the farmers while the probit model was used to capture the socio-economic factors influencing the use of power tillers among rice growing farmers. The results show that majority of the farmers are about 42 years of age with quranic form of education, belonging to at least one farmers group and have been farming for about 12 years. The land tenure system is predominantly through inheritance. The respondents are predominantly practicing sawah, and power tiller use among the respondents is about 85 percent. Important socio-economic characteristics that are of crucial concern in the introduction of power tiller to sawah adopting farmers are age, educational level, membership of farmer group, farm size, land tenure, practice sawah, location/distance of sawah plot and cost of power tiller use...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The power tiller is a <b>multipurpose</b> hand <b>tractor</b> {{designed}} {{primarily for}} rotary tilling and other farm operations. Vibration, transmitted from the handles of the tiller to the operators’ body, causes many injuries such as, pain, musculoskeletal disorders and white finger syndrome. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the hand-arm vibration exposure in the operators of tiller model HT 900, as the most frequently used model of tillers.. Material and Method: In this study, 40 operators tiller of model HT 900 in the city of Kashmar, Khorasan Razavi were examined. Hand-arm vibration measurement was done according to ISO 5349 - 1 and ISO 5349 - 2 in three different modes including, static and neutral (mode), transition to the ground mode and plowing the land mode in different gears. In order to measure the vibrations, human response vibration meter of B and K model 2512 was utilized [...] Result: Results of the present study indicated that in all measured situations, exposure to hand arm vibration was higher than the standard limit suggested by Iranian occupational health committee and there was risk of vibration-induced disorders. The maximum exposure to vibration is in plowing ground. Exposure to hand arm vibration in three modes of plowing, transmission and natural, were respectively 16. 95, 14. 16 and 8. 65 meters per second squared. Additionally, in all situations, vibration exposure was highest in the X-axis in comparison with Z- and Y-axes.. Conclusion: This study emphasizes on the need to provide intervention and controlling and managing strategies in order to eliminate or reduce vibration transmitted from tiller to operators hand and arm and also prevent to serious problems including neurovascular disorders, discomfort and white finger syndrome. Meanwhile, more studies are necessary to identify the sources of vibration on different models of tiller...|$|R
