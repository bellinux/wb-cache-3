40|$|Here we give two {{examples}} of low-latitude plasma blobs accompanied by linearly polarized perpendicular <b>magnetic</b> <b>deflections</b> which imply that associated field-aligned currents (FACs) have a 2 -D sheet structure located at the blob walls. The estimated FAC density is {{of the order of}} 0. 1 &mu;A/m 2 . The direction of <b>magnetic</b> <b>deflections</b> points westward of the magnetic meridian and there is a linear correlation between perpendicular and parallel variations. All these properties {{are similar to those of}} equatorial plasma bubbles (EPBs). According to CHAMP observations from August 2000 to July 2004, blobs show except for these two good examples no clear signatures of 2 -D FAC sheets at the walls. Generally, perpendicular <b>magnetic</b> <b>deflections</b> inside blobs are weaker than inside EPBs on average. Our results are consistent with existing theories: if a blob exists, (1) a significant part of EPB FAC will be closed through it, exhibiting similar perpendicular <b>magnetic</b> <b>deflection</b> inside EPBs and blobs, (2) the FAC closure through blobs leads to smaller perpendicular <b>magnetic</b> <b>deflection</b> at its poleward/downward side, and (3) superposition of different FAC elements might result in a complex magnetic signature around blobs...|$|R

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{considers the}} design methodologies {{associated with the}} development and optimization of a <b>magnetic</b> <b>deflection</b> system for Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) Display Systems. The development of a <b>magnetic</b> <b>deflection</b> system and the calculations necessary to determine the associated performance are both complex tasks. Their complexity arises from the detailed geometry involved in deflection unit designs, {{the wide range of}} product types and sizes, and variability in product performance specifications. The large variations of these issues compound the difficulty in realising an acceptable product design. Software simulation techniques which are able to accurately manipulate data and perform iterative calculations greatly aid this process. This work introduces a simulation technique used within the Philips organisation, called DUCAD (Deflection Unit Computer Aided Design), which is used to analytically and numerically model the deflection system, with the objective of assessing and speedily realising a design. The simulation technique allows <b>magnetic</b> <b>deflection</b> product designs to be synthesized by simulating the magnetic field generated by the deflection system. Approximate solutions can be iteratively investigated leading to a greater understanding of the problem domain. To gain a degree of confidence with the simulation results the software design proposal is thereafter replicated in hardware allowing a full validation of the DUCAD. Extensive simulation studies and practical prototyping experiments are presented to support the theoretical development. Comparing the calculated theoretical performance and the actual measured values, conclusions are drawn as {{to the quality of the}} simulation tool in deriving the intrinsic <b>magnetic</b> <b>deflection</b> characteristics of the generated product design. The level of agreement of theoretical prediction and experimental results are defined, and the design methodologies required to yield a slot based deflection system are assessed...|$|R

40|$|Field-aligned {{currents}} (FACs) generate <b>magnetic</b> <b>deflections</b> {{perpendicular to}} the ambient Earth magnetic field. We investigate the characteristics of FACs associated with equatorial plasma bubbles (EPBs) as deduced from magnetic field measurements by the CHAMP satellite. Meridional <b>magnetic</b> <b>deflections</b> inside EPBs show a clear hemispheric anti-symmetry for events observed before 21 : 00 LT: inward in the Northern Hemisphere and outward in the Southern Hemisphere. When an eastward electric field is assumed the magnetic signature signifies a Poynting flux directed downward along the magnetic field lines. This means that FACs are driven by a high-altitude equatorial source. Such a scheme cannot be drawn as strictly from our observations after 22 : 00 LT, possibly because of a westward turning of the electric field inside EPBs and/or a decay of EPBs later at night. The perpendicular <b>magnetic</b> <b>deflection</b> is tilted by 40 &deg; from the magnetic meridional plane in westward direction, which implies that the depleted volume of EPBs, {{as well as the}} FAC structure, is tilted westward by 40 &deg; above the magnetic equator. The peak-to-peak amplitude of the FAC density is found to range typically between 0. 1 – 0. 5 μA/m 2 .

40|$|One of the {{long-term}} goals of cluster science research is to synthesize chemically inert, particularly stable cluster species with specific properties {{that can be used}} as advanced materials in nanotechnology applications. Bimetallic clusters are promising as building blocks of these advanced materials, since they offer possibilities to engineer their stability, magnetism, and other properties by manipulating size, shape, and composition. In this regard, numerous studies of (transition) metal doped simple metal clusters as a function of size and composition have provided a wealth of data with wide-ranging interest in various areas of physics and chemistry. Nevertheless, a more challenging question is how the cluster stability and magnetism develop in more complex systems, such as transition metal doped transition metal clusters; this has not been well understood yet. This thesis work intends to provide a better understanding of such questions. In particular, we studied bimetallic (Pb nAl+, Co nTM+, with n = 7 &# 8722; 18 and TM = Ti, V, Cr, Mn) and bimetallic oxide (Co n &# 8722; 1 CrO m + with n = 1 &# 8722; 4 and m = 2 &# 8722; 8) clusters experimentallyusing photofragmentation mass spectrometry and investigated some selected species computationally by density-functional theory. The size- and composition-dependent cluster properties, more in particular the dissociation behavior, stability, structure, and bond strength are investigated. Relative stabilities of the clusters are extracted from the size-dependent photofragmentation spectra. Constraints imposed by the statistical model combined with the available measured laser fluence-dependent photofragmentationspectra are used to bracket dissociation energies. Cluster structures and dissociation energies of some selected sizes are calculated for comparison. It is shown that the relative stability and dissociation behavior of bimetallic clusters are dopant-dependent and generally governed by dimer binding energies. Exceptionally stable 13 -atom clusters can be created by introducing an appropriate dopant atom. The magnetism of free clusters has been investigated essentially using the Stern-Gerlach <b>magnetic</b> <b>deflection</b> technique. Nevertheless, only a few setups have been developed so far with challenges in studying magnetic properties of bimetallic clusters. The second goal of this thesis is devoted to develop a new Stern-Gerlach <b>magnetic</b> <b>deflection</b> setup. By using a unique combination of a binary cluster source, a <b>magnetic</b> <b>deflection</b> system, and a time-resolved position-sensitive detector, it is possible to measure the <b>magnetic</b> <b>deflection</b> of bimetallic clusters. A number of experimental tests were performed to characterize the instrument. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>deflection</b> of Cr atoms is measured successfully.
