5|$|In 2000, an {{estimated}} 45million people were {{infected with the}} beef tapeworm Taenia saginata and 3million with the pork tapeworm Taenia solium. Infection of the digestive system by adult tapeworms causes abdominal symptoms that are unpleasant but not disabling or life-threatening. However, neurocysticercosis resulting from penetration of T. solium larvae into {{the central nervous system}} is the major cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide. In 2000, about 39 million people were infected with trematodes (flukes) that naturally parasitize fish and crustaceans, but can pass to humans who eat raw or lightly cooked seafood. Infection of humans by the broad fish tapeworm Diphyllobothrium latum occasionally causes vitamin B12 deficiency and, in severe cases, <b>megaloblastic</b> anemia.|$|E
25|$|Differences {{lie in the}} {{presentation}} of <b>megaloblastic</b> anemia induced by either folate or B12 deficiency. <b>Megaloblastic</b> anemia related to deficiency in B12 generally results in peripheral neuropathy, whereas folate-related anemia often results in affective, or mood disorders. Neurological effects are not often associated with folate-related <b>megaloblastic</b> anemia, although demyelinating disorders may eventually present. In one study, mood disturbances were recorded {{for the majority of}} patients presenting with <b>megaloblastic</b> anemia in the absence of B12 deficiency. In addition, folate concentrations within blood plasma {{have been found to be}} lower in patients with both unipolar and bipolar depressive disorders when compared with control groups. In addition, depressive groups with low folate concentrations responded less well to standard antidepressant therapy than did those with normal levels within plasma. However, replication of these findings are less robust.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin B12 {{deficiency}} {{is potentially}} extremely serious, leading to <b>megaloblastic</b> anemia, nerve degeneration and irreversible neurological damage.|$|E

25|$|Nucleated {{red blood}} cells in mammals consist of two forms: normoblasts, which are normal erythropoietic {{precursors}} to mature {{red blood cells}}, and megaloblasts, which are abnormally large precursors that occur in <b>megaloblastic</b> anemias.|$|E
25|$|Folate {{deficiency}} {{most commonly}} arises from insufficient folate intake from the diet, {{but may also}} stem from inefficient absorption or metabolic utilization of folate, usually a result of genetic variation. The relationship between folate and B12 is so interdependent that deficiency in either vitamin can result in <b>megaloblastic</b> anemia, characterized by organic mental change.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to increasing {{the risk of}} <b>megaloblastic</b> anemia, primidone, like other older anticonvulsants also {{increases the risk of}} neural tube defects, and like other enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants, it increases the likelihood of cardiovascular defects, and cleft lip without cleft palate. Epileptic women are generally advised to take folic acid, but there is conflicting evidence regarding the effectiveness of vitamin supplementation in the prevention of such defects.|$|E
25|$|Another health {{implication}} is {{the depletion of}} folate within the body, where the overexposure to UV light can lead to <b>megaloblastic</b> anemia. Folate deficiency in pregnant women can be detrimental {{to the health of}} their newborn babies in the form of neural tube defects, miscarriages, and spina bifida, a birth defect in which the backbone and spinal canal do not close before birth. The peak of neural tube defect occurrences is the highest in the May–June period in the Northern Hemisphere. Folate is needed for DNA replication in dividing cells and deficiency can lead to failures of normal embryogenesis and spermatogenesis.|$|E
25|$|Common causes include poor {{absorption}} {{from the}} stomach or intestines, decreased intake, and increased requirements. Decreased absorption {{may be due}} to pernicious anemia, surgical removal of the stomach, chronic inflammation of the pancreas, intestinal parasites, certain medications, and some genetic disorders. Decreased intake may occur in those who eat a vegan diet or are malnourished. Increased requirements occur in HIV/AIDS and in those with rapid red blood cell breakdown. Diagnosis is typically based on vitamin B12 blood levels below 120–180 picomol/L (170–250 pg/mL) in adults. Elevated methylmalonic acid levels (values >0.4 micromol/L) may also indicate a deficiency. A type of low red blood cells known as <b>megaloblastic</b> anemia is often but not always present.|$|E
25|$|Once the IF/B12 {{complex is}} {{recognized}} by specialized ileal receptors, it is transported into the portal circulation. The vitamin is {{then transferred to}} transcobalamin II (TC-II/B12), which serves as the plasma transporter. Hereditary defects in production of the transcobalamins and their receptors may produce functional deficiencies in B12 and infantile <b>megaloblastic</b> anemia, and abnormal B12 related biochemistry, even in some cases with normal blood B12 levels. For the vitamin to serve inside cells, the TC-II/B12 complex must bind to a cell receptor, and be endocytosed. The transcobalamin-II is degraded within a lysosome, and free B12 is finally released into the cytoplasm, where it may be transformed into the proper coenzyme, by certain cellular enzymes (see above).|$|E
25|$|H2-receptor antagonists: include {{cimetidine}} (Tagamet), famotidine (Pepcid), nizatidine (Axid), and ranitidine (Zantac). Reduced secretion of {{gastric acid}} and pepsin produced by H2 blockers can reduce absorption of protein-bound (dietary) vitamin B12, {{but not of}} supplemental vitamin B12. Gastric acid is needed to release vitamin B12 from protein for absorption. Clinically significant vitamin B12 deficiency and <b>megaloblastic</b> anemia are unlikely, unless H2 blocker therapy is prolonged (2 years or more), or the person's diet is poor. It is also more likely {{if the person is}} rendered achlorhydric(with complete absence of gastric acid secretion), which occurs more frequently with proton pump inhibitors than H2 blockers. Vitamin B12 levels should be monitored in people taking high doses of H2 blockers for prolonged periods.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, a Dr. Meadow {{encountered}} six {{babies with}} cleft lip and palate {{in addition to}} other congenital abnormalities whose mothers had been taking anticonvulsants. Meadow wrote a letter in The Lancet asking for cases of cleft lip and palate in babies whose mothers had taken anticonvulsants. That same year, Milunsky, Graef, and Gaynor reported cases of cleft lip and palate associated with attempted abortion with methotrexate and aminopterin, which are folic acid antagonists. While it was widely accepted by 1969 that these drugs could interfere with folic acid and that folic acid supplementation might have beneficial somatic effects, it was believed that folic acid supplementation could exacerbate seizures; this included the routine supplements given to pregnant women to prevent <b>megaloblastic</b> anemia. By 1970, the doctor had collected thirty-two cases. Sixteen of them were born to women taking primidone. 25% of the thirty-two cases had congenital heart defects; the reported rate in cleft lip and palate was 3-5%. Meadow emphasized that there was no proof of an association, the immense value of anticonvulsants and the probably small odds of any one epileptic woman having a child with a congenital abnormality. Roman and Caratzali reported in 1971 that the offspring of mice treated with primidone had more abnormal bone metaphases than controls; this was due to chromosomal lesions. By the mid-1970s, it was obvious that this antagonistic effect of primidone was not due to the inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase, the enzyme responsible for the reduction of dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid, but rather to defective folate metabolism.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first report}} associating it with <b>megaloblastic</b> anemia came in 1954 from Drs. Chalmers and Boheimer. [...] Between 1954 and 1957, twenty-one cases of <b>megaloblastic</b> anemia {{associated}} with primidone and/or phenytoin were reported. Most cases {{were due to}} folic acid deficiency; however, there was one that only responded to B12 therapy and one that required Vitamin C. Some cases were associated with deficient diets; one patient ate mostly bread and butter, another ate bread, buns, and hard candy, and another could rarely be persuaded {{to eat in the}} hospital. The idea that folic acid deficiency could cause <b>megaloblastic</b> anemia was not new. What was new was the idea that drugs could cause this in well-nourished people with no intestinal abnormalities. In many cases, it was not clear which drug had caused it. It was speculated that this might be related to the structural similarity between folic acid, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and primidone. Folic acid had been found to alleviate the symptoms of <b>megaloblastic</b> anemia in the 1940s, not long after it was discovered, but the typical patient only made a full recoverycessation of CNS and PNS symptoms as well as anemiaon B12 therapy. Five years earlier, folic acid deficiency was linked to birth defects in rats. Primidone was seen by some as too valuable to withhold based on the slight possibility of this rare side effect and by others as dangerous enough to be withheld unless phenobarbital or some other barbiturate failed to work for this and other reasons (i.e., reports of permanent psychosis.|$|E
2500|$|Patients with {{bacterial}} overgrowth that is longstanding can develop complications of their illness {{as a result}} of malabsorption of nutrients. Anemia may occur from a variety of mechanisms, as many of the nutrients involved in production of red blood cells are absorbed in the affected small bowel. [...] Iron is absorbed in the more proximal parts of the small bowel, the duodenum and jejunum, and patients with malabsorption of iron can develop a microcytic anemia, with small red blood cells. Vitamin B12 is absorbed in {{the last part of the}} small bowel, the ileum, and patients who malabsorb vitamin B12 can develop a <b>megaloblastic</b> anemia with large red blood cells.|$|E
2500|$|Riboflavin {{deficiency}} (also called ariboflavinosis) {{results in}} stomatitis including painful red tongue with sore throat, chapped and fissured lips (cheilosis), and {{inflammation of the}} corners of the mouth (angular stomatitis). [...] There can be oily scaly skin rashes on the scrotum, vulva, philtrum of the lip, or the nasolabial folds. [...] The eyes can become itchy, watery, bloodshot and sensitive to light. [...] Due to interference with iron absorption, even mild to moderate riboflavin deficiency results in an anemia with normal cell size and normal hemoglobin content (i.e. normochromic normocytic anemia). [...] This is distinct from anemia caused by deficiency of folic acid (B9) or cyanocobalamin (B12), which causes anemia with large blood cells (<b>megaloblastic</b> anemia). Deficiency of riboflavin during pregnancy can result in birth defects including congenital heart defects and limb deformities.|$|E
2500|$|The HGPRT {{deficiency}} {{causes a}} build-up of uric acid in all body fluids. [...] The combination of increased synthesis and decreased utilization of purines leads {{to high levels}} of uric acid production. This results in both hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria, associated with severe gout and kidney problems. [...] Neurological signs include poor muscle control and moderate intellectual disability. [...] These complications usually appear {{in the first year of}} life. [...] Beginning in the second year of life, a particularly striking feature of LNS is self-mutilating behaviors, characterized by lip and finger biting. Neurological symptoms include facial grimacing, involuntary writhing, and repetitive movements of the arms and legs similar to those seen in Huntington's disease. The etiology of the neurological abnormalities remains unknown. Because a lack of HGPRT causes the body to poorly utilize vitamin B12, some boys may develop <b>megaloblastic</b> anemia.|$|E
2500|$|Vitamin B12 is a {{bacterial}} product needed for cell division, {{the formation and}} maturation of red blood cells, the synthesis of DNA, and normal nerve function. A deficiency may cause <b>megaloblastic</b> anaemia and neurological damage, and, if untreated, may lead to death. (Cobalamin)", The Dietitian's Guide to Vegetarian Diets, Jones & Bartlett Learning, 2011, [...] The high content of folacin in vegetarian diets may mask the hematological symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency, so it may go undetected until neurological signs in the late stages are evident, which can be irreversible, such as neuropsychiatric abnormalities, neuropathy, dementia and, occasionally, atrophy of optic nerves. Vegans sometimes fail to obtain enough B12 from their diet because among non-fortified foods, only those of animal origin contain sufficient amounts. The best source is ruminant food. Vegetarians are also at risk, as are older people and those with certain medical conditions. A 2013 study found that [...] "vegetarians develop B12 depletion or deficiency regardless of demographic characteristics, place of residency, age, or type of vegetarian diet. Vegans should take preventive measures to ensure adequate intake of this vitamin, including regular consumption of supplements containing B12." ...|$|E
2500|$|MTR, {{also known}} as {{methionine}} synthase, is a methyltransferase enzyme, which uses the MeB12 and reaction type 2 to transfer a methyl group from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine, thereby generating tetrahydrofolate (THF) and methionine (for more see MTR's reaction mechanism). This functionality is lost in vitamin B12 deficiency, resulting in an increased homocysteine level and the trapping of folate as 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate, from which THF (the active form of folate) cannot be recovered. THF {{plays an important role}} in DNA synthesis so reduced availability of THF results in ineffective production of cells with rapid turnover, in particular red blood cells, and also intestinal wall cells which are responsible for absorption. THF may be regenerated via MTR or may be obtained from fresh folate in the diet. Thus all of the DNA synthetic effects of B12 deficiency, including the <b>megaloblastic</b> anemia of pernicious anemia, resolve if sufficient dietary folate is present. Thus the best-known [...] "function" [...] of B12 (that which is involved with DNA synthesis, cell-division, and anemia) is actually a facultative function which is mediated by B12-conservation of an active form of folate which is needed for efficient DNA production.
