40|$|The natural {{immune system}} is a subject of great {{research}} interest because of its powerful information processing capabilities. It uses characteristics such as learning, memory and associative retrieval to solve recognition and classification tasks.

40|$|Type 1 {{diabetes}} {{is caused by}} a progressive autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing B cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. The autoimmune process begins years before the B-cell destruction becomes complete, thereby providing an opportunity for early intervention. Genetic susceptibility markers have been identified and autoantibody assays make possible the identification of individuals at high risk of the disease. Prevention strategies could be implemented in first-degree relatives of type 1 diabetic patients at high risk of developing the disease {{because of the presence of}} several autoantibodies. Alternatively, they may also be considered at time of clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus in order to maintain residual endogenous insulin secretion that markedly contributes to long-term better glycaemic stability. Thus, the goals of prevention are to preserve B cells during the preclinical period and/or after early diagnosis by <b>modifying</b> <b>immunological</b> pathogenic processes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Administration of interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) {{has shown}} some effects on {{malignant}} pleural mesothelioma (MPM) tumour regression. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the ability of IL- 2 to <b>modify</b> <b>immunological</b> effector cells and angiogenesis in MPM patients and their prognostic value. METHODS: Tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (CD 4, CD 8, Foxp 3), mast cells (MCs) (tryptase and chymase), microvessel count (MVC) and VEGF were determined by immunohistochemistry in two series of MPM patients: 60 patients treated with intra-pleural preoperative IL- 2 and 33 patients untreated. RESULTS: Tryptase MCs, and CD 8 and Foxp 3 lymphocytes were significantly increased in the IL- 2 -treated group, whereas MVC was significantly lower in the same group. Moreover, in the IL- 2 -treated group, greater tryptase + MCs and greater Foxp 3 lymphocytes were associated with improved and poorer clinical outcomes, respectively. Notably, when these two immunological parameters were combined, they predicted outcomes more effectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that IL- 2 treatment leads to a significant increase of immunological parameters, concomitantly with a reduction in vasculature, providing new insight into the cancer mechanisms mediated by IL- 2. Moreover, these results suggest that tryptase-positive MCs and Foxp 3 + lymphocytes predict clinical outcomes in IL- 2 -treated patients, highlighting the critical role of the inflammatory response in mesothelioma cancer progression.

Dendritic cells (DC) are the major antigen presenting cells. This study evaluated the antitumor effect of CIK cells which were non-virally transfected with IL- 2 and co-cultured with pulsed and unpulsed DC. Human CIK cells generated from peripheral blood were transfected in vitro with plasmid encoding for the human IL- 2. Transfection involved a combination of electrical parameters and a specific solution to deliver plasmid directly to the cell nucleus by using the Nucleofector® electroporation system.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESWe {{examined}} {{the effect of}} long-term treatment with two doses of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril on various immunological variables in patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). BACKGROUNDImmunological mediators are increasingly recognized to play a pathogenic role in the pathophysiology of CHF. Whether ACE inhibitor therapy <b>modifies</b> <b>immunological</b> variables has not previously been investigated. METHODSSeventy-five patients (mean age 52 ± 11 years) with CHF were randomized between low- (5 mg daily) and high-dose (40 mg daily) enalapril in a double-blind trial. Circulating levels of immunological parameters (i. e., proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules) were measured at baseline, at 10 weeks {{and at the end}} of the study (34 weeks). RESULTSAll immunological parameters, except soluble interleukin (IL) - 6 receptor, were increased in CHF compared with 21 healthy controls. During the study immunoreactive IL- 6 levels decreased (p < 0. 05) and soluble IL- 6 receptor increased (p < 0. 05) during high-dose but not during low-dose enalapril therapy. Furthermore, IL- 6 bioactivity decreased only during the high-dose (p < 0. 001), resulting in a significant difference in change during treatment between the two dosage groups (p < 0. 001). This decrease in IL- 6 bioactivity was significantly associated with decreased interventricular septum thickness as assessed by echocardiography (r = 0. 56, p = 0. 013). No other variables changed during treatment. CONCLUSIONSIn patients with severe CHF, high-dose enalapril therapy is associated with a significant decrease in IL- 6 activity. However, despite treatment with a high-dose ACE inhibitor, a persistent immune activation exists in these patients which may be of importance for the progression of CHF...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The recent great {{advances}} in medical treatment and scientific technology include the many antiviral agents {{that have been}} developed and are used for treatment of infectious diseases, but such advances have also provoked the appear-ance of resistant virus strains. Therefore, the development of new antiviral agents with diverse kinds of antiviral actions is required. The search for new antiviral agents focuses on not only synthetic compounds but also natural products such as traditional medicines, dietary supplements, and functional foods, including plants, insects, animal organs, and their com-ponents. Natural products have their own metabolites, and some of the metabolites may recognize the differences between viral and host metabolisms, resulting in antiviral activity. In general, they can be obtained cheaply and may be useful re-sources to develop new antiviral agents with different antiviral actions from those of known antiviral agents. Also, natural products and their components have been demonstrated to <b>modify</b> <b>immunological</b> activities and are candidates for biological response modifiers that are effective in alleviating symptoms and reducing mortality in virus infection. The first half of this chapter introduces natural products and purified compounds that were confirmed by in vitro experiments and animal infection models to have direct antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) or influenza virus. However, even if a natural product or purified component has strong antiviral activity in vitro, if it has no therapeu-tic efficacy against virus infection in an animal infection model, it is merely an inhibitor and not a medicine. The search for antiviral agents should be based on the demonstration of prophylactic and/or therapeutic efficacy at the proper dosag...|$|R
40|$|Tropomyosin is a {{cross-reactive}} {{allergenic protein}} present in ingested shellfish species. Exposure and sensitization to this protein via inhalation {{is particularly important}} in the crustacean processing industry where workers are continuously exposed to the aerosolized form of this allergen. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop an antibody-based immunoassay to enable the specific and sensitive quantification of aerosolized tropomyosin present in the environment of two crab processing facilities. Anti-tropomyosin antibody was generated in rabbits against tropomyosins from four different crustacean species. These antibodies were purified using recombinant tropomyosin using an immuno-affinity column. The recombinant tropomyosin was also used as an allergen standard for the sandwich ELISA. In order to quantify aerosolized tropomyosin, air collection was performed in the personal breathing zone of 80 workers during two crab processing activities, edible crab (Cancer pagurus) and king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) using polytetrafluoroethylene filters. The purified antibody was able to detect tropomyosin selectively from different crustaceans but not from vertebrate sources. The limit of detection (LOD) for the developed sandwich ELISA was 60 picogram/m(3) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) 100 picogram/m(3). Immunoassay validation was based on linearity (R(2) 0. 999), matrix interference test (78. 8 ± 6. 5 %), intra-assay CV (9. 8 %) and inter-assay CV (11 %). The novel immunoassay was able to successfully identify working activities, which generated low, medium or high concentrations of the aerosolized food allergen. We describe an IgG antibody-based immunoassay for quantification of the major food allergen tropomyosin, with high sensitivity and specificity. This <b>modified</b> <b>immunological</b> approach can be adapted for the detection of other aerosolized food allergens, assisting in the identification of high-risk allergen exposure areas in the food industry...|$|R

Background: The {{stability}} of protein drugs {{remains one of}} the key hurdles to their success in the market. The aim {{of the present study was}} to design a novel nanoemulsion drug-delivery system (NEDDS) that would encapsulate a standard-model protein drug &ndash; bovine serum albumin (BSA) &ndash; to improve drug stability. Methods: The BSA NEDDS was prepared using a phase-inversion method and pseudoternary phase diagrams. The following characteristics were studied: morphology, size, zeta potential, drug loading, and encapsulation efficiency. We also investigated the stability of the BSA NEDDS, bioactivity of BSA encapsulated within the NEDDS, the integrity of the primary, secondary, and tertiary structures, and specificity. Results: The BSA NEDDS consisted of Cremophor EL- 35, propylene glycol, isopropyl myristate, and normal saline. The average particle diameter of the BSA NEDDS was about 21. 8 nm, and the system showed a high encapsulation efficiency (&gt; 90 %) and an adequate drug-loading capacity (45 mg/mL). The thermodynamic stability of the system was investigated at different temperatures and pH levels and in room-temperature conditions for 180 days. BSA NEDDS showed good structural integrity and specificity for the primary, secondary, and tertiary structures, and good bioactivity of the loaded BSA. Conclusions: BSA NEDDS showed the properties of a good nanoemulsion-delivery system. NEDDS can greatly enhance the stability of the protein drug BSA while maintaining high levels of drug bioactivity, good specificity, and integrity of the primary, secondary, and tertiary protein structures. These findings indicate that the nanoemulsion is a potential formulation for oral administration of protein drugs.

40|$|The lungs are {{constantly}} exposed to microbial pathogens and environmental stimuli that can trigger time-limited defense responses, generalized persistent inflammatory response or no response at all. Exposure history has a profound {{influence on the}} nature and level of immune reactivity in the lungs. To date, there is little data on the immediate and long-term changes {{that take place in}} the lungs as a consequence of infection. The work presented here used the Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Nb) mouse model of human hookworm infection to test the hypothesis that nematode infections cause an alteration of the pulmonary environment that in turn dampens subsequent reactivity to allergen. The transient lung phase of Nb was exploited to generate pulmonary inflammation and histological, immunohistocytochemical, flow cytometric and transcriptional analyses were used to evaluate the immediate and persistent molecular and cellular changes in the lungs. The innate responses to Nb were characterized by a dramatic and immediate increase in the transcription of the Th 2 cytokine IL- 13 and a transformation of alveolar macrophages to the alternatively activated phenotype (AAAMs). The <b>modified</b> <b>immunological</b> status of the lungs persisted weeks after the parasite was expelled from the host and included an increase in constitutive transcription of both Th 1 and Th 2 cytokines, the number of AAAMs and airway resistance. Thirty-six days post-infection, lungs were challenged against house dust mite allergen to test the functional consequences of these sustained immunological changes. Nb-infected lungs had a significantly altered transcription profile, a decrease in perivascular eosinophilia and a dampened airway hyperresponsiveness compared to the uninfected controls. In addition, an in vitro culture model of AAAM formation was developed and characterized to determine that Nb is unable to directly induce the AAAM phenotype, but requires an intermediate cell type to trigger the transformation. Previously unrecognized AAAM markers (Cish, Igf 1, Flt 1 and Dtr/Hbegf) were identified in addition to the currently recognized ones (Arg 1, Fizz 1 /Retnla, Ym 1 /Chi 3 l 3, Ym 2 /Chi 3 l 4 and Mrc 1 /CD 206). These results document that a helminth infection induces persistent and significant changes to the immunological environment of the lung. Exploiting naturally induced suppressive mechanisms in a clinical setting might provide new tools for controlling asthma and allergies. ...|$|R

This excessive process may disturb the postoperative course and render reoperations {{more difficult and}} risky.

The scar tissue that forms postoperatively adheres to the dura mater, penetrates into the spinal canal and can cause narrowing symptoms, neurological deficits and pain.

40|$|Normal tissue {{architecture}} is disrupted following injury, as resident tissue cells become damaged and immune cells are recruited {{to the site}} of injury. While injury and inflammation are critical to tissue remodeling, the inability to resolve this response can lead to the destructive complications of chronic inflammation. In the pancreas, acinar cells of the exocrine compartment respond to injury by transiently adopting characteristics of progenitor cells present during embryonic development. This process of de-differentiation creates a window where a mature and stable cell gains flexibility and is potentially permissive to changes in cellular fate. How de-differentiation can turn an acinar cell into another cell type (such as a pancreatic b-cell), or a cell with cancerous potential (as in cases of deregulated Kras activity) is of interest to both the regenerative medicine and cancer communities. While it is known that inflammation and acinar de-differentiation increase following pancreatic injury, it remains unclear which immune cells are involved in this process. We used a combination of genetically <b>modified</b> mice, <b>immunological</b> blockade and cellular characterization to identify the immune cells that impact pancreatic regeneration in an in vivomodel of pancreatitis. We identified the innate inflammatory response of macrophages and neutrophils as regulators of pancreatic regeneration. Under normal conditions, mild innate inflammation prompts a transient de-differentiation of acinar cells that readily dissipates to allow normal regeneration.

In a retrospective cohort study, we assessed {{the relationship between}} autoimmune disorders and actual gluten exposure in patients in whom coeliac disease was diagnosed in adult life (⩾ 16 years).  METHODS—We screened {{for the presence of}} autoimmunity in 605  controls (16 - 84 years) and 422  patients (16 - 84 years), all of whom had been on gluten withdrawal for at least one year (median follow up 9. 5  years). A logistic regression analysis, setting the prevalence of autoimmunity as the dependent variable, was employed to control for independent covariates as predictors of the risk of autoimmunity.  RESULTS—The prevalence of autoimmunity was threefold higher (p< 0. 00001) in patients than in controls. Mean duration of gluten exposure was 31. 2  and 32. 6  years for patients with or without autoimmunity. Logistic regression showed that increased age at diagnosis of coeliac disease was related to the prevalence of autoimmune disease while "actual gluten exposure" which takes into account diet compliance, follow up, and age at diagnosis of autoimmune disorders were not predictive for the risk of developing autoimmune diseases (odds ratio 0. 82  per year).  CONCLUSION—The prevalence of autoimmune diseases in patients with a late coeliac disease diagnosis does not correlate with duration of gluten intake.

40|$|ABSTRACTChanges in virological and {{immunological}} parameters were analysed following structured intermittent {{interruption of}} highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) {{of patients with}} chronic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Parameters analysed were serum levels of the CD 8 + T-cellderived inhibitory molecules interleukin- 16 (IL- 16), monocyte inhibitory protein- 1 β (MIP- 1 β) and RANTES (‘regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and presumably secreted'), and the enhancer of HIV replication, monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 (MCP- 1). Twenty-five patients with chronic HIV infection were evaluated during three cycles of intermittent interruptions of therapy (8 weeks on/ 4 weeks off) in comparison with 20 healthy sex-and age-matched controls. At enrolment, HIV-infected patients showed significantly higher serum concentrations of IL- 16 and RANTES, and significantly lower concentrations of MCP- 1, than did healthy controls. Levels of MIP- 1 β were similar in both groups. Only the serum levels of IL- 16 increased significantly in HIV-infected patients after every treatment interruption. However, differences between the CD 4 + or CD 8 + T-cell counts/μL, HIV loads and serum concentrations of each cytokine at baseline {{and at the end}} of the three cycles of intermittent interruptions of therapy were not significant. It was concluded that structured intermittent interruption of HAART for patients with chronic HIV infection did not <b>modify</b> the <b>immunological</b> parameters, including serum levels of CD 8 + T-cell-derived inhibitory molecules, or the virus parameters studied. Thus, the findings do not support the use of this treatment modality for the management of HIV-infected patients...|$|R
40|$|Filarial {{nematode}} parasites establish long-term chronic {{infections in}} the context of an antiparasite immunity that is strongly biased toward a Th 2 response. The mechanisms that lead to this Th 2 bias toward filarial antigens are not clear, but one possibility is that the parasites produce molecules that have the capacity to proactively <b>modify</b> their <b>immunological</b> environment. Here we report that filarial parasites of humans secrete a homologue of the human proinflammatory cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) that has the capability of modifying the activity of human monocytes/macrophages. A cDNA clone isolated from a Brugia malayi infective-stage larva expression library encoded a 12. 5 -kDa protein product (Bm-MIF) with 42 % identity to human and murine MIF. MIF homologues were also found to be expressed in the related filarial species Wuchereria bancrofti and Onchocerca volvulus. Bm-mif was transcribed by adult and larval parasites, and the protein product was found in somatic extracts and in the parasite’s excretory-secretory products. Immunohistocytochemistry revealed that Bm-MIF was localized to cells of the hypodermis/lateral chord, the uterine wall, and larvae developing in utero. Unexpectedly, the activities of recombinant Bm-MIF and human MIF on human monocytes/macrophages were found to be similar. When placed with monocytes/macrophages in a cell migration assay, Bm-MIF inhibited random migration. When placed away from cells, Bm-MIF induced an increase in monocyte/macrophage migration that was specifically inhibited by neutralizing anti-Bm-MIF antibodies. Bm-MIF is the first demonstration that helminth parasites produce cytokine homologues that have the potential to modify host immune responses to promote parasite survival...|$|R
40|$|The {{aging of}} the immune system is a gradual and dynamic process that <b>modifies</b> some <b>immunological</b> functions. These changes are known as “immunosenescence” that have a great impact on immune {{performance}} in late life, contributing to the decreased ability of the elderly people to respond to emerging pathogens and to the decreased responsiveness to vaccinations. It is known that the adaptive immune functions are affected in the aged. In particular, with aging, the acquired compartment {{of the immune system}} shows significant modifications in both T and B cell branches. Thus, the adaptive immune response of elderly people is qualitatively and quantitatively reduced when compared to that observed in young people. Lifelong and chronic antigenic load are the major driving forces of this process that is associated with a general increase in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory molecules that render elderly people prone to frailty and susceptible to major age-related diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). On the other hand, centenarians represent an example of successful aging because they have delayed diseases that normally cause mortality in the general population. The aim of this thesis is to study changes in immune system with age, also focusing on people genetically advantaged for healthy ageing (Centenarian Offspring) or unsuccessfully aged patients (Alzheimer’s Disease), paying attention principally on the naïve/memory B cell compartments. The presented data suggest that the study of naïve/memory B and T cell compartments may be relevant in the evaluation of biological ageing of the immune system...|$|R
40|$|Surfactant {{proteins}} are {{of major}} {{importance for the}} stabi-lity and flexibility of lipid systems like the lung surfactant or the tear film. They can support the adsorption of phospholipids into a layer or specifically influence the surface tension of a lipid surface [1]. To fulfil these func-tions, they are described to be highly posttranslationally <b>modified.</b> Furthermore, <b>immunological</b> functions were described {{for some of the}} already known surfactant pro-teins SP-A, SP-B, SP-C and SP-D [2]. For that reason, they are of great interest in the investigation of diseases like the “acute respiratory distress syndrome ” (ARDS) or the “dry eye syndrome ” (DES). Recently sequences of two putative surfactant proteins, called SP-G and SP-H, were identified. To get insights into the function of SP-G and SP-H, protein structure models were generated, including predictions for posttranslational modifications. These models successfully guided the design of antibodies for the localization of SP-G and SP-H in different human tis-sues, including lung and ocular system. Both protein models were transferred into a lung surfactant model sys-tem consisting of a dipalmitoyl¬phosphatidyl¬choline monolayer. MD simulations over 50 ns were performed with GROMACS starting from different orientations of the protein models. During these simulations, it was pos-sible to track the accumulation of the proteins to the lipid layer and observe the interactions between protein surface and lipid head groups on an atomic scale. The results show that SP-G and SP-H indeed are capable of surface-regulatory properties. Furthermore, it is evident that the interaction between proteins and lipid systems is highly dependent on the present posttranslational modifi-cations. In combination with further experimental work, these simulations can help to determine the functions o...|$|R
40|$|Objective]: The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the effect of Holder pasteurisation of human colostrum {{on a variety of}} microbiological, biochemical, and immunological parameters. [Methods]: Colostrum samples from 10 donors, and 8 samples of mature milk used as controls, were heated at 62. 5 C for 30 minutes. Bacterial counts and the concentration of furosine, lactose, myoinositol, glucose, lactulose, cytokines, and immunoglobulins were determined before and after the heat treatment. [Results]: Mean bacterial counts in nonpasteurised colostrum samples oscillated between 2. 72 and 4. 13 log 10 colony-forming units per millilitre in the agar media tested. Holder pasteurisation led to the destruction of the bacteria originally present in the samples. Furosine was detected in all samples before pasteurisation and increased significantly after the heat treatment (from 6. 60 to 20. 59 mg/ 100 g protein). Lactulose content was below the detection limit in nonpasteurised colostrum, but it was detected in all samples and quantified in 7 of them (from 10. 68 to 38. 02 mg/L) after Holder pasteurisation. Lactose, glucose, and myoinositol concentrations did not change after Holder pasteurisation. The concentrations of most cytokines and immunoglobulins were significantly higher in colostrum than in mature milk samples. Immunoglobulin content, both in colostrum and in milk samples, was reduced during pasteurisation, whereas, among cytokines, only macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 β, interleukin- 7, and granulocyte-macrophage-colony- stimulating factor concentrations were affected by this heat treatment. [Conclusions]: Lactulose and furosine content could be used as heat treatment indicators in colostrum samples. Holder pasteurisation <b>modified</b> the <b>immunological</b> profile of both colostrum and mature milk.

40|$|BACKGROUND: We have {{previously}} shown that allogeneic bone marrow (BM) chimeras preconditioned with total lymphoid irradiation and low-dose {{total body irradiation}} (TLI/TBI) develop a stronger graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect than chimeras preconditioned with high-dose total body irradiation only (TBI). Here, {{we report on the}} possible role of cytokines in the mechanism underlying this GVL effect. METHODS: Splenic mRNA levels of the cytokines interleukin (IL) - 1, IL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 6, IL- 7, IL- 10, IL- 12, IL- 15, interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), and of inducible nitric oxide synthetase were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in TLI/TBI- or TBI-conditioned C 3 H/AKR BM chimeras challenged with AKR-type BW 5147. 3 leukemia cells. Ex vivo TGF-beta protein production by splenocytes was determined using ELISA. The possibility that cytokines influence the GVL effect by modulating the activity of IL- 2 -activated lymphocytes (LAK cells) was investigated by in vitro assays on donor-type BM cells. RESULTS: Of all cytokine mRNA levels studied, those of TGF-beta and IL- 7 were different between groups; both were significantly more elevated in TBI- than in TLI/ TBI-conditioned or normal mice. Differences were apparent after conditioning and were not influenced by additionally injected BM or leukemia cells. Cultured splenocytes of TBI-conditioned animals produced significantly more TGF-beta protein than those of TLI/TBI-conditioned ones or normal controls. r-TGF-beta but not r-IL- 7 suppressed in vitro LAK activity of donor-type BM cells against BW 5147. 3 cells in a dose-dependent way. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose TBI-induced, host-derived splenic TGF-beta may inhibit generation of LAK cells from subsequently transplanted donor BM cells, suppressing their capacity to generate cytotoxicity upon injection of leukemia cells. The cytokine profile, induced by irradiation in host hematopoietic organs, can significantly <b>modify</b> posttransplant <b>immunological</b> processes such as the GVL effect and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Tuberculosis {{is still}} one of the most deadly {{infectious}} diseases worldwide, and the use of conjugated antigens, obtained by combining antigenic oligosaccharides, such as the lipoarabinomannane (LAM), with antigenic proteins from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), has been proposed as a new strategy for developing efficient vaccines. In this work, we investigated the effect of the chemical glycosylation on two recombinant MTB proteins produced in E. coli with an additional seven-amino acid tag (recombinant Ag 85 B and TB 10. 4). Different semi-synthetic glycoconjugated derivatives were prepared, starting from mannose and two disaccharide analogs. The glycans were activated at the anomeric position with a thiocyanomethyl group, as required for protein glycosylation by selective reaction with lysines. The glycosylation sites and the ex vivo evaluation of the immunogenic activity of the different neo-glycoproteins were investigated. Glycosylation does not <b>modify</b> the <b>immunological</b> activity of the TB 10. 4 protein. Similarly, Ag 85 B maintains its B-cell activity after glycosylation while showing a significant reduction in the T-cell response. The results were correlated with the putative B- and T-cell epitopes, predicted using a combination of in silico systems. In the recombinant TB 10. 4, the unique lysine is not included in any T-cell epitope. Lys 30 of Ag 85 B, identified as the main glycosylation site, proved to be the most important site involved in the formation of T-cell epitopes, reasonably explaining why its glycosylation strongly influenced the T-cell activity. Furthermore, additional lysines included in different epitopes (Lys 103, - 123 and - 282) are also glycosylated. In contrast, B-cell epitopic lysines of Ag 85 B were found to be poorly glycosylated and, thus, the antibody interaction of Ag 85 B was only marginally affected after coupling with mono- or disaccharides...|$|R
