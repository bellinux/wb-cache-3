5|$|Questions then arose {{among the}} U.S. {{administration}} and military leadership {{as to the}} best method by which Hanoi (the perceived locus of the insurgency) could be dissuaded from its course of action. The answer seemed to lie {{in the application of}} air power. By 1964 most of the civilians surrounding President Lyndon B. Johnson shared the Joint Chiefs of Staff's collective faith in the efficacy of strategic bombing to one degree or another. They reasoned that a small nation like North Vietnam, with a tiny industrial base that was just emerging after the First Indochina War, would be reluctant to risk its new-found economic viability to support the insurgency in the south. Constantly affecting this decision-making process were fears of possible counter moves or outright intervention by the Soviet Union, the PRC, or both. The civilians and the military were divided, however, on the manner of affecting Hanoi's will to support the southern insurgency. The civilians thought in terms of changing the regime's behavior while the military <b>men</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> concerned with breaking its will.|$|E

25|$|According to {{results from}} the fifth wave of the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study, which interviewed over 14,000 people about their sexual orientation, 94.2% of New Zealanders {{identify}} as heterosexual, 2.6% as gay or lesbian, 1.8% as bisexual, 0.6% as bicurious, 0.5% as pansexual, and 0.3% as asexual.

25|$|It {{was enacted}} at the {{parliament}} assembled in Forfar in 1057 by King Malcolm Canmore that every baron should erect a gibbet for {{the execution of}} male criminals, and sink a well or pit, for the drowning of females. The term pit and gallows described the jurisdiction of a Baron in criminal cases; in full 'pit and gallows, sake and soke, toll, team, and infangthief'. A pit, according to Mackenzie {{was a form of}} dungeon or prison cell, not a pit for drowning the condemned. Others take the view that the pit was the drowning pool for women and the gallows for the men. It is not clear why <b>men</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely to be hanged and women drowned in a fen, river, pit or 'murder hole', however it may relate to ideas of decency. The place name 'Muttonhole' is not infrequently found and one suggestion is that it is derived from 'Mort-toun-hole', another of the names for a hollow where women were drowned.|$|E
25|$|Many gay men {{and lesbians}} had children, {{especially}} if they had been previously married. Over 50 per cent of homosexuals who had been married had children. When they asked homosexuals whether they would be disturbed if their own children became homosexual, between 25 and 33 per cent said yes. Between 69 and 77 per cent said {{that they would not be}} upset, or only a little upset, if one of their children became homosexual. Compared to heterosexuals, homosexuals were much less likely to marry: 25 per cent of homosexuals married and 75 per cent did not, while for heterosexuals, the proportions were roughly reversed. When homosexuals did marry, they had less heterosexual intercourse and fewer children than heterosexuals. Some other findings were that 1 per cent of gay men were attracted to feminine qualities in a man, that gay men had little interest in competitive sport, and that older gay <b>men</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely than younger gay men to concentrate on fellatio. Bell and Weinberg were unable to explain the finding about sport, and were wary of concluding that the differences in sexual behavior between older and younger gay men represented a shift in sexual mores.|$|E

500|$|Few male {{respondents}} {{had engaged in}} childhood sex play, {{and it did not}} seem to be important in the development of homosexuality. Homosexual men were less likely to report having enjoyed boys' activities such as football and to see themselves as having been very masculine while growing up, but more likely to report having enjoyed stereotypical girls' activities. Three variables (dislike of typical boys' activities, enjoying typical girls' activities, and feelings of masculinity or femininity) were combined into a composite measure called [...] "Childhood Gender Nonconformity", which proved to be the most important developmental variable. It appeared to make male respondents less likely to feel attraction to the opposite sex during childhood, but more likely to feel sexually different from other boys, experience homosexual arousal and activities, and become homosexual as adults. Homosexual <b>men</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely to recall having felt different from other boys their age, or to say that they felt different because they did not like sport, or because they were not interested in girls or were sexually interested in other boys. They were also more likely to report feeling different because they had stereotypical feminine traits or interests. Feeling different during childhood appeared to be irrelevant, but feeling different for gender reasons during adolescence had [...] "modest total effects". Boys who felt sexually different were more likely to become homosexual as adults, whether they began to feel that way during childhood or adolescence. While homosexual <b>men</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely to have been labeled sexually different or homosexual before the age of 19, this apparently played no significant role in the development of sexual orientation.|$|E

Male respondents who were unusually close to their mothers {{were more likely to}} describe themselves as having been feminine children, but only a minority of boys with this kind of background became homosexual. Bell et al. concluded that male homosexuality is not the [...] "result of an unusually strong maternal identification", and that mothers have only a small influence on their sons′ psychosexual development. Homosexual men were less likely to give positive descriptions of their fathers, but more likely to have negative feelings toward their fathers, to dislike, hate, or fail to feel close to them, or to consider them hostile or detached. They {{were also more likely to}} feel more similar to their mothers than to their fathers, or to prefer to be like their mothers. Bell et al. concluded that, [...] "Unfavorable relationships with fathers" [...] have a weak connection to [...] "gender nonconformity and early homosexual experiences".|$|E
500|$|After the evacuation, the 7th Battalion was {{returned}} to Egypt, where Elliott rejoined it on 15 January. On 15 February, he was appointed to command, with the rank of brigadier general, the 1st Infantry Brigade, vice Brigadier General Nevill Smyth, who was being promoted. Two weeks later the news came that Smyth would not be promoted after all, so Elliott asked {{to be returned to}} the 7th Battalion. When the commander of the AIF, Lieutenant General Sir William Birdwood, offered Elliott the newly formed 14th Infantry Brigade in McCay's new 5th Division instead, Elliott said that he would prefer the 15th Infantry Brigade, as it was the Victorian brigade of the 5th Division, whereas the 14th was from New South Wales. Birdwood granted this request. Elliott soon made himself unpopular with Birdwood when he wanted to replaced three of the four battalion commanders allotted to him. [...] He was told that their reputations were sacred, but Elliott replied that the lives of his <b>men</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> so. Birdwood forced him to accept them for the time being; but Elliott eventually had his way. He also reorganised the brigade to match that of the Militia brigade of the same number at home.|$|E
500|$|Using data {{derived from}} {{interviews}} conducted in 1969 and 1970 with {{subjects in the}} San Francisco Bay Area, Bell et al. attempted to test explanations of sexual orientation put forward by psychoanalysts and social scientists. They found that while homosexual <b>men</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely than heterosexual men to have felt especially close to their mothers, this had almost {{no effect on the}} development of male homosexuality. Poor father-son relationships appeared to be weakly connected to male homosexuality. Homosexual women were more likely than heterosexual women to describe their relationships with their mothers as negative, and to have detached or hostile fathers, but only the latter factor seemed significant. In both sexes, but especially in men, homosexuality was connected to [...] "Childhood Gender Nonconformity", which was a measure partly of behavior more typical of the opposite sex and partly of subjective feelings of masculinity and femininity. Sexual abuse and labeling by others played no significant role. Bell et al. concluded that psychoanalytic explanations of sexual orientation are inadequate. They suggested that while bisexuality is subject to influence by social and sexual learning, the development of heterosexuality and homosexuality may have a biological basis, possibly influenced by hormonal factors. They hoped that demonstrating a biological basis to homosexuality would have beneficial effects such as increasing tolerance of gay people.|$|E
