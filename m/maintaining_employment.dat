Other stresses that transsexual people face in the workplace are being fearful of coworkers negatively responding to their transition, and losing job experience under a previous name—even deciding which rest room to use can prove challenging. Finding employment can be especially challenging for those in mid-transition.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the center}} of the NIRA was the National Recovery Administration (NRA), headed by former General Hugh S. Johnson, who had been a senior {{economic}} official in World War I. Johnson called on every business establishment in the nation to accept a stopgap [...] "blanket code": a minimum wage of between 20 and 45 cents per hour, a maximum workweek of 35–45 hours, and the abolition of child labor. Johnson and Roosevelt contended that the [...] "blanket code" [...] would raise consumer purchasing power and increase employment. To mobilize political support for the NRA, Johnson launched the [...] "NRA Blue Eagle" [...] publicity campaign to boost what he called [...] "industrial self-government". The NRA brought together leaders in each industry to design specific sets of codes for that industry; the most important provisions were anti-deflationary floors below which no company would lower prices or wages, and agreements on <b>maintaining</b> <b>employment</b> and production. In a remarkably short time, the NRA announced agreements from almost every major industry in the nation. By March 1934, industrial production was 45% higher than in March 1933.|$|E
