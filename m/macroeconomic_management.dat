25|$|Argentina enjoyed {{four years}} of rapid {{recovery}} from {{the economic and social}} crisis of 2001-02, {{which was one of the}} most severe losses of income and downturns in living standards on record. Effective <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>management,</b> focused on the generation of primary fiscal surpluses, has helped to sustain this strong performance. Consequently, average real GDP increased by nearly 9% per year between 2003 and 2006, surpassing the maximum GDP reached in 1998. Poverty and unemployment have fallen substantially from their peaks during the economic crisis. Poverty has declined to about 31% from a high of over 57% in 2002, while unemployment fell to near 11% from 21% in 2003.|$|E

We argue that <b>macroeconomic</b> risk <b>management</b> requires a broad approach encompassing financial, operational and strategic considerations. Furthermore, several interdependent sources of risk in the macroeconomic environment must be taken into account. Once this interdependence among, for example, exchange rates, interest rates and inflation are taken into account <b>macroeconomic</b> risk <b>management</b> can be considered a relatively self-contained aspect of Integrated Risk Management (IRM) provided relevant information is available to management.

We show that the popular parametric specification in the existing literature suffers from functional misspecification. The evidence suggests that the relationship is non-linear and hence the implied elasticities are non-constant, contrary to findings in the literature. The main finding of the study suggests that stock prices are significantly affected by macroeconomic fundamentals and oil price shocks albeit weakly. This reinforces the need to closely monitor behaviour of macroeconomic indicators while sustaining prudent <b>macroeconomic</b> policy <b>management...</b>|$|R

Employing panel data for 106 developing countries from 1970 to 2013, the results from our panel vector autoregressive (PVAR) model reveal that remittance volatility reduces macroeconomic risk in developing countries while simultaneously stimulating a reduction in domestic interest rates. This finding remains robust to alternative specifications of remittance volatility and monetary policy risk and to variations {{in the degree of}} financial development. The key lesson from this study is that developing countries can leverage the positive impact of remittances in reducing macroeconomic instability by implementing policies that induce remittances...|$|R

To confirm the results we measure the effects of redistribution of assets to assess gains and simulate general equilibrium effects using de Janviy and Sadoulet’s computable non-separable household economic model. We find that land redistribution remains a critical instrument in an asset driven approach to poverty alleviation, but that there might be conflicts between social efficiency and equity in redistributing assets because there are economies of scale in human capital assets and social capital for migration...|$|R
