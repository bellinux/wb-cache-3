50|$|In the 1931 Tour de France, {{there had}} been a time {{bonification}} system, which gave 3 minutes of bonification to the winner of the stage, if he finished more than three minutes ahead of the second cyclist in that stage. In 1932, this bonification system changed: now the winner of the stage received 4 minutes, the second-placed cyclist 2 minutes and the third-placed cyclist 1 <b>minute,</b> <b>plus</b> an extra three minutes if the margin was more than three minutes. The bonification system was invented to give sprinters, who lost {{a lot of time in}} the mountains, a chance to battle for the general classification.|$|R

25|$|The {{competition}} is a knock-out tournament. In each round of games {{the teams are}} paired at random, with the first team drawn listed as the home team. Every game lasts 90 <b>minutes</b> <b>plus</b> any additional stoppage time. The winner of each game advances to the next round, whilst the loser is eliminated from the tournament. If a game ends in a draw, the fixture is replayed at the home ground of the other team at a later date. If the replay also ends in a draw, 30 minutes of extra time is played followed by a penalty shoot-out if {{there is still no}} clear winner. In the semi-final and final rounds, if the game ends in a draw there is no replay; the winner is decided either in extra time or by a penalty shoot-out.|$|E
25|$|The {{length of}} a game of Australian Football can vary from league to league, but is {{generally}} around 15 to 25 minutes per quarter. In the AFL, each quarter runs for 20 <b>minutes</b> <b>plus</b> time on – which makes up for time occupied in stoppages, such as when the ball goes out of bounds, injuries, goals (or behinds) being kicked, or when the umpire is setting the angle of a free kick on goal. A typical AFL quarter might run from 27 to 33 minutes, but may be even longer if, for instance, injuries cause delays. AFL breaks after {{the first and third}} quarters are six minutes, with a 20-minute break at halftime. Thus, a match with quarters averaging 30 minutes would last {{about two and a half}} hours.|$|E
500|$|Susannah Schouweiler of Knight Arts wrote, [...] "at {{two hours}} and 45 <b>minutes,</b> <b>plus</b> a 20-minute intermission, [...] run time is an awfully long haul for the {{smallest}} circus-goers." [...] Critics have also commented on the occasional misstep in a performance; Rohan Preston noted in his review of Grimm that [...] "there are moments– just a few stand out– {{when you realize that}} these are students, after all, in a celebrated after-school program. You want them to succeed, even if they do not always." [...] Similarly, writing for BroadwayWorld, Elaina Lenertz stated, [...] "Sometimes their silks routines are a bit out of sync and sometimes the show features dance routines from younger kids who are still mastering stunts. Despite this, the performance is very impressive." ...|$|E
50|$|Since September 2012, the College {{introduced}} a new timetable of 7x 50 minute lessons, designed to give students more teaching time during the week.

5000|$|The Northern Ireland Assembly {{debated the}} issue in May 2012 where it was {{disclosed}} that 23 of Northern Ireland's 355 GP surgeries use an 0844 number. A briefing note was produced within, and for the usage of, UK government. This covered some of the history relating to the issue. Campaigners had already produced a simplified timeline. In their response to an ongoing Ofcom consulation on simplifying non-geographic numbers, NEG said [...] "Under the proposed new structure, Ofcom expects call cost descriptions to follow the format: 'This call will cost you X pence per <b>minute</b> <b>plus</b> your phone company's access charge.' We {{do not believe that}} it is appropriate for a patient to receive the Service Charge information advised by OFCOM when they contact their surgery as this will only seek to alarm them, and perpetuate the myth that all calls (to 084 numbers) are more costly." ...|$|R
500|$|RKO {{balked at}} the idea of distributing Fantasia, which it {{described}} as a [...] "longhair musical", and believed its duration of two hours and five <b>minutes</b> <b>plus</b> intermission was too long for a general release. It relaxed its exclusive distribution contract with Disney, who wanted a more prestigious exhibit {{in the form of a}} limited-run roadshow attraction. A total of thirteen roadshows were held across the United States; each involving two daily screenings with seat reservations booked in advance at higher prices and a fifteen-minute intermission. Disney hired film salesman Irving Ludwig to manage the first eleven engagements, who was given specific instructions regarding each aspect of the film's presentation, including the setup of outside theater marquees and curtain and lighting cues. Patrons were taken to their seats by staff hired and trained by Disney, and were given a program booklet illustrated by Gyo Fujikawa.|$|E
500|$|Champions League success {{struck a}} hard blow in the team, which saw its {{influential}} coach and key players leave to clubs from prominent European leagues. To replace Mourinho, Porto signed Luigi Delneri but the Italian was sacked before overseeing an official match, [...] and his place {{was taken by}} Víctor Fernández. His tenure did not start off well, as Porto lost the UEFA Super Cup {{for the second time}} in two years, going down 2–1 against Valencia. [...] Filling the Champions League title-holder spot in the group stage of the following season's tournament, Porto were drawn together with Chelsea, which meant Mourinho's return to the Estádio do Dragão. In the last group match, they hosted the Londoners in need of a win to assure qualification. As Damien Duff put Chelsea ahead, Porto were at risk of becoming the first holders not to get past the group stage, but goals from Diego and McCarthy saved Porto from premature elimination. [...] Nevertheless, the defending champions were subsequently knocked out in the round of 16, after losing 4–2 on aggregate against Inter. [...] Before this tie, Porto returned to Japan to contest the last edition of the Intercontinental Cup, 17 years after their first triumph. They dominated Colombia's Once Caldas for most of the 90 <b>minutes</b> <b>plus</b> extra-time, but were unable to score. It took 18 kicks from the penalty mark to decide the match 8–7 for Porto and give the club their second and last title in this competition.|$|E
500|$|Both the {{character}} and her role as narrator were generally well received by critics throughout the series, and for which Strong received nominations for multiple accolades. In his review of the pilot, Tom Shales of The Washington Post complimented Mary Alice character's narrations, writing: [...] "Even though narration {{has become the most}} overused technique in prime-time television (needed, perhaps, to help move the narrative along quickly now that hour-length shows have shrunk to as little as 41 <b>minutes</b> <b>plus</b> commercials), the producers of Desperate Housewives use it well, and Strong's uncomplaining perkiness adds yet another layer of irony to the enterprise." [...] Peter Schorn of IGN commended Strong's narrations as well as the mystery surrounding Mary Alice's suicide, calling {{the character}}'s [...] "dark secret" [...] the [...] "McGuffin that powers this first season". Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe described Mary Alice's suicide scene as [...] "mysterious and somber but mostly funny", pointing out that the soundtrack music remains [...] "light and happy" [...] throughout and likened the character's narration to that of Glenn Close in Reversal of Fortune (1990). Celia Wren, also writing for The Washington Post, confirmed that the [...] "idyllic small-town" [...] setting of Desperate Housewives as well as Mary Alice's narration style as a deceased and omniscient narrator were influenced by Edgar Lee Masters' Spoon River Anthology (1915), for which she complimented the series, writing: [...] "There's a lot of material to work with: Masters's poetic portrait gallery from 1915 gets its oomph from blowtorching the concept of idyllic small-town America. Its largely embittered personalities speak from beyond the grave of murders, seductions, suicides, hypocrisies, political corruption—enough scandalous behavior to make Desperate Housewives look like Little Women." ...|$|E
5|$|Based on {{his work}} for the 60 <b>Minutes</b> reports <b>plus</b> further {{investigation}} on his own, Thompson wrote A Glimpse of Hell. The book was published by W. W. Norton & Company.

50|$|Before {{satellite}} communication systems were widely available, {{the only way}} ships at sea had {{to communicate with the}} rest of the world was via radio connections to land stations. To talk to people who did not operate radio equipment, a vessel at sea would make contact with a land station, usually using high frequency AM or single-sideband (SSB) radio. The operator of the land station would patch the radio connection though to a telephone call made over the regular telephone system (referred to as a landline). The AT&T High Seas Service was a commercial radio-to-telephone connection system using the above land stations. The charges were typically settled by making the landline connection a collect call. Larger vessels maintained accounts with AT&T, but the service was available to any vessel with a marine HF radio. In the 1980s the radio link was priced at several dollars per <b>minute</b> <b>plus</b> the long distance landline charge from the High Seas station.|$|R
