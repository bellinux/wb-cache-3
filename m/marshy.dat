5|$|Growth {{was much}} slower in the east, and the modest {{extensions}} {{on this side}} were separated from the much larger extensions in the west by the <b>marshy</b> open area of Moorfields adjacent to the wall {{on the north side}} which discouraged development in that direction.|$|E
5|$|Battersea, {{listed as}} Patricesy (St Peter's Water) in the Domesday Book and first {{mentioned}} in records of 693 AD, {{on the south}} {{bank of the river}} opposite Chelsea, was by contrast low and <b>marshy</b> land, prone to flooding. Conditions were ideal for farming asparagus and lavender, and a small market town grew in the area based on the asparagus and lavender industries.|$|E
5|$|Blackdown and Sampford Commons have {{extensive}} surviving {{examples of the}} heathland, carr woodland and <b>marshy</b> grassland habitats that have developed on the acidic soils overlying the Greensand and Keuper Marls of the Blackdown Hills. The heathland supports a typical invertebrate fauna, including {{a wide variety of}} butterfly species, and with spiders notably abundant. The site is regionally important for birds which favour heathland habitats.|$|E
5|$|In this {{flat and}} <b>marshy</b> area, the {{branches}} and roots of mangrove trees form dams where deposits of oyster shells naturally accumulate along with mud and plant detritus. These tangles help retain soil, {{a process which}} expands the island where the power of tidal race would normally have the opposite effect.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the second}} battle between the French Army of the Danube, {{commanded}} by Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, and the Habsburg Army under Archduke Charles; the armies had met a few days earlier, 20–22March, on the <b>marshy</b> fields southeast of Ostrach and the Pfullendorf heights. The Austrian Army's superior strength, almost three-to-one, forced the French to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Most ferugliotheriids {{come from}} the Late Cretaceous epoch (Campanian–Maastrichtian ages, 84–66 million years ago, or mya) of Argentina, where they may have lived in a <b>marshy</b> or {{seashore}} environment. They coexisted with mammals such as dryolestoids {{and a variety of}} other animals, including dinosaurs. Ferugliotheriids may have been herbivores or omnivores.|$|E
5|$|The Poitevin breed {{was created}} in the marshes of the Poitou region, {{especially}} around Luçon, La Rochelle, Melle and Niort. It was developed through a mixture of human and natural selection to the <b>marshy</b> area that it inhabited. Although described as a draft horse, it was not selected for draft purposes, and was never popular for that use.|$|E
5|$|The Polden Hills a long, low ridge, {{extending}} for , {{and separated}} from the Mendip Hills, {{to which they are}} nearly parallel, by a <b>marshy</b> tract, known as the Somerset Levels. The ridge is underlain by Blue Lias with alternating strata of limestone, rheatic clay and Keuper marl.|$|E
5|$|To {{the north}} of Edinburgh lay the <b>marshy</b> Nor Loch, formed in the early 15th century in the {{depression}} where Princes Street Gardens are now laid out. This natural defence was augmented by the steep slope up to {{the northern edge of}} the Old Town. Edinburgh Castle, on its rocky outcrop, defended the western approach. Walls were therefore needed primarily on the south and east sides of the burgh.|$|E
5|$|A single Pe-3 was {{captured}} by the Finns when it {{had to make a}} forced landing in <b>marshy</b> ground near Lake Inari on 28 November 1942. It was relatively undamaged and was recovered, repaired and placed into service as 'PE-301'. It served with PLeLv 48 and was converted into a photo-reconnaissance aircraft in 1944 before being destroyed by a Soviet bombing raid on the airfield at Lappeenranta on 2 July 1944. By then, it had flown over 222 hours in Finnish service.|$|E
5|$|Although it can {{be found}} in {{elevations}} up to about , it is far more commonly found in humid lowland areas, and most often observed in subtropical, <b>marshy</b> regions of its range. It is also frequently found in shrublands, woodlands, agricultural fields, and mangroves, often adjacent to water, such as rivers, streams, rice paddies, and ditches. It may also sometimes be found in villages and suburban areas. It is able to survive in other habitats also.|$|E
5|$|An {{argument}} against herding is that juvenile remains are very uncommon at this site, unlike modern cases with herd mortality. They more likely were the periodic victims of flash floods whose carcasses accumulated {{in a lake}} or <b>marshy</b> setting. The Nehden find, however, with its greater span of individual ages, more even mix of Dollodon or Mantellisaurus to Iguanodon bernissartensis, and confined geographic nature, may record mortality of herding animals migrating through rivers.|$|E
5|$|Fleet Street was {{established}} as a thoroughfare in Roman London and {{there is evidence that}} a route led west from Ludgate by 200 AD. Local excavations revealed remains of a Roman amphitheatre near Ludgate on what was Fleet Prison, but other accounts suggest the area was too <b>marshy</b> for regular inhabitation by the Romans. The Saxons did not occupy the Roman city but established Lundenwic further west around what is now Aldwych and the Strand.|$|E
5|$|Fossils of Argentinean ferugliotheriids {{come from}} the Los Alamitos (Ferugliotherium), La Colonia (Ferugliotherium and Argentodites), and Allen Formations (Trapalcotherium). All three are {{approximately}} the same age, dating to the Campanian (84–71mya) or more likely the Maastrichtian (71–66mya), but the La Colonia Formation is perhaps a little younger. The Los Alamitos and Allen Formations may have been deposited in a <b>marshy</b> environments, and the depositional environment of the La Colonia Formations {{may have been an}} estuary, tidal flat, or coastal plain.|$|E
5|$|Further {{drainage}} of {{the mere}} occurred around 1720 and its land was reclaimed for farming. The ground remained <b>marshy</b> and still occasionally flooded {{at the start}} of the 20th century. In 1911 the castle was placed into the guardianship of the Commissioners of Works and Public Buildings, later passing into the control of the government heritage agency English Heritage. Archaeological surveys of the site were carried out in 1987, 1988, 1992 and 2001.|$|E
5|$|Harold's forces {{deployed}} in a small, dense formation {{at the top}} of steep slope, with their flanks protected by woods and <b>marshy</b> ground in front of them. The line may have extended far enough to be anchored on a nearby stream. The English formed a shield wall, with the front ranks holding their shields close together or even overlapping to provide protection from attack. Sources differ on the exact site that the English fought on: some sources state the site of the abbey, but some newer sources suggest it was Caldbec Hill.|$|E
5|$|NY173 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY31 in Ionia, a hamlet within {{the town of}} Van Buren. The route heads southeast, intersecting several county roads as it proceeds through a rural, <b>marshy</b> area of Onondaga County as Warners Road. It crosses over the New York State Thruway (Interstate90 or I-90) on {{its way into the}} hamlet of Warners, where it briefly follows Canton Street and crosses the CSX Transportation-owned Rochester Subdivision rail line before becoming Warners Road once again as it follows the railroad east out of the community and into the town of Camillus.|$|E
5|$|On September 16, 976, Rukn al-Dawla, {{the last}} of the first {{generation}} Buyids, died. After his death, Izz al-Dawla prepared to take revenge against Adud al-Dawla. He made an alliance with Fakhr al-Dawla, the brother of Adud al-Dawla and his father's successor to the territories around Hamadan. He also made an alliance with the Hamdanids prevailing in northern Iraq, the Hasanwayhid ruler Hasanwayh and the ruler of the <b>marshy</b> areas of southern Iraq. However, Mu'ayyad al-Dawla, the third son of Rukn al-Dawla, remained loyal to his eldest brother.|$|E
5|$|Renewed {{tension between}} Britain and France in the 1840s {{led to a}} {{modernisation}} of some of Britain's coastal defences. The batteries at Shornemead and Coalhouse Point were reinstated and upgraded, though the one at Lower Hope Point was never restored. In {{the case of the}} Coalhouse battery, it was substantially expanded between 1847 and 1855 to convert it into a fort. The work was slow as the <b>marshy</b> ground caused the foundations to crack and the structure to subside, and the contractor was unsatisfactory.|$|E
5|$|Smooth Meadow-grass and Broad-leaved Meadow-grass are {{widespread}} in damp lowland conditions, Wood Sedge (Carex sylvatica) in woodlands, and Oval Sedge and Early Hair-grass on upland moors. In damp conditions Phragmites reeds and {{several species of}} Juncus are found abundantly including Jointed Rush, Soft Rush and Toad Rush, and less commonly the introduced species Slender Rush. Common Cottongrass is a familiar site on <b>marshy</b> land, but Saltmarsh Sedge (Carex salina) was only discovered {{for the first time}} in 2004 at the head of Loch Duich.|$|E
5|$|Stretching {{between the}} Pfullendorf heights {{and the village}} lies a flat, wide plain, <b>marshy</b> in places, ringed with low-lying hills, and creased with a small {{tributary}} stream from which the village takes its name. Ostrach itself lies almost at {{the northern end of}} this plain, but slightly south of the Danube itself. By 7March, the first French forces arrived there, and the Austrians arrived a day or so later. Over the following week, additional forces for both sides arrived, and the two armies faced each other across this valley.|$|E
5|$|The 24th {{landed at}} Tanahmerah Bay on 22 April 1944 and seized the {{important}} Hollandia Airdrome despite torrential rain and <b>marshy</b> terrain. Shortly after the Hollandia landing, the division's 34th Infantry Regiment moved to Biak {{to reinforce the}} 41st Infantry Division. The regiment captured Sorido and Borokoe airdromes {{before returning to the}} division on Hollandia in July. The 41st and 24th divisions isolated 40,000 Japanese forces south of the landings. Despite resistance from the isolated Japanese forces in the area, the 24th Infantry Division advanced rapidly through the region. In two months, the 24th Division crossed the entirety of New Guinea.|$|E

In two months, Wai and his unit had crossed New Guinea and recaptured three airdromes from the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|The many-banded krait (Bungarus multicinctus), {{also known}} as the Taiwanese krait or the Chinese krait, is a highly venomous species of elapid snake found in much of central and {{southern}} China and Southeast Asia. The species was first described by the scientist Edward Blyth in 1861. This species has two known subspecies, the nominate Bungarus multicinctus multicinctus, and Bungarus multicinctus wanghaotingi. The many-banded krait mostly inhabits <b>marshy</b> areas throughout its geographical distribution, though it does occur in other habitat types.|$|E
5|$|The serval {{is similar}} to the {{sympatric}} caracal, but has a narrower spoor, a rounder skull, and lacks its prominent ear tufts. The African golden cat is darker, with different cranial features. It resembles the cheetah in its build and coat pattern, though not in size. The serval shares its adaptations to its <b>marshy</b> habitat with the jungle cat; both cats have large and sharp ears that help in locating the prey efficiently, and their long legs raise them above muddy ground and water.|$|E
5|$|This river {{crossing}} takes the two roads into Bass River Township, Burlington County, where US 9 merges off the Garden State Parkway. The route heads northwest onto two-lane undivided New York Road through woods, intersecting the northern terminus {{of the northern}} segment of Route 167. At this point, the route turns north and comes to a junction with CR 542. US 9 turns east into residential New Gretna before crossing under the Garden State Parkway without an interchange and passing over the <b>marshy</b> Bass River. This section runs along {{the eastern edge of}} the heavily forested Pine Barrens, with occasional areas of development.|$|E
5|$|After this interchange, US 9 crosses CR 646 {{and enters}} Absecon. The route crosses the <b>marshy</b> Absecon Creek prior to passing businesses. After {{crossing}} under New Jersey Transit’s Atlantic City Line, another route into Atlantic City, US 30 (White Horse Pike), crosses US 9. After US 30, the road turns east into wooded neighborhoods, becoming Wyoming Avenue. Route 157 intersects US 9 from the south, with US 9 making {{a left turn}} to head northeast onto Shore Road. The road continues into Galloway Township, with residential development becoming less dense as it runs a short distance {{to the west of}} inland bays, intersecting the southern terminus of CR 561.|$|E
5|$|As more {{virgin forest}} {{was lost to}} tavy, {{communities}} increasingly planted and cultivated permanent plots of land. By 600CE, groups of these early settlers had moved inland and begun clearing the forests of the central highlands. Rice was originally dry planted or cultivated in <b>marshy</b> lowland areas, which produced low yields. Irrigated rice paddies were adopted in the highlands around 1600, first in Betsileo country in the southern highlands, then later in the northern highlands of Imerina. By the time terraced paddies emerged in central Madagascar over the next century, the area's original forest cover had largely vanished. In its place were scattered villages ringed with nearby rice paddies and crop fields a day's walk away, surrounded by vast plains of sterile grasses.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 18th century, the French {{government}} {{tried to}} impose a system of crossing Poitevin horses with lighter-weight Norman and Thoroughbred horses to create cavalry horses. Despite financial incentives, private breeders protested because they felt that the resulting crossbred horses created poor quality mules upon further breeding. The changes also affected the characteristics of the breed that had been developed for work in its <b>marshy</b> homeland, including large hooves and a calm manner. Some sources argue that at this point the breed was employed for agricultural and logging uses. Others state that they were not pulling horses, and were instead used almost solely for the production of mules.|$|E
5|$|By 24 May, the Germans had {{captured}} {{the port of}} Boulogne and surrounded Calais. The engineers of the 2nd Panzer Division under Generalmajor Rudolf Veiel built five bridges over the Canal Line and only one British battalion barred the way to Dunkirk. On 23 May, Rundstedt had ordered the panzer units to halt, concerned about the vulnerability of his flanks {{and the question of}} supply to his forward troops. He was also concerned that the <b>marshy</b> ground around Dunkirk would prove unsuitable for tanks and he wished to conserve them for later operations (in some units, tank losses were 30–50 percent). Hitler was also apprehensive, and on a visit to Army Group A headquarters on 24 May, he endorsed the order.|$|E
5|$|DE 9 {{crosses the}} <b>marshy</b> Little River {{and enters the}} town of Little Creek, where it becomes Main Street and is lined with residences. The route comes to an {{intersection}} with the eastern terminus of DE 8 as it leaves Little Creek and becomes Bayside Drive again. The road continues northwest through farmland with some trees and homes, passing to the southwest of Octagonal Schoolhouse before heading through the community of Cowgills Corner. Past this intersection, the route runs southwest of Chandelle Estates Airport. DE 9 curves {{to the north and}} enters the town of Leipsic. At this point, the route turns northwest onto Denny Street and runs past homes and businesses, curving north to intersect the eastern terminus of DE 42.|$|E
5|$|De Gomme {{prepared}} several {{plans for}} the King in 1665; a further iteration of the designs was submitted in 1670 and given royal approval. Work began the same year but it took until 1685 to complete the project. The work {{was carried out by}} skilled contractors, who were supplemented by large teams of pressed men brought in from across the region; during 1671, up to 256 workers were employed on the site. Around 3,000 timber piles had to be brought from Norway for the project in 1671 to support the foundations in the <b>marshy</b> ground. The resources needed for the King's multiple defence projects became stretched, and one of the planned bastions at Tilbury, originally planned to face the river, was cancelled in 1681, in part to save money. The total cost of the project is unknown, but was significantly more than the original estimate of £47,000.|$|E
5|$|During Roman times, {{the land}} {{surrounding}} the rivers Ouse and Foss was <b>marshy,</b> making the site easy to defend. The city {{is prone to}} flooding from the River Ouse, and has an extensive (and until 2015 mostly effective) network of flood defences with walls along the river, and a liftable barrier across the River Foss where it joins the Ouse at the 'Blue Bridge'. In October and November 2000 York experienced the worst flooding in 375 years with more than 300 homes flooded. In December 2015 the flooding was more extensive and caused major disruption. The extreme impact led to a personal visit by Prime Minister David Cameron. Much land {{in and around the}} city is on flood plains too flood-prone for development other than agriculture. The ings are flood meadows along the Ouse, while the strays are open common grassland in various locations around the city.|$|E
5|$|During this period, the Ottoman army, {{based in}} Ruse, was {{preparing}} to cross the Danube and undertake a major attack. Michael was quickly forced to retreat and the Ottoman forces started to cross the Danube on 4 August 1595. As his army was outnumbered, Michael avoided carrying the battle in open field, and decided to give battle on a <b>marshy</b> field located {{near the village of}} Călugăreni on the Neajlov river. The Battle of Călugăreni started on 13 August and Michael defeated the Ottoman army led by Sinan Pasha. Despite the victory, he retreated to his winter camp in Stoieneşti because he had too few troops to mount a full-scale war against the remaining Ottoman forces. He subsequently joined forces with Sigismund Báthory's 40,000-man army (led by István Bocskay) and counterattacked the Ottomans, freeing the towns of Târgovişte (8 October), Bucharest (12 October) and Brăila, temporarily removing Wallachia from Ottoman suzerainty.|$|E
5|$|Following the Battle of the Komandorski Islands, Admiral Kinkaid {{requested}} a larger force of 25,000 troops {{to support an}} assault on Kiska. However, as there were not enough ships to transport such a large division to the Aleutians, Kinkaid suggested that the Americans' objective change from Kiska, which was defended by about 9,000 men, to Attu, which was home to only 500 Japanese. On April 1, Kinkaid received approval from the Joint Chiefs of Staff to execute the operation, codenamed SANDCRAB. The terrain of Attu Island was not hospitable for such an operation – much of the island's landmass not covered in snowy peaks was covered in muskeg, a <b>marshy</b> soil type that {{is almost impossible to}} cross by foot. In addition, Attu Island was subject to frequent storms and soupy fogs.|$|E
5|$|Here, DE 9 turns {{northeast}} onto East 6th Street, {{crossing a}} <b>marshy</b> creek and widening into a four-lane divided highway. The route curves north and becomes Wilmington Road, passing through commercial areas. The road crosses the Norfolk Southern New Castle Secondary again {{and runs through}} suburban residential neighborhoods and businesses, leaving New Castle. DE 9 becomes New Castle Avenue and passes {{to the west of}} Veterans Memorial Park before it comes to an interchange with I-295/US 40 a short distance {{to the west of the}} Delaware Memorial Bridge. After the Rogers Road intersection, DE 9 becomes a four-lane undivided road that continues through industrial and residential areas, crossing under I-495. The road briefly becoming a divided highway again and intersects the southern terminus of DE 9A, which heads east to provide access to I-495 and the Port of Wilmington.|$|E
