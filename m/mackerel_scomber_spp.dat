40|$|Research PaperIn {{this paper}} we analyse {{different}} econometric procedures of technical efficiency to estimate fishing capacity. These procedures are then {{applied to the}} purse seine fishery located in the Gulf of Cádiz. The target species of this fishery has changed quite a lot {{over the past few}} years. It used to be <b>mackerel</b> (<b>Scomber</b> <b>spp.).</b> Afterwards, it was anchovy (Engraulis encrasicholus) and, recently, sardine (Sardina pilchardus). The regulation of anchovy and sardine fisheries by European Union is only based on Total Allowable Catch for vessels which are longer than 10 metres. This management measure could be unsuitable in this fishery for two reasons. Firstly, most of the vessels measure less than 10 metres and, secondly, there is a small interrelation between vessel efficiency and length...|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} has not deeply explored—through an activity-based approach—the economic viability of fisheries at the fishing unit level by simultaneously modelling the monthly {{dynamic of the}} different landings of fishing units and the ex-vessel market prices. This research aims to partially fill this gap by developing an activity-based stochastic decision support system for the main small pelagic species—European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), European sardine (Sardina pilchardus) and <b>mackerel</b> (<b>Scomber</b> <b>spp.).</b> This model is able to simulate the income effects from different fishery policies and the individual fisherman’s strategies. The overall results {{show that there is}} high variability in the economic impacts from the fisheries management tools, which primarily depend on: i) the adopted fishing method, ii) the monthly landings dynamics, iii) the relevant fixed costs and iv) the low ex-vessel market prices and their instability due to the weak bargaining power of the fishermen and the buyers’ and final consumers’ limited willingness to pay for small pelagic species. From a policy point of view, the uncertain profit for the fishing unit’s owner and the unstable crew wages suggest that any proposed management tool at this micro level should be carefully evaluated to complement the area-scale and the enterprise level evaluation...|$|E
30|$|To avoid starvation, {{the fish}} must be {{conditioned}} {{to feed on}} the supplied diet, usually a combination of dead <b>mackerels</b> (<b>Scomber</b> <b>spp.),</b> sardines (Clupeidae family), shrimp and squid, cut to size as needed. The addition of live food {{has been found to}} induce predation activity and to encourage feeding behaviour in some Scombrid species (Wexler et al. 2003). Overcoming handling stress and instigating feeding during the first few days in the tank seem to be the most crucial factor for the fish adaptation to captivity, and once overcome, the survival rate increases significantly.|$|R

The fish are usually small, between about , {{although}} some caught are up to [...] The aquatic prey is mostly caught by diving into {{the water from the}} air, although flying fish, the preferred fish of this species, are sometimes caught while in the air.

5000|$|Bryde's whales feed on a {{wide variety}} of fish, planktonic crustaceans, and cephalopods. In the western North Pacific, Bryde's whales caught by Japanese {{scientific}} whaling vessels (2000-2007) mainly fed on Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicus, 52%) and various species of euphausiid (36%, including Euphausia similis, E. gibboides, Thysanoessa gregaria, and Nematoscelis difficilis), as well as oceanic lightfish (Vinciguerria nimbaria, nearly 3%), and <b>mackerels</b> (<b>Scomber</b> <b>spp.,</b> less than 2%). The prey differed by location and season. In coastal areas, euphausiids dominated the diet, comprising 89 and 75% of the diet in May and June, respectively. Further offshore, Japanese anchovy was the dominant species, accounting for nearly 100% of the diet in late summer. Based on the stomach contents of Bryde's whales caught by Japanese pelagic whaling expeditions in the North Pacific in the 1970s, the majority where found to feed on euphausiids (nearly 89%), whereas only about 11% fed on fish.Off South Africa, prey preferences differed between the inshore and offshore forms. The former mainly feed on anchovies (Engraulis capensis, 83%), maasbankers (Trachurus trachurus, 36%), and pilchards (Sardinops ocellata, 33%), with only one (or 3%) being found with euphausiids (Nyctiphanes capensis). The latter, however, mainly feed on euphausiids (primarily Euphausia lucens, but also E. recurva, N. capensis, and Thysanoessa gregaria), as well as various deep-sea fish (including Mueller's pearlside, Maurolicus muelleri, and a species of Lestidium). One was even found [...] "full of baby squid" [...] (later identified as Lycoteuthis diadema).|$|R
40|$|Background. Stocks of many {{marine fishes}} are in decline {{and a number}} of studies suggest that for some species the impact of {{recreational}} angling may be important. To date, only recreational (leisure) fishing surveys have been conducted in Portugal, with no studies on beach angling competitions, dynamically increasing in number over the past 10 to 20 years. In view of the above, we decided to evaluate the impact of such events on the Algarve coast (southern Portugal) in terms of the abundance, diversity, and respective weight of fish species caught and outline some conservation measures and recommendations for the management of the targeted species. Materials and methods. Participants of 22 angling competitions taking place between February and June 2007 were surveyed. In each competition a random sample of anglers was interviewed, and the specimens caught by each participant were identified, weighed, and measured. Results. Thirteen taxa belonging to eight families were identified, and the most common were: garfish, Belone belone (Linnaeus, 1761); mullets, Mugilidae (not identified); and <b>mackerels,</b> <b>Scomber</b> <b>spp.</b> A total of 563 specimens were sampled, totalling 75. 4 kg of weight, with the average catch per angler weighing 0. 5 +/- 0. 05 SE (n = 153) kg. Differences were also observed between the length at first maturity (L(50)) of the specimens caught and their respective Minimum Landing Size (MLS) and Allowed Minimum Size (AMS), most particularly {{in the case of the}} European seabass, Dicentrarchus labrax (L.), with almost all individuals caught measuring below the species-specific L 50. Analysis of time series of competition results (1996 - 2009) showed no evidence of a decrease in catches or in mean weight. Conclusion. Based on the results we propose that the AMS for beach angling competitions should be increased to the MLS in order to prevent the capture of juvenile fishes, especially the sea bass. Future studies should address the size selectivity of the hooks used in beach competitions, with a view to the implementation of a minimum hook size for competitions...|$|R

Sensory evaluation showed that better storage life was observed for bogue, sardine and striped mullet by using the European Community (EC) freshness grading scheme of raw fish and for bogue and Mediterranean hake by using sensory panel evaluation of cooked fish fillets.

40|$|Restriction-site {{associated}} DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) {{and related}} methods are revolutionizing {{the field of}} population genomics in non-model organisms as they allow generating an unprecedented number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) even when no genomic information is available.

Using the Atlantic <b>mackerel</b> (<b>Scomber</b> scombrus L.) and a close relative, the Atlantic chub <b>mackerel</b> (<b>Scomber</b> colias), as case study, here we explore the sensitivity of population structure inferences to two crucial aspects in RAD-seq data analysis: {{the maximum number of}} mismatches allowed to merge reads into a locus and the relatedness of the individuals used for genotype calling and SNP selection.
