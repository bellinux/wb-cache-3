50|$|At 7:30pm on 1 June 1960, New Zealand's first {{television}} channel, AKTV2, started broadcasting in Auckland from the NZBC building at 74 Shortland Street, previously used to broadcast {{public radio station}} 1YA and now home to The University of Auckland's Gus Fisher Gallery. Owned and operated by the New Zealand Broadcasting Service (NZBS, which became the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation in 1962), it initially broadcast for two hours a day, two days a week. Christchurch's CHTV3 followed in June 1961, Wellington's WNTV1 a month later, and Dunedin's DNTV2 on 31 July 1962. The numbers referred to the VHF Band I channel allocation that the main transmission (ie. not repeaters) was broadcast on: channel 1 (44-51 MHz) in Wellington (<b>Mount</b> Kaukau), <b>channel</b> 2 (54-61 MHz) in Auckland (Waiatarua) and Dunedin (<b>Mount</b> Cargill), and <b>channel</b> 3 (61-68 MHz) in Christchurch (Sugarloaf).

The plasma for MHD generator is produced using a shock tube. In order to obtain a clear and sharp image of the supersonic plasma flow in MHD generator channel, the color schlieren method has been employed. The experimental results show clearly shock waves and Prantle-Meyer fans in MHD channel. In the case of the flush <b>mounted</b> electrode <b>channel,</b> the adjusting wave is formed at the end of channel and moves to upstream. The pressure increases smoothly and the flow Mach number decreases from supersonic to subsonic through the adjusting wave.

A submerged rock had ripped through six water-tight compartments of the hull, from the bows to the engine room. Stokers were killed instantly as water rushed onto the boilers causing them to explode. Lower-deck portholes burst under the water pressure and the sea flooded in swamping passengers asleep in their bunks.

Reporting for the first time for vertically <b>mounted</b> open top <b>channels,</b> in this work the theory for capillary rise in channels of rectangular cross-section has been tested and verified, taking into account the effects of surface topography assuming a Wenzel state. The theory has been tested via capillary rise experiments using polydimethylsiloxane oils of viscosity 96. 0, 48. 0, 19. 2 and 4. 8 mPa s within the 400 μm and 600 μm closed square glass tubes and SU 8 open top smooth walled rectangular cross-section channels having width 400 μm and 600 μm and depth 135 μm. It has been shown that capillary rise heights in plane open top walled channels (with roughness factor of 1) can be fitted using the exact numerical solution and that these are similar to fits using the analytical visco-gravitational solution. The viscous friction contribution was found to be higher than predicted by theory assuming a non-rigidified liquid–air boundary, but far below that for a rigidified boundary, which is recently reported for imbibition into horizontally <b>mounted</b> open micro <b>channels.</b> It has also been observed that fingers of liquid spreading along the internal edges of the smooth walled channels in advance of the main body of liquid consistent with wetting expectations.

40|$|Tidal inlets {{are a very}} dynamic coastal form. Sediment {{transport}} {{patterns and}} net sediment transport directions are of great importance with respect to tidal inlet stability. In this research, bedload and suspended load sediment transport and the factors governing this transport are investigated in the inlet channel of the small Slufter tidal inlet {{on the island of}} Texel, in the northwestern Netherlands. A triangular frame was place in the inlet channel, to which three Acoustic Doppler Velocimeters (ADV) for measuring flow velocity, three Optical Backscatter Sensors (OBS) for measuring suspended sediment concentrations and a wave gauge for measuring water levels and water depths were <b>mounted.</b> <b>Channel</b> migration was monitored using a DGPS. Migration of the channel only takes place where the channel crosses the sand flat and is very dependent on flow velocities. Bedforms showed a highly three dimensional pattern with lengths in the order of meters and heights in the order of decimetres. No migration of bedforms took place for flow velocities below 0. 6 m/s. Inflow takes place in two pulses, while outflow occurs in one single pulse. The higher the tidal amplitude and the setup, the higher the flow velocities in the channel. The system as a whole is ebb dominated. Only during storm, water flows in over the large sand flats {{on each side of the}} channel, but flows out via the channel. No waves enter the inlet, except for infragravity waves under storm conditions. Quantifying bedload sediment transport with dune tracking techniques was not possible. The OBS and ADV measurements of suspended sediment concentration could only be used to deduce a general pattern in transport rates, but could not be quantified. The suspended sediment concentration is a result of local flow velocities. The concentration profiles from the ADV and OBS showed very good mixing of suspended sediment and show that in the Slufter a sand/mud mixture is in suspension. For bedload as well as suspended load, calculations showed almost no transport under calm weather conditions, an export of several cubic meters per fifty hours for more energetic weather conditions and an export of several tens of cubic meters under storm conditions. For the total transport, bedload as well as suspended load are important contributors. The amount and magnitude of storms is very important to the total net export through the Slufter inlet channel on the long term. For the Slufter system as a whole, import of sediment takes place during storm over the beach flat and mud is captured in the backbasin. These processes reduce the export of sediment for the system as a whole and thereby bring the system closer to equilibrium...|$|R

40|$|Shown in Figure 1 is a {{side view}} of the D 0 F-disk assembly. SVX II chips are mounted to a flex copper/kapton Circuit, which is glued to a {{beryllium}} substrate. Figure 1 shows {{the top and bottom}} disk assemblies mounted on the cooling channel. However the disks are not mounted directly opposite one another as shown, but alternately rotate through 30 {sup o} wedges mounted {{on either side of the}} cooling channel. The assumed channel temperature for these calculations is 0 C, as in the cases of the ladder cooling calculations, ref. [1] and [2]. The assumed SVX II chip power is 0. 400 W. The finite difference method is used to calculate the temperature profiles of the various components. It is described in Ref. [1]. Each disk is read out using SVX II chips on both sides of the silicon. The silicon is 59. 2 mm wide at its widest location. The SVX II chip location opposite the cooling channel has 8 chips mounted on the hybrid. and there are 6 SVX II chips mounted outboard of the cooling channel on the same side as the cooling channel. The SVX II chips mounted on the same side as the cooling channel read out the silicon via a jumper which passes between the beryllium substrate and the cooling channel. Currently there are two substrate materials under consideration for the jumper; kapton/copper and silicon/aluminum. The two materials have different thermal properties. so both will be considered in this note in order to compare their performance in the two different assemblies. The silicon jumper is assumed to be 0. 3 mm thick with a thermal conductivity of 0. 15 W/mm-K. The kapton/copper flex circuit is assumed to be 0. 075 mm in thickness, with 1 / 2 oz copper traces (a thickness of 0. 017 mm copper with 0. 4 W/m-K thermal conductivity) along the length. The thermal conductivity of kapton is 0. 12 E- 3 W/mm-K [3]. The F-Disk region is occupied by cables which extend from the barrel ladders. The cables dissipate power [4] and will contribute to warming the gas. The SVX IT chips on both the disks and the ladders will also contribute to warming the gas. In addition, this region will not be perfectly insulated from the surrounding gas, which is considerably warmer than the cooling channel. The exposed cooling channels (bulkhead and disk <b>mount</b> <b>channels).</b> on the other hand, will contribute to cooling the gas in this region. The gas temperature in which the disks reside is not known due to all these uncertainties. The range of gas temperatures considered for this thermal analysis is 10 - 15 C [5].
