5|$|Lobatus gigas is a prey {{species for}} several {{carnivorous}} gastropod mollusks, including the apple <b>murex</b> Phyllonotus pomum, the horse conch Pleuroploca gigantea, the lamp shell Turbinella angulata, the moon snails Natica spp. and Polinices spp., the muricid snail <b>Murex</b> margaritensis, the trumpet triton Charonia variegata and the tulip snail Fasciolaria tulipa. Crustaceans are also conch predators, {{such as the}} blue crab Callinectes sapidus, the box crab Calappa gallus, the giant hermit crab Petrochirus diogenes, the spiny lobster Panulirus argus and others. Sea stars, vertebrates, including fish (such as the permit Trachinotus falcatus and the porcupine fish Diodon hystrix), loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) and humans also dine on the queen conch.|$|E

On August 24, 1892, <b>Murex</b> became the first tanker {{to pass through the}} Suez Canal. By the time Shell merged with Royal Dutch Petroleum in 1907, the company had 34 steam-driven oil tankers, compared to Standard Oil's four case-oil steamers and 16 sailing tankers.|$|E
5|$|Zoology is {{discussed}} in Books VIII to XI. The encyclopedia mentions different sources of purple dye, particularly the <b>murex</b> snail, the highly prized source of Tyrian purple. It describes the elephant and hippopotamus in detail, {{as well as the}} value and origin of the pearl and the invention of fish farming and oyster farming. The keeping of aquariums was a popular pastime of the rich, and Pliny provides anecdotes of the problems of owners becoming too closely attached to their fish.|$|E

25|$|The Roman mythographer Julius Pollux, {{writing in}} the 2nd century AD, {{asserted}} (Onomasticon I, 45–49) that the purple dye was first discovered by Heracles, or rather, by his dog, whose mouth was stained purple from chewing on snails {{along the coast of}} the Levant. Recently, the archaeological discovery of substantial numbers of <b>Murex</b> shells on Crete suggests that the Minoans may have pioneered the extraction of Imperial purple centuries before the Tyrians. Dating from collocated pottery suggests the dye may have been produced during the Middle Minoan period in the 20th–18th century BC. Accumulations of crushed <b>murex</b> shells from a hut at the site of Coppa Nevigata in southern Italy may indicate production of purple dye there from at least the 18th century BC.|$|E
25|$|The Israelites used an indigo-colored dye called tekhelet; this dye {{was likely}} made from snail <b>murex</b> trunculus. This dye was very {{important}} in both Jewish and non-Jewish cultures of this time, and was used by royalty and the upper-class in dyeing their clothing, sheets, curtains, etc. This dye is known as Tyrian purple.|$|E
25|$|Natural sources {{also include}} mollusks, the <b>Murex</b> sea snails produce {{a mixture of}} indigo and dibromoindigo (red) which {{together}} produce a range of purple hues known as Tyrian purple. Light exposure during part of the dying process can convert the dibromoindigo into indigo resulting in blue hues known as royal blue or hyacinth purple.|$|E
25|$|Economic {{development}} in the colony of Malaka included industries {{for the production of}} sea salt and possibly of purple dye. The Phoenicians had discovered in the waters off the coast <b>murex</b> sea snails, the source of the famed Tyrian purple. The city had its own mint (sikka in the Phoenician language) and minted coinage. The Phoenician colonial period lasted approximately from 770 to 550 BC.|$|E
25|$|<b>Murex</b> purple {{was a very}} {{important}} industry in many Phoenician colonies and Carthage was no exception. Traces of this once very lucrative industry are still visible in many Punic sites such as Kerkouane, Zouchis, Meninx and even in Carthage itself. According to Pliny, Meninx (today's Djerba) produced the best purple in Africa which was also ranked second only after Tyre's. It was found also at Essaouira (Morocco).|$|E
25|$|Dor was {{the most}} {{southern}} settlement of the Phoenicians {{on the coast of}} Syria and a center for the manufacture of Tyrian purple, extracted from the <b>murex</b> snail found there in abundance. Dor is first mentioned in the Egyptian Story of Wenamun, as a port ruled by the Tjeker prince Beder, where Wenamun (a priest of Amun at Karnak) stopped on his way to Byblos and was robbed.|$|E
25|$|Other {{products}} of Africa Province were shipped out. An ancient industry at Carthage involved cooking up a Mediterranean condiment called garum, a fish sauce made with herbs, {{an item of}} durable popularity. Rugs and wool clothing were fabricated, and leather goods. The royal purple dye, <b>murex,</b> first discovered and made famous by the Phoenicians, was locally produced. Marble and wood, as well as live mules, were also important export items.|$|E
25|$|Carthage's economy {{began as}} an {{extension}} of that of its parent city, Tyre. Its massive merchant fleet traversed the trade routes mapped out by Tyre, and Carthage inherited from Tyre the trade in the extremely valuable dye Tyrian purple. No evidence of purple dye manufacture has been found at Carthage, but mounds of shells of the <b>murex</b> marine snails from which it derived have been found in excavations of the Punic town which archaeologists call Kerkouane, at Dar Essafi on Cap Bon. Similar mounds of <b>murex</b> have also been found at Djerba on the Gulf of Gabes in Tunisia. Strabo mentions the purple dye-works of Djerba {{as well as those of}} the ancient city of Zouchis. The purple dye became one of the most highly valued commodities in the ancient Mediterranean, being worth fifteen to twenty times its weight in gold. In Roman society, where adult males wore the toga as a national garment, the use of the toga praetexta, decorated with a stripe of Tyrian purple about two to three inches in width along its border, was reserved for magistrates and high priests. Broad purple stripes (latus clavus) were reserved for the togas of the senatorial class, while the equestrian class had the right to wear narrow stripes (angustus clavus).|$|E
25|$|Armed {{with the}} canal {{companies}} specifications, Samuel had James Fortescue Flannery designing tankers for Bnito — the Russian oil {{company of the}} Rothschilds — and ordered three tankers from William Gray & Company in northern England. Named the <b>Murex,</b> the Conch and the Clam, each had a capacity of 5,010long tons of deadweight. In 1893 the Samuel brothers founded the Tank Syndicate together with Fred Lane and Asian trading companies. In 1897 it was renamed Shell Transport and Trading company, forerunner of today's Royal Dutch Shell company.|$|E
25|$|A 9th-century wreck {{known as}} Tantura B, most likely an Arab trading vessel, was {{discovered}} in shallow water off the Tantura coast. Excavations were conducted from 1994 to 1996 by the Institute for Nautical Archaeology (Texas A University) and the University of Haifa's Center for Maritime Studies {{under the direction of}} Shelley Waschsmann and Yaakov Kahanov. The Tantura B hull was found resting on top of another shipwreck dating to the Roman period. Excavations at Tel Dor in 1986 unearthed an intact purple dye manufacturing installation, based on dye extracted from <b>murex</b> marine snails.|$|E
25|$|The reputed {{founders of}} ancient Gythium were Heracles and Apollo, who {{frequently}} appear on its coins {{or in other}} legends, and Castor and Pollux: the former of these names may point {{to the influence of}} Phoenician traders from Tyre, who, we know, visited the Laconian shores at a very early period. It is thought that Gytheio may have been the center of their purple dye trade because the Laconian Gulf had a plentiful source of <b>murex.</b> In classical times it was a community of Perioeci, politically dependent on Sparta, though doubtless with a municipal life of its own.|$|E
25|$|The dye {{substance}} is a mucous secretion from the hypobranchial gland {{of one of}} several species of medium-sized predatory sea snails that {{are found in the}} eastern Mediterranean Sea. These are the marine gastropods Bolinus brandaris the spiny dyemurex, (originally known as <b>Murex</b> brandaris Linnaeus, 1758), the banded dye-murex Hexaplex trunculus, the rock-shell Stramonita haemastoma, and less commonly a number of other species such as Bolinus cornutus. The dye is an organic compound of bromine (i.e., an organobromine compound), a class of compounds often found in algae and in some other sea life, but much more rarely found in the biology of land animals.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{families}} of attractive shells (such as cones, cowries, marginellas, and <b>murex)</b> are particularly favoured by collectors. World record size shells (commonly {{indicated by the}} acronym 'WRS') of species in the most popular families are much sought after by some shell collectors, and can thus command high prices. Collections of such shells are exhibited {{at a number of}} specialist museums, including the Bailey-Matthews Shell Museum. Maximum and minimum sizes are also of interest to malacologists, and may be useful in delimiting closely related species. As an extensive compilation of maximum shell sizes, the registry has found use as a data source for scientific studies.|$|E
25|$|For much of {{its history}} Rainham was an {{agricultural}} settlement, using the River Thames for trade. In the 16th century industry was limited to a boat-builder and tannery. There are links between Rainham farms and the City of London from the Middle Ages and after the wharf was redeveloped in the 1720s trade increased; including the bringing of muck from London {{for use in the}} fields. By 1929 most of the farmland had been given over to market gardening. The ferry to London was supplemented with new coaching links in the 18th century and a railway station opened in 1854. A second wharf was constructed in 1872 and from 1869 there was a growth in industrial development, including chemical and fertiliser factories. The <b>Murex</b> iron-founders moved to Rainham in 1917 and grew along the river, eventually becoming part of the British Oxygen Company. Away from the river, other industries included brickmaking and after World War II there was a growth in gravel extraction.|$|E
25|$|Several other {{invertebrates}} {{have been}} domesticated, both terrestrial and aquatic, including {{some such as}} Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies and the freshwater cnidarian Hydra for research into genetics and physiology. Few {{have a long history}} of domestication. Most are used for food or other products such as shellac and cochineal. The phyla involved are Cnidaria, Platyhelminthes (for biological control), Annelida, Mollusca, Arthropoda (marine crustaceans as well as insects and spiders), and Echinodermata. While many marine molluscs are used for food, only a few have been domesticated, including squid, cuttlefish and octopus, all used in research on behaviour and neurology. Terrestrial snails in the genera Helix and <b>Murex</b> are raised for food. Several parasitic or parasitoidal insects including the fly Eucelatoria, the beetle Chrysolina, and the wasp Aphytis are raised for biological control. Conscious or unconscious artificial selection has many effects on species under domestication; variability can readily be lost by inbreeding, selection against undesired traits, or genetic drift, while in Drosophila, variability in eclosion time (when adults emerge) has increased.|$|E
25|$|The Paleolithic {{showcase}} {{displays the}} journey of man through the stone age, covering important {{events such as the}} discovery of fire, hunting and cave paintings. The Neolithic showcase covers the dawn of agriculture, animal domestication, the beginnings of pottery, villages and religion. The terracotta figurines collection shows their evolution from the Bronze Age to the Roman era, and their importance in the development of religion. The metal figurines collection includes mostly males and gods, used as symbols of power. The Bronze Age displays show artefacts dated between 3000 BC and 1200 BC including evidence of early writing, trade and urbanization. The Iron Age displays shows evidence of the invasions of seafaring raiders and city states during the period between 1200 BC and 400 BC. The Phoenician showcases display the extraction of purple dye from <b>murex</b> shells, pottery and Phoenician glass. Phoenician religion is represented by a large stelae of a priest, a throne of Astarte, libation spoons and a glass amulet. Another notable feature of this section is the Ford Mandible dating from the 5th century BC showing the earliest known example of dentistry. The Bodashtar inscription is also displayed along with an explanation of the development of the linear alphabet. The Classical period collection includes funerary reliefs from Palmyra, Egypt and the Levant, a Byzantine mosaic and collection of funerary sarcophagi displayed on the staircase leading to the mezzanine. The Islamic period displays materials from the Umayyad Period in 656 AD to the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century where glazed tiles and plates are shown. The newly-added mezzanine includes table cases displaying small objects such as a collection of coins, scarabs and seals, lamps, amulets, cosmetics, jewelry, tools and weapons.|$|E
500|$|The premier luxury dye of {{the ancient}} world was Tyrian purple or royal purple, a purple-red dye which is {{extracted}} from several genera of sea snails, primarily the spiny dye-murex <b>Murex</b> brandaris (currently known as Bolinus brandaris). [...] <b>Murex</b> dye was greatly prized in antiquity because it did not fade, but instead became brighter and more intense with weathering and sunlight. [...] <b>Murex</b> dyeing may have been developed first by the Minoans of East Crete or the West Semites along the Levantine coast, and heaps of crushed <b>murex</b> shells have been discovered at a number of locations along the eastern Mediterranean dated to the mid-2nd millennium BC. The classical dye known as Phoenician Red was also derived from <b>murex</b> snails.|$|E
500|$|Other {{luxury and}} high-status {{products}} {{were made from}} molluscs. Tyrian purple, made from the ink glands of <b>murex</b> shells, [...] "...fetched its weight in silver" [...] {{in the fourth century}} BC, according to Theopompus. The discovery of large numbers of <b>Murex</b> shells on Crete suggests the Minoans may have pioneered the extraction of [...] "imperial purple" [...] during the Middle Minoan period in the 20th–18th centuries BC, centuries before the Tyrians. Sea silk is a fine, rare, and valuable fabric produced from the long silky threads (byssus) secreted by several bivalve molluscs, particularly Pinna nobilis, to attach themselves to the sea bed. Procopius, writing on the Persian wars circa 550 CE, [...] "stated that the five hereditary satraps (governors) of Armenia who received their insignia from the Roman Emperor were given chlamys (or cloaks) made from lana pinna. Apparently, only the ruling classes were allowed to wear these chlamys." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>Murex</b> dyes were fabulously expensive– one snail yields but {{a single}} drop of dye– and the Roman Empire imposed a strict {{monopoly}} on their use from the reign of Alexander Severus (AD 225–235) that was maintained by the succeeding Byzantine Empire until the Early Middle Ages. The dye was used for imperial manuscripts on purple parchment, often with text in silver or gold, and porphyrogenitos or [...] "born in the purple" [...] was a term for Byzantine offspring of a reigning Emperor. [...] The color matched the increasingly rare purple rock porphyry, also associated with the imperial family.|$|E
500|$|The {{document}} is a [...] scroll consisting of {{three pieces of}} parchment glued together and rolled, and {{is believed to have}} been created in the Fulda monastery. A scientific study of the purple parchment took place in Munich in 1966, which showed that minium (red lead) and madder were used for staining the document, indicating that it was created in the Holy Roman Empire, rather than in the Byzantine Empire, where the <b>Murex</b> shell for making Tyrian purple was tightly controlled. This {{document is}} one of the oldest surviving examples of madder being used in the Middle Ages. The purple background was made from Byzantine silk woven with fourteen circular medallions and two half medallions. The medallions contain representations of animals fighting, inspired by Near Eastern art.|$|E
500|$|Other bivalves, such as mussels, attach {{themselves}} to hard surfaces using tough byssus threads made of keratin and proteins. They are more exposed to attack by predators than the burrowing bivalves. Certain carnivorous gastropod snails such as whelks (Buccinidae) and <b>murex</b> snails (Muricidae) feed on bivalves by boring into their shells, although many Busyconine whelks (e.g., Busycon sinistrum, Busycon carica) are [...] "chipping-style" [...] predators. The dog whelk (Nucella lamellosa) drills a hole with its radula assisted by a shell-dissolving secretion. The dog whelk then inserts its extendible proboscis and sucks out the body {{contents of the}} victim, which is typically a blue mussel. The whelk needs {{a few hours to}} penetrate the shell and thus living in the littoral zone is an advantage to the bivalve because the gastropod can attempt to bore through the shell only when the tide is in.|$|E

2500|$|The {{production}} of <b>Murex</b> purple for the Byzantine court {{came to an}} abrupt end with the sack of Constantinople in 1204, the critical episode of the Fourth Crusade. David Jacoby concludes that [...] "no Byzantine emperor nor any Latin ruler in former Byzantine territories could muster the financial resources required for the pursuit of <b>murex</b> purple production. On the other hand, <b>murex</b> fishing and dyeing with genuine purple are attested for Egypt in the tenth to 13th centuries." [...] By contrast, Jacoby finds that there are no mentions of purple fishing or dyeing, nor trade in the colorant in any Western source, even in the Frankish Levant. The European West turned instead to vermilion provided by the insect Kermes vermilio, known as grana, or crimson.|$|E

2500|$|Now, {{while there}} is no {{prohibition}} on wearing blue dye from another source, the rabbis maintain that other kinds of Tekhelet do not fulfill the Mitzvah of Tekhelet, and thus all the strings have been traditionally kept un-dyed (i.e., white) for many centuries.
