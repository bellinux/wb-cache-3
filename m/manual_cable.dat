50|$|An {{aero engine}} inertia starter uses a pre-rotated {{flywheel}} to transfer kinetic {{energy to the}} crankshaft, normally through reduction gears and a clutch to prevent over-torque conditions. Three variations have been used, hand driven, electrically driven and a combination of both. When the flywheel is fully energised either a <b>manual</b> <b>cable</b> is pulled or a solenoid is used to engage the starter.|$|E
5000|$|A passenger-only ferry system {{known as}} [...] "Planchones", {{consists}} of roofed wooden rafts. It traverses the Sinu river along {{a system of}} <b>manual</b> <b>cable</b> tows. It was made {{as a way to}} cross the river before a proper bridge could be built and has served as an alternative to cross the river ever since. It {{is one of the most}} remarkable features of the city.|$|E
50|$|The Fujifilm FinePix S3 Pro is an {{interchangeable}} lens digital single-lens reflex camera introduced in February 2004. Its successor, the Finepix S5 Pro, {{was released on}} 25 September 2006. It {{is based on a}} Nikon F80 (N80 in the U.S.) viewfinder, shutter, mirror-box and autofocus modules surrounded by a Fujifilm body that includes its own proprietary CCD image sensor and electronics, and a vertical grip shutter release. It has a Nikon F lens mount and can use most lenses made for 35 mm Nikon SLR cameras, but only with manual operation with Nikon AIS lenses, unusually for a digital SLR the S3 Pro can be used with a <b>manual</b> <b>cable</b> release.|$|E
50|$|A {{redesign}} of the <b>manual</b> transmission's <b>cable</b> actuator solved the shift-quality issue, while a new Aisin Warner automatic transmission replaced the somewhat unreliable Renault unit which {{was well known}} to dump its transmission fluid on the road generally without prior warning. The series I automatics are probably therefore best avoided second hand.|$|R
50|$|Included are key {{telephone}} systems and most private branch exchanges. Excluded from CPE are overvoltage protection equipment and pay telephones. Other types of {{materials that are}} necessary for the delivery of the telecommunication service, but are not defined as equipment, such as <b>manuals</b> and <b>cable</b> packages, and cable adapters are instead referred to as CPE-peripherals.|$|R
50|$|The Data Recorder set {{includes}} an instruction <b>manual,</b> a data <b>cable,</b> a Nintendo-branded Compact cassette, a 6 volt AC adapter, and a carry handle that {{extends from the}} front bezel.|$|R

"National Automotive Service; Division, Starting, Lighting, Ignition; National Automotive Service; National Service <b>Manuals,</b> <b>Cable</b> Address 'Autoserv'; Automotive Maintenance Data, Hearst Building - San Francisco, Sept. 22, 1931; Coast Envelope & Leather Products Co., Traction Ave & Ross St., Los Angeles, Calif.; Attn: Mr. R. Luss, Gentlemen: Today we {{received}} {{one of the}} new binders which you are making for your National Service Manual. We are highly pleased with it. The workmanship and appearance is far superior to any previous cover that we have purchased from other binderies. The cover we had previously used now looks like a 'poor relation' alongside of this beautiful new cover. You are certainly deserving of the highest praise for the splendid quality of your products. Judging from our experience, we are convinced that it would be to the best interests of all other Concerns, who require binders, to spoure them from you. Yours very truly, National Automotive Service, G. A. Seiler" [...] on letter...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to realize a new {{prosthetic}} socket, which wants to {{lay the foundation for}} a new generation of sockets. A first assessment of the residual limb volume fluctuations and pressure distribution is given, since there is clearly a lack of this information in literature, especially regarding transfemoral amputees. Indeed, two transfemoral amputees have been considered for this thesis. According to these parameters the design was realized. The temperature issue has been minimized by designing a prototype, made of struts and opened areas, which should let the skin breath. Secondly, the structure accommodates volume variations and enhances the comfort through the application of the layer jamming principle. Indeed, the layer jamming allows to control the stiffness through vacuum pressure. Hence The layer jamming allows to increase the structure stiffness during specific tasks, while, during the rest of the time, it makes it softer and it enhances the comfort. A <b>manual</b> <b>cabling</b> system has been used to modulate the compression acted by the struts. The socket realization workflow was speed up by 3 D printing the components on the base of the shapes of the amputeesâ€™ residual limb...|$|R
5000|$|The {{vehicle is}} {{available}} with both manual and automatic transmissions. The manual gearboxes {{are made by}} ZFhttp://www.zf.com of Ecomid range and automatic transmissions by Allisonhttp://www.allisontransmission.com/There are two <b>manual</b> gearboxes with <b>cable</b> linkage system and servo assist to reduce gear changing effort. The 6 speed overdrive has a direct shift pattern and is available with [...] and [...] engines.The 9 speed overdrive range change with so called double H pattern is available for tractor units and higher GCM vehicles.|$|R
25|$|The board {{insisted that}} Thomson join the 1858 cable-laying expedition, without any {{financial}} compensation, and {{take an active}} part in the project. In return, Thomson secured a trial for his mirror galvanometer, about which the board had been unenthusiastic, alongside Whitehouse's equipment. However, Thomson found the access he was given unsatisfactory and the Agamemnon had to return home following the disastrous storm of June 1858. Back in London, the board was on the point of abandoning the project and mitigating their losses by selling the cable. Thomson, Cyrus West Field and Curtis M. Lampson argued for another attempt and prevailed, Thomson insisting that the technical problems were tractable. Though employed in an advisory capacity, Thomson had, during the voyages, developed a real engineer's instincts and skill at practical problem-solving under pressure, often taking the lead in dealing with emergencies and being unafraid to lend a hand in <b>manual</b> work. A <b>cable</b> was finally completed on 5 August.|$|R
