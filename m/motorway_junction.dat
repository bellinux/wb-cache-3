5|$|Clevedon {{has some}} light industry, mainly in {{industrial}} estates including Hither Green Trading Estate near the M5 <b>motorway</b> <b>junction,</b> {{and it is}} also a dormitory town for Bristol. The Clerical Medical pensions and investments group, part of HBOS, had its headquarters in the town on the former site of the Hales Cakes factory, but after its closure, North Somerset Council entered into talks to take over the lease. Percy Daniel & Co is a firm of organ builders, whose work includes the instrument in Brentwood Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|The seafront has {{ornamental}} gardens, a Victorian bandstand {{and other}} attractions. Salthouse Field has a light railway running round the perimeter {{and is used}} for donkey rides in the summer. The shore consists of pebbled beaches and low rocky cliffs, with the old harbour at {{the western edge of}} the town at the mouth of the Land Yeo. The rocky beach has been designated as the Clevedon Shore geological Site of Special Scientific Interest. Clevedon Pier, opened in 1869, is one of the earliest surviving examples of a Victorian pier. On 17 October 1970, two outward spans collapsed when the seventh set of legs from the shore failed during a routine insurance load test. A trust was eventually formed and the pier and its buildings were restored and reopened on 27 May 1989, when the Waverley paddle steamer berthed and took on passengers. Other landmarks include Walton Castle, Clevedon Court the Clock Tower and the Curzon Cinema. Clevedon's light industry is centred mainly in industrial estates including Hither Green Trading Estate near the M5 <b>motorway</b> <b>junction.</b> It is a dormitory town for Bristol. The town is home to educational, religious and cultural buildings and sports clubs.|$|E

50|$|The M4 {{motorway}} {{opened in}} 1971, providing Swindon with two <b>motorway</b> <b>junctions</b> (numbers 15 and 16).

The development of the town included the erection of the Wyvern Theatre.|$|R
25|$|The Auckland Southern Motorway {{was built}} between 1953 and 1978, {{bypassing}} the former route via Great South Road. The {{construction of the}} Central <b>Motorway</b> <b>Junction</b> between 1973 and 1978 connected the Northern and Southern Motorways, taking State Highway 1 off inner Auckland streets.|$|E
25|$|From 2006 information, {{the busiest}} stretch of SH 1 was {{just south of}} the Auckland Central <b>Motorway</b> <b>Junction,</b> on/near the Newmarket Viaduct, with over 200,000 {{vehicles}} (either way) each day. The least busy parts of the network (excluding off-ramps and on-ramps) are on SH 43 north-east of Whangamomona, with fewer than 120 vehicles (counting both directions) in a day.|$|E
25|$|When the M4 was {{diverted}} {{over the}} Second Severn Crossing, it was anticipated that these services may close. However, although the original buildingwhich had offered {{views of the}} River Severnwas sold, due to business falling {{as a consequence of}} traffic using the newer bridge, operations continued in a new, much smaller development on an adjacent site nearer the <b>motorway</b> <b>junction.</b>|$|E
50|$|Newport's Travel to Work Area {{incorporates}} much {{of south}} Monmouthshire; the new 2001-based area also includes Cwmbran.

50|$|The A43 {{starts at}} M40 {{junction}} 10 (the location of Cherwell Valley Services) which {{is widely regarded}} as being one of the worst <b>motorway</b> <b>junctions</b> in the country despite improvements made in the early 2000s.

50|$|Altham {{is on the}} A678 road; {{the nearest}} <b>motorway</b> <b>{{junctions}}</b> are M65 junctions 7 (west of Clayton-le-Moors) and 8 (near Huncoat).As of September 2016, the village is served by only one bus route; the 152 operated by Blackburn Bus Company, which connects the village to Burnley, Blackburn and Preston.|$|R
25|$|The Auckland Harbour Bridge, {{opened in}} 1959, {{is the main}} {{connection}} between the North Shore {{and the rest of}} the Auckland metropolitan area. The bridge provides eight lanes of vehicle traffic and has a moveable median barrier for lane flexibility, but does not provide access for rail, pedestrians or cyclists. The Central <b>Motorway</b> <b>Junction,</b> also called 'Spaghetti Junction' for its complexity, is the intersection between the two major motorways of Auckland (State Highway 1 and State Highway 16).|$|E
25|$|Several {{solutions}} {{have been}} proposed in the past, including building another bridge alongside the existing one, a tunnel, or combinations of both. Following a detailed scoping study undertaken in 1996, Transit New Zealand identified its preferred options for a new crossing - either a new bridge approximately 500 m west of the bridge connecting to the North-Western Motorway (SH16) via a tunnel underneath Ponsonby and Grey Lynn, or a tunnel slightly {{to the east of}} the bridge connecting to the Central <b>Motorway</b> <b>Junction</b> via twin cut-and-cover tunnels under the western CBD / Victoria Park.|$|E
25|$|Earlier {{feasibility}} studies saw the possible terminus {{of a new}} Waitematā Harbour Crossing (possibly as a tunnel) at Wynyard Point. These have now been shelved by Transit New Zealand, with one remaining option being a longer tunnel to surface near Fanshawe Street or further south along Cook Street, possibly with an underground public transport station somewhere underneath the Tank Farm. A less likely option has also been proposed by Mike Lee, Auckland Regional Council chairman, who suggested a tunnel underneath the Auckland CBD to emerge east of the city centre at Stanley Street, thus avoiding the Central <b>Motorway</b> <b>Junction</b> and city centre traffic.|$|E
50|$|Aspley Guise is centred 6 mi SE of Milton Keynes and 1 mi {{south of}} the M1 <b>motorway's</b> <b>junction</b> 13, which is the country's {{principal}} motorway from London to County Durham, West Yorkshire and South Yorkshire and south of its junction with the M6 motorway to other northern cities.|$|R
