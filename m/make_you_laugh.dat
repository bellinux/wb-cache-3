[...] According to the Bums Corner's review the film was a [...] "treat for all ages, and that it was a colorful, musical, humorous romp." [...] Keith Allen of Movie Rapture gave the film 2.5 stars out of 3, explaining that the film's humor was surprisingly clever, and that the film would frequently <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>laugh.</b> Mutant Reviewers commented that although the Muppet deal with Walt Disney was [...] "disappointing", the film managed to be funny and witty.|$|E

5000|$|Roger Ebert {{awarded the}} film {{four out of}} four stars and wrote in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, [...] "The movie is a satire that {{contains}} just enough realistic ballast to be teasingly plausible; like Dr. Strangelove, it <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> <b>laugh,</b> and then it <b>makes</b> <b>you</b> wonder." ...|$|R
500|$|In {{the course}} of his review of [...] "La Couchette", Stevens {{suggested}} that Inside No. 9 is something of an acquired taste.

500|$|Humor {{plays an}} {{important}} role in No One Lives Forever. As Hubbard explained, the game's intention is [...] "to <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>laugh,</b> but not at the expense of providing a broader, more satisfying emotional experience than a spoof generally allows, so that even if you don't chuckle once, you can still have plenty of fun playing the game. At heart, NOLF is an action/adventure/espionage game with a healthy dose of levity." [...] Humor is presented mainly via visual gags, overheard conversations, textual intelligence items, and cutscenes. The humor includes [...] "situational humor, and even a dash of absurdity and bathroom humor for good measure. Some of it is subtle, some of it isn't." [...] The name of UNITY, H.A.R.M., and other fictional organizations mentioned in the game follow the spy genre formula of using contrived acronyms for organizations (see List of fictional espionage organizations). What H.A.R.M. actually stands for is never revealed, and speculation about its true meaning is used as a running gag in the game and its sequel.|$|E

Well, no. We had really good fun doing this song, so the video should <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>laugh.</b> I mean, it should be sick, too." [...] Magnus Carlsson, Swedish creator of the {{animated}} series Robin, was commissioned by the band to make the video. Radiohead were fans of the show, and connected with the Robin character; Jonny Greenwood described him as [...] "affectionate" [...] and [...] "vulnerable", while Yorke admitted that he found Robin [...] "quite the vulnerable character, but he's also violently cynical and quite tough and would always get up again." [...] At first Carlsson sought to work on a video for [...] "No Surprises" [...] and was uncertain as to how to approach [...] "Paranoid Android". Eventually he devised a scenario to the band's liking after he locked himself in his office for over 12 hours to stare out of the window, while listening to the song on repeat while jotting down visual ideas. As Carlsson did not have access to the lyrics at the time, the concept for the video was based entirely on the song's sound. According to Yorke, the band [...] "deliberately didn't send Magnus the lyrics" [...] because they [...] "didn't want [...] to be too literal." ...|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the album was positive overall. Robin Denselow of The Guardian awarded the album four of five stars and wrote that Wainwright's performance sounded as [...] "easy-going and spontaneous" [...] and it does at his live concerts. Denselow considered [...] "House" [...] to be the album's best track. The Daily Telegraph Colin Irwin described the album as [...] "oddly uplifting" [...] despite its [...] "variants on the theme that we're all doomed" [...] from the economic crisis. The Observer contributor Neil Spencer wrote that [...] "while [...] tone becomes shrill at times, his mix of nihilism and jauntiness (with ukulele) are finally uplifting." [...] Music journalist Andy Gill of The Independent recommended the tracks [...] "House", [...] "Fear Itself [...] " [...] and [...] "The Panic Is On". Simmy Richman's review for The Independent complimented Wainwright's ability to address current issues [...] "simply and effectively", claiming [...] "Wainwright can <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>laugh,</b> nod in agreement, shake your fist in despair and want to sing along". Richman appreciated Wainwright's honesty and humor and wrote that he displayed [...] "better lyrical form than {{he has been in}} for some time". The Independent included 10 Songs on their [...] "Indy Choice: Best of the New Music" [...] list for the week of July 16, 2010. PopMatters' Alex Ramon preferred Wainwright's album Social Studies (1999), but considered 10 Songs to be [...] "an enjoyable effort nonetheless", complimenting it for its simple approach. Furthermore, Ramon wrote that the album [...] "succeeds in getting you smiling rather than despairing at the mess we're in, and that's always been one of Wainwright's great gifts".|$|E
500|$|Although officially retired, Grimaldi still {{received}} half of {{his former}} small salary from Drury Lane until 1824. [...] Soon after the fee stopped, Grimaldi fell into poverty {{after a number of}} ill-conceived business ventures and because he had entrusted management of his provincial earnings to people who cheated him. Despite his disabilities, he offered his services as a cameo performer in Christmas pantomimes. [...] Along with Bologna, he re-appeared briefly at Sadler's Wells where he gave some acting instruction to the mime artist William Payne, the future father of the Payne Brothers. [...] He also started working for Richard Brinsley Peake, namesake of Richard Brinsley Sheridan, who was the dramaturge at the English Opera House. Peake hired Grimaldi to star in Monkey Island alongside his son JS. However, Grimaldi's health deteriorated further and he was forced to quit before the show opened; his scene was cut. [...] The early end to his career, worries about money, and the uncertainty over his son's future made him increasingly depressed. To make light of it, he would often joke about his condition: [...] "I <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>laugh</b> at night but am Grim-all-day". In 1828, two [...] "farewell" [...] benefit performances were held for him. [...] In the first, he appeared as Hock the German soldier and a drunken sailor in Thomas Dibdin's melodrama The Sixes; or, The Fiends at Sadler's Wells to an audience of 2,000 people. Unable to stand for long periods of time, he sang a duet with JS and finished the evening with a scene from Mother Goose. His last farewell benefit performance on 27 June 1828 was at Drury Lane. Between 1828 and 1836, Grimaldi relied on charity benefits to replace his lost income.|$|E
500|$|As {{the series}} progressed, reviews became more positive, and Friends {{became one of}} the most popular sitcoms of its time. It is now often ranked among the all-time best TV shows. Critics commended the series as having {{consistently}} sharp writing and chemistry between the main actors. Noel Holston of Newsday, who had dismissed the pilot as a [...] "so-so Seinfeld wannabe" [...] in 1994, repudiated his earlier review after rewatching the episode, and felt like writing an apology to the writers. Heather Havrilesky of Salon.com thought that the series [...] "hit its stride" [...] in the second season. Havrilesky found the character-specific jokes and situations [...] "could reliably <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>laugh</b> out loud a few times each episode", and the quality of writing allowed the stories to be [...] "original and innovative." [...] Bill Carter of The New York Times called the eighth season a [...] "truly stunning comeback." [...] Carter found that by [...] "generating new hot storylines and high-decibel laughs", the series made its way [...] "back into the hearts of its fans." [...] However, Liane Bonin of Entertainment Weekly felt that the direction of the ninth season was a [...] "disappointing buzzkill", criticizing it for the non-stop celebrity guest spots and going into jump the shark territory. Although disappointed with the season, Bonin noted that [...] "the writing [...] still sharp." [...] Havrilesky thought that the tenth season was [...] "alarmingly awful, far worse than you would ever imagine a show that was once so good could be." [...] Friends was featured on Times list of [...] "The 100 Best TV Shows of All-Time", saying, [...] "the well-hidden secret of this show was that it called itself Friends, and was really about family." ...|$|E

[...] Green took over Lytton's nine patter roles until Lytton's return about two months later.

He also began substituting more frequently for Lytton in the role of Jack Point. [...] In 1934, Lytton's retirement left Green as the principal comedian of the D'Oyly Carte company, playing all of the comic roles in their repertory over the next five years. Green gained enthusiastic notices for, among other things, his excellent diction and comedic stage movement, despite the World War I injury to his left knee. Green finally added John Wellington Wells in The Sorcerer to his long list of roles when the company revived that work in 1938, and he appeared in the film version of The Mikado in the role of Ko-Ko in 1939.
