5|$|Larger scale state-generating {{processes}} {{developed in}} Slavic {{areas in the}} 9th century. Great <b>Moravia,</b> the most prominent Slavic state of the era, became established in the early 9th century south of modern Poland. The original lands of Great <b>Moravia</b> included what is now <b>Moravia</b> and western Slovakia, plus parts of Bohemia, Pannonia and southern regions of Lesser Poland. The glory of the Great Moravian empire became fully apparent in light of archeological discoveries; lavishly equipped burials are especially spectacular. Such finds do not extend to the lands that now constitute southern Poland, however. The great territorial expansion of Great <b>Moravia</b> {{took place during the}} reign of Svatopluk I {{at the end of the}} 9th century. The Moravian state collapsed quite suddenly; in 906, weakened by an internal crisis and Magyar invasions, it ceased to exist entirely.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} set of posted routes in New York were {{assigned}} in 1924, the segment of modern NY38A between its southern terminus in <b>Moravia</b> and NY359 in Skaneateles was designated as part of NY26, a northsouth highway extending from Ithaca to Syracuse. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY26 was split into several routes. From Dryden to <b>Moravia,</b> NY26 became part of NY38. Between <b>Moravia</b> and modern NY359, it became the southern half of the new NY38A, an alternate route of NY38 around the east side of Owasco Lake that continued from the current NY359 junction to Auburn by way of a previously unnumbered roadway.|$|E
5|$|Béla and Daniil Romanovich united {{their troops}} and invaded Austria and <b>Moravia</b> in June 1252. After their withdrawal, Ottokar, Margrave of Moraviawho had married Margaret of Austriainvaded and {{occupied}} Austria and Styria. In {{the summer of}} 1253, Béla launched a campaign against <b>Moravia</b> and laid siege to Olomouc. Daniil Romanovich, Boleslaw the Chaste of Cracow, and Wladislaw of Opole intervened on Béla's behalf, but he lifted the siege {{by the end of}} June. Pope Innocent IV mediated a peace treaty, which was signed in Pressburg (Bratislava, Slovakia) on 1 May 1254. In accordance with the treaty, Ottokar, who had in the meantime become King of Bohemia, ceded Styria to Béla.|$|E
50|$|<b>Moravia's</b> Racconti Romani {{has been}} adapted into film three times. The first, in 1954, {{in the film}} Too Bad She's Bad {{directed}} by Alessandro Blasetti with Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni, adapting the story, Fanatico. <b>Moravia's</b> stories were used again in 1955 under director Gianni Franciolini starring Totò, Vittorio De Sica, and Giovanna Ralli, entitled Racconti Romani. A third film, La giornata balorda, filmed in 1960 and directed by Mauro Bolognini, also borrowed from <b>Moravia's</b> stories.|$|R

5|$|In the 1920s, {{the portion}} of NY38 between Owego and Freeville was {{designated}} as New York State Route42 while the segment from Freeville to <b>Moravia</b> was {{the southern part of}} New York State Route26, a highway that continued north from <b>Moravia</b> to Syracuse. NY38 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, utilizing all of pre-1930 NY42, the Freeville–Moravia portion of NY26, and a previously unnumbered highway north to Sterling. Originally, NY38 extended south into the village of Owego by way of an overlap with NY96. It was truncated to its current southern terminus by 1994.|$|E
5|$|Louis {{was only}} nine when he stamped a treaty of {{alliance}} between his father and John of Bohemia. A year later, Louis accompanied his father in invading Austria. On 1 March 1338, John of Bohemia's son and heir, Charles, Margrave of <b>Moravia,</b> signed a new treaty with Charles I of Hungary and Louis in Visegrád. According to the treaty, Charles of <b>Moravia</b> acknowledged the right of Charles I's sons to succeed their maternal uncle, Casimir III of Poland, if Casimir died without a male issue. Louis also pledged that he would marry the margrave's three-year-old daughter, Margaret.|$|E
5|$|On April13, 1825, the {{legislature}} chartered the Auburn and Port Byron Turnpike Company. The Auburn and Port Byron Turnpike {{began at the}} Auburn State Prison in Auburn and proceeded northward along the routing of NY38 to meet the north branch of the Seneca Turnpike {{in the town of}} Brutus (now Throop). From there, the turnpike continued on NY38 through Port Byron to the Seneca River, where it ended at a bridge crossing the river at Mosquito Point. In 1851, the Auburn and <b>Moravia</b> Plank Road Company was incorporated. They were tasked with connecting <b>Moravia</b> to Auburn by way of a plank road along the western side of Owasco Lake (now NY38).|$|E

5|$|The Slavs {{arrived from}} the East between the 5th and 6th centuries during the Migration Period. As a {{response}} to onslaughts by Avars, the local Slavic tribes rebelled and established Samo's Empire (623–658), the first known Slavic political entity. In the 9th century, the castles at Bratislava (Brezalauspurc) and Devín (Dowina) were important centres of the Slavic states: the Principality of Nitra and Great <b>Moravia.</b> Scholars have debated the identification as fortresses of the two castles built in Great <b>Moravia,</b> based on linguistic arguments {{and because of the}} absence of convincing archaeological evidence.|$|E
5|$|The route heads {{northwest}} {{from the}} county line, following the Owasco Inlet through open fields and past small patches of trees to the large hamlet of Locke. NY38 heads north–south through the residential community as Main Street and intersects NY90 {{at the center of}} the hamlet. North of the community, the highway crosses over the Owasco Inlet and enters another rural area dominated by fields situated amongst forests. Upon crossing into the town of <b>Moravia,</b> the amount of development along the highway increases as it passes Fillmore Glen State Park and approaches the village of <b>Moravia.</b>|$|E

5|$|Before the {{adoption}} of Christianity in territory, which is today Poland, {{there were a number}} of different a pagan tribes.

5|$|Bishop Bricius's {{chapter of}} eight clerics {{consisted}} of the dean, precentor, treasurer, chancellor, archdeacon and three ordinary canons. His successor, Bishop Andreas de <b>Moravia,</b> greatly expanded the chapter to cater for the much-enlarged establishment by creating two additional hierarchical posts (succentor and subdean) and added 16 more prebendaries. In total, 23 prebendaries had been created {{by the time of}} Andreas' death, and a further two were added just before the Scottish Reformation. Prebendary churches were at the bestowal of the bishop as the churches either were within the diocesan lands or had been granted to the bishop by a landowner as patronage. In the case of Elgin Cathedral, the de <b>Moravia</b> family, of which Bishop Andreas was a member, is noted as having the patronage of many churches given as prebends.|$|E

5|$|Louis {{joined a}} crusade against the pagan Lithuanians in December 1344. The crusadersincluding John of Bohemia, Charles of <b>Moravia,</b> Peter of Bourbon, and William of Hainaut and Holland laid siege to Vilnius. However, a Lithuanian {{invasion}} of the lands of the Teutonic Knights forced them to lift the siege. Louis returned to Hungary in late February 1345. He dispatched Andrew Lackfi to invade the lands of the Golden Horde {{in retaliation for the}} Tatars' earlier plundering raids against Transylvania and the Szepesség (now Spiš in Slovakia). Lackfi and his army of mainly Székely warriors inflicted a defeat on a large Tatar army. Thereafter the Golden Horde's control of the lands between the Eastern Carpathians and the Black Sea weakened. A conflict between Louis's uncle and father-in-law (Casimir III of Poland and Charles of <b>Moravia)</b> led to a war between Poland and Bohemia in April. In this war Louis supported his uncle with reinforcements in accordance with the agreement of 1339.|$|E
