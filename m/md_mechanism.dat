40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationship between cognitive mechanisms, applied by people to rationalize and justify harmful acts, and engagement in traditional peer and cyber aggression among school children. We examined the contribution of moral disengagement (MD), hostile attribution bias, and outcome expectancies, and we further explored the individual contribution of each <b>MD</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Our aim was to identify shared and unique cognitive factors of the two forms of aggression. Three hundred and thirty-nine secondary school children completed self-report measures that assessed MD, hostile attribution bias, outcome expectancies, and their roles and involvement in traditional and cyber aggression. We found that the MD total score positively related to both forms of peer-directed aggression. Furthermore, traditional peer aggression positively related to children's moral justification, euphemistic language, displacement of responsibility and outcome expectancies, and negatively associated with hostile attribution bias. Moral justification also related positively to cyber aggression. Cyber aggression and cyber victimization were associated {{with high levels of}} traditional peer aggression and victimization, respectively. The results suggest that MD is a common feature of both traditional and cyber peer aggression, but it seems that traditional forms of aggression demand a higher level of rationalization or justification. Moreover, the data suggest that the expectation of positive outcomes from harmful behavior facilitates engagement in traditional peer aggression. The differential contribution of specific cognitive mechanisms indicates the need for future research to elaborate on the current findings, in order to advance theory and inform existing and future school interventions tackling aggression and bullying...|$|E

The approach used is pseudo-static, where the seismic effects are considered by {{taking into account}} static inertia forces. The upper-bound method of limit analysis is used. Two failure mechanisms, {{referred to as the}} M 1 and <b>M</b> 2 <b>mechanisms,</b> are considered for the calculation schemes.

M 2 consists of an arc sandwich composed of a triangular active wedge, a circular radial shear zone and a triangular passive wedge. The solutions obtained are rigorous upper-bound ones in the framework of the limit analysis theory for an associated flow rule Coulomb material. For the static case, the numerical results of the {{bearing capacity}} factors show that the <b>M</b> 1 <b>mechanism</b> gives the exact well-known solutions of both the Ncs and Nqs factors.

40|$|It {{is quite}} {{legitimate}} {{for one to}} ask: Why? Are there t–c–Higgs couplings in Nature? In the Standard Model (SM), tree level flavor changing neutral couplings (FCNC) of the Higgs boson are absent, while at the one–electroweak–loop level, it is still strongly suppressed by the G. I. <b>M.</b> <b>mechanism.</b> In “standard ” two Higgs doublet models 1 (called Model I and II), FCNC Higgs couplings are removed by design, and again suppressed by the G.

Their heaviness suggests that they may hold the key to the question of mass, and as new, undiscovered particles, their properties certainly call for thorough examination. It was recently pointed out 2, 3 that, with more than one Higgs doublet, it is possible to have tree level FCNC Higgs couplings that satisfy the stringent low energy constraints, but are precisely the largest for the top quark. Two generic types of models are given. In Model III, which is basically a generalization of the model of Cheng and Sher, 4 FCNC Higgs couplings are of the form ∆ f ij mim...|$|R

40|$|IMR- 90 {{normal human}} diploid fibroblasts, {{transfected}} with a steroid inducible mouse mammary tumor virus-driven simian virus 40 T antigen, were carried through crisis to yield an immortal cell line. Growth {{was dependent on}} the presence of the inducer (dexamethasone) during both the extended precrisis life span of the cells and after immortalization. After dexamethasone removal, immortal cells divided once or twice and then accumulated in G 1. These results are best explained by a two-stage model for cellular senescence. Mortality stage 1 (M 1) causes a loss of mitogen responsiveness and arrest near the G 1 /S interface and can be bypassed or overcome by the cellular DNA synthesis-stimulating activity of T antigen. Mortality stage 2 (M 2) is an independent mechanism that is responsible for the failure of cell division during crisis. The inactivation of M 2 is a rare event, probably of mutational origin in human cells, independent of or only indirectly related to the expression of T antigen. Under this hypothesis, T-antigen-immortalized cells contain an active but bypassed <b>M</b> 1 <b>mechanism</b> and an inactivated <b>M</b> 2 <b>mechanism.</b> These cells are dependent on the continued expression of T antigen for the maintenance of immortality {{for the same reason that}} precrisis cells are dependent on T antigen for growth: both contain an active <b>M</b> 1 <b>mechanism...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{question}} of singing-voice registers {{is a complex}} topic {{which has led to}} extensive pedagogical and scientific literature. In this talk, we will present an overview of recent studies on the laryngeal nature of singing-voice registers and the way to assess it. The use of electroglottography (EGG) as a main tool to assess the laryngeal nature of a singing-voice register will be detailed. Several aspects have to be taken into account: EGG amplitude, EGG-pulse shape, and the variation of glottal parameters such as open or contact quotients. The notion of laryngeal mechanism will be introduced and related to the commonly-known registers. We will focus on the two main laryngeal <b>mechanisms</b> <b>M</b> 1 and <b>M</b> 2. Laryngeal <b>mechanism</b> <b>M</b> 1 is used in chest or male-head register. Laryngeal <b>mechanism</b> <b>M</b> 2 is used in falsetto or female-head registers. These two laryngeal mechanisms are related to the coupling or decoupling of the layered structure of the vocal folds. As the glottal-contact properties differ much between M 1 and M 2 in relation to modifications of vibrating-mass thickness and dynamics, EGG seems an adequate tool for assessing the laryngeal mechanism in use during singing. We will illustrate the applicability of this approach {{to the understanding of the}} laryngeal nature in voix mixte register. This register sweeps a frequency range where both laryngeal <b>mechanism</b> <b>M</b> 1 and M 2 could be used by a singer. Two laryngeal strategies have been identified.

40|$|In {{the first}} chapter, we {{consider}} the problem of first-best implementation in dynamic, interdependent-value environments where agents have quasi-linear preferences and private types are correlated. Our first candidate solution (I. M.) relies on methods typically seen in games with imperfect monitoring. We derive conditions under which this approach gives the planner the flexibility to implement efficient mechanisms that are ex-post budget balanced and collusion proof. If agents are required to make one final payment after they exit the system, the I. <b>M.</b> <b>mechanism</b> can also satisfy individual rationality and adapt to finite horizon settings. When such payments cannot be enforced, but a cyclic monotonicity condition is satisfied, the planner may adopt our second mechanism (P. A.). This alternative approach employs a technique originally developed for surplus extraction in static auctions. It allows the planner to align every agent’s preferences with his own and implement socially optimal outcomes while satisfying ex-ante budget balance and individual rationality. Both mechanisms permit the planner to implement any sharing rule when redistributing surplus. In the second chapter (co-authored with Sambuddha Ghosh), we examine a parado...|$|R
