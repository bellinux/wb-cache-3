Therefore, in this study, we have considered these concerns when designing the strategy to introduce security aspects to the protocol.

40|$|Abstract: The all-IP based {{architecture}} for 3 G {{networks and}} beyond {{will rely on}} a number of different access technologies, working seamlessly to support numerous services and applications. Security provisioning is an essential requirement in any such all-embracing network but this introduces an additional delay component to the total handoff delay crucially affecting the prime objective towards seamless mobility. In this paper we present a context transfer solution for seamless and secure multimedia services over all-IP infrastructures. The solution will act as an adhesive between the AAA and <b>mobility</b> <b>management</b> <b>message</b> exchanges by using the latter to forward AAA state information locally. For such a solution existing messages cellular IP were used as triggers and additional messages were introduced to carry the desired AAA context information. The results have shown that the overall handoff delay is reduced by approximately a factor of twenty. Additional results demonstrate the effect of AAA Context Transfer on multimedia services when integrated with the interworking mobility solution of SIP/Cellular IP [1]. ...|$|E

30|$|All of the {{aforementioned}} works show significant performance improvements in terms of resource management, however, technical challenges still exist, especially when the envisioned 5 G HetNet architecture is taken into consideration. Firstly, the uncoordinated Wi-Fi cells will be deployed overlay to the heterogeneous cellular cells [12, 13], resultantly, resource management will be challenging in this two-tier architecture. Secondly, offloaded data will be routed directly to Internet through the Wi-Fi backbone, which is not under control of the wireless operators since the Wi-Fi networks are usually owned by third parties. Consequently, the operators are unwilling to lose control over the valuable subscriber information [1], {{not to mention the}} security risks introduced due to the loosely controlled nature of the Wi-Fi networks. Moreover, existing network protocols have been designed for current levels of network density, and thus, they will become the performance bottlenecks in case of the highly densified small cell deployments in 5 G. For example, existing load balancing algorithms are mostly distributed, which causes ping-pong handovers {{due to the lack of}} global information [14].

These protocols achieve different handoff performance for different types of applications. In this paper, mobile applications are grouped into five different classes, Class A through Class E, based on their <b>mobility</b> <b>management</b> requirements. Analytical models are developed to investigate the handoff performance of the existing <b>mobility</b> <b>management</b> protocols for these application classes. The analysis shows that applications of a particular class experience different handoff performance when different <b>mobility</b> <b>management</b> protocols are used. Handoff performance comparisons of different <b>mobility</b> <b>management</b> protocols are carried out to decide on the suitable <b>mobility</b> <b>management</b> protocol for a particular application class. The results of mathematical analysis advocate the use of transport layer <b>mobility</b> <b>management</b> for Class B and Class C applications, Mobile IP for non-real-time Class D and Class E applications, and Session Initiation Protocol-based <b>mobility</b> <b>management</b> for real-time Class D and Class E applications.

In this paper, a spectrum-aware <b>mobility</b> <b>management</b> scheme is proposed for CR cellular networks. First, a novel network architecture is introduced to mitigate heterogeneous spectrum availability. Based on this architecture, a unified <b>mobility</b> <b>management</b> framework is developed to support diverse mobility events in CR networks, which consists of spectrum <b>mobility</b> <b>management,</b> user <b>mobility</b> <b>management,</b> and intercell resource allocation. The spectrum <b>mobility</b> <b>management</b> scheme determines a target cell and spectrum band for CR users adaptively dependent on time-varying spectrum opportunities, leading to increase in cell capacity. In the user <b>mobility</b> <b>management</b> scheme, a mobile user selects a proper handoff mechanism so as to minimize a switching latency at the cell boundary by considering spatially heterogeneous spectrum availability.
