5|$|Forensic {{entomology}} <b>makes</b> <b>use</b> of scorpionflies' {{habit of}} feeding on human corpses. Scorpionflies {{were the first}} insects {{to arrive at a}} donated human cadaver, and remained on the corpse for one and a half days. The presence of scorpionflies thus indicates that a body must be fresh.|$|E

5|$|Richard Wesley Hamming (February 11, 1915 – January 7, 1998) was an American {{mathematician}} {{whose work}} had many implications for computer engineering and telecommunications. His contributions include the Hamming code (which <b>makes</b> <b>use</b> of a Hamming matrix), the Hamming window, Hamming numbers, sphere-packing (or Hamming bound), and the Hamming distance.|$|E

His work contributed to the Google Ngram Viewer, released in December 2010, which <b>makes</b> <b>use</b> of culturomics ideas to produce normalized historical trends for any sequence of letters. This project published a number of findings in the journal Science, including the changing dynamic of fame and instances of literary censorship during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{have been}} a part of human culture, in the broad sense of social behaviour, customs and {{practices}} including but not limited to expressive forms such as art, music and religion, for thousands of years. Human society <b>makes</b> <b>use</b> of birds both economically, including for food, and non-economically, for sport, pleasure, and inspiration.|$|E
5|$|Chrysippus is {{the first}} Stoic for whom the third of the four Stoic categories, i.e. the {{category}} somehow disposed is attested. In the surviving evidence, Chrysippus frequently <b>makes</b> <b>use</b> of the categories of substance and quality, but makes little use {{of the other two}} Stoic categories (somehow disposed and somehow disposed in relation to something). It is not clear whether the categories had any special significance for Chrysippus, and a clear doctrine of categories may be the work of later Stoics.|$|E

5|$|For giant stars, the {{atmospheric}} microturbulence {{can result in}} line broadening that is much larger than effects of rotational, effectively drowning out the signal. However, an alternate approach can be employed that <b>makes</b> <b>use</b> of gravitational microlensing events. These occur when a massive object passes {{in front of the}} more distant star and functions like a lens, briefly magnifying the image. The more detailed information gathered by this means allows the effects of microturbulence to be distinguished from rotation.|$|E
5|$|Grid {{computing}} is {{the most}} distributed form of parallel computing. It <b>makes</b> <b>use</b> of computers communicating over the Internet {{to work on a}} given problem. Because of the low bandwidth and extremely high latency available on the Internet, distributed computing typically deals only with embarrassingly parallel problems. Many distributed computing applications have been created, of which SETI@home and Folding@home are the best-known examples.|$|E
5|$|Luciferin-luciferase {{reactions}} {{are not the}} only way that organisms produce light. The parchment worm Chaetopterus (a marine Polychaete) <b>makes</b> <b>use</b> of another photoprotein, aequorin, instead of luciferase. When calcium ions are added, the aequorin's rapid catalysis creates a brief flash quite unlike the prolonged glow produced by luciferase. In a second, much slower, step luciferin is regenerated from the oxidised (oxyluciferin) form, allowing it to recombine with aequorin, in readiness for a subsequent flash. Photoproteins are thus enzymes, but with unusual reaction kinetics.|$|E
