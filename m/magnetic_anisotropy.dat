2500|$|The ferrous cube complex Fe4C40H52N4O12 (commonly called [...] ) was {{the first}} example of a single-molecule magnet {{involving}} an Fe(II) cluster, and {{the core of this}} complex is a slightly distorted cube with Fe and O atoms on alternating corners. Remarkably, this single-molecule magnet exhibits non-collinear magnetism, in which the atomic spin moments of the four Fe atoms point in opposite directions along two nearly perpendicular axes. Theoretical computations showed that approximately two magnetic electrons are localized on each Fe atom, with the other atoms being nearly nonmagnetic, and the spin–orbit-coupling potential energy surface has three local energy minima with a <b>magnetic</b> <b>anisotropy</b> barrier just below 3 meV.|$|E

A strong in-plane uniaxial <b>anisotropy</b> with <b>magnetic</b> hard axis along the [1 (1) over bar 0] crystallographic direction is present at the GaAs/Fe(001) interface while a weak in-plane uniaxial anisotropy for the Fe grown on Au has its easy axis oriented along [1 (1) over bar 0]. A linear dependence of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>anisotropies</b> as a function of temperature suggests that the strength of the in-plane uniaxial anisotropy is affected by the magnetoelastic anisotropies and differential thermal expansion of contacting materials.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Magnetization {{reversal}} {{properties in}} thin-films and patterned nanostructures {{are essential for}} various modern magnetic devices. The magnetization reversal {{is determined by the}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>anisotropies</b> of the system, which can come from different origins. Specifically, the exchange bias, also known as the exchange anisotropy, brings in a shift of the magnetic hysteresis loop which has been widely applied in magnetic recording technologies and magnetic sensors. In an exchange bias system, other types of <b>magnetic</b> <b>anisotropies,</b> such as the magnetocrystalline anisotropy or the shape anisotropy, can be present and interacts with the exchange anisotropy thus affecting the magnetic reversal cooperatively. In order to study the competing <b>magnetic</b> <b>anisotropies</b> in the exchange bias system, we have developed approaches to grow epitaxial exchange-biased ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic thin-film bilayers, which bring significant magnetocrystalline anisotropy into the exchange bias system. We studied the magnetization reversal of these bilayers using magneto-optic Kerr effect and anisotropic magnetoresistance, and investigated systematically the dependence of <b>magnetic</b> <b>anisotropies</b> on various sample parameters, including layer thickness, temperature, relative orientation, interfacial spin behavior, and the antiferromagnetic bulk structure. To explain the samples' unique magnetic behaviors, we developed a quantitative model based on magnetic domain-wall nucleation and propagation process, and offered a consistent and integrated interpretation on the magnetic reversal properties. To further incorporate the shape anisotropy into the exchange bias system, we developed a large-area, efficient epitaxial patterning process using nanoimprint lithography, which allows us to pattern epitaxial magnetic thin-film bilayer and multilayers into nanostructures. By combining the bilayer-resist template and Molybdenum liftoff, we are able to create high-quality, patterned structures with different sizes ranging from ~ 70 nano-meter to ~ 5 micro-meter. The magnetization reversals, especially the domain-wall structures during the reversal, are subsequently studied by hysteresis loop measurements and direct imaging techniques. Finally, in addition to fundamental studies on the magnetic reversal, the nanoimprint processes developed for this thesis can also find great potential in relevant industries...|$|R

50|$|The {{concentration}} of poles {{depends on the}} direction of magnetization (see the figure).

40|$|The {{macroscopic}} {{magnetic moment}} of a superparamagnetic {{system has to}} overcome an energy barrier in order to switch its direction. This barrier is formed by <b>magnetic</b> <b>anisotropies</b> in the material and may be surmounted typically after 10 ^ 9 to 10 ^ 12 attempts per second by thermal fluctuations. In a first step, the associated switching rate may be described by a Neel-Brown-Arrhenius law, in which the energy barrier is assumed as constant or a given temperature. Yet, <b>magnetic</b> <b>anisotropies</b> in general depend on temperature themselves which is known to modify the Neel-Brown-Arrhenius law. We illustrate quantitatively the implications of a temperature-dependent anisotropy on the switching rate and in particular for {{the interpretation of the}} prefactor as an attempt frequency.

50|$|Although the {{exchange}} interaction keeps spins aligned, {{it does not}} align them in a particular direction. Without <b>magnetic</b> <b>anisotropy,</b> the spins in a magnet randomly change direction in response to thermal fluctuations and the magnet is superparamagnetic. There are several kinds of <b>magnetic</b> <b>anisotropy,</b> {{the most common of}} which is magnetocrystalline anisotropy. This is a dependence of the energy on the direction of magnetization relative to the crystallographic lattice. Another common source of anisotropy, inverse magnetostriction, is induced by internal strains. Single-domain magnets also can have a shape anisotropy due to the magnetostatic effects of the particle shape. As the temperature of a magnet increases, the anisotropy tends to decrease, and there is often a blocking temperature at which a transition to superparamagnetism occurs.|$|E
