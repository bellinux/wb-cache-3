25|$|The subject {{upon which}} you have written to me {{is one in which}} I {{naturally}} take a more than common interest. Not only was I one of the Oxford Crew in the first Inter-University Boat-Race in 1829, but the Race was entirely set up by me, owing to the fact that though I was myself at Christ Church, Oxford, my home was at Cambridge (my father being Master of Trinity), and I had a large acquaintance there, and some-times (especially in Easter vacations) was invited to pull in one of their boats, e. g. that of St John's, in which were the now Bishops, Selwyn and Tyrrell, and Charles Merivale the historian, all now vigorous and flourishing. I may also mention, as bearing upon your enquiry, that as soon as my father heard that I had been chosen one of the Oxford Eight, and was practising for the Race, he wrote me an earnest letter, in which he desired me not to row any more, simply from anxiety lest my health should suffer. Though I was always much given to athletic exercises, even before I went to Harrow (where I was one of the Eleven in the first Matches against Eton, for four years, 1822 – 1825), my constitution was in some respects rather a delicate one. When I received his letter I went at once to my physician, told him the difficulty in which I was placed, begged him to examine my state of health, and got his authority to assure <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>that</b> so far as he could judge, rowing had not done me any harm. By this my father was satisfied, and I was allowed to go on. The Race itself, which was at Henley (two miles up stream), certainly did me no harm, though at the time I was incommoded by the change to an unusual diet, — under-done beefsteaks, porter, dry bread, no butter, no tea, no vegetables. After the Race, which was on Wednesday or Tuesday (I think), I was able to play cricket, as one of the Eleven also, against Cambridge on the following Friday. The match was at Oxford. We were victorious on both occasions.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{a picture}} in First They Killed <b>My</b> <b>Father</b> <b>that</b> was {{supposedly}} taken [...] "on a family trip to Angkor Wat" [...] in 1973 or 1974. A civil war had been in progress in Cambodia since 1970 and the Khmer Rouge was in control of Siem Reap (the location of Angkor Wat) from 1973 onward. Critics state {{that it is not}} likely that Ung's family would be vacationing at that time in that region of Cambodia, that the picture was taken at Wat Phnom, which is in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, and that Ung's memory is therefore unreliable.|$|E
2500|$|On Golden Pond in 1981, {{the film}} {{adaptation}} of Ernest Thompson's play, marked one final {{professional and personal}} triumph for Fonda. [...] Directed by Mark Rydell, the project provided unprecedented collaborations between Fonda and Katharine Hepburn, along with Fonda and his daughter, Jane. [...] The elder Fonda played an emotionally brittle and distant father who becomes more accessible {{at the end of}} his life. [...] Jane Fonda has said that elements of the story mimicked their real-life relationship, and helped them resolve certain issues. She bought the film rights in the hope that her father would play the role, and later described it as [...] "a gift to <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>that</b> was so unbelievably successful." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{his speech}} on July 20, {{the third day}} of the convention, Cruz congratulated Trump but did not endorse him and told {{listeners}} to [...] "vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution". The speech was met with boos and a negative reception among the crowd. The following day at the Texas Republican delegation breakfast, Cruz defended his choice to not endorse Trump: [...] "I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> <b>That</b> pledge was not a blanket commitment that if you go and slander and attack Heidi, that I'm going to nonetheless come like a servile puppy dog and say, 'Thank you very much for maligning my wife and maligning my father.'" [...] Two months later, on September 23, 2016, Cruz publicly endorsed Trump for president.|$|E
2500|$|Congregants {{stood for}} the {{proclamation}} of the Gospel, heralded by {{the singing of}} Alleluia. After being blessed by Ratzinger, an English deacon of the Archdiocese of Birmingham, Paul Moss (who has now been ordained priest and is currently serving as Vocations Director for the Archdiocese of Birmingham), proceeded with the Book of the Gospels to the ambo or lectern. He began by singing, [...] "The Gospel according to John." [...] Congregants replied, [...] "Glory to you, O Lord." [...] Moss then incensed the Book of the Gospel and then sang the reading in Latin. The reading came from John chapter 6, verse 40, stating, [...] "For this is the will of <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>that</b> everyone who sees the son and believes in him may have eternal life." [...] Moss then read from John chapter 21, verses 15 through 19, which is an account of a dialogue between Jesus and Saint Peter. Jesus asked three times, [...] "Do you love me?" [...] He then told his disciple, [...] "Follow me." [...] The deacon raised the Book of the Gospel and sang, [...] "Verbum Domini" [...] or [...] "The Gospel of the Lord." [...] Congregants replied in chant, [...] "Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ." ...|$|E
