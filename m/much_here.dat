500|$|The Washington Post stated, [...] "There's too <b>much</b> <b>here.</b> Yet it's {{the most}} {{interesting}} NIN in years." [...] The review went on to describe each track as [...] "the sonic equivalent of a silver orb hovering {{in your living room}} [...] explodes into a million shiny balls of mercury that splash to the floor before trickling, magnetically, back into a large round mass." ...|$|E
500|$|Instead {{of hunting}} big game abroad as he usually did {{over the winter}} months, Gordon-Cumming {{remained}} in Britain, and spent time in London and at his Scottish estate. He was also seen {{in the presence of}} an American heiress, Florence Garner, and the two became engaged. On 27 December he received an anonymous message from Paris that read: [...] "they are beginning to talk <b>much</b> <b>here</b> of... your sad adventure... They have talked too much in England. He sent the message to Williams and asked him to let the prince know the contents.|$|E
500|$|The Blu-ray {{version was}} {{released}} on 2 December 2008. It contains audio in English, French, Portuguese, Spanish, and Thai, and subtitles in 10 languages. Glenn Erickson of DVD Talk also criticized the film, yet praised the Blu-ray release, rating it 4½ [...] stars out of 5 for its video quality and 4 out of 5 for its audio, though only giving it 1½ stars for its extras, noting the lack of special features. A review from Blu-Ray.com also gave a favourable review of both the audio and visual quality, stating [...] "I don't {{think that there is}} <b>much</b> <b>here</b> one could be dissatisfied with." [...] High-Def Digest, however, gave a more negative review. Whilst praising the audio quality, the lack of special features was criticized, as was the video quality, which was described as being [...] "smothered" [...] with edge enhancement. The reviewer concluded, [...] "Sony is practically begging people not to buy it." ...|$|E

500|$|Eric Ford, also of TouchArcade, {{found the}} {{gameplay}} [...] "basic" [...] as well—"not <b>much</b> <b>here</b> that truly innovates within the genre"—but {{felt that the}} game was worth experiencing for its [...] "excellent visual style and soundtrack". He, too, compared the gameplay to Ski Safari and wrote that while the game's power-ups, quest objectives, currency, and score were [...] "pretty standard", the trick system was praiseworthy and gave even easy tricks a sense of [...] "accomplishment". Ford was not enticed by the available upgrades and wrote that he played not for the upgrades but for the game's [...] "whole look and feel" [...] that was made to feel like more than a game with its [...] "awesome", [...] "mellow", and [...] "soothing" [...] soundtrack. Ford added that the game earned [...] "its hype" [...] from its [...] "amazing art style and visual effects" [...] rather than from its gameplay. He was impressed with how much the dynamic weather changed {{the feel of the}} game even while the gameplay went unchanged. Ford predicted that players would respond to Alto's Adventure either in appreciation of its [...] "sheer amount of artistic integrity and nuanced visuals", or in disappointment by its similarity to previous endless runners.|$|E
500|$|Along with Blue Lines, Maxinquaye {{was hailed}} by journalists as the pivotal release {{in what they}} were calling [...] "trip hop" [...] music; Jon Pareles, the chief critic at The New York Times, called it the genre's [...] "first album-length masterpiece". Tricky disliked the term, saying [...] "I was {{supposed}} to have invented trip hop, and I will fucking deny having anything to do with it". In a retrospective review for Stylus Magazine, Hebert argued that [...] "there's too <b>much</b> <b>here</b> to be sequestered to any genre, let alone that one... Calling Tricky 'trip-hop' is a bit like calling Prince 'pop'. It's partially accurate, but the music is so much better than that." [...] In Mojo, Victoria Segal later called Maxinquaye [...] "an exotic, erotic alien that nobody (not least its creator) has managed to clone". It was dubbed [...] "the British postmodern album of the 90s" [...] by Jason Draper of Record Collector and [...] "a visionary post-rock statement" [...] by The Philadelphia Inquirers Tom Moon, while AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine said it remained [...] "a bracing sonic adventure that gains richness and resonance with each listen" [...] because of the songs' imaginative structures and exceptional use of [...] "noise and experimental music". In The Village Voice, Christgau believed its significance lied in an aesthetic of cool derived from the blues and African-American culture, which valued a self-possessed resolve in the face of oppression: ...|$|E
2500|$|The album has {{received}} mainly positive reviews, gaining 74/100 on Metacritic from twelve reviews. Artist Direct singled out the album as the band's [...] "best album to date". Allmusic criticized the album for being [...] "a {{bit of a}} mess" [...] due to the scale of its ambition, though it acknowledged {{that this could be}} forgiven as there is [...] "so <b>much</b> <b>here</b> that works". Both The A.V. Club and Sputnikmusic rated the album as a step forward for the band.|$|E

The New York Daily News said of the series: [...] "Lifetime's new Against the Wall {{turns out to be}} first-rate drama. In fact, it's one of the best new shows of the year." [...] The Los Angeles Times gave a positive review: [...] "There's <b>much</b> <b>here</b> to suggest that, if everyone relaxes a little, good things will come."

2500|$|In his {{retirement}} Heathcote devised {{improvements in the}} arrangement of staysails, taking out a patent in 1823, and publishing his theory in a treatise in 1824 entitled Treatise on Stay-Sails, For the Purpose of Intercepting Wind Between the Square-Sails of Ships and Other Square-Rigged Vessels, Mathematically Demonstrating the Superiority of the Improved Patent Stay-Sails, Recently Invented by Captain Sir Henry Heathcote. The work was reviewed by The Naval and Military Magazine, which came to the opinion that [...] "However elaborate the diagrams, practical proofs must always be preferred on professional points; and, though the baronet [...] is backed by Euclid, and assures his readers he is supported in his theory by the opinions of experienced officers, {{it is not too}} <b>much</b> <b>here</b> to assert, that the majority of both the new and old school will dispute the utility of staysails, in any shape, set 'upon a wind;' and few, it is presumed, will approve of the cut of Sir Henry's jib." [...] Despite this, Heathcote's obituary reported that 'the plan was tried aboard two frigates, and was reported by the Admiralty of being worthy of its acceptance.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Killian Fox of The Observer said, [...] "not <b>much</b> <b>here</b> is new", [...] "the album {{tries to}} justify its bulky existence", [...] "but they add little to a {{catalogue}} of music {{that has already been}} superbly produced." [...] Arwa Haider from metro.co.uk said, [...] "the original songs are obviously fantastic", but [...] "without the accompanying Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, these slightly spooky mixes don't add much to his canon. [...] " [...] Michael Langston Moore from African American Entertainment Examiner said the album [...] "deemed to be a bit sacrilege". Gary Trust and Keith Caulfield from Billboard pointed out that [...] "consumers surely didn't seem that interested in the mash-up style album." [...] Nekesa Mumbi Moody from The Associated Press said, [...] "much of the album seems disjointed. Some songs are oddly chopped up, others are spliced together without much finesse, and there are a myriad of sound effects — bullets firing, glass shattering, the whistle of a train, basketballs bouncing — that just sound like noise," [...] and [...] "on stage, it probably all makes sense beautifully", [...] "but without that visual picture, the listening experience is a disappointment." ...|$|E

But none of this makes the arbitrary deaths, the ludicrous behavior, or the pages upon pages about corpse-rot and vivisection any easier to deal with.
