50|$|In the 17th century, mirrors {{were among}} the most {{expensive}} items to possess at the time; the Venetian Republic held the monopoly on the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>mirrors.</b> In order to maintain the integrity of his philosophy of mercantilism, which required that all items used in the decoration of Versailles be made in France, Jean-Baptiste Colbert enticed several workers from Venice to make mirrors at the Manufacture royale de glaces de miroirs. According to legend, in order to keep its monopoly, the government of the Venetian Republic sent agents to France to poison the workers whom Colbert had brought to France.|$|E
50|$|The process {{involved}} {{blowing a}} glass cylinder, slitting it lengthwise, and {{allowing it to}} open to a flat sheet in an oven. It was then ground and polished to achieve a thin sheet with a flat surface. In later years the blowing process was superseded by the casting process. Most of his glass plate, up to 1 metre in size, {{was used for the}} <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>mirrors</b> and coach windows and was eventually of better quality that could be imported. Around 1680 they were joined by George Ravenscroft, inventor of the more durable lead crystal glass, who worked there until his death in 1683.|$|E
5000|$|To {{counter the}} costs of Versailles {{during the early years}} of Louis XIV's {{personal}} reign, Colbert decided that Versailles should be the [...] "showcase" [...] of France. Accordingly, all materials that went into the construction and decoration of Versailles were manufactured in France. Even the mirrors used in the decoration of the Hall of Mirrors were made in France. While Venice in the 17th century had the monopoly on the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>mirrors,</b> Colbert succeeded in enticing a number of artisans from Venice to make the mirrors for Versailles. However, owing to Venetian proprietary claims on the technology of mirror manufacture, the Venetian government ordered the assassination of the artisans to keep the secrets proprietary to the Venetian Republic. To meet the demands for decorating and furnishing Versailles, Colbert nationalised the tapestry factory owned by the Gobelin family, to become the Manufacture royale des Gobelins.|$|E

40|$|The <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>mirrors</b> {{for space}} {{application}} is expensive and the requirements on the optical performance increase over years.

We used 75 x 25 mm Desag D 263 glass foils 0. 75 mm thick and 0. 6 mm thick Si foils. The glass foils were shaped by free slumping on a frame at viscosities {{in the range of}} 109. 3 - 1012 dPa·s, the Si foils by forced slumping above 1000 °C. Using a Nikon D 80 digital camera, we took snapshots of a foil’s shape every 5 min during its isothermal heat treatment. The obtained results we can use for computer simulations. By comparing the measured and simulated data, we can more precisely define material properties of the foils and optimize the forming technology.

50|$|A {{dielectric}} mirror, {{also known}} as a Bragg mirror, is a type <b>of</b> <b>mirror</b> composed <b>of</b> multiple thin layers of dielectric material, typically deposited on a substrate of glass or some other optical material. By careful choice of the type and thickness of the dielectric layers, one can design an optical coating with specified reflectivity at different wavelengths <b>of</b> light. Dielectric <b>mirrors</b> are also used to produce ultra-high reflectivity mirrors: values of 99.999% or better over a narrow range of wavelengths can be produced using special techniques. Alternatively, they can be made to reflect a broad spectrum of light, such as the entire visible range or the spectrum of the Ti-sapphire laser. <b>Mirrors</b> <b>of</b> this type are very common in optics experiments, due to improved techniques that allow inexpensive <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> high-quality <b>mirrors.</b> Examples <b>of</b> their applications include laser cavity end mirrors, hot and cold mirrors, thin-film beamsplitters, and the coatings on modern mirrorshades.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the modeling and <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> bimorph <b>mirrors</b> {{as well as}} an example of their application. A general review of adaptive optics is provided, paying particular attention to those technologies which would allow adaptive optics to be employed in non-astronomical situations. The first stage of the theoretical analysis <b>of</b> the bimorph <b>mirror</b> involves developing a mechanical model of the laminated structure. This is carried out using standard thin plate laminate theory; this results in expressions for the overall sensitivity <b>of</b> a bimorph <b>mirror.</b> The mechanical model also leads to an equation describing the response of the surface <b>of</b> the <b>mirror</b> to a given applied voltage. An analytical solution is developed, and its implementation described. Using this analytical solution, the performance <b>of</b> a bimorph <b>mirror</b> under various operating conditions is analysed. Particular attention is paid to the case of correcting phase fluctuations that have a Kolmogorov spectrum. The process <b>of</b> manufacturing bimorph <b>mirrors</b> is described in some detail, and results of this procedure are presented.

60|$|I {{have told}} you how the Venetians kept glass-making a secret, and how, at last, the Germans learned it, and then the French, and their work came to be better liked {{than that of the}} Venetians.

Several young glass-makers went from France to Venice, and applied to all the looking-glass makers of Venice for situations as workmen, that they might learn the art. But all positively refused to receive them, and kept their doors and windows tightly closed while they were at work, that no one might see what they did. The young Frenchmen took advantage of this, and climbed up on the roofs, and cautiously made holes through which they could look; and thus they learned the carefully-kept secret, and went back to France and commenced the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> glass <b>mirrors.</b> Twenty years after, a Frenchman invented founding glass, which gave France such a great advantage that the trade of Venice in looking-glasses was ruined.|$|R
40|$|Telescope mirrors {{determine}} the imaging quality and observation ability of telescopes. Unfortunately, manufacturing highly accurate mirrors remains a bottleneck problem in space optics. One main {{factor is the}} lack of a technique for measuring the 3 D shapes <b>of</b> <b>mirrors</b> accurately for inverse engineering. Researchers have studied and developed techniques for testing the quality <b>of</b> telescope <b>mirrors</b> and methods for measuring the 3 D shapes <b>of</b> <b>mirrors</b> for centuries. Among these, interferometers have become popular in evaluating the surface errors <b>of</b> <b>manufactured</b> <b>mirrors.</b> However, interferometers are unable to measure some important mirror parameters directly and accurately, e. g. the paraxial radius, geometry dimension and eccentric errors, and these parameters are essential for mirror manufacturing. In this paper, we aim to remove the noise and lens distortion inherent in the system to improve the accuracy of a previously proposed one-shot projection mirror measurement method. To this end, we propose a ray modeling and a pattern modeling method. The experimental results show that the proposed ray modeling and pattern modeling method can improve the accuracy of the one-shot projection method significantly, making it feasible as a commercial device to measure the shapes <b>of</b> <b>mirrors</b> quantitatively and accurately...|$|R
30|$|Obsidian {{hydration}} is a {{very slow}} but inexorable natural process. The measurement of the hydrated layer thickness has been used since 1960 as a geochemical method for determining the age of obsidian archaeological artefacts [37 – 39]. Friedman et al. [36] determined that the hydration rates of obsidian depend primarily on temperature. In their study, the hydration rate of obsidian samples exposed to different climatic conditions was measured and compared. Their results proved that the thickness of a hydration layer on obsidian samples exposed to temperate climates (that is, the temperature conditions {{that can be found}} in Pompeii) grew at a rate of 4.5 – 6.5  µm every 1000  years. Considering that Pompeian artefacts are at least 2000  years old, the superficial hydration layer thickness <b>of</b> obsidian <b>mirrors</b> is likely to be approximately 10 – 20  μm. In addition to explaining the origin of the detected hydrogen, it provides further evidence of the use of obsidian for the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> the two <b>mirrors.</b>|$|R

40|$|Two {{types of}} film {{thickness}} standards have been developed, manufactured and investigated - for X-ray reflectometry (XRR), X-ray fluorescence analysis (XRR), electron probe microanalysis (EMPA) {{on the one}} hand, and ellipsometry on the other. Metrological characterisation of both specific kinds of material measures and investigation results achieved are reported. The standards for XRR, XRF, EMPA consist of quarts substrate coated with Pt resp. a C-Ni-C-layer-system with a nominal metal layers thickness of 10 nm alternatively 50 nm. An established process for <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> X-ray <b>mirrors</b> was used for coating. XRR {{proved to be the}} dominant investigation method.

The standards for calibration of ellipsometer used for film thickness determination consist of an S i-substrate and an SiO 2 -film.

40|$|Relatively {{inexpensive}} processes {{have been}} developed for manufacturing lightweight, wide-aperture mirrors that consist mainly of reflectively coated, edge-supported polyimide membranes. The polyimide and other materials in these mirrors can withstand the environment of outer space, and the mirrors have other characteristics that make them attractive for use on Earth as well as in outer space: With respect to the smoothness of their surfaces and the accuracy with which they retain their shapes, these mirrors approach the optical quality of heavier, more expensive conventional mirrors. Unlike conventional mirrors, these mirrors can be stowed compactly and later deployed to their full sizes. In typical cases, deployment would be effected by inflation. Potential terrestrial and outer-space applications for these mirrors include large astronomical telescopes, solar concentrators for generating electric power and thermal power, and microwave reflectors for communication, radar, and short-distance transmission of electric power. The relatively low cost <b>of</b> manufacturing these <b>mirrors</b> stems, in part, from the use of inexpensive tooling. Unlike in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> conventional <b>mirrors,</b> {{there is no need for}} mandrels or molds that have highly precise surface figures and highly polished surfaces. The surface smoothness is an inherent property of a polyimide film. The shaped area of the film is never placed in contact with a mold or mandrel surface: Instead the shape <b>of</b> a <b>mirror</b> is determined by a combination of (1) the shape of a fixture that holds the film around its edge and (2) control of manufacturing- process parameters. In a demonstration of this manufacturing concept, spherical mirrors having aperture diameters of 0. 5 and 1. 0 m were fabricated from polyimide films having thicknesses ranging from < 20 m to 150 m. These mirrors have been found to maintain their preformed shapes following deployment...|$|R

Non-Gaussian beam configurations have never been tested before [2] hence the main motivation of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of this new concept. A 7 m rigid suspended Fabry-Perot (FP) cavity which can support a scaled version of a Mesa beam applicable to the LIGO interferometers has been developed.

40|$|The {{findings}} of the Hubble Space Telescope Optical Systems Board of Investigation are reported. The Board was formed to {{determine the cause of}} the flaw in the telescope, how it occurred, and why it was not detected before launch. The Board conducted its investigation to include interviews with personnel involved in the fabrication and test of the telescope, review of documentation, and analysis and test of the equipment used in the fabrication <b>of</b> the telescope's <b>mirrors.</b> The investigation proved that the primary mirror was made in the wrong shape (a 0. 4 -wave rms wavefront error at 632. 8 nm). The primary mirror was manufactured by the Perkin-Elmer Corporation (Hughes Danbury Optical Systems, Inc.). The critical optics used as a template in shaping the mirror, the reflective null corrector (RNC), consisted <b>of</b> two small <b>mirrors</b> and a lens. This unit had been preserved by the manufacturer exactly as it was during the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> the <b>mirror.</b> When the Board measured the RNC, the lens was incorrectly spaced from the <b>mirrors.</b> Calculations <b>of</b> the effect of such displacement on the primary mirror show that the measured amount, 1. 3 mm, accounts in detail for the amount and character of the observed image blurring. No verification of the reflective null corrector's dimensions was carried out by Perkin-Elmer after the original assembly. There were, however, clear indications of the problem from auxiliary optical tests made at the time. A special optical unit called an inverse null corrector, designed to mimic the reflection from a perfect primary mirror, was built and used to align the apparatus; when so used, it clearly showed the error in the reflective null corrector. A second null corrector was used to measure the vertex radius of the finished primary mirror. It, too, clearly showed the error in the primary <b>mirror.</b> Both indicators <b>of</b> error were discounted at the time as being themselves flawed. The Perkin-Elmer plan for fabricating the primary mirror placed complete reliance on the reflective null corrector as the only test to be used in both manufacturing and verifying the mirror's surface with the required precision. This methodology should have alerted NASA management to the fragility of the process and the possibility of gross error. Such errors had been seen in other telescope programs, yet no independent tests were planned, although some simple tests to protect against major error were considered and rejected. During the critical time period, there was great concern about cost and schedule, which further inhibited consideration of independent tests...|$|R

Optical {{studies of the}} grown films are presented. Transmittance and reflectance measurements were obtained from an AVASPEC- 2048 UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 200 - 900 nm. The thickness of the films was obtained by surface profile analysis using a Dektak Veeko- 150 stylus surface profiler. The thickness obtained for the films were {{in the range of}} 1. 0 µm to 1. 45 µm depending on the dip time. Results show that the film exhibited poor transmittance and high reflectance of solar radiation in the Infra-Red (IR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum respectively.
