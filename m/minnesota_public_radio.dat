25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, during his {{conducting}} stint in Saint Paul, Minnesota, McGlaughlin often {{spoke to the}} audience before a performance, informally explaining the program and what to listen for.

MPR producer Tom Voegeli {{came up with the}} idea for a new show: Saint Paul Sunday Morning, with McGlaughlin as host. MPR had just received a public radio communications satellite uplink, as well as seed money to develop a few pilot shows for national distribution. Voegeli wanted a program which would present world-class musicians, in an informal live setting in MPR's new state-of-the-art studio, to a national audience. Voegeli also wanted McGlaughlin to sound like himself — a musician — rather than like a broadcaster, and to share his own intimate, animated enthusiasm with listeners.|$|E
