40|$|The {{inherent}} {{variability of}} seed and fertilizer application from volumetric metering devices is not readily recognized. The Canadian Prairie Agricultural Machinery Institute (P AMI) suggests a maximum {{coefficient of variation}} (CV) of 15 % among outlets for seeding grain or applying fertilizer. P AMI does not report down-the-row variability of individual outlets. Parameters that influence variability of volumetric measuring external fluted wheels such as rotational speed of the <b>metering</b> <b>wheel,</b> product delivery rate, seed size, and cell collection lengths were examined. In the first study, external fluted wheel meters on four grain drills were tested for seed delivery variability for wheat and soybeans, both among the metering outlets and down-the-row for individual meters. Tests on two additional drills, one an air drill {{and the other with}} external fluted metering, used two sizes of soybean seeds and two travel speeds. For wheat, down-the-row CV ranged from 12. 5 to 22. 5 % and the CV among metering units ranged from 12. 5 to 21 %. For soybeans, the CV ranged from 15. 5 to 41. 5 % with the air drill having the lower CV. A faster travel speed gave a lower CV for both drills metering soybeans. In a second study, when metering wheat, the seeding rate variability due to cell size and seeding rate were evaluated. Each meter was evaluated with cells 0. 48 or 0. 96 m in length and seeding rates of 60, 80, 90, and 100 kg/ha. The down-the-row CV ranged from 10 to 28 % with 0. 48 m length cells, and from 4 to 22 % with 0. 96 m length cells. Some of these CVs may be too high for a metering mechanism such as the fluted wheel to be used in SSCM...|$|E

This facility was developed to perform experiments and carry out evaluations on levitation and propulsion designs for MagLev systems currently under consideration. The facility was developed to rotate a large (2 <b>meter)</b> <b>wheel</b> which could operate with peripheral speeds of greater than 100 meters/second. The rim of the wheel was constructed of a non-magnetic, non-conductive composite material to avoid the generation of errors from spurious forces. A sensor package containing a multi-axis force and torque sensor mounted to the base of the station, provides a signal of the lift and drag forces on the package being tested. Position tables mounted on the station allow for the introduction of errors in real time. A computer controlled data acquisition system was developed around a Macintosh IIfx to record the test data and control the speed of the wheel. This paper describes the development of this test facility. A detailed description of the major components is presented.

Initially, the penetration forces acting on two different punches were evaluated in laboratory tests with two different soils and varying soil moisture contents and bulk densities. A standard cone penetrometer {{was used as a}} reference. Soil samples were prepared using PVC molds with a procedure based on the Proctor test. Bulk density was the factor that resulted in the biggest changes in penetration force. Good correlations were observed between the cone penetrometer data and punch penetration forces. A prototype punch planter for corn {{was designed}} and built using a commercial vacuum seed meter. The seed meter was evaluated in the laboratory, vertically and inclined. The prototype planter with the seed meter attached was also evaluated in the laboratory. The results were not significantly affected by the working position of the seed meter nor by speeds between 1. 0 and 3. 0 m/s for the seed meter and planter prototype. Field tests were conducted at several residue covers at 2. 0 m/s and no significant differences in plant spacings were observed. The prototype was modified to be able to plant different population rates. Seed spacings of 136, 165 and 210 mm were obtained by constructing three punch wheels with different punch lengths. Laboratory and field tests were run at speeds of 1. 5, 2. 0 and 2. 5 m/s. The field tests were run in three different residue covers (corn, grain sorghum and soybean). Despite problems with synchronization between the seed <b>meter</b> and punch <b>wheels</b> in some combinations, the length of the punches seemed to cause no significant problems at the speeds tested. A soil cleaning device was designed to reduce the soil disturbance. The volume of soil displaced by the smallest punch wheel was less than half of that displaced by a commercial no-till planter.

40|$|Site Specific Crop Management is a {{technique}} by which agricultural inputs such as seed, fertilizer and herbicides are adjusted to match the requirements of specific field areas. Agricultural machines must apply the correct application rate at each field location. One possibility is to add a controller to obtain variable rate capability from conventional metering mechanisms for uniform application. ^ Two control systems for variable rate capability with conventional grain drills were evaluated in this study. Both were operator controlled open loop systems. ^ One system used a set of rate switches. An electric linear actuator moved the meter adjustment lever and contacted limit switches for each rate setting of external fluted <b>wheel</b> <b>meters.</b> The other system used a rheostat to control the speed of an electric motor driving internal fluted <b>wheel</b> <b>meters.</b> ^ Seeding rate and rate change response were determined by operating the drills over a course of artificial turf mats. A four-parameter sigmoid model described the distribution profile. ^ The linear actuator system response time averaged 5. 6 s for a 20 kg/ha rate increase. The response time varied considerably for a 10 kg/ha increase and was inconsistent for decreased rates. ^ For rotary actuation, response times varied from 3 to 9 s depending upon the rate change magnitude. This control system performed well for rate increases and decreases. ^ Finally, theoretical guidelines were developed to characterize the transition area accompanying a change from one application rate to another. Response time was divided into (1) actuation lag and (2) actuator mechanical response. Actuation lag was greater for the linear actuator. Generally, the mechanical response was longer for decreasing rates. For a 10 kg/ha rate change, the 68 % confidence interval lower limit of the final rate overlapped the 68 % confidence interval upper limit of the initial rate. With a 20 kg/ha change, no rate overlap occurred. More variability {{was associated with the}} estimation of the inflection point of the sigmoid curve for 10 kg/ha than for 20 kg/ha. This indicates that the metering systems were less suitable for smaller rate changes. ...|$|R

The rover {{must be able to}} safely perform many tasks, ranging from transportation and reconnaissance to exploration and rescue missions. Numerous designs were considered in an effort to maintain a low overall mass and good mobility characteristics. The configuration adopted consists of two cylindrical pressure hulls passively connected by a pressurized flexible passageway. The vehicle has an overall length of 11 meters and a total mass of seven metric tons. The rover is driven by eight independently powered two <b>meter</b> diameter <b>wheels.</b> The dual-cylinder concept allows a combination of articulated frame and double Ackermann steering for executing turns. In an emergency, the individual drive motors allow the option of skid steering as well. Two wheels are connected to either side of each cylinder through a pinned bar which allows constant ground contact. Together, these systems allow the rover to easily meet its mobility requirements. A dynamic isotope power system (DIPS), in conjunction with a closed Brayton cycle, supplied the rover with a continuous supply of 8. 5 kW. The occupants are all protected from the DIPS system's radiation by a shield of tantalum. The large amount of heat produced by the DIPS and other rover systems is rejected by thermal radiators. The thermal radiators and solar collectors are located {{on the top of the}} rear cylinder. The solar collectors are used to recharge batteries for peak power periods. The rover's shell is made of graphite-epoxy coated with multi-layer insulation (MLI). The graphite-epoxy provides strength while the thermally resistant MLI gives protection from the lunar environment. An elastomer separates the two materials to compensate for the thermal mismatch. The communications system allows for communication with the lunar base with an option for direct communication with earth via a lunar satellite link. The various links are combined into one signal broadcast in the S-band at 2. 3 GHz. The rover is fitted with a parabolic reflector disk for S-band transmission, and an omnidirectional antenna for local extravehicular activity (EVA) communication. The rover's guidance, navigation, and control subsystem consists of an inertial guidance system, an orbiting lunar satellite, and an obstacle avoidance system. In addition, the rover is equipped with a number of external fixtures including two telerobotic arms, lights, cameras, EVA storage, manlocks, a docking fixture, solar panels, thermal radiators, and a scientific airlock.

The demon tells Link his history with Hylia and that {{he has no intention of}} changing his ways after centuries of punishment and neglect by the villagers who did not even bother to clean the bird droppings off it. The Horned Statue then steals one of the Heart Containers or Stamina Vessels (which the statue calls Essence) that Link obtains from trading 4 Spirit Orbs to Hylia via praying to her Goddess Statues. This results in The Statue's Bargain side quest which Link must convince the statue to return the stolen essence. The Horned Demon states that his intentions are purely business related and offers to provide Link the service of exchange Heart Containers for Stamina Vessels and vice versa. First the Statue will purchase either essence for 100 Rupees, then sell him the essence of his choice for 120 Rupees (with the statue making a 20 Rupee profit). This service allows Link to exchange either essence which increase his Heart Containers (health <b>meter)</b> and Stamina <b>Wheel</b> (used to perform actions like running, swimming, climbing, gliding, and charged attacks).

40|$|Introduction Researchers {{frequently}} include multiple cultivars {{and fertility}} levels in field experiments. Therefore, the experiments sowing operation must represent a considerable saving {{in time and}} labor, compared to hand sowing. Greater flexibility in experimental design and setup could be achieved by equipment that enables quick changes in the cultivar and fertilizer rates from one plot to the next. A satisfactory seed drill must distribute a given quantity of seed evenly over a predetermined length of coulter row, the coulters must be spaced at exact intervals and depth of sowing must be uniform. In a self-propelled type of plot seeder, no coulter should run in a wheel track as the compaction of the soil can cause observable differences in vigor between plants in such a row and those in un-compacted rows. The machine should sow in succession from a try in which a series of seed pocket separated clearly and must be put into distributer funnel by an assistant operator. The length of gap being varied according to the nature and purpose of the plot. The objectives of this experiment were 1 - to design and construct a local self-propelled plot seeder and 2 - To compare it with the imported (Wintersteiger) plot seeder in cereal breeding programs. Materials and Methods A small-plot seeder was designed and constructed to meet this objective. The unit consists of the following basic components: a toolbar for pulling a set of six blade coulter, an air compressor for lifting and putting down the openers and <b>metering</b> transmission drive <b>wheel,</b> an operators chair and work rack, one belt seed distribution. A cone-celled and rotor seed distributor is used for seed distribution to the openers. The cone system {{is connected to the}} gearbox and allows for great flexibility in changing cultivars, crop species, and plot length. This is driven by the separate drive wheel. The cone-celled distributor sows all the seed of the sample in making one complete turn. The spinner can be equipped with a 4 or 6 outlet delivery head, depending on row spacing. The planter is fitted with hoe openers. Alternatively, spear-point openers have sometimes been used under conventional tillage systems. Seeding depth control was achieved by an adjustment screw handle. The plot seeder is being moved by a 9. 6 kW engine, and has been successfully used in applications. Field experiment established by using 4 plot length (2, 3, 4 and 6) with 4 replication by the constructed plot seeder and imported plot seeder. Crop measurements were planted height, spike m- 2, seeds/spike, Thousand kernel weight, Biological and grain yield, harvest index and drill measurements were seeding depth, uniformity of row spacing in action, seed counter performance, power requirement, slippage evenly of rows after planting. Results and Discussion Results showed that there were significant differences between the plant emergences. The emergencies were higher in plots, which planted by the new plot seeder. The differences between seed distribution of openers were insignificant, but the variances of new plot seeder and imported plot seeder were 0. 267 and 1. 05 respectively. Mean planting depth of plots planted by the Wintersteiger plot seeder was 0. 8 cm shallower than the adjusted planting depth while mean planting depth in plots planted by constructing machine had only 0. 01 cm variation. Results of variance analysis revealed that effect of treatments on wheat grain yield and yield components was significant. So that, highest grain yield (4216 kgha- 1), biological yield (8704 kgha- 1), number of spikes per square meter (649 spike), obtained from a plot which planted by constructed plot seeder. Increasing yield of treatments which planted by constructed plot seeder might be because of increasing the number of spikes per square meter in those treatments. The mean of spike per square meter in plots of new planter was 691 spikes which were 116 spike more than plots planted by imported plot seeder. Conclusions The constructed plot seeder had up to 18500 cost reduction. The seeder was able to distribute the different type of seed to the seed tubes uniformly in laboratory tests, nevertheless it is necessary to test the constructed plot seeder in field condition by using different seed type and conducting new research project. Advantages of this planter include less variation of seed fall down in different coulters, perfect planting depth control, separate wheel for adjusting planting length, minimize the slippage of planter driven wheel and proper utility in different field condition. According to effects on crop parameters the constructed plot seeder had relative priority to imported one. In addition easily accessories supply and cheaper prime cost are profit of the designed and constructed plot seeder...|$|R
