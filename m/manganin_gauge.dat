As a result, the maximum attainable hydrostatic pressure is considerably lowered (to under 25 kbar; it also depends upon the sample).

40|$|The dynamic {{response}} of commercial alumina discs, with an inmaterial <b>manganin</b> <b>gauge,</b> was determined in the 30 to 100 Kb range. The shock wave {{was composed of}} an initial elastic jump to about 60 Kb and a subsequent dispersive rise to the final shock level.

Various features of the release wave were used to deduce the state of the material after passage of the shock wave. The Hugoniot Elastic Limit could be varied from 6. 0 to 7. 5 GPa solely by varying the thermal history of the alumina specimens. These changes in dynamic properties were shown to correspond to microstructural changes and were well-correlated with corresponding changes in the static fracture toughness. This correlation was explained in terms of a model for dynamic yielding based on multiple unconnected microcracking on the scale of the microstructure...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a procedure for performing parameter optimization of ignition and growth continuum models for high explosive systems. Continuum modeling of reactive flow in high explosive systems can yield highly accurate predictions of experimental observations. However, the numerical parameter optimization {{that is needed}} to establish these predictions generally requires many evaluations of a model, {{and in the case of}} continuum reactive flow models, each evaluation re-quires long run times. In terms of keeping the total number of function evalua-tions low, the variable metric sequential quadratic programming approach is at present the most efficient general nonlinear local optimization method available. In this investigation, the variable metric sequential quadratic programming code NLQPEB is coupled to the two-dimensional high rate continuum modeling pro-grams CALE and DYNA 2 D. An example parameter optimization of an ignition and growth model for the HMX-based high explosive PAX 2 A is presented.

40|$|A robust {{experimental}} design {{for measuring the}} shock-response of granular materials at ambient and higher densities is described. The method employed Lagrangian sensors embedded in anvils surrounding a sample cavity. The shock-consolidation of silica powders {{with a range of}} initial densities, structural forms of silica, morphologies, and water-content were investigated. Data on the principal Hugoniot and off-Hugoniot states were measured for: fused-silica powders of initial density ρ 00 = 0. 1, 0. 25, and 0. 77 g cm - 3, quartz-sand of varying water-content (0 %, 10 %, 20 %, and 22 % by mass), and statically compacted soil with initial density ρ 00 = 2. 29 g cm - 3. The presence of a high water-content (20 % and 22 %) between the sand grains significantly altered the shock-response of the material. For most materials a dramatic stiffening in the material behaviour was observed upon reshock, an observation consistent with data from the literature. A phenomenological description of the compaction process in terms of grain re-arrangement, particle fracture, and plastic flow is offered. The P-α compaction model in various functional forms is applied to the fused-silica data. The exponential and power-law descriptions are observed to best fit the experimental results. The state of the art of measuring lateral stress using manganin gauges is reviewed, particularly in light of recent published results from hydrocode simulations. A series of recommendations for how best to use manganin gauges to measure lateral stress is presented. These suggestions result in small modifications to current analysis techniques. An experimental investigation of the behaviour of T-gauges, a <b>manganin</b> <b>gauge</b> commonly used to measure lateral stress, is presented.

This thesis is primarily concerned with the shock response of water and of aqueous solutions of ammonium nitrate. Of particular interest are the temperatures induced through shock compression. An experimental facility, using a single stage gas gun in the ‘plate impact’ configuration, is described, along with associated experimental diagnostics. Measurements of, and improvements to, the tilt at impact are reported. The problem of shock temperature is discussed, including {{a brief review of}} the relevant literature. It is demonstrated that direct measurement of shock temperature is a complex issue that is not yet fully understood, whereas determination of temperature from an equation of state is an established technique. In a series of experiments, plate impact techniques were utilised to determine the Hugoniot and, through shock/reload experiments, the equation of state of water and aqueous solutions of ammonium nitrate. In-situ <b>manganin</b> <b>gauges</b> were used to measure stresses in the liquids and, from the arrival times of the shock wave, determine the shock velocity.

A Mie-Grüneisen equation of state was used to describe the shock/reload experiments. Approximate calculations of shock temperature are reported. Increasing ammonium nitrate concentrations resulted in greater calculated temperatures.
