In the present study we investigate the effects of functional BK channel deletion on cognition using a genetic mouse model with a knock-out of the gene for the pore forming a-subunit of the channel. We tested the F 1 generation of a hybrid SV 129 /C 57 BL 6 mouse line in which the slo 1 gene was deleted in both parent strains. We first evaluated hearing and motor function to establish the suitability of this model for cognitive testing. Auditory brain stem responses to click stimuli showed no threshold differences between knockout mice and their wild-type littermates. Despite of <b>muscular</b> <b>tremor,</b> reduced grip force, and impaired gait, knockout mice exhibited normal locomotion.

A small dose of DABK+a small dose of BK evoked a response similar to the response to a much larger dose of DABK or BK, given alone. Responses to BK were antagonized by HOE 140 whereas DALBK antagonized only responses to larger doses of BK. The combination of a small dose of DALBK with a small dose of HOE 140 abolished the response to BK.

Su presencia en familiares de primer grado de personas con {{diabetes}} tipo 1 no se ha descrito en Cuba. OBJETIVO: determinar las frecuencias de los AcTPO y ATGt en familiares de primer grado de personas con diabetes tipo 1 y su relación con algunas características clínicas, bioquímicas e inmunológicas. MÉTODOS: en un grupo de 285 sujetos se realizó la medición del AcTPO y en 262 individuos la de ATGt. Se incluyeron casos entre los 2 y 65 años de edad. Se registraron datos sobre edad, sexo, color de la piel, antecedentes personales, historia familiar de obesidad, diabetes tipo 2, enfermedad tiroidea y enfermedad celíaca. Se interrogaron síntomas y exploraron signos clínicos de enfermedad celíaca y enfermedad tiroidea autoinmune. Se determinó glucemia, insulinemia, AcTPO, ATGt y autoanticuerpos asociados a diabetes tipo 1 (AGAD y AIA- 2), así como la resistencia a la insulina mediante el índice HOMA-IR. RESULTADOS: las frecuencias de AcTPO y ATGt positivos fueron 5, 3 y 1, 9 %, respectivamente. La historia familiar de enfermedad tiroidea, el temblor muscular fino y el exoftalmos se relacionaron con la presencia de AcTPO. Malabsorción intestinal, diarrea persistente, dolor abdominal recurrente y antecedente personal de hepatopatía se asociaron con la presencia de ATGt. Se encontró asociación entre los ATGt y el AIA- 2. La resistencia a la insulina no se asoció con la presencia de AcTPO ni de ATGt. CONCLUSIONES: en los familiares de primer grado de personas con diabetes tipo 1 las frecuencias de AcTPO y ATGt son bajas. Algunos antecedentes, síntomas y signos vinculados con enfermedad celíaca y enfermedad tiroidea autoinmune pueden ser indicadores prácticos previos a la indicación de estos autoanticuerpos. INTRODUCTION: the antithyroperoxidase (TPOAb) and antitransglutaminase (tTGAb) antibodies {{are useful}} markers of autoimmune thyroid disease and celiac disease, respectively. Its presence in first-degree relatives of {{type 1 diabetes}} patients has not been described in Cuba. OBJECTIVE: to determine the TPOAb and tTGAb frequencies in first-degree relatives of type 1 diabetes patients {{and its relation to}} some clinical, biochemical and immunological features. METHODS: in a group of 285 subjects we measured TPOAb and in 262 subjects we measured tTGAb. The cases included aged between 2 and 65. Data were registered on age, sex, skin color, personal backgrounds, and a family history of obesity, type 2 diabetes, thyroid disease and celiac disease. Symptoms were look for and clinical signs of celiac disease and autoimmune thyroid disease were explored. Fasting glucose, fasting insulin, TPOAb, tTGAb and type 1 diabetes associated autoantibodies (AGAD and AIA- 2) were determined as well as the insulin resistance according the HOMA-IR index. RESULTS: the frequencies of positive TPOAb and tTGAb were of 5, 3 and 1, 9 %, respectively. The family history of thyroid disease, slight <b>muscular</b> <b>tremor</b> and exophthalmos are related to presence of TPOAb. Intestinal malabsorption, persistent diarrhea, recurrent abdominal pain and personal background of liver disease were associated with presence of tTGAb. There was an association between tTGAb and AIA- 2. Insulin resistance was not associated with the presence of both antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: in first-degree relatives of type 1 diabetes patients, frequencies of TPOAb and tTGAb are low. Some backgrounds, symptoms and signs linked to celiac disease and autoimmune thyroid disease may be practical indicators previous to perform these autoantibodies...|$|E
