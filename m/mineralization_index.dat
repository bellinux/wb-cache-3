40|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{treatment of}} leachate samples from a Portuguese intermunicipal sanitary landfill {{was carried out}} using anodic oxidation. The treatment was performed in a pilot plant that possesses an electrochemical cell, with boron-doped diamond electrodes, working in batch mode with recirculation. The influence of the applied current density and the flow rate {{on the performance of}} the electrochemical oxidation was investigated. Current density was decreased by steps, during the degradation, in order to study this effect on the efficiency of the process. For the assays run at equal flow rate and initial current intensity, chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal seems to depend mainly on the charge passed and the variation of the current density during the anodic oxidation process can reduce the energetic costs. An increase in the recirculation flow rate leads to an increase in the organic load removal rate and a consequent decrease in the energetic costs, but it decreases the nitrogen removal rate. Also, the bias between dissolved organic carbon and COD removals increases with flow rate, indicating that an increase in recirculation flow rate decreases the <b>mineralization</b> <b>index...</b>|$|E

The {{present study was}} conducted to determine if the changes in soil C and N pools and processes induced by A. longifolia persist after its removal, at the São Jacinto Dunes Nature Reserve (Portugal). Some areas had been invaded for a long time (> 20 years) and others more recently (30 %, ß-glucosaminidase activity (N <b>mineralization</b> <b>index)</b> > 60 % and potential nitrification > 95 %.

In recently invaded areas, ß-glucosaminidase activity and potential nitrification showed a marked decrease (> 54 % and > 95 %, respectively) after removal of both A. longifolia and litter. Our results suggest that after removal of an N 2 -fixing invasive tree that changes ecosystem-level processes, it takes several years before soil nutrients and processes return to pre-invasion levels, but this legacy slowly diminish, suggesting that the susceptibility of native areas to (re) invasion {{is a function of the}} time elapsed since removal.

The activities of glycosidases (alpha- and beta-glycosidases, alpha- and beta-galactosidases), amidohydrolases (amidase, arylamidase, L-glutaminase, L-asparaginase, L-aspartase), and phosphatases (acid and alkaline phosphatases, and phosphodiesterase) were assayed in soils sampled in 1996 and 1997 from four replicated cropping systems taken in corn, soybean, oats, or meadow (alfalfa) that received 0 or 180 kg N ha- 1 before corn.;Crop rotations significantly affected enzymes activities in soils at the NERC site in both years, and glycosidases only in soils at the CWRC site. The effect of N fertilization was inconsistent. Greatest activity values were in multicropping systems in meadow or oats, and the least in continuous corn or soybean systems. Enzyme activities were significantly correlated with C mic, and arylamidase and amidohydrolases significantly correlated with Nmic, in both years and sites. The amounts of N mineralized during 24 weeks of incubation at 30 °C were significantly correlated with the activities of arylamidase and amidohydrolases at both sites. The activity of arylamidase was also significantly correlated with the amounts of N mineralized in soils from six regions of North Central U. S.;An alkaline hydrolysis method for determining the total N potentially hydrolyzable in soils was evaluated. It involves determination of the NH 4 +-N produced by direct steam distillation of 1 g field-moist soil and 1 M KOH, NaOH, or LiOH or with PO 4 -B 3 O 7 buffer (pH 11. 8) successively every 5 min for 40 min. Calculated total hydrolyzable N (Nmax or No) values differed among soils, ranging from 401 to 1667 mg kg- 1 soil and accounted for 12 [...] 56 % of organic N in the soils.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{combined}} {{incorporation of}} sewage sludge (SS) and oat straw (OS) to the soil can increase straw carbon mineralization and microbial nitrogen immobilization. This hypothesis was tested in two laboratory experiments, in which SS was incorporated in the soil with and without OS. One treatment in which only straw was incorporated and a control with only soil were also evaluated. The release of CO 2 and mineral N in the soil after organic material incorporation was evaluated for 110 days. The cumulative C mineralization reached 30. 1 % for SS and 54. 7 % for OS. When these organic materials were incorporated together in the soil, straw C mineralization was not altered. About 60 % of organic N in the SS was mineralized after 110 days. This N <b>mineralization</b> <b>index</b> was {{twice as high as}} that defined by Resolution 375 / 2006 of the National Environmental Council. The combined incorporation of SS and OS in the soil caused an immobilization of microbial N of 5. 9 kg Mg- 1 of OS (mean 3. 5 kg Mg- 1). The results of this study indicated that SS did not increase straw C mineralization, but the SS rate should be adjusted to compensate for the microbial N immobilization caused by straw...|$|E
40|$|Using {{ecological}} {{signature of}} biological integrity {{as a measure}} of performance, the reclamation efficiency of waste stabilization ponds was evaluated over a period of four years in a tropical sewage treatment plant – cum fish culture consisting of two anaerobic, two facultative and four maturation ponds located serially across the sewage effluent gradient. The four maturation ponds were used for batch culture of fish. Samples of surface and bottom water as well as surface sediment were collected twice a month from different ponds of the system and examined for some nutrient cycling bacteria, primary production, chlorophyll content of micro-algae, phytoplankton, zooplankton abundance, fish growth and water quality parameters. Computation of ecological signature using aerobic <b>mineralization</b> <b>index</b> for heterotrophic and ammonifying bacteria revealed steady increase across the sewage effluent gradient. The heterotrophic and ammonifying bacterial populations appeared to have a direct function with the concentrations of chemical oxygen demand of water.

40|$|Waste {{disposal}} is {{an urgent}} problem in those Italian areas devoted to olive oil production where {{a large amount}} of olive oil waste is produced {{in a short period of}} time. Given the high organic matter and macronutrient content of olive oil waste water, its use in agriculture could help to solve the disposal problem and, at the same time, to improve the physiochemical characteristics of intensely cultivated soils. However, olive oil waste water contains noteworthy quantities of phenols, which are toxic and have bacteriostatic activity. The effects of repeated spreading of olive oil waste water on alfalfa, on soil microbial properties, and on the availability of mineral nitrogen were determined. Doses of 0, 80, and 160 m 3 ha− 1 of olive oil waste water (OW) were spread over experimental plots sown with 3 rd year alfalfa. Soil samples were collected at various intervals after OW application. The biomass, respiratory activity, metabolic quotient, <b>mineralization</b> <b>index,</b> and the potential nitrification activity (PNA) of the soil were measured. Polyphenol, organic carbon, and mineral nitrogen contents were measured on the same soil samples. In general, the spreading of OW caused slightly positive modifications to the soil microbial biomass and metabolic quotient. These modifications were temporary and disappeared as early as a few months after the treatment. The PNA, as well as the nitrate and nitrite contents, were lower in the treated plots during the vegetative cycle of alfalfa and after the last harvest, and appeared to be negatively correlated with polyphenols. The results of this experiment confirmed that the spreading of olive oil waste water on cultivated soil could be an eco‐compatible practice. Despite their origin, the OW had no toxic effects on the soil microflora, and in fact, stimulated growth and reproduction of cells. Only the PNA proved to be slightly reduced, but the yield was not negatively affected...|$|E

Precambrian pegmatites occurring as near vertical dykes have been studied, with the aim of determining their compositional features and possible economic values. Four thin sections were prepared from the pegmatites of the study area for petrographic study. A total of twenty five samples comprising whole rock pegmatites and extracts of mica were analyzed for major and trace elements using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry analytical technique (ICP-AES). Petrographic study shows that quartz, microcline, plagioclase are the main mineral constituents under transmitted light. From the results, the whole rock pegmatite is considerably siliceous, but with noticeable depletion of silica in the mica extract. Average Fe 2 O 3, Mgo, Mno, and TiO 2 values are low in all samples (< 2. 00 %). The samples are fairly enriched in Rb, Sr, Zr, but comparatively, poor in the rare metals Ta, Nb, W, Cs and Sn.

In this regard, multivariate analyses (e. g., factor analysis) are generally used to extract significant anomalous geochemical signature of the mineral deposit-type sought. In this study, we used stepwise factor analysis to generate a geochemical <b>mineralization</b> probability <b>index</b> (GMPI) through a new approach to create stream sediment geochemical evidential maps. GMPI is a weight that can be mapped, and hence, can be used as an evidential map in MPM. Using stepwise factor analysis enhances recognition of anomalous geochemical signatures, increases geochemical anomaly intensity and increases the percentage of the total explained variability of data. With the GMPI, we developed a new data-driven fuzzification technique for (a) effective assignment of weights to stream sediment geochemical anomaly classes, and (b) improving the prediction rate of mineral potential maps and consequently increasing exploration success. Furthermore, the predictive capacity of each stream sediment geochemical sample for prospecting the deposit-type sought upstream of its location can be evaluated individually using GMPI. In addition, the GMPI can be used efficiently in knowledge-driven MPMas a new exploratory data analysis tool to generate a weighted evidential map in less explored areas. In this paper, we successfully demonstrated the application of GMPI to generate a reliable geochemical evidential map for porphyry-Cu potential mapping in an area in Kerman province, southeast of Iran...|$|R
40|$|In {{postmenopausal}} osteoporosis, an {{impairment in}} enzymatic cross-links (ECL) occurs, leading {{in part to}} a decline in bone biomechanical properties. Biochemical methods by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) are currently used to measure ECL. Another method has been proposed, by Fourier Transform InfraRed Imaging (FTIRI), to measure a mature PYD/immature DHLNL cross-links ratio, using the 1660 / 1690 cm− 1 area ratio in the amide I band. However, in bone, the amide I band composition is complex (collagens, non-collagenous proteins, water vibrations) and the 1660 / 1690 cm− 1 by FTIRI has never been directly correlated with the PYD/DHLNL by HPLC. A study design using lathyritic rats, characterized by a decrease in the formation of ECL due to the inhibition of lysyl oxidase, was used {{in order to determine the}} evolution of 1660 / 1690 cm− 1 by FTIR Microspectroscopy in bone tissue and compare to the ECL quantified by HPLC. The actual amount of ECL was quantified by HPLC on cortical bone from control and lathyritic rats. The lathyritic group exhibited a decrease of 78 % of pyridinoline content compared to the control group. The 1660 / 1690 cm− 1 area ratio was increased within center bone compared to inner bone, and this was also correlated with an increase in both mineral maturity and <b>mineralization</b> <b>index.</b> However, no difference in the 1660 / 1690 cm− 1 ratio was found between control and lathyritic rats. Those results were confirmed by principal component analysis performed on multispectral infrared images. In bovine bone, in which PYD was physically destructed by UV-photolysis, the PYD/DHLNL (measured by HPLC) was strongly decreased, whereas the 1660 / 1690 cm− 1 was unmodified. In conclusion, the 1660 / 1690 cm− 1 is not related to the PYD/DHLNL ratio, but increased with age of bone mineral, suggesting that a modification of this ratio could be mainly due to a modification of the collagen secondary structure related to the mineralization process...|$|E

International efforts are actively envisaged to remediate contaminated sites as a response to adverse health effects. Popular conventional methodologies only transfer the phase of the contaminant involving cost intensive liabilities besides handling risk of the hazardous waste. Physico-chemical methods are effective for specific wastes, but are technically complex and lack public acceptance for land remediation. Ã¢Â€ÂœBioremediationÃ¢Â€Â, {{is one of the}} emerging low-cost technologies that offer the possibility to destroy various contaminants using natural biological activities. Resultant non -toxic end products due to the microbial activity and insitu applicability of this technology is gaining huge public acceptance. In the present study, composting is demonstrated as a bioremediation methodology for the stabilization of contaminated lake sediments of Hyderabad, A. P, India. Lake sediment contaminated with organics is collected from two stratums Ã¢Â€Â“ upper (0. 25 m) and lower (0. 5 m) to set up as Pile I (Upper) and Pile II (Lower) in the laboratory. Lime as a pretreatment to the lake sediments is carried out to ensure metal precipitation. The pretreated sediment is then mixed with organic and inorganic fertilizers like cow dung, poultry manure, urea and super phosphate as initial seeding amendments. Bulking agents like sawdust and other micronutrients are provided. Continuous monitoring of process control parameters like pH, moisture content, electrical conductivity, total volatile solids and various forms of nitrogen were carried out during the entire course of the study. The stability of the compost was evaluated by assessing maturity indices like C/N, Cw (water soluble carbon), CNw (Cw/Nw), nitrification index (NH 4 /NO- 3), Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), germination index, humification ratio, compost <b>mineralization</b> <b>index</b> (ash content/oxidizable carbon), sorption capacity index (CEC/oxidizable carbon). Enzyme activities of agricultural interest like urease, phosphatase, ÃŽÂ²-glucosidase, dehydrogenase and BAA-hydrolyzing protease, which are involved in the nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon cycles, were also assessed. Total content of macro and micronutrients in the final compost was also determined to assess the fertilizer value. The studies revealed that composting could be applied as a remediation technology after removing the top sediment.

40|$|Introduction: Among the {{collection}} of natural resources in the world, soil is considered {{as one of the}} most important components of the environment. Protect and improve the properties of this precious resource, requires a comprehensive and coordinated action that only through a deep understanding of quantitative (not only recognition of the quality) the origin, distribution and functionality in a natural ecosystem is possible. Many researchers believe that due to the quick reactions of soil organisms to environmental changes, soil biological survey to estimate soil quality is more important than the chemical and physical properties. For this reason, in many studies the nitrogen mineralization and microbial respiration indices are regarded. The aim of the present study were to study the direct and indirect effects of soil physicochemical characteristics on the most important biological indicators (nitrogen mineralization and microbial respiration), which has not been carefully considered up to now. This research is the first study to provide evidence to the future planning and management of soil sciences. Materials and Methods: For this, a limitation of 20 ha area of Experimental Forest Station of Tarbiat Modares University was considered. Fifty five soil samples, from the top 15 cm of soil, were taken, from which bulk density, texture, organic C, total N, cation exchange capacity (CEC), nitrogen mineralization and microbial respiration were determined at the laboratory. The data stored in Excel as a database. To determine the relationship between biological indices and soil physicochemical characteristics, correlation analysis and factor analysis using principal component analysis (PCA) were employed. To investigate all direct and indirect relationships between biological indices and different soil characteristics, path analysis (path analysis) was used. Results and Discussion: Results showed significant positive relations between biological indices and clay, organic carbon and total nitrogen, whereas the correlations of the other soil properties (bulk density, silt, sand and CEC) were insignificant. Factor analysis using of principle component analysis showed that the behavior of these two biological indices in the same territory and controlled by the same factors. Path analysis was employed to study the relationship among soil biological indices and the other soil properties. According to results, soil nitrogen mineralization is more imposed by nitrogen (0. 98) and organic carbon (0. 91) properties as direct and indirect effects respectively. Whereas the values of soil microbial respiration were affected by organic carbon (0. 89) and total nitrogen (0. 81). It can be claimed that total nitrogen and organic carbon are the most important soil properties in relation to nitrogen mineralization and microbial respiration, respectively. Regarding to the strong relationship between soil organic carbon and nitrogen and also similarly strong relationship between nitrogen and organic carbon mineralization, enhancing nitrogen mineralization is expected by the increase in organic carbon. In this regard, Nourbakhsh, et al. (2002) claimed that nitrogen mineralization is depended to soil organic nitrogen and derived from total nitrogen. In addition, there is a strong relationship between total nitrogen and soil organic carbon. So, the greater amounts of nitrogen mineralization can be related to more accumulation of organic carbon and nitrogen in topsoil (23). This result is in accordance with Wood, et al. (1990) and Norton, et al. (2003) findings (21, 30). Ebrahimi, et al. (2005) stated that if the C/N ratio is more than 30, the process immobility or nitrogen mineralization stopwill be occurred. The ratios between 20 and 30 usually settle and release of mineral nitrogen does not take place, and the balance remains. If the C/N ratio is less than 20 net release of nitrogen in the soil will increase (9). In the present study, the values of soil C/N ratio were less than 20 (mean 15. 80), so the process of nitrogen mineralization occurred in the study area. Suitable conditions for microbial activity of soil microorganism's especially adequate supply of organic carbon increased the microbial respiration in the study area. High correlation between the amount of organic carbon and microbial respiration confirmed this claim. However; it seems that the soil organic carbon is driver of microbial respiration rate. This finding is reported by different researchers (6, 7, 15, and 20). Conclusion: Path analysis as a complementary method of regression analysis and factor analysis using principal component analysis showed that the biological activity of the soil characteristics are directly affected by soil nitrogen (for nitrogen <b>mineralization</b> <b>index)</b> and organic carbon (for microbial respiration index) and other useful features influence them indirectly through strong correlation with the characteristics of nitrogen and organic carbon in soil...|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} changes in the state of {{microbial}} cenosis of Ukraine’s chernozems under irrigation. Considerable part of Ukraine’s chernozems is located in the areas where humidification is insufficient and unstable. Irrigation is a soil-reclamation measure for chernozems of Ukrainian Forest-steppe and Steppe which enables getting the assured yield, especially vegetable and fodder crops. At the same time, irrigation is a powerful anthropogenic factor that affects the soil, causes a significant transformation of many of its properties and regimes including biological ones. Often these changes are negative. The purpose of our investigation was to identify changes in the state of microbial cenoses of chernozem soils under irrigation which depend on such factors as the quality of irrigation water, the duration and intensity of irrigation, the initial properties of soil, the structure of crop rotation, usage of fertilizing systems and agroameliorative techniques. We identified direction and evaluated a degree of changes in biological properties of chernozems under influence of irrigation in different agro-irrigational and soil-climatic conditions. In the long-term stationary field experiments we identified the following biological indices of irrigated soils and their non-irrigated analogues: a number of microorganisms which belong to main ecological-trophic groups, activity of soil enzymes (dehydrogenase, invertase, phenol oxidase), soil phytotoxic activity, cellulose destroying capacity of soil, indices of oligotrophy and <b>mineralization,</b> summary biological <b>index</b> (SBI) and index of biological degradation (BDI). Results of researches showed that irrigation unbalanced the soil ecosystem and stipulated the forming of microbial cenosis with new parameters. Long-term intensive irrigation of typical chernozem (Kharkiv Region) with fresh water under condition of 4 -fields vegetable crop rotation led to the degradation changes of its microbial cenosis such as reduction the number of microorganisms and the diversity of fungi species, repression of cellulose destroying capacity, decrease invertase activity and the rate of humification, intensifying mineralization processes and soil toxicity increasing. Long-term irrigation of ordinary chernozem (Kharkiv Region) with fresh water in moderate regime under 7 -field crop rotation including alfalfa caused no disturbances of microbial cenosis. In this case parameters of biological indices did not deviate from the level of its non-irrigated analogue. Irrigation with saline water causes more profound negative changes of microbial cenosis of chernozem, which not always can be corrected using agroameliorative techniques. Intensive irrigation with saline water with total mineralization from 1. 2 to 2. 2 g/l of ordinary chernozem (Odesa Region) for 13 years has led to a significant degradation changes in the structure and functioning of its microbial cenosis, its radical alteration such as oppression of microflora, {{decrease in the number of}} its main groups by 30 – 40 %, intensification of its mineralization function.
