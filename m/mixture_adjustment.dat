50|$|Pre-ignition {{and engine}} knock both sharply {{increase}} combustion chamber temperatures. Consequently, either effect {{increases the likelihood}} of the other effect occurring, and both can produce similar effects from the operator's perspective, such as rough engine operation or loss of performance due to operational intervention by a powertrain-management computer. For reasons like these, a person not familiarized with the distinction might describe one by the name of the other. Given proper combustion chamber design, pre-ignition can generally be eliminated by proper spark plug selection, proper fuel/air <b>mixture</b> <b>adjustment,</b> and periodic cleaning of the combustion chambers.|$|E

Another method, widely used in aviation, is to measure the exhaust gas temperature, which is close to maximum for an optimally adjusted mixture and drops off steeply when the mixture is either too rich or too lean.|$|E

50|$|The {{carburetion}} on most control-line engines is {{a simple}} fixed-size orifice (venturi) with only a <b>mixture</b> ratio <b>adjustment.</b> The engine can be run over a very wide range of mixtures and adjusting the needle valve {{can be used to}} adjust the engine speed over a small range. Once released, the engine runs at a more-or-less constant speed until the fuel runs out, or, if equipped, the fuel-shutoff is activated. Altering the size of the venturi used can be used to adjust the gross power. Two-stroke glow motors can be made to run in a 4-stroke mode where the engine mis-fires on every other stroke, and changes mode of firing based on load of the propeller. A tremendous degree of control over how the engine runs in flight is possible by altering the fuel contents, propeller size, pitch, and pitch distribution, venturi size, compression ratio of the engine, and the length of the tuned exhaust, if used.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} the pressurization system of the European Service Module (ESM) of the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV). Being part of the propulsion subsystem, an electrical pressurization concept is implemented to condition propellants according to the engine needs via a bang-bang regulation system. Separate pressurization for the oxidizer and the fuel tank permits <b>mixture</b> ratio <b>adjustments</b> and prevents vapor mixing of the two hypergolic propellants during nominal operation. In case of loss of pressurization capability of a single side, the system can be converted into a common pressurization system. The regulation concept is based on evaluation of a set of tank pressure sensors and according activation of regulation valves, based on a single-failure tolerant weighting of three pressure signals. While regulation is performed on ESM level, commanding of regulation parameters as well as failure detection, isolation and recovery is performed from within the Crew Module, developed by Lockheed Martin Space System Company. The overall design and development maturity presented is post Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and reflects the current status of the MPCV ESM pressurization system...|$|R

The performance of two cubic equations of state (EoS) - a translated version of a modified Peng-Robinson and the Jhaveri-Peng-Robinson - in the prediction/correlation of the phase behavior of gas and oil mixtures is presented. Problems associated with the uncertainty involved {{in the description of}} the heavy end of the mixtures are avoided by considering synthetic systems. Prediction results are fair for the gas condensate systems and become very poor when approaching near-critical conditions. The results are better for the oils but deviations are observed with increasing volatility. A systematic evaluation of the improvements obtained by tuning the thermodynamic model to match the saturation pressure alone or together with constant composition expansion data is carried out to determine the number and type of the EoS parameters that need to be tuned. For far-critical gas condensates and for oil <b>mixtures</b> the <b>adjustment</b> of one parameter is adequate to yield satisfactory results. This is not the case for near-critical gas condensates where adjustment of two parameters is necessary. The overall quality of the results obtained by prediction or tuning justifies the wide use of the aforementioned EoS - and probably other cubic EoS - in the petroleum industry. © 1994...|$|R
40|$|Given {{observations}} from a multivariate Gaussian mixture model plus outliers, this paper addresses {{the question of}} how to standardize the mixture to a standard multivariate normal distribution, so that the outliers can be detected using a statistical test. This question is motivated by an image analysis problem in brain oncology of detecting changes between a post-treatment Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan, where background adjustment is necessary to reduce confounding by tissue-dependent changes not related to the disease. When modeling the voxel intensities for the two scans as a bivariate Gaussian <b>mixture,</b> background <b>adjustment</b> translates into standardizing the mixture at each voxel, while tumor lesions present themselves as outliers to be detected. For general multivariate Gaussian mixtures, we show theoretically and numerically that the tail distribution of the standardized scores is favorably close to standard normal in a wide range of scenarios while being conservative at the tails, validating voxelwise hypothesis testing based on standardized scores. To address standardization in spatially heterogeneous data, we propose a spatial and robust multivariate expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, where prior class membership probabilities are provided by transformation of spatial probability template maps and the estimation of the class mean and covariances are robust to outliers. Simulations in both univariate and bivariate cases suggest that standardized scores with soft assignment have tail probabilities that are either very close to or more conservative than standard normal. The proposed methods are applied to a real data set from a PET phantom experiment, yet they are generic and can be used in other contexts...|$|R

This dissertation attempts to explain the role of state elites in policy change in a newly industrializing country. More specifically, it analyzes the adoption of a package of economic policies, collectively known as structural adjustment, in Costa Rica from 1982 to 1990, and the factors that influenced those choices. The study argues that state elites' decisions are influenced, but not determined, by domestic pressure groups or external actors such as multilateral financial institutions (i. e. World Bank). To ascertain the degree of autonomy policy makers have in Costa Rica, I engage in two levels of analysis. The first level centers on the state, in terms of its organizational strength and the degree of consensus among policy elite members. The second focuses on the state-society relations. Three study propositions were empirically supported: (1) the state elite's commitment to structural adjustment was affected by their belief that a severe crisis was affecting the domestic economy and that failure to act would lead to even more threatening economic situation; (2) the implementation of adjustment policies was facilitated by the operating characteristics of the Costa Rican formal institutions which created favorable conditions for cooperation to arise, particularly in a crisis situation; and (3) the political leaders' ability to manage opposition enhanced their degree of autonomy in implementing authoritative decisions. The analysis enabled me to identify two variables overlooked by the existing literature on policy change. First, the representation system is a critical variable in explaining the decision-making context and the <b>mixture</b> of <b>adjustment</b> policies. Second, the analysis suggests that characteristics of the party system have important influence on political leaders' commitment to policy change. Finally, the analysis provides evidence that policy makers have the capacity to act upon broad interests and to bring about changes to pursue these interests. This study thus demonstrates the limitation of society-centered approaches which consider the activities of the state and policy makers as reflections of social class, interest group or rent-seeking objectives. It also demonstrates the limitation of state-centered approaches which argue that policy makers cannot alter the constraint derived from the bureaucratic and political context...|$|R

40|$|Obesity is {{increasingly}} prevalent among older adults, yet {{little is known}} about the distribution of long-term trajectories of body-weight in this age group. The three essays included in this dissertation aim to depict the trajectories of body-mass index (BMI) from middle to old age and to examine social and behavioral variations in these trajectories. Eight waves (1992 - 2006) of the Health and Retirement Study involving a nationally representative cohort of Americans aged 51 to 61 years at baseline were used. Changes in BMI were analyzed using alternatively hierarchical linear modeling or semiparametric <b>mixture</b> modeling, with <b>adjustment</b> for time-constant and time-varying covariates. First study finds that over 14 years, respondents followed a linearly increasing BMI trajectory. Compared with Caucasians, African- Americans had higher BMI levels, while Hispanics had similar BMI levels, but lower rates of increase over time. Higher education predicted lower BMI levels and was not associated with the rate of change. Older age-at-baseline predicted lower BMI levels and lower rates of increase. No gender differences were found. The second study shows that smoking and vigorous physical activity (user status and initiation) were associated with significantly lower BMI trajectories over time. Cessation of smoking and physical activity resulted in higher BMI trajectories over time. The weight-gaining effect of smoking cessation increased during the study period, while the strength of association between BMI trajectories and PA or alcohol use were constant. In the third study, five distinct BMI trajectories are identified, differing primarily in their intercept: normal BMI trajectory (19. 9 % of sample), overweight (43. 8 %), borderline-obese (25. 4 %), obese (8. 9 %), and morbidly-obese (2. 1 %). Each trajectory showed an upward trend over the study period, although the rate-of-increase varied between trajectories. Compared with Whites, Blacks and Hispanics had greater probabilities of membership in the higher BMI trajectory groups. Females had approximately half the risk of following the overweight and obese BMI trajectories compared with males. In conclusion, significant racial/ethnic, gender and educational heterogeneity in BMI trajectories exists in older adults. Health behaviors provide beneficial modifications in BMI trajectories. Tailoring of public health and clinical interventions to trajectory group characteristics may reduce obesity-related health disparities in aging...|$|R

Archaeological Science, 35 (7) 1808 - 1820. Sponsorship: Sir Henry Strakosch Memorial Trust; ARC Discovery Project; NERC GrantOptical ages for 14 sediment samples {{collected from the}} post-Howiesons Poort, late Middle Stone Age (MSA) and final MSA deposits at Sibudu, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa were reported in a companion paper (Jacobs, Z., Wintle, A. G., Duller, G. A. T., Roberts, R. G., Wadley, L. New ages for the post-Howiesons Poort, late and final Middle Stone Age at Sibudu, South Africa. Journal of Archaeological Science, 2008). These ages were based on equivalent dose (D-e) distributions that were overdispersed. In this paper, we investigate factors {{both internal and external}} to the grains that may contribute to such higher than expected overdispersion in single grain D-e values. Intrinsic factors accounted for some, but not all, of the observed scatter, and application of a set of rejection criteria filtered grains for which erroneous D-e values would otherwise be calculated. We investigated sediment mixing and differences in the beta dose received by individual grains in their burial environment as two likely reasons for the observed overdispersion. The scatter in D-e distributions for all the samples is best explained by grains that were deposited {{at the same time and}} which were well bleached, but that subsequently received a range of beta doses. A procedure is presented for adjusting the measured beta dose rate, and its associated error. We show that using a combination of single grain OSL measurements of D-e, the finite <b>mixture</b> model and <b>adjustment</b> of the beta dose rate, result in stratigraphically consistent ages. These ages are more consistent than the ages obtained from multiple grain aliquot D-e values and the average dose rates for each sample; the multiple grain ages are about 10 % older, partly because of the variable dose rate and partly because these aliquots contained grains with undesirable OSL characteristics.
