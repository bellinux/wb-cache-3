2500|$|In September 2007, The Times-Picayune {{reported}} that Vitter and the Bush administration opposed a provision of The Gulf Coast Housing Recovery bill which required that every public housing apartment torn down {{be replaced with}} another form of low-income housing on a one-for-one basis. The administration testified {{that there was not}} sufficient demand for public housing units, a position contested by several senators. Vitter stated it would recreate [...] "housing projects exactly as they were", isolated and riddled with crime. However, Mary Landrieu, the Louisiana Democratic Senator, said the intent was to make certain there were affordable places for working-class people who returned. The bill requires that demolished housing projects be replaced with <b>mixed</b> <b>income</b> communities which local housing advocates say is different from the massive public housing developments that Vitter is referring to. However, the bill does not include a ban on large-scale projects. The city housing authority is planning on replacing 4,000 low-income units with mixed-income projects providing a smaller inventory of low-income units. In December 2007, Vitter prevented the bill from leaving the committee.|$|E

[...] Berube argues that <b>mixed</b> <b>income</b> housing mirrors an organic process in urban America, and that most often “most mixed-income environments do not result from new housing construction, but instead arise organically from migration, income, and household changes at the neighborhood level.” [...] The level of organic economic integration in neighborhoods is contested, however, particularly given significant discrimination against minorities (particularly African Americans) in housing location decisions.

Mixed-income strategies usually begin with the hypothesis that <b>mixing</b> <b>incomes</b> will address a number of problems associated with poverty concentration and neighborhood disinvestment. To set the stage for other articles in the symposium of this issue of Cityscape, this article defines terms and then reviews the hypothesized benefits of mixed-income environments for low-income adults and children and examines evidence of benefits.

To overcome the biases from selection and endogeneity, the parameters of this model are estimated using instrumental variables in a fixed-effect panel analysis employing annual data on 90 438 working-age males in Stockholm over the 1995 – 2006 period. Evidence is found of both neighbourhood effects and neighbourhood selection, but more impor-tantly, it is found that the magnitudes of these effects are substantially altered when taking selection and endogeneity biases into account, compared with when only con-trolling for selection. When taking endogeneity into account, the apparent impact of neighbourhood <b>income</b> <b>mix</b> on individual <b>income</b> is magnified and the effect of indi-vidual income on the percentage of high income in the neighbourhood is magnified. 1...|$|R
