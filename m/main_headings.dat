And as the faint light of his course pierced into the dwellings of men, it fell, as now, on the rosy warmth of nestling children; on the haggard waking of sorrow and sickness; on the hasty uprising of the hard-handed labourer; and on the late sleep of the night-student, who had been questioning the stars or the sages, or his own soul, for that hidden knowledge which would break through the barrier of man's brief life, and show its dark path, that seemed to bend no whither, to be an arc in an immeasurable circle of light and glory. The great river-courses which have shaped the lives of men have hardly changed; and those other streams, the life-currents that ebb and flow in human hearts, pulsate to the same great needs, the same great loves and terrors. As our thought follows close in the slow wake of the dawn, we are impressed with the broad sameness of the human lot, which never alters in the <b>main</b> <b>headings</b> of its history--hunger and labour, seed-time and harvest, love and death.|$|E

40|$|Although it is {{believed}} that exemption to the ruling has been common, coal underground beltways in mine areas developed since 1978 in Queensland are required to have belt heading air segregated from other intake headings to improve the likelihood of maintenance of an uncontaminated escape airway {{in the event of a}} mine fire. Furthermore, the 1996 Moura No 2 Warden’s Inquiry Recommendations set down that underground mines should have one intake airway that is completely segregated from other parallel intake airways so as to provide two separate intake airways means of egress from the mine. The results of a study to examine the implications and costs of these provisions are set down and discussed. A number of Queensland mines are facing conditions of having to mine through extensive seam pockets of high concentration unpleasant and toxic gases such as H 2 S.

40|$|A {{study has}} {{reviewed}} {{the variety of}} mine inertisation systems available in Australia and their technical specifications. Exercises which involved “evaluation or auditing ” of selected mines as {{to the ability to}} deliver inert gases generated from inertisation units to high priority underground fire locations have been undertaken in a number of mines. These exercises have been built around the use of the fire simulation computer program VENTGRAPH and modelling of fire scenarios in selected different mine layouts. A coding system has been developed from these audit exercises. Designs have been developed to allow delivery of high volumes of inert gases down mine bore holes. A section of the paper has examined considerations presented by the layouts of underground mines developed from surface extraction pits. Inertisation and dilution issues in mine openings create complex situations. <b>Mains</b> <b>headings</b> present a complex ventilation network with often numerous parallel headings, hundreds of cut-throughs and a variety of ventilation control devices. In these complex systems the additional interference from a fire means maintaining control of the movement of inert gas is more difficult than elsewhere in the mine.

New approaches allowing improvement in understanding their use of inertisation techniques have been examined. The outcome of the project is that the mining industry is in an improved position in their understanding of mine fires, use of inertisation and the use of modern advances to preplan for the handling of possible emergency incidents...|$|R

40|$|In early 2009 the Contributing Factors Framework (CFF) was {{launched}} nationally {{to the rail}} industry in Australia. It was developed specifically for the rail industry and aligns with systemic incident investigation models. It was developed to capture and code information about all factors that {{may have contributed to}} a rail safety occurrence. The three <b>main</b> coding <b>headings</b> used in the CFF to capture this information are: Individual/Team Actions, Technical Failures and Local Conditions/Organisational Factors. Whilst the CFF currently captures contributing factors in the three stand alone headings this research is interested in visually modelling the previously unseen and unidentified non-linear network interactions of all the contributing factors across these three headings. It is also interested in looking at the strength of the relationships amongst the factors as a more holistic way of understanding accident taxonomy. The aim is to identify the trends, through modelling, of which factors contribute the most to high risk types of rail safety accidents and incidents. To achieve this aim major rail safety occurrence reports were analysed for the 5 year period 2006 to 2010 using the CFF tool. The contributing factors for four high risk types of rail incidents: being Collisions, Derailments, Safe Working Breaches and Signals Passes at Dangers (SPADs) will be modelled. Work has now begun on using network analysis software to investigate how the contributing factors are interlinked, how contributing factors are networking and the contribution that the factors have on accident phenomenology. It is envisaged that the outcome of this project will be {{the development of a new}} form of visual accident modelling and that this modelling will identify which contributing factors need to be controlled or mitigated for each type of rail safety incident to enhance accident prevention...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the eight issues of Stéphane Mallarmé's 1874 fashion magazine, La Dernière Mode, focussing on ideas of process. On the one hand, it views La Dernière Mode {{as a vital}} phase {{in the evolution of}} Mallarmé’s aesthetic and, on the other, it sees the discourse of fashion itself as being in a continual state of trial and re-definition. The thesis begins with a citation from Mallarmé's 1886 article, 'Mimique'; this passage showcases the complex relationship between the interpenetrating themes of Time, Drama and Fiction, which form the three <b>main</b> chapter <b>headings.</b> Taking a thematic and linguistic approach, the thesis will explore literary, theoretical and philosophical mechanisms in La Dernière Mode, assessing ways in which these can be seen to have evolved from ideas established in Mallarmé's early verse and prose writing, and tracing their evolution {{over the course of the}} poet's later works. This study will also acknowledge the importance of crisis, both personal and social, and its influence on Mallarmé’s aesthetic, showing La Dernière Mode to be part of a dynamic process by which the parameters of literature are tested and re-defined. My study aims to contribute to the development of recent scholarship of Mallarmé, which acknowledges and celebrates his engagement with the material world and his interest in the aesthetic value of the practices of everyday life. Challenging views of Mallarmé as the 'ivory-tower poet' and destabilizing distinctions between his poetic and 'alimentary' works, this thesis thus makes a case for seeing La Dernière Mode as a testing ground for fundamental aspects of the poet's aesthetic with significant implications for the direction his æuvre would take in the 1880 s and 1890 s. The fashion magazine can thus, I contend, be considered as having a dynamic relationship with the poet's unattainable ideal of the 'Livre'. This thesis is not currently available via ORA...|$|R

This dissertation looks at the trends and characteristics of students embarking upon a career in the library and information profession. It also considers the impression and the ethos generated by the way Career Information and Course Handbooks present library and information services. In particular, it profiles the LUT DILS student intakes for the Academic Year 91 / 92. Students' previous job experience and their chosen careers were analysed against their given reasons to embark upon a library and information course so as to establish whether a library and information profession is their first or their second choice of career. It was found that the intakes are predominantly female and they are inclined to specialise in humanities and social science subjects. They are likely to be individuals who are inquisitive, investigative, like attending to details and have good interpersonal skills not in organising and administering people but in understanding and helping people. He or she is also likely to be an independent worker who values the aesthetic qualities of the work and the workplace. They {{are not likely to be}} outwardly competitive. Most of them do not care for monetary gain and they seemingly lack leadership qualities. Most of them consider the role of work important and they are keen to identify their implicit need for personal growth with their job. The results suggest that the library and information profession embarked upon was treated by some as a second choice of career. The main first chosen careers are in the literary proper, social work and in teaching. Course reference handbooks for different educational establishments could not agree in their <b>main</b> entry <b>headings</b> for library and information work and they tend to have different philosophical outlooks for the library and information profession.

40|$|Business {{incubation}} is {{a business}} support process that accelerates the successful development of start-up and fledgling companies by providing entrepreneurs {{with an array of}} targeted resources and services. These services are usually developed or orchestrated by incubator management and offered both in the business incubator and through its network of contacts. A business incubator’s main goal is to produce successful firms that will leave the program financially viable and freestanding. These incubator graduates have the potential to create jobs, revitalize neighborhoods, commercialize new technologies, and strengthen local and national economies’. (NBIA 2010) All incubator representative organisations have different standards that they believe, business incubators should reach, in order to become models of best practice. However, at the moment, there are no internationally recognisable and comparable benchmarks. The information on innovation and incubation is vast and varied. This study found that there was little specific information on internationally recognisable benchmark criteria used in incubation centres (chapter 2). The study undertaken was a qualitative data based study, based on publicly available information (chapter 3). There was limited information available from individual incubation centres. The study specifically avoided critiquing the activities and operations of the IiBC at GMIT, to avoid any harmful or incorrect assumptions being made. The scope of the study did not allow for the benchmarking of different centres, but an investigation of some of the components of best practice in operation in different global centres, and recommend their possible application to the Innovation in Business Centre at Galway Mayo Institute of Technology. The findings of the study were that best practice could be generalised into eight <b>main</b> benchmark <b>headings</b> (chapter 4 and 5). The study went on to highlight examples of best practice in these areas that may be of particular interest to the IiBC- some of which could be implemented immediately and others with the cooperation of other centres. The study concludes (chapter 6) that without incubators coming together to agree benchmark criteria, they are losing out on potential synergies. Most of the recommendations would be easier to implement with the co-operation of other centres, locally, nationally and internationally. Networking alone, with other incubators, could offer benefits on benchmarking, marketing and resource utilisation. The report also puts forward numerous recommendations for implementation at the IiBC. In the absence better networking, and thus better benchmarking, the achievement of corporate goals is the most powerful benchmarking tool that is currently available at the IiBC. Corporate governance, and the importance that the GMIT, and the IiBC at GMIT places on governance, should assist greatly in this process and should insure that the IiBC always strives to become a model of best practice- no matter what benchmark criteria this is being compared against...|$|R
40|$|With the {{exponential}} {{growth of the}} World Wide Web, automated subject classification of Web pages {{has become a major}} research issue in information and computer sciences. Organizing Web pages into a hierarchical structure for subject browsing is gaining more recognition as an important tool in information-seeking processes. In this thesis, different automated classification approaches, focusing on organizing textual Web pages into a browsable hierarchical structure, were critically examined and compared. Three major approaches to automated subject classification have been recognized, each coming from a different research community: machine learning, information retrieval and library science. While these approaches have common research aims and a number of methods and techniques, and as such could benefit from each other, {{it has been shown that}} authors belonging to the three communities do not communicate with authors from the other two communities to a large extent. The two biggest differences between the approaches are whether they employ a vector space model (machine learning and information retrieval), and whether they make use of controlled vocabularies such as, for example, classification schemes, thesauri, or ontologies (library science). Certain special characteristics of Web pages (e. g. metadata and structural elements such as title, <b>headings,</b> <b>main</b> text) were investigated as to how they could be best used in automated classification. The study indicated that all the structural information and metadata available in Web pages should be used in order to achieve the best automated classification results; however, the exact way of combining them proved not to be very important. It has been claimed that well-structured, high-quality controlled vocabularies, could serve as good browsing structures. The degree and nature of subject browsing conducted by users of a large Web-based service (Renardus) was studied, using log analysis. The study showed that browsing is used to a much larger degree than searching, indicating the usefulness of browsing in such services and possibly implying the suitability of such a controlled vocabulary (Dewey Decimal Classification) for browsing...|$|R
40|$|Are South African Buildings as Safe as New Zealand Buildings?” A person {{going into}} or using a {{building}} {{anywhere in the}} world has certain expectations as to the perceived and acceptable level of risk to life safety. There are also societal expectations and acceptability levels which are perhaps not explicitly stated. Building legislation in both New Zealand and South Africa appear to have similar goals, yet when applying the relative prescriptive document to a similar building in each country the perception is that one country has a higher level of safety over the other. Having worked {{for a number of years}} under both sets of building design regimes, the author was of the opinion that aspects of one prescriptive document has more stringent requirements than the other and that buildings in the one country thus had a higher apparent level of life safety than the other. The question was asked: How much difference is there in (fire) life safety for an occupant of a building in New Zealand compared to a building in South Africa? Is a similar building designed to a higher standard in one country as opposed to the other? To test the author‟s hypothesis in a measured way a scoring system was required to quantify the relative level of safety. The comparison is carried out using the Fire Safety Index scoring system developed by McGhie. A spreadsheet analysis is carried out for similar building types (Building Use, Height, Fire Load and Number of Occupants) complying with each country‟s relevant acceptable solution or deemed-to-satisfy document using McGhie‟s weighted risk ranking model. Buildings are assessed across four Building Use Parameters (Purpose Group, Escape Height, Occupant Numbers and Fire Hazard Category). As the buildings assessed are very similar, the Building Use Scores are virtually identical; with some variations, for example, when occupant numbers are capped because of limitations on fire cell floor areas. The Fire Safety Features Score for each building is then assessed for the minimum requirements of the prescriptive documents across eight <b>main</b> category <b>headings</b> (Fire Barriers, Fire Alarm, Smoke Control, Building Fire Control, Emergency Power Supply, Communication System, Fire Service and Means of Escape) and a number of sub-categories. Once the attribute score is assigned and the ii weighting applied the total score is summed and a numerical rating score is achieved for each building out of a possible maximum score of 5. As approximately 63 % of commercial buildings (in NZ) are single storey and a further 28 % are two-storey‟s high, the discussion of the differences in score between the two sets of buildings will primarily focus on one and two storey buildings, and the scoring is weighted to account for the relative building stock, with averaging used for the various occupant loads. The results show that for equivalent Working Purpose groups (WL), Mercantile Occupancies (CM) and Residential Occupancies (SR) the South African buildings are safer than the New Zealand buildings. Occupancies which are Crowd Activities (CL) and Sleeping Accommodation (SA) are safer in New Zealand than in South Africa. The Working Moderate fire load (WM) occupancy is rated equal for both countries...|$|R
