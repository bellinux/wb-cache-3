40|$|Lake Vrana is {{a natural}} {{oligotrophic}} lake situated {{on the island of}} Cres (northeastern Adriatic Sea). Its <b>macrophytic</b> flora and <b>vegetation</b> were studied in 2010, nearly 50 years after the first comprehensive research on it. Vegetation of vascular plants, including belts of helophytes and submersed vegetation, dominates in the shallowest water. Charophytic vegetation starts to develop at the depth of approximately 8 m and is present in three clear zones dominated by Chara aculeolata, Ch. virgata and Nitella opaca, reaching a final depth of 30 m. The lake and its vegetation belong to habitat type 3140 (hard oligo-mesotrophic waters with benthic vegetation of Chara species), protected by the Habitat Directive. Due to the presence of several charophyte species endangered in the Balkans and Europe, the lake is an important site for the conservation of charophytes at the national and European levels. Great changes in the water regime over the last decades due to increase of water temperature and overexploitation of the lake’s water are exerting a strong negative effect on this protected special reserve. A future comprehensive monitoring program, including climatological observation and surveillance of introduced alien fish populations, should focus on determining the cause of the observed retreat of vegetation in the lake...|$|R
40|$|This study {{determined}} {{the nature and}} extent of trace elements, metals, and petroleum hydrocarbons in evaporation ponds used for the disposal of process water from Sinclair Oil Corporation’s LARCO oil refinery in Evansville, Wyoming. This study was conducted to determine if contaminants are causing adverse effects or have the potential to adversely affect aquatic migratory birds inhabiting the evaporation ponds. The discharge of refinery process water into relict dune basins created a series of ponds that provide habitat for 39 species of aquatic migratory birds. Several aquatic bird species nest at the evaporation ponds and the adjacent natural marsh complex. Migrating waterfowl and shorebirds also use the ponds as a stop-over with peak numbers (between 1, 000 and 2, 000 birds) occurring in mid-September during the fall migration. The refinery evaporation ponds are highly eutrophic and contain elevated concentrations of arsenic, chromium, copper, mercury, nickel, lead, selenium, and zinc in bottom sediments. Sediments from the nearby Russian Olive Pond contained elevated concentrations of arsenic, chromium, mercury and nickel. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were also present in high concentrations in sediments from the three evaporation ponds. Although these trace elements and PAHs are elevated in the bottom sediments, eutrophication is likely limiting the availability of these contaminants to the food chain and aquatic migratory birds. Some trace elements such as selenium are accumulating in the food chain and PAHs are present in algae and aquatic invertebrates. Selenium bioaccumulation was documented in aquatic birds nesting at the ponds. Selenium concentrations in black-necked stilt eggs (mean = 13. 6 μg/g) exceeded the 6 to 7 μg/g threshold associated with impaired egg hatchability in black-necked stilts. Selenium concentrations in livers from prefledged juvenile American avocets (mean = 13. 8 μg/g) and blue-winged teal (mean = 20. 1 μg/g) exceeded background for avian livers of 10 μg/g level. Other species of waterfowl, such as widgeon, gadwall, and Northern shoveler, feeding on algae and aquatic invertebrates in the evaporation ponds are probably also bioaccumulating selenium at levels of concern. PAH bile metabolites and analysis of the liver detoxification enzyme ethoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase (EROD) shows that aquatic birds feeding in the evaporation ponds are exposed to petroleum hydrocarbons; however, it is not known if this exposure is resulting in adverse effects. The eutrophic nature of these ponds is precluding the establishment of <b>macrophytic</b> aquatic <b>vegetation</b> as well as limiting the density and diversity of aquatic invertebrates, both dietary items consumed by aquatic migratory birds. Eutrophication and its contribution of organic matter onto the surficial sediments is likely limiting the bioavailability of trace elements and petroleum hydrocarbons as these contaminants are strongly bound to the organic matter within the sediment. Although eutrophication is limiting the availability of chemical contaminants in the food chain, the potential exists for the presence of cyanotoxins produced by cyanobacteria in the evaporation ponds...|$|R

Communities dominated by each of 16 of these taxa occur in 10 or more wetlands and vary in mean richness from 4 to 18 species, richness increasing towards the margins of wetlands, with the area of wetland, and with decreasing salinity. A combination of salinity and permanence indices explains over one-third of the floristic variation between these communities; within freshwater wetlands, pH has more influence than the permanence index.

The specific question was to see if slight increases in the water regime of the lake (three scenarios), {{as part of a}} restoration programme, affect the timing of nesting and occupation of colonies by whiskered terns by way of changes in biomass of waterlily (Nymphaea alba) beds where colonies always establish. During the study period, egg-laying dates were progressively delayed up to 40 – 50 days (mid-May to early July) in relation to late appearance of suitable waterlily biomass (R 2 = 0. 67, p = 0. 01) associated with high spring water levels (1. 10 – 1. 25 m vs. 0. 95 m). Simultaneously some nesting attempts were observed in sub-optimal habitats (adjacent wet grasslands) in high flooding conditions leading either to poor breeding success or colony desertion. We concluded {{that there is a need}} for compromise between the experimental water levels used to control waterlily biomass and the nesting requirements of the whiskered tern population in this lake of international importance (260 – 510 pairs in 1995 – 2002, ‡ 1 % Ramsar level) ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to conduct a site {{inventory}} survey of littoral vegetation and propose management measures to protect <b>macrophytic</b> <b>vegetation.</b> For this reason, a list of species of riparian vegetation found on the site has been made. According the processed pictures of macrophytic species we defined communities occurring in the area of interest which were drawn into the maps. The occurrence of the endangered and exotic species has been also monitored. The monitoring was carried out on the territory of the ponds ofthe local organization of the Czech Fishing Union Duchcov. This site is located in Podkrušnohorská basin, which is struggling with the environmental load resulting from the brown coal mining. The results were compared with similar work from other locations. The reason was to assess biodiversity in the area of the interest. The created maps of littoral communities have been confronted with the maps of habitat processed by The Agency for Nature Conservation and Landscape protection.

40|$|Minimal {{sampling}} {{areas have}} been determined for marine Bangiophyceae and Cyanophyceaee epiphytic on Cladophora prolifera and Halopteris scoparia in Calvi, Corsica. This was done by observing the stabilization of species/area curves and of qualitative and quantitative similarity coefficients between samples of increasing size. For Cyanophyceae (studied only on Cladophora) the minimal sampling area is {{in the order of}} 15 - 38 mm 2, depending on the method used. The sampling area is smaller when the quantitative similarity coefficient is used, apparently because of the rather homogeneous distribution of a few abundant taxa. For the same reason the quantitative similarity coefficient stabilizes at a high value (75 %). For Bangiophyceae on Cladophora, the area is of the order of 7 - 10 mm 2, but a larger area is necessary for the quantitative than for the qualitative coefficient. The stabilized value of the quantitative coefficient is relatively low (66 %), {{despite the fact that the}} qualitative coefficient reaches 94 %. On Halopteris, by counting only on medium sized ramifications (about 100 um in diameter), one can use a sampling area as low as 0. 1 - 0. 5 mm 2 and obtain a qualitative similarity coefficient of 100 % and a quantitative one of 80 %.

40|$|The aquatic {{vegetation}} in 44 similar {{shallow and}} sheltered inlets exposed to {{different kinds of}} disturbances by boating was studied in a rocky archipelago in the Baltic Sea. The results indicate that both recreational boating activities and traffic by medium sized ferryboats may cause significant changes in community composition and have significant negative effects on species richness {{and the development of}} the <b>macrophytic</b> <b>vegetation</b> at greater depth. Changes in inlet morphology by dredging and increases in resuspension and turbidity by wave-action from boats were most probably the major factors contributing to the demonstrated differences in the vegetation between inlets. In inlets used as harbours for private boats (marinas) or adjacent to ferryboat routes, vegetation cover and species richness declined significantly more with depth than in reference inlets not exposed to disturbance by boating activities. In marinas, turbidity was significantly higher than in reference inlets. Accordingly, a canonical correspondence analysis showed that the abundance of species sensitive to poor light conditions, such as Chara spp. and Ruppia spp. were negatively correlated with marinas while Myriophyllum spicatum and Ceratophyllum demersum that are common in nutrient rich turbid habitats were positively correlated with marinas. Mechanical disturbance by propellers may also have contributed to the results, disfavouring Potamogeton pectinatus compared to similar caulescent species in marinas. Chara tomentosa and Najas marina that are exposure sensitive mud thriving species were negatively correlated with inlets adjacent to ferryboat routes, while the macroalga, Fucus vesiculosus that is dependent on clean substrate for successful recruitment was positively correlated with inlets adjacent to ferryboat routes. It is important to explore further the effects of boating activities in these habitat types, since the studied inlets sustain a high diversity of both plants and invertebrates and provide highly significant recruitment areas for coastal fish in the Baltic Sea.

40|$|Aquatic macrophytes are the {{flowering}} plants and larger algae growing submerged in or emerging from water. Macrophytes are {{an essential component}} of riverine ecosystems: they produce oxygen, filter out sediments and pollutants and provide habitat and food sources for invertebrates, fish and mammals. The Macquarie and South Esk Rivers in Tasmania are the largest rivers of the northern central plain, and are unique in Tasmania in having long stretches of relatively stable and abundant <b>macrophytic</b> <b>vegetation</b> along their mid- to lower reaches. The macrophyte communities of the mid- to lower reaches of the two rivers are described by classification into groups with similar species composition. Significant environmental variation between groups is determined. Depth, substrate type and distance upstream are the environmental factors most strongly associated with variation between the distribution of individual species/species assemblages. Distance upstream, percentage shading, river form, stream width, substrate type and bank height are the factors most strongly associated with variation between groups of sites. Bank vegetation type, distance upstream, percentage shading, level of stock damage and stream width are found to be the environmental factors most strongly associated with differences in richness and diversity. Percentage shading and bank vegetation type are the factors most strongly associated with differences in cover. The two rivers are found to differ significantly in percentage cover and total species richness. The associated environmental factors that vary significantly between the rivers are percentage shading, bank height, bank vegetation type, level of stock damage and stream width. The species rich and abundant macrophyte communities in the mid-reaches of the Macquarie River and {{in some parts of the}} South Esk are found to have high conservation value. A vulnerable marginal species, Persicaria decipiens, is also of high conservation value. Willow infestation and changes to flow regimes or water quality are seen as being the greatest threats to these communities. The importance of management of stock access to river edges and the potential value of buffer zones are discussed...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: This is a {{preliminary}} {{account of the}} wetlands near Lakes Manapouri and Te Anau, New Zealand. It discusses briefly the vegetational history of the area and describes the general nature and vegetation of certain of the mires. TERl We wi!) h to avoid using terms which might be considered colloquial and imprecise or which have been given precise and fairly limiting definitions e]sewhere. Therefore, throughout this paper, the terms 'wetland ' and more especiaHy 'mire' are emp]oyed. "Vetland ' is a general term for an ecosystem which has a water-table above, at, or just below the substrate surlace so that the substrate is water-saturated {{for most of the}} year. ']'Iire ' is 'also a broad term and is used when referring to specific wetland sites carrying any type of <b>macrophytic</b> <b>vegetation.</b> It has had widespread use elsewhere, particularly by Scandinavian workers (e. g. Sjors 1950). fires are defined as areas where excessive is the major influence on plant growth. For a variety of reasons most species which occur in mires cannot survive in well drained or periodically dry sites. Godwin and Conway (1939, p. 313) restrict the term as "embracing all kinds of peat]ands and all kinds of peat land vegetation", but we prefer to extend it to encompass vegetated wetland sites where little or no peat accumulation has occurred. Terms such as 'bog', 'fen', 'swamp ' etc. are avoided since there is insufficient information to permit dear definition of New Zealand types. 'Deposit ' is a general term used to refer to material which has accumulated on a wetland site. 'Sediment ' refers to any material, organic or inorganic, which has accumulated allochthonously or autochthonously. Autochthonous deposits are sometimes differentiated from sediments proper but it is often difficult, in considering the stratigraphy of deposits of a mire, to distinguish between those elements,vhich have been derived in situ and those which have been derived elsewher...|$|E
40|$|Investigations on the {{biodiversity}} {{in relation to}} conservative and non-conservative parameters in the Mangalavanam mangrove ecosystem, located in the northern fringes of Cochin City {{have been carried out}} from January to June 2002. The mangrove ecosystem is regularly under tidal influence and hence submergence and emergence of land takes place depending on the tidal amplitude. The average dissolved oxygen of the water was found to be 3. 5 ml/l despite the fact, phytoplankton was abundant in the ecosystem. It reveals that respiratory demand of the aquatic biota has exceeded the photosynthetic oxygen production. The indirect relationship exhibited by the quantity of phytoplankton and oxygen is attributed to anthropogenic activities, which resulted in to the eutrophication of the mangrove ecosystem. The general nutrient load was at a higher level. The <b>macrophytic</b> <b>vegetation</b> was dominated by A^icennia marina, Rhizdphora mucronata and Acanthus ilicifolius. The presence of Avicennia and Acanthus in majority of the area that showed decrease in salinity and more freshwater influx. The phytoplankton community was dominated by djatoms represented Naviculaceae followed by Coscinodisceae, which Is evidenced by the presence of high quantity of silicate. The Zooplankton was dominated by copepods. Benthic community is dominated by the infauna such as polychaetes and decapods. Juveniles of common brackish water fishes. Chanos spp., Liza spp., Etroplus spp., Silago spp., Lethrinus spp. and Lutjanus spp., and species of crustaceans like Penaeus spp., Metapenaeus spp., Macrobrachium spp., Acetes spp., Metaplex spp., Sesarma spp., Uca spp., and Scylla spp., {{have been found to be}} the residents of the mangrove ecosystem.

40|$|A {{detailed}} account is given of the <b>macrophytic</b> <b>vegetation</b> {{of the major}} rivers within the Tweed Basin. Of these rivers, the Tweed and its largest tributary, the Teviot, tare been studied in most detail, both being surveyed from source to mouth. Information brought together on the history and physiography of the Tweed Basin are summarized in this account, together with physical and water chemical data collected during the survey. The distribution of species is discussed in relation to changes in such parameters. The method of survey involved recording {{the presence or absence}} of all macrophytic species within 0. 5 km lengths of river, together with a subjective evaluation of their abundance. 570 such 0. 5 km lengths were surveyed. All macroscopically visable species were recorded which were found completely submerged or at the immediate edge of the river. A total of 180 different macrophytic growths (usually species, but occasionally identified only to genus level) were present in the basin, including: 31 algae, 5 lichens, 83 bryophytes, 59 angiosperms, 2 macroscopic microbial communities. The identification and taxonomy of all species were studied critically. Environmental parameters collected in most detail were the physical characteristics of each river, such as altitude, features of the substratum and flow regime. A water sampling programme was undertaken which involved the collection of 5 duplicate samples from sites in the main river and tributaries, and subsequent analysis for optical density, pH, conductivity, 10 cations and 6 anions. The final discussion includes an appraisal of literature concerned with macrophytes in rivers, methods of study, and results obtained. Particular attention is paid to floristic accounts, especially those from the neighbourhood of the Tweed, the floras of these rivers being compared with the flora of the Tweed Basin. Comparison with data from these surveys would suggest that the Tweed is a river which is especially rich in macrophyte species. The presence of historical data and herbarium specimens collected over the past two centuries has made it possible to suggest tentatively that the distribution of some species has changed markedly, whereas others appear to have changed little over 150 years. Cladophora, glomerata is an example of a species which in recent years has become much less abundant. This is most probably due to a decrease in total phosphate content ±n. the water, this in turn being due to a reduction in the use of synthetic detergents by the textile industry...|$|E

Von der Gesamtzahl der Arten (121) waren 50 Arten Vertreter der Chlorophyta und 39 Arten Vertreter der Bacillariophyceeae, während quantitativ Cyanophyta (415 — 1077 Zell/cm 3) dominierten. Das bearbeitete Phytoplankton war charaktermässig limnophil und potamophil und hatte sich unter dem Einfluss veränderlicher hydrologischer Verhältnisssen, negativer anthropogener Einwirkungen sowie der Konkurrenz in Bezug auf die Ernährung anwesender höheren Wasserpflanzen entwickelt.

40|$|La végétation macrophytique des rivières acides d'Europe occidentale présente une grande unité, marquée par la constance d'un {{ensemble}} floristique de base, dont certaines espèces (Callitriche hamulata, Myriophyllum alterniflorum, Potamogeton polygonifolius, P. alpinus, etc) sont propres à ces eaux acides, d'autres (Callitriche platycarpa, Sparganium emersum, Elodea canadensis, Potamogeton crispus, etc) étant communes avec les eaux calcaires. Cet ensemble subit des variations écologiques et chorologiques :L'augmentation du niveau trophique des eaux conduit d'une végétation oligotrophe (différenciée par P. polygonifolius, Juncus bulbosus, etc) à un groupement mésoeutrophe (caractérisé par Callitriche obtusangula, Nasturtium officinale, etc). Ainsi, quatre types de phytocénoses ont pu étre distingués dans les Vosges du Nord {{en fonction}} de ce paramètre. D'autre part, une pollution organique localisée, par exemple par une pisciculture en Bretagne, provoque une augmentation des espèces eutrophes (C. obtusangula) et une régression des taxons plus oligotrophes (Scapania undulata). L'alternance de biotopes courants et lents se traduit par un remplacement de phytocénoses : ainsi, en Bretagne, Oenanthe crocata et Ranunculus penicillafus sont associées sur les radiers, alors que Nuphar lutea et S. emersum caractérisent les mouilles. De plus, une diminution de l'éclairement permet la présence de groupements bryophytiques spécifiques. Les principales variations chorologiques {{entre les deux}} territoires correspondent à un enrichissement des zones atlantiques en macrophytes euatlantiques ou méditerranéoatiantiques, comme O. crocata ou Apium inundatum, qui manquent dans les régions médioeuropéennes. En outre, selon les territoires biogéographiques, l'écologie de certaines espèces peut varier (par exempte S. emersum, R. peltatus, P. polygonifolius). Les macrophytes permettent donc, à l'instar des invertébrés benthiques, l'élaboration de biodiagnostics des eaux courantes. For {{the study of the}} vegetation of acid rivers in France, two areas have been investigated by the authors : Armorican Massif and Northern Vosges (fig. 1). This paper has two aims :- assessing the general trends of macrophytic vegetation : floristic composition and plant communities, with special reference to the influence of physical and water quality parameters,- pointing out and interpreting the variations observed between the two regions (chorological differences), and in the watercourses (ecological variations). Floristic data and phytosociological surveys (from bryophytes to angiosperm macrophytes) were collected along 50 m. stretches (at least) by the stratified sampling method in the case of large watercourses, and by systematic surveys for smaller ones. Consecutive 50 m. long sketches were used to measure the effect of localized pollution. (The inventory is as precise as possible). A distinction was made between the aquatic communities and river-bankside ones. At the same time, physical parameters were measured or observed (depth, light conditions, width, [...] .), certain water-quality parameters were measured (pH, conductivity, [...] .) and water samples were collected for further analysis. The data collected are gathered and compared in a table (table 1) showing differences between aquatic and subaquatic species, and between sunlit and shaded stretches. Trophic tendencies of most species are given according to either our observations or the literature. The main ecological feature is the streaking longitudinal variation of aquatic species, which agrees with the zones described by ILLIES and BOTOSANEANU : crenon, rhitron and potamon. In sunlit areas the succession is dominated by the following species :Potamogeton polygonifolius, Juncus bulbosus, Glyceria fluitans, [...] . -> Ranunculus spp., Callitriche hamulata, Myriophyllum alterniflorum, [...] .      ->Potamogeton crispus, Elodea canadensis, [...] . Areas in the shade are characterized by bryophyta; the succession is : Scapania ondulata->Rhynchostegim riparioïdes, Fontinalis antipyreticaAs for the aquatic species, a longitudinal succession of bankside species exists :Sparganium erectum, Carex paniculata, Carex rostrata->Phalaris arundinacea      ->Phalaris arundinacea, Typha latifoliaThe <b>macrophytic</b> <b>vegetation</b> in acid rivers of Western Europe shows a great homogeneity, marked by the constancy of a floristic list, in which some species (Callitriche hamulata, Myriophyllum alterniflorum, Potamogeton polygonifolius, Potamogeton alpinus, Scapania undulata, etc.) only grow into acid waters, while others species (Callitriche platycarpa, Sparganium emersum, Elodea canadensis, Potamogeton crispus, etc.) grow also in calcareous waters. This basic unit is submitted to ecological and chorological variations. Ecological variations are due mainly to changes of the water quality. They are illustrated by two examples :- two river systems in the Northern Vosges where a general survey shows longitudinal variations of communities without pollution or assessing different kinds of pollution,- a pisciculture pollution with observations of species distribution on consecutive sketches. An increase of water trophic level leads progressively from an oligotrophic vegetation (marked by Potamogeton polygonifolius, Juncus bulbosus, etc.) to a meso-eutrophic community (characterized by Callitfriche obtusangula, Nasturtium officinale, etc.). Four communities are distinguished in Northern Vosges (table 2) and characterize water quality (both pollution and trophic level)  :A : Potamogeton polygonifolius, Juncus bulbosus, Sphagnum spp. community, with the following main water-quality parameters : conductivity : 40 - 80 µS, phosphates : 500 ppb N). Two vegetation maps show the distribution of these communities (fig. 2). The succession of communities is related to water quality and fastened sequences are compared to normal ones. Without any pollution, A and B communities caver more than 5 km along the upper streams; under these conditions, the entire sequence A to D develops to 15 km, while with much anthropic pollution, it may occur within less than 3 km. A heavy pollution leads to the leads of communities as observed with the change tram A to C (without any B) due to a camping-site. A localized organic pollution by a Breton pisciculture is responsible for water-quality changes (table 3) : ammonia, nitrites, phosphates and conductivity increase. The succession of mineral nitrogen forms is assessed (fig. 3). In the N-NH 4 + and N-NO 2 - peak areas, the eutrophic species increase (Callitriche spp., specially Callitriche obtusangula, Amblystegium riparium) and the oligotrophic ones decrease (Scapania undulata) (fig. 3). Tissue analysis of Ranunculus penicillatus and of Callitriche spp. does not show any enrichment in nitrogen in polluted areas: the ecological response is mainly an increase of nitrophilous macrophytes (Callitriche spp.). The influence of water quality is more obvious in the Northern Vosges for most of the oligotrophic communities grow in forested sketches, white in Brittany these conditions are rare and eutrophication occurs in all the streams, even in the source areas. Floristically, neutrophilous or ubiquitous species are numerous. Some of them indicate either eutrophication or pollution : Amblystegium riparium and perhaps Octodiceras fontanum for bryophyta, Callitriche obtusangula, Potamageton perfoliatus and Sparganium. emersum (long leaves form), for aquatic species, Nasturtium officinale, Glyceria maxima for helophytes. Physical parameters also lead to variations. The succession of swift and slow areas leads to changes in the communities. Thus, in Brittany, Oenanthe crocata and Ranunculus penicillatus are associated on the riffles, while Nuphar lutes and Sparganium emersum characterize the pools, even in the upper parts of the streams where there are watermill ponds. The relationships between local hydrodynamic features and species distribution are discussed with regards to the stretches around the pisciculture area. Main chorological variation is an enrichment of atlantic areas with numerous eu-atlantic or mediterraneo-atlantic species : Porella pinnata and Amblystegium fluviatile as bryophyla, Oenanthe crocata, Apium inundatum, Ranunculus omiophyllus as spermaphyta. As there are few or no species restricted to medio-european areas, Atlantic communities are often richer than eastern ones. But some invading species as Elodea nuttallii are spreading all over the country from North-Eastern France. Ecological trends of certain species (Sparganium emersum, Ranunculus peltatus, Potamogeton polygonifolius) can change between the two biogeographical areas. So, Sparganium emersum grows in the upper oligotrophic zones in Northern Vosges while it characterizes lower meso-eutrophic zones in Brittany. In Brittany, Ranunculus peltatus un exist in eutrophic areas when the stretches are far from the sea. Potamogeton polygonifolius is very rare in swift streams in Brittany. Therefore, macrophytes permit, as benthic invertebrates do, to get a river biodiagnosis. They are easily observed and mapped so they can be used for a general survey...|$|E
