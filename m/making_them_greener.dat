50|$|C4mim is a {{shorthand}} for 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium salts. These are ionic liquids based on imidazole chemistry. A common {{example of such}} is C4mimCl, or 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride. These salts are currently of interest in industry due {{to their ability to}} be infinitely recycled and their amenability to solvation at room temperature, <b>making</b> <b>them</b> excellent <b>green</b> solvents. C4mim is based on the parent compound 1-butyl-3-methylimidazole with one electron removed from the imidazole arene group. The stability of this cation {{lies in the fact that}} the resulting electronic vacancy is delocalised across the arene group, albeit unequally so.|$|R
30|$|For Millennials (Gen Y) the {{education}} on {{environmental protection and}} social responsibility (0.343 **) has a significant influence in <b>making</b> <b>them</b> choose <b>green</b> DIY stores, with an impact of high relationship strength and significance. Millennials also purchased from these stores because {{they were willing to}} make a financial sacrifice to protect the environment (0.162 *), and because the DIY stores implemented social responsibility measures (0.194 **). Education on environmental protection and social responsibility prompted them to take action, while their <b>green</b> orientation made <b>them</b> believe that, through their competencies, they had a share in protecting nature and reducing the consumption of resources (Table 4).|$|R
30|$|According to {{population}} size, Millennials represent a target segment consisting of over 80 million people (Taken Smith, 2014). Companies often conduct specific research {{to better understand}} Millennials’ characteristics, values, preferences, motives, attitudes and behaviour, hoping to identify appropriate levers to draw their attention, provide them with information and have them buy their products (Hill Hyun-Hwa Lee, 2012). Millennials have a preference for social responsible products and brands which {{have a positive impact}} on the environment, the production of which does not have harmful effects or a negative influence on nature (Chu et al., 2013). Being aware of the potential represented by this customer segment, retailers try to please them by means of green communication advertising and messages (Taken Smith, 2014). By following this strategy, retailers have been able to activate the conative component of consumers’ attitudes, <b>making</b> <b>them</b> purchase <b>green</b> products. Millennials are attracted by catchwords such as “eco-friendly”, “green”, “social responsible” or “recycled” accompanying the promotion of sustainable products (Smith, 2010). The use of these catchwords on packaging, as part of communication strategies and actions, have boosted product marketing and sales, leading to greater revenues for companies (Taken Smith, 2014). Unlike Millennials, Gen Xers are easier to “target” by means of advertisements, as they allow themselves to be more easily influenced by other people (Acar, 2014). Being pragmatic in character, they make decisions with full knowledge of the facts and information about products, services, brands, etc., often coming from members of the reference groups to which they belong or identify themselves with.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} pursuit a more {{eco-friendly}} lifestyle, many changes are {{being done to}} our daily life. One of these changes is the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). These zero emission and electricity driven vehicles have been proved {{to be effective in}} reducing roadside air pollution and green house gas emission. Not only are they able to assist in pollution reduction, EVs can also utilize renewable energy resources, <b>making</b> <b>them</b> much <b>greener</b> than conventional gasoline vehicles. The Hong Kong government has been promoting the adoption of EVs since 2010. They have been providing different kinds of incentives, such as tax exemptions and subsidies to companies for conducting EV trails. The government want to attract more people or companies to adopt EVs. Despite efforts of the government, EV is yet to be a significant kind of vehicle in Hong Kong. In my dissertation, I suggested a new way of promotion for EV adoption: integration of smart grid technology and EVs. The current smart grid technology development in Hong Kong is at a very primitive stage, {{there is a lot of}} space for improvement. For my study, I had conducted an opinion survey on people’s perception of both EV adoption and the introduction of smart grid. The survey results showed the top three reasons for people not to buy EVs are high price, insufficient range & battery capacity, and insufficient EV chargers. More importantly, the survey showed the willingness to purchase EVs increased from 23 % at the current situation to 56 % with smart grid being applied widely. From this result, I concluded that the use of smart grid technology would increase people’s willingness to purchase EV. Based on these results, I have suggested the government and electricity companies should focus future EV promotion in the following areas: solution to range anxiety of people, smart grid technology in Hong Kong, dynamic electricity tariff system, integration of renewable energy into generation fuel mix and development on V 2 G application. At the end of my paper, I have given out some possible ways of improvement for the government to better its EV promotion policies in the future. The suggested improvements are focused on specific subsidy schemes for EV upgrades, regulations for EV charger use and construction, and development of a steering committee for smart grid adoption. Possible topics for future studies base on this paper are also suggested in the ending chapter. published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|R
