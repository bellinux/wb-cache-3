40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to increase}} the academic debate on which indicators and approaches capture more appropriately the phenomenon of economic clustering (see, for instance, Arbia & Piras, 2007). A composite measure is proposed combining discrete and continuous space indicators {{in order to identify}} spatial localization more effectively as proposed by several authors such as Arbia (2001), Guillain and Le Gallo (2007), and Sohn (2004). The paper is devoted to unfolding the localization patterns of employment within three-digit manufacturing industries by Italian provinces in 2007 employing the location quotient, the locational Gini, the global Moran’s I, and the local indicator of spatial associations since they provide complementary information (see, for instance, Guillain & Le Gallo, 2007). Evidence shows that the manufacture of <b>military</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>vehicles</b> has the highest localization with almost full concentration; whereas the industry of other general-purpose machinery holds the highest global Moran’s I. Moreover, the five three-digit industries within the two-digit manufacture of machinery and equipment n. e. c. show a relatively high global autocorrelation and concentration. It emerged that these five three-digit medium-high technology intensity industries showed numerous hot-spots clusters in the North of Italy, whereas the South of Italy and Islands were characterized by low-low values associationsa mong Italian provinces in 2007...|$|E

The CFE treaty stipulates an infantry <b>fighting</b> <b>vehicle</b> is an APC with a cannon in excess of 20 mm, and with this additional firepower the vehicle is more involved in combat, providing fire support to dismounted infantry.|$|R
