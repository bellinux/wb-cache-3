5|$|After the First World War, {{many new}} food {{products}} became available to the typical household, with branded foods advertised for their convenience. Kitchen servants with time to make custards and puddings were replaced with instant foods in jars, or powders that the housewife could quickly mix. American-style dry cereals began to challenge the porridge and bacon and eggs of the middle classes, and the bread and <b>margarine</b> of the poor. While wartime shipping shortages had sharply narrowed choice, the 1920s saw many new kinds of fruit imported from around the world, along with better quality, packaging, and hygiene, aided by refrigerators and refrigerated ships.|$|E
40|$|Physicochemical {{properties}} of commercially available European bakery <b>margarines</b> (cream <b>margarines,</b> cake <b>margarines</b> [CM] and puff pastry <b>margarines</b> [PPM]) containing and devoid of {{trans fatty acids}} (TFAs) were investigated. Studied physical properties were the solid fat content (SFC), dropping points (DPs), polymorphism, texture (hardness), plasticity and the melting profile by differential scanning calorimetry. Experimental results confirm that physical {{properties of}} the <b>margarines</b> corresponded with their application area. For example, SFC and DPs of PPM were higher than cream <b>margarines</b> and CM; they were also harder at 15 C. Moreover, all the investigated physical properties were affected by the suppression of TFA in bakery <b>margarines.</b> PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS This study has shown that <b>margarines</b> present different physical properties {{with respect to their}} purposed application but also highlight changes that appear due to the absence of trans-fatty acids in the formulations. These changes can really affect the bakery abilities and will, finally, influence the quality of the bakery products. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The {{content of}} fatty acids in <b>margarines</b> and cooking fats {{changes over time}} due to product development. To receive current {{nutrient}} values on the fat quality in the most common <b>margarines</b> in Sweden, fatty acids were analysed during 2009 and 2010 at the National Food Agency. The whole range of fatty acids and trans fatty acids were analysed, {{and the content of}} saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat as well as omega- 3 and omega- 6 fatty acids were calculated in the <b>margarines.</b> The result shows that the most common <b>margarines</b> and cooking fats on the Swedish market now has a content of trans fatty acids below 1 percent (except the ones containing dairy fat). This {{is an example of the}} adaptability of the Swedish food industry to demands from authorities and consumers. The National Food Agency will continue to analyse <b>margarines</b> and cooking fats in order to control that the content of trans fatty acids remains low in Swedish food products...|$|R

In March 1924, she completed her 50th voyage on that route. In 1928, though, Suevic was showing her age, and White Star sold her to Yngvar Hvistendahl's Finnhval A/S for £35,000, who renamed her Skytteren and sent her to Germaniawerft at Kiel to be converted into a whaling factory ship. She served with the Norwegian whaling fleets in Antarctic waters. 1936 AS Finnhval came under control of the Norwegian shipping agent Jørgen Krag who handled on behalf of the German <b>Margarine</b> Union.

5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19thcentury {{industrialisation}} came into full effect and a number of new industries emerged around production and refinement of agricultural products, especially oil and butter. Many companies from this time would come to leave permanent iconic marks on Aarhus. The Ceres Brewery was established in 1856 and served as Aarhus' local brewery for more than 150 years, gradually expanding into an industrial district known as Ceres-grunden (lit.: the Ceres-grounds). In 1896 local farmers and businessmen created Korn- og Foderstof Kompagniet (KFK), focused on grain and feedstuffs. KFK established departments all over the country, while its headquarters remained in Aarhus where its large grain silos still stand today. Otto Mønsted created the Danish Preserved Butter Company in 1874, focusing on butter export to England, China and Africa and later founded the Aarhus Butterine Company in 1883, the first Danish <b>margarine</b> factory. The industry became an important employer, with factory employees increasing from 100 in 1896 to 1,000 in 1931, effectively transforming the city from a regional trade hub into an industrial centre. Other new factories of note included the dockyard Aarhus Flydedok, the oil mill Århus Oliefabrik and the ironworks Frichs.|$|E

25|$|Per capita butter {{consumption}} {{declined in}} most western nations during the 20th century, {{in large part}} because of the rising popularity of <b>margarine,</b> which is less expensive and, until recent years, was perceived as being healthier.

25|$|Like Ireland, France became {{well known}} for its butter, {{particularly}} in Normandy and Brittany. By the 1860s, butter had become so in demand in France that Emperor Napoleon III offered prize money for an inexpensive substitute to supplement France's inadequate butter supplies. A French chemist claimed the prize with the invention of <b>margarine</b> in 1869. The first <b>margarine</b> was beef tallow flavored with milk and worked like butter; vegetable <b>margarine</b> followed after the development of hydrogenated oils around 1900.|$|E

50|$|Modern <b>margarines</b> can be {{made from}} any {{of a wide variety of}} animal or {{vegetable}} fats, mixed with skim milk, salt, and emulsifiers. <b>Margarines</b> and vegetable fat spreads found in the market can range from 10 to 90% fat. Depending on its final fat content and its purpose (spreading, cooking or baking), the level of water and the vegetable oils used vary slightly. The oil is pressed from seeds and refined. It is then blended with solid fat. If no solid fats are added to the vegetable oils, the latter undergo a full or partial hydrogenation process to solidify them. The resulting blend is mixed with water, citric acid, carotenoids, vitamins and milk powder. Emulsifiers such as lecithin help disperse the water phase evenly throughout the oil, and salt and preservatives are also commonly added. This oil-and-water emulsion is then heated, blended, and cooled. The softer tub <b>margarines</b> are made with less hydrogenated, more liquid, oils than block <b>margarines.</b>|$|R

40|$|Fat spreads are {{composed}} of liquid oil, fat crystals and water. The fat crystals in these products give the product the required consistency and stabilize the water droplets. Shortenings are waterfree products, the rheology of which depends on the solid fat content and interactions between fat crystals. Size and interaction between crystals is influenced by both composition and processing. Crystals form a three - dimensional network. Recrystallization phenomena, especially formation of large beta- crystals, can create product defects like sandiness. <b>Margarines</b> and halvarines are water- in - oil emulsions and have a relatively simple product structure. Because of the wettability of fat crystals, part of the solids {{are present in the}} water/oil interface, and influence the stability of the emulsion. Depending on the type of application, tropical <b>margarines,</b> table <b>margarines,</b> halvarines, puff-pastry, c reaming <b>margarines,</b> etc., the ratio of solidlliquid and water content can be varied. No essential differences exist in the microstructure of products for different applications. Butter differs in its microstructure from <b>margarines</b> because of different processing and raw materials. Butter still contains a number of fat globules (derived from the cream) in its final product structure. These globules are dispersed in a matrix of fat crystals and oil desc ending from fat globules that were broken during churning. Also the moisture is present in different forms ranging from droplets to 2 ̆ 2 free moisture 2 ̆ 2. Differences in microstructure can be introduced by different processing regimes...|$|R

Materials and methodsa counting of labels of <b>margarines</b> and spreads most commercialized in chain supermarkets of five localities in Bogotá that included different socio-economical strata, was made. The first seventeen trademarks and three study brand marks were chosen for the study. Five samples by product were taken and analyzed, one by each locality, between August and November 2008. Resultsthe majority fatty acids were palmitic, oleic and linoleic acids, and four products are sources of trans fatty acids (4. 4 g y 6. 9 g/ 100 g).
