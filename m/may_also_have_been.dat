5|$|Anglesey {{in modern}} Wales <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{part of the}} insular Viking world from an early stage.|$|E
5|$|Withburga, {{who died}} in 743, <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> her sister.|$|E
5|$|According to officials, the {{sinkhole}} had similarities {{with another}} Guatemalan sinkhole which collapsed in 2007, which <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> formed by ruptured sewage pipes.|$|E
50|$|Eurymedousa, {{daughter}} of Cletor or Achelous. Zeus approached and seduced {{her in the}} form of an ant, she <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> transformed into an ant. As a result, she gave birth to Myrmidon.|$|R
50|$|The {{cause of}} {{extinction}} {{is not well}} established, but it was likely hunted for meat, and its bones and feathers were used in old style art. It <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> attacked by Polynesian rats that were introduced by the natives by accident.|$|R
50|$|Stephen I, Patriarch of Constantinople, who <b>may</b> <b>also</b> {{actually}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{a son of}} Michael III.|$|R
5|$|Although Charles II's anti-French Parliament {{had forced}} England to {{withdraw}} from the Franco-Dutch War in 1674, some English regiments remained in French service. In April Churchill was appointed the colonelcy of one such regiment, thereafter serving with, and learning from, the great Marshal Turenne. Churchill was present at the hard-fought battles of Sinsheim in June 1674, and Enzheim in October; he <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> present at Sasbach in July 1675, where Turenne was killed.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} decades Hines drifted between jobs and countries, including spending {{three years in}} the King's Liverpool Regiment and serving as a guide in the Second Boer War, before arriving in Australia in mid-1914. He was a large man and much of his body was covered in tattoos. Hines <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> illiterate, though he was capable of signing his name.|$|E
5|$|General Eisenhower issued {{orders to}} {{preserve}} the building during the bombardment of Frankfurt, because he intended to use it after the war as his headquarters. It <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> that the building was saved by its proximity to Grüneburgpark with its prisoner of war camp holding captured American airmen.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause of}} {{extinction}} {{is not very}} well known, but we can speculate that it was hunted for meat, and that its bones and feathers were used for decoration. It <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> attacked by the Polynesian rats that were introduced by early settlers.|$|R
50|$|It <b>may</b> well <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the {{residence}} of Virgil, the Roman poet of, most famously, the 'Aeneid'.|$|R
50|$|The {{mitochondria}} in eukaryotic cells <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> originally <b>been</b> such parasites, {{but ended}} up forming a mutualistic relationship (endosymbiotic theory).|$|R
5|$|Large scale {{changes in}} weather {{patterns}} <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> caused by global dimming. Climate modelers speculatively {{suggest that this}} reduction in solar radiation at the surface {{may have led to}} the failure of the monsoon in sub-Saharan Africa during the 1970s and 1980s, together with the associated famines such as the Sahel drought, caused by Northern hemisphere pollution cooling the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|The Epistles are {{admired for}} the way that their poetry and music fit so well together. Bellman chose not to compose the tunes, instead {{borrowing}} and adapting existing melodies, most likely to exploit the humour of contrasting the associations of well-known tunes with the meanings he gave them. This <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> intended to provide historical depth to his work; he sometimes devoted considerable energy to adapting melodies to fit an Epistle's needs.|$|E
5|$|The {{balance of}} Iowans {{activities}} {{over the next}} two years are unclear. She may have been in the half of the American-Hawaiian fleet that was chartered for transatlantic service. She <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in the group of American-Hawaiian ships chartered for service to South America, delivering coal, gasoline, and steel in exchange for coffee, nitrates, cocoa, rubber, and manganese ore.|$|E
50|$|Deposits {{for this}} type of event may be higher than normal first tee starts. Cancellation notices <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> to <b>be</b> {{presented}} further in advance.|$|R
5000|$|Any other statement-related grammar rules <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> to <b>be</b> {{duplicated}} in {{this way}} if they may directly or indirectly end with a [...] or [...] non-terminal.|$|R
25|$|There <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>been</b> a glottal stop.|$|R
5|$|The {{hills in}} the {{locality}} such as Bathampton Down saw human activity from the Mesolithic period. Several Bronze Age round barrows were opened by John Skinner in the 18th century. Solsbury Hill overlooking the current city was an Iron Age hill fort, and the adjacent Bathampton Camp <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> one. A long barrow site {{believed to be}} from the Beaker people was flattened to make way for RAF Charmy Down.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} hole in {{the roof}} for the entry of the pigeons was covered by a flat stone and is now covered with glass to keep the interior dry. The interior of the roof has putlog holes rather than nesting boxes but <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used by pigeons.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape of}} the nasal {{chambers}} of Ankylosaurus indicate that airflow was unidirectional, (looping through the lungs during inhalation and exhalation), although it <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> bidirectional in the posterior nasal chamber, which directed air past the olfactory lobes. The enlarged olfactory region of ankylosaurids indicates a well-developed sense of smell, and {{the position of the}} orbits of Ankylosaurus suggest some stereoscopic vision.|$|E
5000|$|The {{small body}} of {{evidence}} available for Runic texts suggests that there <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> a <b>been</b> a separate locative case in early or Northumbrian forms of the language (e.g., [...] on rodi [...] "on the Cross").|$|R
50|$|He <b>also</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{inspired}} by Jean-François Millet's The Church at Greville.|$|R
5000|$|He {{had many}} {{students}} including his son Cyriacus Bril, Luigi Carboni, Balthasar Lauwers, Willem van Nieulandt II, Pieter Spierinckx, Agostino Tassi and Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom. [...] Karel Philips Spierincks <b>may</b> <b>also</b> briefly <b>have</b> <b>been</b> his pupil.|$|R
5|$|The {{value of}} Marquis' work was {{properly}} recognized only after his death. Liberty and {{others believe that}} {{it took so long}} to publish much of his work because of his controversial theory on the suicide of Custer's men. Historian Brian Dippie suggests that the Great Depression <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a contributing factor.|$|E
5|$|These {{operations}} {{contributed to}} victory by diverting enemy attention from real targets to dummy ones, wasting enemy ammunition, preserving vital {{resources such as}} the single water desalination plant at Tobruk, and deceiving the enemy as to allied strength and intentions. Operation Bertram <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the last ever army-scale physical deception, since subsequent major deceptions, including those for the D-Day landings in Normandy, have included electronic measures.|$|E
5|$|Americans exact {{movements}} {{from this}} time through early 1917 are unclear. She {{may have been in}} the half of the American-Hawaiian fleet that was chartered for transatlantic service. She <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in the group of American-Hawaiian ships chartered for service to South America, delivering coal, gasoline, and steel in exchange for coffee, nitrates, cocoa, rubber, and manganese ore. However, when the United States entered World War I in April 1917, the entire American-Hawaiian fleet, including American, was requisitioned by the , which then returned the ships for operation by American-Hawaiian.|$|E
50|$|Other {{types of}} {{containers}} such as boxes and drums <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> closures but <b>are</b> not {{discussed in this}} article.|$|R
25|$|These vigilante actions <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>been</b> {{a source}} for the {{continued}} Danite myth.|$|R

5|$|As noted, {{there is}} bonebed {{evidence}} that this genus lived in groups during {{at least part of}} the year. Additionally, it had several potential methods for display in a social setting. The bony facial crest is an obvious candidate, and nasal diverticula <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> present. These postulated diverticula would have taken the form of inflatable soft-tissue sacs housed in the deep excavations flanking the crest and elongate holes for the nostrils. Such sacs could be used for both visual and auditory signals.|$|E
5|$|During {{the post}} medieval period {{until the early}} 18th century it served as a {{hospital}} for the local population. In 1829 repairs were carried out to the church. Excavations in 1885 found floor tiles with coats of arms and a pavement from the 14th century beneath which were several coffins. According {{to the findings of}} later resistivity and gradiometer surveys there <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a formal Tudor garden and there may have been fish ponds.|$|E
5|$|Early {{members of}} the ceratopsian group, such as Psittacosaurus, were small bipedal animals. Later members, {{including}} ceratopsids like Centrosaurus and Triceratops, became very large quadrupeds and developed elaborate facial horns and frills extending over the neck. While these frills might have served to protect the vulnerable neck from predators, they <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used for display, thermoregulation, the attachment of large neck and chewing muscles {{or some combination of}} the above. Ceratopsians ranged in size from 1meter (3ft) and 23kilograms (50lb) to over 9meters (30ft) and 9,100kg (20,100lb).|$|E
50|$|These vigilante actions <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>been</b> {{a source}} for the {{continued}} Danite myth.|$|R
50|$|The minimum {{curve radius}} of narrow-gauge {{railways}} is often less than on tracks with a wider gauge, so route deviations might be required to allow the radius of curves to be increased. Track centers at stations with multiple tracks <b>may</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> to <b>be</b> increased.|$|R
5000|$|In {{classical}} Latin uncialis {{could mean}} both [...] "inch-high" [...] and [...] "weighing an ounce", {{and it is}} possible that Jerome was punning on this; he <b>may</b> conceivably <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> playing with the other meaning of codex, [...] "block of wood".|$|R
