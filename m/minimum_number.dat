40|$|Given two maps between smooth manifolds, the {{obstruction}} to removing their coincidences (via homotopies) {{is measured}} by <b>minimum</b> <b>numbers.</b> In order to determine them we introduce and study an infinite hierarchy of Nielsen numbers N_i, i = 0, 1, [...] ., ∞. They approximate the <b>minimum</b> <b>numbers</b> from below with decreasing accuracy, but they are (in principle) more easily computable as i grows. If the domain and the target manifold have the same dimension (e. g. in the fixed point setting) all these Nielsen numbers agree with the classical definition. However, in general they can be quite distinct. While our approach is very geometric the computations use the techniques of homotopy theory and, in particular, all versions of Hopf invariants (a la Ganea, Hilton, James [...] ). As an illustration we determine all Nielsen <b>numbers</b> and <b>minimum</b> <b>numbers</b> for pairs of maps from spheres to spherical space forms.

30|$|Described {{here is a}} {{simplified}} method for fabrication of DNA nanotubes using a <b>minimum</b> <b>numbers</b> of staple oligomers for DNA origami. For this purpose, the cylindrical nanotemplates with two sticky ends have been designed using caDNAno software. Then, the nanostructures were shaped in an optimized experimental condition via an origami-based self-assembly reaction. Finally, the produced nanostructures were joined together through their sticky ends using a ligase enzyme. Transmission electron microscope confirmed fabrication of these elongated nanotubes. In addition, high-resolution microscopy of DNA nanotubes by scanning tunnelling microscope indicated efficient attachments of the primarily DNA nanostructures via their sticky ends. The results demonstrated that a ligase treatment of cylindrical DNA nanostructures with the sticky ends made DNA nanotubes with standard shapes using <b>minimum</b> <b>numbers</b> of staples.|$|R

5|$|A {{systemic}} transformation happening {{sooner rather}} than later was made possible by the Polish legislative elections of 4 June 1989, which coincided with the bloody crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protesters in China. When the results of the voting were released, a political earthquake followed. The victory of Solidarity surpassed all predictions. Solidarity candidates captured all the seats they were allowed to compete for in the Sejm, while in the newly established Senate they captured 99 out of the 100 available seats (the other seat went to an independent, who later switched to Solidarity). At the same time, many prominent PZPR candidates failed to gain even the <b>minimum</b> <b>number</b> of votes required to capture the seats that were reserved for them.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients seen as 'extras' (or 'fit-ins') {{are usually}} given {{less time for}} their {{problems}} than those in pre-booked appointments. Consequently, long queues of 'extras' should be avoided. AIM: To determine whether a predictable relationship exists {{between the number of}} available appointments {{at the start of the}} day and the number of extra patients who must be fitted in. This might be used to help plan a practice appointment system. METHOD: Numbers of available appointments at the start of the day and numbers of 'extras' seen were recorded prospectively in 1995 and 1997 in one group general practice. <b>Minimum</b> <b>numbers</b> of available appointments at the start of the day, below which undesirably large numbers of extra patients could be predicted, were determined using logistic regression applied to the 1995 data. Predictive values of the <b>minimum</b> <b>numbers</b> calculated for 1995, in terms of predicting undesirable numbers of 'extras', were then determined when applied to the 1997 data. RESULTS: Numbers of extra patients seen correlated negatively with available appointments at the start of the day for all days of the week, with coefficients ranging from - 0. 66 to - 0. 80. <b>Minimum</b> <b>numbers</b> of available appointments below which undesirably large numbers of extras could be predicted were 26 for Mondays and four for the other week-days. When applied to 1997 data, these <b>minimum</b> <b>numbers</b> gave positive and negative predictive values of 76 % and 82 % respectively, similar to their values for 1995, despite increases in patient attendance and changes in the day-to-day pattern of surgery provision between the two years. CONCLUSION: A predictable relationship exists between the number of available appointments at the start of the day and the number of extras who must be fitted in, which may be used to help plan the appointment system for some years ahead, at least in this relatively stable suburban practice...|$|R
