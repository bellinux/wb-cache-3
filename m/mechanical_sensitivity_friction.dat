A {{variety of}} seemingly diverse pain syndromes {{are characterized by}} movement-induced pain radiating {{in the distribution of}} a peripheral nerve or nerve root. This could be explained by the induction of ectopic <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in intact sensory axons. Here we show that inflammation led to <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of the axons of a subset of mechanically sensitive primary sensory neurons.

No axons of any category were mechanically sensitive in control experiments. However, the axons of neurons innervating deep structures and having C- or A-conduction velocities became mechanically sensitive during the neuritis, and also exhibited an increased incidence of spontaneous discharge.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} application of a lever coupling mechanism to improve the shock resistance of a dual-mass silicon micro-gyroscope with drive mode coupled along the driving direction without sacrificing the <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> Firstly, the <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and the shock response of the micro-gyroscope are theoretically analyzed. In the mechanical design, a novel lever coupling mechanism is proposed to change the modal order and to improve the frequency separation. The micro-gyroscope with the lever coupling mechanism optimizes the drive mode order, increasing the in-phase mode frequency to be {{much larger than the}} anti-phase one. Shock analysis results show that the micro-gyroscope structure with the designed lever coupling mechanism can notably reduce the magnitudes of the shock response and cut down the stress produced in the shock process compared with the traditional elastic coupled one. Simulations reveal that the shock resistance along the drive direction is greatly increased. Consequently, the lever coupling mechanism can change the gyroscope’s modal order and improve the frequency separation by structurally offering a higher stiffness difference ratio. The shock resistance along the driving direction is tremendously enhanced without loss of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensitivity...</b>|$|R

Modelling of condenser microphones, which can {{be considered to be}} a special type of capacitive pressure sensor, usually requires a more complicated analysis of the sensitivity, because they have a strong electric field in the air gap. It is found that the <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of condenser microphones with a circular diaphragm, either with a large initial tension or without any initial tension, increases with increasing bias voltage (and the corresponding static deflection), whereas the <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of other capacitive pressure sensors does not depend on the static deflection.

In addition, the open-circuit electrical sensitivity and, consequently, the total sensitivity too, also increases with increasing bias voltage (or static deflection). However, the maximum allowable sound pressure at which the diaphragm collapses, an effect that has to be taken into account, decreases with increasing static deflection in most cases, ulthnately resulting in an optimum value for the bias voltage.

Guilford Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, Edwardsville, Illinois; e-mail: dumbaug@siue. edu Diabetic {{neuropathy}} is {{a common}} complication of diabetes that reduces {{the quality of life}} for millions of Americans. Overweight humans with dyslipidemia develop neuropathy before developing overt diabetes. In addition, recent evidence indicates a high-fat diet induces signs of neuropathy in rodents and may contribute to the development of neuropathy in pre-diabetic and/or diabetic humans, but mechanisms underlying high-fat diet induced neuropathy have not been elucidated. PURPOSE: The overall aim was to identify neuronal inflammation as a potential mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of high-fat diet-induced neuropathy. These experiments tested the hypothesis that a HF diet induces neuronal inflammation.

40|$|Abstract Background Trigeminal nerve is a {{major source}} of the sensory input of the face, and trigeminal {{neuropathology}} models have been reported in rodents with injury to branches of the maxillary or mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve. Non-human primates are neuroanatomically more closely related to human than rodents; however, nerve injury studies in non-human primates are limited. Results We describe here a nerve injury model of maxillary nerve compression (MNC) in the cynomolgus macaque monkey, Macaca fascicularis, and the initial characterization of the consequences of damage to this trigeminal nerve branch. The nerve injury from the compression appeared to be mild, as we did not observe overt changes in home-cage behavior in the monkeys. When mechanical stimulation was applied to the facial area, monkeys with MNC displayed increased <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> as the avoidance response scores were lower than those from the control animals. Such a change in <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensitivity</b> appeared to be somewhat bilateral, as the contralateral side also showed increased <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> although the change on the ipsilateral side was more robust. Multiple-unit recording of the maxillary nerve showed a general pattern of increasing responsiveness to escalating force in mechanical stimulation on the contralateral side. Ipsilateral side of the maxillary nerve showed a lack of responsiveness to escalating force in mechanical stimulation, possibly reflecting a maximum stimulation threshold effect from sensitized nerve due to MNC injury. Conclusions These results suggest that MNC may produce increased sensitivity of the ipsilateral maxillary nerve, and that this model may serve as a non-human primate model to evaluate the effect of injury to trigeminal nerve branches. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} is an in vivo {{investigation}} into {{the time course of}} inflammation-induced axonal <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensitivity</b> (AMS) in intact C-fiber axons. After induction of a localized neuritis in the rat sciatic nerve, AMS developed in C-fiber axons at 1 (18. 2 %) and 4 weeks (11. 6 %). By 8 weeks, AMS was virtually absent (2. 1 %). AMS was also tested in intact L 5 neurons after L 4 spinal nerve transection, which induces a diffuse inflammation within the sciatic nerve. At 1 week, AMS developed in 10 % of neurons. No AMS was observed in unoperated animals. The localized neuritis also caused changes in L 5 dorsal root conduction velocities (CVs). CVs decreased at 1 week (- 7. 7 %) and 4 weeks (- 17. 6 %) and returned to normal by 8 weeks. L 4 transection similarly reduced CVs (- 13. 7 %) of L 5 dorsal root axons. There were no significant changes among any groups in the proportion or rate of ongoing activity. These results demonstrate that the axonal changes due to neuritis are not permanent. Therefore, in patients with persistent movement-induced radiating limb pain with few clinically apparent signs of nerve damage, there may be a persisting inflammatory lesion affecting the nerve.

Early postnatal development of nociception in rats is associated with exaggerated and diffuse cutaneous reflexes with a gradual refinement of responses over the first postnatal weeks related to increased participation of inhibitory networks. This study examined the postnatal development of lamina I projection neurons from postnatal day 3 (P 3) until P 48. Results At P 3, a subset of lamina I neurons were found to express the neurokinin 1 (NK 1) receptor.

Methods: In two separate sessions, 15 healthy males received a hypertonic (painful) and isotonic (control) saline injection to either the adductor longus (AL) tendon to produce experimental groin pain or into the rectus femoris (RF) tendon as a painful control. Pain intensity was recorded on a visual analogue scale (VAS) with pain distribution indicated on body maps. Pressure pain thresholds (PPT) were assessed bilaterally in the groin area. Electromyography (EMG) of relevant muscles was recorded during six provocation tests. PPT and EMG assessment were measured before, during and after experimental pain. Results: Hypertonic saline induced higher VAS scores than isotonic saline (p < 0. 001), and a local pain distribution in 80 % of participants. A proximal pain referral to the lower abdominal region in 33 % (AL) and 7 % (RF) of participants. Experimental pain (AL and RF) did not significantly alter PPT values or the EMG amplitude in groin or trunk muscles during provocation tests when forces were matched with baseline. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that AL tendon pain was distributed locally {{in the majority of}} participants but may refer to the lower abdomen. Experimental adductor pain did not significantly alter the <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensitivity</b> or muscle activity patterns...|$|R

Diabetic neuropathic pain is reduced with tight glycemic control. However, strict control {{increases the risk of}} hypoglycemic episodes, which are themselves linked to painful neuropathy. This study explored the effects of hypoglycemia-related painful neuropathy. Pretreatment with coenzyme Q 10 (CoQ 10) was performed to explore the preventive effect of CoQ 10 on hypoglycemia-related acute neuropathic pain. Two strains ofmicewere used and 1 unit/kg of insulinwas given to induce hypoglycemia. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of hindpaw withdrawal thresholds was measured using von Frey filaments. Blood glucose levels were clamped at normal levels by joint insulin and glucose injection to test whether insulin itself induced hypersensitivity. Results suggest that the increased <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensitivity</b> after insulin injection is related to decreased blood glucose levels. When blood glucose levels remained at a normal level by the linked administration of insulin and glucose,mice demonstrated no significant change inmechanical sensitivity. PretreatmentwithCoQ 10 prevented neuropathic pain and the expression of the stress factor c-Fos. These results support the concept that pain in the diabetic scenario can be the result of hypoglycemia and not insulin itself. Additionally, pretreatment with CoQ 10 may be a potent preventive method for the development of neuropathic pain. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} design and {{simulation}} of a 4 mm 2 double differential torsional MEMS accelerometer based on a double-beam configuration. Based {{on the structure of}} conventional torsional accelerometers, normally composed of one pair of proof masses and one torsional beam, this work explores the double differential configuration: a torsional accelerometer with two pairs of unbalanced proof masses rotating in reverse. Also, the torsional beam is designed as a double-beam structure, which is a symmetrical structure formed by two torsional beams separated by a certain distance. The device area of the novel accelerometer is more than 50 times smaller than that of a traditional double differential torsional MEMS accelerometer. The FEM simulation results demonstrate that the smaller device does not sacrifice other specifications, such as <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> nonlinearity and temperature robustness. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and nonlinearity of a ± 15 g measuring range is 59. 4 fF/g and 0. 88 %, respectively. Compared with traditional single-beam silicon structures, the novel structure can achieve lower maximum principle stress in critical regions and reduce the possibility of failure when high-g acceleration loading is applied along all three axes. The mechanical noise equivalent acceleration is about 0. 13 mg / Hz in the theoretical calculations and the offset temperature coefficient is 0. 25 mg/ ℃ in the full temperature range of − 40 ℃ to 60 ℃...|$|R
