40|$|When the MFFD <b>program</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> in 2012, {{its general}} {{goal was to}} gain a deeper {{understanding}} of multifunctional flood defenses, in order to provide a solid foundation for their design, assessment and management. As a point of departure, it assumed that a new generation of explicitly multifunctional flood defenses was the product of a need to accommodate competing spatial claims, and, perhaps, contribute financial savings by combining functions. Flagship projects like the Scheveningen Boulevard and Katwijk’s ‘hybrid’ parking garage complement an older generation of multifunctional flood defenses, the traditional example being dikes with sheep grazing or a road on top. The contemporary multifunctional flood defense was viewed as a complex but desirable phenomenon: the answer to multiple needs, and therefore best studied from a multidisciplinary perspective. </p...|$|R
50|$|Brij Kothari was {{watching}} a Spanish film on video with English subtitles during a break from dissertation writing in 1996 when the thought hit him that if all Hindi film songs were subtitled in Hindi, on television in India, it would bring about a revolution in literacy.

While continuing to teach communication to MBA students, he started work on SLS and it became a project of IIM.

2500|$|Neighborhood Watch {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} and most {{effective}} crime prevention programs in the country, bringing citizens together with law enforcement to deter crime and make communities safer. Sponsored by the National Sheriffs’ Association (NSA), Neighborhood Watch can trace its roots back to the days of colonial settlements, when night watchmen patrolled the streets. The modern version of Neighborhood Watch was developed in response to requests from sheriffs and police chiefs who were looking for a crime prevention program that would involve citizens and address an increasing number of burglaries. Launched in 1972, Neighborhood Watch counts on citizens to organize themselves and work with law enforcement to keep a trained eye and ear on their communities, while demonstrating their presence at all times of day and night. (The <b>program</b> <b>took</b> <b>off</b> quickly: in just ten years, NSA data showed that 12 percent of the population was involved in a Neighborhood Watch.) ...|$|R
