The system, designated [...] "Safe Action" [...] by Glock, consists of an external integrated trigger safety and two automatic internal safeties: a firing pin safety, and a drop safety. The external safety is a small inner lever contained in the trigger. Pressing the lever activates the trigger bar and sheet <b>metal</b> <b>connector.</b> The firing pin safety is a solid hardened steel pin that, in the secured state, blocks the firing pin channel (disabling the firing pin in its longitudinal axis). It is pushed upward to release the firing pin for firing only when the trigger is actuated and the safety is pushed up through the backward movement of the trigger bar. The drop safety guides the trigger bar in a ramp that is released only when direct rearward pressure {{is applied to the}} trigger. The three safety mechanisms are automatically disengaged one after the other when the trigger is squeezed, and are automatically reactivated when the trigger is released. This passive safety system omits the manipulation of traditional on-off levers, hammers, or other external safeties as found in many other handgun designs. The ability to fire immediately, without worrying about an external safety, is one feature Glock has stressed as an advantage when selling its guns, especially to police departments.|$|E

The War Games match was the conclusion of a long running storyline between a group known as The Dangerous Alliance, led by Manager Paul E. Dangerously and a group of faces led by Sting. The storyline began in the fall of 1991 with the formation of the Alliance as Rick Rude, Steve Austin, Arn Anderson, Bobby Eaton and Larry Zbyszko had joined forces in WCW. Sting's team included Barry Windham, Dustin Rhodes, Ricky Steamboat and Nikita Koloff, all of whom had individual storyline feuds with members of the Dangerous Alliance. The match ended when Zbyszko accidentally hit Bobby Eaton in the shoulder with the <b>metal</b> <b>connector</b> from a turnbuckle, this left Eaton open to an armbar submission hold from Sting to win the match for Sting's Squadron. Following the match the Alliance fell apart. The fifth match of the night was originally announced as Ron Simmons teaming up with the Junkyard Dog to face Mr. Hughes and Cactus Jack in a tag team match, but before the match Jack attacked the Junkyard Dog. The storyline was to cover for Junkyard Dog suffering an injury, allowing WCW to replace the match with a match between Simmons and Hughes. The Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott) did not put the WCW World Tag Team Championship on the line against Tatsumi Fujinami and Takayuki Iizuka, instead it was to determine the next team to challenge for New Japan Pro Wrestling's IWGP Tag Team Championship.|$|E

Cilj provedenih eksperimentalnih ispitivanja je bio da se utvrdi nosivost spojeva ostvarenih čavlastim metalnim spojnicama, u skladu s odredbama Eurokoda 5. Eksperimentalno ispitivanje je provedeno na više uzoraka, opterećivanjem uzoraka do dostizanja granične nosivosti spoja izvedenog čavlastim metalnim spojnicama. Diskusija rezultata ispitivanja je obuhvatila analizu granične nosivosti spoja za različite vrijednosti pomicanja spoja, usporedbu dobivenih rezultata s karakterističnom nosivošću standardnih tipova metalnih spojnica i računskom nosivošću čavla po teoriji granične nosivosti.

The prototype <b>metal</b> <b>connector</b> plates in MPC joints were modeled using thin galvanized sheet metal and short staples. Truss grade wood material was ripped to one-third scale dimensions to be used as the modeling material. Prototype tension splice joints were modeled with 48, one-quarter inch staples embedded in each model connection with each pair of prototype teeth approximated by a single staple tooth. Heel joints were modeled with 60, one-quarter inch staples embedded in each model heel joint connection. The remaining truss connections were developed from projections based on tension splice joint and heel joint designs. To provide verification of the model material properties, a modulus of elasticity (MOE) study was performed that compared prototype and one-third scale model boards.
