5000|$|Although {{machining}} metal was {{a method}} that was available to lock makers since the early 19th century, it was not economically feasible to do so until the very early 20th century when electrical generation and distribution became widespread. Some of the earliest padlocks (c. 1905) that were made from a machined block of cast or extruded metal resemble today's modern padlock. Corbin and Eagle {{were one of the}} first lock makers to machine a solid block of metal and insert a relatively new pin tumbler mechanism and a sliding shackle into the holes <b>machined</b> into the <b>body.</b> This style of padlock was both strong and easy to manufacture. Many <b>machined</b> <b>body</b> padlocks were designed to be disassembled so that locksmiths could easily fit the locks to a certain key. The <b>machined</b> <b>body</b> padlocks are still very popular today. The process of machining allows many modern padlocks to have a [...] "shroud" [...] covering the shackle, which is an extension of the body around the shackle to protect the shackle from getting sheared or cut.|$|R

40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to {{improvement}} of design technique of track <b>machines</b> <b>bodies</b> bearing structures. The review and analysis of state-of-the-art of the mathematical programming theory and the optimal designing are done. The numerical optimization procedure for track <b>machines</b> <b>bodies</b> bearing structures is proposed. The approbation of the proposed procedure is taken on structural optimization problems. Mathematical aspects of proposed procedure implementation are investigated, particularly the algorithm convergence and the sensitivity analysis of initial designs. Deflected mode of the ballast leveling machine SPZ- 5 /UA body bearing structure was investigated analytically (FEM study) and experimentally (trial running inspection on durability). The necessity of optimization implementation for bodies bearing structures is substantiated. The rational design of track machine SPZ- 5 /UA bearing structure was obtained with the numerical optimization procedure proposed in the paper. The deflected mode of the body rational bearing structure was investigated...|$|R

40|$|This {{essay will}} chart a {{geography}} of <b>machines,</b> <b>bodies,</b> and memories that is broad and far-reaching. The reader will travel through this terrain along a single winding path, via {{the tracks of}} film machines and dance <b>machines</b> (human <b>bodies),</b> taking extra time to pause, breathe, and reflect where the two intersect. A description of sensuous geographies as mediated through engagement with anachronistic machines (such as trains and film equipment) will prepare the reader for a journey in which the human body becomes implicated and integrated with the mechanical body. The impact of the <b>machine</b> on the <b>body</b> of the operator leaves traces that trigger memories; the human body itself becomes a machine in performance that excites memories in both the performer and the viewer. Our journey ends with the ephemeral and fleeting nature of these machines and media that are preserved in the transparence of our senses and memories...|$|R

5000|$|During {{the casting}} process, the {{finished}} mold spins along its central axis for anywhere from 30 seconds to several minutes {{depending upon the}} chosen casting material. Internally a spin casting machine or spin caster consists of a motor and pressure clamping system which holds and positions the mold properly while it spins at a steady rate.

5000|$|Rating {{not even}} a cover mention, the first {{installment}} of Jones' most popular creation, [...] "The Jameson Satellite", appeared in the July 1931 issue of Amazing Stories. The hero was Professor Jameson, the last Earthman, who became immortal through the science of the Zoromes. Jameson was obsessed {{with the idea of}} perfectly preserving his body after death and succeeded by having it launched into space in a small capsule. Jameson's body survived for 40,000,000 years, where it was found orbiting a dead planet Earth by a passing Zorome exploration ship. The Zoromes, or machine men as they sometimes called themselves, were cyborgs. They came from a race of biological beings who had achieved immortality by transferring their brains to machine bodies. They occasionally assisted members of other races with this transition (e.g. the Tri-Peds and the Mumes), allowing others to become Zoromes and join them on their expeditions, which sometimes lasted hundreds of years. So, much like the Borg of the Star Trek series, a Zorome crew could be made up of assimilated members of many different biological species. The Zoromes discovered that Jameson's body had been so well preserved {{that they were able to}} repair his brain, incorporate it into a Zorome <b>machine</b> <b>body</b> and restart it. The professor joined their crew and, over the course of the series, participated in many adventures, even visiting Zor, the Zorome homeworld, where he met biological Zoromes. The professor eventually rose to command his own crew of machine men on a new Zorome exploration ship. [...] "The Jameson Satellite" [...] proved so popular with readers that later installments in Amazing Stories got not only cover mentions but the cover artwork. The series eventually became some of the most popular and well-known of the 1930s pulps.|$|E
