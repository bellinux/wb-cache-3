The tested rotation system is an alternate biannual type where three forms of manure have been utilized : <b>mineral</b> <b>manure</b> (N 15 P 15 K 15); organic manure (snail faeces or trashes); combination of organic manure/mineral manure, that is snail faeces and N 15 P 15 K 15.

50|$|Erosion is {{strongly}} related to human activity. For example, roads which increase impermeable surfaces lead to streaming and ground loss. Agriculture also accelerates soil erosion (increase of field size, correlated to hedges and ditches removal). Meadows are in regression to the profit of plowed lands. Spring cultures (sunflower, corn, beet) surfaces are increasing and leave the ground naked in winter. Sloping grounds are gradually colonized by vine. Lastly, use of herbicides leaves the ground naked between each crop. New cultural practices, such as mechanization also increases the risks of erosion. Fertilization by <b>mineral</b> <b>manures</b> rather than organic manure gradually destructure the soil. Many scientists observed a gradual decrease of soil organic matter content in soils, {{as well as a}} decrease of soil biological activity (in particular, in relation to chemical uses). Lastly, deforestation, in particular, is responsible for degradation of forest soils.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} was to evaluate the <b>mineral</b> composition of <b>manure</b> and vermicomposite from castrated and intact cattle. The earthworm utilized was Eisenia foetida and the time for vermicomposite establishment was about 40 days. The experimental design was completely randomized in factorial scheme 2 x 2, two manure types (manure and vermicomposite) and two sexual conditions (castrated and intact). The manure from castrated animals presented higher nitrogen (26. 6 vs 22. 7 g/kg) and calcium (31. 9 vs 24. 0 g/kg) contents compared to intact animals, but both castrated and intact presented similar potassium content. The vermicomposite from castrated animals manure was higher on nitrogen (26. 2 vs 23. 9 g/kg), potassium (18. 0 vs 15. 0 g/kg) and calcium (33. 6 vs 31. 2 g/kg) than entire.

However, in last three decades, rice productivity per unit area has stagnated due to abiotic and biotic factors, hence {{the need for the}} application of Integrated Soil Fertility Management (ISFM) principles. Farmyard manure, crop residues are central to improving soil fertility in rice systems. Compared to <b>mineral</b> fertilizer, organic <b>manure</b> use results in higher rice yield gains. Symbiotic biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) by grain legumes has been successfully applied to improve rice yields. However, only a few legumes are suitable for use under flooded conditions. Application of Azolla sp. improves rice yields though drought and the need for inoculum limit widespread adoption. Poor quality organic fertilizers limit their effectiveness as macronutrient sources. Where soils are P deficient, BNF and animal manure technologies seem to be of little value. In conclusion, combinations of <b>mineral</b> fertilizers, farmyard <b>manure,</b> and short seasoned legumes have the potential of improving rice yields. Further research on the application of ecology specific ISFM technologies is required in view of land degradation and climate variability. Research is needed on suitable legumes, fertilizer equivalency values of organics, fortification of organic fertilizers, and effectiveness of combinations of mineral and organic fertility inputs. We propose a step-by-step innovative approach to improving rice productivity by incorporating the components of ISFM at different stages.

O Ãndice de Dickson de ambas as espÃcies resultaram em ausÃncia de efeitos significativos Esse resultado indica nÃo existir alteraÃÃo na alocaÃÃo proporcional do crescimento entre os sistemas aÃreos e radiculares das espÃcies estudadas em funÃÃo dos tipos e dos tempos de liberaÃÃo dos fertilizantes testados. Portanto a mortalidade de mudas apÃs o plantio com fertilizantes de liberaÃÃo lenta nÃo induziu maior sobrevivÃncia, os maiores incrementos para comprimento da muda, nÃmero de folhas e diÃmetro do coleto foram aos 180 dias apÃs o plantio, para o fertilizante (Basacote 3 M) avaliado aos 90 dias apÃs o plantio de mudas de Anadenanthera colubrina expressaram maior diÃmetro de coleto e maior nÃmero de folhas. E as mudas de Anadenanthera colubrina foram mais responsivas aos fertilizantes de liberaÃÃo lentaThe use of fertilizers {{of controlled}} liberation is {{made one of}} the modern techniques in the raising of Young plants. However, there are few reports of its effects on the growing in native forest species {{in the area of}} ciliar dominion. It has been aimed to try different fertilizers of controlled liberation with a convencional fertilizer in the establishment of young in the field of Anadenanthera colubrine and Tabebuia avellanedae. The young plants were taken from the municipal nursey of Palotina-Pr, and they were planted in an area of ciliar dominion, by fertilization in the hole, with Basacote 3 M, Basacote 6 M, Basacote 9 M, <b>mineral</b> <b>manure</b> in the formulation 16 - 08 - 12 (N, P 2 O 5, K 2 O) with dose of 55 grams in each hole and witness. The experiment was conducted by outlining casual blocks, with subdivided portions, in which the factors were made by three treatments of Basacote, one of <b>mineral</b> <b>manure</b> and witness. It was evaluated the following features: diameter of the coleto length, number of leaves, foliar area, dried biomass of the root, dried biomass area, length of the root, and average of Dickson`s. Along 90 days of cultivation, the tested fertilization Basacote 3 M influenced on the increment of the diameter of the coleto off Anadenanthera colubrine. With the increments of the length there was statistical difference amoing the species, with larger average (58, 96 cm) for the young plants of Tabebuia avellanedae and smaller average (48, 70 cm) to Anadenanthera colubrine. For the number of leaves, youngs plants of Anadenanthera colubrine showed better averages (150, 30). After 180 days of the plantations the young plants which received the treatment Basacote 9 M, got larger average (113, 37). Whereas, after 270 days of the plantation, the species Tabebuia avellanedae, got better results to the Basacote 3 M in increments of the length. In the 360 days of the plantation, the differences happened among the with bigger increments off coleto (7, 48 mm) to young plants of Tabebuia avellenedae. The destructive analyses dried biomass of root, didnât answer the treatments, showing difference between the species with larger average to Tabebuia avellanedae. Dried biomass of the airy part, both the species didnât answer the treatments. The length of the root, answered in a negative way to the treatments, where it happened differences only among the species with larger average to young plants off Anandenanthera colubrine. To variable foliar area, only after the 360 days off the plantation, young plants off Tabebuia avellanedae, showed larger average, without interference off the treatments. On the Dicksonâs, both species didnât suffer big affect...|$|R
40|$|In this study, using DRIFT and HR MAS NMR, we {{analyzed}} the humic substances isolated from a soil treated, over 40 years, with different organic, mineral and organic plus mineral treatments and cultivated with maize {{as the main}} crop. As expected, the structure of humic substances was very complex but by combining both techniques (DRIFT and HR MAS NMR) additional information was obtained on aromatic and aliphatic components, the most recalcitrant parts of these macromolecules. In so doing we wanted to investigate the relationship between HS structure and long-term management practices. An elevated content of lignin, aminoacids, peptides and proteins was observed mainly for farmyard manure treatments with respect to <b>mineral</b> or liquid <b>manure</b> amendments; this supports how the different management practices have greatly influenced the humification process of cultivated soils...|$|R
40|$|The paper analyzes, {{based on}} a land {{classification}} system, the optimal management of negative production externalities while {{taking into account the}} intertemporal and spatial aspects of the problem. To incorporate both aspects simultaneously, a two-stage modeling approach is proposed where the solution of the spatial problem (first stage) is optimized over time (second stage). As a result, it is possible to relate long-run and short-run supply and input demand functions. Attention is given to runoffs from agricultural land leading to the contamination of a water body, in particular, the one of phosphorus and the eutrophication of lakes. The employment of a land classification system supports a full-information approach and allows to address the optimal management of <b>mineral</b> fertilizer and <b>manure</b> based on zonal taxes, zonal permits, and zonal standards which all vary over time...|$|R
40|$|A {{field trial}} at the Institute of Forage Crops, Pleven, Bulgaria (2000 - 2003) was {{conducted}} to study the effect of mineral and organic fertilization on seed yield of alfalfa, root biomass accumulation and soil humus content. Alfalfa variety 'Victoria' was grown on a leached chernozem soil without irrigation. Rates of 70, 140 and 210 kg ha- 1 mineral nitrogen (active ingredient) were tested as ammonium nitrate and well-matured cattle manure. It was found that <b>mineral</b> and <b>manure</b> fertilization at 140 and 210 kg ha- 1 increased seed yield by 9. 9 % and 20. 9 % for mineral, and by 30. 3 % and 40. 6 % for manure. Seed yield was more stable under manure fertilization compared with mineral fertilization. Alfalfa accumulated between 2669 and 3098 kg ha- 1 dry root mass after mineral fertilization and between 3310 and 3570 kg ha- 1 after manure application. Additional root mass of 482 to 698 kg ha- 1 {{was found to be}} accumulated for manure treatments compared to mineral fertilization. High ratios of nitrogen yields (192 - 216 kg ha- 1) and plant available nitrogen (77 - 86 kg ha- 1) have been obtained from the treatments with manure. The highest amount of humus remained in the soil after fertilization of alfalfa with manure at the rate of 210 kg ha- 1...|$|R
40|$|Mining of {{nutrients}} from soil {{is a major}} problem causing soil degradation and threatening long-term food production in developing countries. In present research, an attempt was made for carrying out nutrient budgeting, which includes the calculation of nutrient balance at micro (plot / field) and meso (farm) level and evaluation of trends in nutrient mining / enrichment. A nutrient budget is an account of inputs and outputs {{of nutrients}} in an agricultural system. NUTrient MONitoring (NUTMON) is a multiscale approach that assess the stocks and flows of N, P and K in an well defined geographical unit based on the inputs viz., <b>mineral</b> fertilizers, <b>manures,</b> atmospheric deposition and sedimentation and outputs of harvested crop produces, residues, leaching, denitrification and erosion losses. The nutrient budgeting research in an irrigated farm at Coimbatore district revealed that the nutrient management practices are not appropriate and sustainable. Soil nutrient pool has to offset the negative balance of N and K, hence there is an expected mining of nutrient from the soil reserve in the research area. The management options / policy interventions to mitigate this mining by manipulating all inputs and outputs in a judicious way with an integrated system approach are suggested and one of the ways for redefining the fertilizer recommendation based on site specific using DSSIFER (Decision Support System for Integrated Fertilizer Recommendation) was worked out...|$|R

Statistical agricultural data from the Farm Structure Survey (FSS) were linked to the spatial information of the CORINE Land Cover 2000 map, producing a European map (EU 15) of land use including the crop spatial distribution, consistent with the official crops areas reported by FSS. Nitrogen and phosphorus inputs on soils originating from agriculture were estimated for EU 15, and then spatialised based on the land use map, providing European maps of nitrogen and phosphorus <b>mineral</b> fertiliser input, <b>manure</b> application and gross balance at 10 km 2 resolution. These maps allow the assessment of nutrient pressures originating from agriculture and constitute a reliable data layer for risk analysis and for process-based models, addressing water and soil qualityJRC.
