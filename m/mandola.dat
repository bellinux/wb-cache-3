25|$|The mandore {{was not a}} final form, and {{the design}} was tinkered with {{wherever}} it was built.

25|$|As a child actor, Irvine honed his {{performing}} talent from {{an early}} age and learned the classical guitar. He switched to folk music after discovering Woody Guthrie, also adopting the latter’s other instruments: harmonica and mandolin. While extending Guthrie’s guitar picking technique to the mandolin, he further developed his playing of this instrumentand, later, of the <b>mandola</b> and the bouzoukiinto a decorative, harmonic style and embraced the modes and rhythms of Bulgarian folk music. Along with Johnny Moynihan and Dónal Lunny, Irvine is one of the pioneers who adapted the Greek bouzoukiwith a new tuninginto an Irish instrument.

50|$|The {{history of}} modern mandolins, <b>mandolas</b> and guitars are all intertwined. The {{instruments}} shared common ancestor instruments.

25|$|The Algerian mandole was {{developed}} by an Italian luthier in the early 1930s, scaled up from a <b>mandola</b> until it reached a scale length of approximately 25-27 inches.

500|$|In 2013, Bhardwaj {{directed}} Matru Ki Bijlee Ka <b>Mandola,</b> {{a political}} satire {{set in the}} rustic surroundings of a village in Haryana.

500|$|The band stated at {{the time}} that it wanted to {{experiment}} with other sounds, which included Shepherd and Cornell playing mandolin and <b>mandola</b> in the song [...] "Ty Cobb". This experimentation can be heard to a lesser degree on Superunknown. Soundgarden used alternative tunings and odd time signatures on several of the album's songs. For example, [...] "Never the Machine Forever" [...] uses a time signature of 9/8. [...] "Pretty Noose" [...] and [...] "Burden in My Hand" [...] were written in C-G-C-G-G-E tuning.|$|E
500|$|Sharma then {{appeared}} in Vishal Bhardwaj's Matru Ki Bijlee Ka <b>Mandola</b> (2013), a political satire {{set in a}} village in Haryana.

The film received positive to mixed reviews from critics, and underperformed at the box office. Several critics noted that Sharma was being stereotyped as a loud and loquacious girl; Raja Sen noted that she [...] "is great {{in a couple of}} scenes near the climax," [...] though Kanika Sikka of Daily News and Analysis was more critical and found her [...] "unconvincing". The following year, she portrayed Jagat [...] "Jaggu" [...] Janini, a television journalist who befriends an alien (played by Aamir Khan), in Rajkumar Hirani's religious satire PK. Critic Saibal Chatterjee wrote that Sharma plays [...] "a feisty poetry-loving girl who knows her mind far more than most Hindi film heroines are allowed to" [...] and praised her for [...] "hold her own" [...] against Khan.

25|$|Not {{limited to}} mandolins, the Vinaccias made {{stringed}} instruments, including violins, cellos, guitars, <b>mandolas</b> and mandolins.

The mandolins they made changed over generations, from mandolinos with flat soundboards and gut-strings, through mandolins with a bent soundboard and bronze or bronze-and-gut strings, into mandolins with bent soundboards that used steel or steel-and-bronze strings.|$|R
