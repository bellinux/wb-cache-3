5|$|Cockroaches have {{incomplete}} metamorphosis, {{meaning that}} the nymphs are generally similar to the adults, except for undeveloped wings and genitalia. Development is generally slow, and <b>may</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> few months to over a year. The adults are also long-lived, and have survived {{for as much as}} four years in the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Hypothyroidism {{is managed}} with {{replacement}} of the hormone thyroxine. This is usually given daily as an oral supplement, and <b>may</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> few weeks to become effective. Some causes of hypothyroidism, such as Postpartum thyroiditis and Subacute thyroiditis may be transient and pass over time, and other causes such as iodine deficiency {{may be able to}} be rectified with dietary supplementation.|$|E
5|$|Iloilo International Airport is {{accessible}} via jeepney to Santa Barbara town proper, after which travelers <b>may</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> share taxi to the airport. Travelers may also take jeepneys {{en route to}} Cabatuan, Calinog or Janiuay, all of which stop at Santa Barbara.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the food}} is in the {{digestive}} cavity, gland cells in the gastroderm release enzymes that reduce the prey to slurry, usually within a few hours. This circulates through the digestive cavity and, in colonial cnidarians, through the connecting tunnels, so that gastroderm cells can absorb the nutrients. Absorption <b>may</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> few hours, and digestion within the cells <b>may</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> few days. The circulation of nutrients is driven by water currents produced by cilia in the gastroderm or by muscular movements or both, so that nutrients reach {{all parts of the}} digestive cavity. Nutrients reach the outer cell layer by diffusion or, for animals or zooids such as medusae which have thick mesogleas, are transported by mobile cells in the mesoglea.|$|E
5|$|An {{extraterrestrial}} civilization {{may choose}} to communicate with humanity by means of artifacts or probes rather than by radio, for various reasons. While probes <b>may</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> long time to reach the Solar System, once there {{they would be able}} to hold a sustained dialogue that would be impossible using radio from hundreds or thousands of light-years away. Radio would be completely unsuitable for surveillance and continued monitoring of a civilization, and should an extraterrestrial civilization wish to perform these activities on humanity, artifacts may be the only option other than to send large, crewed spacecraft to the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Constructing {{composite}} bows requires {{much more}} time and {{a greater variety of}} materials than self bows, and the animal glue used can lose strength in humid conditions; the 6th-century Byzantine military manual, the Strategikon, advised the cavalry of the Byzantine army, many of whom were armed with composite bows, to keep their bows in leather cases to keep them dry. Karpowicz suggests that crafting a composite bow <b>may</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> week's work, excluding drying time (months) and gathering materials, while a self bow can be made in a day and dried in a week. Peoples living in humid or rainy regions historically have favoured self-bows, while those living in dry or arid regions have favoured composite bows.|$|E

5|$|Deaths usually occur from {{respiratory}} failure or ventricular fibrillation secondary to ongoing seizure activity; fatalities have occurred {{within a few}} hours of ingestion. Poisoned people who recover usually regain consciousness and seizures cease within 24 to 48hours of poisoning, although seizures may persist for up to 96 hours. There are occasional long-term effects such as retrograde amnesia of the events leading to intoxication and the intoxication itself. Other ongoing mild effects may include restlessness, muscle weakness, twitching, and anxiety. Complete resolution of symptoms <b>may</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> number of days or, in some cases, these ongoing symptoms may persist for months after poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Once an {{alternate}} boot partition has been created, the TPM module {{needs to be}} initialized (assuming that this feature is being used), after which the required disk encryption key protection mechanisms such as TPM, PIN or USB key are configured. The volume is then encrypted as a background task, something that <b>may</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> considerable amount of time with a large disk as every logical sector is read, encrypted and rewritten back to disk. The keys are only protected after the whole volume has been encrypted, when the volume is considered secure. BitLocker uses a low-level device driver to encrypt and decrypt all file operations, making interaction with the encrypted volume transparent to applications running on the platform.|$|E
5|$|Verbs are a {{class of}} word in Wagiman which {{contains}} fewer than 50 members. As it is a closed class, no more verbs are possible. They are often monosyllabic verb roots and all are vowel-final. Wagiman verbs obligatorily inflect for person and number of core arguments, and for the tense and aspect of the clause. A small set of verbs <b>may</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> non-finite suffix -yh, in which {{it may not be}} further inflected for person or tense. That non-finite verb must then co-occur with another auxiliary verb.|$|E
50|$|Comanche nouns are inflected for {{case and}} number, and the {{language}} possesses a dual number. Like many Uto-Aztecan languages, nouns <b>may</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> absolutive suffix. Many cases are also marked using postpositions.|$|R

5|$|In {{people with}} stable OHS, the most {{important}} treatment is weight loss—by diet, through exercise, with medication, or sometimes weight loss surgery (bariatric surgery). This {{has been shown to}} improve the symptoms of OHS and resolution of the high carbon dioxide levels. Weight loss <b>may</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> long time and is not always successful. Bariatric surgery is avoided if possible, given the high rate of complications, but may be considered if other treatment modalities are ineffective in improving oxygen levels and symptoms. If the symptoms are significant, nighttime positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment is tried; this involves the use of a machine to assist with breathing. PAP exists in various forms, and the ideal strategy is uncertain. Some medications have been tried to stimulate breathing or correct underlying abnormalities; their benefit is again uncertain.|$|E
5|$|When {{they arise}} in the spring, the females go to nursery colonies which may often be the same place where they were born. These nursery colonies consist mainly of adult females and their young and can {{be located in the}} attics of warm {{buildings}} where there is high humidity. These colonies sometimes reach numbers of bats as great as 1,000 per cave/forest. Gestation lasts 50–60 days. They usually have one baby per female each year, sometimes twins, born sometime from late May to early July. The young are born in an altricial state with their eyes closed and will hang in the nursery while their mothers forage at night. Their eyes open on their second day. They cling to a nipple constantly until they are two weeks old. At three weeks, they learn to fly. By four weeks, they are adult sized. Females may be sexually mature in the fall after their birth, but males <b>may</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> year longer. About half of females and most males breed during their first autumn.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of this class {{is adapted from}} simple consonant stem nouns. Masculine and feminine genders share the same forms, and the neuter <b>may</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> strengthened plural form by analogy, or sometimes not use it. The oblique cases are {{the same for all}} genders.|$|E
25|$|In Georgian, {{there are}} two {{strategies}} for forming relative clauses. The first {{is similar to that}} of English or Latin: the modified noun is followed by a relativizer that inflects for its embedded case and <b>may</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> postposition. The relativized noun may be preceded by a determiner.|$|E

25|$|Place lone pairs. Each oxygen must be {{bonded to}} the nitrogen, which uses four electrons—two in each bond. The 14 {{remaining}} electrons should initially be placed as 7 lone pairs.

25|$|The {{exercise}} of ownership over property <b>may</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> number of forms. All {{that is required}} is that the defendant exercise control over the chattel in a manner inconsistent with the plaintiff's right of possession.
