Lyrically, [...] "I Did It, Mama!" [...] is about the [...] "conflict between different generations, more specific between children and their parents". Throughout the lyrics, Stan urges her parents to accept her misunderstood new boyfriend. However, with the refrain of the song, she stands her ground, repeating the track's title several times. Bradely Stern, writing for music website Pop Crush, compared {{the message of the}} song to that of Madonna's [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] (1986), while Stan herself confessed that [...] " [...] is a more rebellious recording that parents <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> from the first play".

500|$|In September 2014, {{talking about}} whether {{the ending of the}} season would also be a {{satisfying}} end to the series, Bell said [...] "we're not thinking of it as a series finale as much as a season finale ... I think we have some momentum coming in [...] and I think we pick up on it. I'm optimistic that we can keep the plane in the air a little longer." [...] He also talked {{about whether the}} themes of family and connectedness from the first season would be re-explored in the second, saying [...] "What we always look for are the human elements in the big story. That's what television does well, it makes you care about people, and whether it's literal family or anytime you have a team of people working together, it takes on some sort of family metaphor." [...] Bell reiterated the idea of family following the end of the season, saying [...] "In many ways, the whole metaphor {{at the heart of the}} show is family—you've got Coulson and May and then a bunch of younger people, and it allows us to play out different dynamics; literally, this season, we had Skye's biological parents versus her surrogate parents. And at the same time, we had Skye growing up. We had her going from a slightly sulky hacker season one to training to become an agent to becoming our first full-fledged superhero and so as we grow up, we separate from our parents... In our minds, her mom wasn't a villain so much; she was an antagonist, but if you look at why she feels the way she does, Jiaying really earned that position." [...] Discussing the reveal that Skye is actually Daisy Johnson, Maurissa Tancharoen explained thatJohnson is a character that we always liked. We always knew there was a potential to evolve Skye into something else. It took a little bit of time, but we were happy when we were able to land on Daisy Johnson, and actually have that work in our mythology. But as with everything that we do on the show, we pull from the properties, and we do our own spin to it. So we are kind of merging a few concepts and storylines. We've spent a season and a half with Skye. We've seen her evolve as a person, we've grown to like her as a person, we've seen her evolve as an agent. And now, finally bringing her to her origin story—I think there's just a lot more emotional weight to it, because you already know her as just Skye, and now she will have this ability that she <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand,</b> that she may not want ... We're going to focus on Skye, and how that affects the people around her, and how the relationships may shift. Because we've seen through the course of our series so far; we've spoken about how S.H.I.E.L.D. treats gifteds or views them, and they're categorized, things like that. What does that mean when one of your own is now considered someone with an ability? How do you categorize her?Whedon elaborated that [...] "We're going to walk her through the steps of discovering what this really means, and coming to terms with it. All that stuff is really interesting to us, and in television, because we have time to explore, we can take her origin on all sorts of different paths." [...] Additionally, Whedon talked about how the character would be referred to on the show after the reveal, saying, [...] "She's still Skye, because she thinks she's Skye. I think her dad thinks she's Daisy, and we'll see if she ever gets to the point where she believes that that's something that she would want to call herself. But right now, she has her own identity." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the United Kingdom, the {{creation}} of structural functionalism was anticipated by Raymond Firth's (1901–2002) We the Tikopia, published in 1936, and marked by the publication of African Political Systems, edited by Meyer Fortes (1906–1983) and E.E. Evans-Pritchard (1902–1973) in 1940. [...] In these works these anthropologists forwarded a synthesis of the ideas of their mentor, Bronisław Malinowski (1884–1942), and his rival, A. R. Radcliffe-Brown (1881–1955). [...] Both Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown viewed anthropology—what they call [...] "social anthropology"—as that branch of sociology that studied so-called primitive societies. [...] According to Malinowski's theory of functionalism, all human beings have certain biological needs, such {{as the need for}} food and shelter, and humankind has the biological need to reproduce. [...] Every society develops its own institutions, which function to fulfill these needs. [...] In order for these institutions to function, individuals take on particular social roles that regulate how they act and interact. [...] Although members of any given society <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>understand</b> the ultimate functions of their roles and institutions, an ethnographer can develop a model of these functions through the careful observation of social life. [...] Radcliffe-Brown rejected Malinowski's notion of function, and believed that a general theory of primitive social life could only be built up through the careful comparison of different societies. [...] Influenced by the work of French sociologist Émile Durkheim (1858–1917), who argued that primitive and modern societies are distinguished by distinct social structures, Radcliffe-Brown argued that anthropologists first had to map out the social structure of any given society before comparing the structures of different societies. [...] Firth, Fortes, and Evans-Pritchard found it easy to combine Malinowski's attention to social roles and institutions with Radcliffe-Brown's concern with social structures. [...] They distinguished between [...] "social organization" [...] (observable social interactions) and [...] "social structure" [...] (rule-governed patterns of social interaction), and shifted their attention from biological functions to social functions. For example, how different institutions are functionally integrated, and the extent to, and ways in, which institutions function to promote social solidarity and stability. [...] In short, instead of culture (understood as all human non-genetic or extra-somatic phenomena) they made [...] "sociality" [...] (interactions and relationships among persons and groups of people) their object of study. [...] (Indeed, Radcliffe-Brown once wrote [...] "I should like to invoke a taboo on the word culture.") ...|$|E
