50|$|The crew {{required}} {{to operate a}} large or super-sized luxury yacht can number from 8 members for a 120 ft yacht, to a complement of 70 for a yacht the size of Eclipse. The crew {{is made up of}} a Captain, First Mate/Officer, Chief Engineer, Engineers, Bosun, Personal Chef, Crew Chef, Deckhands and Stewardess/Stewards. Luxury yachts are maintained by crew all year round but will often scale down to a skeleton crew during the seasons that the owners are not on board and no charters are booked. Most crew members live on board and are paid a monthly salary, with most living expenses covered by the owner. Live-on-board crews do not pay rent, food, electricity or water bills. All luxury yachts have crew areas below deck, which consist of a crew <b>mess,</b> crew cabins <b>and</b> <b>laundry.</b> While most crew cabins contain bunk beds, there are Captains and Chief Engineers who, on the larger yachts, have their own cabins. There are no set hours that crew members work each week. The hours depend greatly on how often the owners are on board, how often it is chartered and on what hours the Captain sets when there are no guests on board. The crew can be hired through crew agencies or websites like Find a Crew.|$|R
