Starting a month {{prior to the}} UAVSAR collections, visual {{observations}} confirmed oil impacts along shorelines within northeastern Barataria Bay waters in eastern coastal Louisiana. UAVSAR data along several flight lines over Barataria Bay were collected on 23 June 2010, including the repeat flight line for which data were collected in June 2009. Our analysis of calibrated single-look complex data for these flight lines shows that structural damage of shoreline marsh accompanied by oil occurrence manifested as anomalous features not evident in pre-spill data. Freeman-Durden (FD) and Cloude-Pottier (CP) decompositions of the polarimetric data and Wishart classifications seeded with the FD and CP classes also highlighted these nearshore features as a change in dominant scattering mechanism.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new image}} formation method for <b>multi-polarization</b> through-the-wall <b>radar</b> imaging. The proposed method combines wall clutter mitigation and scene reconstruction in a unified framework using multitask Bayesian compressed sensing. First, the radar signals are jointly recovered using Bayesian compressed sensing in the wavelet domain. Then, a subspace projection method is employed to mitigate the front wall reflections. This is followed by principal component analysis, {{which is used to}} compress the remaining wavelet coefficients and remove noise. A linear model is developed which relates the compressed wavelet coefficients directly to the image of the scene. For scene reconstruction, multitask Bayesian compressed sensing is further applied to simultaneously form the images associated with all polarimetric channels. Experimental results based on real radar data demonstrate that the proposed method improves image quality by enhancing target reflections and attenuating background clutter...|$|R

Experiments {{have been carried out}} using ASAR imagery from Envisat combined with nine bands of ASTER imagery from the NASA Terra satellite. An experimental test site in an agricultural area in the county of Lincolnshire, UK, has been used. The satellite imagery has been integrated using artificial neural networks which have been trained as predictors of the spatial distributions of yield per unit area in a variety of fields. Ground truth data in the form of yield maps from GPS-enabled combine harvesters have been used to train the neural networks and to evaluate accuracy. The results show that the combinations of ASTER and ASAR imagery can provide enhanced yield predictions with overall correlations of up to 0. 77 between predicted and actual yield patterns. The results also show that the use of dual polarization radar data alone is not sufficient to give reasonable yield predictions even in a multi-temporal mode. It has also been shown that varying the architectures of the neural networks with ensembles can improve the overall results...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} the calibration {{and analysis of}} multi-frequency, <b>multi-polarization</b> <b>radar</b> backscatter signatures over an agriculture test site in the Netherlands. The calibration procedure involved two stages: in the first stage, polarimetric and radiometric calibrations (ignoring noise) were carried out using square-base trihedral corner reflector signatures and some properties of the clutter background. In the second stage, a novel algorithm was used to estimate the noise level in the polarimetric data channels by using the measured signature of an idealized rough surface with Bragg scattering (the ocean in this case). This estimated noise level was then used to correct the measured backscatter signatures from the agriculture fields. We examine the significance of several key parameters extracted from the calibrated and noise-corrected backscatter signatures. The significance is assessed {{in terms of the}} ability to uniquely separate among classes from 13 different backscatter types selected from the test site data, including eleven different crops, one forest and one ocean area. Using the parameters with the highest separation for a given class, we use a hierarchical algorithm to classify the entire image. We find that many classes, including ocean, forest, potato, and beet, can be identified with high reliability, while the classes for which no single parameter exhibits sufficient separation have higher rates of misclassification. We expect that modified decision criteria involving simultaneous consideration of several parameters increase performance for these classes...|$|E
40|$|The {{utility of}} radar scatterometers for {{discrimination}} and characterization of natural vegetation was investigated. Backscatter measurements were acquired with airborne multi-frequency, <b>multi-polarization,</b> multi-angle <b>radar</b> scatterometers over a test site {{in a southern}} temperate forest. Separability between ground cover classes was studied using a two-class separability measure. Very good separability is achieved between most classes. Longer wavelength is useful in separating trees from non-tree classes, while shorter wavelength and cross polarization are helpful for discrimination among tree classes. Using the maximum likelihood classifier, 50 % overall classification accuracy is achieved using a single, short-wavelength scatterometer channel. Addition of multiple incidence angles and another radar band improves classification accuracy by 20 % and 50 %, respectively, over the single channel accuracy. Incorporation of a third radar band seems redundant for vegetation classification. Vertical transmit polarization is critically important for all classes...|$|R
40|$|The GaoFen- 3 (GF- 3) {{satellite}} is {{the first}} C-band <b>multi-polarization</b> synthetic aperture <b>radar</b> (SAR) imaging satellite with a resolution up to 1 m in China. It is also the only SAR satellite of the High-Resolution Earth Observation System designed for civilian use. There are 12 different imaging models {{to meet the needs}} of different industry users. However, to use SAR satellite images for related applications, they must possess high geometric accuracy. In order to verify the geometric accuracy achieved by the different modes of GF- 3 images, we analyze the SAR geometric error source and perform geometric correction tests based on the RPC model with and without ground control points (GCPs) for five imaging modes. These include the spotlight (SL), ultra-fine strip (UFS), Fine Strip I (FSI), Full polarized Strip I (QPSI), and standard strip (SS) modes. Experimental results show that the check point residuals are large and consistent without GCPs, but the root mean square error of the independent checkpoints for the case of four corner control points is better than 1. 5 pixels, achieving a similar level of geometric positioning accuracy to that of international satellites. We conclude that the GF- 3 satellite can be used for high-accuracy geometric processing and related industry applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} from rain to snow {{at the surface}} {{is one of the}} challenging facts in aviation and road traffic during winter weather condition. Even though numerical weather forecast is able to provide reasonable forecasts, nowcasting applications still suffer from the precise observation of the {{transition from}} rain to snow at the surface. The application of dual-polarization radar has shown that fuzzy logic allows classifying hydrometeors in distinct classes. However, some uncertainty exists in the distinction between light rainfall and light snowfall. The knowledge of temperature can help in this situation, but is often not available with the desired quality and for three-dimensional the region of interest. Further uncertainty is caused by the fact that radar does not measure at the surface but at several hundred meters above the surface. For an improved classification of surface precipitation we identify the height of the melting layer first. The height of the melting layer is then included in the fuzzy classification process. This allows a more reliable distinction between rain (below) and snow (above). In the presentation we will show results from this algorithm using the DLR <b>multi-polarization</b> C-band weather <b>radar</b> POLDIRAD including a verification using ground based observations at Munich airport (disdrometer and human METAR observations) as well as measurements with a vertical pointing Doppler micro rain radar...|$|R

The cross-polarization multi-temporal index enables precise volumetric surface soil moisture estimation and monitoring on boreal wetlands, regardless of the influence of vegetation cover and surface roughness conditions (bias was under 1 %, standard deviation and RMSE were under 10 % for almost all estimation errors). Surface soil moisture estimation was more precise over permanently flooded areas than seasonally flooded ones (standard deviation is systematically greater for the seasonally flooded areas, at all analyzed scales), although the overall quality of the estimation is still precise.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{reports the}} development of a new multi-band multi-output synthesizer, 1 / 2 dual-injection locked divider, 1 / 3 injection-locked divider with phase-tuning, and 1 / 3 injection-locked divider with self-injection using 0. 18 -micrometer CMOS technology. The synthesizer is used for a multi-band <b>multi-polarization</b> <b>radar</b> system operating in the K- and Ka-band. The synthesizer is a fully integrated concurrent tri-band, tri-output phase-locked loop (PLL) with divide-by- 3 injection locked frequency divider (ILFD). A new locking mechanism for the ILFD based on the gain control of the feedback amplifier is utilized to enable tunable and enhanced locking range which facilitates the attainment of stable locking states. The PLL has three concurrent multiband outputs: 3. 47 - 4. 313 GHz, 6. 94 - 8. 626 GHz and 19. 44 - 21. 42 -GHz. High second-order harmonic suppression of 62. 2 dBc is achieved without using a filter through optimization of the balance between the differential outputs. The proposed technique enables the use of an integer-N architecture for multi-band and microwave systems, while maintaining the benefit of the integer-N architecture; an optimal performance in area and power consumption. The 1 / 2 dual-ILFD with wide locking range and low-power consumption is analyzed and designed together with a divide-by- 2 current mode logic (CML) divider. The 1 / 2 dual-ILFD enhances the locking range with low-power consumption through optimized load quality factor (QL) and output current amplitude (iOSC) simultaneously. The 1 / 2 dual-ILFD achieves a locking range of 692 MHz between 7. 512 and 8. 204 GHz. The new 1 / 2 dual-ILFD is especially attractive for microwave phase-locked loops and frequency synthesizers requiring low power and wide locking range. The 3. 5 -GHz divide-by- 3 (1 / 3) ILFD consists of an internal 10. 5 -GHz Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) functioning as an injection source, 1 / 3 ILFD core, and output inverter buffer. A phase tuner implemented on an asymmetric inductor is proposed to increase the locking range. The other divide-by- 3 ILFD utilizes self-injection technique. The self-injection technique substantially enhances the locking range and phase noise, and reduces the minimum power of the injection signal needed for the 1 / 3 ILFD. The locking range is increased by 47. 8 % and the phase noise is reduced by 14. 77 dBc/Hz at 1 -MHz offset...|$|E
40|$|A multi-azimuth and <b>multi-polarization</b> ground {{penetrating}} <b>radar</b> (GPR) {{survey is}} carried out to help characterize a fractured fault zone located in Mason County, Texas. A total of 36 lines were acquired on and near the fault zone to try to identify the GPR signature of a complex fracture system. These lines were run through a standard set of processing steps to try to identify the fractures. The {{results showed that the}} multi-azimuth survey helped identify the dominant strike of the fractures, which was parallel to the strike of the fault (NE-SW). The multi-polarization survey helped identify the different fills of the fractures. Due to the orientation of the fractures, the PP orientation showed the resistive fractures while the TT orientation showed the conductive fractures. gprMax, a 2 -D finite-difference time-domain GPR simulation software, was used to confirm the results seen in the field data. Two 2 -D models were created to understand the GPR response of the different fracture fills in the TT orientation. The first model simulated 3 identical fractures with 3 different fracture fills (air, water, clay). Results of this model showed that in the TT orientation, the air filled fractures have the weakest response while the clay filled fractures have the strongest response. The second model simulated the dominant fractures seen in Line A, PP and TT orientations. The results again showed that in the TT orientation, conductive fractures have the strongest response while the resistive fractures have the weakest response, confirming the results from the field data. A geophysical workflow was proposed to help identify buried shallow faults in remote locations. This workflow will help enhance the field observations of an area. The workflow goes from surveying a large area (100 s of m) using aeromagnetic data to identifying fractures in a fault zone at cm scale by using GPR method shown in this research...|$|R

The primary objective is to develop an automatic and effective target detection algorithm, which is able to provide robust performance for an operational maritime surveillance system under various circumstances. There are two frequently encountered major detection issues in practice. Firstly, in multiple-target situations, the local reference sea clutter is often contaminated by interfering targets.

Secondly, in non-homogeneous environments, sea surface transitions between regions with different radar backscattering properties are usually observed in conjunction with various meteorological and oceanographic phenomena. The result is recognized as the clutter edge effect. Both effects inevitably lead to inaccurate parameter estimation and deceptive statistical modeling, thus causing severe degradation of the detection performance. In this study, the conventional constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector setup is adopted in the algorithm. The rigorous statistical analysis using truncated statistics (TS) provides improved background clutter modeling results, while a corresponding TS-based CFAR (TS-CFAR) detector is first proposed to suppress the capture effect and ameliorate detection performance.

40|$|Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) {{has been}} {{identified}} as a good candidate to provide high-resolution soil moisture information over extended areas. SAR data could be used as observations within a global Data Assimilation (DA) approach to benefit applications such as hydrology and agriculture. Prior to developing an operational DA system, one must tackle the following challenges of soil moisture estimation with SAR: (1) the dependency of the measured radar signal on both soil moisture and soil surface roughness which leads to an ill-conditioned inverse problem, and (2) the difficulty in characterizing spatially/temporally surface roughness of natural soils and its scattering contribution. The objectives of this project are (1) to develop a roughness measurement method to improve the spatial/temporal characterization of soil surface roughness, and (2) to investigate to what extent the inverse problem can be solved by combining multipolarization, multi-incidence, and/or multi-frequency radar measurements. The first objective is achieved with a measurement method based on Structure from Motion (SfM). It is tailored to monitor natural surface roughness changes which have often been assumed negligible although without evidence. The measurement method is flexible, a. ordable, straightforward and generates Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) for a SAR-pixel-size plot with mm accuracy. A new processing method based on band-filtering of the DEM and its 2 D Power Spectral Density (PSD) is proposed to compute the classical roughness parameters. Time series of DEMs show that non-negligible changes in surface roughness can happen within two months at scales relevant for microwave scattering. The second objective is achieved using maximum likelihood fitting of the Oh backscattering model to (1) full-polarimetric Radarsat- 2 data and (2) simulated multi-polarization / multi-incidence / multi-frequency radar data. Model fitting with the Radarsat- 2 images leads to poor soil moisture retrieval which is related to inaccuracy of the Oh model. Model fitting with the simulated data quantifies the amount of multilooking for di. erent combinations of measurements needed to mitigate the critical e. ect of speckle on soil moisture uncertainty. Results also suggest that dual-polarization measurements at L- and C-bands are a promising combination to achieve the observation requirements of soil moisture. In conclusion, the SfM method along with the recommended processing techniques are good candidates to improve the characterization of surface roughness. A combination of <b>multi-polarization</b> and multi-frequency <b>radar</b> measurements appears to be a robust basis for a future Data Assimilation system for global soil moisture monitoring...|$|R
