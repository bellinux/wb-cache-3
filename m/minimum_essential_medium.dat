40|$|Recent {{work from}} this {{laboratory}} (1, 2) {{has demonstrated that}} mouse resident peritoneal macrophages release the slow-reacting substance (SRS), 1 leukotriene C [5 (S) -hydroxy- 6 (R) -glutathionyl- 7, 9, 11, 14 -eicosatetraenoic acid; LTC] {{in response to a}} phagocytic stimulus. No data are as yet available concerning leukotriene synthesis by other mouse macrophage populations. It is of particular interest to know whether pulmonary macrophages are also able to produce large quantities of leukotrienes because of the sensitivity of the peripheral airways of the lung to SRS (3, 4). In this report, we present the results of studies of zymosan-induced leukotriene synthesis by mouse pulmonary alveolar macrophages, obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage and by pulmonary interstitial macrophages, isolated by enzymatic digestion of lung tissue. Materials and Methods Pulmonary Macrophage Cultures. Pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAM) and pulmonary tissue macrophages (PTM) were obtained from male and female ICR mice weighing 25 - 30 g (Trudeau Institute Inc., Saranac Lake, NY) by a modification of the method of Bluss ~ Van Oud Alblas and Van Furth (5). Each mouse was anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 5 mg of sodium pentobarbital (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL). The chest cavity was opened, and the aorta and inferior vena cava were cut. Blood was removed from the lungs by perfusion with calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mM EDTA, which was injected into the right ventricle of the heart until the lung tissue was uniformly white. The trachea was then cannulated, and the lungs were washed five times with 1 ml of buffered saline containing EDTA at 37 °C. These washes, which contained PAM, were combined and placed on ice. For culture, the cells were washed once with buffered saline and resuspended at a cell density of 1 × 106 /ml in <b>minimum</b> <b>essential</b> alpha <b>medium</b> (e~-MEM...|$|R
