25|$|Pakistan {{has been}} run by {{military}} dictatorships for large periods of time, alternating with limited democracy.

Development priorities are determined not by potential beneficiaries but by the bureaucracy and a political elite {{which may or may}} not be in touch with the needs of the citizens. Political instability and <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>imbalances</b> have been reflected in poor creditworthiness ratings, even compared to other countries of similar income levels, with resulting capital flight and lower foreign direct investment inflows. The current government of Pakistan has professed commitments to reforms in this area.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between labor market and employment {{on one hand and}} <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>imbalance</b> and its adjustment on the other. It argues that distortions and rigidities in the labor market can aggravate <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>imbalance</b> and create impediments in the way of their adjustment. It also argues that the initial system of economic incentives and institutions and the composition of adjustment policies determine what kind of impact adjustment has on employment. A comparison of the experience of a group of South Asian countries with that of a group of East and Southeast Asian countries provides useful insights into the kind of labor market policies and institutions that are most conducive to the avoidance of <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>imbalance</b> and to the rapid adjustment of the imbalances that occur. This comparison also helps identify guidelines for the design of employment-friendly adjustment...|$|R

40|$|Bilateral trade {{balances}} are {{an important}} cause for frictions in international trade relations. Therefore, recognizing their causes is essential. The paper presents an attempt to empirically verify theory {{that could be used}} for explaining Poland’s foreign trade imbalance. The main hypothesis combines the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>imbalance</b> with bilateral trade imbalance. The main assumption is that bilateral trade imbalances result from the aggregate trade imbalance. It is somehow natural for countries with permanent deficits in foreign trade to experience bilateral deficits in trade with countries experiencing permanent surpluses. For the studied case of Poland, this theory allows for forecasting trade balances on the basis of aggregate <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>imbalance.</b> Empirical study for the period from 1993 to 2006 shows that there are no reasons to reject the posed hypothesis. However, for forecasting bilateral trade balances the theory is insufficient due to significant asymmetry...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Macro{{economic}}</b> <b>Imbalance</b> Procedure {{seeks to}} prevent and correct destabilising economic imbalances in the European Union. Scholars are divided as to whether this instrument of economic policy coordination relies on the same intergovernmental modes of decision-making as the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines or reflects supranational institutions more significant role in EU economic policy following the euro crisis. Such diametrically opposed interpretations are symptomatic of longstanding concerns over {{the lack of a}} clear-cut definition of European integration. To address these definitional difficulties, this paper turns to the concept of legalisation. Taking account of the design and early implementation of the <b>Macroeconomic</b> <b>Imbalance</b> Procedure and using the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines as a point of comparison, it shows that the former can be understood as a modest but clear-cut increase in legalisation compared to the latter. On this basis, it considers whether legalisation, in spite of its own conceptual limitations, can contribute to a more rigorous definition of European integration...|$|R

5000|$|Strengthened {{implementation}} of the <b>Macroeconomic</b> <b>Imbalance</b> Procedure: (A) Its corrective arm (Excessive Imbalance Procedure) is currently only triggered if excessive imbalances are identified while the state subsequently also fails to deliver a National Reform Programme sufficiently addressing the found imbalances, and the reform implementation surveillance reports published for states with excessive imbalance but without EIP only work as a non-legal peer-pressure instrument. In the future, the EIP should be triggered as soon as excessive imbalances are identified, so that the Commission more forcefully within this legal framework can require {{implementation of}} structural reforms - followed by a period of extended reform implementation surveillance in which continued incompliance can be sanctioned. (B) The <b>Macroeconomic</b> <b>Imbalance</b> Procedure should also better capture imbalances (external deficits) for the eurozone as a whole - not just for each individual country, and also require implementation of reforms in countries accumulating large and sustained current account surpluses (if caused by insufficient domestic demand or low growth potential).|$|R

As Morris Goldstein (2004) puts it, this is nothing but the classic solution proposed by James Meade in 1951. Thus, in the view of these (mostly Western) observers the problem in China is her decision to peg the RMB to the dollar rather than letting it appreciate.

50|$|The {{macroeconomic}} situation {{suffered a}} major shock in 2003 with the banking crisis and subsequent bail {{out by the}} BCRD, which guaranteed all Baninter (one of the major banks that failed) deposits and providing liquidity to two other banks at a total cost to the budget equivalent to 21 percent of the GDP. The banking crisis led to a major capital flight, a sharp currency depreciation, high inflation and significant fiscal pressures (exacerbated by an ongoing electricity crisis), together creating large <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>imbalances</b> and an environment of uncertainty and perceived risk.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{capital flight}} {{from a group}} of seventeen developing nations over the period 1978 to 1993. The paper briefly discusses several empirical definitions of capital flight and presents estimates of capital flight for the sample based on some of these measures. In general, the data reveal periodic episodes of dramatic flight through the late 1980 s, at which point many nations began to experience strong capital inflows. Anecdotal evidence for the nations in our sample underpins our hypothesis that capital flight is driven by a heightened, pervasive risk which reflects the degree of domestic <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>imbalance</b> which is domestically undiversifiable. Our econometric model of the determinants of capital flight extends previous empirical studies of flight by expanding both the cross section of nations and time horizon of analysis. Given the panel data set, we consider a country specific error component to account for the possibility of unobserved country heterogeneity and employ fixed- effects and random-effects estimation. We instrument for potentially endogenous explanatory variables and in doing so consider a fixed-effects system. The results, based on several different measures of flight, highlight the importance of modelling flight with a country specific error component. While other proxies of the risk associated with <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>imbalance</b> are not significant, the central government surplus is negatively, statistically significantly related to flight. This highlights the motivation of investors to move capital both to escape future taxation directly and indirectly via monetization of deficits. Therefore, even when taking into account other measures of risk, the higher taxation risk, both directly and indirectly through expectations of future inflation, dominates the regressions.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to an ongoing debate in International Political Economy about {{the appropriateness of}} globalization, regionalization and <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>imbalance</b> theory by identifying quantitative estimates for all three tendencies from world trade data. This is achieved {{with a series of}} gravity models enhanced stepwise by the mapping of the estimation errors of a given model on representations of the overall structure of trade. This not only allows the identification of imperfections in a given model but also permits the further improvement of the models since any systematic regional organization in the error-terms can be identified. The results of the most elaborated model indicate that single factor explanations of global economic integration are presumably misleading. Instead, each of three explanations captures only part of the ongoing changes, as they can be identified under a comparative static perspective from world trade data. ...|$|R
