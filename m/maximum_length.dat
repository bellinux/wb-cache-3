5|$|Fibonacci {{search is}} a method similar to binary search that {{successively}} shortens the interval in which the maximum of a unimodal function lies. Given a finite interval, a unimodal function, and the <b>maximum</b> <b>length</b> of the resulting interval, Fibonacci search finds a Fibonacci number such that if the interval is divided equally into that many subintervals, the subintervals would be shorter than the <b>maximum</b> <b>length.</b> After dividing the interval, it eliminates the subintervals in which the maximum cannot lie until one or more contiguous subintervals remain.|$|E

5|$|The Corporation of Doncaster sought {{powers in}} 1727 {{to improve the}} river below Holmstile, as far as Wilsick House in Barnby Dun. The Bill passed through {{parliament}} uneventfully, and again included detailed restrictions on what could {{and could not be}} done, designed to protect the landowners. The details were very specific in that they included the permissible heights of dams, the <b>maximum</b> <b>length</b> of cuts, and many other details of the work to be carried out.|$|E
5|$|The maximum hair length that is {{possible}} to reach is about 15cm (6in) for infants (below the age of 1), about 60cm (24in) for children, and generally 100cm (40in) for adults. Documentation for decrease of the <b>maximum</b> <b>length</b> with age cannot {{be found in the}} literature. Some individuals can reach excessive lengths. Lengths greater than 150cm (59in) are frequently observed in long hair contests. Xie Qiuping had the longest documented hair in the world, measuring 5.627 m (18ft 5.54 in) in May 2004.|$|E
5|$|Although this {{decision}} was a boon to the Stationers, it was short-lived. Following Millar, the right to print The Seasons was sold to a coalition of publishers including Thomas Becket. Two Scottish printers, Alexander and John Donaldson, began publishing an unlicensed edition, and Becket successfully obtained an injunction to stop them. This decision was appealed in Donaldson v Beckett, and eventually went to the House of Lords. After consulting with the judges of the King's Bench, Common Pleas and Exchequer of Pleas, the Lords concluded that copyright was not perpetual, and that the term permitted by the Statute of Anne was the <b>maximum</b> <b>length</b> of legal protection for publishers and authors alike.|$|E

5|$|Some {{algorithms}} become simpler {{when used}} on DAGs instead of general graphs, {{based on the}} principle of topological ordering. For example, it is possible to find shortest paths and longest paths from a given starting vertex in DAGs in linear time by processing the vertices in a topological order, and calculating the path length for each vertex to be the minimum or <b>maximum</b> <b>length</b> obtained via any of its incoming edges. In contrast, for arbitrary graphs the shortest path may require slower algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm or the Bellman–Ford algorithm, and longest paths in arbitrary graphs are NP-hard to find.|$|E
5|$|The 11 snake species {{occurring}} in Puerto Rico are generally considered non-venomous, although research {{has concluded that}} at least one species, the Puerto Rican racer (Alsophis portoricensis), secretes venom. These species belong to 3 families and 4 genera: Typhlopidae (Typhlops genus), Boidae (Epicrates) and Colubridae (Alsophis and Arrhyton). The largest snake in Puerto Rico is the endemic Puerto Rican boa (Epicrates inornatus) with a <b>maximum</b> <b>length</b> of 12ft (3.7m). The diet of snakes in Puerto Rico consists of reptiles (Ameiva, Anolis, geckos), coquís and other frogs, and, to a lesser extent, mice, birds and bats (exclusively by the Puerto Rican Boa).|$|E
5|$|The finetooth shark (Carcharhinus isodon) is {{a species}} of requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae, found in the western Atlantic Ocean, from North Carolina to Brazil. It forms large schools in shallow, coastal waters, and migrates {{seasonally}} following warm water. A relatively small, slender-bodied shark, the finetooth shark can be identified by its needle-like teeth, dark blue-gray dorsal coloration, and long gill slits. It attains a <b>maximum</b> <b>length</b> of 1.9m (6.2ft). The diet of this species consists primarily of small bony fishes, in particular menhaden. Like other members of its family, it is viviparous with females giving birth to two to six pups in estuarine nursery areas every other year.|$|E

5|$|Today, {{the blue}} whale is renowned {{for being the}} largest animal ever to have lived. In part because of its legendary status, many misconceptions still exist. For example, its size is often exaggerated. Many popular sources give the <b>maximum</b> <b>length</b> as 110 feet (33.5 meters) or more. While such lengths were {{reported}} in the whaling records, they were not scientifically verified and were probably exaggerated. Virtually all books and articles that mention the blue whale claim that it can reach 100 feet (30.5 meters). This is probably true (the largest verified specimen was 29.9 meters, 98 feet) but is highly misleading as the average size is much smaller.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the athlete}} has taken flight, {{characteristics}} {{similar to that}} of a glider come into force. Ski flyers are able to cover such tremendous distances and land safely primarily due to the skis they use, which are substantially wider and longer than their cross-country or Alpine skiing counterparts. Each ski is first attached securely {{at the front of the}} boot, which has an exaggerated forward slant; the heel is then attached to a wedge on the ski using a hinged binding peg or strap with a <b>maximum</b> <b>length</b> of , allowing the athlete to lean forward into their preferred aerodynamic position and spread the skis wide apart. Much like aircraft wings, the skis are flexible to an extent, resulting in them bending and vibrating significantly upon takeoff. Maintaining stability in the air is paramount: a loss of balance, or a differential pressure under the skis, can lead to disaster (see list of ski flying accidents). A few athletes have a natural tendency to drift over to one side of the hill, invariably shortening their jump distance.|$|E
5|$|Gorgon Eyes and Phoenix Feathers, found {{throughout}} the game in unmarked chests (white chests in Ascension), increase {{the maximum amount of}} health and magic, respectively. Minotaur Horns, which increase the Items and Fire meter's <b>maximum</b> <b>length,</b> are available in God of War III and Ghost of Sparta, respectively. The Items meter allows the use of secondary weapons, called Items, and the Fire meter allows the use of Thera's Bane. The meters are increased in increments and reach their maximum once a certain number of Eyes, Feathers, and Horns are found. Other chests contain green, blue, or red orbs. Green orbs replenish the player's health, blue orbs replenish magic allowing further usage, and red orbs provide experience for upgrading weapons and magic for new, more powerful attacks, and replenish the Rage meter in God of War. Gold orbs found in God of War II and Ascension, and white orbs in God of War III, replenish the Rage meter instead of red orbs; the Rage meter in Ascension is also refilled by landing attacks on foes. Chests with changing colors, which allow players to choose which meter to replenish, have also been available. Red orbs can also be collected by killing foes and destroying certain inanimate objects. Bosses and more powerful opponents release a combination of colored orbs when killed via the quick-time feature.|$|E

25|$|The {{subtribe}} Pronophilina can {{be separated}} from other American satyrines by the following three external morphological synapomorphies: eyes always densely hairy; hindwing cross vein m1-m2 always curved or angled basally into the discal cell; <b>maximum</b> <b>length</b> of hindwing discal cell equal to or longer than half the total <b>maximum</b> <b>length</b> of the hindwing (excluding tails).

40|$|BACKGROUND: falling is a {{major health}} problem. OBJECTIVE: to {{investigate}} the predictive value for falls of the <b>maximum</b> step <b>length</b> and gait speed. DESIGN: a prospective cohort study. SETTING: geriatric outpatient clinic. SUBJECTS: three hundred and fifty-two community-dwelling older persons screened by their general practitioner. METHODS: <b>maximum</b> step <b>length</b> and gait speed were recorded {{as part of a}} comprehensive geriatric assessment. One-year follow-up was performed using the fall telephone system. RESULTS: one hundred and thirty-six (39 %) of all subjects (mean age: 76. 2 years, standard deviation: 4. 3, 55 % female), fell at least once, of whom 96 were injured. Predictive values for any falls of both <b>maximum</b> step <b>length</b> and gait speed were low (area under the curve (AUC) : 0. 53 and 0. 50) and slightly better for recurrent falls (<b>maximum</b> step <b>length</b> AUC: 0. 64 and gait speed AUC: 0. 59). After adding age, gender and fall history to the prediction model, the AUC was 0. 63 for <b>maximum</b> step <b>length</b> and 0. 64 for gait speed, and for recurrent falls, the AUC was 0. 69 both for <b>maximum</b> step <b>length</b> and gait speed. The prediction of fall-related injuries showed similar results. A higher <b>maximum</b> step <b>length</b> score indicated a lower likelihood for falls (hazards ratio 0. 36; 95 % confidence interval 0. 17 - 0. 78). CONCLUSIONS: <b>maximum</b> step <b>length</b> and gait speed as single-item tools do not have sufficient power to predict future falls in community-dwelling older persons...|$|R
