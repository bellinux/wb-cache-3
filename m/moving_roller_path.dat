40|$|Sheet metal {{spinning}} {{is one of}} the metal forming processes, where a flat metal blank is rotated at a high speed and formed into an axisymmetric part by a roller which gradually forces the blank onto a mandrel, bearing the final shape of the spun part. Over the last few decades, sheet {{metal spinning}} has developed significantly and spun products have been widely used in various industries. Although the spinning process has already been known for centuries, the process design still highly relies on experienced spinners using trial-and-error. Challenges remain to achieve high product dimensional accuracy and prevent material failures. This PhD project aims to gain insight into the material deformation and wrinkling failure mechanics in the conventional spinning process by employing experimental and numerical methods. In this study, a tool compensation technique has been proposed and used to develop CNC multiple <b>roller</b> <b>path</b> (passes). 3 -D elastic-plastic Finite Element (FE) models have been developed to analyse the material deformation and wrinkling failure of the spinning process. By combining these two techniques in the process design, the time and materials wasted by using the trial-and-error could be decreased significantly. In addition, it may provide a practical approach of standardised operation for the spinning industry and thus improve the product quality, process repeatability and production efficiency. Furthermore, effects of process parameters, e. g. <b>roller</b> <b>path</b> profiles, feed rate and spindle speed, on the variations of tool forces, stresses, strains, wall thickness and wrinkling failures have also been investigated. Using a concave <b>roller</b> <b>path</b> produces high tool forces, stresses and reduction of wall thickness. Conversely, low tool forces, stresses and wall thinning have been obtained in the FE model which uses the convex <b>roller</b> <b>path.</b> High feed ratios help to maintain original blank thickness but also lead to material failures and rough surface finish. Thus it is necessary to find a “trade off” feed ratio for a spinning process design...|$|R

There are some important issues in the numerical analysis method of R 2 R system. This study proposes an efficient R 2 R system analysis method. The first one is the Approximated Winding Length Estimation (AWLE) algorithm which can calculate the analytic winded length of the workpiece. The core winder is approximated with line and arc segments in this algorithm. As a result, in the numerical model of R 2 R system, we can replace the winder characteristics with the approximated winding length estimation (AWLE) algorithm.

50|$|Flow Forming is an {{incremental}} metal forming technique {{in which a}} disk or tube of metal is formed over a mandrel {{by one or more}} rollers using tremendous pressure. The roller deforms the workpiece, forcing it against the mandrel, both axially lengthening and radially thinning it. Since the pressure exerted by the roller is highly localized and the material is incrementally formed, often there is a net savings in energy in forming over drawing or ironing processes. However, these savings are often not realized because of the inherent difficulties in predicting the resulting deformation for a given <b>roller</b> <b>path.</b> Flow forming subjects the workpiece to a great deal of friction and deformation. These two factors may heat the workpiece to several hundred degrees if proper cooling fluid is not utilized.|$|R

The remainder of the bridge foundations consisted of cast iron piers fitted with cutting shoes sunk by excavation by hand labour working in airlocks, and by weighting. Piers for the swing span consisted of eight cast iron cylinders tapering from 6 to 4.5 ft diameter from base to top which surrounded a ninth cylinder of 7 ft base diameter; the [...] wall width cylinders were sunk {{to the level of}} sandstone bedrock at a depth of around 78 ft; after which they were filled with concrete. The central river pier had similar foundations of two 8 ft cast iron piers braced together. The swing span turntable consisted of 29 ft diameter steel conical <b>roller</b> <b>paths</b> and bearings, supported on a circular 20 in deep box girder in eight sections, with a twelve section box girder above, supporting the superstructure. The bridge turned about a central heavy cast pivot, with ties to the upper and lower box girders, and to the bearings. The bridge superstructure was constructed of wrought iron plate girders, with an asymmetric 'hogback' shape; the swing span extremities were 45 and 85 ft from the centre line, with a 92.45 LT counterweight; the maximum web depth was 14.5 ft. The fixed span was of similar, but symmetrical construction. The bridge was turned by the reaction of a rotating vertical shaft on a rack on the lower <b>roller</b> <b>path.</b> Power was supplied hydraulically from an accumulator (charged by steam engine power) near the railway station, via underground concentric pressure and return pipes in the central swing span pier - driving a pair of three cylinder hydraulic engines located in the cabin. Accumulators and steam engines were duplicated. The locking mechanism for the bridge was also hydraulically powered. As a consequence of the realignment of track resulting from the resiting of the bridge the station at Selby was also partially reconstructed.|$|R

30|$|As {{a special}} type of {{conventional}} spinning process, DRCS should be studied to reveal its deformation mechanism. Thus, the authors used two methods to establish FE model of DRCS for a cylinder with a rectangular flange. The first method {{is the same}} as that for actual working conditions, where the workpiece rotates around its own axis. The second method makes the workpiece motionless, unlike in the actual forming process. Different methods may be chosen according to the different computing conditions [26]. To save computing time, the authors used the second method to establish an FE model of the DRCS, and solved key problems in establishing the model, such as the expression of the complex <b>roller</b> <b>path,</b> meshing, the clamping position for the internal expanding clamp, and the location of the bending point. Then, a precise three-dimensional elasticoplastic FE model was established for DRCS, and the FE model was verified by experiments [27]. Moreover, the authors carried out experimental research and many FE simulations and obtained the effects of main process parameters, such as the roller radius, the spacing between two rollers and the feed rate of rollers on the DRCS process [28].|$|R
40|$|The {{kinematics}} of {{the deep}} rolling tool, contact stress, and induced residual stress in the near-surface material of a flat Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy plate are numerically investigated. The deep rolling tool is under multiaxis nonlinear motion in the process. Unlike available deep rolling simulations in the open literature, the roller motion investigated in this study includes penetrative and slightly translational motions. A three-dimensional finite element model with dynamic explicit technique is developed to simulate the instantaneous complex roller motions during the deep rolling process. The initial motion of the rollers followed by the penetration motion to apply the load and perform the deep rolling process, the load releasing, and material recovery steps is sequentially simulated. This model is able to capture the transient characteristics of the kinematics on the roller and contacts between the roller and the plate due to variations of roller motion. The predictions show that the magnitude of roller reaction force in the penetration direction starts to decrease with time when the roller motion changes to the deep rolling step and the residual stress distributions in the near-surface material after the material recovery step varies considerably along the <b>roller</b> <b>path...</b>|$|R

30|$|Conventional {{spinning}} is a single-roller spinning process. Because {{only one}} roller is used, {{one side of}} the sheet metal bears severe asymmetrical spinning force, which can easily cause wrinkling. And point contact between the single roller and sheet metal causes very small plastic deformation after each spinning pass, which leads to more spinning passes and low production efficiency. Furthermore, conventional single-roller spinning requires the use of different sizes of rollers for different materials, shapes, and sizes of spun parts. These rollers have complex surface profiles, terrible stress conditions, low life cycled, and high manufacturing costs. In contrast, the new DRCS process uses two cylinder rollers with simple shapes and low costs to symmetrically clamp the sheet metal which bears compressive stress. Because there is sufficient pressure in the thickness direction, {{it is not easy to}} cause sheet wrinkling, and the spun parts have high dimensional accuracy. In contrast with conventional spinning, the DRCS process involves line contact between the rollers and sheet metal. Thus, the loading action area is larger than that in conventional spinning, and the plastic deformation in each spinning pass is larger. Consequently spinning efficiency is higher. In addition, in the DRCS process, the shape of the final parts is determined by the <b>roller</b> <b>path,</b> not by the profile of the mandrel, which is different from conventional spinning processes. That is, DRCS is a dieless, flexible spinning process that can be used to produce a variety of shapes of flanges, including rectangular flanges.|$|R

Randle used cereal rye and crimson clover as cover crops before planting organic watermelon, squash, okra, and tomatoes.
