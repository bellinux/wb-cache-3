25|$|The {{pitcher who}} has the most shutouts {{at the end of}} the season is {{recognized}} as the league leader in that statistic.

25|$|Although {{this process}} might sound slow, {{it is very}} cache-local and highly {{parallelizable}} {{due to the lack}} of register dependencies and therefore in fact has excellent performance on modern out-of-order execution CPUs. A red-black tree for example performs much better on paper, but is highly cache-unfriendly and causes multiple pipeline and TLB stalls on modern CPUs which <b>makes</b> <b>that</b> algorithm bound by memory latency rather than CPU speed. In comparison, a bitwise trie rarely accesses memory, and when it does, it does so only to read, thus avoiding SMP cache coherency overhead. Hence, it is increasingly becoming the algorithm of choice for code that performs many rapid insertions and deletions, such as memory allocators (e.g., recent versions of the famous Doug Lea's allocator (dlmalloc) and its descendents).|$|E

25|$|As {{concrete}} instances Dumézil <b>makes</b> <b>that</b> of Vedic goddess Sarasvatī and Avestic Anāhīta. Sarasvati as river goddess {{is first}} a goddess {{of the third}} function, of vitality and fertility associated to the deities of the third function as the Aśvin and of propagation as Sinīvalī. She is the mother and on her rely all vital forces. But {{at the same time}} she belongs to the first function as a religious sovereign: she is pure, she is the means of purifications and helps the conceiving and realisation of pious thoughts. Lastly she is also a warrior: allied with the Maruts she annihilates the enemies and, sole among female goddesses, bears the epithet of the warrior god Indra, vṛtraghnỉ, destroyer of oppositions. She is the common spouse of all the heroes of the Mahābhārata, sons and heirs of the Vedic gods Dharma, Vāyu, Indra and of the Aśvin twins. Though in hymns and rites her threefold nature is never expressed conjointly (except in Ṛg Veda VI 61, 12:: triṣadásthā having three seats).|$|E

500|$|According to the Church, {{people have}} a right to private property. However, {{ownership}} <b>makes</b> <b>that</b> person [...] "a steward" [...] who is expected to make it [...] "fruitful" [...] or profitable in a way that benefits others after that person has first taken care of their family. Private property and the common good are seen as complementary elements that exist for the purpose of strengthening society. The taking of another's private property [...] "in obvious and urgent necessity" [...] as [...] "the only way to provide for immediate, essential needs (food, shelter, clothing)" [...] is not considered by the Church to be stealing. The concept of slavery as private property is condemned by the Church, which classifies it as the stealing of a person's human rights.|$|E

[...] Harold Zellner explains this apparent paradox {{as an integral part of}} the argument that Sappho <b>makes</b> <b>that</b> the most beautiful is the one that one loves: the apparent contradiction between Helen being the most beautiful, and Helen finding Paris the most beautiful, can be resolved if we agree with Sappho's definition of beauty.|$|E
