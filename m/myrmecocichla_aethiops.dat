50|$|The {{anteater}} chat or northern anteater-chat (<b>Myrmecocichla</b> <b>aethiops)</b> is {{a species of}} bird in the family Muscicapidae.It is found in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Gambia, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sudan, and Tanzania. Its natural habitats are dry savanna, subtropical or tropical dry lowland grassland, and subtropical or tropical high-altitude grassland.|$|E

Territory location in birds is often determined by availability of nesting habitat and we investigate whether this is the case for the little-studied Northern Anteater-chat <b>Myrmecocichla</b> <b>aethiops.</b> Territory size and location were mapped over two months in 2012 at 25 different sites where the birds occurred in central Nigeria and compared to 25 random sites where they did not, 500 m away. Vegetation variables, invertebrate abundance indicators, anthropogenic variables (availability of nest sites) and bird community components were measured and compared with adjoining areas (500 m away) from which the birds were absent in order to determine important factors determining territory location and size. Territories were 1. 23 ha (SE 0. 14) in size and were widely separated and so non-contiguous. Increasing numbers of abandoned wells, ant nests and termite mounds increased the probability of territory occupation. Territory size increased with the number of anteater-chats but decreased with increasing number of ant nests and overall bird diversity that were probably proxies for habitat quality. Overall, choice of preferred areas for the Northern Anteater-chat was centred on nesting sites and then habitat quality and group size probably determined territory size.
