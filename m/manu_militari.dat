50|$|Shortly after Joostens' arrival, the Boxer Rebellion, {{of which}} the first {{features}} showed {{in the winter of}} 1899, would reach its peak. This rebellion had anti-foreign, anti-Christian and mystical features and had among other things its origins in a crop failure in 1899, decades of frustrations about the Western presence in China and the chaos and internal struggles at the Chinese court following the failed Hundred Days' Reform. The wrath of the rebels was first aimed at Chinese Christians but later faced towards the foreign presence in China. Since the Belgians were not unlike the other foreign investments deemed unwanted elements in the Chinese society, the Beijing-Hankou Railway was also attacked and several Belgian engineers, missionaries and officials were killed. During the first quarrels in the streets of the Legation Quarters Joostens was accused of having killed several rebels, but since the Austro-Hungarian government offered to protect the Belgian legation, {{it is more likely that}} these soldiers have fired these shots. After the assassination of the German envoy Klemens von Ketteler near the Belgian legation and the refusal of the foreign diplomats to leave the Legation Quarter after Empress Dowager Cixi ordered them to do so, the rebellion reached a turning point. From now on, the Chinese Empire was at war with the foreign countries, and in this context, Joostens had to defend from 13 June until 16 June 1900, together with the other Belgians and the Austro-Hungarian marines, the Belgian legation. Despite their efforts, they were not able to repel the rebels and had to retreat to first the French and later the British legation. In the meantime, the Belgian legation, which was located in an isolated corner in the Legation Quarter, was plundered and set on fire. On 20 June 1901, the rebels sieged, in collaboration with Imperial Chinese Army, the Legation Quarter and with this act the so-called Siege of the International Legations was put in place. Shortly after the rebels sieged the Legation Quarter, the foreign powers gathered their forces and formed the Eight-Nation Alliance to crush the rebellion <b>manu</b> <b>militari.</b> Leopold II had also been very keen to participate and even privately funded a Belgian Expeditionary Corps but Kaiser Wilhelm II strongly opposed this idea and the king had to give up this plan.|$|E

There is a lively academic debate concerning US {{foreign policy in the}} post-Cold War era and especially after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001.

It will be demonstrated how a significant section of key opinion-forming newspapers of Britain, France, Germany and Italy framed neoconservatism during the administration of Bill Clinton and partly that of George W. Bush. There will be an exploration of whether and how newspapers vary in their coverage. The thesis will outline that the influence of the neoconservatives in US foreign policy can be disputed and will suggest that their ideas can be hardly considered as revolutionary ones. It will then focus on the media coverage and will show that the prominence devoted to neoconservatism by the accessed print sources is a relatively recent phenomenon. The findings indicate that the newspapers differed in their representation of the political ideology only in the period before 9 / 11 when they mainly discussed {{it in the context of}} domestic affairs. By contrast, after the terrorist atrocities and especially since 2003 they linked neoconservatism to US foreign policy and largely focused on it - as opposed to competing international relations theories -, representing it in a remarkably similar way. With the exception of The Times, which followed a comparatively balanced approach, they constructed it as a driving force behind George W. Bush's international politics approach and the war on Iraq. The media emphasis on neoconservatism will be attributed to different factors - such the scapegoat theory - which maybe influenced the journalistic work. The general consensus as to their understanding of neoconservatism and its supposed impact will not support the claim of a European public sphere but will be considered as a positive step towards its possible creation...|$|E
40|$|El objeto de este breve trabajo es mostrar la disposición de Anthony Gibbs & Sons, y de sus filiales, a apoyar el {{proyecto}} monopólico salitrero del Perú con recursos monetarios y los manejos de sus directores en la única empresa que, dada su capacidad de elaboración, podía hacerlo fracasar: la Compañía de Salitres y Ferrocarril de Antofagasta, de la que Gibbs era el segundo mayor accionista. Para {{el gobierno}} chileno la causa primaria de la guerra de 1879 fue el intento del Perú por monopolizar la producción salitrera. Bolivia, su aliada secreta desde 1873, colaboró arrendándole y vendiéndole sus depósitos de nitrato, e imponiendo a la exportación del salitre un tributo que infringió la condición -estipulada en un Tratado de Límites- bajo la cual Chile le cedió territorio. Su recuperación <b>manu</b> <b>militari</b> inició el conflicto. A partir de la segunda mitad del siglo pasado esta tesis economicista-legalista fue cuestionada en Chile y en el exterior, desplazando el acento causal al reordenamiento de los mercados de materias primas -de las que los beligerantes eran exportadores- a consecuencia de la crisis mundial de la década de 1870. This brief study aims at showing Anthony Gibbs & Sons disposition {{in supporting the}} Peruvian monopolistic nitrate project with monetary resources and its Director's influences in the only company which, due its production's capacity, could make the project fail: the Chilean Antofagasta Nitrate and Railway Co. in which Gibbs was {{the second most important}} stockholder. According to Chilean government the primary cause of 1879 's war was Peru's attempt to monopolize nitrate production. Bolivia, its secret allied since 1873, helped renting and selling him her nitrate fields and imposing a tax on the nitrate exports of the Chilean company in Antofagasta, thus violating the condition stated in a Border Treaty by which Chile had ceded territory. Its recovery through the use of military forcé was the first act of the conflict. This economic-legalist thesis was questioned in Chile and elsewhere around the second half of last century, placing war's causes accent on the rearrangement of raw material markets -the warring countries exported them- as a consequence of 1870 decade's world crisis...|$|E

40|$|The latest {{expansion}} of the EU towards the East has again modified its borders, showing once again the intangibility and flexibility of the latter. The very definition of border acquires different meanings depending on which theme is being discussed: an impenetrable barrier against migratory flows {{and the introduction of}} goods, transforming itself into a strainer for the exporting of national products. The new Internal Affairs Commissioner for the EU, Rocco Buttiglione, affirms on the one hand that migratory flows cannot be blocked <b>manu</b> <b>militari,</b> although he also believes that Europe decides who can enter and who cannot. Even within Europe, and despite the Schengen Agreements, borders are taking shape in concrete situations, reminding us that their disappearance is not definitive. We should differentiate between natural borders and those erected by man; in reference to the latter we will focus on walls, such as the one no longer standing in Berlin or that illegally erected by Israel in the Occupied Territories, scoffing at the international bodies dedicated to the defense of human rights and freedoms. In reference to natural borders, in direct opposition to those made by man, and due to the dramatic events that are taking place, we will concentrate on the oceans, true black holes in which the dreams of immigrants come to a tragic end. The absence of man-made elements can be more powerful than the presence of the very same barriers. The interesting thing about the Berlin Wall, having certain similarities to the Great Wall of China, is its slow (but deliberate) transformation from Cold War symbol to souvenir and finally its disappearance altogether in favour of urbanistic exploitation. The best analysis of this condition, as R. Koolhaas states (encloses free space, leaving outside the enclosed city), resides in its mutable situation, sometimes improvised evolution, and others detailed planning. It seems unfathomable that after the disappearance of one wall someone could construct another, especially under considerations so stingy such as those carved out by Israel. A proposition for the borders of the future: In agreement with J. Deridda, although arbitrarily applying his thinking to our reflections, it will consist in constantly questioning the relevance of the limit/boundary, equilibrating the pressure between the interior and exterior, {{as if it were a}} permeable membrane. That way we would recognise that marginality is not on one side, but rather on both, inside and out, expanding this way the boundaries of mere vertical elements in strips, that would be enriched by their own state, no longer the soil of anyone, but rather a place in constant state of redefinition, in agreement with the existing pressures, the situation and conformity of the border. In essence a sponge that absorbs and repels human demands depending on its capacity (unlimited), becoming a meeting place instead of an element to be crossed...|$|E
40|$|The {{division}} of the Korean peninsula is a unique case {{in the history of}} world politics and international relations. Also, it {{is still one of the}} main issues for the construction of a stable security regime in Northeast Asia. Finally, it is above all, the continuation of a "National Tragedy" that resulted in the loss of independence of the Korean people and the {{division of}} the Korean Nation, during and after Japanese colonial rule. Over the years, relations between the two Korean states have gone through ups and downs, often characterized by enmity and hostility. The first event in inter-Korean relations was in fact the Korean War (1950 - 53), which had the specific intent of reunifying the peninsula <b>manu</b> <b>militari.</b> Later, this attitude transformed into a hostile confrontation, until the establishment of a kind of “strategic rivalry” created space for timid experiments of cooperation. The end of the Cold War gave more freedom of action for the players involved, as well as a window of opportunity to intensify exchanges and cooperation between the two Koreas. In this context cooperation can be regarded as the key to the resolution of the inter-Korean dispute. In fact, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the North Korean regime managed to resist the crisis, avoid collapse and remain in power. The best chance for an improvement of the situation came from cooperation projects – in particular economic, cultural, humanitarian, military and even political– which made possible, in some specific historical periods, significant openings. In this dissertation I will start from outlining a theoretical paradigm of cooperation among states, that will be used to analyse the cooperative interactions that took place on the Korean peninsula. In particular, I will build a comprehensive model aimed at combining the different approaches to cooperation in existing literature. Great emphasis will be given to the strategies of creation of mutual trust in international relations, necessary to ensure long-term cooperation, and to engagement policies, seen as a constructive tool to begin a process of cooperation born from a situation of hostility. Afterwards, I will make a detailed reconstruction of the history of inter-Korean relations, paying greater attention to the historical phases in which the creation of episodes of cooperation has been possible. In this way, I will identify which were the conditions, both domestic and international, that made such developments possible. Finally, I will subject the cooperative relations on the peninsula to a detailed study through the theoretical framework outlined in the first part. In this way I will be able to assess the pre-conditions and causes of cooperation, as well as the results obtained and the effects on the political, economic and social equilibrium on the peninsula. In the latter part, particular attention will be given to the case of the construction of the joint industrial park in Kaesong and to economic cooperation, considered as one of the most promising possibilities toward building a peace-regime and the national reconciliation process...|$|E

Every agent asks the broker to log in the colony by declaring the resources that can be offered (with variable guarantees). Once logged in, an agent can ask the broker for other resources. Colonies can recursively be considered as evolved agents who can log in an outermost colony governed by another super-leader. Communications and routing intra-colonies goes through a broker- 2 -broker PKI-based negotiation. Every broker routes intra- and inter- service requests by filtering its resource routing table, and then forwarding the request first inside its colony, and second outside, via the proper super-leader (thus applying an endogenous-first-estrogen- last strategy). Theoretically, queries are formulæ in first-order logic equipped with a small program used to orchestrate and synchronize atomic formulæ (atomic services). When the client agent receives notification of all (or part of) the requested resources, then the real resource exchange is performed directly by the server(s) agents, without any further mediation of the broker, in a pure peer-to-peer fashion. The proposed overlay promotes an intermittent participation in the colony, since peers can appear, disappear, and organize themselves dynamically. This implies that the routing process may lead to failures, because some agents have quit or are temporarily unavailable, or they were logged out <b>manu</b> <b>militari</b> by the broker due to their poor performance or greediness. We aim to design, validate through simulation, and implement these foundations in an overlay network computer system. (From [Liquori-Cosnard TGC- 07 paper]) ...|$|E
