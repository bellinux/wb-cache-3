5|$|Five genetic {{types of}} HHT are recognized. Of these, three {{have been linked}} to {{particular}} genes, while the two remaining have currently only been associated with a particular locus. More than 80% of all cases of HHT are due to <b>mutations</b> in either ENG or ACVRL1. A total of over 600 different <b>mutations</b> is known. There {{is likely to be a}} predominance of either type in particular populations, but the data are conflicting. MADH4 <b>mutations,</b> which cause colonic polyposis in addition to HHT, comprise about 2% of disease-causing <b>mutations.</b> Apart from MADH4, it is not clear whether <b>mutations</b> in ENG and ACVRL1 lead to particular symptoms, although some reports suggest that ENG <b>mutations</b> are more likely to cause lung problems while ACVRL1 <b>mutations</b> may cause more liver problems, and pulmonary hypertension may be a particular problem in people with ACVRL1 <b>mutations.</b> People with exactly the same <b>mutations</b> may have different nature and severity of symptoms, suggesting that additional genes or other risk factors may determine the rate at which lesions develop; these have not yet been identified.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>mutations</b> within {{genes are}} neutral, having {{no effect on}} the organism's {{phenotype}} (silent <b>mutations).</b> Some <b>mutations</b> do not change the amino acid sequence because multiple codons encode the same amino acid (synonymous <b>mutations).</b> Other <b>mutations</b> can be neutral if they lead to amino acid sequence changes, but the protein still functions similarly with the new amino acid (e.g. conservative <b>mutations).</b> Many <b>mutations,</b> however, are deleterious or even lethal, and are removed from populations by natural selection. Genetic disorders are the result of deleterious <b>mutations</b> and can be due to spontaneous mutation in the affected individual, or can be inherited. Finally, a small fraction of <b>mutations</b> are beneficial, improving the organism's fitness and are extremely important for evolution, since their directional selection leads to adaptive evolution.|$|E
5|$|Multiple <b>mutations</b> in cTnI {{have been}} found to cause cardiomyopathies. cTnI <b>mutations</b> account for {{approximately}} 5% of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy cases and to date, more than 20 myopathic <b>mutations</b> of cTnI have been characterized.|$|E
40|$|<b>Mutation</b> {{testing is}} a fault-based {{technique}} for unit level software testing. Weak <b>mutation</b> was proposed {{as a way}} to reduce the expense of <b>mutation</b> testing. Unfortunately, weak <b>mutation</b> is also expected to provide a weaker test of the software than <b>mutation</b> testing does. This paper presents results from an implementation of weak <b>mutation,</b> which we used to evaluate the effectiveness versus the efficiency of weak <b>mutation.</b> Additionally, we examined several options in an attempt to find the most appropriate way to implement weak <b>mutation.</b> Our results indicate that weak <b>mutation</b> can be applied {{in a manner that is}} almost as effective as <b>mutation</b> testing, and with significant computational savings...|$|R
50|$|A <b>mutation</b> which {{completely}} removes superman {{gene function}} {{would result in}} flowers that carry extra stamens, replacing the pistils which would normally be developing in the fourth whorl. This <b>mutation</b> was named the sup-1 <b>mutation.</b> For the sup-1 <b>mutation,</b> More extreme stamen development is seen from a homozygous <b>mutation</b> than a heterozygous <b>mutation.</b>|$|R
30|$|Well-designed {{solution}} <b>mutation</b> (SM) {{operators are}} significant {{to the success}} of SA. In this research, we develop seven different (SM) operators. These are cell-number <b>mutation</b> operator (SM 1), machine-number <b>mutation</b> operator (SM 2), machine-inter-cell <b>mutation</b> operator (SM 3), machine-intra-cell <b>mutation</b> operator (SM 4), machine-location <b>mutation</b> operator (SM 5), route-volume <b>mutation</b> operator (SM 6) and part-operation <b>mutation</b> operator (SM 7). To implement each one of these operators on a solution, a period is selected randomly and then the <b>mutation</b> operator is implemented on the selected period of solution. If implementing one <b>mutation</b> operator results in an infeasible solution, that solution will be eliminated. These operators are implemented on the selected period of the solution as follows.|$|R
5|$|The {{most common}} genetic defects in FH are LDLR <b>mutations</b> (prevalence 1 in 500, {{depending}} on the population), ApoB <b>mutations</b> (prevalence 1 in 1000), PCSK9 <b>mutations</b> (less than 1 in 2500) and LDLRAP1. The related disease sitosterolemia, which has many similarities with FH and also features cholesterol accumulation in tissues, is due to ABCG5 and ABCG8 <b>mutations.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{prerequisite}} for natural selection {{to result in}} adaptive evolution, novel traits and speciation {{is the presence of}} heritable genetic variation that results in fitness differences. Genetic variation is the result of <b>mutations,</b> genetic recombinations and alterations in the karyotype (the number, shape, size and internal arrangement of the chromosomes). Any of these changes might have an effect that is highly advantageous or highly disadvantageous, but large effects are rare. In the past, most changes in the genetic material were considered neutral or close to neutral because they occurred in noncoding DNA or resulted in a synonymous substitution. However, many <b>mutations</b> in non-coding DNA have deleterious effects. Although both mutation rates and average fitness effects of <b>mutations</b> are dependent on the organism, a majority of <b>mutations</b> in humans are slightly deleterious.|$|E
5|$|A related {{argument}} against evolution {{is that most}} <b>mutations</b> are harmful. However, {{the vast majority of}} <b>mutations</b> are neutral, and the minority of <b>mutations</b> which are beneficial or harmful are often situational; a mutation that is harmful in one environment may be helpful in another.|$|E
25|$|A {{germline}} <b>mutation</b> {{gives rise}} to a constitutional <b>mutation</b> in the offspring, that is, a <b>mutation</b> that is present in every cell. A constitutional <b>mutation</b> can also occur very soon after fertilisation, or continue from a previous constitutional <b>mutation</b> in a parent.|$|R
50|$|Weak <b>mutation</b> testing (or weak <b>mutation</b> coverage) {{requires}} {{that only the}} first and second conditions are satisfied. Strong <b>mutation</b> testing {{requires that}} all three conditions are satisfied. Strong <b>mutation</b> is more powerful, since it ensures that the test suite can really catch the problems. Weak <b>mutation</b> is closely related to code coverage methods. It requires much less computing power to ensure that the test suite satisfies weak <b>mutation</b> testing than strong <b>mutation</b> testing.|$|R
50|$|The {{cause of}} {{alternating}} hemiplegia is the <b>mutation</b> of ATP1A3 gene. In {{a study of}} fifteen females and nine males’ patient with alternating hemiplegia, a <b>mutation</b> in ATP1A3 gene was present. Three patients showed heterozygous de-novo missense <b>mutation.</b> Six patients were found with de-novo missense <b>mutation</b> and one patient was identified with de-novo splice site <b>mutation.</b> De novo <b>mutation</b> is a <b>mutation</b> that occurs in the germ cell of one parent. Neither parent has the <b>mutation,</b> but it is passed to the child through the sperm or egg.|$|R
5|$|Although most <b>mutations</b> {{that change}} protein {{sequences}} are harmful or neutral, some <b>mutations</b> have benefits. These <b>mutations</b> may enable the mutant organism to withstand particular environmental stresses better than wild type organisms, or reproduce more quickly. In these cases a mutation {{will tend to}} become more common in a population through natural selection. Viruses that use RNA as their genetic material have rapid mutation rates, which can be an advantage, since these viruses thereby evolve rapidly, and thus evade the immune system defensive responses. In large populations of asexually reproducing organisms, for example, E. coli, multiple beneficial <b>mutations</b> may co-occur. This phenomenon is called clonal interference and causes competition among the <b>mutations.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another way enzyme {{malfunctions}} {{can cause}} disease comes from germline <b>mutations</b> in genes coding for DNA repair enzymes. Defects in these enzymes cause cancer because cells are {{less able to}} repair <b>mutations</b> in their genomes. This causes a slow accumulation of <b>mutations</b> and results {{in the development of}} cancers. An example of such a hereditary cancer syndrome is xeroderma pigmentosum, which causes the development of skin cancers in response to even minimal exposure to ultraviolet light.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{replication}} is for {{the most}} part extremely accurate, however errors (<b>mutations)</b> do occur. The error rate in eukaryotic cells can be as low as 10−8 per nucleotide per replication, whereas for some RNA viruses it can be as high as 10−3. This means that each generation, each human genome accumulates 1–2 new <b>mutations.</b> Small <b>mutations</b> can be caused by DNA replication and the aftermath of DNA damage and include point <b>mutations</b> in which a single base is altered and frameshift <b>mutations</b> in which a single base is inserted or deleted. Either of these <b>mutations</b> can change the gene by missense (change a codon to encode a different amino acid) or nonsense (a premature stop codon). Larger <b>mutations</b> can be caused by errors in recombination to cause chromosomal abnormalities including the duplication, deletion, rearrangement or inversion of large sections of a chromosome. Additionally, DNA repair mechanisms can introduce mutational errors when repairing physical damage to the molecule. The repair, even with mutation, is more important to survival than restoring an exact copy, for example when repairing double-strand breaks.|$|E
40|$|<b>Mutation</b> {{testing is}} a {{technique}} for unit testing software that, although powerful, is computationally expensive. The principal expense of <b>mutation</b> is that many variants of the test program, called mutants, must be repeatedly executed. Selective <b>mutation</b> {{is a way to}} reduce the cost of <b>mutation</b> testing by reducing the number of mutants that must be executed. This paper reports experimental results that compare selective <b>mutation</b> testing to standard, or non-selective, <b>mutation</b> testing. The results support the hypothesis that selective <b>mutation</b> is almost as strong as non-selective mutation; in experimental trials selective <b>mutation</b> provides almost the same coverage as non-selective <b>mutation,</b> with a four-fold or more reduction in cost...|$|R
40|$|<b>Mutation</b> {{analysis}} is a fault-based testing technique that uses <b>mutation</b> operators to introduce small changes into a program or specification, producing mutants, and then chooses test cases {{to distinguish the}} mutants from the original. <b>Mutation</b> operators differ in the coverage they get. They also differ {{in the number of}} mutants they generate. Consequently, selecting <b>mutation</b> operators is an important problem whose solution affects the effectiveness and cost of <b>mutation</b> testing. We use the automated test generation and evaluation method that combines a model checker and <b>mutation</b> analysis. We define a set of <b>mutation</b> operators and implement a <b>mutation</b> generator for specifications written in SMV, a popular model checker. To select the most effective <b>mutation</b> operators and sets of operators, we compare them using both theoretical and experimental methods. We construct <b>mutation</b> detection conditions and develop a technique to theoretically compare <b>mutation</b> operators. We apply <b>mutation</b> coverage and pairwise coverage metrics to empirically compare the effectiveness of <b>mutation</b> operators. To detect a fault in a program, a test case must cause the fault to affect the outputs, no...|$|R
30|$|<b>Mutation</b> causes small random {{changes to}} the children, {{promoting}} {{the diversity of the}} population. Only polynomial <b>mutation</b> as described in Deb (2001) is available in SWRDC, which depends on the <b>Mutation</b> Index and <b>Mutation</b> Probability parameters. The <b>Mutation</b> Index controls the intensity of the <b>mutation</b> (or the randomness) when altering the genes of a child. The <b>Mutation</b> Probability is the probability that each gene from a child will be mutated. A commonly used heuristic for <b>Mutation</b> Probability is 1 /(number of variables)[*]=[*] 1 /(2 N[*]+[*] 2) in SWRDC, where N is the degree of the Bezier curve.|$|R
5|$|FLCN <b>mutations</b> are {{detected}} by sequencing in 88% of probands with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome. This means {{that some people}} with the clinical diagnosis have <b>mutations</b> that are not detectable by current technology, or that <b>mutations</b> in another currently unknown gene could be responsible for a minority of cases. In addition, amplifications and deletions in exonic regions are also tested. Genetic testing can be useful to confirm the clinical diagnosis of {{and to provide a}} means of determining other at-risk individuals in a family even if they have not yet developed BHD symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Familial dilated {{cardiomyopathy}} (DCM) {{is a rare}} {{cause of}} systolic heart failure (prevalence 1:5000). A wider range of <b>mutations</b> (including some non-sarcomeric proteins as well) is associated with DCM. The cTnC <b>mutations</b> associated with DCM thus far are Y5H, Q50R, D75Y, M103I, D145E (also associated with HCM), I148V, and G159D. Of these, Q50R and G159D co-segregated with disease in affected family members, increasing confidence that they are clinically significant <b>mutations.</b> The biochemical consequences of thin filament DCM-associated <b>mutations</b> are less well established than for HCM, {{although there has been}} some suggestion that some of the <b>mutations</b> abolish the calcium desensitizing effect of cTnI phosphorylation at Ser22/23. This may be because some <b>mutations</b> disrupt the precise positioning of cNTnC for triggering muscle contraction when cTnI is unphosphorylated.|$|E
5|$|Familial {{prion disease}} occurs in {{families}} with a mutation in the PrP gene, and mice with PrP <b>mutations</b> develop prion disease despite controlled conditions where transmission is prevented. These mice can then transmit {{the disease to}} healthy, wild type mice, suggesting that mice with PrP <b>mutations</b> spontaneously generate infectivity.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new <b>mutation</b> operator, Hybrid <b>Mutation</b> (HPRM), for a genetic {{algorithm}} that generates high quality solutions to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The Hybrid <b>Mutation</b> operator constructs an offspring {{from a pair of}} parents by hybridizing two <b>mutation</b> operators, PSM and RSM. The efficiency of the HPRM is compared as against some existing <b>mutation</b> operators; namely, Reverse Sequence <b>Mutation</b> (RSM) and Partial Shuffle <b>Mutation</b> (PSM) for BERLIN 52 as instance of TSPLIB. Experimental results show that the new <b>mutation</b> operator is better than the RSM and PSM. Comment: ISSN (Online) : 1694 - 081...|$|R
40|$|This paper quantifies {{the expense}} of <b>mutation</b> {{in terms of the}} number of mutants that are created, then proposes and evaluates a {{technique}} that reduces the number of mutants by an order of magnitude.

30|$|<b>Mutation</b> function: Uniform <b>mutation</b> {{was adopted}} as a <b>mutation</b> function. According to Back et al. (1997), {{this is a}} simple <b>mutation</b> scheme. In uniform <b>mutation,</b> the {{positions}} of the genes that are likely to mutate are determined at the beginning. The chance of <b>mutation</b> is equal for all genes, but only those for which the <b>mutation</b> probability has taken place will undergo <b>mutation.</b> Then, the new gene is produced that replaces the selected ones. They are randomly selected out in uniform distribution from the search space (0, 1). The uniform <b>mutation</b> operator substitutes the value of the selected gene, which has a uniform random value between the user-determined upper and lower limits for that gene. The only application of this <b>mutation</b> operator is for float and integer genes (Sumathi and Paneerselvam 2010). In this work, the probability of a <b>mutation</b> occurring is equal to 0.02.|$|R
5|$|Genetic {{diagnosis}} in HHT is difficult, as <b>mutations</b> {{occur in}} numerous different {{locations in the}} linked genes, without particular <b>mutations</b> being highly frequent (as opposed to, for instance, the ΔF508 mutation in cystic fibrosis). Sequence analysis of the involved genes is therefore the most useful approach (sensitivity 75%), followed by additional testing to detect large deletions and duplications (additional 10%). Not all <b>mutations</b> in these genes have been linked with disease.|$|E

The <b>mutations</b> are located in {{a different part of}} the gene from those described in the related condition familial periodic paralysis. In TPP, the <b>mutations</b> described are single-nucleotide polymorphisms located in the hormone response element responsive to thyroid hormone, implying that transcription of the gene and production of ion channels may be altered by increased thyroid hormone levels. Furthermore, <b>mutations</b> have been reported in the genes coding for potassium voltage-gated channel, Shaw-related subfamily, member 4 (Kv3.4) and sodium channel protein type 4 subunit alpha (Na41.4).|$|E

HCM {{is described as a}} disease of the sarcomere, because <b>mutations</b> in the contractile proteins of the sarcomere have been identified in about half of patients with HCM. The cTnC <b>mutations</b> that have been associated with HCM are A8V, L29Q, A31S, C84Y, D145E. In all cases, the mutation was identified in a single patient, so additional genetic testing is needed to confirm or refute the clinical significance of these <b>mutations.</b> With most of these <b>mutations</b> (and with HCM-associated thin filament <b>mutations</b> in general), an increase in cardiac calcium sensitivity has been observed.|$|E
