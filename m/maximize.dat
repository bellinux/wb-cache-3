40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{aspect of}} any open payment {{system is the}} interchange fee that is paid from the merchant’s bank to the cardholder’s bank. Using a model {{in which there is}} partial participation by heterogeneous consumers and merchants, this paper characterizes the output <b>maximizing,</b> profit <b>maximizing</b> and welfare <b>maximizing</b> level of such an interchange fee. It examines how the optimal level of the fee depends on costs, profits margins, pass-through coefficients, participation rates, and membership fees, as well as two different strategic effects arising from competition between merchants. It also determines the factors which drive deviations between the output <b>maximizing,</b> profit <b>maximizing,</b> and welfare <b>maximizing</b> interchange fees. ...|$|R
