25|$|An {{external}} stimulus {{is required}} in order to trigger the differentiation of the meristem into a flower meristem. This stimulus will activate <b>mitotic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>division</b> in the meristem, particularly on its sides where new primordia are formed. This same stimulus will also cause the meristem to follow a developmental pattern that will lead to the growth of floral meristems as opposed to vegetative meristems. The main difference between these two types of meristem, apart from the obvious disparity between the objective organ, is the verticillate (or whorled) phyllotaxis, that is, the absence of stem elongation among the successive whorls or verticils of the primordium. These verticils follow an acropetal development, giving rise to sepals, petals, stamens and carpels. Another difference from vegetative axillary meristems is that the floral meristem is «determined», which means that, once differentiated, its cells will no longer divide.|$|E

Three evolutionarily conserved polarity protein complexes are crucial for defining the apical and basolateral boundaries of cells. In my thesis, I demonstrate {{that one of the}} vertebrate homologs of Crumbs- Crumbs 2 (Crb 2) plays context dependent roles in the developing nervous system using two model systems: the chick embryonic hindbrain and the mouse embryonic telencephalon. In the developing telencephalon, conditional ablation of Crb 2 leads to defects in recruitment of apical polarity proteins, cell junction proteins, positioning of <b>mitotic</b> <b>cells</b> and cortical neurogenesis. In the chick embryonic hindbrain, misexpression of Crb 2 affects morphology of the neural tube and also affects the apical localization of <b>cell</b> polarity proteins, <b>mitotic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> and neural differentiation. In addition to this, I demonstrate that a novel secreted splice variant of Crb 2 {{plays an important role in}} regulating neural crest cell migration. Taken together my analyses show that both loss and misexpression of Crb 2 have similar effects on the apical domain and in confining <b>mitotic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> to the apical domain.

50|$|Auxospores are {{involved}} in re-establishing the normal size in diatoms because successive <b>mitotic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> leads to a decrease in cell size.

Consequently, each division cycle decreases the average size of diatom cells in a population. When its size becomes too small, a dividing diatom cell produces an auxospore to expand its cell size back to that which is normal for vegetative cells.|$|R

40|$|Population geneticists make a {{distinction}} between sexual and asexual organisms depending on whether individuals inherit genes from one or two parents. When individual genes are considered, this distinction becomes less satisfactory for multicellular sexual organisms. Individual genes pass through numerous asexual <b>mitotic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> in the germline prior to meiosis and sexual recombination. The processes of mitotic mutation, mitotic crossing over, and mitotic gene conversion create genotypic diversity between diploid cells in the germline. Genes expressed in the germline whose products affect cell viability (such as many ``housekeeping'' enzymes) may be subjected to natural selection acting on this variability resulting in a non-Mendelian output of gametes. Such genes will be governed by the population genetics of the sexual/asexual life cycle rather than the conventional sexual/Mendelian life cycle. A model is developed to investigate some properties of the sexual/asexual life cycle. When appropriate parameter values were included in the model, it was found that mutation rates per locus per gamete may vary by a factor of up to 100 if selection acts in the germline. Sexual/asexual populations appear able to evolve to a genotype of higher fitness despite intervening genotypes of lower fitness, reducing the problems of underdominance and Wright's adaptive landscape encountered by purely sexual populations. As might be expected this ability is chiefly determined by the number of asexual <b>mitotic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> within the germline.

The corneal endothelial cells normally do not undergo <b>mitotic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>division,</b> and cell loss results in permanent loss of function. When endothelial cell counts drop too low, the pump starts failing to function and fluid moves anterior into the stroma and epithelium. The excess fluid precipitates swelling of the cornea.

However, studies of DNA repair in the brain and in muscle indicate that the transition from <b>mitotic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>division</b> to the post-mitotic condition that occurs early in life is accompanied by a reduction in DNA repair.

40|$|AbstractDuring {{male and}} female {{gametogenesis}} in species ranging from insects to mammals, germ cell cyst formation by incomplete cytokinesis involves the stabilization of cleavage furrows {{and the formation of}} stable intercellular bridges called ring canals. Accurate regulation of incomplete cytokinesis is required for both female and male fertility in Drosophila melanogaster. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms controlling complete versus incomplete cytokinesis are largely unknown. Here, we show that the scaffold protein Cindr is a novel component of both mitotic and meiotic ring canals during Drosophila spermatogenesis. Strikingly, unlike other male germline ring canal components, including Anillin and Pavarotti, Cindr and contractile ring F-actin dissociate from mitotic ring canals and translocate to the fusome upon completion of the <b>mitotic</b> germ <b>cell</b> <b>divisions.</b> We provide evidence that the loss of Cindr from mitotic ring canals is coordinated by signals that mediate the transition from germ cell mitosis to differentiation. Interestingly, Cindr loss from ring canals coincides with completion of the <b>mitotic</b> germ <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> in both Drosophila females and males, thus marking a common step of gametogenesis. We also show that Cindr co-localizes with Anillin at mitotic and meiotic ring canals and is recruited to the contractile ring by Anillin during male germ cell meiotic cytokinesis. Taken together, our analyses reveal a key step of incomplete cytokinesis at the endpoint of the <b>mitotic</b> germ <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> in D. melanogaster...|$|R
40|$|The intron 22 {{inversion}} {{represents the}} most prevalentfactor VIII gene defect in severe hemophilia A, accounting for about 40 % of all mutations.

The majority of inversion mutations originate in male germ cells, where the lack of bivalent formation may facilitate flipping of the telomeric end of the single X chromosome. This is the first intron 22 inversion that presents as a somatic mosaicism in a female, affecting only about 50 % of lymphocyte and fibroblast cells of the proposita. Supposing a post-zygotic de novo mutation as the usual cause of somatic mosaicism, the finding would imply that the intron 22 inversion mutation is not restricted to meiotic <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> but can also occur during <b>mitotic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>divisions,</b> either in germ cell precursors or in somatic cells.

5000|$|An ascus (plural asci; from Greek ἀσκός ảskós 'skin bag') is {{the sexual}} spore-bearing cell {{produced}} in ascomycete fungi. Asci usually contain eight ascospores, produced by meiosis followed, in most species, by a <b>mitotic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>division.</b> However, asci in some genera or species {{can occur in}} numbers of one (e.g. Monosporascus cannonballus), two, four, or multiples of four.

Ascospores are nonmotile, usually single celled, but not infrequently may be coenocytic (lacking a septum), {{and in some cases}} coenocytic in multiple planes. Mitotic divisions within the developing spores populate each resulting cell in septate ascospores with nuclei.
