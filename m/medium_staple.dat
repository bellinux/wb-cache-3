40|$|The authors examine risk {{management}} options for Egyptian cottons, the export prices for which are volatile. They use regression analysis to establish whether Egyptian cotton's prices can be effectively hedged by using existing futures contracts on the New York Cotton Exchange. They find {{no relationship between}} the movements in prices of Egyptian long and extra-long cottons and prices for the base quality of U. S. <b>medium</b> <b>staple</b> cotton traded on the New York futures market. (Probably because Egyptian cotton prices are government-determined, U. S. <b>medium</b> <b>staple</b> cotton prices are influenced by price support policies unrelated to the longer staple markets, and the fiber of the cottons analyzed have different physical characteristics.) So, the New York cotton futures market's No. 2 contract is not an appropriate mechanism for hedging the price risk facing Egyptian cotton under present procedures for determining prices - and probably not under market-determined prices. If the cotton market in Egypt is liberalized, cotton prices there may correlate more with prices elsewhere - especially for the longer staple cottons. The authors extend their regression analysis to the prices of other <b>medium</b> <b>staple</b> cottons - Australian, Central Asian, Mexican, Pakistani, and Turkish - to determine how they behave relative to U. S. <b>medium</b> <b>staple</b> cotton prices. None of these prices had short-term movements closely related to U. S. cotton prices, indicating mainly the influence of domestic policies on the U. S. market. Again, the New York futures No. 2 contract {{does not provide a}} satisfactory hedge for these cottons. The cotton futures contract recently introduced in New York (world cotton contract) - based on the Cotlook A Index - may prove useful for hedging the price risk for some cottons (especially Australian, Central Asian, and Pakistani) but apparently not Egyptian cotton. The authors recommend (together with privatizing the industry) establishing a domestic spot market to give transparency to the price-forming process. When the spot market is functioning well, establishing a foward market could provide a hedging instrument for Egyptian cotton.

40|$|Cotton is an {{important}} agricultural commodity, providing income to millions of farmers in industrial and developing countries. Technological changes in the textile industry mean that priorities concerning fibre properties have also changed and cotton breeders have concentrated on improvement in fibre traits {{to meet the demands}} of industry. Because of adoption of rotor spinning that converts raw fibre into yarns at a speed of 150 mmin- 1 as compared to 20 m min- 1 of ring spinning, the requirements of textile industries of raw cotton have changed. According to these new norms, fibre strength is a greater determinant of yarn quality. India is the only country where all four of the cultivated species of cotton are grown for commerce.

Abstract There is a steep rise in production of long staple cotton, while production of extra long staple, short staple and even <b>medium</b> <b>staple</b> cotton has come down drastically. Because of this, India is importing extra long staple cotton by causing heavy birth on exchequer and there is a need of improving performance of interspecific hybrids. This is possible through genetic improvement of barbadense lines. The elite barbadense combiners namely DB 533 and DB 534 were indentified for creation and exploitation of recombinational variability for combining ability. In 2007 - 2008 this cross was made and early segregating generations were raised during 2008 - 2009 / 2009 - 2010, out of 171 F 3 lines 53 were identified based on productivity and fiber quality and advanced to succeeding generations. The F 3 lines were evaluated for productivity and fiber quality parameters realizing the emphasis laid on developing ELS (Extra Long Stable) cotton hybrids out of 171 F 3 lines, only 53 F 3 lines with acceptable fiber strength were utilized in this study. The barbadense population of F 4 lines was selfed and material was advanced to F 5 generation during the same year. This study also focused attention on determining whether these barbadense lines can straight away be utilized as varieties for producing ELS cottons. Hence, 53 F 5 barbadense lines were evaluated for productivity traits and fiber quality traits and compared with Suvi...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1985 The Egyptian economy depends {{heavily on}} cotton {{as the major}} export {{commodity}} among agricultural commodities. Egypt is the largest exporter of extra long staple cotton in the world followed by Sudan and Peru. It provides about 45 {{percent of the world}} exports of extra long staple cotton. Instability in the demand and prices received for cotton result in instability in foreign exchange earnings upon which it depends for imports of other commodities. Therefore, Egyptian policy makers need to {{have a better understanding of}} the cotton market, of how the market functions, and of the factors which affect Egyptian exports. Egyptian cotton faces competition from other long staple exporting countries, mainly Sudan. The U. S. is the major producing and exporting country of short and <b>medium</b> <b>staple</b> cotton. The introduction of man-made fibers is believed to have affected the market for Egyptian cotton. The effect of variations in the income of the importing countries must be considered. In this study, a simultaneous equation model was developed in order to investigate these effects. The model consists of eight structural equations, representing the demand for and supply of export cotton for Egypt, Sudan, Peru and the U. S. The analysis is based on time series data for the period 1950 - 80. The results show that the export price of each country is the major factor in determining the export sales of its cotton. Demand elasticities ranged from - 0. 95 to - 1. 21. Egypt's export price affects the demand for Sudan's cotton, and Sudan's price affects the demand for Egypt's cotton. Peru's export quantities are affected by Egypt and Sudan prices more than they affect them. U. S. prices, and man-made fiber prices didn't significantly affect the demand for long staple cotton. The export supply for Egypt, Sudan and Peru is insensitive to changes in own export price...|$|E
40|$|Carding {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} preparatory processes in the short-staple spinning of yarn from a raw material such as cotton. The main purpose of carding is to individualise fibres thoroughly so that they can be spun into yarns. Therefore, the quality of the yarns spun and the quality of fabrics produced from them is largely determined by the effectiveness of the carding process. The design of the licker-in zone determines the degree of pre-opening, and so plays a major role in determining the carding efficiency. This work investigates and evaluates the influence and effectiveness of licker-in design in determining the quality of carded yarns and the fibre configurations in yarn with the two licker-in designs in use today, viz. the single and triple licker-in designs. Two Indian cotton fibre varieties with widely differing characteristics were processed on a commercial high-production card using the single and triple licker-in systems. The quality of yarns spun revealed that licker-in design indeed has a bearing on fibre, yarn and fabric quality. Test results show that whilst the triple licker-in system demonstrated a relative improvement in the yarn quality when processing the <b>medium</b> <b>staple</b> cotton of average fineness, the single licker-in was observed to be more suitable for the longer and finer variety. The analysis of the fibre configuration in yarns indicates that licker-in designs as well as the processing parameters such as licker-in speed and carding rate have an influence on the fibre configuration. Yarns spun using the material processed through the triple licker-in showed more disorder than those of the single licker-in. Finally, an investigation into the fibre opening at the licker-in using high-speed video photography indicates that the degree of opening and the fibre orientation on the licker-in surface before fibre transfer to the main carding cylinder is different between the two licker-in systems. The degree of opening and fibre orientation were also found to depend on the cotton variety, the production rate and licker-in parameters such as speed.

Dick Auld showed that chemical mutagenesis {{could be used}} to enhance fiber length of a <b>medium</b> <b>staple</b> cotton cultivar without sacrificing yield. The goal of this project was to determine if mutagenesis {{could be used to}} improve the fiber quality of a germplasm line already considered to be at the upper-limits of fiber length. Seed of TAM 94 L- 25 were treated with EMS in 2001 and the M 2 generation was produced at Lubbock, Texas in 2002. More than 1200 M 3 plants were grown at College Station, Texas in 2004, harvested individually, and HVI fiber properties determined. The top and bottom 1 percent for UHML, strength, and elongation were selected and the seeds of these individuals planted as an M 4 progeny row nursery in 2005. Approximately ten individual plants per progeny row were harvested for re-evaluation of fiber parameters. From the approximately 1600 individual TAM 94 L- 25 M 4 plants harvested in 2005, 61 were selected and subsequently treated as pure lines. Agronomic performance trials were conducted on 61 of those TAM 94 L- 25 M lines along with the M 0 check and two commercial cultivar checks, Fiber Max 832 and Phytogen 355, in 2008 and 2009 in College Station and Weslaco, Texas. Within-boll yield components were examined for 13 representative mutant lines and the three checks. TAM 94 L- 25 averaged 751 kg lint ha^- 1, 31. 1 mm UHML, 303 kN m kg^- 1 fiber bundle strength, and 6. 0 percent elongation. The 61 mutant lines yielded from 366 to 932 kg lint ha^- 1, exhibited UHML from 24. 3 to 34. 9 mm, fiber bundle strengths of 261 to 333 kN m kg^- 1, and elongations from 5. 4 to 8. 1 percent. Seed surface area of the TAM 94 L- 25 M-lines was between 99 and 124 mm^ 2, and fibers per unit seed surface area from 123 to 168 fibers mm^- 2. The M 0 parent, TAM 94 L- 25 averaged 125 mm^ 2 seed- 1, and 128 fibers mm^- 2.

40|$|Pest {{control with}} fewer {{chemicals}} Cue: If farmers plant the same crop {{on the same}} land each year, as many do, one very great danger is {{that the number of}} pests feeding on the crop can grow and grow. Such a build up in pest numbers makes the task of obtaining a good harvest increasingly difficult, and expensive. Because of this, many who practise Integrated Pest Management use the technique of crop rotation ? moving crops around the farm, or simply using their land for a different crop in the new season. Growing a cereal crop followed by a legume crop is one common example. Cotton plants are very susceptible to insect pests, particularly a group of pests called bollworms. To prevent the number of these insects increasing on their farms, it is essential that cotton farmers destroy all their cotton plants between cropping seasons. When buying cotton seed for planting, the seed packets should give clear information about the dates that the plants should be destroyed after the crop has been harvested. But of course, some farmers may not be {{aware of the importance of}} this information. So how to communicate this important message about cotton production? In Zimbabwe the Cotton Research Institute has been working for many years to improve cotton production in the country. Busani Bafana visited the institute to find out what is currently being done to help cotton farmers in fighting bollworm pests. IN:		?Zimbabwe is among the top five ? OUT:		? footsteps in this direction. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 32 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Alois Chimoga, Principal Research Officer at the Cotton Research Institute in Kadoma, Zimbabwe. Transcript Bafana	Zimbabwe is among the top five producers of hand picked <b>medium</b> <b>staple</b> cotton. The government has ensured the maintenance of this standard of cotton production through the establishment of the Cotton Research Institute in 1925. One of the challenges of growing cotton is the ability to manage pests. For example bollworm, a key pest of cotton can reduce yields by up to 60 % if not controlled. We spoke to an entomologist, Mr Alois Chimoga who is the Principal Research Officer in Kadoma, Zimbabwe. How has your institute helped farmers in this regard? Chimoga	Farmers have been helped to control pests by a dead period of 66 days when cotton is not allowed to grow. During the growing season farmers have been taught to do scouting, to look for the pests. If the pests are there in high numbers they only apply chemicals as a last resort. In doing scouting they are supposed to apply chemicals following the labels, very low dose when the plants are very small and when the plants are very high we apply high doses. These have helped the cotton farmers to have high quality. The scouting also helps the pests to be controlled by predators, because the period where no chemicals are applied the predators will be in big numbers controlling the pests. Bafana	The IPM approach has gained respect in a number of African countries. How has it been received by farmers the Institute here has worked with? Chimoga	The farmers have received us very well and they understand it very well as pest management. Such as the destruction dates, after you have picked your cotton you destroy the cotton crop, they have understood this because on every pocket of seed there are dates for the destruction period and they have taken this very well. They know when you grow cotton you need to follow guidelines. Bafana	Mr Chimoga, what particular hurdles have you had to overcome to ensure that farmers understand this approach and they implement it? Chimoga	Farmers had heard of using some of the chemicals which we don?t allow like pyrethroids, which are supposed to be used from January up to the end of season, and non-pyrethroids from emergence up to January. We have moved away from this hurdle by insisting that the marketing companies will produce, will supply the chemicals, give the farmers these chemicals, during the appropriate time, even the agrochemical companies. So far we have had good success with fenvalarate, one of the pyrethroids which has shown resistance in other countries from the bollworms. In Zimbabwe we don?t have any problems with fenvalarate as far as Heliothis bollworm is concerned. Bafana	We would like to know what practical benefits of the Integrated Pest Management approach have you realised in the way farmers in Zimbabwe grow and harvest their cotton? Chimoga	Farmers have benefited quite a lot. They use low chemicals. Zimbabwe is renowned for low chemicals compared to their South Africa our neighbours. Farmers have recouped more money from their high quality hand picked cotton as a result. So far our cotton, it is not sticky, it is liked by all the stakeholders in the cotton industry despite of it being very low in terms of the quantity. Bafana	What are the future trends in the implementation of Integrated Pest Management in Zimbabwe for cotton growers? Chimoga	Our future plans for cotton growers, as an institute, is to provide them with the new technology. So far we have been allowed by the Biosafety Board to experiment on GMO?s. We are making concerted efforts to look at the aspect of how pest GMO?s are going to control the red bollworm, the Heliothis bollworm that causes 60 % of yield loss. In 2 - 3 years? time we shall be able to have a lot of footsteps in this direction.
