Groundwater is a major component of agricultural water use. In extensive regions of the Western United States, rural agricultural economies rely entirely on groundwater. At the same time as providing water for human needs, groundwater is also an input to streams, wetlands and riparian areas that provide important ecosystem services. Ongoing groundwater pumping will deplete flows in adjacent streams, leading to potential conflict between human and environmental uses of water. In the last decades, many conflicts over transboundary allocations of water, endangered species and instream and riparian habitat have been driven by surface water-groundwater interaction. for example, claims have been filed with the United States Supreme Court over <b>mpacts</b> of groundeater use on flows of transboundary rivers for the Pecos River (Texas vs. New Mexico), the Arkansas River (Kansas vs. Colorado), and the Republican River (Kansas vs. Nebraska and Colorado). Groundwater has typically been viewed as private property, and its use in agriculture is generally neither regulated nor quantified precisely. However, there is growing interest in moving to systems that regulate groundwater use. The ability to trade groundwater allocations is often a part of such conversations...|$|R

40|$|Russia's {{boreal forests}} provide {{numerous}} important ecosystem functions and services, {{but they are}} being increasingly affected by climate change. This review presents an overview of observed and potential future climate change impacts on those forests {{with an emphasis on}} their aggregate carbon balance and processes driving changes therein. We summarize recent findings highlighting that radiation increases, temperature-driven longer growing seasons and increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentrations generally enhance vegetation productivity, while heat waves and droughts tend to decrease it. Estimates of major carbon fluxes such as net biome production agree that the Russian forests as a whole currently act as a carbon sink, but these estimates differ in terms of the magnitude of the sink due to different methods and time periods used. Moreover, models project substantial distributional shifts of forest biomes, but they may overestimate {{the extent to which the}} boreal forest will shift poleward as past migration rates have been slow. While other impacts of current climate change are already substantial, and projected impacts could be both large-scale and disastrous, the likelihood for (climate-driven) disturbances such as fires and insect outbreaks, which are expected to increase in the future. We conclude that the <b>mpacts</b> of climate change on Russia's boreal forest are often superimposed by other environmental and societal changes in a complex way, and the interaction of these developments could exacerbate both existing and projected future challenges. Hence, development of adaptation and mitigation strategies for Russia's forests is strongly advised...|$|R

The action of the great events is not confined only in the period of the event but it extends before it and, more and more, after the end of it. In the more recent events the transformation of the city has interested the urbanized parts of it and has become the occasion for transforming the builded city and modifying the profile of a city. The paper deepens the question of the event’s classification and of their impact on the urban system. It is organized in three parts. The first part analyses two types of great events (the international expositions and the Olympic games) with the aim to characterize a shared definition. The second part identifies the more important factors and indicators for to analyse the category of the great events. The last part is based on the factors <b>mpacting</b> on the urban system and on the organization of its mobility. In particular, the concept of “pulsar effect” is deepen: it is the multiplicative effect on a city evolution in relation to the organization of sequential or parallel multiple events. One of the more negative impact of a great event is the dissipation of the benefits in the time for the lack of other events. In this way the city loses the acquired advantages and return in the same pre-event state. For preserving the advantages it is necessary to strengthen the acquired position with other events...|$|R

Contemporary {{comparisons}} of reusable and single-use perioperative textiles (surgical gowns and drapes) reflect {{major changes in the}} technologies to produce and reuse these products. Reusable and disposable gowns and drapes meet new standards for medical workers and patient protection, use synthetic lightweight fabrics, and are competitively priced. In multiple science-based life cycle environmental studies, reusable surgical gowns and drapes demonstrate substantial sustainability benefits over the same disposable product in natural resource energy (200 %- 300 %), water (250 %- 330 %), carbon footprint (200 %- 300 %), volatile organics, solid wastes (750 %), and instrument recovery. Because all other factors (cost, protection, and comfort) are reasonably similar, the environmental benefits of reusable surgical gowns and drapes to health care sustainability programs are important for this industry. Thus, it is no longer valid to indicate that reusables are better in some environmental i! <b>mpacts</b> and disposables are better in other environmental impacts. It is also important to recognize that large-scale studies of comfort, protection, or economics have not been actively pursued in the last 5 to 10 years, and thus the factors to improve both reusables and disposable systems are difficult to assess. In addition, the comparison related to jobs is not well studied, but may further support reusables. In summary, currently available perioperative textiles are similar in comfort, safety, and cost, but reusable textiles offer substantial opportunities for nurses, physicians, and hospitals to reduce environmental footprints when selected over disposable alternatives. Evidenced-based comparison of environmental factors supports the conclusion that reusable gowns and drapes offer important sustainability improvements. The benefit of reusable systems may be similar for other reusables in anesthesia, such as laryngeal mask airways or suction canisters, but life cycle stu! dies are needed to substantiate these benefits.

40|$|This Water Policy Briefing {{is based}} on the CA Research Report 4 : Does International Cereal Trade Save Water? The Impact of Virtual Water Trade on Global Water Use (CA Research Report 4) by Charlotte de Fraiture, Ximing Cai, Upali Amarasinghe, Mark Rosegrant and David Molden; and on Investing in Water for Food, Ecosystems and Livelihoods (BLUE PAPER, Stockholm 2004, Discussion Draft) by David Molden and Charlotte de Fraiture; and on Is Virtual Water Trade a Solution for Water Scarce Countries? by Charlotte de Fraiture and David Molden, Bridges 2004. By the year 2050 there will be an {{additional}} 3 billion people to feed. Food production may need to increase by 70 - 90 percent from levels in 2000 to meet this global food demand. Without improvements in the efficiency and productivity of agricultural water use, crop water consumption would have to grow by the same order of magnitude. A big challenge in water management is to grow sufficient food for a growing and more affluent population while meeting the many other demands on limited water resources?household needs, industrial requirements and environmental functions. Already, an estimated 20 % of the global population lives in river basins that are characterized by physical water scarcity. International food trade can have significant impacts on national water demand. The term ?virtual water?, first introduced by Allan (1998), refers to the volume of water used to produce traded crops. By importing food a country ?saves? the amount of water it would have required to produce it on its own soil. Thus, international food trade can have important <b>mpacts</b> on how and where water is used. Food trade reduces water use at two levels. At a national level, a country reduces water use by importing food rather than producing it. At a global level, trade reduces water use because, at present, production in exporting countries is more water efficient than in importing countries. Moreover, four of the five major grain exporters produce under highly productive rainfed conditions while importing countries would have relied more on irrigation. In fact, without cereal trade, global irrigation water demand would have been higher by 11 %. Some researchers have suggested that international food trade can and should be used as an active policy instrument to mitigate local and regional water scarcity. They contend that, instead of striving for food self-sufficiency, water short countries should import food from water abundant countries. Indeed, food trade has a large potential to alleviate water scarcity, but in practice there are many reasons why this is unlikely to happen in the near future...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{development}} of a 3 -D failure criterion for saline ice is presented. The need for such general 3 -D failure formulation stems from the fact that, during ice-ship interactions, ice undergoes a complex state of deformation and stress before it fails and breaks away, {{and the use of the}} uniaxial strength of ice to compute impact ice loads may lead to inaccurate load calculations and non-conclusive results. In recent years, with the availability of High Power Computers (HPC), numerical methods are being used more than ever before in marine and ice engineering problems. Numerical models based on computational techniques such as finite elements, boundary elements and discrete elements require 3 -D constitutive models and failure criteria to represent the behavior of the materials involved (such as the behavior of the ship structure, ice, and water "fluid"). At high-speed <b>mpacts</b> (strain rates > 10 - 3 s- 1), ice behaves as a linear elastic material with a brittle mode of failure. Previously, Derradfi-Aouat [Derradji-Aouat, A., 2000. A unified failure envelope for isotropic freshwater ice and iceberg ice. ASME/OMAE- 2000, Int. Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering, Polar and Arctic section New Orleans, US, PDF file # OMAW- 2000 -P?A # 1002] developed a unified 3 -D failure envelope for both fresh water isotropic ice and iceberg ice. In this paper, that formulation is extended to include failure of saline ice (in addition to fresth water ice and iceberg ice.) The results of a significant number of true triaxial tests using Laboratory Grown Ice (LGSI) were obtained from the open literature. The results of these tests formed a database that enables the existing failure model [Derradji-Aouat, A., 2000. A unified failure envelope for isotropic freshwater ice and iceberg ice. ASME/OMAE- 2000, Int. Conference on Offshore Mechancis and Arctic Engineering, Polar and Arctic section, New Orleans, US, PDF file # OMAE- 2000 -P/A # 1002] to be extended from the isotropic fresh water ice and iceberg ice to columnar saline ice. Mroz's [J. Mech. Phys. Solids 15 (1967) 163] concept for the multi-surface failure theory is used in both studies (the present study, for saline ice, as well as in the previous study, for the fresh water isotropic ice and iceberg ice). It appears that the same set of the equations is applicable to the failure of all three types of ice. The possibility of the existence of a universal and general failure criterion for all types of ice is discussed. The validation of the present multi-surface failure criterion was discussed on the basis of comparisions between predicted failure curves and actual true triaxial test results.
