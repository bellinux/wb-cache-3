60|$|The reindeer, however, {{formed the}} {{favourite}} food and favourite {{model of the}} pre-Glacial artists. Perhaps it was a better sitter than the mammoth; certainly {{it is much more}} frequently represented on these early prehistoric bas-reliefs. The high-water mark of palæolithic art is undoubtedly {{to be found in the}} reindeer of the cave of Thayngen, in Switzerland, a capital and spirited representation of a buck grazing, in which the perspective of the two horns is better managed than a Chinese artist would manage it at the present day. Another drawing of two reindeer fighting, scratched on a fragment of schistose rock and unearthed in one of the caves of Périgord, though far inferior to the Swiss specimen in spirit and execution, is yet not without real merit. The perspective, however, displays one marked infantile trait, for the head and legs of one deer are seen distinctly through the body of another. Cave bears, fish, <b>musk</b> <b>sheep,</b> foxes, and many other extinct or existing animals are also found among the archaic sculptures. Probably all these creatures were used as food; and it is even doubtful whether the artistic troglodytes were not also confirmed cannibals. To quote Mr. Andrew Lang once more on primitive man, 'he lived in a cave by the seas; he lived upon oysters and foes.' The oysters are quite undoubted, and the foes may be inferred with considerable certainty.|$|E
60|$|The old master, then, carved his {{bas-relief}} in pre-Glacial Europe, just at {{the moment}} before the temporary extinction of his race in France by the coming on of the Great Ice Age. We can infer this fact from {{the character of the}} fauna by which he was surrounded, a fauna in which species of cold and warm climates are at times quite capriciously intermingled. We get the reindeer and the mammoth {{side by side with the}} hippopotamus and the hyena; we find the chilly cave bear and the Norway lemming, the <b>musk</b> <b>sheep</b> and the Arctic fox in the same deposits with the lion and the lynx, the leopard and the rhinoceros. The fact is, as Mr. Alfred Russel Wallace has pointed out, we live to-day in a zoologically impoverished world, from which all the largest, fiercest, and most remarkable animals have lately been weeded out. And it was in all probability the coming on of the Ice Age that did the weeding. Our Zoo can boast no mammoth and no mastodon. The sabre-toothed lion has gone the way of all flesh; the deinotherium and the colossal ruminants of the Pliocene Age no longer browse beside the banks of Seine. But our old master saw the last of some at least among those gigantic quadrupeds; it was his hand or that of one among his fellows that scratched the famous mammoth etching on the ivory of La Madelaine and carved the figure of the extinct cave bear on the reindeer-horn ornaments of Laugerie Basse. Probably, therefore, he lived in the period immediately preceding the Great Ice Age, or else perhaps in one of the warm interglacial spells with which the long secular winter of the northern hemisphere was then from time to time agreeably diversified.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike {{many other}} regions, this valley is a {{sanctuary}} to many highly endangered animals, including snow leopards and Red pandas. Other mammals include lynx, Asian black bear, grey wolf, dhole, Assam macaque, Himalayan <b>musk</b> deer, blue <b>sheep,</b> Himalayan tahr, mainland serow, Himalayan goral, woolly hare, horseshoe bat, Himalayan mouse-hare and black-lipped pika. [...] Over 110 species of birds, 33 mammals, 11 butterflies and 3 reptiles have been recorded. Conservation of wild {{life in the}} area has been achieved by monks of the monasteries in the area by putting a hunting ban in place. This action has helped the wildlife to prosper. The area is now an important habitat for the snow leopard, grey wolf, <b>musk</b> deer, blue <b>sheep</b> and the Himalayan tahr.|$|R
50|$|They {{primarily}} prey on Plateau pikas, {{followed by}} rodents, marmots, woolly hares and lizards. They may also scavenge on the carcasses of Tibetan antelopes, <b>musk</b> deer, blue <b>sheep</b> and livestock. Tibetan foxes are mostly solitary, daytime hunters as their main prey, pikas, are diurnal. Tibetan foxes may form commensal relationships with brown bears during hunts for pikas. The bears dig out the pikas, and the foxes grab {{them when they}} escape the bears.|$|R
50|$|Post-Kansan {{glaciation}} Nebraska {{was home}} to bear, giant bears, giant bison, caribou, wild cats, wild cattle, cougars, deer, jaguars, true moose, animals resembling musk oxen, actual <b>musk</b> oxen, mountain <b>sheep,</b> and giant stag-moose. Archidiskodon imperator maibeni left remains in Lincoln County. Platycerabos dodsoni was a wild cow known from Cass County. Other Late Pleistocene mammals included Ambelodon fricki, extinct bison species, modern bison, modern coyotes, and a saber-toothed cat unrelated to Smilodon. The camel Camelops appeared during the later Pleistocene. Some Nebraskan fossil-bearing deposits of Late Pleistocene age preserve animal remains associated with humans.|$|R
40|$|DNA was {{extracted}} from teeth and bones of Myotragus balearicus, a bovid that evolved in isolation on the Balearic Islands (Western Mediterranean) {{from the end}} of the Miocene, becoming extinct 4, 000 years BP, after the arrival of humans in the islands. The numerous morphological apomorphies of Myotragus, most strikingly its dwarfism, frontal eyes, and ever-growing incisors, obscure its phylogenetic relationships with extant bovids. Therefore, the recovery of genetic information from Myotragus is of significant interest to help clarify the taxonomic position of this species. In this study we amplified and sequenced a 95 bp (base pair) fragment of the mtDNA cytochrome b gene from 6, 000 -year-old specimens of Myotragus. Several experimental controls, such as amino acid analysis, independent reproduction in two different laboratories, and cloning of the PCR product, support the authenticity of the ancient DNA sequence recovered. Phylogenetic comparison with orthologous sequences from supposedly related extant genera (serow, goral, mountain goat, chamois, takin, sheep, goat, Himalayan tahr, arctic <b>musk</b> ox, barbary <b>sheep,</b> blue sheep, and saiga) from the Caprinae subfamily suggests that Myotragus is related to some of these species. However, the real phylogenetic position of Myotragus is difficult to assess, due to the lack of resolution of the present molecular study, which can be partially attributed to the short length of the genetic fragment recovered.
