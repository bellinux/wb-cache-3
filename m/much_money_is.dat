2500|$|Simply put, {{economic}} bubbles {{often occur}} when too <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>is</b> chasing too few assets, causing both good assets and bad assets to appreciate excessively beyond their fundamentals to an unsustainable level. [...] Once the bubble bursts, {{the fall in}} prices causes the collapse of unsustainable investment schemes (especially speculative and/or Ponzi investments, but not exclusively so), {{which leads to a}} crisis of consumer (and investor) confidence that may result in a financial panic and/or financial crisis; if there is monetary authority like a central bank, it may be forced to take a number of measures in order to soak up the liquidity in the financial system or risk a collapse of its currency. [...] This may involve actions like bailouts of the financial system, but also others that reverse the trend of monetary accommodation, commonly termed forms of 'contractionary monetary policy'.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to his other interests, Laird founded the Xeric Foundation, a nonprofit organization created after considerable thought, as [...] "an appropriate way to give back something extra to the comics world," [...] by providing grants for self-publishers. While Eastman founded Tundra Publishing to embody {{the ideals of the}} Creator's Bill of Rights from a publishers standpoint, Laird's vision involved funding rather than actively publishing individuals' work. His reasoning for this decision was in part simply due to him having [...] "far too much to do as it is with Mirage." [...] He [...] "preferred to do something where {{it was more of a}} transfer of capital," [...] with [...] "all the worries... on other people's shoulders." [...] The foundation itself, he explains is: [...] "actually two foundations in one. One half of it is for charitable organizations, and the other half is for creators who want to self-publish their comics." [...] That later half is perhaps what the foundation is best known for, working much the same as any benevolent fund, involving an applicatory process detailing how <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>is</b> being applied for and why.|$|E

And he urges the importance of religion in American life and so forth. The whole trip is about religion. That's measurable." [...] Pincus stated that [...] "the court of appeals said, that this Court has identified a second limitation, which is not incidental. The money has to be centralthe money that's being challenged has to be central to the violation. Just as you couldn't challenge a prayer breakfast". As in Bowen there had to be [...] "a specific action that allocated a specific amount of money". Pincus opined that no taxpayer would be given standing to sue agents of the United States Secret Service for accompanying a President on a trip for a religious purpose as they would be there [...] "protecting him for a protection purpose. His trip is for a religious purpose. And I think our submission {{is that there is a}} distinction that can be drawn there." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 124.

How many of them have taught it? Some have; but only incidentally; and others will say it is a truism. If it be, do the public know it? Does your ordinary English householder know that every costly dinner he gives has destroyed forever as much money as it is worth? Does every well-educated girl--do even the women in high political position--know that every fine dress they wear themselves, or cause to be worn, destroys precisely so much of the national money as the labor and material of it are worth? If this be a truism, it is one that needs proclaiming somewhat louder.|$|E

60|$|It {{is not an}} easy {{matter to}} come at the real cost of the kingly office in this country, all the {{expenditures}} of the European governments being mystified in such a way, as to require a very intimate knowledge of the details to give a perfectly clear account of them. But, so far as I have been able to ascertain, the charges that arise from this feature of the system do not fall much short, if indeed they do any, of eight millions of dollars annually. Out of this sum, however, the king pays the extra allowances of his guards, the war office taking the same view of all classes of soldiers, after distinguishing between foot and cavalry. You will get an idea of the luxury of royalty by a short account of the gardes du corps. These troops are all officers, the privates having the rank and receiving the pay of lieutenants. Their duty, as the name implies, is to have the royal person in their especial care, and there is always a guard of them in an ante-chamber of the royal apartments. They are heavy cavalry, and when they mount guard in the palaces, their arm is a carabine. A party of them always appear near the carriage of the king, or indeed near that of any of the reigning branch of the family. There are said to be four regiments or companies of them, of four hundred men each; but it strikes me the number must be exaggerated. I should think, however, that there are fully a thousand of them. In addition to these selected troops, there are three hundred Swiss, of the Swiss and royal guards; of the latter, including all arms, there must be many thousands. These are the troops that usually mount guard in and about all the palaces. The annual budget of France appears in the estimates at about a milliard, or a thousand millions of francs; but the usual mystifications are resorted to, and the truth will give the annual central expenses of the country at not less, I think, than two hundred millions of dollars. This sum, however, covers many items of expenditure, that we are accustomed to consider purely local. The clergy, for instance, are paid out of it, as is a portion of the cost of maintaining the roads. On the other hand, <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>is</b> collected, as a general regulation, that does not appear in the budget. Few or no churches are built, and there are charges for masses, interments, christenings, and fees for a hundred things, of which no account is taken in making out the sum total of the cost of government.|$|E
