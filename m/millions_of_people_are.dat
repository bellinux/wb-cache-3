Kristof thanked Invisible Children {{for making}} the film and {{addressed}} its criticism, stating that rather than being [...] "white man's burden", when [...] "a warlord continues to kill and torture across a swath of Congo and Central African Republic ... it's a human burden." [...] He also said that complexity had long been [...] "a leading excuse for inaction during atrocities" [...] and that Kony remains a threat in Uganda's neighbour countries, so {{the simplicity of the}} film [...] "has left the American public more informed" [...] than it would be otherwise, and that if he [...] "were a Congolese villager", he would [...] "welcome these uncertain efforts over the sneering scorn of do-nothing armchair cynics." [...] Foreign correspondent Roger Cohen called it [...] "simplifying grossly and distorting adeptly to make a valid point: that no effort should be spared to arrest Kony." [...] British film critic Peter Bradshaw wrote that Kony 2012, despite its flaws, [...] "lands an almighty punch. This is a principled campaign ad, and a very, very effective one." [...] Former war correspondent Gotham Chopra said that he understands [...] "the instinctive backlash (really it’s irritation)" [...] towards the film and the campaign, but [...] "there is enormous value in the fact that <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> talking today about genocide in Africa that were mostly unaware of it yesterday." [...] Jane Bussmann, author of a 2009 book about Kony and the President of Uganda Yoweri Museveni, compared the campaign favorably to the [...] "culture of charity-as-industry" [...] as [...] "at least Kony2012 linked suffering to perpetrators, and urged the young American audience it's aimed at to contact a politician." [...] Matthew Green, author of a 2008 book about Kony and the LRA conflict, The Wizard of the Nile, wrote that IC had [...] "achieved more with their 30-minute video than battalions of diplomats, NGO workers and journalists have since the conflict began 26 years ago." ...|$|E

2500|$|Suárez {{was given}} a {{worldwide}} football ban from all football-related activities totalling four months, plus nine international matches, {{as well as a}} fine of £66k; the ruling meant that, in addition to being banned from playing competitive football, he could neither train with his teammates or enter a football stadium; as the ban was effective immediately, Suárez could no longer participate in the World Cup. The chair of the committee, Claudio Sulser, clarified afterwards how the ruling came to be given: [...] "Such behaviour cannot be tolerated on any football pitch, and in particular not at a World Cup when the eyes of <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> on the stars on the field.
