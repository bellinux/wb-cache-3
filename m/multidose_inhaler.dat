40|$|Asthma is {{a common}} disease in {{children}} living in low-income countries. Asthma is diagnosed in children, especially those aged over 2 years, who have wheezing episodes that improve after a bronchodilator is given (bronchodilator response test). Children are classified as having either intermittent or persistent asthma and treated according to {{the severity of the}} disease with either an inhaled bronchodilator (reliever) or a combination of an inhaled bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroid (controller). Treatment is best given by inhalation, and as children under 5 years cannot coordinate their breathing with the <b>multidose</b> <b>inhaler,</b> spacers are required. These can be made locally from plastic bottles. Care givers need to be educated about how to manage asthma and should receive a written management plan on the management of the child's asthma. Children should be examined to see if they are allergic to especially airborne allergens, and if these are present they should be removed from the environment. Adult smoking worsens childhood asthma, and care givers need to be given support with smoking cessation. Regular planned follow-up is needed to ensure that the asthma is well controlled and the lowest dose of inhaled corticosteroid is used. Inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids must become freely available and should be inexpensive in low-income countries in order to treat childhood asthma correctly. © 2005 The Union. Revie...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis randomized, placebo-controlled, evaluator-blind, five-way {{crossover}} study compared the equivalence {{in terms of}} FEV 1 response to single ascending cumulative doses of salbutamol (100 – 400 μg) from AirmaxTM, a new multidose dry powder inhaler, in comparison with placebo, the same dose from a standard pressurized metered dose inhaler (Ventolin®) or at double the dose from the dry powder inhalers Diskhaler® and Accuhaler®. Sixty-one adult asthmatic subjects with FEV 1 50 – 80 % predicted and ≥ 15 % increase in FEV 1 to salbutamol took part. Equivalence was declared if the 95 % CI for {{the ratio of the}} FEV 1 responses to the two treatments was within the range 90 – 111 %. Following the cumulative four doses, FEV 1 (l) changes pre-dose to the highest dose were: 2. 53 – 3. 31, 2. 47 – 3. 30, 2. 51 – 3. 35, 2. 52 – 3. 31 and 2. 57 – 2. 55 for AirmaxTM salbutamol, salbutamol Ventolin®, salbutamol Diskhaler®, salbutamol Accuhaler® and placebo, respectively. The 95 % CIs for the ratio of AirmaxTM salbutamol to each of the active devices were within ± 5 % demonstrating a 1 : 1 dose equivalence between AirmaxTM salbutamol and Ventolin® and a 1 : 2 dose equivalence between each of the other two salbutamol dry powder devices. Adverse events profiles were similar for all treatments. In conclusion, the novel <b>multidose</b> <b>inhaler</b> AirmaxTM salbutamol is as efficacious and safe as the pressurized metered dose inhaler without the need for co-ordinating actuation and inhalation and with the added benefit of a dose counter...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{specific}} {{attributes of}} inhaler devices can influence patient use, satisfaction and treatment compliance, and may ultimately impact on clinical outcomes {{in patients with}} {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). AIMS: To assess patient preference, satisfaction and critical inhaler technique errors with Genuair (a <b>multidose</b> <b>inhaler)</b> and Breezhaler (a single-dose inhaler) after 2 weeks of daily use. METHODS: Patients with COPD and moderate to severe airflow obstruction were randomised in a cross-over, open-label, multicentre study to consecutive once-daily inhalations of placebo via Genuair and Breezhaler, in addition to current COPD medication. The primary end point was the proportion of patients who preferred Genuair versus Breezhaler after 2 weeks (Patient Satisfaction and Preference Questionnaire). Other end points included overall satisfaction and correct use of the inhalers after 2 weeks, and willingness to continue with each device. RESULTS: Of the 128 patients enrolled, 127 were included in the safety population (male n= 91; mean age 67. 6 years). Of the 110 of the 123 patients in the intent-to-treat population who indicated an inhaler preference, statistically significantly more patients preferred Genuair than Breezhaler (72. 7 vs. 27. 3 %; P< 0. 001). Mean overall satisfaction scores were also greater for Genuair than for Breezhaler (5. 9 vs. 5. 3, respectively; P< 0. 001). After 2 weeks, there was no statistically significant difference in the number of patients who made ⩾ 1 critical inhaler technique error with Breezhaler than with Genuair (7. 3 vs. 3. 3 %, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Patient overall preference and satisfaction was significantly higher with Genuair compared with Breezhaler. The proportion of patients making critical inhaler technique errors was low with Genuair and Breezhaler. The study was funded by Almirall S. A., Barcelona, Spain, and Forest Laboratories LLC, a subsidiary of Actavis PLC, New York, USA. Medical writing support was funded by Almirall S. A., Barcelona, Spain...|$|E

40|$|Inhaled {{corticosteroids}} and bronchodilators, {{which are}} pivotal {{to the management}} of respiratory diseases, are delivered by numerous devices, including pressurized metered-dose inhalers and dry-powder inhalers. However, patient adherence to these medications is suboptimal and incorrect inhaler technique is endemic, meaning that insufficient drug quantities are frequently delivered to the lungs. Genuair® (Almirall SA, Spain) is a novel, breath-actuated, <b>multidose</b> dry-powder <b>inhaler</b> designed to achieve reliable and effective delivery of inhaled medicines – including aclidinium bromide – to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In addition to describing Genuair’s design, which incorporates multiple feedback mechanisms in order to confirm effective medication uptake, this article discusses the performance characteristics of the inhaler, its efficiency in terms of drug deposition {{and the results of}} recent patient preference and satisfaction studies...|$|R
40|$|Metered dose <b>inhalers</b> (MDI) and <b>multidose</b> powder <b>inhalers</b> (MPDI) are {{commonly}} used {{for the treatment of}} chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and asthma. Currently, analytical tools to monitor particle/particle and particle/surface interaction within MDI and MPDI at the macro-scale do not exist. A simple tool capable of measuring such interactions would ultimately enable quality control of MDI and MDPI, producing remarkable benefits for the pharmaceutical industry and the users of inhalers. In this paper, we have investigated whether a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) could become such a tool. A QCM was used to measure particle/particle and particle/surface interactions on the macroscale, by additions of small amounts of MDPI components, in the powder form into a gas stream. The subsequent interactions with materials {{on the surface of the}} QCM sensor were analyzed. Following this, the sensor was used to measure fluticasone propionate, a typical MDI active ingredient, in a pressurized gas system to assess its interactions with different surfaces under conditions mimicking the manufacturing process. In both types of experiments the QCM was capable of discriminating interactions of different components and surfaces. The results have demonstrated that the QCM is a suitable platform for monitoring macro-scale interactions and could possibly become a tool for quality control of inhalers...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{efficacy}} of dry powder inhalers {{depends on the}} patient's inspiratory flow. Drug delivery from the Turbohaler (Turbuhaler in some countries), a <b>multidose</b> powder <b>inhaler,</b> is optimal at flows of > 40 l/min. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the peak inspiratory flow that can be generated by asthmatic patients through the budesonide Turbohaler (PIFTBH) during maintenance treatment at home. METHODS: Thirty asthmatic patients, consecutively recruited from the outpatient clinic, inhaled their maintenance dose of 800 (n = 16) or 1600 micrograms/day (n = 14) for two months or one month, respectively. The Turbohaler was connected to a modified Vitalograph Compact installed at home to obtain printed PIFTBH values for all inhalations. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) was measured twice daily. RESULTS: Flows were remarkably constant with individual mean PIFTBH values ranging from 55 l/min to 95 l/min. Only 13 of the 5248 PIFTBH recordings taken at home (three patients) were 30 l/min. Weekly mean morning PEF values ranged from 114 l/min to 733 l/min. PIFTBH values could not be accurately predicted from lung function parameters in individual patients. CONCLUSIONS: In a group of stable asthmatic patients inspiratory flow rates rarely fell below the 40 l/min needed to operate a Turbohaler...|$|R

40|$|AbstractLittle {{is known}} about the shot potency and dose {{consistency}} of many of the inhalers in common use, and until recently there has been little consensus over the best way to evaluate these parameters. Since marked effects can be achieved with the inhaled route, more information is needed about the dosing characteristics of all available inhalers. As there are now two multidoes powder inhalers available in the U. K. capable of supplying 1 month or more of treatment, {{this study was designed to}} compare the delivery characteristics of these two dry powder inhalers delivering glucocorticosteroids. The method used was in vitro analysis of the emitted dose and fine particle fraction throughout the life of five of each type of device. The <b>multidose</b> powder <b>inhaler</b> delivered between 87 and 93 % of the label claim dosage, whilst the reservoir device delivered 40 – 58 %. There was no fall off of shot potency towards the end of either device's life. Fine particle fraction for the multidose and reservoir systems, was 21 and 18 %, respectively, at 601 min− 1 flow, but fell to 16 and 6 % at 28 · 31 min− 1. In conclusion, there were statistically significant differences (P< 0 · 0001) in the drug emission of both dose and fine particle fraction of these two powder inhalers...|$|R

MethodsPatients with FEV 1 ≤ 70 % predicted, FEV 1 /FVC≤ 70 % and a smoking history of > 10 pack-years received tiotropium once daily via Respimat® (5 μg) and HandiHaler® (18 μg) for 4 weeks each in a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, two-way crossover study. Lung function, adverse events, pharmacokinetics and safety were assessed. ResultsOf 184 patients screened, 134 were evaluable. The trough FEV 1 response on Day 29 showed Respimat® to be non-inferior to HandiHaler® (mean treatment difference, 0. 008 L; 95 % CI, − 0. 009 to + 0. 024 L; p< 0. 001). Peak and average FEV 1 and FVC responses on Day 1 and Day 29 were very similar for the two treatments. Tiotropium plasma levels and excretion kinetics showed a similar profile of systemic exposure for the two formulations of tiotropium. Adverse events were reported by similar numbers of patients on each treatment, i. e. 27. 9 and 30. 6 % in the Respimat® and HandiHaler® groups, respectively. ConclusionsIn Japanese patients with COPD, tiotropium Respimat® 5 μg and tiotropium HandiHaler® 18 μg showed a similar profile of efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe Genuair® inhaler {{is a new}} <b>multidose</b> {{dry powder}} <b>inhaler</b> for the {{delivery}} of aclidinium bromide – a novel, long-acting, muscarinic antagonist in development {{for the treatment of}} chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The primary aim {{of this study was to}} assess the inspiratory flow characteristics through Genuair® in patients with moderate or severe COPD. Using a three-period cross-over design, 48 patients were randomised to inhale placebo powder through Genuair®, HandiHaler® A (slow, deep inhalation as per manufacturer's instructions) or HandiHaler® B (fast, forceful inhalation). Three measurements of peak inspiratory flow (PIF), 10 min apart, were recorded for each method of administration. The highest and average PIFs for the three attempts (mean±standard deviation) generated through the Genuair® inhaler were 97. 7 ± 15. 7 and 92. 0 ± 15. 4 L/min, respectively. Furthermore, 97 % of inhalations with the Genuair® inhaler were successful (activation of trigger threshold mechanism) and optimal (PIF≥ 45 L/min). The highest and average PIFs generated through HandiHaler® A and B were significantly lower than with the Genuair® inhaler. In conclusion, patients with moderate or severe COPD were able to generate sufficient inspiratory airflow through the Genuair® inhaler to reliably inhale the full dose and reset the inhaler...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe MAGhaler (Mundipharma GmbH) is a <b>multidose</b> {{dry powder}} <b>inhaler</b> (DPI) {{containing}} a novel formulation of drug and lactose compacted by an isostatic pressing technique (GGU GmbH). On actuation, a precise dose is metered from a compacted ring-shaped drug tablet. In this study, the lung deposition of salbutamol from this device has been assessed. Ten healthy non-smoking subjects completed a two-way cross-over study, assessing the pulmonary deposition of salbutamol (200 μg) from the MAGhaler at high (60 l/min) and low (30 l/min) peak inhaled flow rates (PIFRs), representing maximal and sub-maximal inspiratory efforts. The formulation was radiolabelled with 99 mTc, and lung and oropharyngeal depositions were quantified by gamma scintigraphy. The mean (SD) % of the delivered dose {{deposited in the}} lungs was 26. 4 (4. 3) % at 60 l/min and 21. 1 (5. 1) % at 30 l/min (P< 0. 05), corresponding to mean lung depositions of 52. 8 and 42. 2 μg salbutamol, respectively. The distribution of drug within different lung regions did not vary significantly with inhaled flow rate. The data provided proof of concept for the novel inhaler device and the innovative drug formulation. In comparison with previous deposition data obtained with other DPIs, the lung deposition was relatively high, relatively reproducible (coefficient of variation 16 % at 60 l/min) and relatively insensitive to the change in peak inhaled flow rate...|$|R
