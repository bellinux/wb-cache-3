The job was too {{monotonous}} to engage her for long, {{and after a}} few months she found a post in the drapery department of the Walton Road Co-operative store. At her mother's insistence she {{became a member of the}} Shopworkers' Union. Meanwhile, she attended classes run by the Workers' Educational Association and the Plebs' League: [...] "They told <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> capitalists controlled money, business and the land, and... hung on to them".|$|E

[...] He also scored a No.12 hit in 1972 with a version of Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show's pop hit [...] "Sylvia's Mother", written by Shel Silverstein.|$|E
2500|$|He {{also found}} a {{striking}} contrast with other churches in the common attribution of responsibility for conversion to [...] "a spiritual guide ... the person who acted as the intermediary with the Watchtower movement and who supervised the initial process of learning and reforming". Beckford cited an interview [...] "representative of many" [...] in which a convert recalled initially resisting the Watch Tower Society's teachings until he was [...] "talked into making a serious study of the scriptures ... I had plenty of objections and was sure the Witnesses were wrong, but (the Witness leading the personal Bible study sessions) showed <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> facts of the Bible could not be faulted".|$|E

2500|$|He sailed for India on 20 September 1882, {{and arrived}} in Bombay on 18 October. He {{described}} this moment years later: [...] "So, at sixteen years and nine months, but looking {{four or five}} years older, and adorned with real whiskers which the scandalised Mother abolished within one hour of beholding, I found myself at Bombay where I was born, moving among sights and smells that made me deliver in the vernacular sentences whose meaning I knew not. Other Indian-born boys have told <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> same thing happened to them." [...] This arrival changed Kipling, as he explains: [...] "There were yet three or four days’ rail to Lahore, where my people lived. After these, my English years fell away, nor ever, I think, came back in full strength".|$|E
2500|$|Green Day: Rock Band was {{generally}} well received by video game critics. Many critics noted the game follows the previous dedication to presentation, audio, and playability that {{were seen in}} The Beatles: Rock Band, though some believed it followed the formula too well to make it indistinguishable from the previous titles. Jack DeVries of IGN {{could not think of}} any easy way to identify the game from other Rock Band titles; [...] "People kept asking <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> game was and all I could think to say was 'It's Green Day: Rock Band.'" [...] Ben Kuchera of Ars Technica called the game [...] "paint by numbers rocking", commenting that the feature set is essentially the same as The Beatles. Patrick Klepek of G4TV stated the game was [...] "not as ambitious as The Beatles" [...] but still came to help him appreciate the band more.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the aphorisms which conclude Dialectic of Enlightenment, Adorno put together a collection of aphorisms in honor of Horkheimer's fiftieth birthday that would later be published as Minima Moralia: Reflections from Damaged Life. These fragmentary writings, inspired by a renewed reading of Nietzsche, treated issues like emigration, totalitarianism, and individuality, as well as everyday matters such as giving presents, dwelling and the impossibility of love. In California, Adorno made the acquaintance of Charlie Chaplin and became friends with Fritz Lang and Hanns Eisler, with whom he completed a study of film music in 1944. In this study, the authors pushed for the greater usage of avant-garde music in film, urging that music be used to supplement, not simply accompany, the visual aspect of films. Additionally, Adorno assisted Thomas Mann on his novel Doctor Faustus after the latter asked for his help. [...] "Would you be willing," [...] Mann wrote, [...] "to think through with <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> work—I mean Leverkühn's work—might look; how you would do it {{if you were in}} league with the Devil?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Unionists criticised the decision. Martin Smyth said, [...] "We {{are told}} that the two {{communities}} have to live together. We had a classic illustration of a name that brought the two communities together – Londonderry. 'London' indicates the British tradition and 'Derry' the Irish tradition. But the Government decided {{to do away with}} 'London' {{in the name of the}} Council." [...] William Ross said, [...] "Derry has never been used as the name of the city or of the island of Londonderry except as a shortened version of a longer name. The name was Derry Columbkille for centuries. It was Londonderry for centuries. Before that it was Derry Calgach [...] Those who sought the change sought it for no good reason. Their aim was to open a door. [...] It is beyond <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>the</b> name Derry city council will be separated from the concept of Londonderry city in the public mind. Everyone in Northern Ireland knows that the Republican elements in Londonderry city will ignore the name as they have always done. They now have a lever to put up Derry city right across the board. [...] People in Northern Ireland see it as an anti-British move by the most extreme Republican movements in Londonderry and the rest of Northern Ireland." ...|$|E
