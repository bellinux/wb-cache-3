40|$|The use of enzyme often implicates a {{stabilization}} {{to limit}} loss of activity and a suitable dry formulation to simplify handling. Freeze drying and spray drying are two classic methods but when complex systems are studied, it becomes {{difficult to achieve}} a correct formulation. In this work, the realization of a dry microbead containing a <b>multienzymatic</b> <b>system</b> (2 enzymes, 2 substrates) is presented. The lactoperoxidase system associated with an enzymatic hydrogen peroxide generator {{was chosen as the}} model. The microbead, made by spray drying and spray coating, was characterized in terms of size, shape, chemical structure, flow ability, encapsulation efficiency and antimicrobial activity. Different compositions of the coat were tested, as well as their influence on the bead properties...|$|E

The production of cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes was studied under solid-state cultivation (SSC). SSC in a laboratory horizontal bioreactor using the optimized medium, WS and BG in the ratio 1 : 1 and initial moisture level 61. 51 %, allowed the large scale production of the <b>multienzymatic</b> <b>system.</b> Similar yields with those from flasks experiments, as high as 1073, 56, 4. 2, 1. 6, 3. 1, 5. 7 and 0. 52 U g(- 1) carbon source of xylanase, endoglucanase, cellobiohydrolase, beta-glucosidase, alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase, acetyl esterase and feruloyl esterase, respectively, were obtained. Chromogenic (fluorogenic) 4 -methylumbelliferyl substrates were used to characterize the major activities of the multienzyme component, after the separation by isoelectric focusing (IEF) electrophoresis. Alkali pre-treated BG was used for ethanol production. A yield of about 74 g of ethanol kg(- 1) dry BG (5, 6 g L- 1) was obtained under optimum conditions (aeration 0. 1 vvm, pre-treatment with 1 g NaOH 10 g(- 1) dry BG). (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In {{a search}} for strains {{producing}} biocides with {{a wide spectrum of}} activity, a new strain was isolated. This strain was taxonomically characterized as Streptomyces rochei F 20, and the chemical structure of the bioactive product extracted from its fermentation broth was determined to be a mixture of streptothricins. From a genomic library of the producer strain prepared in the heterologous host Streptomyces lividans, a 7. 2 -kb DNA fragment which conferred resistance to the antibiotic was isolated. DNA sequencing of 5. 2 kb from the cloned fragment revealed five open reading frames (ORFs) such that ORF 1, - 2, - 3, and - 4 were transcribed in the same direction while ORF 5 was convergently arranged. The deduced product of ORF 1 strongly resembled those of genes involved in peptide formation by a nonribosomal mechanism; the ORF 2 product strongly resembled that of mphA and mphB isolated from Escherichia coli, which determines resistance to several macrolides by a macrolide 2 '-phosphotransferase activity; the ORF 3 product had similarities with several hydrolases; and the ORF 5 product strongly resembled streptothricin acetyltransferases from different gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. ORF 5 was shown to be responsible for acetyl coenzyme A-dependent streptothricin acetylation. No similarities in the databases for the ORF 4 product were found. Unlike other peptide synthases, that for streptothricin biosynthesis was arranged as a <b>multienzymatic</b> <b>system</b> rather than a multifunctional protein. Insertional inactivation of ORF 1 and ORF 2 (and to a lesser degree, of ORF 3) abolishes antibiotic biosynthesis, suggesting their involvement in the streptothricin biosynthetic pathway...|$|E

The resulting nanocomposites were able to perform a sequence of oxidation and aldol coupling reactions, which transformed short chain alcohols into longer chain molecules. The process takes place at low temperatures, but requires additional enzyme (catalase) to prevent inactivation of the catalyst.

The surprising synthetic efficiency of biological systems is {{allowed by the}} combination of multiple processes catalyzed by enzymes working sequentially. In this sense, biocatalysis tries to reproduce nature's synthetic strategies to perform the synthesis of different organic compounds using natural catalysts such as cells or enzymes. Nowadays, the use of <b>multienzymatic</b> <b>systems</b> in biocatalysis is becoming a habitual strategy for the synthesis of organic compounds {{that leads to the}} realization of complex synthetic schemes.

40|$|In vitro <b>multienzymatic</b> bioreaction <b>systems</b> are {{attracting}} increasing {{attention for}} the development of bioproduction systems. The de-coupling of the biocatalytic pathway from the cellular machinery aimed at growth and survival allows achievement of high product yields and thus reduces byproduct or waste generation. Additionally, the use of several enzymes allows the realization of much more complex synthetic schemes, thus expanding the chemical diversity of synthetic compounds with new chemical properties or bioactivities. This chapter provides a survey of in vitro <b>multienzymatic</b> bioreaction <b>systems</b> used for biosynthesis, discusses process design aspects for the technical realization of multienzymatic bioreactions, highlights advantages and recent developments in using multienzyme microreactors, and finally reviews examples and strategies of the co-immobilization of multienzymes in nano/microsized materials...|$|R
40|$|Activity and {{functional}} {{significance of the}} renal kallikrein-kinin-system in polycystic kidney disease of the rat. BackgroundThe kallikrein-kinin-system is a complex <b>multienzymatic</b> <b>system</b> that has been implicated in the control of systemic blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate, and proteinuria. The present study investigated its functional role in rat polycystic kidney disease (PKD), which is characterized by progressive renal failure and proteinuria {{in the absence of}} systemic hypertension and stimulated renin-angiotensin-system. MethodsKallikrein and bradykinin levels were measured in plasma and urine of rats with polycystic kidneys and compared to non-affected controls (SD) and rats with reduced renal mass. The functional relevance of the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) was assessed by the effects of a short-term treatment with either a selective bradykinin (BK) B 1 -receptor antagonist (des-Arg 9 -[Leu 8]-BK), a B 2 -receptor antagonist (HOE 140), an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ramipril), or an angiotensin II-receptor blocker (HR 720) on systemic and renal parameters. ResultsUrine levels of kallikrein were increased threefold in 9 -month-old PKD, and BK excretion was increased tenfold in 3 -month and 30 -fold in 9 -month-old PKD compared to age-matched SD rats. Blood pressure in 9 -month-old PKD rats was decreased to the same degree by ramipril and HR 720. In contrast, only ramipril and HOE 140 significantly reduced proteinuria and albuminuria, independent from creatinine clearance. This effect was accompanied by an increased excretion of bradykinin. The B 1 receptor antagonist had no influence on functional renal parameters. ConclusionsThe present study demonstrates an age-dependent activation of the renal KKS in rats with polycystic kidney disease. The bradykinin B 2 -receptor is involved in the pathogenesis of proteinuria, independent from systemic blood pressure or creatinine clearance. The antiproteinuric effect of ramipril in this model is angiotensin II-independent and related to its influence on the renal KKS...|$|E
40|$|Green sulfur {{bacteria}} are photolithotrophs that use inorganic sulfur compounds as electron donors for photosynthesis. Elemental, solid sulfur {{is one of}} the electron donors used. Sulfur is produced by green sulfur bacteria during the oxidation of sulfide to sulfate, and during the oxidation of thiosulfate to sulfur and sulfate. Green sulfur bacteria have been known for long, and the genomes of 12 strains have been sequenced. Yet, {{it is not clear how}} green sulfur bacteria can access elemental sulfur, which is practically insoluble at the temperatures at which most of them grow. The present work has been done using pure cultures of the mesophilic strain Chlorobaculum parvum DSM 263. By studying the dynamics of inorganic sulfur compounds in growing cultures of Cla. parvum DSM 263, it was shown that the sulfur produced during thiosulfate oxidative disproportionation can be either oxidized immediately to sulfate, or released outside the cells. Extracellular sulfur oxidation needs a dedicated system, which is not synthesised in the presence of thiosulfate. Experiments conducted at low light intensities revealed that thiosulfate is not consumed exclusively via the Sox <b>multienzymatic</b> <b>system,</b> known thus far as the only thiosulfate oxidizing system present in green sulfur bacteria. It is not clear yet if this additional pathway for thiosulfate consumption allows strain DSM 263 to obtain electrons for thiosulfate, or if it is used by bacteria to consume the reducing power that cells might have in excess. Physiological studies conducted on Cla. parvum DSM 263 fed with sulfur furnished evidence that the oxidation of elemental sulfur to sulfate is accompanied by the formation of yet unidentified sulfur compound(s). Similarly to what commented for thiosulfate consumption, these compounds could be intermediates in the oxidation of sulfur to sulfate, or could be side products of sulfur consumption. Essential elements for the utilisation of elemental sulfur were shown to be present in the membranes of Cla. parvum DSM 263. Differential membrane proteomic studies were thus performed on cells of Cla. parvum DSM 263 grown on sulfur or on sulfide. Seven proteins were found to be overexpressed in sulfuric conditions, revealing that bacteria do possess different proteomic equipment for oxidizing the insoluble sulfur rather than the soluble sulfide. Identification of these overexpressed proteins and of their interaction partners will probably help revealing the cellular apparatus of extracellular solid sulfur mobilization...|$|E
40|$|Phylloquinone is a {{compound}} {{present in all}} plants serving as cofactor for photosystem I mediated electron transport during photosynthesis. This work reports on the identification and analysis of several Arabidopsis thaliana phylloquinone absence (pha) and isochorismate synthase (ics) mutants impaired in the biosynthesis of PhQ (vitamin K 1). Besides the complete lack of PhQ, these plants show a typical phenotype characterized by seedling lethality, photosynthetic defects specifically related to impaired photosystem I accumulation/activity to 5 - 15 % of wild-type levels and partial recovery of 15 % PhQ content and 50 - 70 % PSI accumulation/activity after feeding with the metabolic precursor of vitamin K 1, 1, 4 -dihydroxy- 2 -naphthoate. Map-based localization of the mutated allele in the pha plants identified a new gene, called PHYLLO. It consists of a fusion of four previously individual eubacterial genes, menF, menD, menC, and menH, required for the biosynthesis of the photosynthetic phylloquinone in cyanobacteria and the respiratory menaquinone in eubacteria. The fact that homologous men genes still reside as polycistronic units in plastomes of red algae and in eubacterial chromosomes strongly suggests that PHYLLO derived from an operon present in the proto-organelle precursor of all plastids. The principle architecture of the PHYLLO locus is conserved in the nuclear genomes of plants and the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, indicating that selective forces have been acting to maintain the cluster structure {{in the form of}} a gene fusion, presumably as an adaptation of an multifunctional association of four enzymatic activities already pre-existing in the chloroplast. In line with this finding, the data present in this work suggest that the PHYLLO composite product is part of a metabolon for the biosynthesis of phylloquinone. The menF module of PHYLLO in Chlamydomonas, encoding the isochorismate synthase activity, is full-length, whereas in higher plants this module surprisingly lacks the functional 3 ’ part, uncovering a recent gene splitting event during evolution. Such a gene fission event, which resulted in inactivation of the encoded ICS enzymatic activity from PHYLLO, must have been preceded by establishment of a second functional copy of the menF gene. Accordingly, double-knockouts of the ICS 1 and ICS 2 genes in Arabidopsis analysed during this work, were unable to synthesize PhQ, demonstrating that the activity of the menF module of PHYLLO has been replaced after the splitting of the 3 ’-region by at least one more ICS gene present in genomes of higher plants. The fact that ICS 1 is also required for salicylic acid biosynthesis in Arabidopsis, establishes a metabolic link between photosynthesis and systemic acquired resistance. Therefore, gene fusion, duplication and fission events adapted a eubacterial <b>multienzymatic</b> <b>system</b> to the metabolic requirements of plants. Despite the essential function of PhQ for PSI stability and plant viability, analyses of ics heterozygous knockout plants, as well as complementation of the pha mutants by NA feeding and transgenic forms of PHYLLO demonstrate that the bulk of cellular phylloquinone is not associated with photosystem I, opening the possibility for additional functions of vitamin K 1 in plant cell membranes...|$|E

40|$|Dissertação de mestrado, Engenharia Biológica, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Universidade do Algarve; Instituto de Tecnologia Química e Biológica António Xavier, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, 2015 Lignin, after cellulose, is {{the most}} {{abundant}} organic polymer on Earth and has vital functions as a constituent of plant cell walls including structural resistance and protection against pathogens and hydrolysis. Notwithstanding lignin degradation by microbes represents a key-step in {{the completion of the}} carbon cycle in land ecosystems. The most well-known microorganisms involved in lignin degradation are fungi using oxidoreductases such as laccases, high redox peroxidases and peroxide forming enzymes. Bacterial lignin degradation is much less characterized and might allow the development of new cost-affordable bioprocesses for lignin depolymerisation, considering the relative easiness of bacterial enzyme production and engineering systems. This work focuses on in silico screening, cloning, expression and characterisation of bacterial lignin-degrading auxiliary enzymes, more specifically, H 2 O 2 forming enzymes such as aryl-alcohol oxidase, pyranose- 2 -oxidases, glyoxal oxidases or galactose oxidases with the intent to advance the scope of our understanding of lignin degradation in bacteria. Here we report the successful cloning of the first bacterial pyranose- 2 -oxidase and also the heterologous cloning, production and preliminary biochemical characterization of a bacterial galactose oxidase, both from Arthrobacter siccitolerans. The recombinant pyranose oxidase revealed activity towards D-glucose and the typical ultra-violet/visible spectrum of a flavoenzyme. The recombinant galactose oxidase showed an optimal temperature between 25 - 35 °C and an optimal pH of 8. 0. The A. siccitolerans galactose oxidase is able to oxidize the typical substrates such as D-galactose, D-raffinose, lactose and glycerol, but also exhibited activity towards L-arabinose which has not been reported for other galactose oxidases. It is expected that this work will open new perspectives for the understanding of the structure-function relationships of bacterial hydrogen peroxide producing enzymes and optimization of <b>multienzymatic</b> <b>systems,</b> along with bacterial dye-decolorizing peroxidases and bacterial laccases, recently identified in the laboratory, for the set-up of lignin depolymerisation and valorisation...|$|R
