5|$|Ben Tudhope (born 13 December 1999) is an Australian Paralympian who {{competed in}} para-snowboard cross at the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi. His {{selection}} {{at the age}} of 14 <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> became Australia's youngest Winter Paralympian, replacing Michael Milton. He was the youngest competitor at the 2014 Winter Paralympic Games from any country.|$|E
5|$|Hogg {{became a}} {{barrister}} and met Jane Williams, {{who had become}} {{a close friend of}} Percy Shelley's shortly before the poet's death. Jane became Hogg's common-law wife and they had two children together. The family settled in London, although Hogg's legal career <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> often had to travel away from home.|$|E
5|$|Morris {{followed}} his effort in Bristol with two half centuries, 51 and 54 not {{out in the}} drawn Third Test. He then struck 108 against Middlesex in a tour match. Morris' century <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had amassed 504 runs in just over a week of cricket.|$|E
50|$|Alves then {{returned}} to Rio Ave, but a registration error <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> neither <b>he</b> nor Ângelo Meneses could take part in Nuno Espírito Santo's team.|$|R
60|$|Andrew thought Rankine <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> if <b>he</b> {{felt certain}} <b>that</b> {{messages}} were sent from the wreck, {{he would have}} brought some pressure to bear on him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn’t say that," [...] {{said the}} captain, eagerly. [...] "If anything, {{he is too}} open-handed. What I <b>meant</b> was <b>that</b> <b>he</b> isn’t lazy." ...|$|R
5|$|Nash {{was officially}} {{appointed}} Captain/Coach of Camberwell Cricket Club on 19 September 1938 and his debut {{for the club}} {{in the summer of}} 1938–1939 <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was the first person to}} be paid for playing grade cricket in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Some have {{interpreted}} Bahá'u'lláh's writing style {{to conclude that}} Bahá'u'lláh had claimed divinity. Bahá'u'lláh, however, states himself that the essence of God will never descend into the human world. Statements where Bahá'u'lláh speaks with the voice of God are <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is not actually God, but that he is speaking with the attributes of God.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Woodfull {{was promoted}} to open and his consistent performances in all conditions <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was to play there {{for the rest of}} his career. Between 1922 and 1926, he accumulated over 3,000 first-class runs at an average of 67.|$|E
50|$|The patient asked Dr Frenkel {{about the}} test and was told what it <b>meant</b> and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not 'pass' the test. Several months later, on re-examination, the patient showed {{extraordinary}} improvement in coordination.|$|R
60|$|Discovery of {{the plot}} <b>meant</b> to Dale <b>that</b> <b>he</b> must hurry down to Pine.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I asked him, mamma. Did you {{not hear}} me? I {{could not say}} the word plainer,--but I asked him whether <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> sin. <b>He</b> must have known, {{and he would not}} answer me. And he spoke of my--transgression. Mamma, if <b>he</b> {{believed}} <b>that,</b> <b>he</b> would not let me come back at all." ...|$|R
5|$|Although Hitler had {{terminated}} his Austrian {{citizenship in}} 1925, {{he did not}} acquire German citizenship for almost seven years. This <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was stateless, legally unable to run for public office, and still faced the risk of deportation. On 25 February 1932, the interior minister of Brunswick, Dietrich Klagges, {{who was a member}} of the NSDAP, appointed Hitler as administrator for the state's delegation to the Reichsrat in Berlin, making Hitler a citizen of Brunswick, and thus of Germany.|$|E
5|$|Although a professional—captains at {{the time}} were almost {{exclusively}} amateurs—the respect in which Hobbs was held <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was accepted as a captain. Many, but not all, critics considered him a competent tactician and leader. He regularly led the Players team against the Gentlemen and sometimes at Surrey in the absence of Percy Fender, but he was a reluctant captain. He disliked the responsibility and decision-making of leadership, and rarely even offered tactical advice.|$|E
5|$|As the Emperor's {{personal}} taster, Halotus would accompany Claudius {{to every}} banquet and dinner and as chief steward, {{he would have}} been with Claudius and his family {{for the majority of the}} time. Thus he could have formed a relationship with Agrippina the Younger, suggesting the possibility of their collaboration in poisoning Claudius. It also <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would have been aware of details such as the Emperor's food preferences, his meal times and his schedule, making it easier for him to commit the murder.|$|E
5000|$|The first-known {{family member}} {{to bear the}} surname [...] "Kingsbury" [...] was Adam de Kingsbury,' who was born about 1240 in Kingsbury, Warwickshire. His name <b>meant</b> only <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was from the {{locality}} of Kingsbury, before surnames were widely used.|$|R
50|$|What Bernstein <b>meant</b> was <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{believed}} <b>that</b> Marx {{was wrong}} in assuming that the capitalist economy would collapse {{as a result of}} its internal contradictions, as by the mid-1890s there was little evidence of such internal contradictions causing this to capitalism.|$|R
60|$|Tom {{knew very}} well what <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> by <b>that,</b> so <b>he</b> laid down the pipes, {{and went back to}} the farmer's house.|$|R
5|$|C. L. R. James {{believes}} that St Hill planned to play professional cricket in England around this point, but his {{failure in the}} trial matches <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was not selected to tour England with the West Indies team in 1923. James records how upset St Hill's supporters were by his omission and they believed the West Indian selectors feared a black batsman being successful in England. He also describes St Hill became more single-minded and less willing to moderate his approach after this decision.|$|E
5|$|Chrysippus was a {{prolific}} writer. He {{is said to}} rarely have gone without writing 500 lines a day and he composed more than 705 works. His desire to be comprehensive <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would take both sides of an argument and his opponents accused him of filling his books with the quotations of others. He was considered diffuse and obscure in his utterances and careless in his style, but his abilities were highly regarded, {{and he came to}} be seen as a preeminent authority for the school.|$|E
5|$|Consecutive points {{finishes}} in Hungary and Italy saw Webber climb to ninth in the drivers' standings with a 5-point margin over Button. He {{was unable to}} hold on to this position however, after one too many laps on dry tyres saw him spin out from the lead of the , and a disappointing 11th-place result in Japan. These <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had finished on equal points with Button but lost out on a countback.|$|E
6000|$|In saying {{above that}} Geoffroy of Eu {{returned}} thanks in the Cathedral for its completion, I <b>meant</b> only <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had brought {{at least the}} choir into condition for service: [...] "Jusqu'aux voûtes" [...] {{may or may not}} mean that the vaulting was closed.] ...|$|R
50|$|There is {{some minor}} {{argument}} on whether Saccheri really <b>meant</b> <b>that,</b> as <b>he</b> published {{his work in}} the final year of his life, came extremely close to discovering non-Euclidean geometry and was a logician. Some believe Saccheri concluded as he did only to avoid the criticism that might come from seemingly-illogical aspects of hyperbolic geometry.|$|R
60|$|Whitefoot was {{beginning}} to feel quite at home. He would have been wholly contented but for one thing,--he had no well-filled storehouse. This <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> each day <b>he</b> must hunt for his food.|$|R
5|$|For Cagney's next film, he {{traveled}} to Ireland for Shake Hands with the Devil, directed by Michael Anderson. Cagney had hoped {{to spend some time}} tracing his Irish ancestry, but time constraints and poor weather <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was unable to do so. The overriding message of violence inevitably leading to more violence attracted Cagney to the role of an Irish Republican Army commander, and resulted in what some critics would regard as the finest performance of his final years.|$|E
5|$|Francesco Toldo's {{impressive}} {{performances at}} Euro 2000 <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> retained {{his place in}} the first team for the beginning of Italy's 2002 World Cup qualifying campaign. In spite of heavy competition from Toldo, Buffon regained the starting goalkeeping spot for the fourth match of the qualification series, away to Romania, and was the starting goalkeeper for the remaining four matches under Giovanni Trapattoni as Italy qualified with an unbeaten record.|$|E
5|$|Herrmann {{realized}} that musicians slated {{to play his}} music were hired for individual unique sessions; {{there was no need}} to write for existing ensembles. This <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was free to score for unusual combinations of instruments, even instruments that are not commonly heard. In the opening sequence, for example, the tour of Kane's estate Xanadu, Herrmann introduces a recurring leitmotiv played by low woodwinds, including a quartet of alto flutes.|$|E
60|$|I could {{scarcely}} believe <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> it; <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was going away without another word, {{at what was}} really this priest's unspoken bidding. But it was so. From that moment, the fear of Father Adrian which {{had grown up in}} my heart leaped into a new strength. I was angry, and full of resistance.|$|R
50|$|Tom {{began the}} year {{targeting}} the British Rally Championship with the JRM team running {{him in a}} Mitsubishi Lancer EvolutionX Group N car. He was second on the season opener, the Sunseeker Rally but an accident on the Bulldog followed by car failure on the Jim Clark <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> realistically, <b>he</b> {{was out of the}} running.|$|R
5000|$|For 2010 and 2011 season's he {{continued}} to race with his own team in South America Formula 3 {{and was able to}} get another 2 wins (at Londrina in 2010 and Rio de Janeiro in 2011) and more podiums finishes, but unfortunately poor reliability <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> again <b>he</b> would finish the championship way behind the main contenders [...]|$|R
5|$|Mehldau {{is married}} to Dutch jazz vocalist Fleurine, {{with whom he has}} {{recorded}} and toured. They met in 1997, and have three children. The eldest is a daughter who was born in 2001. Mehldau stated early in 2006 that family responsibilities <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was making shorter tours. As of 2010, he divided his non-touring time between living in Amsterdam and New York.|$|E
5|$|Of the First Test team, all bar Toshack scored {{multiple}} first-class {{centuries in}} their careers, and all averaged under 27.50 with the ball. As Bradman wanted all four spin techniques covered, {{as well as}} both left and right-arm seamers, this also <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could only have two fast bowlersLindwall and Milleras three positions were occupied by spinners and a fourth by Toshack, who was of medium pace.|$|E
5|$|On 28 June 2007, the {{day after}} Gordon Brown became Prime Minister, Miliband was sworn of the Privy Council and {{appointed}} Minister for the Cabinet Office and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, being promoted to the cabinet. This <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> and his brother, Foreign Secretary David Miliband, became the first brothers to serve in a British cabinet since Edward and Oliver Stanley in 1938. He was additionally given the task of drafting Labour's manifesto for the 2010 general election.|$|E
6000|$|I thought <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>that</b> while <b>he</b> {{ran down}} the rapids I should keep along the shore, {{and be ready to}} assist him from time to time, as I had done before; but as the walking would be very bad, I answered, [...] "I suppose you will go too fast for me, but I will try." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did not {{suppose he}} was a malefactor. I <b>meant,</b> <b>that</b> if <b>he</b> were a malefactor, your place {{would be in the}} prison beside him. My daughter, if the cross comes to you as a wife, you must carry it as a wife. You may say, `I will forsake my husband,' but you cannot cease to be a wife." ...|$|R
60|$|Campbell knew {{quite enough}} of the would-be cynical doctor, to {{understand}} what all <b>that</b> <b>meant.</b> <b>He</b> came up to Elsley.|$|R
