2500|$|Most {{cyprinids}} feed {{mainly on}} invertebrates and vegetation, {{probably due to}} the lack of teeth and stomach, but some species, like the asp, are predators that specialize in fish. [...] Many species, such as the ide, and the common rudd, prey on small fish when individuals become large enough. Even small species, such as the <b>moderlieschen,</b> are opportunistic predators that will eat larvae of the common frog in artificial circumstances.|$|E
5000|$|The {{common name}} <b>Moderlieschen</b> is of German origin. Although {{it looks like}} a proper word that can be {{approximately}} translated as [...] "mouldy Lizzy", it is actually a bowdlerized version of an older name which survives in parts of Germany as Mutterloseken. Literally meaning [...] "the little motherless one", this ultimately refers {{to the fact that the}} sticky eggs of the <b>moderlieschen</b> can withstand exposure to air for a remarkably long time. Deposited on water plants, they sometimes stick to the feet of ducks and similar birds and are carried by these to ephemeral ponds. Large numbers of young moderlieschens are thus sometimes encountered when such ponds dry up, and with no adult fish being present this gave rise to the belief that they were [...] "motherless".|$|E
50|$|Leucaspius delineatus, {{known as}} the sunbleak, belica or <b>moderlieschen</b> is a species of {{freshwater}} fish in the Cyprinidae family. It is currently the only species included in genus Leucaspius, whereas formerly others were included, which now have been moved to Ladigesocypris or Pseudophoxinus or merged with L. delineatus.|$|E
50|$|Fish species {{found in}} Ringsjön are European perch, carp bream, <b>moderlieschen,</b> {{northern}} pike, zander, common carp, burbot, common roach, rainbow trout, crucian carp, common rudd, common whitefish, tench, eel, and brown trout. Ringsjön {{has had an}} overpopulation of carp bream and common roach for a long time, leading to an increased algal bloom, and in 2005 work began on removing 80% of these species from the lake.|$|E

5000|$|... ==Flora and fauna== The {{plant life}} of the reserve is mostly forest (96.6%), both pine forest and mixed forest (spruce, aspen, basswood, black alder). The sandy soils are {{especially}} favorable for pine. The floodplain of the Moksha River also has oak and alder communities. Grasslands are mainly floodplain, upland little. Scientists for the reserve have recorded 788 species of vascular plants, 77 of moss, and 136 of lichens. [...] With extensive wetlands and forest, the reserve is known for scientific study of insects, of which over 1,500 species have been studied within the borders, and the inventory is far from complete. The animal {{life of the}} reserve reflects {{the richness of the}} wetlands in particular: 32 species of fish (including Tench, Northern pike, European perch, and <b>Moderlieschen)</b> are found, and 10 species of amphibians (newts, frogs, and toads, including the European fire-bellied toad. The reserves feature a variety of mammals that reflect the different ecozones meeting in the region: brown bear and moose of the European taiga, squirrels, moles and martens of the mixed deciduous forests. Scientists on the reserve have recorded 60 species of mammals. 216 species of birds have been recorded.|$|E
40|$|International audienceMyriophyllum alterniflorum D. C., an aquatic {{macrophyte}} {{native to}} north-European stream freshwaters, was found even in polluted environments from the Vienne river {{and its tributaries}} which are often loaded with anthropogenic copper in the Limousin region (France). Vitroplants of this species were reintroduced in degraded localities and the restoration was successful as insect larvae's, crawfishes, leeches and <b>moderlieschen</b> alevins were found in reintroduced macrophyte beds. Furthermore, the good in situ acclimation of the M. alterniflorum patches foresaw potential applications of biomonitoring. Indeed, this species {{is known to be}} heavy-metal tolerant and it appears as a good candidate to develop new plant biomarker models specific to pollution in stream environments as none were developed until now. Among ten physiological parameters studied during 35 days after in situ reintroduction, the photosynthetic pigments (chlorophylls a and b, and carotenoids) presented an excellent sensitivity to copper contamination. A strong correlation is obtained between pigment contents of M. alterniflorum and the copper water concentration. This allowed the establishment of models to estimate (i) the phytotoxicity of the heavy metal and (ii) the heavy-metal concentration from the pigment data. The accuracy of the models is limited to copper concentrations ranging from 0, 07 µg. l- 1 to 12, 60 µg. l- 1 hence offering many opportunities to apply this new method in a large quantity of European polluted stream waters while using expensive and complex analytical methodologies (e. g. ICP-MS). Owning biological and chemical information from this rapid and cost-effective approach, allows to develop environmental health programs to manage the heavy-metal load in stream ecosystems. Moreover, this study is a breakthrough in the biomonitoring of freshwaters as it leads to enhance environmental management program with the development of new biomarkers from freshwater macrophytes...|$|E
