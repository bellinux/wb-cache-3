Here we show that a network's large-scale topological organization and its local subgraph structure <b>mutually</b> <b>define</b> and predict each other, as confirmed by direct measurements in five well studied cellular networks. We also demonstrate the inherent existence of two distinct classes of subgraphs, and show that, in contrast to the low-density type II subgraphs, the highly abundant type I subgraphs cannot exist in isolation but must naturally aggregate into subgraph clusters. The identified topological framework may have important implications for our understanding of the origin and function of subgraphs in all complex networks. Comment: pape...|$|R

To answer this question, I discuss three families of accounts of legitimate authority: purely procedural, purely instrumental, and mutualdependence accounts. Purely procedural accounts take justice and authority to be altogether separate. Purely instrumental accounts make attributions of authority entirely dependent on institutions’ efficacy in realizing justice. Mutual-dependence accounts see justice and authority as <b>mutually</b> <b>defining</b> each other. On these accounts, an institution has authority {{if and only if}} it does what it reasonably can to omnilaterally interpret and secure the demands of justice.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new {{framework}} for runtime verification of properties of real time systems such as financial systems or backend databases. Such a systems has a semantics which resemples that of timed traces, namely a sequence of states where each state consists of predicates true in this state and then a timestamp explaining when the state is valid. We present a logic, LTLt, which {{is an extension of}} LTL with time constraints and a freeze quantifier and show how formulae in this logic are able to express properties of bounded liveness and safety which are ideal for these systems. It is shown how a formula in LTLt may be rewritten to a certain disjunctive normal form suitable for checking a real time system at runtime. The normal form captures the essential part of runtime verification by a set of <b>mutually</b> <b>defined</b> formula identifiers, each expressing two things: What should hold now and which formula identifiers that will need to hold in the next state. As part of the theoretical foundation for this work we propose a characterization of Runtime Verification and address the challenges in developing a method which is both sound and complete {{while at the same time}} efficient...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} historicity of female sexuality during the Song dynasty (960 - 1279), a time period when print technology, popular culture, and commercial activities {{had begun to}} boom yet prior {{to the emergence of}} a market for women's writings. It is both an intellectual history [...] to trace the changing and conflicting conceptualizations of female sexuality in both elite and popular discourses, and a social history [...] to look for the possible space and resources for women to negotiate autonomy over their sexual bodies and explore their desires. This dissertation proposes an approach [...] both academically and politically useful [...] to study the history of women, gender, and sexuality in premodern China in search of women's agency and possibilities of transgression using only extant sources written by elite men. That is, I treat my sources as multivocal and inspirational in order to emphasize the contradictory nature of intellectual discourses and social norms on the one hand, and popular appropriations of "traveling stories" and "circulating knowledge" on the other. I seek to examine the historical process of the formation of norms concerning female sexuality during this critical period in Chinese history, the nuances of "queerness" and transgressivenss in my source materials, and the ways that Song Dynasty culture and women's behaviors and practices related to their sexual bodies <b>mutually</b> <b>defined</b> each other...|$|E
40|$|Local {{sustainable}} food {{systems have}} captured the popular imagination as a progressive, if not radical, pillar of a sustainable food future. Yet these grassroots innovations are embedded in a dominant food regime that reflects productivist, industrial, and neoliberal policies and institutions. Understanding {{the relationship between these}} emerging grassroots efforts and the dominant food regime is of central importance in any transition to a more sustainable food system. In this study, we examine the encounters of direct farm marketers with food safety regulations and other government policies and the role of this interface in shaping the potential of local food in a wider transition to sustainable agri-food systems. This mixed methods research involved interview and survey data with farmers and ranchers in both the USA and Canada and an in-depth case study in the province of Manitoba. We identified four distinct types of interactions between government and farmers: containing, coopting, contesting, and collaborating. The inconsistent enforcement of food safety regulations is found to contain progressive efforts to change food systems. While government support programs for local food were helpful in some regards, they were often considered to be inadequate or inappropriate and thus served to coopt discourse and practice by primarily supporting initiatives that conform to more mainstream approaches. Farmers and other grassroots actors contested these food safety regulations and inadequate government support programs through both individual and collective action. Finally, farmers found ways to collaborate with governments to work towards <b>mutually</b> <b>defined</b> solutions. While containing and coopting reflect technologies of governmentality that reinforce the status quo, both collaborating and contesting reflect opportunities to affect or even transform the dominant regime by engaging in alternative economic activities as part of the 'politics of possibility'. Developing {{a better understanding of the}} nature of these interactions will help grassroots movements to create effective strategies for achieving more sustainable and just food systems...|$|E

40|$|Norms {{of justice}} are often invoked {{to justify the}} {{globalisation}} of forest policies but are rarely critically analysed. This paper reviews elements of justice in the values, knowledge, access and property rights relating to forests, especially in developing countries. Rather than defining justice in general terms of distribution of benefits and recognition of stakeholders, we argue that these processes are <b>mutually</b> <b>defining,</b> and can foreclose what is distributed, and to whom. Much recent forest policy, for example, emphasises forest carbon stocks and the benefits to indigenous peoples; but these terms de-emphasise livelihood outcomes for forests, and non-indigenous smallholders. Accordingly, we argue that current operationalisations of justice in forest policy based on John Rawls' principles of fair allocation to known actors {{need to be replaced}} by Amartya Sen's more deliberative and inclusive vision of justice that focuses instead on how different users experience different benefits, and seek to achieve multiple objectives together. © 2013 The Authors.
