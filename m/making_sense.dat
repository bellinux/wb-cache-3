40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the nature of <b>sense</b> <b>making</b> in 218 parents who have a child with Asperger syndrome (AS) by developing and validating a multi-item <b>sense</b> <b>making</b> scale for {{parents of children with}} AS (SMS-PCAS) and examined the relationships between <b>sense</b> <b>making</b> dimensions and both positive and negative adjustment outcomes. Two hundred and eighteen parents of children with AS completed questionnaires at Time 1 and 12 months later (Time 2). Exploratory factor analyses identified six <b>sense</b> <b>making</b> factors: spiritual perspective, causal attributions, changed perspective, identification, reframing, and luck/fate. All of the factors were psychometrically sound. Cross-sectional regression analyses indicated that the SMS-PCAS factors accounted for significant portions of variance in Time 1 depression, anxiety and positive affect. <b>Sense</b> <b>making</b> factors did not account for significant portions of variance in Time 2 adjustment variables after controlling for Time 1 adjustment and relevant demographics. Results provide support for the multi-dimensional nature of <b>sense</b> <b>making</b> and the differential relationships between <b>sense</b> <b>making</b> dimensions and adjustment outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Objective: In this study, {{the aim was}} {{to examine}} the {{dimensional}} structure of a multi-item measure of <b>sense</b> <b>making</b> in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and to investigate relations between <b>sense</b> <b>making</b> and both positive and negative adjustment outcomes. Method: Participants were 408 persons with MS and 232 caregivers. Questionnaires were completed at the initial assessment (Time 1) and 12 months later (Time 2). Results: Factor analysis of the <b>Sense</b> <b>Making</b> Scale (SMS) revealed 6 psychometrically sound factors: Redefined Life Purpose, Acceptance, Spiritual Perspective, Luck, Changed Values and Priorities, and Causal Attribution. Results of regression analyses indicated that the Time 2 SMS factors accounted for significant amounts of variance in each of the Time 2 adjustment outcomes (life satisfaction, positive states of mind, anxiety, depression, caregiver adjustment rating of the care receiver), after controlling for Time I adjustment and relevant demographic and illness variables. Conclusions: Findings delineate the dimensional structure of <b>sense</b> <b>making</b> in MS and the differential links between <b>sense</b> <b>making</b> dimensions and adjustment and have implications for the measurement of <b>sense</b> <b>making...</b>|$|R

25|$|In 1974, Tamiaki Yoneya {{discovered}} {{that all the}} known string theories included a massless spin-two particle that obeyed the correct Ward identities to be a graviton. John Schwarz and Joel Scherk came {{to the same conclusion}} and made the bold leap to suggest that string theory was a theory of gravity, not a theory of hadrons. They reintroduced Kaluza–Klein theory as a way of <b>making</b> <b>sense</b> of the extra dimensions. At the same time, quantum chromodynamics was recognized as the correct theory of hadrons, shifting the attention of physicists and apparently leaving the bootstrap program in the dustbin of history.|$|E
25|$|The {{party has}} {{published}} a number of newspapers throughout the years, {{with many of the}} theorists of the movement writing for these papers.

In 1973 the party launched a weekly paper The Irish People, which was focused on issues in the 26 counties, there was also a The Northern People published in Belfast and focused on northern issues. The party published an occasional international bulletin and a woman's magazine called Women's View. From 1989 to 1992 it produced a theoretical magazine called <b>Making</b> <b>Sense.</b> Other papers were produced such as Workers' Weekly.|$|E
25|$|In vertebrates, {{the nervous}} system can be split into two parts, {{the central nervous system}} (brain and spinal cord), and the {{peripheral}} nervous system. In many species — including all vertebrates — {{the nervous system}} is the most complex organ system in the body, with most of the complexity residing in the brain. The human brain alone contains around one hundred billion neurons and one hundred trillion synapses; it consists of thousands of distinguishable substructures, connected to each other in synaptic networks whose intricacies have only begun to be unraveled. The majority of the approximately 20,000–25,000 genes belonging to the human genome are expressed specifically in the brain. Due to the plasticity of the human brain, the structure of its synapses and their resulting functions change throughout life. Thus the challenge of <b>making</b> <b>sense</b> of all this complexity is formidable.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Sense</b> <b>making</b> is a meaning-making {{process that}} refers to the {{development}} of explanations for adversity. Despite a growing interest in this construct within the chronic illness literature, it has been neglected in research on carers. Purpose: This study examines the dimensional structure of a multi-item measure of <b>sense</b> <b>making</b> in carers of people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and investigates relations between <b>sense</b> <b>making</b> and both positive and negative adjustment outcomes. Method: Participants were 232 carers and their care recipients. Questionnaires were completed at first assessment (time 1) and 12 months later (time 2). Results: Factor analysis of the Carer <b>Sense</b> <b>Making</b> Scale (CSMS) revealed six psychometrically sound factors: catalyst for change, acceptance, spiritual perspective, incomprehensible. relationship ties, and causal attribution. Results of regression analyses indicated that the time 2 CSMS factors accounted for significant amounts of variance in each of the time 2 adjustment outcomes (life satisfaction, positive affect, anxiety, depression, care recipient adjustment ratings of carer) after controlling for time 1 adjustment and relevant demographic and illness variables. Conclusion: Findings delineate the dimensional structure of <b>sense</b> <b>making</b> in caregiving and the differential links between sense-making dimensions and adjustment, and have implications for the measurement of <b>sense</b> <b>making...</b>|$|R
25|$|PDZ domains {{are found}} in many {{different}} contexts and diverse proteins, but all assist in localization of cellular elements. PDZ domains are primarily involved in anchoring receptor proteins to the cytoskeleton. For cells to function properly {{it is important for}} the right components—proteins and other molecules— to be in the right place at the right time. Proteins with PDZ domains are able to bind to different components to ensure that the correct arrangement is met. In the neuron, <b>making</b> <b>sense</b> of neurotransmitter activity requires specific receptors to be located in the lipid membrane at the synapse. PDZ domains are crucial to this receptor localization process. Proteins with PDZ domains generally associate with both the C-terminus of the receptor and cytoskeletal elements in order to anchor the receptor to the cytoskeleton and keep it in place. Without such an interaction, receptors would diffuse out of the synapse due to the fluid nature of the lipid membrane.|$|E
25|$|Decollectivization {{increased}} the {{options available to}} individual households and made household heads increasingly responsible for the economic success of their households. In 1987, for example, it was legally possible to leave the village and move into a nearby town {{to work in a}} small factory, open a noodle stand, or set up a machine repair business. Farmers, however, still could not legally move into medium-sized or large cities. The Chinese press reported an increased appreciation in the countryside for education and an increased desire for agriculturally oriented newspapers and journals, as well as clearly written manuals on such profitable trades as rabbit-raising and beekeeping. As specialization and division of labor increased, along with increasingly visible differences in income and living standards, it became more difficult to encompass most of the rural population in a few large categories. During the early 1980s, the pace of economic and social change in rural China was rapid, and the people caught up in the change had difficulty <b>making</b> <b>sense</b> of the process.|$|E

His performance during the assault on Lumbier (October 1875) gained him Cruz Roja del Mérito Militar, with the second one obtained for directing artillery fire during the battle of Mañeru. Wounded in action a number of times. Following the battle of San Pedro Abanto he was nominated a captain, following the battle of Salvatierra/Agurain he rose to a , and he finished the war as a colonel. Following the Carlist defeat in 1876 he accompanied Carlos VII into exile and crossed the French border.|$|E
