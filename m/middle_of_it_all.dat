5|$|Born to Donnell and June (née Mercer) Cook, David is {{the oldest}} of six children. He has written more than 2,500 songs, {{including}} Drop that Rock, which was featured on his album In the <b>Middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>It</b> <b>All</b> and garnered a Dove Award nomination for Christian Country Album of the Year in 1999.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Mountainview Records {{released}} Cook's album, In the <b>Middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>All,</b> {{which earned}} him a Gospel Music Association Dove Award nomination for Christian Country Album of the Year in 1999. However, after a fallout with Mountainview records in 1999, he started his own record label, DLC Records. During this period Cook created a comedy character, named Mortermer Crabbottom, {{in the tradition of}} comedic Southern characters like Gomer Pyle.|$|E
5|$|In 1999 Cook started DLC Records {{after leaving}} Mountainview Records due to {{contractual}} and other disputes. While {{on the label}} Cook took his 1999 project, In The <b>Middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>All,</b> up the charts garnering several #1 singles, a Dove Award nomination and became the number one selling Christian country artists of all time. He incorporated Cook Enterprises to administer his contracts and personal business affairs, which included a children's television show development agreement with his management group, Five Star Music which produced a weekly show called, Crabbottom USA, taped at local television station, WHTV TV-39, a Nashville Tennessee based station.|$|E

Initially reluctant abbot van Necker agrees to marry them in the condition, however, that {{the bride and groom}} must find the two witnesses for the marriage. The Marquis Maffei for fear of reprisals refuses. Ceppi and Giulio agree to be the witnesses. Anna goes to Lucretia for help.

5000|$|After the {{recording}} Layla, {{we were on}} the road, and we scored an enormous amount of drugs to take with us. That {{was the beginning of the}} end ... Still, on our worst night we were the best band on the planet. It was impossible for us to play badly. - Bobby Whitlock discussing the demise of Derek and the Dominos, December 2006 Adding to the power of the Dominos' music, Clapton's inspiration for the songs on Layla was his unrequited love for Pattie Boyd, Harrison's wife. Whitlock began a relationship with Boyd's sister Paula at this time, and was therefore, as he has described it, [...] "in the inner circle ... in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> with <b>all</b> <b>of</b> them". He comments on a musical dialogue between Harrison and Clapton in their songs: [...] "There were subliminal messages, going back and forth, between two good friends as a way of healing and setting each other free ... I have always known that the better part of those songs All Things Must Pass were directed to Eric, just like Eric's were to George on the Layla record." ...|$|R

If you miss her at school on the Sunday morning, her mother has sent her to the shop, and perhaps told her to tell a falsehood about it; if her hand is clammy with lollipops, or there is a perfume of peppermint all round her, or down clatters a halfpenny in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> church, <b>it</b> is <b>all</b> her father's fault.' ...|$|R
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, the world is trapped in a time loop, and only one woman, named Pam (Carrie Hamilton), seems to know. Each day the events that happen differ slightly. A bank robbery is committed {{over and over again}} until finally the eventual bombing of the building is prevented. Somehow, Mulder and Scully are trapped in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Milligan and Harry Secombe {{became friends}} while {{serving in the}} Royal Artillery during the Second World War. Famously, Milligan first {{encountered}} Secombe after Gunner Milligan's artillery unit accidentally allowed a large howitzer to roll off a cliff, under which Secombe {{was sitting in a}} small wireless truck: [...] "Suddenly there was a terrible noise as some monstrous object fell from the sky quite close to us. There was considerable confusion, and in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> the flap of the truck was pushed open and a young, helmeted idiot asked 'Anybody see a gun?' It was Milligan." [...] Secombe's answer to that question was [...] "What colour was it?" [...] Milligan met Peter Sellers after the war at the Hackney Empire, where Secombe was performing, and the three became close friends.|$|E
2500|$|Huckstepp {{also went}} {{to the media and}} gave {{extensive}} interviews, claiming that Rogerson had murdered Lanfranchi and stolen $10,000 Lanfranchi was carrying to bribe Rogerson. She also claimed that Neddy Smith had lied to the inquest and was involved in a conspiracy with Rogerson. Rogerson maintained his innocence. In Neddy: The Life and Crimes of Arthur Stanley Smith, Smith wrote that Lanfranchi was [...] "attempting to bribe Rogerson. I was the person that took Warren to this fatal meeting. There was an inquest and both sides threw plenty of shit at one another. I was right in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> I could do nothing to bring Warren back to life, so I did the best thing I could. I know Warren’s family suffered deeply, but I cannot do anything about it." [...] He goes on to claim {{that as a result of}} his testimony at the inquest, Rogerson and other corrupt police officers gave him a [...] "green light" [...] to commit crime without fear of prosecution.|$|E
5000|$|The record {{features}} performances {{from several}} guest musicians, among them Kurt Vile, whom Sandoval and Ó Cíosóig invited {{to take part}} after hearing his music while shopping at a drum store in Dublin, and American singer-songwriter Mariee Sioux. It also features multi-instrumentalist Michael Masley performing gong and nyckelharpa on several tracks. He was asked to participate after Sandoval encountered him busking outside Berkeley's BART station. Sandoval said: [...] "We walked by and heard this beautiful music. ... He basically reinvents instruments. He has this gong, and he drills {{a hole in the}} <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and does <b>all</b> these crazy sounds. ... He has all this weird, crazy stuff that he does to create these amazing sounds, and he tells you, 'You're never gonna hear this sound again. Nobody is going to give you this sound!' You need to Google him now. He'll blow your mind." ...|$|R
5000|$|Marshall Von Erich is {{the stage}} name of Kevin Marshall Adkisson (born on November 10, 1992). He {{is the son}} of Kevin Von Erich. He was trained by Kevin, Harley Race and at the Noah dojo. He debuted in 2012, with his brother Ross in Pro Wrestling Noah. He adapted his father's {{trademark}} of wrestling barefoot. Marshall and Ross made their national television debut at Slammiversary XII on June 15, 2014, where they defeated The BroMans. On May 29,2015 the brothers debuted at Imperial Wrestling Revolution, their new home promotion. IWR was the largest, most [...] "thriving" [...] independent around, including Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas and Louisiana. Because of their family legacy running deep and the fast paced dreams of CEO/Owner Jerry [...] "The Boss" [...] Bostic these Von Erichs were well on their way to continue down and fulfill their family's wrestling legacy. In May 2017 their careers really changed for the better. Alongside IWR Marshall and Ross took on the Dallas-Ft. Worth Metroplex which was a first for the company. Although it was a substantial risk it landed them right in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> where <b>it</b> <b>all</b> began for the boys Father over 30 years prior, Dallas Fort Worth. During that tour,3rd generation Von Erichs were able to obtain their first big [...] "push". They won the IWR Tag Team Championships from the Arrow Club. From there they went on to defend the belts and even as a sign of appreciation the dynamic duo went and defended the gold in Israel, Summer of 2017. There was no disappointment when Ross and Marshall returned home with their father to Hawaii for rest and conditioning before their return home to the Imperial Wrestling Revolution.|$|R
5000|$|... "'Reasonable Ease...' is {{technically}} very variant with fast bits, slow bits, etc, {{but what we}} play within those parts is actually quite simple. On the other hand, a track like 'Better than Myself' is structurally very straightforward, but the parts we play that make up that structure are more technically difficult than a track that appears superficially to be pretty tricky. I guess it's {{safe to say that}} most of our songs are challenging in some way, even 'School' has a quirky time change throughout that means we can't fall asleep in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>it!</b> In short, <b>all</b> our songs are fun to play. No-one ever complains that a part is boring for them to play, or if they do they get told to shut up and use their imagination to liven it up. I think that's what makes us a little bit better than a straightforward punk band." [...] Cay drummer Mark Bullock on Cay’s technical approach to playing songs Cay drew on a variety of influences, predominantly “punky, grungy” material such as Nirvana, Sonic Youth and The Sex Pistols (which, in tandem with Mook’s hoarse and lacerating vocals, brought them comparisons to Hole which they ultimately found unwelcome). However, the band would also cite more diverse influences (such as Robert Fripp, or Mook’s childhood love of diva singers including Diana Ross, Barbra Streisand and Billie Holiday). The band's approach was often more technically exploratory than many of their peers, leading to further comparisons with bands such as Gang of Four and Nomeansno.|$|R

60|$|So then, if {{we would}} {{diminish}} the Mixture of the Rays, we are to diminish the Diameters of the Circles. Now these would be diminished if the Sun's Diameter to which they answer could be made less than it is, or (which comes to the same Purpose) if without Doors, at a great distance from the Prism towards the Sun, some opake Body were placed, with a round hole in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> to intercept <b>all</b> the Sun's Light, excepting so much as coming from the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> his Body could pass through that Hole to the Prism. For so the Circles AG, BH, and the rest, would not any longer answer to the whole Disque of the Sun, but only to that Part <b>of</b> <b>it</b> which could {{be seen from the}} Prism through that Hole, that it is to the apparent Magnitude of that Hole view'd from the Prism. But that these Circles may answer more distinctly to that Hole, a Lens is to be placed by the Prism to cast the Image of the Hole, (that is, every one of the Circles AG, BH, &c.) distinctly upon the Paper at PT, after such a manner, as by a Lens placed at a Window, the Species of Objects abroad are cast distinctly upon a Paper within the Room, and the rectilinear Sides of the oblong Solar Image in the fifth Experiment became distinct without any Penumbra. If this be done, it will not be necessary to place that Hole very far off, no not beyond the Window. And therefore instead of that Hole, I used the Hole in the Window-shut, as follows.|$|R

60|$|From {{the first}} this attempt was unfortunate, {{perhaps because the}} place for descent was ill-chosen. A balloon should come down in an empty open space, and he chose a crowd. He made his {{decision}} suddenly, and without proper reflection. As he trailed, Bert saw ahead of {{him one of the}} most attractive little towns in the world--a cluster of steep gables surmounted by a high church tower and diversified with trees, walled, and with a fine, large gateway opening out upon a tree-lined high road. All the wires and cables of the countryside converged upon it like guests to entertainment. It had a most home-like and comfortable quality, and it was made gayer by abundant flags. Along the road a quantity of peasant folk, in big pair-wheeled carts and afoot, were coming and going, besides an occasional mono-rail car; and at the car-junction, under the trees outside the town, was a busy little fair of booths. It seemed a warm, human, well-rooted, and altogether delightful place to Bert. He came low over the tree-tops, with his grapnel ready to throw and so anchor him--a curious, interested, and interesting guest, so his imagination figured it, in the very <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b>|$|E
