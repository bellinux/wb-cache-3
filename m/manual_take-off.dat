40|$|Hypotheses: H 1 : model-based {{constructability}} {{based on}} a parallel construction model should identify more constructability issues than traditional model-based constructability processes. H 2 : model-based quantity takeoff should take less time than <b>manual</b> <b>take-off.</b> H 3 : integrated location-based scheduling should enable schedule optimization over CPM–based approaches, resulting in shorter overall duration with more continuous resource use. Purpose: The goal {{of this paper is}} to present the case study of Kaiser Oakland hospital project, the largest known implementation of integrated 5 D systems combined with location-based planning. Research Design/Method: Parallel processes were implemented in the project. The results of integrated 5 D system were compared to the results of traditional constructability, estimating and scheduling processes. Findings: H 1 and H 3 were supported in the preconstruction of foundations. Over 200 additional constructability issues were identified using the construction model. Location-based scheduling enabled the planning of continuous work for subcontractors while compressing the duration of Foundation phase by six weeks. Contrary to the hypothesis H 2 there was no time saving benefits related to quantity take-off, although there were some qualitative benefits in terms of better communication. Limitations: Only Foundation phase was analyzed. Parallel processes are a form of waste. Implications: Integrated 5 D system was shown to provide better results for constructability and scheduling. Value for practitioners: Practitioners can learn from the challenges discussed in the paper. Use of an integrated 5 D system has not been described in technical literature before using a case study of this size. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} {{potential of}} voice recognition and synthesis circuits for general aviation, single-pilot IFR (SPIFR) situations is examined. The viewpoint {{of the pilot}} was central to workload analyses and assessment {{of the effectiveness of}} the voice systems. A twin-engine, high performance general aviation aircraft on a cross-country fixed route was employed as the study model. No actual control movements were considered and other possible functions were scored by three IFR-rated instructors. The SPIFR was concluded helpful in alleviating visual and <b>manual</b> workloads during <b>take-off,</b> approach and landing, particularly for data retrieval and entry tasks. Voice synthesis was an aid in alerting a pilot to in-flight problems. It is expected that usable systems will be available within 5 yr...|$|R
40|$|Digital {{models are}} used {{increasingly}} within the construction process from schematic design to production. However, architects and planners rarely use these building information models (BIM) when producing quantity take-off and cost estimates. Today, early estimates are {{in most cases}} based on cost per square meter (kr/m 2) from reference projects. Detailed cost estimates are provided only at the projects later phases when most choices and major decisions have been made. These are often based on manually calculated quantities using 2 D-drawings, which also decrease {{the accuracy of the}} cost estimate. Cost assessment is an important factor for a developer in determining the feasibility of an investment. During the schematic design phase {{it is important to be}} able to estimate the cost of different solutions to recognize which decisions have the most impact on the budget, before continuing into the next phase. Changes of decision made early in later phases are generally too expensive to realize. During the design development phase all of the major decisions for the project will be made. Building materials, installations, fixtures and finishes will be selected, making it possible to develop a more detailed cost estimate, based on the selected building parts, with a lower margin of error. However, these cost estimates are generally expensive and time-consuming to perform. This master thesis examines how an integrated 5 D BIM-application can be used to estimate a projects costs rather than traditional ways of <b>manual</b> quantity <b>take-off</b> and estimating. A method is also presented how the designer can create detailed estimates from BIM models. This thesis uses a case study in which a real project is designed and developed in 3 D CAD. The 3 D BIM-model was then imported to a 5 D BIM-application for further analysis and cost estimating. A 5 D BIM-application links a 3 D BIM-model with schedule (time) and costs. However, working with 5 D BIM requires disciplined working methods since mistakes are easy to make. Integrated design and estimating effects many actors in the supply chain. Also, one should consider if cost estimating using 5 D BIM is feasible in the project before implementing model based working methods supporting integrated design and cost estimation. 5 D BIM also effects the relationship between designers, planners and estimators. New skills as well as new relationships need to be developed. For an architect this may lead to new working methods and interaction with the client. The architect can also acquire a major role with more responsibility throughout the project. In interviews with developers, architects and engineers, the interest in integrated design and cost estimation is huge. ”I think that getting the cost estimating integrated in the planning phase is a huge benefit since the way we work today is rather ineffective” – Architect. The construction industry has been slow to embrace new methods and processes from the area of computer-aided design and information technology. It is important to remember that cost estimating with BIM does not mean a new profession. It means new tools that will affect existing working methods, where the implementation can be done gradually. However, the client needs to be aware and demand a BIM driven design process so that new and more effective design and cost estimation methods can be implemented.
