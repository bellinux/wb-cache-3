40|$|Objective: Compare the {{utilisation}} of losartan {{before and}} after the availability of generics in Belgium and its inclusion in the reference price system, which changed its reimbursement status. Determine the impact of reforms on expenditure/defined daily dose (DDD) for losartan and overall reimbursed expenditure for the angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs). Methods: Interrupted time-series analysis of monthly reimbursed prescriptions was used for all patients in Belgium covered by the social health insurance system prescribed an ARB alone or in combination between January 2007 and August 2011; that is, 42 months before generic losartan was included in the reference price system (July 2010) to 13 months after. Key findings: A significant increase in losartan utilisation was seen following its change in reimbursement status whereas all other ARBs still required prior approval for reimbursement. Losartan utilisation increased from 18 % of all single ARBs on a <b>moving</b> <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> (MAT) DDD basis just before the inclusion of losartan in the reference price system to 24 % on a MAT basis 12 months after this. During this period, total ARB utilisation increased by 1 %, consequently representing both new and switched patients. Reimbursed expenditure for losartan decreased 40 % 12 months after its inclusion in the reference price system despite a 22 % increase in utilisation. Total ARB expenditure reduced by 15 % during this period. Conclusion: The reforms, including altering the prescribing regulations for losartan, significantly enhanced its utilisation, reduced its expenditure/DDD and reduced overall ARB expenditure in Belgium. No further measures are suggested for Belgium with more ARBs losing or about to lose their patents. There has been no change in the utilisation patterns of losartan in countries following generic availability where there are no specific demand-side measures. These findings confirm that multiple measures are needed to change physician prescribing patterns...|$|E
40|$|In July 2003, a drink driving {{monitoring}} system became operational in the Dutch province of Zeeland. The {{monitoring system}} is organised in such way {{that not only}} the drink driving trend in Zeeland can be determined, but that {{it can also be}} compared with the national trend. Within the framework of the monitoring system, the Traffic Police Unit of Zeeland annually conducts 12 random breath testing sessions during Saturday nights, between 9 pm and 4 am. These sessions are evenly distributed over the four quarters of the year and the three police districts that Zeeland has. Halfway through each session, a one-hour break is scheduled. Basically, the drink driving trend in Zeeland can be determined every three months, based on <b>moving</b> <b>annual</b> <b>totals.</b> The roadside screening results, together with date and time of the tests, are automatically stored in the breath tester's data recorder. For apprehended offenders, some additional data that are relevant to drink driving enforcement policy are manually entered in the data file. It regards the variables sex, age, nationality, type of drinking place, and recidivism. During the first year, from July 2003 to June 2004, a sample of 5, 369 motorists were breath tested. The proportion of motorists exceeding the statutory BAC-limit of 0. 5 g/l was 2. 5 %. In the police district of Walcheren, this proportion was significantly higher than in the other two districts, Oosterscheldebekken and Zeeuws-Vlaanderen: 3. 2 % and 2. 2 %, respectively. Another remarkable result was that in the police districts of Walcheren and Zeeuws-Vlaanderen, one third of the apprehended offenders had the Belgian nationality. In the district of Oosterscheldebekken this was the case for none of the offenders. Recording of recidivism was insufficient to draw a conclusion on it. Comparison with the national drink driving roadside survey showed that drink driving in Zeeland in 2003 did not differ {{from the rest of the}} Netherlands...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to gain a better {{understanding}} of the land cover distributions, land cover changes and the differences in ecosystem service provisions resulting from distinctive indicators based on various CORINE land cover classes. By analyzing the land cover dynamics and the <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> Gross Primary Production (GPP) and Net Primary Production (NPP), Soil Organic Carbon (SOC), Carbon Storage (CS), and a qualitative indicator derived from the ecosystem service matrix method (GCR), this study measures the land cover distributions. The land-cover-based global climate regulation potential is assessed to improve global climate regulation. This study uses spatial and statistical analysis tools referring to Geographic Information Systems (GIS), the statistical package R and the software of SPSS are used to estimate the land cover and ecosystem services dynamics in Schleswig-Holstein. The study has found that “non-irrigated arable land” and “pastures” are the dominating land cover classes in Schleswig-Holstein, and the significant land cover changes are among them. “Non-irrigated arable land” and “pastures” have higher <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> stored GPP and NPP values than the other land cover classes. Geest has the largest <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> stored GPP and NPP even though the <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> GPP and NPP are less than the <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> GPP and NPP in Marsch. Simultaneously, Dithmarschen and Rendsburg-Eckernförde hold larger <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> stored GPP and NPP amounts than the other districts. The outcome of the comparison of qualitative and quantitative indicators of the global climate regulation service, the <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> GPP, the <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> NPP, SOC, Carbon Stocks and GCR is that all of them show significant correlations.

40|$|District {{heating systems}} have the {{potential}} to contribute to the UK renewable energy targets. However, {{there are a number of}} economic barriers which would have to be addressed in order to make district heating competitive in comparison with alternative heating technologies. The objective of this research was to model and analyse a district heating network and develop an optimisation method to calculate the minimum capital investment, heat losses and pump energy consumption. Firstly, modelling and analysis of a district heating network was conducted to obtain district heating design cases with minimum <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> energy consumption, <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> exergy consumption and annualised cost. Then through the analysis, a two-stage programming model was developed which synthesised design and optimal operation of a district heating network. The optimisation was used to minimise <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> energy consumption, <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> exergy consumption or annualised cost of the heat network by selecting suitable pump and pipe sizes, taking into account different parameters such as target pressure loss, temperature regime and operating strategy. The optimisation technique was used to investigate two different case studies, with high and low heat density. In all cases, a variable flow and variable supply temperature operating method was found to be beneficial. Design cases with minimum <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> energy consumption and annualised cost used rather small pipe diameters and large pressure drops. To achieve the minimum <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> exergy consumption a design case with larger pipe diameters and smaller pressure loss was found to be desirable. It was observed that by reducing the water temperature and increasing temperature difference between supply and return pipes, the <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> energy consumption, <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> exergy consumption and the annualised cost were reduced. It was also shown that district heating in an area with high heat density is more energy efficient and cost effective...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 20002 This study {{looked at}} early height growth of planted white spruce Picea glauca (Moench) Voss around the Fairbanks area. The effort focused on two Levels-of-Growing-Stock (LOGS) {{experimental}} plantations {{located in the}} Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest that incorporated an espacement study. <b>Annual</b> <b>total</b> height was also measured on 16 operational plantations and then compared to LOGS plantations. Average <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> height at Site 2 of the LOGS plantations was significantly greater than at Site 1. A significant difference in height growth between these sites was attributed to differences in aspect. Results showed significant <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> height differences among the espacement plots within the LOGS plantation. The narrowest spacing 1. 2 X 1. 2 m and widest spacing 3. 7 X 3. 7 showed a lower <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> height while spacings 1. 8 X 1. 8 m, 2. 4 X 2. 4 m, and 3. 0 X 3. 0 m showed a greater <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> height at age ten. The range of <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> height found at the LOGS sites was not significantly different than the range of <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> height found at the 16 operational plantations. Additionally, path {{analysis was used to}} quantify the direct and indirect effects of multiple environmental variables (i. e., percent slope, slope position, competition, aspect, and soil moisture) on growth rate at the operational plantations. It was found that slope position, percent slope, and competition had significant direct effects on growth rate. These results provide insight for resource managers when predicting the height growth of planted white spruce...|$|R

40|$|A new {{approach}} to minimise capital costs and energy usage in a district heating network is presented. The method comprises a two-stage programming model, which synthesises design and the optimal operation of a district heating network. Two different optimisation approaches—(a) minimising the <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> energy usage, and (b) minimising the equivalent annual cost of the heat network installation and operation—were examined and high and low temperatures district heating were investigated. For each optimisation approach, the minimum optimal <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> energy usage and minimum optimal equivalent annual cost were calculated and suitable pipe and pump sizes, taking into account different supply and return temperature regimes, target pressure losses and operating strategies within a district heating network were found. Design cases with minimum <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> energy usage and minimum equivalent annual cost used rather small pipe diameters and large pressure drops. This in turn reduced the <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> energy usage and the equivalent annual cost and the suitable pipe and pump sizes were selected. In addition, {{it was observed that}} by reducing the water temperature, the <b>annual</b> <b>total</b> energy usage and the equivalent annual cost could be reduced further. However, the obtained design cases based on a low temperature had relatively larger pipe sizes and smaller pressure drops compared with design cases obtained for the high temperature district heating...|$|R
