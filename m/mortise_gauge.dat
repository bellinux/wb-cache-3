5000|$|A <b>mortise</b> <b>gauge</b> is a {{woodworking}} tool {{used by a}} carpenter or joiner to scribe mortise and tenon joints on wood prior to cutting. Mortise gauges are commonly made of hardwood [...] with brass fittings.|$|E
50|$|Some mortise gauges are {{designed}} with one retractable spur, {{so that they can}} be used as marking gauges as well; however, because the <b>mortise</b> <b>gauge</b> is an expensive and high precision tool, many carpenters prefer to have a separate marking gauge for general use.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{the simpler}} marking gauge, a <b>mortise</b> <b>gauge</b> has a locking thumb screw slide for {{adjusting}} {{the distance of}} the scribe {{from the edge of the}} wood. It has two protruding pins, often called [...] "spurs", which are designed to scribe parallel lines marking both sides of a mortise at the same time. One of the pins is adjustable, attached to a sliding fence, so that mortises of different widths can be marked.|$|E
50|$|For complex joints, some <b>mortise</b> <b>gauges</b> have a double-beam design {{which allows}} the gauge to be wrapped around a tool such as a chisel for extra accuracy.|$|R
50|$|The {{style of}} gauge {{which uses a}} knife instead of a pin is often {{described}} as a cutting gauge.Other variations include a panel gauge which has a longer beam and larger headstock for scribing lines that are further from the reference edge. A <b>mortise</b> <b>gauge</b> has two pins that can be adjusted relative to each other {{at the end of the}} beam. This gauge is used to scribe two lines simultaneously and is most commonly used to lay out mortise and tenon joinery.|$|E
