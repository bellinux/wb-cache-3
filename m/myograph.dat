In addition, we characterized the melatonin receptor in this preparation, using analogues of melatonin, and examined the activity of various naphthalenic derivatives with biological activity in non-vascular models of melatonin receptors. Using the Halpern pressure <b>myograph,</b> cumulative addition of melatonin (0. 1 [*]nM to 1 [*]μM) produced direct vasoconstriction (19. 3 ± 6. 4 % reduction in lumen diameter, n= 5) in five of 11 pressurized segments, with pEC 50 of 9. 14 ± 0. 17. Similarly, non-cumulative application of melatonin caused vasoconstriction (19. 7 ± 4. 6 % reduction in lumen diameter, n= 7) in seven of 20 preparations examined with pEC 50 of 8. 74 ± 0. 26. The selective alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonist, UK- 14304 (5 -bromo- 6 -[2 -imidazolin- 2 -ylamino]-quinoxaline bitartrate), produced vasoconstriction in all ‘melatonin-insensitive' preparations. Melatonin (0. 1 [*]nM to 1 [*]μM) failed to elicit isometric contractions of tail artery segments in the Halpern wire <b>myograph,</b> but produced concentration-dependent potentiation of electrically-evoked, isometric contractions (maximum effect of 150 – 200 % enhancement) when applied either non-cumulatively (seven of seven preparations) or cumulatively (four of seven preparations). The pEC 50 value of melatonin (non-cumulative) was 8. 50 ± 0. 10 (n= 7) which was not different from that obtained in the pressure <b>myograph.</b> All further experiments were conducted using a non-cumulative protocol against electrically-evoked, isometric contractions. Based on the pEC 50 values for the melatonin analogues examined, the pharmacological profile for the enhancement of electrically-evoked contractions was 2 -iodomelatonin> 6 -chloromelatonin⩾(−) -AMMTC□thinsp; 5 [*]S 21634 ⩾melatonin⩾S 20098 >S 20242 ⩾S 20304 > 6 -[*]hydroxymelatonin>S 20932 >[*](+) [*]-AMMTC>N-acetyl- 5 -HT. Our data suggests the vascular receptor belongs to the MEL 1 -like subtype. All the indole-based analogues of melatonin, 2 -iodomelatonin, (−) -AMMTC, (+) -AMMTC, S 20932, 6 -chloromelatonin, 6 -hydroxymelatonin and N-acetyl- 5 -HT, behaved as full agonists. All the naphthalenic derivatives examined, S 21634, S 20098, S 20242 and S 20304 behaved as partial agonists relative to melatonin. The naphthalenic-based antagonists, S 20928 and S 20929, did not modify electrically-evoked, isometric contractions of the tail artery, but produced a parallel, rightward displacement of the melatonin concentration-response curve. Based upon the effect of 1 [*]μM S 20928 and S 20929, the estimated pKB values for these antagonists were 7. 18 ± 0. 25 (n= 4) and 7. 17 ± 0. 25 (n= 5), respectively.

After 10 weeks, <b>myographs</b> were used to test the reactivity of isolated thoracic aortic rings to norepinephrine and acetylcholine. Thereafter, the vascular rings were incubated with the NO-synthase blocker (nitro-L-arginine methyl ester) or the cyclooxygenase inhibitor (indomethacin) for 20 min, and the effects of norepinephrine and acetylcholine were re-evaluated. RESULTS: Norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction was enhanced after DHT treatment, but this effect was attenuated by calcitriol administration. Vasorelaxation of DHT-treated thoracic aortic rings was impaired, but this could be partly reversed by calcitriol application. Impaired NO-dependent vasorelaxation in DHT-treated animals was mostly reversed by concomitant calcitriol administration, but this effect was diminished by prostanoid-dependent vasoconstriction.

Results—Laminar veins were more sensitive to vasoconstrictor agonists than laminar arteries, and incubation of laminar veins with Ro- 31 - 8220 resulted in significantly smaller agonist-induced contractile responses for all agonists tested. In contrast, Ro- 31 - 8220 had no effect on agonist-induced contractile responses of laminar arteries.

As a result of digestion and phase II metabolism in the gut and liver, FA is converted predominantly into ferulic acid- 4 -O-sulfate (FA-sul), an abundant plasma metabolite. Although FA-sul may be the main metabolite, very little has been reported regarding its bioactivities. We have therefore compared the ex vivo vasorelaxing effect of FA and FA-sul (10 − 7 - 3. 10 − 5 M) on isolated mouse arteries mounted in tissue <b>myographs.</b> FA-sul, but not FA, elicited a concentration-dependent vasorelaxation of saphenous and femoral arteries and aortae.

We have investigated the role of intermediate conductance Ca 2 +-activated potassium (IKCa) channels in NO-mediated modulation of phenylephrine (PE) -evoked constriction in rat mesenteric resistance arteries. Methods: Third order mesenteric arteries were mounted in either a wire <b>myograph</b> or a pressure <b>myograph</b> as previously described. 1 Results: Pre-incubation with either L-NAME (NO synthase inhibitor; 100 μM; 30 mins) or TRAM- 34 (5 μM; 10 mins; IKCa inhibitor) significantly potentiated PE-evoked contractions in endotheliumintact segments of rat mesenteric artery (n= 5 - 6) mounted in a wire <b>myograph.</b> The effects of L-NAME and TRAM- 34 were not additive (n= 5 - 6) and these inhibitors did not alter PE-evoked responses in endothelium-denuded arteries (n= 5 - 6). Similarly, addition of L-NAME to the inside or the outside of endothelium-intact segments of mesenteric artery mounted in a pressure <b>myograph,</b> potentiated constrictions to PE (n= 4). In contrast, TRAM- 34 enhanced PE-evoked constriction when applied to the outside of the arteries but not when applied to the lumen (n= 3 - 4). Application of xestospongin (10 μM), a non-selective antagonist at inositol triphosphate receptors (IP 3 R), to the lumen of pressurized rat mesenteric arteries also potentiated constrictions to PE (n= 3). Subsequent addition of either L-NAME or TRAM- 34 did not further increase PE-evoked responses (n= 4). Ultrastructural immunohistochemistry demonstrated localization of IKCa at holes in the internal elastic lamina associated with myoendothelial gap junctions and accumulation of IP 3 R within endothelial cell projections in these arteries. Pre-incubation with either L-NAME or TRAM- 34 significantly inhibited relaxations to Ach (n= 10) in arterial segments mounted in a wire <b>myograph.</b> The magnitude of inhibition caused by Tram- 34 was not significantly different from that caused by L-NAME (n= 6 - 10) and the effects of the two inhibitors were not additive. Pre-incubation with apamin (50 nM), an inhibitor of SKCa, did not significantly alter Ach-evoked relaxation (n= 6). However, in the presence of either LNAME or Tram- 34, application of apamin reduced the maximum relaxation to Ach by around 80 % (n= 6 - 12; P less than 0. 01). Addition of L-NAME, apamin and TRAM- 34 together did not cause further significant inhibition of relaxation (n= 6 - 12 : P> 0. 05). TRAM- 34 and apamin did not alter relaxations evoked by the NO donor diethylamine NONOate (n= 4; P> 0. 05). Conclusion: These data indicate that endothelial IKCa modulate production and/or release of NO in rat mesenteric arteries. Activation of endothelial IKCa and IP 3 R by transfer of Ca 2 + and/or IP 3 from underlying smooth muscle cells may underlie NO-dependent modulation of vasoconstriction in these vessels...|$|E

Urocortin inhibited 9, 11 -dideoxy- 11 α, 9 α-epoxy-methanoprostaglandin F 2 α (U 46619) -induced contraction in a concentration-dependent manner and this inhibition was reversed by astressin, a corticotropin-releasing factor receptor antagonist. Micromolar concentrations of nickel (Ni 2 +) chloride, a putative inhibitor of the Na+-Ca 2 + exchanger, reduced the relaxant responses to urocortin. Urocortin-induced relaxation was abolished in a Na+-free solution, a condition that eliminates influence of the forward mode of Na +-Ca 2 + exchanger. In contrast, the relaxant responses to atrial natriuretic peptide or forskolin were unaffected by Ni 2 + or with removal of extracellular Na+. The present results provide indirect evidence suggesting that stimulation of Na+-Ca 2 + exchangers may contribute to urocortin-induced endothelium-independent pulmonary artery relaxation. © 2004 Elsevier B.

40|$|There is now {{overwhelming}} evidence for Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) as endothelial derived hyperpolarising factor (EDHF). Most recently, {{a number of}} pharmacological tools {{have been developed for}} the study of EETs in relation to EDHF responses. EETs have been shown to cause relaxation by activating smooth muscle large conductance Ca 2 + sensitive K+ (BKCa) (Archer et al, 2003). This dilatory response {{has been shown to be}} specifically inhibited by its analogue 14, 15 -epoxyeicosa- 5 (Z) enoic acid (14, 15 EEZE) in both human internal mammary artery and bovine coronary artery (Archer et al, 2003). Here we have investigated the antagonist effects of 14, 15 EEZE in murine arteries. Male Black 6 mice (12 - 18 weeks) were killed by lethal exposure to CO 2. First order arteries were isolated and mounted in wire <b>myographs</b> immersed in physiological salt solution (PSS). Arteries were equilibrated (30 mins) and tensions normalised as described previously (Mulvany and Halpern, 1977). Arteries incubated for 30 minutes with or without 3 ??g/ml 14, 15 EEZE. A concentration response curve to 11, 12 EET was performed cumulatively on arteries pre-contracted with EC 80 U 46619. In some experiments, arteries were pre-contracted with EC 80 U 46619, and concentration response to 14, 15 EEZE performed cumulatively...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{putative}} {{involvement of}} the vasculature seems to {{play a critical role}} in the pathophysiology of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We aimed to characterize alterations of mesenteric resistance arteries in GVHD in a fully MHC-mismatched model of BALB/c mice conditioned with total body irradiation that underwent transplantation with bone marrow cells and splenocytes from syngeneic (BALB/c) or allogeneic (C 57 BL/ 6) donors. After 4  weeks, animals were sacrificed and mesenteric resistance arteries were studied in a pressurized <b>myograph.</b> The expression of endothelial (eNOS) and inducible nitric oxide (NO) –synthase (iNOS) was quantified and vessel wall ultrastructure was investigated with electron microscopy. The <b>myograph</b> study revealed an endothelial dysfunction in allogeneic-transplant recipients, whereas endothelium-independent vasodilation was similar to syngeneic-transplant recipients or untreated controls. The expression of eNOS was decreased and iNOS increased, possibly contributing to endothelial dysfunction. Additionally, arteries of allogeneic transplant recipients exhibited a geometry-independent increase in vessels strain. For both findings, electron microscopy provided a structural correlate by showing severe damage of the whole vessel wall in allogeneic-transplant recipient animals. Our study provides further data to prove, and is the first to characterize, functional and structural vascular alterations in the early course after allogeneic transplantation directly in an ex vivo setting and, therefore, strongly supports the hypothesis of a vascular form of GVHD...|$|E
40|$|Cardiovascular disease {{remains the}} leading cause of death in Germany. There has been intense {{research}} for many years into the causes of atherosclerotic vascular changes to identify new therapeutic strategies. Endothelial dysfunction has played a central role in prior investigations due to its importance in the loss of vasoprotective mechanisms. The decreased bioavailability of NO (nitric oxide) plays a key role in this process. The synthesis of NO occurs with the help of NO-synthase, which is regulated, among others, by HDL (high-density lipoprotein). With the help of the small vessel <b>myograph,</b> experiments were performed on the thoracic aortas of rats and different mice species. The effect of different vasoactive substances on vessel tone was analyzed during the experiments. Special focus was given to the effects of lysophospholipid lysosulfatide (LSF) which is a bioactive component of HDL. The experiments with the small vessel <b>myograph</b> showed that LSF has a vasodilative effect on vasoconstricted vessels. Furthermore, it could be demonstrated that LSF activates the endothelial NO-synthase when binding to the S 1 P 3 receptor. LSF is able to elicit vascularprotective effects via the increase of NO-bioavailability. In the search for new strategies for the treatment of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerotic vascular changes, LSF illustrates an interesting new therapeutic approach...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if increased expression of heme oxygenase (HO) contributes to impairment of aortic contractile responses after hypoxia through effects on reactivity to endothelin- 1 (ET- 1). Thoracic aortas from normoxic rats and from rats exposed to hypoxia (10 % O 2) for 16 or 48 hours were mounted in organ bath <b>myographs</b> for contractile studies, fixed in paraformaldeyde or frozen in liquid nitrogen for later protein extraction. In rings from normoxic rats, the HO inhibitor tin protoporphyrin IX (SnPP IX, 10 µmol/L) did not alter the response to phenylephrine or ET- 1. In rings from rats exposed to hypoxia for 16 hours, maximum tension generated in response to these agonists was higher in endothelium-intact but not –denuded rings in the presence of SnPP IX. In rings from rats exposed to hypoxia for 48 hours SnPP IX increased contraction in endothelium-intact but not-denuded rings. In endothelium-intact aortic rings from rats exposed to hypoxia for 16 hours incubated with the endothelin A receptor-specific antagonist BQ 123 (10 - 7 M), SnPP IX did not alter phenylephrineinduced contraction. Aortic endothelin- 1 protein levels, measured by radioimmunoassay, were increased in rats exposed to hypoxia for 16 and 48 hours. Western blotting showed that HO-...|$|R
40|$|Obesity is {{associated}} with insulin resistance in the peripheral vasculature and is an important risk factor for coronary artery disease. The current study assessed whether the vascular effects and the signaling pathways of insulin are impaired in coronary arteries from a rat model of genetic obesity. Intramyocardial arteries from obese Zucker rats (OZR) and lean Zucker rats (LZR) were mounted in microvascular <b>myographs</b> to assess insulin vasoactive effects and the proteins of the insulin pathway were determined by Western blotting. The endothelium-dependent and nitric oxide (NO) -mediated vasorelaxant effect of insulin was similar in arteries from LZR and OZR and blunted by inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), but unaltered by either mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) or endothelin (ET) receptor blockade. Basal levels of phospho-eNOS Ser 1177 and phospho-Akt Ser 473 were up-regulated in OZR, and insulin increased phosphorylation of eNOS and Akt in both LZR and OZR. Moreover, insulin enhanced Akt expression in LZR. Basal and insulin-stimulated levels of phospho-MAPK p 42 /p 44 were lower in OZR and palmitic acid reduced these levels in LZR. Coronary arteries are protected from vascular IR. The results underscore the fact that preservation of insulin-mediated vasorelaxation along with an up-regulation of the Akt/eNOS pathway and an impairment of the MAPK cascade account for this protection...|$|R
40|$|Preconditioning {{the heart}} with brief periods of {{ischaemia}} induces delayed endothelial protection against reperfusion injury, but the precise mechanisms {{involved in this}} endogenous protein are still unclear. Induction of the type II-nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) acts as a mediator of the preconditioning against myocardial infarction and stunning. The present {{study was designed to}} assess whether iNOS also contributes to the delayed endothelial protective effects of preconditioning. Rats were subjected to 20 [*]min ischaemia followed by 60 [*]min reperfusion 24 [*]h after sham surgery or preconditioning (one cycle or 2 [*]min ischaemia/ 5 [*]min reperfusion and two cycles of 5 [*]min ischaemia/ 5 [*]min reperfusion). At the end of the reperfusion, coronary segments were removed distal to the site of occlusion and mounted in wire <b>myographs.</b> Ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R) decreased the endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine (maximal relaxations: sham, 66 ± 5 %; I/R, 40 ± 1 %; P< 0. 05) and this impairment was prevented by preconditioning (maximal relaxation: 61 ± 6 %). Administration of N-(3 -aminomethyl) benzyl) acetaminide (1400 W), a highly selective inhibitor for iNOS, 10 [*]min before prolonged ischaemia did not modify the beneficial effect of preconditioning (maximal relaxation: 66 ± 5 %). These data show that preconditioning induces delayed protection against reperfusion-injury. However, in contrast to the myocytes, these endothelial protective effects of delayed preconditioning do not involve iNOS...|$|R
