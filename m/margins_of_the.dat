5|$|Thick haze {{and smoke}} {{originating}} from burning biomass in northwestern India {{and air pollution}} from large industrial cities in northern India often concentrate over the Ganges Basin. Prevailing westerlies carry aerosols along the southern <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sheer-faced Tibetan Plateau towards eastern India and the Bay of Bengal. Dust and black carbon, which are blown towards higher altitudes by winds at the southern <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Himalayas, can absorb shortwave radiation and heat the air over the Tibetan Plateau. The net atmospheric heating due to aerosol absorption causes the air to warm and convect upwards, increasing the concentration of moisture in the mid-troposphere and providing positive feedback that stimulates further heating of aerosols.|$|E
5|$|Hypertrophic scars are uncommon, and are {{characterized}} by increased collagen content after the abnormal healing response. They are described as firm and raised from the skin. Hypertrophic scars remain within the original <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wound, whereas keloid scars can form scar tissue outside of these borders. Keloid scars from acne occur more often in men and people with darker skin, and usually occur on {{the trunk of the}} body.|$|E

5|$|The thorax {{is divided}} into two groups of somites. The {{anterior}} group is composed of four somites, each with well-developed walking limbs with lengths that extend past the <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carapace. Their morphological details are not well preserved but their distal segments appear to possess a multitude of small spines. It is unknown if these limbs are biramous, but they are assumed to be the endopodites, the inner branches (ramus) of the leg, with the exopodites, or outer branches, absent or not preserved.|$|E
5|$|This {{episode is}} the forty-ninth from the fifth season of Adventure Time. Visually, the episode is framed having the {{important}} {{events of the}} story occur in its center, bordered circularly. Small polygonal creatures appear in the <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outer frame. Film and television critic Eric Kohn, in IndieWire, dubbed the inner frame a time bubble, absorbing the creatures Bubblegum experiments on with the time travel device. Following Lumpy having her memory erased in the episode, Johnnie appears in the outer frame.|$|E
5|$|Indraloris {{is known}} only from {{isolated}} teeth and {{fragments of the}} mandible. These show that Indraloris was a medium-sized sivaladapid, somewhat smaller than Sivaladapis. In 1982, Gingerich and colleagues estimated that Indraloris himalayensis may have weighed 3.7 to 4.3kg (8.2 to 9.5lb) {{on the basis of}} allometric scaling of tooth size; Flynn and Morgan estimated a body size of about 2kg (4.4lb) for I.kamlialensis. In general, the cingula (shelves) on the <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cheekteeth are weak in Indraloris. Among the two named species, I.kamlialensis is about 20% smaller than I.himalayensis. The unnamed large Indraloris is similar in size to I.himalayensis.|$|E

5000|$|The clypeus is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sclerites {{that make}} up the [...] "face" [...] of an arthropod. In insects, the clypeus delimits <b>the</b> lower <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> face, with the labrum {{articulated}} along <b>the</b> ventral <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clypeus. The mandibles bracket the labrum, but do not touch the clypeus. <b>The</b> dorsal <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clypeus is below the antennal sockets. The clypeus is often well-defined by sulci ("grooves") along its lateral and dorsal margins, and is most commonly rectangular or trapezoidal in overall shape.|$|R

5|$|Some {{birds have}} also {{demonstrated}} {{the capacity to}} fall into slow-wave sleep one hemisphere of the brain at a time. The birds tend to exercise this ability depending upon its position relative {{to the outside of}} the flock. This may allow the eye opposite the sleeping hemisphere to remain vigilant for predators by viewing the outer <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flock. This adaptation is also known from marine mammals. Communal roosting is common because it lowers the loss of body heat and decreases the risks associated with predators. Roosting sites are often chosen with regard to thermoregulation and safety.|$|E
5|$|The P. rebeli {{are noted}} for their large blue wings, with the males {{displaying}} a violet blue shade and the females displaying blue basal areas interspersed with brown spots, {{similar to other}} butterflies in its genus. The undersides of the butterfly are a dark brown with small black spots that are circled in white. It can be distinguished from its close relative, the P. alcon, by the broader black <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upperside male and the extensive blue basal areas in the females. It has a wingspan of approximately 32–36mm.|$|E
5|$|The {{demographic}} {{growth that}} occurred in Sélestat after 1945 was primarily due to a relatively high birth rate (20.1‰ in Sélestat over the period 1968–1975, compared to 16.9‰ in France). After 1975, this rate progressively declined to match the national figure. Net migration figures remained slightly negative until 1990 because Sélestat and Central Alsace were on the <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metropolitan areas of Strasbourg and Colmar and lacked attractivity. Since 1990, the Strasbourg area greatly expanded to gradually reach Sélestat. The town has thus become more attractive to newcomers.|$|E

5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (openings in {{the palate}} between the incisors and the molars) are broad and long, extending {{to the front}} <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first upper molar (M1). Wilfredomys has even longer incisive foramina, extending between the molars, but the foramina are shorter in J.ossitenuis and J.pictipes. The palate itself is wide and short, with its back margin between the M3s. Oryzomyines like Oecomys and Oligoryzomys have longer palates, extending beyond the third molars. Fine openings (foramina) are present on the palate. The back margin of the palate is squared; J.anoblepas lacks a spine {{in the middle of}} the back margin, as is present in Rhipidomys. Wilfredomys has the back margin U-shaped instead and has a longer palate, with the back margin behind the M3s.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the mangrove whipray is very thick and oval in shape, measuring 0.9–1.0 times {{as wide as}} long. The anterior <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disc are nearly straight and converge at a broad angle on the snout tip. The medium-sized, widely spaced eyes are immediately followed by the spiracles. Between the long, thin nostrils is a short, broad curtain of skin with a finely fringed posterior margin. The lower jaw is bow-shaped, and there are 0–5 papillae across {{the floor of the}} mouth. The teeth are arranged in a quincunx pattern and number 40–50 rows in the upper jaw and 38–50 rows in the lower jaw. There are five pairs of gill slits beneath the disc. The pelvic fins are small and narrow.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc {{of the plain}} maskray is thin and diamond-shaped with narrowly rounded outer corners, measuring 1.1–1.3 times longer than wide. The leading <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disc are gently concave and converge at a broad angle to the pointed tip of the snout. The small eyes are placed close together, and behind them are the spiracles. The nostrils are elongated and have a skirt-shaped flap of skin between them. The small mouth bears prominent furrows at the corners and contains two slender papillae on the floor. Small papillae are also found around {{the outside of the}} mouth. There are five pairs of gill slits. The pelvic fins are fairly large and pointed.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>The</b> {{objective}} <b>of</b> {{this work}} was to perform a morphometric evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mandibular foramen <b>of</b> cats with no defined breed {{in order to establish}} its more precise topography and to offer subsides for a more effective local anesthetic blockage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mandibular alveolar nerve. Thirty adult cats (Felis catus) (5 male and 25 female) with no defined breed were used. After collection and preparation <b>of</b> mandibles with <b>the</b> aid <b>of</b> a universal caliper rule, the 6 reference points were measured: LONG (from <b>the</b> most lateral <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> condylar process up to the first inferior incisor tooth); TRANS (from the ventral margin up to the dorsal mandible margin between the second premolar tooth and the first inferior molar tooth); FVENTRAL (from <b>the</b> most rostral <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mandibular foramen up to the ventral mandibular margin); ANG (from <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most rostral <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mandibular foramen up to the mandible angular process), COND (from <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most rostral <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mandibular foramen up to <b>the</b> medial <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mandible condylar process) and COR (from <b>the</b> most rostral <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mandibular foramen up to <b>the</b> medial <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mandible condylar process). Following, the data obtained were submitted to descriptive statistical analysis and to the student’s t-test with p = 0. 05. It was observed that for a better local anesthetic blockage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inferior alveolar nerve, the needle should be introduced 4. 1 to 4. 4 mm from the mandible ventral margin and 12. 37 to 12. 57 mm from the angular process...|$|R

5|$|The {{skull of}} Dinocephalosaurus {{is low and}} narrow, with a long premaxilla and maxilla {{compared}} to those of Tanystropheus. Both the premaxilla and the maxilla meet at the anteroventral (front bottom) corner {{and contribute to the}} border of the nostril, which is located at the anterior (front) end of a long recess that extends along the snout in front of the eye socket (the antorbital depression). The bottom <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two snout bones are respectively lined with five and twelve long and nail-like teeth; the third premaxillary and fourth and fifth maxillary teeth are distinctly fang-like. The lower jaw has fifteen preserved teeth, with three of them being fang-like. By comparison, the teeth in adult Tanystropheus are sharp pegs, while they are tricuspid (bearing three cusps) in juveniles.|$|E
5|$|The {{spinner shark}} is a fast, active swimmer that {{sometimes}} forms large schools, segregated {{by age and}} sex. Young individuals prefer cooler water temperatures than adults. Off South Africa, females are found close to shore year-round while males only appear during the summer. Smaller spinner sharks may be preyed upon by larger sharks. Known parasites of the spinner shark include the copepods Kroyeria deetsi, Nemesis pilosus, and N. atlantica, which infest the shark's gills, Alebion carchariae, which infests the skin, Nesippus orientalis, which infests the mouth and gill arches, and Perissopus dentatus, which infests the nares and the rear <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fins.|$|E
5|$|The {{terminus}} for {{the high-speed}} line in London is St Pancras railway station. During the 2000s, {{towards the end}} of the construction of the CTRL, the entire station complex was renovated, expanded and rebranded as StPancras International, with a new security-sealed terminal area for Eurostar trains to continental Europe. In addition, it retained traditional domestic connections to the north and south of England. The new extension doubled the length of the central platforms now used for Eurostar services; new platforms have been provided for existing domestic East Midlands Trains and the Southeastern high-speed services that run along High Speed 1 to Kent. New platforms on the Thameslink line across London were built beneath the western <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station, and the station at King's Cross Thameslink was closed.|$|E
50|$|L. chenghaiensis is {{distinguished}} {{from all other}} species of Liobagrus with a serrated posterior <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pectoral-fin spine by possessing a free apex on <b>the</b> posterior <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adipose fin. It is similar to L. marginatus in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> a subtruncate caudal fin, by which both are distinguished from all other Chinese congeners with a serrated posterior <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pectoral-fin spine. These two species are distinguished by differences in the body depth and {{the distance between the}} pelvic-fin insertion and the vent. Their distinction is also supported by osteological evidence.|$|R

40|$|Neurons {{responding}} to innocuous thermal stimulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anterior tongue were newly identified in <b>the</b> dorsal <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trigeminal principal nucleus (PV). Connections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dorsal <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PV were neuroanatomically identified using wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) with electrophysiological techniques. Injection <b>of</b> WGA-HRP into <b>the</b> dorsal <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PV demonstrated anterograde labels distributed {{from the most}} dorsomedial portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> posteromedial ventral nucleus (VPM) to <b>the</b> dorsolateral portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parvicellular part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VPM, and retrograde labels in <b>the</b> superficial layers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> caudal subnucleus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spinal trigeminal nucleus (SpVc).

5|$|Utah {{and western}} Colorado were {{deformed}} as {{the rate of}} subduction off the west coast increased in the Middle Jurassic Sevier Orogeny. At the same time, an inland sea began to encroach on the continent from the north. Broad tidal flats and streams carrying iron oxide-rich mud formed on the <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shallow sea to the west, creating the Sinawava member of the Temple Cap Formation. Flat-bedded sandstones, siltstones, and limestones filled depressions left in the underlying eroded strata. Streams eroded the poorly cemented Navajo Sandstone, and water caused the sand to slump.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{development}} continued, {{including the}} growth of Old Town up the hillside (Green Street Farm Estate) and the housing estates of Hampden Park, Willingdon Trees and Langney. During {{the latter half of}} the 20th century, there were controversies over the demolition of Pococks, a 15th-century manor house on what is now the Rodmill Housing Estate, and the granting of planning permission for a 19-storey block at the western end of the seafront. The latter project (South Cliff Tower) was realised in 1965 despite a storm of protest led by the newly formed Eastbourne and District Preservation Committee, which later became Eastbourne Civic Society, and was renamed the Eastbourne Society in 1999. Local conservationists also failed to prevent the construction of the glass-plated TGWU conference and holiday centre, but were successful in purchasing Polegate Windmill, thus saving it from demolition and redevelopment. Most of the expansion took place on the northern and eastern <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town, gradually swallowing surrounding villages. However, the richer western part was constrained by the Downs and has remained largely unchanged. In 1981, a large section of the town centre was replaced by the indoor shops of the Arndale Centre.|$|E

The leading <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disc are very gently convex, and converge on a blunt, broadly triangular snout. The eyes {{are small and}} immediately followed by much larger spiracles. The widely spaced nostrils are long and narrow; between them is a short, skirt-shaped curtain of skin with a fringed posterior margin. The modestly sized mouth has an evenly arched lower jaw, prominent grooves at the corners, and 5–7 papillae (nipple-like structures) on the floor. Additional, tiny papillae are scattered on the nasal curtain and outside the lower jaw. The teeth are arranged with a quincunx pattern into flattened surfaces; each tooth is small and blunt, with a roughly diamond-shaped base. There are 45–55 tooth rows in either jaw. The pelvic fins are somewhat large and rounded at the tips.|$|E
