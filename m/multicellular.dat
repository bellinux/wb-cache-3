5|$|Bacteria often {{function}} as <b>multicellular</b> aggregates known as biofilms, exchanging {{a variety of}} molecular signals for inter-cell communication, and engaging in coordinated <b>multicellular</b> behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Once {{growth and}} {{development}} are completed, vitamins remain essential nutrients for the healthy maintenance of the cells, tissues, and organs {{that make up a}} <b>multicellular</b> organism; they also enable a <b>multicellular</b> life form to efficiently use chemical energy provided by food it eats, and to help process the proteins, carbohydrates, and fats required for cellular respiration.|$|E
5|$|As the Ediacaran biota {{represent}} {{an early stage}} in <b>multicellular</b> life's history, it is unsurprising that not all possible modes of life are occupied.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria like archaea are prokaryotic – unicelluar, {{and having}} no cell nucleus or other membrane-bound organelle. Bacteria are microscopic, {{with a few}} {{extremely}} rare exceptions, such as Thiomargarita namibiensis. Bacteria function and reproduce as individual cells, but they can often aggregate in <b>multicellular</b> colonies. Some species such as myxobacteria can aggregate into complex swarming structures, operating as <b>multicellular</b> groups {{as part of their}} life cycle, or form clusters in bacterial colonies such as E.coli.|$|E
5|$|Invertebrates {{constitute}} {{a vast array}} of living organisms ranging from the simplest unicellular eukaryotes such as Paramecium to such complex <b>multicellular</b> animals as the octopus, lobster and dragonfly. They {{constitute a}}bout 95% of the animal species. By definition, none of these creatures has a backbone. The cells of single-cell protozoans have the same basic structure as those of <b>multicellular</b> animals but some parts are specialized into the equivalent of tissues and organs. Locomotion is often provided by cilia or flagella or may proceed via the advance of pseudopodia, food may be gathered by phagocytosis, energy needs may be supplied by photosynthesis and the cell may be supported by an endoskeleton or an exoskeleton. Some protozoans can form <b>multicellular</b> colonies.|$|E
5|$|Of {{eukaryotic}} groups, the protists {{are most}} commonly unicellular and microscopic. This {{is a highly}} diverse group of organisms that {{are not easy to}} classify. Several algae species are <b>multicellular</b> protists, and slime molds have unique life cycles that involve switching between unicellular, colonial, and <b>multicellular</b> forms. The number of species of protists is unknown since only a small proportion has been identified. Protist diversity is high in oceans, deep sea-vents, river sediment and an acidic river, suggesting that many eukaryotic microbial communities may yet be discovered.|$|E
5|$|Periods {{of intense}} cold {{have also been}} {{suggested}} {{as a barrier to}} the evolution of <b>multicellular</b> life.|$|E
5|$|The kingdom Animalia or metazoa, {{contains}} <b>multicellular</b> {{organisms that}} are heterotrophic and motile (although some have secondarily adopted a sessile lifestyle). Most animals have bodies differentiated into separate tissues and {{these animals are}} also known as eumetazoans. They have an internal digestive chamber, {{with one or two}} openings; the gametes are produced in <b>multicellular</b> sex organs, and the zygotes include a blastula stage in their embryonic development. Metazoans do not include the sponges, which have undifferentiated cells.|$|E
5|$|All {{organisms are}} {{constantly}} exposed to compounds that they cannot use as foods {{and would be}} harmful if they accumulated in cells, as they have no metabolic function. These potentially damaging compounds are called xenobiotics. Xenobiotics such as synthetic drugs, natural poisons and antibiotics are detoxified {{by a set of}} xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes. In humans, these include cytochrome P450 oxidases, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, and glutathione S-transferases. This system of enzymes acts in three stages to firstly oxidize the xenobiotic (phase I) and then conjugate water-soluble groups onto the molecule (phase II). The modified water-soluble xenobiotic can then be pumped out of cells and in <b>multicellular</b> organisms may be further metabolized before being excreted (phase III). In ecology, these reactions are particularly important in microbial biodegradation of pollutants and the bioremediation of contaminated land and oil spills. Many of these microbial reactions are shared with <b>multicellular</b> organisms, but due to the incredible diversity of types of microbes these organisms are able to deal with a far wider range of xenobiotics than <b>multicellular</b> organisms, and can degrade even persistent organic pollutants such as organochloride compounds.|$|E
5|$|For <b>multicellular</b> organisms, {{typically}} the embryo is engineered which grows into the adult genetically modified organism. However, the genomes of cells {{in an adult}} organism can be edited using gene therapy techniques to treat genetic diseases.|$|E
5|$|Homeostasis is {{the ability}} of an open system to {{regulate}} its internal environment to maintain stable conditions by means of multiple dynamic equilibrium adjustments that are controlled by interrelated regulation mechanisms. All living organisms, whether unicellular or <b>multicellular,</b> exhibit homeostasis.|$|E
5|$|Microfossils {{dating from}} – just 3million {{years after the}} end of the Cryogenian glaciations– may {{represent}} embryonic 'resting stages' in the life cycle of the earliest known animals. An alternative proposal is that these structures represent adult stages of the <b>multicellular</b> organisms of this period.|$|E
5|$|The {{absence of}} wheels in nature is {{frequently}} attributed to constraints imposed by biology: natural selection constrains the evolutionary paths available to species, and the {{processes by which}} <b>multicellular</b> organisms grow and develop may not permit {{the construction of a}} functioning wheel.|$|E
5|$|The {{processes}} of evolution, {{as they are}} presently understood, can help explain why wheeled locomotion has not evolved in <b>multicellular</b> organisms: simply put, a complex structure or system will not evolve if its incomplete form provides no benefit to the organism.|$|E
5|$|A {{very large}} and {{internally}} consistent alignment of 1,719 proteins at the metazoan scale, published in 2017, showed that (i) sponges – represented by Homoscleromorpha, Calcarea, Hexactinellida, and Demospongiae – are monophyletic, (ii) sponges are sister-group to all other <b>multicellular</b> animals, (iii) ctenophores emerge as the second-earliest branching animal lineage, and (iv) placozoans emerge as the third animal lineage, followed by cnidarians sister-group to bilaterians.|$|E
5|$|Animals as a {{category}} have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things. Animals are eukaryotic and usually <b>multicellular</b> (although see Myxozoa), which separates them from bacteria, archaea, and most protists. They are heterotrophic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from plants and algae. They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and fungi by lacking cell walls.|$|E
5|$|Geochemical {{observations}} {{may help}} to deduce the global level of biological activity, or the affinity of certain fossils. For example, geochemical features of rocks may reveal when life first arose on Earth, and may provide evidence {{of the presence of}} eukaryotic cells, the type from which all <b>multicellular</b> organisms are built. Analyses of carbon isotope ratios {{may help to}} explain major transitions such as the Permian–Triassic extinction event.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{focusing}} on individual organisms, paleoecology examines the interactions between different organisms, such as their places in food chains, and the two-way interaction between organisms and their environment.  One example {{is the development of}} oxygenic photosynthesis by bacteria, which hugely increased the productivity and diversity of ecosystems. This also caused the oxygenation of the atmosphere. Together, these were a prerequisite for the evolution of the most complex eukaryotic cells, from which all <b>multicellular</b> organisms are built.|$|E
5|$|New {{morphological}} {{features and}} ultimately new species {{are produced by}} variations in the toolkit, either when genes are expressed in a new pattern, or when toolkit genes acquire additional functions. Another possibility is the Neo-Lamarckian theory that epigenetic changes are later consolidated at gene level, something {{that may have been}} important early in the history of <b>multicellular</b> life.|$|E
5|$|Other {{proteins}} that serve structural functions are motor proteins such as myosin, kinesin, and dynein, which {{are capable of}} generating mechanical forces. These proteins are crucial for cellular motility of single celled organisms and the sperm of many <b>multicellular</b> organisms which reproduce sexually. They also generate the forces exerted by contracting muscles and play essential roles in intracellular transport.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{emergence}} of these first <b>multicellular</b> organisms, a remarkable amount of biological diversity appeared over approximately 10 million years, in an event called the Cambrian explosion. Here, the majority of types of modern animals appeared in the fossil record, as well as unique lineages that subsequently became extinct. Various triggers for the Cambrian explosion have been proposed, including the accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere from photosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known embryos, from China's Doushantuo Formation, appear just {{a million}} years after the Earth emerged from a global glaciation, suggesting that ice cover and cold oceans may have prevented the emergence of <b>multicellular</b> life. Potentially, complex life may have evolved before these glaciations, and been wiped out. However, the diversity of life in modern Antarctica has sparked disagreement over whether cold temperatures increase or decrease the rate of evolution.|$|E
5|$|The next larger scale, cell biology, {{studies the}} {{structural}} and physiological properties of cells, including their internal behavior, interactions with other cells, {{and with their}} environment. This is done on both the microscopic and molecular levels, for unicellular organisms such as bacteria, {{as well as the}} specialized cells of <b>multicellular</b> organisms such as humans. Understanding the structure and function of cells is fundamental to all of the biological sciences. The similarities and differences between cell types are particularly relevant to molecular biology.|$|E
5|$|A {{striking}} {{feature of}} metabolism is {{the similarity of}} the basic metabolic pathways and components between even vastly different species. For example, the set of carboxylic acids that are {{best known as the}} intermediates in the citric acid cycle are present in all known organisms, being found in species as diverse as the unicellular bacterium Escherichia coli and huge <b>multicellular</b> organisms like elephants. These striking similarities in metabolic pathways are likely due to their early appearance in evolutionary history, and their retention because of their efficacy.|$|E
5|$|Areoles {{are highly}} {{specialized}} and very condensed shoots or branches. In a normal shoot, nodes bearing leaves or flowers would be separated by lengths of stem (internodes). In an areole, the nodes {{are so close}} together, they form a single structure. The areole may be circular, elongated into an oval shape, or even separated into two parts; the two parts may be visibly connected in some way (e.g. by a groove in the stem) or appear entirely separate (a dimorphic areole). The part nearer {{the top of the}} stem then produces flowers, the other part spines. Areoles often have <b>multicellular</b> hairs (trichomes) that give the areole a hairy or woolly appearance, sometimes of a distinct color such as yellow or brown.|$|E
5|$|Cell theory {{states that}} the cell is the {{fundamental}} unit of life, that all living things are composed {{of one or more}} cells, and that all cells arise from other cells through cell division. In <b>multicellular</b> organisms, every cell in the organism's body derives ultimately from a single cell in a fertilized egg. The cell is also considered to be the basic unit in many pathological processes. In addition, the phenomenon of energy flow occurs in cells in processes {{that are part of the}} function known as metabolism. Finally, cells contain hereditary information (DNA), which is passed from cell to cell during cell division. Research into the origin of life, abiogenesis, amounts to an attempt to discover the origin of the first cells.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{is used as}} a {{neurotransmitter}} in most <b>multicellular</b> animals. In sponges {{there is}} only a single report of the presence of dopamine, with no indication of its function; however, dopamine has been reported in the nervous systems of many other radially symmetric species, including the cnidarian jellyfish, hydra and some corals. This dates the emergence of dopamine as a neurotransmitter back to the earliest appearance of the nervous system, over 500 million years ago in the Cambrian era. Dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter in vertebrates, echinoderms, arthropods, molluscs, and several types of worm.|$|E
5|$|Even {{more complex}} {{morphological}} changes are sometimes possible. For example, when starved of amino acids, Myxobacteria detect surrounding cells {{in a process}} known as quorum sensing, migrate towards each other, and aggregate to form fruiting bodies up to 500micrometres long and containing approximately 100,000 bacterial cells. In these fruiting bodies, the bacteria perform separate tasks; this type of cooperation is a simple type of <b>multicellular</b> organisation. For example, about one in ten cells migrate {{to the top of a}} fruiting body and differentiate into a specialised dormant state called a myxospore, which is more resistant to drying and other adverse environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{innovation}} {{may sometimes}} begin in Lamarckian style with epigenetic alterations of gene regulation or phenotype generation, subsequently consolidated by {{changes at the}} gene level. Epigenetic changes include modification of DNA by reversible methylation, as well as nonprogrammed remoulding of the organism by physical and other environmental effects due to the inherent plasticity of developmental mechanisms. The biologists Stuart A. Newman and Gerd B. Müller have suggested that organisms early {{in the history of}} <b>multicellular</b> life were more susceptible to this second category of epigenetic determination than are modern organisms, providing a basis for early macroevolutionary changes.|$|E
5|$|Genes are {{regulated}} {{so that they}} are expressed only when the product is needed, since expression draws on limited resources. A cell regulates its gene expression depending on its external environment (e.g. available nutrients, temperature and other stresses), its internal environment (e.g. cell division cycle, metabolism, infection status), and its specific role if in a <b>multicellular</b> organism. Gene expression can be regulated at any step: from transcriptional initiation, to RNA processing, to post-translational modification of the protein. The regulation of lactose metabolism genes in E. coli (lac operon) was the first such mechanism to be described in 1961.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these universal functions, the plasma membrane has a more specific role in <b>multicellular</b> organisms. Glycoproteins on the membrane assist the cell in recognizing other cells, in order to exchange metabolites and form tissues. Other proteins on the plasma membrane allow attachment to the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix; a function that maintains cell shape and fixes the location of membrane proteins. Enzymes that catalyze reactions are also found on the plasma membrane. Receptor proteins on the membrane have a shape that matches with a chemical messenger, resulting in various cellular responses.|$|E
5|$|In <b>multicellular</b> eukaryotes, {{cells in}} {{different}} organs and tissues have different patterns of gene expression and therefore have {{different sets of}} enzymes (known as isozymes) available for metabolic reactions. This provides a mechanism for regulating the overall metabolism of the organism. For example, hexokinase, the first enzyme in the glycolysis pathway, has a specialized form called glucokinase expressed in the liver and pancreas that has a lower affinity for glucose yet is more sensitive to glucose concentration. This enzyme is involved in sensing blood sugar and regulating insulin production.|$|E
5|$|Like most brown algae, Postelsia {{goes through}} {{alternation}} of generations, {{and is an}} annual species. The diploid sporophyte produces, through meiosis, haploid spores, which drip down through the grooves in the blades onto the substrate, which may be mussels, barnacles, or bare rock. These spores develop, through mitosis, into small, <b>multicellular</b> haploid gametophytes, male and female. The male and female gametophytes create sperm and eggs, respectively. The sperm of the male reaches the female egg and fertilizes, resulting in a diploid zygote, which develops into a new sporophyte.|$|E
5|$|Many ligand {{transport}} proteins bind particular small biomolecules {{and transport}} {{them to other}} locations {{in the body of}} a <b>multicellular</b> organism. These proteins must have a high binding affinity when their ligand is present in high concentrations, but must also release the ligand when it is present at low concentrations in the target tissues. The canonical example of a ligand-binding protein is haemoglobin, which transports oxygen from the lungs to other organs and tissues in all vertebrates and has close homologs in every biological kingdom. Lectins are sugar-binding proteins which are highly specific for their sugar moieties. Lectins typically play a role in biological recognition phenomena involving cells and proteins. Receptors and hormones are highly specific binding proteins.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybin is a {{tryptamine}} compound with {{a chemical}} structure containing an indole ring {{linked to an}} ethylamine substituent. It is chemically related to the amino acid tryptophan, and is structurally similar to the neurotransmitter serotonin. Psilocybin {{is a member of}} the general class of tryptophan-based compounds that originally functioned as antioxidants in earlier life forms before assuming more complex functions in <b>multicellular</b> organisms, including humans. Other related indole-containing psychedelic compounds include dimethyltryptamine, found in many plant species and in trace amounts in some mammals, and bufotenine, found in the skin of psychoactive toads.|$|E
5|$|The {{advent of}} {{photosynthesis}} in very basic forms of plant life worldwide allowed the sun's energy {{to be harvested}} to create conditions allowing for more complex life. The resultant oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere and {{gave rise to the}} ozone layer. The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of yet more complex cells called eukaryotes. Cells within colonies became increasingly specialized, resulting in true <b>multicellular</b> organisms. With the ozone layer absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation, life colonized the surface of Earth.|$|E
