40|$|Investigation of {{magnetic}} fields in <b>medium</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>switchgears</b> (up to 40 kV) becomes a strongly topical business, which has several reasons. Nowadays, various switchgears and substations {{of this kind}} are often installed in densely populated areas (for example in buildings for commercial purposes etc.) and may represent a danger associated with their possibly negative influencing of near low current and telecommunication devices as well as living organisms. Because {{of a lot of}} various uncertainties in this domain practically all developed countries accepted corresponding standards that, nevertheless, still substantially differ from one another. The unambiguous trend is (at least within the European Union), however, their unification. Manufacturers and operators of the mentioned appliances must certify them, accordingly, i. e. must guarantee the maximum values of field quantities in its neighborhood. This may be realized by either measurements (that is, however, time consuming, expensive and, under common operation conditions, often complicated) or numerical simulations.

40|$|Self-Propagating High-Temperature Synthesis (SHS), {{also called}} {{combustion}} synthesis is an exothermic and self-sustained reaction between the constituents, which has assumed {{significance for the}} production of ceramics and ceramic-metallic materials (cermets), because it is a very rapid processing technique without the need of complex furnaces. However, one of the drawbacks of this route is the high porosity of the final product (typically 50 %). This implies the need for a subsequent densification stage, e. g. by pressing. Combustion synthesized cermets such as TiC-based graded or TiB 2 based cermets can provide a good option for the fabrication of functionally graded material (FGM) components, e. g. to be used in armor applications (TiC based cermets) or for high and <b>medium</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>switchgears</b> (TiB 2 -based cermets). Self sustained High- Temperature Reactions (SHR) involve the initiation, and the subsequent propagation of a reaction front, the reaction being driven by heat release. Heat release from these reactions is potentially interesting for high temperature welding and brazing operations. Initiation of these reactions can take place by e. g. electrostatic discharge, mechanical (impact and shear) and thermal means. SHR might have applications in semi-conducting bridge and exploding foil initiators. Finally, these reactions might also have industrial relevance {{for the production of}} pyrotechnic delays.

40|$|Today, {{manufacturers}} of <b>medium</b> <b>voltage</b> equipment {{are searching for}} alternatives to sulfur hexafluoride (SF$_ 6 $) as the insulating gas. The advantageous thermal and molecular properties make it suitable as an insulating gas, however, it is a strong green house gas. With the present climate challenges, one of the measures of reducing emission of climate gases is to phase out the use of SF$_ 6 $-insulated <b>medium</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>switchgears.</b> An environmentally friendly alternative is air, which has a lower withstand voltage than SF$_ 6 $. For backwards compatibility, the primary manufacturers in this development is optimization (to compensate for lower withstand) of current designs without increasing the dimensions. This work have investigated the breakdown voltage and optical detected partial discharges activity during AC stress in ambient air. The measurements {{have been carried out}} for two cylindrically symmetric test objects, containing triple junctions. These measurements have been supplemented by electric field simulations carried out in COMSOL Multiphysics. Various gap distances between the electrodes have been tested. Correlation between gap distance, breakdown voltage, partial discharge activity, and inception voltage have been determined. The withstand voltage of the investigated test objects proved to have a higher value than the dimensioning withstand voltage for streamer propagation in a sphere-plane arrangement. Characteristic pattern of the partial discharge activity, optically detected with a photomultiplier tube, align with the commonly observed phase-resolved pattern for gliding discharges along a surface of a solid dielectric in air.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a partial discharge measurement system that utilises a multiplexed approach to ultra-high-frequency monitoring on many pieces of equipment using a single cable loop connected to only two sampling channels.

Conventionally, ultra-high-frequency monitoring of high voltage systems has used an array of sensors installed on each unit to facilitate PD location within the unit. The proposed system allows multiple small units to be monitored simultaneously, thus potentially spreading the cost of the measurement hardware across many pieces of equipment. This capability comes at the expense of limiting the partial discharge location capability to a particular item of plant rather than to a specific location within it...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that in non-hermetically sealed <b>medium</b> <b>voltage</b> oil insulated <b>switchgear</b> (MV OIS), the insulating oil will absorb water from the ambient air. The humidity of oil highly influences the breakdown voltage of oil. The humidity of oil, in turn, is influenced by the acidity of oil which will change during the aging processes of oil. Moreover, experience on the influence of copper due to switching actions of switchgear on the chemical and electrical aging process of oil is rare. Chemical and electrical aging of oil can influence the humidity and breakdown voltage (BDV) of oil. To address this situation, it is necessary to determine the influence of changing properties of oil on the BDV of said oil in switchgear. The goal of the research is {{to reduce the risk of}} breakdown of oil in OIS. Therefore, this thesis focuses on the BDV of insulating oil and quantifies the influence of related factors on the BDV of oil.

In our work, such steps were followed: literature review, basic designs, calculation and analysis. The investigation results showed the feasibility of 40. 5 kV/ 2 kA VIS, assuming that the thermal design and material choice are done carefully in order to fulfill the requirements: insulation rating, life time and rated current.
