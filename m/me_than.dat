Tell him to do everything within his power to help you, and that nothing would be more pleasing to <b>me</b> <b>than</b> to see this livery on each of my children. They should all strive to make reparation for the outrages my Son is subjected to in the sacrament of his love. See the graces that will be poured forth on those who will wear it with confidence and help you to spread this devotion.|$|E
25|$|The {{sense of}} {{something}} being missing on Aliens was greater for <b>me</b> <b>than</b> on The Abyss, where the film just got consistently better as the cut got along. The film must {{function as a}} dramatic, organic whole. When I cut the film together, things that read well on paper, on a conceptual level, didn't necessarily translate to the screen as well. I felt I was losing something by breaking my focus. Breaking the story's focus and coming off the main characters was a far greater detriment to the film than what was gained. The film keeps the same message intact at a thematic level, not at a really overt level, by working in a symbolic way.|$|E
25|$|I cannot {{forget that}} ever since I {{was a child}} Fitzwilliam has been, in all situations, my warmest and most affectionate friend, and {{the person in the}} world of whom decidedly I have the best opinion, and so in most respects I have still, but as a {{politician}} I cannot reconcile his conduct with what I (who have known him for more than five-and-thirty years) have always thought to be his character. I think they have all behaved very ill to me, and for most of them, who certainly owe much more to <b>me</b> <b>than</b> I do to them, I feel nothing but contempt, and do not trouble myself about them; but Fitzwilliam is an exception indeed.|$|E

25|$|I {{think every}} {{director}} {{thinks that he}} hasn't been allowed to make the films he wanted to make. I certainly haven't {{been able to make}} as many Westerns as I've wanted. (But) sometimes staying alive in a career sense is very important, and you think, 'Maybe I'll do this, which will do well and allow me to do that.' It's very easy to miscalculate. It's a dangerous game. But I think in the end, none of us have anybody to blame except ourselves. It can be very hard. The kinds of things that directors most want to do are usually not things the studio perceives to be commercially viable. It really is that simple. Is that true of me? Sure. Absolutely. But it's no more true of <b>me</b> <b>than</b> 50 other people I know.|$|E

500|$|According to Jayson Rodriguez of MTV, {{the video}} is [...] "a mix of goth bondage-esque voyeurism, {{complete}} with Rihanna's gyrating moves and a raging band that features Travis Barker on the drums." [...] Shortly after the video was released, Slash {{said that he was}} [...] "flattered" [...] that Rihanna had impersonated him in the video, saying [...] "The video is way better with her being <b>me</b> <b>than</b> with me being me...all things considered, it brings an element of sexuality to it that I probably wouldn't have been capable of.

500|$|Steiger was so {{devoted to}} his craft that during the 1970s he turned to many foreign productions, {{especially}} in Italy, to obtain the sort of roles he desired, but often clashed with directors over his method acting techniques. In {{one of his last}} interviews, Steiger said: [...] "What is the greatest thing an artist in any profession can give to a person?—that would be a constructive, warm memory. Because that gets into your brain and therefore into your life, so to speak. And that's it, when somebody says to me 'I'll never forget', that's worth more to <b>me</b> <b>than</b> five Academy Awards, I'm in that person's life".|$|E
500|$|Just {{before the}} birth of their only child, {{daughter}} Irene, Szigeti found himself stuck in Berlin during the Kapp Putsch of 1920, unable to return to Geneva. The entire city had been paralyzed by a general strike, and the trains were not running. His scheduled concert could not go on as planned, but he was forced to stay in Berlin for [...] "interminable days" [...] while the Putsch ran its course. Szigeti writes: [...] "... the impossibility of communicating by phone or wire with my wife--whose condition I pictured with the somewhat lurid pessimism usual to young prospective fathers--was certainly a greater torment to <b>me</b> <b>than</b> all the other discomforts put together".|$|E

500|$|Rowntree {{stated that}} the band decided to give Coxon a much freer hand on Blur. Street also {{observed}} a change of Albarn's writing style, as he [...] "was much more prepared to write in the first person, rather than about interesting characters. I think [...] grown a bit and was prepared to start writing about his own experiences rather than transposing them on to a character like Tracy Jacks or Dan Abnormal." [...] Coxon agreed, and felt [...] "Damon's songs were revealing more to <b>me</b> <b>than</b> to him" [...] and {{said that when he}} heard some of his home demos he realised [...] "he'd obviously gone off his head a bit more". The album features the first song to appear on a studio album in which Coxon not only wrote the lyrics, but also sang lead vocal—"You're So Great".|$|E
500|$|Stevenson {{described}} {{the character of}} Marion as [...] "cranky, stubborn and lonely", saying that living alone has made her [...] "become quite idiotic and eccentric". When the character of April arrives, Stevenson explains that [...] "Marion has to go from nought to 80 in terms of parenting. There are lots of reasons she wouldn't get it right" [...] which leads on to the guilt and anxiety that Marion suffers when April runs away. Stevenson compared her own difficulties of parenting to Marion's, saying [...] "it is easier for <b>me</b> <b>than</b> someone like Marion because I have had 14 years experience". Richards spoke {{of the character of}} April, saying that [...] "the residential schools and children's homes were completely different from my life. [...] doesn't feel connected to anybody and she struggles to know who she is".|$|E
500|$|While Burger's Daughter {{was still}} banned in South Africa, a copy was smuggled into Nelson Mandela's prison cell on Robben Island, {{and later a}} message was sent out {{saying that he had}} [...] "thought well of it". Gordimer said, [...] "That means more to <b>me</b> <b>than</b> any other opinion it could have gained." [...] Mandela also {{requested}} a meeting with her, and she applied several times to visit him on the Island, but was declined each time. She was, however, at the prison gates waiting for him when he was released in 1990, and she was amongst the first he wanted to talk to. In 2007 Gordimer sent Mandela an inscribed copy of Burger's Daughter to [...] "replace the 'imprisoned' copy", and in it she thanked him for his opinion of the book, and for [...] "untiringly leading the struggle".|$|E

Steve Dunn also became a successful horse trainer, winning two World Grand Championships, the first before his father won one. Steve Dunn's winning horses were Motown Magic in 1989, and Out On Parole in 2002. Bud and Steve Dunn remain the only father and son to win World Grand Championships within the Tennessee Walking Horse industry. When Bud won his first World Grand Championship in 1992, three years after his son's first, Steve said, [...] "I think him winning meant more to <b>me</b> <b>than</b> when I won it." [...] Bud Dunn said of his partnership with Steve, [...] "I always wanted him to work out here. But ain't many fathers and sons ever got along that long." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{his release}} in 1960, Greenglass {{and his family}} lived in New York City under an assumed name. For some years they lived on 228th Street in Laurelton, Queens, New York. In 1996, Greenglass recanted his sworn {{testimony}} {{in an interview with}} The New York Times reporter Sam Roberts and stated he had lied under oath about the extent of his sister's involvement in the spying plot in order to protect his wife. At the trial, Greenglass had testified that Ethel Rosenberg typed his notes to give to the Russians, though he now intimated that Ruth had done the typing, saying [...] "I frankly think my wife did the typing, but I don't remember." [...] Greenglass explained, [...] "My wife is more important to <b>me</b> <b>than</b> my sister. Or my mother or my father, O.K.? And she was the mother of my children." [...] When Roberts asked Greenglass if he would have done anything differently, he replied, [...] "Never." [...] The role of Ethel Rosenberg in her husband's espionage ring remains a matter of dispute.|$|E
500|$|Ultima Underworld is {{considered}} the first example of an immersive sim, a genre that combines elements from other genres to create a game with strong player agency and emergent gameplay, and has influence many games since its release. The game's influence {{has been found in}} BioShock (2007), and that game's designer, Ken Levine, has stated that [...] "all the things that I wanted to do and all the games that I ended up working on came out of the inspiration I took from [...]" [...] Gears of War designer Cliff Bleszinski also cited it as an early influence, stating that it had [...] "far more impact on <b>me</b> <b>than</b> Doom". Other games influenced by Ultima Underworld include , Deus Ex, , , and Half-Life 2. Toby Gard stated that, when designing Tomb Raider, he [...] "was a big fan of ... Ultima Underworld and I wanted to mix that type of game with the sort of polygon characters that were just being showcased in Virtua Fighter." [...] Ultima Underworld was also the basis for Looking Glass Technologies' later System Shock.|$|E
