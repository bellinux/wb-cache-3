40|$|Oral {{tolerance}} induction is a {{key feature}} of intestinal immunity, generating systemic nonresponsiveness to ingested antigens. In this study, we report that orally applied soluble antigens are exclusively recognized in the intestinal immune system, particularly in the <b>mesenteric</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> Consequently, the initiation of oral tolerance is impeded by mesenteric lymphadenectomy. Small bowel transplantation reveals that <b>mesenteric</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> require afferent <b>lymph</b> to accomplish the recognition of orally applied antigens. Finally, oral tolerance cannot be induced in CCR 7 -deficient mice that display impaired migration of dendritic cells from the intestine to the <b>mesenteric</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> suggesting that immunologically relevant antigen is transported in a cell-bound fashion.

40|$|The {{origin of}} {{immunoglobulins}} in mammalian exocrine secretions {{has been a}} subject of considerable recent interest. The secretory IgA that is found in high concentrations in intestinal secretions, saliva, tears, milk, etc. has been assumed to be derived directly from local synthesis rather than from other secretory tissues via the serum. Support for this hypothesis is provided by adoptive transfer experiments that have shown a preferential migration of thoracic duct lymphoblasts or <b>mesenteric</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> lymphoblasts to mucosal lymphoid tissue, particularly the gut (1, 2). In addition, Roux et al. (3) and Lamm et al. (4) have observed that the <b>mesenteric</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> lymphoblasts can selectively lodge in the mammary gland of the lactating mouse. Further, these same studies indicate that the migrating cells from the <b>mesenteric</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> bear surface IgA and are already committed to IgA synthesis.

To evaluate the cell-mediated response to oral sensitization, outbred Hartley guinea pigs were fed pasteurized milk (100 ml/day) for a 2 - 4 week sensitization period. An in vitro proliferation assay was used to examine the antigen-specific responses in sensitized lymphocytes from spleen, <b>mesenteric</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> and blood. Peripheral blood and <b>mesenteric</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> lymphocytes were quite responsive whereas splenocytes responded poorly. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from orally sensitized guinea pigs responded significantly (p 0. 05). Even two months after the oral exposure, <b>mesenteric</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> lymphocytes still proliferated significantly (p< 0. 05), when cultured with cc and 0 caseins. However, reseeding cow's milk to guinea pigs didn't increase the proliferate response, and may even have induced suppression. Our results suggest that the optimum length of time required for oral sensitization is 2 weeks. Caseins (cc and 0) and 0 -lactoglobulin induced a significantly higher proliferate response after 2 weeks of oral sensitization. However, prolonged feeding for 4 weeks with cow's milk downregulated the antigenic response and upregulated the mitogenic response to a polyclonal T cell mitogen (Con A). T cell enrichment prior to culture demonstrated that the increased proliferation in nonenfiched T cell populations was influenced by antigen presenting cells. Using flow cytometric analysis, the study revealed a marked difference in the distribution of phenotypic markers in peripheral blood, spleen, and <b>mesenteric</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> of guinea pigs fed cow's milk for varying periods of time. Two weeks of oral sensitization yielded more T lymphocytes in spleen, with a predominance of the CD 8 subset in the <b>mesenteric</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> and spleen. On the other hand, 3 weeks of sensitization resulted in fewer CD 8 + T cells in the circulation and <b>mesenteric</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> which, in turn, correlated directly with the ability to enhance the lymphoproliferative reaction. Overall, this study demonstrated {{for the first time that}} the oral sensitization with cow's milk can induce antigenic-specific T lymphocyte responses in both local and systemic lymphoid compartments. Caseins (cc and 0) and 0 lactoglobulin were found to be the most common sensitizing T cell antigens in orally sensitized guinea pigs. The lymphocyte stimulation assay with highly purified antigens could be useful in the diagnosis of cow's milk allergy in humans...|$|E

Treatment with streptomycin plus bacitracin decreased the anaerobic bacterial levels in these gnotobiotic mice, allowing increased population levels of E. coli C 25 and increased translocation to the <b>mesenteric</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> E. coli C 25 also translocated to the <b>mesenteric</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> of specific-pathogen-free mice treated with streptomycin and bacitracin before colonization with E. coli C 25.
