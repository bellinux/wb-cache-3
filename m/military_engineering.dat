5|$|Development of the {{military}} settlement at Tvrđa started in 1687 when the Habsburg armies drove the Ottomans {{out of the city}} during the Great Turkish War. The chief commander of the Imperial army, Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden, saw Osijek as a location of exceptional strategic importance in the war against the Ottomans. He urged the repair of the city walls, and proposed construction of a new fort according to Vauban's principles of <b>military</b> <b>engineering.</b>|$|E
5|$|Higher {{education}} in the city {{can be traced back}} to the second half of the eighteenth century, when the ownership of the city was inherited by Field Crown Hetman Jan Klemens Branicki. As a patron of the arts and sciences, Branicki encouraged numerous artists and scientists to settle in Białystok to take advantage of Branicki's patronage. In 1745 Branicki established Poland's first military college, the School of Civil and <b>Military</b> <b>Engineering,</b> in the city.|$|E

5|$|John Capper {{was born}} in Lucknow, India to civil servant William Copeland Capper and his wife Sarah in December 1861. Returning to England {{at an early age}} for education, Capper {{attended}} Wellington College and upon leaving in 1880 enrolled in the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich from where he went on to study at the School of <b>Military</b> <b>Engineering</b> at Chatham, before subsequently being commissioned into the Royal Engineers as a lieutenant. A capable engineering officer, Capper served in India and Burma for most of the first 17 years of his career, principally employed on military and public construction projects. He performed well in this position, being promoted to captain in 1889.|$|E
5|$|McNeile did {{not like}} either of his given names but {{preferred}} to be called Cyril, although he was always known by his friends as Mac. After attending a prep school in Eastbourne, he was further educated at Cheltenham College. On leaving the college, he joined the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, from which he was commissioned into the Royal Engineers as a second lieutenant in July 1907. He underwent further training at the Royal School of <b>Military</b> <b>Engineering</b> before a short posting to Aldershot Garrison. He received promotion to lieutenant in June 1910 and was posted to Canterbury, serving three years with the 3rd Field Troop, until January 1914, when he was posted to Malta.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, the Persians adopted war engines from the Romans. The Romans had {{achieved}} and maintained {{a high degree}} of sophistication in siege warfare and had developed a range of siege machines. On the other hand, the Parthians were inept at besieging; their cavalry armies were more suited to the hit-and-run tactics that destroyed Antony's siege train in 36BC. The situation changed with the rise of the Sasanians, when Rome encountered an enemy equally skilled in siegecraft, who made use of artillery, machines captured from the Romans, embankments, siege towers, and in one instance, even an early form of gas warfare inside tunnels. Recent assessments comparing the Sasanians and Parthians have reaffirmed the superiority of Sasanian siegecraft, <b>military</b> <b>engineering,</b> and organization, as well as ability to build defensive works.|$|E

In Riga also the Second Leningrad Higher <b>Military</b> Aviation <b>Engineering</b> School was functioning that had been reorganized from the technical school with similar name. Both schools had two faculties. The first - engineering and special electrical equipment, the second - radio engineering and air armaments. In 1949 both schools were joined in the Riga Higher <b>Military</b> Aviation <b>Engineering</b> School.|$|R

5|$|The first convoy from Belgium, {{carrying}} stateless Jews, left Mechelen {{transit camp}} for Auschwitz on 4 August 1942 {{and was soon}} followed by others. These trains left for extermination camps in Eastern Europe. Between October 1942 and January 1943, deportations were temporarily halted; by this time 16,600 people have been deported on 17 rail convoys. As the result of Queen Elisabeth's intervention with the German authorities, all of those deported in this first wave were not Belgian citizens. In 1943, the deportations resumed. By the time that deportations to extermination camps had begun, however, nearly 2,250 Belgian Jews had already been deported as forced laborers for , a civil and <b>military</b> <b>engineering</b> group, which {{was working on the}} construction of the Atlantic Wall in Northern France.|$|E
5|$|In August 1907, MacArthur {{was sent}} to the {{engineer}} district office in Milwaukee, where his parents were living. In April 1908, he was posted to Fort Leavenworth, where he was given his first command, Company K, 3rd Engineer Battalion. He became battalion adjutant in 1909 and then engineer officer at Fort Leavenworth in 1910. MacArthur was promoted to captain in February 1911 and was appointed as head of the <b>Military</b> <b>Engineering</b> Department and the Field Engineer School. He participated in exercises at San Antonio, Texas, with the Maneuver Division in 1911 and served in Panama on detached duty in January and February 1912. The sudden death of their father on 5 September 1912 brought Douglas and his brother Arthur back to Milwaukee to care for their mother, whose health had deteriorated. MacArthur requested a transfer to Washington, D.C. so his mother could be near Johns Hopkins Hospital. Army Chief of Staff, Major General Leonard Wood, took up the matter with Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, who arranged for MacArthur to be posted to the Office of the Chief of Staff in 1912.|$|E
5|$|Sturdee {{embarked}} for Australia on 16 November 1918, and his AIF {{appointment was}} terminated on 14 March 1919.

He was given the brevet rank of lieutenant colonel on 1 January 1920, but this did not become substantive until 1 April 1932. Sturdee initially served as Senior Engineer Officer {{on the staff of}} the 3rd Military District at Victoria Barracks, Melbourne. In 1921, he attended the Staff College at Quetta in British India. He was an instructor in <b>military</b> <b>engineering</b> and surveying at the Royal Military College, Duntroon from 16 February to 31 December 1924, before returning to Melbourne to serve {{on the staff of the}} 4th Division until 26 March 1929. Posted to the United Kingdom, he served at the War Office and attended the Imperial Defence College in 1931.

25|$|Civil {{engineering}} {{is a professional}} engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including works like roads, bridges, canals, dams, and buildings. Civil {{engineering is}} traditionally broken {{into a number of}} sub-disciplines. It is the second-oldest engineering discipline after <b>military</b> <b>engineering,</b> and it is defined to distinguish non-military engineering from <b>military</b> <b>engineering.</b> Civil engineering takes place in the public sector from municipal through to national governments, and in the private sector from individual homeowners through to international companies.|$|E
25|$|Also, the {{academician}} Boris Galerkin took a general's {{uniform in}} 1939, {{as the head}} of VITU's structural mechanics department became a lieutenant general.

25|$|Roman <b>military</b> <b>engineering</b> took both {{routine and}} {{extraordinary}} forms, the former a proactive part of standard military procedure, {{and the latter}} of an extraordinary or reactionary nature. Proactive <b>military</b> <b>engineering</b> {{took the form of}} the regular construction of fortified camps, in road-building, and in the construction of siege engines. The knowledge and experience learned through such routine engineering lent itself readily to any extraordinary engineering projects required by the army, such as the circumvallations constructed at Alesia and the earthen ramp constructed at Masada.|$|E
