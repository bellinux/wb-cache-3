40|$|Hydrophobic sand is a {{relatively}} new method of urine collection in the rodent, comparable to the established method using a <b>metabolic</b> <b>cage.</b> Urine samples are often used in rodent research, especially for biomarkers of health changes after internal contamination from embedded metals, such as in a model of a military shrapnel wound. However, little research has been done on the potential interference of hydrophobic sand with urine metal concentrations either by contamination from the sand particulate, or adsorption of metals from the urine. We compare urine collected from rats using the <b>metabolic</b> <b>cage</b> method and the hydrophobic sand method for differences in metal concentration of common urinary metals, and examine physical properties of the sand material for potential sources of contamination. We found minimal risk of internal contamination of the rat by hydrophobic sand, and no interference of the sand with several common metals of interest (cobalt, strontium, copper, and manganese), although we advise caution in studies of aluminum in urine...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of <b>metabolic</b> <b>cage</b> housing on the Wistar rat physiological state and to analyze the correlation between the minerals in blood and urine. Thirty male rats were used in the experiment. Fifteen rats (control group) were housed individually in standard polycarbonate cages and fifteen rats (experimental group) in metabolic cages (Techniplast, Italy) for two weeks. Body weight, respiration rate, water and food consumptions were recorded for each animal at the beginning of the experiment. The same parameters, as well as blood and urine parameters of control and experimental animals were recorded during the experiment after 72 h, 168 h and 336 h of housing in standard cages and metabolic cages. Urine collection was measured only in the experimental group. Rats weight decreased from 3. 84 % to 18. 59 % (P< 0. 05), respiration rate from 18. 65 % to 24. 59 % (P< 0. 05) when rats were housed in metabolic cages. Consumption of food and water by the rat depended on how long the animal was kept in <b>metabolic</b> <b>cage.</b> Glucose concentration increased on average by 15. 37 %, WBC count decreased by 5. 83 % in the blood of rats housed in metabolic cages compared to the animals housed in standard cages. We did not observe significant changes of triglycerides concentration, red blood cells count and total protein between all rats. The positive moderate correlation of rat housing in a <b>metabolic</b> <b>cage</b> was between K blood and K urine, P blood and P urine, Na blood and K blood, between Na urine and P urine and significant negative moderate correlation was determined between K urine and P urine.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to compare the apparent digestibility coefficients of a commercial dog food, fecal consistency and behavior of dogs housed in kennels and <b>metabolic</b> <b>cages.</b> Six adult Beagle dogs were distributed in cross-over experimental design, with six replicates per treatment. Dogs were housed in two environments: <b>metabolic</b> <b>cages</b> and in masonry kennels with solarium. Dogs were fed for a five-day adaptation period, and the five following days were used for total feces collection. Dogs behavior was recorded during a 48 -h period, with 10 -min intervals. Apparent digestibility coefficients were not different between treatments. However, dogs housed in <b>metabolic</b> <b>cages</b> produced lower weight and more consistent feces as compared with dogs housed in kennels. Dogs spent most of the time sleeping in both housing systems; however, dogs housed in the <b>metabolic</b> <b>cages</b> slept more than those in kennels. Stress-related behaviors (barking, whimpering, stereotypies, etc) were observed for no longer than 15 minutes per day, and were not different between dogs in kennels or in cages.

40|$|A new rat model (suspension and immobilization) is {{described}} for induction of hypokinesia and orthostatic manipulations.

During seven days of hypokinesia there was an atrophy of the gastrocnemius and increased excretion of urinary nitrogeneous end products.

40|$|Coprophagy (i. e., {{consumption}} of feces) is a behavior seen in rodents and other animal species. This behavior can substantially influence the enterohepatic cycling of compounds, including bile salts. Since many studies involve the feeding of rodents with bile salt supplemented diets, {{it is of}} importance to know the influence of coprophagy on bile salt composition in such studies. We compared the peripheral and portal bile salt composition of mice in conventional and <b>metabolic</b> <b>cages</b> when fed a control diet or a diet containing 0. 5 % cholate. We also performed these experiments with Atp 8 b 1 -deficient mice {{as it has been}} suggested that in the absence of this transporter bile salt absorption in the intestine would be increased. In mice on a control diet there is little difference in bile salt composition between conventional housing and metabolic housing. Metabolic housing led to a near complete disappearance of the low levels of dihydroxy bile salts (i. e., deoxycholate + chenodeoxycholate) in peripheral serum. In mice fed a control diet, the portal blood concentration of unconjugated dihydroxy bile salts was extremely low (< 2 %), but these rose to about 10 % when mice were fed a cholate-supplemented diet. In <b>metabolic</b> <b>cages</b> the portal blood content of these unconjugated dihydroxy bile salts was reduced to undetectable levels.

40|$|Space {{allowance}} is {{an important}} factor in adapta-tion to the environment. Confinement, lasting for weeks, can chronically increase plasma cortisol con-centration (e. g. Warnier and Paquay, 1983; Štuhec, 1984; Becker et al., 1985 a; Janssens et al., 1994). e examples of extreme confinement are <b>metabolic</b> <b>cages,</b> often used in nutrition experiments. Other important factors in adaptation are social contacts and control of the environment. Social isolation increased plasma cortisol concentration (Štuhec, 1984) and social isolation together with reduced visual control of the environment increased corti-sol response to exogenous ACTH (Janssens et al., 1994). Lower basal cortisol concentrations were observed in a positive human-animal relationship, indicating that positive contacts can obviate some of the negative effects of the environment (Pedersen et al., 1998). Another important factor in reduc-ing plasma cortisol concentration is previous ex-perience with the stressful environment. Only an initial increase in plasma cortisol concentration was observed in lambs in <b>metabolic</b> <b>cages</b> that had previous experience with <b>metabolic</b> <b>cages</b> and were habituated to the contact with human beings (Kapp et al., 1997).

Adult female Wistar rats, kept in <b>metabolic</b> <b>cages,</b> were intraperitoneally infused for 2, 4, 8 or 16 days with leptin (10 nmol/kg. 24 h); control animals were infused with the vehicle only. The rate of body-weight gain was similar in control and leptin-infused rats. At day 16 of treatment relative pituitary weight was higher and relative adrenal weight smaller in leptin-infused than control rats. Pituitary ACTH concentration gradually decreased with the duration of treatment, and the drop was significantly higher in leptin-infused than control rats. During the entire experimental period the blood level of aldosterone was similar in both groups of rats. Conversely, at days 2 and 4 of treatment the blood concentration of corticosterone was lower in leptin-infused than in control rats, which at these times displayed elevated levels of circulating corticosterone. Taken together, these findings allow us to conclude that in the rat the prolonged infusion of low doses of leptin i) primarily depresses pituitary ACTH production, the effect being probably mediated by the hypothalamus; and ii) inhibits corticosterone response to the stress evoked by placing of animals in the <b>metabolic</b> <b>cages...</b>|$|R
