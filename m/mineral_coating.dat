40|$|ABSTRACT: Reattachment of tendon to bone {{has been}} a {{challenge}} in orthopedic surgery. The disparate mechanical properties of the two tissues {{make it difficult to}} achieve direct surgical repair of the tendon-to-bone insertion. Healing after surgical repair typically does not regenerate the natural attachment, a complex tissue that connects tendon and bone across a gradient in both mineral content and cell phenotypes. To facilitate the regeneration of the attachment, our groups have developed a nanofiber-based scaffold with a graded <b>mineral</b> <b>coating</b> to mimic the mineral composition of the native tendon-to-bone insertion. In the present work, we evaluated the ability of this scaffold to induce graded osteogenesis of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs). Results from 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenylte-trazolium bromide assay and proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining indicated that cell proliferation was negatively correlated with the mineral content. In contrast, alkaline phosphatase staining, an indicator of osteogenesis, was positively correlated with the mineral content. Likewise, runt-related transcription factor 2 (an early marker of osteoblast differentiation) and osteocalcin (a late marker of osteoblast differentiation) immunostaining were both positively correlated with the mineral content. These results indicate that a gradient in mineral content on the surface of a nanofiber scaffold is capable of inducing graded differentiation of ASCs into osteoblasts for enthesis repair...|$|E

A comprehensive characterization based on viscous flow curves, dynamic shear temperature sweeps, standardized technological tests, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and optical microscopy analysis was conducted on EVA-binders with 5 and 7. 5 wt. % EVA. Low VA contents proved to endow bitumen with improved performance at medium-high in-service temperatures.

40|$|Located at the {{southern}} section of the Artic Mid-Ocean Ridge, the Jan Mayen Vent Fields (JMVF) consist of three main hydrothermal sites, the Troll Wall, Perle & Bruse and Soria Moria. These sites contain numerous Fe-deposits, located distal to high-temperature venting sites. A recent study of such Fe-deposits from the Troll Wall reports of abundant neutrophilic Fe-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB), at locations with active low-temperature venting. The same study suggests that the stratified structure, and textural and chemical variations of the laminae and layers of the deposits reflect changes in physicochemical conditions (i. e. temperature, fluid dynamics, pH, nutrient availability), which govern the formation processes, such as habitability and growth of biomineralizing FeOB, and abiotic mineralization. In this study samples of Fe-depositsfrom both the Troll Wall and Perle & Bruse vent fields are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and geochemical analysis, {{with the aim of}} establishing possible intra- and inter-field textural and geochemical variations at these sites, and if such variations can be explained by similar physicochemical changes. The textural results reveal that the samples from both fields are built up of stacked sequences of five distinct laminae or laminated layers of different colour, thickness, porosity and microtextures, separated by internal cavities. A yellow and a light brown layer with a highly porous framework of 10 - 50 μm thick, 200 μm to > 1000 μm long bundles of 0. 3 - 1 μm wide fibres, which apparently grew inward from an outer glass-like lamina and into the cavities, form the innermost layers in each sequence. The fibres were likely formed through nucleation onto extracellular polymers (EPS). Secondary <b>mineral</b> <b>coating</b> and attached twisted FeOB stalks on the bundles in the light brown layer suggest a further development from the yellow stage through different biotically and abiotically dominated stages. Clusters of 2 - 3 μm wide, branching tubes (Y-guys) associated with biomineralizing FeOB are mainly converging around the glass-like lamina. Massive, 5 - 15 μm wide, and 50 - 300 μm long unidirectional filamentous structures comprising most of the outermost brown and dark brown layer, are likely formed from connecting nodular, abiotic precipitates, indicating periods of poor biotic growth conditions. Lower amount of secondary <b>mineral</b> <b>coating,</b> stronger branching of Y-guys, and greater general abundance of other likely biosignatures of microaerophilic FeOB in the Perle & Bruse sample suggest better growth conditions at this site. The geochemical data confirm that the samples from both vent fields have a similar composition, with approximately 50 - 80 wt% Fe 2 O 3 and 20 - 35 wt% SiO 2, along with low contents of base metals. Mn is enriched in the surface layer relative to the interior, although the concentration is markedly lower in the Perle & Bruse sample compared to the Troll Wall sample. The enrichment likely reflects Mn-oxyhydroxides precipitation at the oxic surface during periods of hydrothermal quiescence. Thus, the variation in Mn-content between laminae at both sites suggests variations in hydrothermal input throughout the formation of the deposits at both sites, with generally a more intermittent hydrothermal activity at the Troll Wall site than the Perle & Bruse site. Chondrite-normalised REE patterns for the Troll Wall deposit are similar to that of seawater and low-temperature hydrothermal fluid previously reported for this field. However, REE patterns with similarity to Jan Mayen basalts for the Perle & Bruse deposit suggest a higher fluid temperature resulting in stronger leaching of the subsurface rocks at this site. Negative Eu anomalies indicate that the hydrothermal fluid at both sites never reached temperatures above 200 - 250 °C. This study demonstrates that hydrothermal fluctuations and associated shifts in the position of the redox-gradient and nutrient availability likely explain the formation of the laminated structure and the activity of Fe-oxidizing bacteria in marine hydrothermal Fe-deposits. The study also demonstrates that differences in intra-and inter- field textural and chemical composition do exist between the investigated Fe-deposits, and that these differences are likely caused by variation in the venting styles and physicochemical conditions of the hydrothermal fluids. To this end, conceptual models for the formation of the Perle & Bruse and Troll Wall Fedeposits and associated microtextures are proposed...|$|E

Interpretations of U-Pb isotopes in opal samples at Yucca Mountain are complicated by the incorporation of excess {sup 234 }U at the time of mineral formation, resulting in reverse discordance of U-Pb ages. However, the {sup 207 }Pb/{sup 235 }U ages are much less affected by deviation from initial secular equilibrium and provide reliable ages of most silica deposits between 0. 6 and 9. 8 Ma. For chalcedony subsamples showing normal age discordance, these ages may represent minimum times of deposition. Typically, {sup 207 }Pb/{sup 235 }U ages are consistent with the microstratigraphy in the <b>mineral</b> <b>coating</b> samples, such that the youngest ages are for subsamples from outer layers, intermediate ages are from inner layers, and oldest ages are from innermost layers. {sup 234 }U and {sup 230 }Th in most silica layers deeper in the coatings are in secular equilibrium with {sup 238 }U, which is consistent with their old age and closed system behavior during the past 0. 5 m. y. U-Pb ages for subsamples of silica layers from different microstratigraphic positions in individual calcite and silica coating samples collected from lithophysal cavities in the welded part of the Topopah Spring Tuff yield slow long-term average depositional rates of 1 to 5 mm/m. y. These data imply that the deeper parts of the UZ at Yucca Mountain maintained long-term hydrologic stability over the past 10 m. y. despite significant climate variations. U-Pb ages for subsamples of silica layers from different microstratigraphic positions in individual calcite and silica coating samples collected from fractures in the welded part of the overlying Tiva Canyon Tuff indicate larger long-term average depositional rates up to 23 mm/m. y. and an absence of recently deposited materials (ages of outermost layers are 3 - 5 Ma). These differences between the characteristics of the coatings for samples from the shallower and deeper parts of the UZ may indicate that the nonwelded tuffs (PTn), located between the welded parts of the Tiva Canyon and Topopah Spring Tuffs, {{play an important role in}} moderating UZ flow...|$|E
40|$|Biomineralization is {{well-known}} as the essential process for human skeletal development. It {{is a complex}} and multistage process requiring an interaction of many physicochemical factors. It results in highly complex mineral-organic products in which organic and inorganic components are structured on many dimensional scales to form hierarchical architectures. From a mineralogical point of view the concept of biomineral refers not only to mineral produced with the intervention of living organisms but to phases characterized by specific features and properties that distinguish them from their bulk, macroscopic counterparts formed geologically or synthetically. Calcium phosphate phases can be considered the most important class of biominerals. These take place in human body mainly as physiologic products such as bones and teeth but also as pathological products, when their formation occurs outside the normal mineralization sites. In different scientific fields these are generically known with the inappropriate term of calcifications to distinguish them from the products having a precise function in the human body; from a mineralogical point of view this well-defined distinction is not taken to account and all biominerals meet only the criteria for being true minerals. The present thesis addresses the issue of “pathological” calcium phosphate biominerals within valve tissues of the human heart. Nowadays the formation of such biominerals is a worldwide important topic associated with major morbidity, mortality and health economic costs. These represent {{the leading cause of}} failure of natural and bioprosthetic heart valves and the major indication for surgical valve replacement. The mechanisms involved in their deposition are still poorly understood and no medical intervention is able to delay or halt “calcification” progression, thus there is a pressing need to deeply understanding the biomineralization processes linked to these “pathological” calcium phosphate phases. Aim of the present thesis is to provide a comprehensive mineralogical characterization of such calcium phosphate biominerals in an effort to obtain new insights into the factors controlling this biomineralization process and hence to supply a better picture on which to base new hypothesis on the nucleation and growth processes linked to these phases. Composition, morphology, crystallite size and structure are all correlated with their growth conditions; an understanding of their morphological and crystal-chemical features allows to gain valuable information on their crystallization pathways. The main debated issues linked to calcium phosphate biominerals will be discussed, starting from a clarification of the term “bioapatite” used in this study to indicate a well-distinct calcium phosphate phase but often used improperly in different scientific fields. Relevant topics concerning specific features of the nanocrystalline bioapatite will be developed. These include: 1) location of the carbonate group CO 32 - in the bioapatite lattice; 2) carbonate content; 3) hydroxylation degree; 3) bioapatite stoichiometry 4) surface properties; 5) presence of precursor phases; 6) macro- and microstructures; 7) nanocrystals structure. Complementary mineralogical techniques were employed to obtain a comprehensive characterization of this biomineral phase, and a multi-scale investigation, from millimeters to nanometers, has been conducted to define all structural organization levels, typical of biomineral phases. The greatest difficulties linked to the characterization of natural nanocrystalline bioapatites will be also discussed. The complete mineralogical characterization has allowed to determine the lowest units constituting the “pathological” deposits within the valve tissues of the human heart. These are represented by needle- and rod-like nanocrystals showing characteristic aggregation properties {{in a wide range of}} crystallite size associated to local growth conditions and to different mineralization sites. The nucleation and growth mechanisms of the investigated phase seem to be mainly regulated by thermodynamic and physicochemical factors while the role of the organic matrix appears to be mainly limited to a spatial template; both homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation processes appear to be involved in the formation of “pathological” nanocrystals, and in the latter case a surface-induce mineralization process linked to the functionalization of the organic interfaces by negatively charged functional groups can be hypothesized. The presence of the CO 32 - group both in the bioapatite lattice and as labile ions localized at the nanocrystals surface, as well as the presence of the HPO 42 - group, suggests a possible involvement of these functional groups in inducing bioapatite nucleation onto organic substrate and a superficial ionic mobility. This can assume an important role for the chemical interactions of the inorganic phase with the organic matrix and the biological fluids representing a relevant feature for ion exchange processes. Finally, at larger length scales, the three-dimensional arrangement of bioapatite nanocrystals in spherulitic shapes located onto and beside the collagen fibrils, or in the form of uniform <b>mineral</b> <b>coating,</b> seems to be linked to the local density and distribution of the organic network, but also to aggregation processes ruled by surface energy minimization...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Fibronectin (FN) {{has been}} shown to stimulate bone {{regeneration}} in animal models. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the capacity of bovine bone <b>mineral</b> <b>coated</b> with synthetic oligopeptides to enhance bone regeneration in rabbit calvarial defects. Methods: Oligopeptides including fibrin-binding sequences of FN repeats were synthesized on the basis of primary and tertiary human plasma FN structures. Peptide coated and uncoated bone minerals were implanted into 10 mm calvarial defects in New Zealand white rabbits, and the animals were sacrificed at 4 or 8 weeks after surgery. After specimens were prepared, histologic examination and histomorphometric analysis were performed. Results: At 4 weeks after surgery, the uncoated groups showed a limited amount of osteoid formation at the periphery of the defect and the oligopeptide coated groups showed more osteoid formation and new bone formation in the center of the defect as well as at the periphery. At 8 weeks, both sites showed increased new bone formation. However, the difference between the two sites had reduced. Conclusions: Fibrin-binding synthetic oligopeptide derived from FN on deproteinized bovine bone enhanced new bone formation in rabbit calvarial defects at the early healing stage. This result suggests that these oligopeptides can be beneficial in reconstructing oral and maxillofacial deformities or in regenerating osseous bone defects...|$|R
40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the efficacy of}} anorganic bone <b>mineral</b> <b>coated</b> with P- 15 peptide (ABM/P- 15) on tibia defect repair longitudinally in both normal and osteoporotic rats in vivo. A paired design was used. 24 Norwegian brown rats were divided into normal and osteoporotic groups. 48 cylindrical defects were created in proximal tibias bilaterally. Defects were filled with ABM/P- 15 or left empty. Osteoporotic status was assessed by microarchitectural analysis. Microarchitectural properties of proximal tibial defects were evaluated at 4 time points. 21 days after surgery, tibias were harvested for histology and histomorphometry. Significantly increased bone volume fraction, surface density, and connectivity were seen in all groups at days 14 and 21 compared with day 0. Moreover, the structure type of ABM/P- 15 group was changed toward typical plate-like structure. Microarchitectural properties of ABM/P- 15 treated newly formed bones at 21 days were similar in normal and osteoporotic rats. Histologically, significant bone formation was seen in all groups. Interestingly, significantly increased bone formation was seen in osteoporotic rats treated with ABM/P- 15 indicating optimized healing potential. Empty defects showed lower healing potential in osteoporotic bone. In conclusion, ABM/P- 15 accelerated bone regeneration in osteoporotic rats but did not enhance bone regeneration in normal rats...|$|R
50|$|Stray current {{corrosion}} occurs because: 1) {{the piping}} {{system has been}} connected accidentally or intentionally to a DC voltage source; 2) the piping does not have metal-to-metal electrical continuity throughout its length; or 3) if the voltage source is AC, one or more naturally occurring <b>minerals</b> <b>coating</b> the pipe interior may act as a rectifier, converting AC current to DC. The DC voltage forces the water within the piping {{to act as an}} electrical conductor (an electrolyte). Electric current leaves the copper pipe, moves though the water across the nonconductive section (a plastic filter housing, for example), and reenters the pipe on the opposite side. Pitting occurs at the electrically negative side (the cathode), which may happen to be either upstream or downstream with respect to the water flow direction. Pitting occurs because the electrical voltage ionizes the pipe's interior copper metal, which reacts chemically with dissolved minerals in the water, creating copper salts; these copper salts are soluble in water and wash away. Microscopic pits eventually grow and consolidate to form pin holes. When one is discovered, there are almost certainly more that have not yet leaked. A complete discussion of stray current corrosion can be found in chapter 11, section 11.4.3, of Handbook of Corrosion Engineering, by Pierre Roberge.|$|R
