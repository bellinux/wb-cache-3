40|$|Seminal fluid {{represents}} a common biological material recovered from sexual assault crime scenes. Such samples can be prescreened using different techniques to determine cell type and relative amount before submitting for full STR profiling. The ParaDNA(®) Screening System {{is a novel}} forensic test which identifies the presence of DNA through amplification and detection of two common STR loci (D 16 S 539 and TH 01) and the Amelogenin marker. The detection of the Y allele in samples could provide a useful tool in the triage and submission of sexual assault samples by enforcement authorities. <b>Male</b> <b>template</b> material was detected {{on a range of}} common sexual assault evidence items including cotton pillow cases, condoms, swab heads and glass surfaces and shows a detection limit of 1 in 1000 dilution of neat semen. These data indicate this technology {{has the potential to be}} a useful tool for the detection of male donor DNA in sexual assault casework...|$|E
40|$|A {{multiplex}} polymerase {{chain reaction}} (PCR) assay (RM-Yplex) was developed which is capable of simultaneously amplifying 13 recently introduced rapidly mutating Y-STR markers (RM Y-STRs). This multiplex assay is expected to aid human identity testing in forensic and other applications to improve differentiating unrelated males and allow separating related males. The 13 RM Y-STR markers included in the multiplex are: DYF 387 S 1, DYF 399 S 1, DYF 403 S 1 ab, DYF 404 S 1, DYS 449, DYS 518, DYS 526 ab, DYS 547, DYS 570, DYS 576, DYS 612, DYS 626 and DYS 627. This study reflects the proof of concept to analyse all currently known RM Y-STRs simultaneously and describes the optimization of the multiplex assay. The RM-Yplex assay generated complete RM Y-STR profiles down to 62. 5 pg of <b>male</b> <b>template</b> DNA, and from male–female DNA mixtures at all ratios tested. We herewith introduce and make available for widespread use in forensic and anthropological studies, an effective and sensitive single multiplex assay for simultaneous genotyping of 13 RM Y-STRs...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the spatial}} and depth {{sensitivity}} of non-invasive near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurements to brain tissue-i. e., near-infrared neuromonitoring (NIN) - {{is essential for}} designing experiments as well as interpreting research findings. However, a thorough characterization of such sensitivity in realistic head models has remained unavailable. In this study, we conducted 3, 555 Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to densely cover the scalp of a well-characterized, adult <b>male</b> <b>template</b> brain (Colin 27). We sought to evaluate: (i) the spatial sensitivity profile of NIRS to brain tissue {{as a function of}} source-detector separation, (ii) the NIRS sensitivity to brain tissue as a function of depth in this realistic and complex head model, and (iii) the effect of NIRS instrument sensitivity on detecting brain activation. We found that increasing the source-detector (SD) separation from 20 to 65 mm provides monotonic increases in sensitivity to brain tissue. For every 10 mm increase in SD separation (up to ~ 45 mm), sensitivity to gray matter increased an additional 4 %. Our analyses also demonstrate that sensitivity in depth (S) decreases exponentially, with a "rule-of-thumb" formula S= 0. 75 * 0. 85 (depth). Thus, while the depth sensitivity of NIRS is not strictly limited, NIN signals in adult humans are strongly biased towards the outermost 10 - 15 mm of intracranial space. These general results, along with the detailed quantitation of sensitivity estimates around the head, can provide detailed guidance for interpreting the likely sources of NIRS signals, as well as help NIRS investigators design and plan better NIRS experiments, head probes and instruments...|$|E
40|$|A {{small number}} of west African Bos taurus cattle breeds, {{including}} the N'Dama, constitute a valuable genetic resource {{by virtue of their}} ability to remain productive under trypanosomiasis challenge. However, introgression of Bos indicus genes into the trypanotolerant breeds, particularly by introduction of zebu bulls, is a threat to this resource. This work describes the characterization and cloning of a bovine randomly amplified polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the 10 base primer ILO 1065 from Bos indicus <b>male</b> <b>templates,</b> but not from B. taurus <b>male</b> <b>templates</b> of female templates of either type. Male-specific sequences with homology to the RAPD also occur in B. taurus breeds. This suggests that the polymorphism may be due to base substitution(s) in an ILO 1065 priming site, or insertion/deletion events either affecting priming sites or occurring between sites on the cattle Y chromosome. We have shown that cattle, whether of B. indicus or B. taurus phenotype, which possess a typically B. indicus metaphase Y chromosome on the basis of QFQ banding, have a B. indicus ILO 1065 -generated genotype. The ILO 1065 -primed RAPd {{can be used in a}} simple dot blot assay as a probe of RAPD-PCR products, to provide a convenient, reliable and effective means of detecting introgression of zebu genes in B. taurus cattle populations...|$|R
40|$|The focuses of {{this paper}} are {{narrative}} structures and mythological elements in the video game Chrono Trigger. A qualitative method was used to code the game world's seven eras into themes of symbolism, quest-themes, and, characters. These themes were compared with Northrop Frye's archetypal myth theory from Anatomy of Criticism. The results show that each age relates to a season and moves due to the player's influence according to a cyclical pattern. Six out of seven epochs show high correlation to Frye's archetypal model whereas options such as to discard the main hero illustrates the player's control. The seventh era pictures a more female symbolism than the <b>male</b> dominant <b>template</b> proposed by Frye. A hypothesis is presented {{with the concept of}} a fluent surface which argues that the player manipulates the basic story to build a personal narrative. Furthermore, the hypothesis emphasizes that the specific game mechanics stimulates the player's sensitivity to the narrative elements when constructing an individual ideal story...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the archaeological evidence for female monasticism in medieval Ireland, {{with a particular}} emphasis on the later medieval period. Female monasticism has been considered from an archaeological perspective in several countries, most notably Britain, but {{has yet to be}} considered in any detail in Ireland. The study aims to bring together all the currently available evidence on female monasticism and consider it through an engendered archaeological approach. The data gathering for this research has been deliberately wide, and where gaps have been identified in the Irish evidence, comparative material from elsewhere has been considered. Nunneries should not be expected to conform to what has become the <b>male</b> monastic <b>template</b> of a claustrally-planned monastery. The research conducted shows a distinct and varied archaeology and architecture for medieval nunneries in Ireland which suggests that a claustral plan was not considered an essential part of a nunnery scheme. Nunneries provided an enclosed environment where women, for a variety of motives could become brides of Christ. Through the performance and celebration of the daily Divine Office, the Mass and seasonal liturgy, spaces used by the nunnery community were negotiated and transformed into a sacred Paradise on earth. However, rather than being isolated in the landscape nunneries in later medieval Ireland were located either within or close to walled towns, larger unenclosed settlements and settlement clusters and would have been well known throughout their hinterlands. This research concludes that nunneries were an intrinsic part of the medieval monastic landscape in Ireland and an essential component of patrons’ portfolios of patronage, at a particularly local level, and where they interacted closely with their local community...|$|R
40|$|The {{template}} brain (FCWB) {{was constructed}} by screening for whole brains within the FlyCircuit dataset, and manually selecting {{a pool of}} brains that appeared of good quality when the stacks were inspected. Separate average female and average <b>male</b> <b>template</b> brains were constructed from 17 and 9 brains, respectively using the CMTK ([URL] avg_adm function which takes a single brain as a seed. After five iterations the resultant average male and average female brains were placed in an affine symmetric position within their image stacks so that a simple horizontal (x -axis) flip of either template brain resulted in an almost perfect overlap of left and right hemispheres. Finally the two sex-specific template brains were then averaged (with equal weight) to make an intersex template brain using the same procedure. Since {{the purpose of this}} template was to provide an optimal registration target for the flycircuit. tw dataset, no attempt was made to correct for the obvious disparity between the XY and Z voxel dimensions common to all the images in the dataset. The scripts used for the construction of the template are available at [URL] Images from FlyCircuit were obtained from the NCHC (National Center for High-performance Computing) and NTHU (National Tsing Hua University), Hsinchu, Taiwan.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} Gender Classification from 3 D facial images. While most of previous work in the literature focuses on either 2 D facial images, here, we study the use of 3 D facial shape for automatic gender classification. After a preprocessing step to extract the facial masks from triangular meshes obtained using laser range scanners, we approximate the facial surfaces by collections of radial and iso-level curves. Once the curves are extracted, we aim at studying their shape using existant shape analysis framework which allows to compute similarities between a candidate face and <b>Male</b> and Female <b>templates.</b> We expect that the shape of certain curves are similar within Male/Female classes and different when moving from one class to another. For classification, we perfom three Machine Learning algorithms (Adaboost, Neural Network, and SVM). Overall, Adaboost was superior in classification performance (84. 98 %as classification rate) on a subset of FRGCv 2 dataset including the first (neutral and non-neutral) scans of different subjects. Our results indicate also that (i) the most relevant iso-level curves cover the central stripe of the face, and (ii) the most relevant radial curves are located on {{the upper part of}} the face...|$|R
40|$|In {{diverse and}} {{productive}} habitats, predaceous arthropods {{are expected to}} frequently encounter dangerous conspecifics and heterospecifics. This should make quick and accurate discriminations between species and sexes adaptive. By simultaneously sampling both visual cues and pheromones, and by utilizing stringent species- and sex-specific visual recognition templates, an individual {{should be able to}} increase both its speed and accuracy in making such discriminations. We tested for the use and stringency of visual recognition templates in the jumping spider Lyssomanes viridis by presenting males with animated images of conspecifics, heterospecifics and composite images that combined the facial coloration and morphology of one sex or species with the leg coloration of another. Males' courtship versus threat displays indicated whether a stimulus was perceived as a potential mate or a threat. By comparing males' visual inspection times of, and display types towards, the various images in the presence versus absence of female pheromones, we were able to deduce whether males tend to inspect a subset of the color pattern and morphological features that make up their conspecific recognition templates (i. e. those on just the face or just the legs), or all features, and whether this changes in the presence of pheromones. We found that the <b>male</b> recognition <b>template</b> for conspecific female was surprisingly coarse, whereas the recognition <b>template</b> for conspecific <b>male,</b> and especially the male face, was more specific. Pheromones hastened the recognition of images with coloration and morphology closely matching those of conspecifics, presumably by activating conspecific visual recognition <b>templates.</b> When <b>males</b> were presented with an image that was, overall, a poor match to a conspecific female, but that contained a subset of female or female-like features, female pheromones usually did not hasten recognition, but did increase the likelihood that the image would be identified as a female. Taken together, our data suggest that males examined features on both the face and the legs in both the presence and absence of pheromones, and that female pheromones tipped the balance in favor of a female identification when a male was unsure how to categorize an incongruous set of visual features...|$|R
40|$|High-resolution {{anatomical}} {{image data}} in preclinical brain PET and SPECT studies {{is often not}} available, and inter-modality spatial normalization to an MRI brain template is frequently performed. However, this procedure can be challenging for tracers where substantial anatomical structures present limited tracer uptake. Therefore, we constructed and validated strain- and tracer-specific rat brain templates in Paxinos space to allow intra-modal registration. PET [18 F]FDG, [11 C]flumazenil, [11 C]MeDAS, [11 C]PK 11195 and [11 C]raclopride, and SPECT [99 mTc]HMPAO brain scans were acquired from healthy <b>male</b> rats. Tracer-specific <b>templates</b> were constructed by averaging the scans, and by spatial normalization to a widely used MRI-based template. The added value of tracer-specific templates was evaluated by quantification of the residual error between original and realigned voxels after random misalignments of the data set. Additionally, the impact of strain differences, disease uptake patterns (focal and diffuse lesion), {{and the effect of}} image and template size on the registration errors were explored. Mean registration errors were 0. 70 ± 0. 32 mm for [18 F]FDG (n = 25), 0. 23 ± 0. 10 mm for [11 C]flumazenil (n = 13), 0. 88 ± 0. 20 mm for [11 C]MeDAS (n = 15), 0. 64 ± 0. 28 mm for [11 C]PK 11195 (n = 19), 0. 34 ± 0. 15 mm for [11 C]raclopride (n = 6), and 0. 40 ± 0. 13 mm for [99 mTc]HMPAO (n = 15). These values were smallest with tracer-specific templates, when compared to the use of [18 F]FDG as reference template (p& 0. 001). Additionally, registration errors were smallest with strain-specific templates (p& 0. 05), and when images and templates had the same size (p≤ 0. 001). Moreover, highest registration errors were found for the focal lesion group (p& 0. 005) and the diffuse lesion group (p = n. s.). In the voxel-based analysis, the reported coordinates of the focal lesion model are consistent with the stereotaxic injection procedure. The use of PET/SPECT strain- and tracer-specific templates allows accurate registration of functional rat brain data, independent of disease specific uptake patterns and with registration error below spatial resolution of the cameras. The templates and the SAMIT package will be freely available for the research community. status: publishe...|$|R
