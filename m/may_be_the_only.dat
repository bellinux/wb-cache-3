5|$|An {{extraterrestrial}} civilization {{may choose}} to communicate with humanity by means of artifacts or probes rather than by radio, for various reasons. While probes may {{take a long time}} to reach the Solar System, once there they would be able to hold a sustained dialogue that would be impossible using radio from hundreds or thousands of light-years away. Radio would be completely unsuitable for surveillance and continued monitoring of a civilization, and should an extraterrestrial civilization wish to perform these activities on humanity, artifacts <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> option other than to send large, crewed spacecraft to the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Many {{animals can}} learn {{behaviours}} by imitation, but ants <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> group apart from mammals where interactive teaching has been observed. A knowledgeable forager of Temnothorax albipennis {{will lead a}} naive nest-mate to newly discovered food {{by the process of}} tandem running. The follower obtains knowledge through its leading tutor. The leader is acutely sensitive to the progress of the follower and slows down when the follower lags and speeds up when the follower gets too close.|$|E

At the time, it dealt exclusively in pianos, and became the largest such dealership in its region. Brook <b>Mays</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> major music company {{in the area to}} survive the Great Depression.|$|R
2500|$|Mays {{retired after}} the 1973 {{season with a}} {{lifetime}} batting average of [...]302 and 660 home runs. His lifetime total of 7,095 outfield putouts remains the major league record. <b>Mays</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> major league player to have {{hit a home run}} in every inning from the 1st through the 16th innings.

5|$|Sacred groves {{exist in}} China, India, Africa and elsewhere. They {{are places where}} the deities live and where all the living things are either sacred or are companions of the gods. Folklore lays down the supernatural {{penalties}} that will result if desecration takes place for example by the felling of trees. Because of their protected status, sacred groves <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> relicts of ancient forest and have a biodiversity {{much greater than the}} surrounding area.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of Acrocanthosaurus in the Cloverly Formation {{was established in}} 2012 with the description of another partial skeleton, UM20796. This specimen, consisting of parts of two vertebrae, partial pubic bones, a femur, a partial fibula, and fragments, represents a juvenile animal. It came from a bonebed in the Bighorn Basin of north-central Wyoming, and was found near the shoulder blade of a Sauroposeidon. An assortment of other fragmentary theropod remains from the formation may also belong to Acrocanthosaurus, which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> large theropod in the Cloverly Formation.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} the Ferugliotheriidae is overall more limited, both in extent and time, than that of Sudamericidae; sudamericids have been {{recorded}} from the Late Cretaceous to Miocene of Argentina, the Late Cretaceous of Madagascar and India, the Middle Eocene of Antarctica, and perhaps the Cretaceous of Tanzania (TNM 02067, tentatively referred to Sudamericidae). Nevertheless, ferugliotheriids <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> gondwanatheres {{to have had a}} presence in the northern hemisphere.|$|E

5|$|Wood has {{traditionally}} been used for fuel, especially in rural areas. In less developed nations it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> fuel available and collecting firewood is often a time consuming task as it becomes necessary to travel further and further afield {{in the search for}} fuel. It is often burned inefficiently on an open fire. In more developed countries other fuels are available and burning wood is a choice rather than a necessity. Modern wood-burning stoves are very fuel efficient and new products such as wood pellets are available to burn.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of most frogs {{are located}} {{on either side of}} the head near the top and project {{outwards}} as hemispherical bulges. They provide binocular vision over a field of 100° to the front and a total visual field of almost 360°. They <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> part of an otherwise submerged frog to protrude from the water. Each eye has closable upper and lower lids and a nictitating membrane which provides further protection, especially when the frog is swimming. Members of the aquatic family Pipidae have the eyes located at the top of the head, a position better suited for detecting prey in the water above. The irises come in a range of colours and the pupils in a range of shapes. The common toad (Bufo bufo) has golden irises and horizontal slit-like pupils, the red-eyed tree frog (Agalychnis callidryas) has vertical slit pupils, the poison dart frog has dark irises, the fire-bellied toad (Bombina spp.) has triangular pupils and the tomato frog (Dyscophus spp.) has circular ones. The irises of the southern toad (Anaxyrus terrestris) are patterned so as to blend in with the surrounding camouflaged skin.|$|E

30|$|To try to {{overcome}} this objection, {{it is important to}} set objectives and face tradeoffs. One presumed objective of development <b>is</b> to help <b>the</b> poor. How to help <b>the</b> poor <b>is</b> open to discussion. Let us assume that helping the poor through improving their employment opportunities is an agreed-upon goal. Let us be clear, though, that helping <b>the</b> poor <b>may</b> not <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> goal of development policy; helping others {{in other parts of the}} income distribution or members of target groups <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> an important development goal. And let us also be clear that improving employment opportunities for <b>the</b> poor <b>may</b> not <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> means of helping them; helping the poor through improving and spreading social programs <b>may</b> <b>be</b> another means, for example.|$|R

Several other paintings, such as Veneto's fanciful portrait, have also been said to depict her, but none have been accepted by scholars at present.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his first}} season, Cepeda batted [...]312 with 25 {{home runs and}} 96 RBI, led the National League in doubles (38), and was named Rookie of the Year.

Mays had one of his best games on April 30, 1961, hitting four home runs and driving in eight runs against the Milwaukee Braves in County Stadium. Mays went four for five at <b>the</b> plate and <b>was</b> on deck for a chance to hit a record fifth home run when the Giants' half of the ninth inning ended. <b>Mays</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> Major Leaguer to have both three triples in a game and four home runs in a game.|$|R
