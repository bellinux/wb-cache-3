25|$|On December 17, 2010, {{head coach}} <b>Mike</b> <b>Shanahan</b> relegated McNabb {{to the third}} quarterback {{position}} {{for the rest of}} this season, stating that he wanted to evaluate backup Rex Grossman in game play.|$|E
25|$|Much of the pregame hype was {{centered}} around John Elway confronting his former coach Reeves. Denver head coach <b>Mike</b> <b>Shanahan</b> was hurt and angered by Reeves' pregame assertion that Shanahan and Elway had conspired {{to have him}} fired during his stint at Denver. Media coverage also focused {{on whether or not}} Elway would retire after the season (which he eventually did).|$|E
25|$|The McNabb era came to {{an abrupt}} end when he was traded to Minnesota in August 2011. The {{troublesome}} Albert Haynesworth also headed to New England. After cutting the injury-rattled Clinton Portis, the Redskins had no important offensive players left except for Santana Moss. <b>Mike</b> <b>Shanahan</b> surprised most observers by his decision to name John Beck, an obscure free agent QB, as the starter.|$|E
25|$|Marshall {{sustained}} injuries {{before the}} start of the 2007 season. He suffered a groin strain that kept him out of Broncos quarterback camp and team camp during May and June. He also pulled a quadriceps femoris muscle on July 10, 2007, during Broncos mini-camp. The injury left him out for nearly all of training camp until Broncos head coach <b>Mike</b> <b>Shanahan</b> ordered him to participate for the last couple of days.|$|E
25|$|Following the Broncos' victory during Super Bowl XXXII the {{previous}} season, many wondered if 15-year veteran quarterback John Elway would retire after finally winning a Super Bowl. But Elway {{decided to stay}} with Denver {{and see if he}} could lead them to a second consecutive championship. Under the leadership of head coach <b>Mike</b> <b>Shanahan,</b> the Broncos stormed {{to the top of the}} AFC with a 14–2 regular record in 1998, winning their first 13 games before suffering their first loss to the New York Giants.|$|E
25|$|The 49ers' {{spectacular}} performance led {{to their}} offensive coordinator, <b>Mike</b> <b>Shanahan,</b> and defensive coordinator, Ray Rhodes, earning head coaching positions in 1995 for the Denver Broncos and the Philadelphia Eagles, respectively. Bobby Ross became the second coach, after Jimmy Johnson in Super Bowl XXVII, to lead a team to a college football national championship (Georgia Tech in 1990) and a Super Bowl. One year later, Barry Switzer would join Johnson as the only coaches to win championships in both NCAA Division I-A (now FBS) college football and the NFL.|$|E
25|$|Redskins {{head coach}} <b>Mike</b> <b>Shanahan</b> made a {{decision}} to bench the team's franchise quarterback, Robert Griffin III for the team's final three games of the 2013 season. Griffin had undergone knee surgery after being injured the previous season in which he was named NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year after being selected second overall in the 2012 draft. Griffin was much less productive in his second season. Shanahan stated that the decision to start Kirk Cousins over Griffin was made to protect Griffin from sustaining another injury, although there was speculation that Shanahan was unhappy about Griffin's friendly relationship with team owner Daniel Snyder. Shanahan was fired after the season ended.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} week of the 2010 season, McNabb and head coach <b>Mike</b> <b>Shanahan</b> led the Redskins to victory over the Dallas Cowboys. In week 2, McNabb nearly {{engineered}} a victory over the Houston Texans, passing for 426 yards (third most of his career), but came up just short of a victory when the Texans prevailed 30-27 in overtime. In week 4, on October 3, McNabb played against the Eagles for the first time, returning with the Redskins to Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia. Although McNabb posted only pedestrian statistics, the Redskins won 17-12. During pre-game introductions, McNabb received a standing ovation from Eagles fans, then hugged former coach Andy Reid at their post-game handshake.|$|E
25|$|The Redskins' {{fortunes}} {{continued to}} slide in 2009, as they lost {{two of the}} first four matches, {{one of which was}} a 19-14 defeat {{at the hands of the}} Lions, a team that had not won a game since December 2007. After that, they lost to Carolina on the road and Kansas City at home, the latter match handing another victory to a winless team. On Monday Night Football, the Redskins lost to Philadelphia in a game where Jim Zorn was temporarily relieved of his duties by offensive coordinator Sherman Lewis. In Week 10, they inflicted a surprise defeat on the Denver Broncos before losing two divisional matches to Dallas and Philadelphia. The Week 13 game against an undefeated Saints team proved another surprise. The Redskins managed to tie at the end of regulation, and in overtime had a chance to break New Orleans' winning streak. However, kicker Shaun Suisham missed a field goal that would have given them the victory. On their next possession, the Saints scored a FG and won the game 33-30. Suisham was cut after the game and signed with Dallas (his original team). The Redskins then routed Oakland in Week 14 before losing their last three games to finish 4-12. The second match with the Cowboys ended in a 16-0 shutout, making for only the second season since 1970 where Washington lost all of its divisional matches. Jim Zorn was fired and replaced by <b>Mike</b> <b>Shanahan</b> afterwards.|$|E
500|$|In addition, {{former players}} have become {{assistant}} coaches, such as Earnest Byner, Russ Grimm, and Keenan McCardell. [...] On January 5, 2010 the Redskins hired former Denver Broncos and Oakland Raiders coach <b>Mike</b> <b>Shanahan.</b> Shanahan went 24–40 during four seasons in charge, {{before he was}} fired on December 30, 2013.|$|E
500|$|In {{the hours}} before the AFC Championship Game, the Denver Broncos were {{watching}} the NFC Championship Game on the JumboTron at Mile High Stadium to see who they would play in Super Bowl XXXIII should they defeat the New York Jets. Broncos head coach <b>Mike</b> <b>Shanahan</b> expressed surprise at Anderson's missed kick, and running back Terrell Davis said that the Falcons' subsequent victory put the Broncos in the mindset that they had [...] "won the Super Bowl already," [...] as their greatest potential challenge had been eliminated. This distraction nearly cost the Broncos the game against the Jets, as the Broncos played a very poor game.|$|E
500|$|Grossman {{signed a}} one-year {{contract}} with the Washington Redskins for the 2010 season on March 17, 2010. Grossman made his first appearance for the Redskins against the Detroit Lions on October 31, 2010, but he was sacked and lost a fumble on his first play, which was returned by Lions defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh for a touchdown. On December 17, Redskins coach <b>Mike</b> <b>Shanahan</b> benched Donovan McNabb in favor of Grossman, {{who had not been}} a starter since 2008. The Redskins fell behind the Dallas Cowboys early in the game, but Grossman threw for 322 yards, four touchdowns, and two interceptions to erase a 20-point deficit. The Cowboys still managed to win the game, 33–30. [...] Grossman won his second start with Washington in a close and important game for the Jaguars in Jacksonville.|$|E
500|$|There {{have been}} 15 head coaches for the Broncos franchise.

Shanahan and Dan Reeves, are tied for the most playoffs games coached (13).

[...] Jack Faulkner, John Ralston, Red Miller, and Reeves have been named the United Press International (UPI) NFL Coach of the Year, at least once with the Broncos. Filchock, Faulkner, Mac Speedie, Jerry Smith, Ralston, and Miller spent their entire coaching careers with the Broncos. Speedie, Ray Malavasi, Miller, Shanahan, and Kubiak have been assistant coaches with the Broncos before they became head coaches with the Broncos.|$|E
2500|$|Florida {{athletic}} director Jeremy Foley initiated a coaching search {{which focused on}} Denver Broncos head coach <b>Mike</b> <b>Shanahan</b> and Oklahoma Sooners head coach Bob Stoops. [...] After both turned him down, Foley decided on New Orleans Saints defensive coordinator and former Gator assistant Ron Zook as Spurrier's replacement.|$|E
2500|$|On November 27, {{head coach}} <b>Mike</b> <b>Shanahan</b> officially {{announced}} that Cutler would replace Jake Plummer as starting quarterback despite a 7-4 record because, [...] "I think {{he gives us}} {{the best chance to}} win now."

2500|$|One of Atwater's career {{highlights}} {{happened on}} September 17, 1990, during a Monday Night Football telecast from Mile High Stadium in Denver, Colorado. As Kansas City Chiefs massive 260 lbs. running back Christian Okoye, came {{through a hole}} in the line of scrimmage, he was met by Atwater. The resulting collision stopped Okoye in his tracks, with Atwater standing over him, taunting the proclaimed [...] "Nigerian Nightmare", while he lay on the ground stunned. His coach <b>Mike</b> <b>Shanahan</b> stated [...] "That's the hit people will remember him for." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1979 {{season was}} a 0–10–1 disaster, but Pell's Gators {{improved}} after he hired offensive coach <b>Mike</b> <b>Shanahan.</b> Quarterbacks Bob Hewko and Wayne Peace {{led the team}} to an NCAA-record turnaround with an 8–3 season in 1980. Despite Georgia's consensus All-American back Herschel Walker, Florida nearly defeated the national-champion Bulldogs for {{what would have been}} its first SEC championship until Georgia executed {{one of the most famous}} plays in college-football history. The Bulldogs were trailing 21–20 with time running out, facing a third down and long yardage from their seven-yard line. After scrambling around his end zone, Georgia quarterback Buck Belue found wide receiver Lindsay Scott open in the middle of the field. Scott outran everyone else down the sideline, scoring the game-winning touchdown with seconds left. Georgia radio announcer Larry Munson's call of the play gave the game its nickname: [...] "Run Lindsay Run." ...|$|E
2500|$|Romo {{attended}} the 2003 NFL Combine. Despite intriguing some scouts, he went undrafted by any NFL team during the 2003 NFL Draft. Throughout the draft, Romo was assured by Sean Payton of the Cowboys' interest (Romo was also intensely pursued by former Denver Broncos head coach <b>Mike</b> <b>Shanahan),</b> and shortly afterwards was signed as an undrafted rookie free agent by the Cowboys. [...] Romo entered the 2003 training camp {{third on the}} Cowboys' depth chart behind Quincy Carter and Chad Hutchinson. In 2004, the Cowboys released Hutchinson and signed veteran quarterback Vinny Testaverde and traded a third round draft pick to the Houston Texans for quarterback Drew Henson. Romo faced being cut from the roster until Carter was released following allegations of substance abuse. Throughout 2004 and 2005, Romo served as the holder for placekicks. [...] After Vinny Testaverde's tenure in Dallas ended in 2005, the Cowboys signed veteran quarterback Drew Bledsoe, the team's eighth starting quarterback since 2000.|$|E
