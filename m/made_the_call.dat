5|$|On 10 September 2007, Licciardello rang a {{talkback}} {{radio station}} {{pretending to be}} someone else, and complained about the stunt, claiming that it was stupid and anyone involved at the ABC, including Kerry O'Brien, should be jailed for ten years. This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode, and Licciardello said {{he wished he had}} <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> on the evening of the security breach because talkback radio discussion would not have already died down.|$|E

He ties and gags Scully, and keeps her in a dark closet.|$|E
5|$|Becky tells Steve {{that she}} is {{pregnant}} and he later discovers that Becky has already told Claire and Steve tells his mother, Liz. Unfortunately Becky miscarries twice, although she was unaware of her 2nd pregnancy, and medical tests reveal an abnormality of the womb, meaning she is unable to carry a child full-term, making Becky decide {{that she wants to}} adopt. During the process, Steve needs a reference from Amy's mother, Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), who promptly uses it to cause trouble, making Becky threaten, in return, that Tracy will never see Amy again. Unfortunately Becky and Steve are refused the right to adopt because her estranged half-sister Kylie gave a bad reference and the fact that Social Services feel that it is too soon after her miscarriages. She confronts Kylie, but the sisters eventually reconcile and Becky helps Kylie reclaim custody of her son, Max. Becky becomes very attached to Max, whilst Kylie becomes more irresponsible. Kylie announces plans to move to Cyprus with her new boyfriend and Becky begs her to reconsider, so Kylie offers to sell Max to her and Steve for £20,000, which they agree to. On the night of the tram crash, Kylie returns and demands more money, so Becky steals £5,000 from the ruins of Dev Alahan's (Jimmi Harkishin) corner shop, to pay Kylie off. Tracy is released from prison and the two start feuding again, particularly after Tracy discovers Max's sale and agrees to keep quiet in exchange for Amy.

50|$|It was {{not long}} before some of the {{weaknesses}} in the 1799 Constitution were exposed. As early as 1828, some in the General Assembly began calling for a new constitutional convention. However, because <b>the</b> 1799 Constitution <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>calling</b> of a convention such an arduous task, it took more than twenty years to <b>call</b> <b>the</b> convention, which finally convened in Frankfort on October 1, 1849.|$|R
25|$|Dorgan's {{statement}} {{pointed out}} other {{errors in the}} news reports, such as correcting who made {{a call to the}} Department of the Interior and for what purpose. The news reports claimed that one of Dorgan's staff members <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> in order to express support for the program that benefited Abramoff's clients, whereas in reality it was a staff member for the Chairman of the Interior Subcommittee who <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>call,</b> and the call was made in opposition to the program.|$|E

They were sent to an RTD bus depot at 54th and Arlington and told to await further instructions. The command post formed at this location was activated at approximately 6:00 pm, but once set up had no cellular phones or computers other than those in squad cars. It had insufficient numbers of telephone lines and handheld police radios to assess {{and respond to the}} situation. Finally, the site had no televisions, which meant that as live broadcasts of unrest began, command post officers did not see any of the coverage for themselves.|$|E
25|$|Team New Zealand won race ten by 16 seconds, in {{what was}} widely {{reported}} {{as one of the}} most exciting America's Cup races of all time. Barker looked to have been left behind by Spithill at the startline, but just managed to hold an overlap as the AC72's entered the three boat length circle at the reach mark. Team New Zealand took the 3 second lead, and increased it to 11 at the second mark. Oracle again showed their new competitiveness during the upwind beat, and the lead changed three times. As the boats approached the top mark on split tacks, Barker cleverly slowed the boat, and then aimed down to pass under Oracle at speed. The top mark split was only 1 second as Oracle rounded in front of the shore, and Aotearoa rounded the other mark. With the race still too close to call during the downwind leg, Spithill <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> to dip behind Team New Zealand rather than jibe. The gap almost instantly became 100 metres. Barker was able to hold this lead to the finish to take the series to 1–7.|$|E
50|$|In January 1990 it was {{reported}} that Stangeland had made several hundred long-distance phone calls from 1986 to 1987 on his House credit card to and from the residences of a female lobbyist from Virginia.

500|$|In December 2011, then Prime Minister John Key {{revealed}} that he had asked McCaw {{about the possibility of}} a knighthood in the 2012 New Year Honours, but that McCaw had turned it down. According to Key, [...] "He <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> that he's still in his playing career and it didn't feel quite right for him, that day where he's no longer on the pitch may be the right time for him." [...] No formal offer was ultimately made. McCaw was appointed a member of New Zealand's highest honour, the Order of New Zealand, in the 2016 New Year Honours. The honour surpassed the knighthood he had previously turned down prior to his retirement because only 20 living New Zealanders can gain membership at any one time.|$|E
500|$|Designer Harvey Smith {{suggested}} a streamlined plot that removed the Mexican invasion to make development easier and the narrative more personal. While finished assets were repurposed, entire {{parts of the}} game were abandoned, including Texas and the Denver airport. Environments such as a flooded city became a Majestic 12 research site and the endgame Helios space station became Area 51. He also <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> to remove a playable mid-game White House level due to its complexity and production needs in other areas. Pete Davison of USgamer referred to the White House and presidential bunker as [...] "the truly deleted scenes of Deus Ex lost levels". Spector referred to his [...] "dream" [...] level—the White House—as their [...] "toughest map challenge". The team has speculated that the assets may exist on a [...] "DVDs in someone's attic", though Pacotti, Smith, Spector, and the final release have no trace of them. Pacotti felt {{that the experience of}} rescuing Paul was worth cutting the White House from the game.|$|E
500|$|One of Bart's early {{hallmarks}} {{were his}} prank calls to Moe's Tavern owner Moe Szyslak in which Bart calls Moe {{and asks for}} a gag name. Moe tries to find that person in the bar, but rapidly realizes it is a prank call and (despite not knowing who actually <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>call)</b> angrily threatens Bart. These calls {{were based on a}} series of prank calls known as the Tube Bar recordings. Moe was based partly on Tube Bar owner Louis [...] "Red" [...] Deutsch, whose often profane responses inspired Moe's violent side. The prank calls debuted in [...] "Homer's Odyssey", (season one, 1990) the third episode to air, but were included in [...] "Some Enchanted Evening", the first episode of the series that was produced. As the series progressed, it became more difficult for the writers {{to come up with a}} fake name and to write Moe's angry response, so the pranks were dropped as a regular joke during the fourth season [...] but they have occasionally resurfaced on the show.|$|E

500|$|Known for his charisma, personality, and iconic stature on the court, Rudolph symbolized NBA officiating {{during the}} early years of the NBA to fans of {{professional}} basketball and became the most recognizable official during the NBA's first four decades. [...] Bob Ryan of The Boston Globe said of Rudolph, [...] "If any man other than Red Auerbach ever earned the title of NBA institution, it was certainly Mendy Rudolph." [...] Upon retirement, he set a precedent for the standards that future referees are judged. [...] Early in his officiating career, Joe Crawford (later hired by the NBA in 1977) attended games that Rudolph worked in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and studied his style and approach. [...] Earl Strom credited Rudolph for being an influence on the development of his career in the NBA. [...] In his autobiography, Calling the Shots, Strom described Rudolph as [...] "one of the most prominent referees because of his style, courage, and judgment. [...] He had excellent judgment.

500|$|Khan collaborated for {{the third}} time with Aditya Chopra on the romantic drama Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008) {{opposite}} Anushka Sharma, at that time a newcomer. He played Surinder Sahni, a shy man with low self-esteem, whose love for his young arranged wife (Sharma) causes him to transform himself into Raj, a boisterous alter-ego. Rachel Saltz of The New York Times believed the dual role to have been [...] "tailor-made" [...] for Khan, giving him the opportunity to display his talents, although Deep Contractor from Epilogue thought Khan displayed greater strength in the role of Surinder and weakness in the role of monologue-prone Raj. In December 2008, Khan suffered a shoulder injury while filming a small role in Mudassar Aziz's Dulha Mil Gaya. He underwent extensive physiotherapy sessions at the time but the pain left him almost immobile and he had arthroscopic surgery in February 2009. He performed an extended, special appearance in the 2009 film Billu, playing Bollywood superstar Sahir Khana fictionalised version of himself, wherein he performed musical item numbers with actresses Kareena Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra, and Deepika Padukone. As head of the film's production company, Red Chillies, Khan <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> to change the title of the film from Billu Barber to Billu after hairdressers across the country complained that the word [...] "barber" [...] was derogatory.

2500|$|Tennessee {{was one of}} {{the most}} divided states in the country at the outset of the war. Before the {{bombardment}} of Fort Sumter, Tennessee was actually staunchly pro-Union, though there were still a few secessionist hot beds in the western portion of the state. The situation changed when Fort Sumter was bombarded and Lincoln <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> for 75,000 volunteers to suppress the rebellion. Tennesseans saw this as a threat to their [...] "southern brethren," [...] and the only real pockets of pro-Unionism came from the eastern portion of the state. In fact, Tennessee would furnish more troops for the Union than any other Confederate state, combined. However, over three times that number volunteered for the Confederacy. Interestingly, notable general Nathan Bedford Forrest voted against secession, but later fought for his state when it seceded.|$|E
2500|$|Then the Wobblies {{through their}} {{newspaper}} the Industrial Worker <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> for a citywide strike on May 1, 1923 (the historic May Day of international socialism).

On the same day, IWW leaders persuaded approximately 450 of 2,200 men to strike at refinery construction jobs two miles north of the harbor, and it seemed likely that the dispute would spread beyond the water front. Employers therefore decided to take immediate action both to prevent this and to move ships more rapidly. [...] Negotiations with the longshoremen, however, foundered on their demand for their own hiring hall and the abandonment of the Sea Service Bureau, or [...] "Fink Hall," [...] controlled by the stevedoring and shipping firms.

This was the first aerial kill of a manned aircraft by an American fighter since 1999, the first kill by a Super Hornet, and the third kill by F/A-18 aircraft. The shoot-down was executed by Lt. Cmdr. Michael [...] "MOB" [...] Tremel, a pilot assigned to Strike Fighter Squadron 87 aboard the carrier George H.W. Bush. An E-3 Sentry issued several warnings to the Su-22, and after it dropped bombs near SDF fighters Tremel independently <b>made</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> to shoot down the aircraft based on established rules of engagement.
