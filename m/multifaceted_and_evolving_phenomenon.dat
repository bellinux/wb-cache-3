While earlier research has looked at various elements and arrangements of international volunteering, this is the first study that specifically looks at young, foreign volunteers serving in Chinese schools. Profiling five volunteers from the United States and Europe, this paper aimed to understand the connections that are made between foreign volunteers and Chinese hosts and how these connections impact cross-cultural learning and social justice. Volunteer respondents indicated that their volunteering experience has modified their views on China and education, has taught them about the complex volunteer-recipient relationship, and will impact their future career or volunteer contributions. Analyzing the motivations, experiences, and reflections of these volunteers provides a model for international volunteering as a means toward social justice.

30|$|Many {{studies on}} the {{transformation}} of township enterprises focus on the softening of contract constraints. For instance, Liu (1999) explicates how contract constraint relations have softened and how business agents have acquired residual control of property rights {{from the perspective of}} re-embedding between the business agent and his/her interpersonal network. For township enterprises, the situation is more complicated. Zhou (2005) analyzes the ambiguous <b>and</b> <b>evolving</b> <b>phenomenon</b> in township enterprises from the view of the relation of property rights, claiming that it is mainly attributed to township enterprises adapting to a complex environment in order to attain resources. Liu (2003) explains the complexity through three dimensions of possession. The softening of property rights constraints proves from another aspect that constraint relations could be softened by resorting to a certain mechanism of the community. This mechanism functioned because economic relations have been embedded into social relations (Polanyi 2013; Granovetter 2008). Therefore for transaction relationships between acquaintances, the trust mechanism is not generally established on the basis of strict contract relations.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{investigate}} images of Polovtsians (Cumans) in the chronicles in terms of their direct perceptions by Russians—as enemies and neighbors, allies and relatives. Narratives and messages in the early chronicle tradition enable us to trace the formation of such images and the dynamics of their transformation. The study was conducted on the basis of reports and narratives in the Laurentian and Hypatian Chronicles that transmit events of the pre-Mongol period. The chroniclers describe the Polovtsians in terms of ethnic, religious, and, sometimes, geopolitical features. In some cases, they appear as a single entity and in others, as individuals. The latter includes contexts in which the Cuman act as allies of the Russian princes. Analysis of the chronicle material shows that the image of the Polovtsian is a complex <b>and</b> <b>evolving</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> As a general trend, it can be noted that there is a transformation from general references, which are not personalized, to images of Polovtsians either as individuals or as engaging in some kind of community-driven actions with understandable motives and goals.

Revealing, analyzing and exploiting non-evident (often hidden) communities formulated in Web social networks is crucial, since communities influence content distribution and drive Web trends and events. It is now important to overcome typical single- criterion community detection methodologies (usually originating from graph mining), and within multidisciplinary efforts advance novel multiple criteria approaches which will identify communities of high coherence and homogeneity. In constructing such Web community indices (both {{now and in the}} future Web context) it is vital to consider human behavioral and cognitive criteria, since, it is those that affect users’ activities, preferences and social interactions on the Web. We therefore argue, that within typical processing criteria (such as frequency of access, user profiling, and content semantics), we need to incorporate affective criteria which are closely connected to users’ actions and social interactions. In this paper we present an emotion aware clustering approach that incorporates affect as a central component.

40|$|The {{demographic}} phenomenon of “low fertility” has received considerable attention {{over the last}} three decades within academic, political, and public spheres. While a large body of research has led to {{a deeper understanding of the}} underlying social and economic dimensions of low fertility, current theoretical and empirical approaches fail to explain puzzles pertaining to within and across population heterogeneity in fertility rates. This dissertation is comprised of three papers that investigate the social, economic, and demographic causes and consequences of low fertility. Chapter 1 sets forth a new theoretical approach to examining the interrelations between low fertility, socioeconomic development, and gender equity among developed countries. The main findings of this chapter are that 1) the pace and onset of socioeconomic development explain a significant proportion of the variation in fertility among developed countries, 2) low fertility may facilitate changes in gender norms through a “gender-equity dividend”, and 3) contrary to Second Demographic Transition theory, low fertility may be a transitory phase of the demographic transition. Whereas the Chapter 1 looks cross-nationally at gender and fertility dynamics, Chapter 2 takes a micro-level approach by exploring the relationship between fertility and gender norms in the United States. Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY 79), I find that both men and women with progressive views on gender equity have lower fertility than their traditional counterparts, though these results were stronger, more consistent, and more significant across models for women. In Chapter 3 I argue that the rising costs of childrearing through “shadow education” have become a key fertility-reducing force across high, medium, and low-income countries. To investigate this hypothesis, I use data from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and find evidence of a “quality-quantity tradeoff” both within and across populations due to costly shadow education. Collectively, the findings of this dissertation signal that the causes and consequences of low fertility are <b>multifaceted</b> <b>and</b> <b>evolving</b> across time <b>and</b> space. ...|$|R

40|$|Chinoiserie remains {{relatively}} unexplored in {{the context}} of music and is usually isolated as a mid-eighteenth-century phenomenon characterized by the use of decorative Chinese motifs and concepts in Western art, porcelain, furniture, and architecture. This thesis enriches possible readings of musical chinoiserie by exploring its relationship to the intense fashion for Chinese commodities, its correlation to particular social and political climates, and its connection to the eternal themes of the feminine and utopian pastoral. As a recurring <b>and</b> <b>evolving</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> chinoiserie has been manifested across the past three centuries in various genres and works central to Western music. The following chapters provide case studies which draw attention to particularly rich constellations of ideas about chinoiserie, and analyse the various ways that 'the West' has confronted, represented, and appropriated Chinese difference in music. Chapter two examines the emergence of eighteenth-century European music theatre/ drama inspired by China and its interrelation with royalty and nobility, consumer goods, fashion, and aesthetic sensibility. Chapter three explores early twentieth-century French musical works by Debussy, De Falla, and Roussel, which are inspired by nostalgic and utopian Chinese landscapes. In chapter four, the music of Mahler, Puccini, and Stravinsky reveal alternative fin de siècle approaches to chinoiserie. Common themes include an increased interest in authenticity; overt and subsumed Chinese elements; and the integration of chinoiserie into existing programmes. As a counterpoint to this, chapter five turns to popular music genres which directly responded to the social and political reality of Chinese immigration to America. The straightforward, formulaic, and market driven style of Tin Pan Alley songs provides the most explicit examples of musical chinoiserie, which upon examination reveal a variety of hidden beliefs, prejudices, aspirations and idealized visions of China. By no means are these chapters intended to offer a comprehensive survey of musical chinoiserie, but they provide case studies which demonstrate the ways in which a musical work can interact with a multiplicity of intellectual and emotional responses to the West's encounter with China during important social, political, and historical events.

They have raised {{a fair amount of}} attention in the communities of social simulation, sociophysics and complexity science. The researchers working on it come from disciplines as physics, mathematics, computer science, social psychology and philosophy. Agents hold continuous opinions which they can gradually adjust if they hear the opinions of others. The idea of bounded confidence is that agents only interact if they are close in opinion to each other.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{prevalence}} of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) -producing Escherichia coli has been increased {{not only in}} the hospital but also in the community worldwide. This study was aimed to characterize ESBL- producing E. coli isolates and to investigate the molecular epidemiology of community isolates in comparison with hospital isolates at a single center in Korea. Methods A total of 142 ESBL-producing E. coli isolates were collected at Daejeon St Mary’s Hospital in Korea from January 2008 to September 2009. The ESBLs were characterized by PCR sequencing using specific primers. The genetic relatedness was determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Results Of 142 isolates, 139 were positive for CTX-M type ESBLs; CTX-M- 14 (n[*]=[*] 69, 49. 6 [*]%), CTX-M- 15 (n[*]=[*] 53, 38. 1 [*]%) and both CTX-M- 14 and - 15 (n[*]=[*] 17, 12. 2 [*]%). CTX-M- 14 and CTX-M- 15 were detected in both community and hospital isolates whereas isolates producing both CTX-M 14 and- 15 were mainly identified in the hospital. CTX-M producing E. coli isolates were genetically heterogeneous, revealing 75 distinct PFGE types. By MLST, 21 distinctive STs including 5 major STs (ST 131, ST 405, ST 38, ST 10, and ST 648) were identified. Major STs were distributed in both community and hospital isolates, and ST 131 was the predominant clone regardless of the locations of acquisition. No specific major STs were confined to a single type of ESBLs. However, ST 131 clones were significantly associated with CTX-M- 15 and the majority of them were multidrug-resistant. Distinctively, we identified a hospital epidemic caused by the dissemination of an epidemic strain, ST 131 -PFGE type 10, characterized by multidrug resistance and co-producing both CTX-Ms with OXA- 1 or TEM- 1 b. Conclusions The epidemiology of ESBL-producing E. coli is a complex <b>and</b> <b>evolving</b> <b>phenomenon</b> attributed to the horizontal transfer of genetic elements and clonal spread of major clones, predominantly ST 131. The multidrug resistant ST 131 clone producing CTX-M- 15 has emerged as a major clone in both the community and hospital, suggesting the widespread of this epidemic clone in Korea. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{information}} {{revolution is}} permanently changing {{the face of}} international relations. Wired, networked protestors help power and publicize the Arab Spring, leading to the downfall of authoritarian regimes long believed unshakable. Secret cables published by Wikileaks expose the mechanics of U. S. foreign policy decisionmaking to a global public. Chinese Internet users spread photo evidence to expose corrupt local officials. Israelis and Palestinians use video and social media to add another dimension to real-time conflict. But what do these disparate events really tell us? The popular narrative generally holds that time and distance are collapsing, everything and everyone is scrutinized, filters are nonexistent, and nonstate actors hold disproportionate and ever-increasing power. While powerful, and containing some elements of truth, this narrative is rarely re-examined in the context of policy discourse or the decisions that arise from it. There is far more to understand about international relations in what is commonly termed the information age. Changes in the speed, volume diversity, nature and accessibility of information, as well as the ways in which it is exchanged, have contributed to a variety of emerging <b>and</b> <b>evolving</b> <b>phenomena.</b> These include the rise of nontraditional security threats (cyber and otherwise), networked forms of organization, asymmetrical conflict, decentralization, recentralization, altered global governance structures, multicentrism, information asymmetry, new development models, contested global norms, and much more. All of these present challenges and opportunities for states and nonstate actors and require a substantial rethink of the lens through which we view international affairs. Yet fresh thinking on these issues, while taken up by specialized academics, rarely makes it onto the public agenda. Such research tends to get tucked away into the vibrant but often impenetrable (to outsiders) fiefdom of communications research, such that followers of international affairs do not tend to encounter it on a regular basis, if at all. Thus, the initial analysis of events hardens into an accepted truth, and it becomes increasingly difficult to pose alternate narratives or even further explore the dominant one. This working paper series intends to illuminate this narrative by delving further into the trends in international affairs that have been accelerated or otherwise augmented by the information revolution. Because this task could easily prove unmanageable, the series will examine in particular two separate but linked phenomena enhanced by the information age: heightened transparency and increased volatility...|$|R

This is largely a conceptual statement, identifying the areas of national security (homeland security) that are key to business, and exploring the management concerns of business to the new threats and opportunities that have arisen. We establish the point that homeland security is a purposeful, conscious, and rational response to terrorist events that is an emergent <b>and</b> <b>evolving</b> systems <b>phenomenon.</b> This systems approach is an especially useful way to look at the implications of homeland security in its relation to business.

Management strategies for dealing with these costs and risks are explored for U. S. firms. Our conclusion is to demonstrate the scope of analysis that is needed to understand and to managerially cope with the homeland security problem.

And finally we are able to recommend some policy dimensions for both companies and the U. S. Government toward mitigating the negative impacts of the homeland security problem. ...|$|R

40|$|Experiments {{performed}} with the aim to explain pattern formation in plasma devices offer, as I will show in this survey, a new insight into the mechanism by which locally matter transits spontaneously from a disordered state into an ordered one. The essential news revealed by these experiments is the identification of a population of electrons that, driven at a critical distance from thermal equilibrium, is able to act as the organizer of the emergence and the survival of a complexity starting from chaos, i. e., from electric sparks the appearance of which is controlled by deterministic chaos. Supplied at a constant rate with thermal energy extracted by electrons from plasma, the complexity survives in a dynamical state performing operations in agreement with a code directly related to electrons thermal energy distribution function. Acting as a constituent of the matter, the population of electrons intrinsically controls the emergence and {{the survival of the}} complexity. Performing operations directly related to electron’s thermal energy distribution function, the complexity evolves stepwise in more advanced self-organized dynamical states, when this function is changed by an additional injection of energy. A set of nonlinear phenomena, not explainable by classical processes is involved in the mechanism by which the complexity emerges, survives <b>and</b> <b>evolves.</b> Thus, <b>phenomena</b> like Bose-Einstein condensation, macroscopic quantum coherence, direct and alternate Josephson effects, electron tunneling, negative differential impedance and others, potentially explain the emergence, functionality and vitality, i. e., the dynamical state of the complexity. </p...|$|R
40|$|URL] audiencePopulation {{dynamics}} {{with age}} structure {{are very important}} in demography and ecology since the demographic parameters of most species change over their life (think of maturation and senescence) <b>and</b> many <b>phenomena</b> (<b>evolving</b> life histories or kinship based social interactions such as cooperative breeding) require the introduction of age for their proper description. We consider {{here a long time}} scale diffusion limit for the dynamics of a large purely age structured population with closely matched birth an death rates. To this end we work out the technical details necessary to apply the general results in Méléard and Tran to this particular case. This way we derive, starting from a logistic age-structured birth and death process, a Feller diffusion with drift and diffusion coefficients that are averages over the age distribution...|$|R

40|$|Living {{systems can}} grow, develop, adapt, <b>and</b> <b>evolve.</b> These <b>phenomena</b> are non-intuitive to {{traditional}} engineers and {{often difficult to}} understand. Yet, classical engineering tools can provide valuable insight into the mechanisms of growth in health and disease. Within the past decade, the concept of incompatible configurations has evolved as a powerful tool to model growing systems {{within the framework of}} nonlinear continuum mechanics. However, there is still a substantial disconnect between the individual disciplines, which explore the phenomenon of growth from different angles. Here we show that the nonlinear field theories of mechanics provide a unified concept to model finite growth by means of a single tensorial internal variable, the second order growth tensor. We review the literature and categorize existing growth models by means of two criteria: the microstructural appearance of growth, either isotropic or anisotropic; and the microenvironmental cues that drive the growth process, either chemical or mechanical. We demonstrate that this generic concept is applicable to a broad range of phenomena such as growing arteries, growing tumors, growing skin, growing airway walls, growing heart valve leaflets, growing skeletal muscle, growing plant stems, growing heart valve annuli, and growing cardiac muscle. The proposed approach has important biological and clinical applications in atherosclerosis, in-stent restenosis, tumor invasion, tissue expansion, chronic bronchitis, mitral regurgitation, limb lengthening, tendon tear, plant physiology, dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and heart failure. Understanding the mechanisms of growth in these chronic conditions may open new avenues in medical device design and personalized medicine to surgically or pharmacologically manipulate development and alter, control, or revert disease progression...|$|R
