5|$|After {{his work}} on Crisler Arena, Dworsky was {{commissioned}} by UCLA to design a track and field stadium on the university's central campus. Dworsky designed the stadium, known as Drake Stadium. Since its inaugural <b>meet</b> <b>on</b> February 22, 1969, the stadium has been the site of numerous championship meets, including the National AAU track & field championships in 1976, 1977, and 1978. It is also used each year for special campus events, such as the annual UCLA Commencement Exercises in June.|$|E
5|$|One of the governor's most {{important}} political powers {{is the ability}} to call a special session of the General Assembly. During a two-year period, the assembly can <b>meet</b> <b>on</b> its own for no more than 91 days, and this often prevents them from passing all the legislation they intend to. This can give the governor considerable influence in the body which will often compromise on issues with him or her in exchange for a special legislative session.|$|E

5|$|At {{one meeting}} in October 1853, he shared the {{platform}} with John B. Horsfall and Chartist leader Ernest Jones, whose Labour Parliament Grimshaw {{was involved in}} the following year as one of the two delegates from Preston, along with Wallace Beever. The Labour Parliament was partly a response to a lock-out of around 20,000 mill workers by the employers in Preston; its aim was to organise a levy on wages to support operatives who went on strike or were locked out. Those paying the levy were to elect a committee to buy and look after land and factories and the Parliament would <b>meet</b> <b>on</b> a yearly basis. However, the plan did not gain support among all Chartists and the plans never materialised.|$|E

5|$|At the 2008 U.S. National Championships in Boston, Liukin fell on {{the floor}} on her double front tuck {{the first day of}} competition, but had a strong <b>meet</b> <b>on</b> her other events and placed second in the {{all-around}} behind Shawn Johnson. She regained her national champion title on the beam and defended her national title on the uneven bars for the fourth consecutive year, scoring a 17.050 in preliminaries and a 17.100 in finals, the highest recorded score for any American gymnast at any event since the advent of the new Code of Points. In June, Liukin competed in the U.S. Olympic Trials in Philadelphia, finishing second behind Johnson and earning a berth on the American team for Beijing.|$|E
5|$|Construction began around 1210 by Bishop Jocelin of Wells but principally {{dates from}} 1230. Bishop Jocelin {{continued}} the cathedral building campaign begun by Bishop Reginald Fitz Jocelin, and {{was responsible for}} building the Bishop's Palace, {{as well as the}} choristers' school, a grammar school, a hospital for travellers and a chapel within the liberty of the cathedral. He also built a manor house at Wookey, near Wells. The chapel and great hall were built between 1275 and 1292 for Bishop Robert Burnell. The windows had stone tracery. Stone bosses where the supporting ribs <b>meet</b> <b>on</b> the ceiling are covered with representations of oak leaves and the Green Man. The building is seen as a fine example of the Early English architectural style.|$|E
5|$|Despite limited {{training}} time on floor and vault {{in the summer}} of 2007, Liukin opted to compete all-around at the 2007 U.S. National Championships. She posted the highest score of the entire <b>meet</b> <b>on</b> bars and the second highest score on beam {{on the second day of}} competition, winning the senior bars title for the third year in a row and placing second on beam. However, she also suffered several falls and errors on floor and vault, and finished in third place overall, more than five points behind Shawn Johnson, the all-around gold medalist.|$|E

5|$|On 23 October 1963, {{four days}} after {{becoming}} Prime Minister, Home disclaimed his earldom and associated lesser peerages. Having been made a knight of the Order of the Thistle in 1962, he was known after stepping down from the Lords as Sir Alec Douglas-Home. The safe Unionist seat of Kinross and West Perthshire was vacant, and Douglas-Home was adopted as his party's candidate. Parliament was due to <b>meet</b> <b>on</b> 24 October after the summer recess, but its return was postponed until 12 November pending the by-election. For twenty days Douglas-Home was Prime Minister while a member of neither house of Parliament, a situation without modern precedent. He won the by-election with a majority of 9,328; the Liberal candidate was in second place and Labour in third.|$|E
5|$|Ricketts Glen is {{the name}} given to the Kitchen Creek valley south and {{downstream}} of Waters Meet. It is 1.8miles (2.9km) between Pennsylvania Route 118 and Waters <b>Meet</b> <b>on</b> the Falls Trail, making this the longest glen. The three northernmost waterfalls are all within 0.5miles (0.80km) of Waters Meet, and are only a short hike {{from the bottom of}} Ganoga Glen or Glen Leigh. The southern part of this glen has large areas of old-growth forest, chiefly hemlocks. Ricketts Glen is entirely in the Catskill Formation and all of the falls on this section of Kitchen Creek have plunge pools.|$|E

Surviving Vader's attack, Starkiller uses the Force to ascertain the senators' and Kota's location: the Death Star. Inside the space station, Starkiller duels Darth Vader and manages to defeat his former master.

5|$|The school cadet corps, a {{national}} program {{now known as}} the Combined Cadet Force, was formed towards the end of 1917 and 120 cadets were recruited within a month. The governors provided £25 towards their initial expenses, and volunteers contributed haversacks, water bottles, dummy rifles and trips to summer camp. Training initially took place on the Tonbridge School rifle range. By 1952, the number of volunteer cadets had fallen to 90. During the 1970s, numbers averaged about 150 cadets. The school's Combined Cadet Force currently comprises both an Army and a Royal Air Force Section with a total establishment strength of 120 cadets, who <b>meet</b> <b>on</b> Friday afternoons following a full school day. Membership remains voluntary, and boys can join from Year Nine (aged 13–14).|$|E

She later tells Rhys that Gilly has sexually assaulted her, reports him to the police and he is charged.|$|E
5|$|Nkomo {{remained}} unchallenged at {{the head}} of ZAPU, but the ZANU leadership had become contested between its founding president, the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole, and Robert Mugabe, a former teacher from Mashonaland who had recently won an internal election in prison. When they were released in December 1974 under the détente terms, Mugabe went to Mozambique to consolidate his leadership of the guerrillas, while Sithole joined Muzorewa's delegation. It had been agreed that the talks would take place within Rhodesia, but the black nationalists refused to <b>meet</b> <b>on</b> ground they perceived as not neutral. The Rhodesians insisted on abiding by the accord and negotiating inside the country. To please both camps the conference was held on a train halfway across the Victoria Falls Bridge on the border between Rhodesia and Zambia; the delegations sat {{on opposite sides of the}} frontier. The conference, which took place on 26 August 1975 with Kaunda and Vorster as mediators, failed to produce a settlement; each side accused the other of being unreasonable. Smith afterwards held direct talks with Nkomo and ZAPU in Salisbury, but these also led nowhere; Nkomo proposed an immediate transition to an interim government headed by himself, which Smith rejected. Guerrilla incursions picked up strongly in the first months of 1976.|$|E
5|$|On September 23, 2011, the NBA {{canceled}} training camp, {{which was}} to begin October 3, and {{the first week of}} preseason games, which were to run October 9 through 15. The incident marks {{only the second time in}} league history that games have been lost to a labor stoppage. Both the owners and the union had planned to <b>meet</b> <b>on</b> September 30 in New York and pledged to continue through the weekends if progress was being made. A source close to the situation leaked to ESPN that Stern plans to threaten the cancellation of the season if no deal is made, but the union sees this as a scare tactic and not a serious threat. Commentators speculated that Stern wants to put pressure on the players and prevent negotiation from dragging through the fall. The meeting on September 30 was tense as Dwyane Wade reportedly yelled at Stern after he pointed his finger at Wade. The players nearly stormed out, but they remained in the meeting only after Hunter asked them to. Stern also backed down from his earlier threat that he would cancel the season if there is no deal.|$|E
