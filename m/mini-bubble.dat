40|$|En vue d'optimiser l'aération de {{substrats}} liquides à forte charge organique dissoute, un système d'aération fonctionnant selon te principe du "cheminement prolongé" a été conçu et construit à l'échelle pilote (3 000 L). Le principe mis à l'essai consiste à injecter de l'air à la base de longs tuyaux enroulés. La dynamique hydraulique du système à cheminement prolongé a été caractérisée. Un système d'aération plus conventionnel, soit un injecteur d'air de type poreux, a été utilisé comme base de comparaison. Les performances d'oxygénation des deux systèmes ont été mesurées dans l'eau, sous les mêmes conditions, puis comparées entre elles et aux valeurs rapportées dans la littérature pour d'autres systèmes. Les principaux résultats montrent que le coefficient de transfert d'oxygène (KL. a) est bon à l'intérieur des tuyaux de l'aérateur à cheminement prolongé (jusqu'à 230 h- 1). Le nouveau prototype démontre également une forte capacité d'emprisonnement de l'air puisque le gonflement atteint 20 %. Finalement, de bonnes efficacités énergétiques ont été obtenues : des valeurs brute de 1. 9 kg O 2 /kWh et nette de 9. 2 kg O 2 /kWh ont été atteintes. Le prototype, tel que construit, a offert des performances. d'oxygénation globales similaires à cettes démontrées par l'injecteur d'air de type poreux, {{le volume}} interne des tuyaux, qui présente un intérêt particulier pour le transfert d'oxygène, ne représentant que 26 % du volume liquide total. L'optimisation de l'aérateur à cheminement prolongé passe donc par l'accroissement maximal du volume interne des tuyaux par rapport au volume liquide total. Cette mesure se traduirait par une augmentation de la capacité d'oxygénation totale et des efficacités physique et énergétique du transfert d'oxygène, ainsi que par une diminution des puissances spécifiques requises. Les performances du système à cheminement prolone dans un liquide chargé en substrat organique restent à étudier, mais les résultats préliminaires obtenus dans l'eau du robinet sont encourageants. Aeration represents the major operating cost {{in the various}} aerobic treatment processes intended for wastewaters or other effluents showing a high dissolved organic load, such as swine manure; it is therefore necessary to maximize the utilization of the oxygen provided to any treatment system. Various types of air injectors and turbines have been studied or built {{in order to achieve}} an adequate oxygenation of liquid wastes to be treated : porous and non-porous injectors, immersed and surface turbines, the latter rotating vertically or horizontally. The aeration performances of these systems appear to be variable; moreover, these systems are not always well adapted to a substrate such as swine manure. With a view to possible application to swine manure treatment, we have designed an "extended contact" pilot-scale aerator (3000 L). The strategy involved injecting air at the basal end of long coiled pipes in which the manure to be treated was circulated. The objective was to increase the time of contact between the air bubbles and the liquid and, consequently, oxygen transfer to the latter. The internal surface of the pipes was large and could become an effective physical support for microbial attachment, thus promoting further digestion. We evaluated the performance of the system with tap water and compared it with a more conventional aeration system, i. e. a porous-type injector also known as a <b>mini-bubble</b> diffusor. Eight oxygenation parameters were evaluated for each of the two systems oxygen transfer coefficient (KL-a), swelling (SWEL), standard oxygenation capacity (SOC), specific standard oxygenation capacity (SSOC), physical efficiency of oxygen transfer [ɛ, cf. Equation (1) ], power consumed (P), specific power injected (SP) and energy efficiency (E). A theoretical simulation of the performances of a hybrid system combining the two aeration principles was carried out. The hydraulic dynamics of the extended-contact system were established through the evaluation of the recirculated flows due to the aerator. The best results obtained were finally compared to those taken from the literature. The main results show the following positive aspects of the extended-contact aerator : 1 - high oxygen transfer coefficients inside the pipes; 2 - high air retention capacity; 3 - good energy efficiency for low air flows. Inside the pipes, values of 230 h- 1 were obtained for KL. a. The new prototype retained up to 546 L of air which corresponds to a swelling of 20 %. A raw energy efficiency of 1. 9 kg O 2 /kWh was obtained, and the net value (based open the net power) was 9. 2 kg O 2 /kWh. The prototype, as constructed, gave oxygenation performances globally similar to those obtained with the porous type air injector {{despite the fact that the}} internal volume of the pipes, which is of special interest for oxygen transfer, was only 26 % of the total liquid volume. The optimization of the extended-contact system therefore calls for a maximal increase of the internal volume of the pipes as compared to the total liquid volume. Ideally, the internal volume should represent 100 % of the total volume. By doing so, oxygenation performances should be improved because of : 1 - increased total oxygenation capacity due to a better overall KL. a; 2 - increased physical efficiency of oxygen transfer (ɛ) in relation to the length of the pipes (in theory, ɛ could reach 100 %); 3 - decreased injected specific power (SP); 4 - increased energy efficiency of oxygen transfer (E). With such improvements in view and considering the requirement : of the aerobic treatment of highly loaded affluents such as swine manure, the extended-contact aerator appears to be a promising aeration technique that still has, however, to be tested under practical conditions...|$|E

40|$|Promising {{technological}} {{applications of}} two-phase flows in space {{have captured the}} increasing interest of the space sector, provoking a strong demand for more fundamental knowledge. Great efforts {{have been made in}} recent decades to study the behavior of two-phase flows in low-gravity environments, which is expected to be different than the behavior observed in the presence of gravitational forces. Nevertheless, many phenomena are still poorly understood. The development of any of these new technologies demands a better knowledge of two-phase flows. In this manuscript we address questions regarding the generation of gas-liquid flows and their behavior in conditions relevant for a microgravity environment. In particular, we focus on an air-water mixture formed in a capillary T-junction. To this end, an experimental setup has been designed to accurately control both gas and liquid flow rates. We performed a quantitative characterization on ground of the T-junction, whose operation is robust to changes in gravity level. Its main performance is the generation of bubbles at a regular frequency with small size dispersion. We obtained two working regimes of the T-junction and identified the crossover region between them. Bubble, slug, churn and annular flow regimes have been observed during the experiments and a flow pattern map has been plotted. We present an experimental study on the bubble-slug transition in microgravity-related conditions. In addition, we address questions regarding the existence of a critical void fraction in order for the bubble-slug transition to occur. The gas-liquid flow has been characterized by measuring the bubble generation frequency as well as the bubble and liquid slug sizes. Since bubble dynamics is also expected to be different in the absence of buoyancy, the bubble velocity has also been studied. The mean void fraction appears as one relevant parameter that allows for the prediction of frequency, bubble velocity, and lengths. We propose curves obtained empirically for the behavior of generation frequency, the bubble velocity and the lengths. The dependence of the frequency on the Strouhal dimensionless number has been analyzed. A numerical study of the formation of <b>mini-bubbles</b> in a 2 D T-junction by means of the fluid dynamics numerical code JADIM is also presented. Simulations were carried out for different flow conditions, giving rise to results on the bubble generation frequency, bubble velocity, void fraction and characteristic lengths. Numerical results have been then compared with experimental data. Postprint (published version...|$|R
