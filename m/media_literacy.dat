In the United States, the ability to read and write are necessary for most jobs, and multiple programs are in place to aid both children and adults in improving their literacy skills. For example, the emergence of the writing center and community-wide literacy councils aim to help students and community members sharpen their writing skills. These resources, and many more, span across different age groups in order to offer each individual a better understanding of their language and how to express themselves via writing in order to perhaps improve their socioeconomic status.|$|E
40|$|This {{case study}} was {{conducted}} in a four-week winter program of an English language center affiliated to a university that is situated in a city in Ontario. Underpinned by theories on new <b>media</b> <b>literacies,</b> actor-network theory, and curriculum, the thesis examines human and nonhuman actors that enabled and constrained students’ new <b>media</b> <b>literacies</b> practices in the English language learning program. Despite {{the fact that there are}} emergent studies on new <b>media</b> <b>literacies,</b> there is scarce literature on human and nonhuman actors that influence students’ new <b>media</b> <b>literacies</b> practices. In this study, sources of data included curricular documents, students’ artifacts, classroom observations of 12 student participants and two instructors, and semi-structured interviews with six student participants. Findings show that students’ new <b>media</b> <b>literacies</b> practices of transmedia navigation, appropriation, judgment, and distributed cognition were enabled in the program whereas the practices of networking, participatory culture, and collective intelligence were constrained to a certain degree. The study also identified human and nonhuman actors that shaped students’ new <b>media</b> <b>literacies</b> practices, such as program design, materiality of classrooms, and individual differences of student participants. This study provides curricular and pedagogical suggestions to English language learning programs in order to enable and expand students’ new <b>media</b> <b>literacies</b> practices and bolster their language learning...|$|R

As Jenkins explained it: [...] "The NML conceptual framework includes an understanding of challenges, new <b>media</b> <b>literacies,</b> and participatory forms. This framework guides thinking about how to provide adults and youth with the opportunity to develop the skills, knowledge, ethical framework, and self-confidence needed to be full participants in the cultural changes which are taking place in response to the influx of new media technologies, and to explore the transformations and possibilities afforded by these technologies to reshape education." [...] Jenkins introduces a range of social skills and cultural competencies that are fundamental for meaningful participation in a participatory culture. The new <b>media</b> <b>literacies</b> areas given particular definitions by this project (as listed here) include: appropriation (education), collective intelligence, distributed cognition, judgment, negotiation, networking, performance, simulation, transmedia navigation, participation gap, the transparency problem, and the ethics problem.|$|R

This paper reports on a design- based research investigation, which focuses on Buckingham’s (2003) Digital <b>Media</b> <b>Literacies</b> Framework and seeks to address the impact that digital media will have on students and teachers now and into the future. The study wishes to explore the interpretations of students as they become creators and producers of their own learning and how pedagogies may need to change across the curriculum. The proposed participants in this study are school students, teachers, academic lecturers and media students from different socio-economic groups in the Sydney and Greater Western Sydney areas. The researcher in this study will look at digital artifacts such as the Learning Federation learning objects and student’s use of Adobe CS 4 and other multimedia software, where students and teachers construct their own learning to evaluate a new pedagogical practice in teaching. In addition, the social software’s such as Facebook and MySpace will also be addressed to determine changes in pedagogies in regards to collaboration in the classroom. Buckingham (2003 p. 185) argues that ‘media education provides a more concrete and coherent framework for addressing teaching and learning.

5000|$|There is no {{national}} {{data on the}} reach of <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> programs in the United States. The evolution of {{information and communication technologies}} has expanded the subject of <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> to incorporate information literacy, collaboration and problem-solving skills, and emphasis on the social responsibilities of communication. Various stakeholders struggle over nuances of meaning associated with the conceptualization of the practice on <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> education. Educational scholars may use the term critical <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> to emphasize the exploration of power and ideology in media analysis. Other scholars may use terms like new <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> to emphasize the application of <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> to user-generated content or 21st century literacy to emphasize the use of technology tools.

40|$|Critical <b>media</b> <b>literacies</b> {{can help}} nurture students’ {{creative}} agencies and engender positive, sustained change in local communities. Kellner and Share (2005) {{have noted that}} students do need to develop faculties with digital technologies but that they must also participate in critical readings of cultural artifacts and discriminate between various multimedia sources. It is important for youth to conceptualize language as perpetuating different kinds of ideologies, for viewpoints are “connected to negotiable, changeable, and sometimes contested stories, histories, knowledge, beliefs, and values encapsulated into cultural models (theories) about the world” (Gee, 2008, p. 29). Semiotic meanings are in constant flux due to individual interests, community dynamics, and sociohistorical contexts, and students need to develop critical stances to better distinguish between authentic narratives, purported truths, and the in-between gray areas of discursive communications. The proliferation of digital and mobile applications expand academic and political boundaries, for within a critical <b>media</b> <b>literacies</b> framework, reading is a collective transaction, learning is a generative act, and political engagement is an accessible and possible achievement. This paper thereby {{provides an overview of}} several significant studies that have interrogated the possibilities of critical media pedagogies in youth spaces. The following sections chart ways in which students can engage with critical <b>media</b> <b>literacies</b> — namely by 1) affording the production of meaningful and authentic autoethnographies, 2) facilitating hospitable connections with near and distant others, and 3) encouraging imaginative self-constructions of identities within virtual communities...|$|R

The task involved developing and creating a wiki on exactly the kind of learning literacies that students were meant to acquire during this enquiry. This dual development was underpinned by the collaborative input of staff from academic and central services departments. Student survey feedback and observation were used to map the various gains in the areas of 1) collaboration and communication skills, 2) information literacy (IL), academic practice (study skills) and employability skills, 3) <b>media</b> and digital/computer <b>literacies</b> and, finally, 4) disciplinary skills. The findings confirm the usefulness of the LLiDA framework as well as point to its potential for further development to map literacies specific to the discipline...|$|R

50|$|In North America, the {{beginnings}} of a formalized approach to <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> as a topic of education is often attributed to the 1978 formation of the Ontario-based Association for <b>Media</b> <b>Literacy</b> (AML). Before that time, instruction in media education was usually the purview of individual teachers and practitioners. Canada was the first country in North America to require <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> in the school curriculum. Every province has mandated media education in its curriculum. For example, the new curriculum of Quebec mandates <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> from Grade 1 until final year of secondary school (Secondary V). The launching of media education in Canada came about for two reasons. One reason was the concern about the pervasiveness of American popular culture and the other was the education system-driven necessity of contexts for new educational paradigms. Canadian communication scholar Marshall McLuhan ignited the North American educational movement for <b>media</b> <b>literacy</b> in the 1950s and 1960s. Two of Canada's leaders in <b>Media</b> <b>Literacy</b> and Media Education are Barry Duncan and John Pungente. Duncan died on June 6, 2012.
