40|$|We {{have reduced}} the {{spectral}} width of high speed oxide confined 850 nm VCSELs using a shallow surface relief for suppression of higher order transverse modes. The surface relief acts as a mode filter by introducing a spatially varying and therefore mode selective loss. The VCSEL employs multiple oxide layers for reduced capacitance {{which leads to a}} strong index guiding and a large spectral width {{in the absence of a}} mode filter. With an appropriate choice of surface relief parameters, the RMS spectral width for a 5 jam oxide aperture VCSEL is reduced from 0. 6 to 0. 3 nm. The small signal modulation bandwidth is 19 GHz. Due to reduced effects of chromatic and <b>modal</b> <b>fiber</b> dispersion, the maximum error-free (bit-error-rate < 10 (- 12)) transmission distance at 25 Gb/s over OM 3 + fiber is increased from 100 to 500 m...|$|E
40|$|The vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) is the {{standard}} light source in optical interconnects connecting racks in supercomputers and datacenters hosting services such as online data sharing, storage and processing. VCSELs have numerous advantages such as low power consumption, fast direct modulation at low currents, circular output beam for efficient fiber coupling and low-cost fabrication. However, today's commercial optical interconnects, operating at around 10 Gbit/s over up to 300 m of multimode fiber, have insufficient speed and reach for future datacenters. The goal of this work has been to extend the maximum reach of GaAs-based 850 nm VCSEL-based optical interconnects. Recently developed high-speed VCSELs featuring strained InGaAs quantum wells and multiple oxide layers are highly transverse multimode with large root-mean-square (RMS) spectral widths around 1 nm. This leads to problems with chromatic and <b>modal</b> <b>fiber</b> dispersion, limiting the maximum reach to around 100 m at 25 Gbit/s. By using quasi-single mode VCSELs with a side-mode suppression ratio of ~ 15 - 20 dB and RMS spectral widths around 0. 3 nm, the reduced dispersive effects enable extended reach at high data rates. Two different techniques to reduce the spectral width are investigated. By using a small oxide aperture, the number of modes guided by the VCSEL waveguide is significantly reduced. A 3 um oxide aperture VCSEL was used to transmit 22 Gbit/s over 1100 m of OM 4 fiber. However, small aperture devices have high resistance and relatively low output power. The spectral width of larger aperture VCSELs can be reduced by etching a shallow surface relief that induces a mode selective loss to suppress higher order modes. In effect, the etched feature acts as an integrated mode filter. A 6 um oxide aperture surface relief VCSEL enabled transmission at 20 Gbit/s over 2000 m of fiber, setting a new bit-rate-distance product record for directly modulated 850 nm VCSEL links. Benefits and drawbacks of both methods are discussed and compared...|$|E

40|$|Recently, a {{new class}} of sensors has emerged for {{structural}} control which respond to environmental changes over a significant gauge length; these sensors are called distributed-effect sensors. These sensors can be fabricated with spatially varying sensitivity to the distributed measurand, and can be configured to measure a variety of structural parameters which can not be measured directly using point sensors. Examples of distributed-effect sensors include piezoelectric film, holographic sensors, and <b>modal</b> domain optical <b>fiber</b> sensors. Optical fiber sensors are particularly attractive for smart structure applications because they are flexible, have low mass, and can easily be embedded directly into materials. In this paper we describe the implementation of weighted <b>modal</b> domain optical <b>fiber</b> sensors.

40|$|The vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) is the {{standard}} light source in short-reach fiber-optic links in datacenters and supercomputers. These systems use {{an enormous number of}} links, making cost and energy efficiency pressing issues. GaAs-based 850 nm VCSELs are therefore attractive due to low-cost fabrication, a small device footprint enabling compact integration into 2 -D arrays, and above all, the capability of high-speed direct modulation at low power consumption. However, present commercial VCSELs, operating at around 25 Gbit/s over up to 100 m of multimode fiber, have insufficient speed, energy-efficiency, and reach for future links. Many of the attractive VCSEL properties stem from their small modal and active region volumes. The first part of this thesis explores the limits of optical and electrical confinement in high-speed VCSELs by using the shortest possible cavity length, and positioning the current-confining oxide aperture close to the active region. This enabled small-oxide-aperture VCSELs with record-high modulation bandwidth of 30 GHz, capable of energy-efficient data transmission at 25 - 50 Gbit/s with record-low dissipated energy per bit in the VCSEL of < 100 fJ/bit. High-speed VCSELs are usually transverse multimode with large spectral widths. This leads to penalties from chromatic and <b>modal</b> <b>fiber</b> dispersion, limiting the feasible transmission distance to around 100 m at 25 Gbit/s, which is too short for large datacenters. The second part of this thesis demonstrates that VCSELs with narrow spectral widths, realized using either a small oxide aperture or an integrated mode filter, can transmit data at high bit rates over much longer distances. VCSELs with mode filters enabled transmission at 20 Gbit/s over 2000 m, setting a bit-rate-distance product record for directly modulated 850 nm VCSEL links. To enable higher link capacity, wavelength division multiplexing may be used, where several channels at different wavelengths are transmitted in the same fiber. The final part of the thesis presents the design, fabrication, and experimental results for monolithically integrated 980 nm multi-wavelength VCSEL arrays. By using high-contrast gratings with different parameters as top mirrors, the VCSEL resonance wavelength may be set in a post-growth process. Lasing over a wavelength span of 15 nm was realized...|$|E

50|$|The LED light sources {{sometimes}} used with multi-mode fiber produce {{a range of}} wavelengths and these each propagate at different speeds. This chromatic dispersion is another limit to the useful length for multi-mode fiber optic cable. In contrast, the lasers used to drive single-mode fibers produce coherent light of a single wavelength. Because of the <b>modal</b> dispersion, multi-mode <b>fiber</b> has higher pulse spreading rates than single mode fiber, limiting multi-mode fiber’s information transmission capacity.|$|R
5000|$|Like {{multi-mode}} optical fibers, single-mode <b>fibers</b> do exhibit <b>modal</b> dispersion {{resulting from}} multiple spatial modes but with narrower <b>modal</b> dispersion. Single-mode <b>fibers</b> are therefore better at retaining the fidelity of each light pulse over longer distances than multi-mode fibers.

Therefore, the manufacturing process leaves few characteristics distinctive of the natural source material in the finished products.|$|R
40|$|A {{method to}} predict modal noise in short {{distance}} (30 m), high temporal bandwidth (hundreds of MHz) multimode optical links is proposed. In order to accommodate low cost, mechanical alignment, the link medium is modified from {{single mode fiber}} (used routinely in telecommunication systems) to multimode <b>fiber.</b> <b>Modal</b> dispersion in multimode fiber calls for a reduction in link length to preserve a relatively high temporal bandwidth. The source is a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL), which is well suited for the high packaging density, high temporal bandwidth, and low power dissipation requirements of short distance optical communication systems. Coherence properties of several different types of VCSELs are experimentally examined with constant and modulated injection current with a bandwidth typical of that used in data communications systems. A fluctuation in the spatial irradiance output pattern of the VCSEL is identified as the dynamic component responsible for significant modal noise effects. The effect of finite system coherence length {{has been applied to}} the simulation process.

40|$|Many {{chemical}} or physical modification processes significantly influence {{the accessibility of}} fiber forming polymers by causing structural changes. The wettability and sorption ability improvements of polymeric materials are major tasks during finishing processes. Different pre-treatment processes are used {{in order to improve}} the accessibility of dissociable groups, hydrophilicity, dyeability, and whiteness. These are usually alkaline purification, chemical bleaching and mercerization. In a previous paper we presented the data for structural characteristics (density, crystallinity index, molecular orientation, void volume, diameter and the specific inner surface of void, etc.) of untreated regenerated cellulose <b>fibers</b> (viscose, <b>modal</b> and lyocell) [41]. We now compare the influence of different pre-treatment processes on fiber structure and the accessibility of the chemical groups of these fibers. In order to improve the accessibility, two pre-treatment processes were used: chemical bleaching of fibers and tensionless alkali treatment. The influence of these pre-treatment processes on the structure parameters was evaluated using viscosity measurements (determination of polymerization degree (DIN 54 270)) and iodine sorption ability measurements according to the Schwertassek method (determination of crystallinity index) [13, 16]. The reactivity and accessibility in a polar environment was determined using tensiometry. Contact angles between the fibers and liquids of different polarities were determined using the powder contact angle method and calculated from a modified Washburn equation [26, 28]. The surface free (Helmholtz) energy of differently treated fibers was determined from the contact angle data using the Owens-Wendt-Raeble-Kaelble approximation [30, 33, 35]. The differences in the accessibility of raw and pre-treated regenerated cellulose fibers obtained using tensiometry are compared with the results of the conventional method used to determine moisture adsorption (DIN 54 351, DIN 53 802). In regard to raw fibers, viscose shows the most hydrophilic characteristic: adsorbs the highest amount of moisture, has the fastest penetration velocities (Fig. 6), the smallest contact angle, and the highest SFE (Fig. 8). <b>Modal</b> <b>fibers</b> have the largest contact angle, the lowest SFE, and they adsorb the smallest amount of water vapor. Pre-treatments increase the sorption ability and the surface free (Helmholtz) energy while they decrease the contact angle. This makes the material more accessible to water and chemicals used in the finishing processes although the crystallinity index increases. The main modification in polymer properties caused by the treatments is an increase in the fiber SFE caused by an increase of the fiber surfaces because of swelling in the alkaline medium (washing, slack-mercerization), and due to an increase of accessible OH- and COOH-groups (bleaching). This enables the formation of an increased number of hydrogen bridges between the water molecules and the OH- and COOH-groups. Our investigations confirm the results published earlier thatthe main property necessary for the proper sorption behavior of cellulose materials are the accessible, less ordered regions and not the degree of crystallinity...|$|R
