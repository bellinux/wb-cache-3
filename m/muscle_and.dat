5|$|S-glutathionylation: fsTnI {{was found}} to be S-glutathionylated at Cys133 in rodent fast-twitch {{skeletal}} <b>muscle</b> <b>and</b> in human type II muscle fibers after exercise, which increased Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile apparatus.|$|E
5|$|A {{sea anemone}} {{is capable of}} {{changing}} its shape dramatically. The column and tentacles have longitudinal, transverse and diagonal sheets of <b>muscle</b> <b>and</b> can lengthen and contract, as well as bend and twist. The gullet and mesenteries can evert (turn inside out), or the oral disc and tentacles can retract inside the gullet, with the sphincter closing the aperture; during this process, the gullet folds transversely and water is discharged through the mouth.|$|E

50|$|Metabolic alkalosis {{is usually}} {{accompanied}} by low blood potassium concentration, causing, e.g., muscular weakness, <b>muscle</b> pain, <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> cramps (from disturbed {{function of the}} skeletal <b>muscles),</b> <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> spasms (from disturbed function of smooth muscles).|$|R
5|$|As the {{structure}} of the back is complex and the reporting of pain is subjective and affected by social factors, the diagnosis of low back pain is not straightforward. While most low back pain is caused by <b>muscle</b> <b>and</b> joint problems, this cause must be separated from neurological problems, spinal tumors, fracture of the spine, and infections, among others.|$|E
5|$|At the 2006 San Diego Comic-Con, the TMNT panel {{screened}} {{an exclusive}} preview that contained a Splinter voice-over with facial tests, concept art, <b>muscle</b> <b>and</b> dynamic fight tests, {{and a few}} comedic scenes. A sneak peek booklet containing storyboards, environment designs and character designs by comic artist Jeff Matsuda was also distributed at the convention.|$|E
5|$|Copper is {{essential}} to all living organisms as a trace dietary mineral {{because it is a}} key constituent of the respiratory enzyme complex cytochrome c oxidase. In molluscs and crustaceans, copper is a constituent of the blood pigment hemocyanin, replaced by the iron-complexed hemoglobin in fish and other vertebrates. In humans, copper is found mainly in the liver, <b>muscle,</b> <b>and</b> bone. The adult body contains between 1.4 and 2.1mg of copper per kilogram of body weight.|$|E

They supply the intercostal <b>muscles</b> <b>and,</b> by branches which perforate the Intercostales externi, the Pectoral <b>muscles</b> <b>and</b> the mamma.|$|R
25|$|Ischemic {{heart disease}} causes MI by the {{combination}} of ischemic dysfunction of the papillary <b>muscles,</b> <b>and</b> the dilatation of the left ventricle. This {{can lead to the}} subsequent displacement of the papillary <b>muscles</b> <b>and</b> the dilatation of the mitral valve annulus.|$|R

5|$|The {{esophagus}} is {{innervated by}} the vagus nerve and the cervical and thoracic sympathetic trunk. The vagus nerve has a parasympathetic function, supplying {{the muscles of}} the esophagus and stimulating glandular contraction. Two sets of nerve fibers travel in the vagus nerve to supply the muscles. The upper striated <b>muscle,</b> <b>and</b> upper esophageal sphincter, are supplied by neurons with bodies in the nucleus ambiguus, whereas fibers that supply the smooth <b>muscle</b> <b>and</b> lower esophageal sphincter have bodies situated in the dorsal motor nucleus. The vagus nerve plays the primary role in initiating peristalsis. The sympathetic trunk has a sympathetic function. It may enhance the function of the vagus nerve, increasing peristalsis and glandular activity, and causing sphincter contraction. In addition, sympathetic activation may relax the muscle wall and cause blood vessel constriction. Sensation along the esophagus is supplied by both nerves, with gross sensation being passed in the vagus nerve and pain passed up the sympathetic trunk.|$|E
5|$|The {{lightness}} and rigidity of {{the blade}} compared to <b>muscle</b> <b>and</b> bone may allow blade runners to swing their legs faster than non-disabled runners. In comments on the article, Peter Weyand and biomechanist Matthew Bundle noted that {{the study found that}} Pistorius re-positioned his legs 15.7 percent faster than most world record sprinters, allowing for a 15 to 30 percent increase in sprint speed.|$|E
5|$|The skins of {{cephalopods}} {{such as the}} octopus contain complex units, each {{consisting of}} a chromatophore with surrounding <b>muscle</b> <b>and</b> nerve cells. The cephalopod chromatophore has all its pigment grains in a small elastic sac, which can be stretched or allowed to relax {{under the control of}} the brain to vary its opacity. By controlling chromatophores of different colours, cephalopods can rapidly change their skin patterns and colours.|$|E
5000|$|GPP is {{the initial}} stage of {{training}}. It starts every cycle of training from the macro-, meso- and microcycle after restoration and recovery. It consists primarily of general preparatory and some specialized conditioning exercises to {{work all the}} major <b>muscles</b> <b>and</b> joints. This preparation prepares the athlete for the more intense training such as explosive plyometrics. This period is also used for rehabilitation of injured <b>muscles</b> <b>and</b> joints, strengthening or bringing up to par the lagging <b>muscles</b> <b>and</b> improvement of technique.|$|R
40|$|Muscle {{tissue to}} examine {{was taken from}} 31 Black-and-White bull-calves of West Siberia, aged 18 months. The {{concentration}} of 11 trace elements in the samples of the muscle tissue was determined with the method of atomic emission spectrometry with inductively associated plasma. The concentration of heavy metals (mg/kg) in the muscle tissue was equal to: Pb – 0. 070; Cd – 0. 015; As – 0. 305; Sr – 0. 255; Rb – 1. 458; Cu – 1. 571; Fe – 50. 884; Zn – 52. 99; Hg – 0. 007; Ni – 0. 069.

5|$|Women {{may have}} acute {{low back pain}} from medical {{conditions}} affecting the female reproductive system, including endometriosis, ovarian cysts, ovarian cancer, or uterine fibroids. Nearly half of all pregnant women report pain in the lower back or sacral area during pregnancy, due to changes in their posture and center of gravity causing <b>muscle</b> <b>and</b> ligament strain.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the lower}} {{respiratory}} tract including the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles is lined with respiratory epithelium. This is a ciliated epithelium interspersed with goblet cells which produce mucus, and club cells with actions similar to macrophages. Incomplete rings of cartilage in the trachea and smaller plates of cartilage in the bronchi, keep these airways open. Bronchioles are too narrow to support cartilage and their walls are of smooth <b>muscle,</b> <b>and</b> this is largely absent in the narrower respiratory bronchioles which are mainly just of epithelium. The respiratory tract ends in lobules. Each lobule consists of a respiratory bronchiole, which branches into alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs, which in turn divide into alveoli.|$|E

5|$|Amphibians have a {{skeletal}} {{system that is}} structurally homologous to other tetrapods, though {{with a number of}} variations. They all have four limbs except for the legless caecilians and a few species of salamander with reduced or no limbs. The bones are hollow and lightweight. The musculo{{skeletal system}} is strong to enable it to support the head and body. The bones are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other by means of overlapping processes. The pectoral girdle is supported by <b>muscle,</b> <b>and</b> the well-developed pelvic girdle is attached to the backbone by a pair of sacral ribs. The ilium slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammals.|$|E
5|$|As the {{blizzard}} progressed, Patrick Dolan began to rant deliriously, stripped off his clothes, {{and ran into}} the woods. He returned shortly afterwards and died a few hours later. Not long after, possibly because 12-year-old Lemuel Murphy was near death, some of the group began to eat flesh from Dolan's body. Lemuel's sister tried to feed some to her brother, but he died shortly afterwards. Eddy, Salvador, and Luis refused to eat. The next morning, the group stripped the <b>muscle</b> <b>and</b> organs from the bodies of Antonio, Dolan, Graves, and Murphy and dried it to store for the days ahead, taking care to ensure that nobody would have to eat his or her relatives.|$|E

5|$|Bees {{beat their}} wings about 200 times a second. Their thorax muscles do not {{contract}} on each nerve firing, but rather vibrate like a plucked rubber band. This is efficient, since it lets the system consisting of <b>muscle</b> <b>and</b> wing operate at its resonant frequency, leading to low energy consumption. Further, it is necessary, since insect motor nerves generally cannot fire 200 times per second. These types of muscles are called asynchronous muscles and {{are found in}} the insect wing systems in families such as Hymenoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, and Hemiptera. Bumblebees must warm up their bodies considerably to get airborne at low ambient temperatures. Bumblebees have been known to reach an internal thoracic temperature of 30°C (86°F) using this method.|$|E
5|$|Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne {{tropical}} disease {{caused by the}} dengue virus. Symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days after infection. This may include a high fever, headache, vomiting, <b>muscle</b> <b>and</b> joint pains, and a characteristic skin rash. Recovery generally takes two to seven days. In {{a small proportion of}} cases, the disease develops into the life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever, resulting in bleeding, low levels of blood platelets and blood plasma leakage, or into dengue shock syndrome, where dangerously low blood pressure occurs.|$|E
5|$|Dysregulation of the {{ubiquitin}} proteasome {{system may}} contribute to several neural diseases. It may lead to brain tumors such as astrocytomas. In some of the late-onset neurodegenerative diseases that share aggregation of misfolded proteins as a common feature, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, large insoluble aggregates of misfolded proteins can form and then result in neurotoxicity, through mechanisms that are not yet well understood. Decreased proteasome activity has been suggested {{as a cause of}} aggregation and Lewy body formation in Parkinson's. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that yeast models of Parkinson's are more susceptible to toxicity from α-synuclein, the major protein component of Lewy bodies, under conditions of low proteasome activity. Impaired proteasomal activity may underlie cognitive disorders such as the autism spectrum disorders, and <b>muscle</b> <b>and</b> nerve diseases such as inclusion body myopathy.|$|E

40|$|For an {{accurate}} assessment of jaw movement, {{it is crucial}} to understand the comprehensive formation of the masticatory muscles with special reference to the relationship to the disc of the temporomandibular joint. Detailed dissection was performed on 26 head halves of 14 Japanese cadavers in order to obtain precise anatomical information of the positional relationships between the masticatory <b>muscles</b> <b>and</b> the branches of the mandibular nerve. After complete removal of the bony elements, the midmedial muscle bundle in all specimens <b>and</b> the discotemporal <b>muscle</b> bundle in 6 specimens, derivatives of the temporalis, which insert into the disc were observed. On the anterior area of the articular capsule and the disc of the temporomandibular joint, the upper head of the lateral pterygoid, the midmedial muscle bundle of temporalis and the discotemporal bundle of temporalis were attached mediolaterally, and in 3 specimens the posterosuperior margin of the zygomaticomandibularis was attached to the anterolateral area of the disc. It is suggested that these <b>muscles</b> <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> bundles contribute to various mandibular movements. Although various patterns of the positional relationships between the <b>muscles</b> <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> bundles <b>and</b> the their innervating nerves are observed in the present study, relative positional relationships of the <b>muscles</b> <b>and</b> <b>muscle</b> bundles <b>and</b> of nerves of the mandibular nerve are consistent.
