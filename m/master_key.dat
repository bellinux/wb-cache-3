Bart and Ralph thus steal {{the key and}} decide to enter several closed stores at night. After encountering Nelson and his gang, the boys go to a {{condemned}} penitentiary. When Ralph objects because he is afraid, the bullies leave, but not before tossing the key into the penitentiary. Ralph and Bart enter the prison to retrieve the key, {{and in the process}} stumble onto a room housing an old electric chair. After testing out the chair, the two flee when an elderly guard approaches.|$|E
25|$|From a {{security}} standpoint, SSL 3.0 {{should be considered}} less desirable than TLS 1.0. The SSL 3.0 cipher suites have a weaker key derivation process; half of the <b>master</b> <b>key</b> that is established is fully dependent on the MD5 hash function, which is not resistant to collisions and is, therefore, not considered secure. Under TLS 1.0, the <b>master</b> <b>key</b> that is established depends on both MD5 and SHA-1 so its derivation process is not currently considered weak. It {{is for this reason}} that SSL 3.0 implementations cannot be validated under FIPS 140-2.|$|E

However, he returned to the series each time, persuaded by popular demand, letters from children, and the failure of his new books. Even so, his other works remained very popular after his death, with The <b>Master</b> <b>Key</b> appearing on St. Nicholas Magazines survey of readers' favorite books well into the 1920s.|$|E

The photograph was later removed from the original Washington Post article, but it still appears in some syndicated copies of the article. On August 22, 2015, Twitter user Luke Rudkowski (@Lukewearechange) noticed the photograph and posted it on Twitter, and from there it quickly spread across social media, gaining the attention of news sites. Using the photograph, security researchers {{and members of the}} public have been able to reproduce working copies of the <b>master</b> <b>keys</b> using 3D printing techniques. The incident has prompted discussion about the security implications of using <b>master</b> <b>keys.</b>|$|R

25|$|Blue overhears Blondie {{relaying}} Babydoll's plan to Gorski, confirming {{his suspicions}} {{that something is}} amiss. He has Sweet Pea locked in a utility closet and confronts the other girls backstage. He shoots Amber and Blondie and attempts to rape Babydoll, but she stabs him with the kitchen knife and steals his <b>master</b> <b>key.</b> Babydoll frees Sweet Pea and starts a fire to keep the orderlies occupied while they look for an exit. They escape into the courtyard, where they find a throng of men blocking their way. Babydoll deduces that the fifth item needed for the escape is in fact her own sacrifice. She concludes that this is actually Sweet Pea's story. Despite Sweet Pea's protests, she insists on revealing herself to the visitors, thus distracting them long enough to allow her friend to slip away unnoticed.|$|E
25|$|The {{first public}} police {{telephones}} in Britain {{were introduced in}} Glasgow in 1891. These tall, hexagonal, cast-iron boxes were painted red and had large gas lanterns fixed to the roof, {{as well as a}} mechanism which enabled the central police station to light the lanterns as signals to police officers in the vicinity to call the station for instructions. As with Chicago's boxes, the original intent was that trusted members of the public would be allowed access to the telephone in case of emergency using a special key that was registered to them, which would remain trapped in the lock until released by a <b>master</b> <b>key</b> carried by a policeman. A newer, rectangular type of cast-iron police box was introduced in Glasgow in 1912, but with the signal light now powered by electricity rather than gas, and access to the telephone now restricted solely to the police.|$|E

500|$|Flynn reveals to Sam that he {{had been}} working to create a [...] "perfect" [...] {{computer}} system and had appointed Clu and Tron (a security program created by Bradley) its co-creators. During this construction, the trio discovered a species of naturally occurring [...] "isomorphic algorithms" [...] (ISOs) not conceived by Flynn, bearing the potential to resolve various mysteries in science, religion and medicine. Clu, considering them an aberration, betrayed Flynn, seemingly killed Tron, and destroyed the ISOs. Meanwhile, the [...] "I/O portal" [...] permitting travel between the two worlds had closed, leaving Flynn trapped in the system. Having gained complete control, Clu sent the message to Alan in order to lure Sam onto the Grid and reopen the portal for a limited time.

2500|$|The use of {{nucleotide}} sequence variations to investigate evolutionary relationships {{is not a}} new concept. Carl Woese used sequence differences in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) to discover archaea, which in turn led to the redrawing of the evolutionary tree, and molecular markers (e.g., allozymes, rDNA, and mtDNA sequences) have been successfully used in molecular systematics for decades. DNA barcoding provides a standardised method for this process via the use of a short DNA sequence from a particular region of the genome to provide a 'barcode' for identifying species. In 2003, Paul D.N. Hebert from the University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada, proposed the compilation of a public library of DNA barcodes that would be linked to named specimens. This library would [...] "provide a new <b>master</b> <b>key</b> for identifying species, one whose power will rise with increased taxon coverage and with faster, cheaper sequencing".|$|E

50|$|Note {{that there}} is a {{difference}} between <b>master</b> <b>keys</b> and session <b>keys.</b> <b>Master</b> <b>keys</b> are long-lived and usually work as a shared secret or a means to distribute session keys, which in turn do not outlive the connection for which they were created and usually serve as the functional encryption/decryption mechanism. A specific header field indicates which of the possible keys is to be used. It is also important to note that replay prevention mechanisms require the keeping of counters which are updated on valid receptions. The range of these counters further limits the life of session keys.|$|R
2500|$|Lyman Frank Baum (May 15, 1856 – May 6, 1919), {{better known}} as L. Frank Baum, was an American author chiefly famous for his children's books, {{particularly}} The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and its sequels. He wrote a total of 14 novels in the Oz series, plus 41 other novels, 83 short stories, over 200 poems, and at least 42 scripts. He made numerous attempts to bring his works to the stage and the nascent medium of film; the 1939 adaptation of the first Oz book would become a landmark of 20th century cinema. His works anticipated such century-later commonplaces as television, augmented reality, laptop computers (The <b>Master</b> <b>Key),</b> wireless telephones (Tik-Tok of Oz), women in high-risk and action-heavy occupations (Mary Louise in the Country), police corruption and false evidence (Phoebe Daring), and the ubiquity of advertising on clothing (Aunt Jane's Nieces at Work).|$|E
