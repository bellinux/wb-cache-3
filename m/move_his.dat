5|$|At school, Brinkley was {{introduced}} to the study of glandular extracts and their effects on the human system.

5|$|Casey {{and some}} members of his staff came ashore on A-Day; the advance echelon of his ASCOM {{headquarters}} arrived two days later. Work began immediately on the airfield at Tacloban, and commenced on airfields in central Leyte soon after they were captured. Heavy seasonal rains thwarted attempts to develop the airbases in central Leyte and {{it was decided to}} abandon their development and construct a new airbase on the coast at a site occupied by Sixth Army headquarters.

5|$|For the French, {{despite their}} success earlier at Frauenfeld, {{the action was}} {{considerably}} less successful. In the clash, Ney was sufficiently wounded that he took immediate leave, and remained out of action and command until 22 July. The conduct of the battle also demonstrated {{the weakness of the}} French command system in which personal animosity and competition between high-ranking officers, in this case, Soult and Tharreau, undermined French military objectives. Tharreau eventually charged Soult with insubordination; Soult had outright refused to go to Ney's assistance, despite specific, and direct, orders to <b>move</b> <b>his</b> division to Ney's flanks.|$|E

Three days later, he got a second opinion from a doctor at Manchester Royal Infirmary. An X-ray revealed he had dislocated five vertebrae, the second of which was cracked in two. The third vertebra had wedged against the second, preventing further damage which could have cost Trautmann his life.|$|E
