Amien Rais also was active in the newly established ICMI ( [...] Ikatan Cendikiawan Muslim Indonesia [...] ), the Muslim Scholars Association. Rais led ICMI's Expert Council, but resigned in 1997 under pressure from Suharto because he argued on the Busang and the Freeport cases. In 1995, Rais replaced Azhar Basyir, then the chairman of Muhammadiyah, who died soon after his re-election. In 1993, at a Muhammadiyah <b>mid-term</b> <b>meeting</b> ( [...] Tanwir [...] ) in Surabaya, Rais urged a presidential succession, a very rare issue amid the New Order regime. The political and economical decay in Indonesia during the 90s had Rais call a comprehensive issue: the political reform. Amien Rais was eventually a forerunner in crushing the New Order regime.

World Bank representative G. Edward Schuh presented a paper {{on the need to}} diversify out of rice production in Asia. TAC Chairman Camus reported on TAC 41, and presented, with others, the activities of the Task Force on Sub Saharan Africa. CBC and CDC chairmen also reported. The latter addressed the growth of restricted funding of centers. Abbas Kesseba of IFAD reported on an international consultation on strengthening national programs, with emphasis on devolving research and training in rice and wheat to strong NARS. The Executive Secretary, Curtis Farrar, presented a study of scientific collaboration between IARCs and European research institutions prepared by Rudi Binsack. Amir Muhammed presented a TAC paper on IARC collaboration with other research institutions. Farrar and TAC member McCalla led a discussion of the new resource allocation process, notably the introduction of center medium term plans covering funding for five years. McCalla also presented a paper on TAC's role in recommending and monitoring CGIAR priorities. Vernon Ruttan summarized his study of the process of external review of the centers. There was a consensus that reviews should shift toward strategic issues, and flexibility in timing. A TAC/CGIAR Secretariat paper on reviews would be considered at ICW 1987.

The Chairman appointed a TAC-CGIAR Secretariat group to prepare a paper on the review process for joint discussion with the center directors at TAC 43. TAC reviewed medium term plans for ISNAR and IFPRI. Revised versions would be considered together with MTPs of CIP, IBPGR, and ILRAD at TAC 43.

Thanks also express to Saowaruj Rattanakhumfu and Sujittra Rossomboon for their {{assistant}} in data and information gathering. 2 This paper seeks to review the highlights of major trends in international migration both from East Asia to OECD member countries and within East Asian countries, focusing on the movement of highly skilled workers. Currently there are large outflows of workers from less-advanced East Asian countries to the more advanced economies {{of the region and}} to OECD member groups. Special reference is made to the movement of highly qualified foreign workers, which are a focal point of the “brain-drain ” versus “braincirculation” debates in the international community. The study sheds light on these important debates. It examines the effects of migration of highly skilled workers on the sending and receiving countries. Different OECD policies concerning such highly skilled migrants have led to various effects on economic development in East Asia. It provides discussion of some “policy coherence ” questions. The paper also provides comparisons of ways to cope with problem of illegal migrations in OECD and East Asia. The similarities and differences between policies on combating illegal entry into OECD and non-OECD countries are briefly examined. Last but not least, the paper recommends that it is in the interests of East Asian countries to explore the usefulness of diaspora networks or communities as an alternative to reverse the “brain-drain”, or enhance the return options of overseas nationals. A “diaspora centre ” may be established in order to seek cooperation from nationals abroad in exchanging talent or knowledge without uprooting them from the countries where they work...|$|R

40|$|Service-Learning (S-L) {{has been}} proven in many studies {{to be a good}} means for {{promoting}} university students’ civic / community engagement (e. g. Vickers, Harris 2 ̆ 6 McCarthy, 2004; Astin et al., 2006). A vast majority of the services in S-L courses in Higher Education take place in partnering service agencies and communities they serve, such as elderly homes and social enterprises. The idea that university campus is a community with unique needs and therefore a potential service site is often neglected. There are indeed social needs within university campuses, such as food waste (e. g. UC Berkeley, 2012; The City University of Hong Kong, 2012) and food insecurity (e. g. The Florida State University, 2013), which have been identified and addressed by students and faculty, albeit few. At Lingnan University, Hong Kong, the Office of S-L offers an introductory S-L course, titled Community Engagement through Service-Learning. Students are exposed to the basic S-L theories and engage in discussion related to social welfare, a selection of social issues, S-L and critical reflection. They are also required to design, implement and evaluate a S-L project that addresses a specific need on the Lingnan campus. This study aims to explore the impact of different service site arrangements on students’ perceived learning outcomes (with regard to the generic intended outcomes for all S-L courses in the university) and service experience. This will be done qualitatively, by analysing the contents of students’ group project proposals and final reports, {{as well as that of}} a <b>mid-term</b> reflective <b>meeting</b> and an end-of-term focus group with the students (N= 7).

The review panel recommended further development of ICLARM's tactical plan for Africa and West Asia, and the representation of other countries from the region on the staff at the regional headquarters in Egypt. It suggested use of external mechanisms for the review of all ICLARM research. The panel also suggested that ICLARM find an alternative to the ten year limit on staff tenure. The center should continue on the path it is on, and seek additional resources. TAC was encouraged to note a major effort at strategic planning.

The {{document}} also contains {{an excerpt from the}} report of the CGIAR 1999 Mid Term Meeting, a transmittal from the TAC Chair and CGIAR Executive Secretary, TAC's commentary, ILRI's response, and a transmittal from the review panel chair. The report was favorably reviewed by an ad hoc committee, whose report was adopted by the CGIAR. There was unanimous praise for the manner in which ILRAD and ILCA had been combined in 1995 into ILRI, with some aspects cited as models in case of future mergers. TAC suggested that the social science research at ILRI was not covered thoroughly, but the report was otherwise complete. It found ILRI's formal report incomplete. The CGIAR asked ILRI to make a report at ICW 1999 on progress in implementing the fourteen recommendations of the review and those of the ad hoc committee. The committee asked ILRI to communicate with CGIAR members and others engaged in livestock research to sharpen its answers to strategic issues concerning ILRI research. This corresponded with a panel recommendation that IFPRI sharpen its priorities, and focus on fewer areas to ensure scientific quality and increased impact. A Deputy Director General to oversee the research program was recommended, as part of a realignment of ILRI's research structure. The panel recommended a more proactive role for the board in the strategic planning area, and a sharper delineation of the line between board and management responsibilities. It also suggested that networks should emphasize collaborative research with NARS as opposed to capacity building.

President Suharto of Indonesia opened the meeting. Pakistan and Syria joined. The CGIAR agreed with a {{stakeholders}} group that TAC should become more strategic, and planned a system review to be overseen by a stakeholders committee. The Group endorsed reports from a preparatory meeting for the Global Forum, the NGO and private sector committees. TAC recommended priorities and strategies were broadly endorsed with increased emphasis on networking and training. Parallel sessions considered soil and water research, root and tuber crops, post harvest technology, policy and management research, institution strengthening research and service, complementarities between NARS and CGIAR priorities, and allocations to various CGIAR activities. The Group endorsed the 1997 research agenda and funding as presented by TAC. It urged continued participation in international negotiations on genetic resources, and asked IPGRI to form a policy unit. By switching complementary activities to core, and raising additional funds, the Group achieved full funding of the 1996 research agenda and triggered the full World Bank contribution. Financing arrangements were modified for the future, with 1997 as a transition year. The Group approved ICLARM's decision, opposed by TAC, to accept facilities at Abbassa offered by the Government of Egypt. It approved a guideline on the roles, responsibilities, and accountability of center boards. The Oversight Committee and the IAEG reported. The CGIAR asked its task force on Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union to talk with states in that region and present a strategy for cooperation at ICW 96.

The meeting was opened by representatives of the Indian Government, {{including}} Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao. The meeting was held {{against the background of}} a significant CGIAR financial crisis. The Group approved proposals made by the Chairman in his opening address for an 18 month plan of action, including a high level international conference in January 1995. Emphasis was placed on changes in governance that would result in predictability, transparency, and accountability. The Chairman announced a special additional World Bank grant of $ 20 million to match (on a 1 for 2 ratio) additional funds from other donors for CGIAR core programs in 1994 / 1995. After reviewing several forward looking documents, the Group decided to approve a vision statement at ICW 94 as a basic document for the high level conference. Discussion of Oversight Committee reports on governance and organization resulted {{in the creation of a}} 15 member Steering Committee, composed of the continuing Oversight and Finance Committees. The Group decided to move over two years to a matrix framework for CGIAR programs. Contributions from other donors for activities within the matrix would draw 15 % matching funds from the World Bank. There were several decisions on genetic resources policy, and their management, based on a stripe review. An Oversight Committee study of policy towards Eastern Europe and the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union was approved.
