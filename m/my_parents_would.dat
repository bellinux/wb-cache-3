500|$|China, {{and many}} other Asian countries, share {{a long history of}} {{conservative}} and patriarchal view of marriage and the family structure including marrying at a young age and hypergamy. The pressure from society and family has been the source criticism, shame, social embarrassment and social anxiety for many women who are unmarried. Chen, another women interviewed by the BBC, said the sheng nu are [...] "afraid their friends and neighbours will regard me as abnormal. And <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> <b>would</b> also feel they were totally losing face, when their friends all have grandkids already". Similar sentiment has been shared amongst other women in China, particularly amongst recent university graduates. A report by CNN cited a survey of 900 female university graduates across 17 Chinese universities where approximately 70 percent of those surveyed said [...] "their greatest fear is becoming a 3S lady".|$|E

It was a children's program. And it was just for fun; my parents didn't know I {{was going to play}} professionally, they just wanted me to do something because I had lots of energy. It was only when I started playing well at seven that I went to a professional academy. I would go to school, and then <b>my</b> <b>parents</b> <b>would</b> take me to the club, and I'd {{spend the rest of the}} day there just having fun with the kids." [...] In 1986, Kournikova became a member of the Spartak Tennis Club, coached by Larissa Preobrazhenskaya. In 1989, at the age of eight, Kournikova began appearing in junior tournaments, and by the following year, was attracting attention from tennis scouts across the world. Kournikova signed a management deal at age ten and went to Bradenton, Florida, to train at Nick Bollettieri's celebrated tennis academy.|$|E

[...] That's when Dad showed me José Ferrer as Cyrano de Bergerac; when someone hurls an insult at him, he says, 'Is that all? Ah, no, young sir, you're too simple. [...] You might have said a great many things. [...] Why waste your opportunity?' And then he names a score better than himself. Or Cocteau's La Belle et la Bête (Beauty and the Beast).

Starting off by filming family events like birthdays and holidays, he gradually began producing narrative films with his friends that incorporated stop-motion work and other special effects. Along with enjoying movies, Zemeckis remained an avid TV watcher. [...] "You hear {{so much about the}} problems with television," [...] he said, [...] "but I think that it saved my life." [...] Television gave Zemeckis his first glimpse of a world outside of his blue-collar upbringing; specifically, he learned of the existence of film schools on an episode of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. After seeing Bonnie and Clyde with his father and being heavily influenced by it, Zemeckis decided that {{he wanted to go to}} film school. His parents disapproved of the idea, Zemeckis later said, [...] "But only in the sense that they were concerned... for my [...] family and my friends and the world that I grew up in, this was the kind of dream that really was impossible. <b>My</b> <b>parents</b> <b>would</b> sit there and say, 'Don't you see where you come from?

40|$|Thanks {{must first}} of all go to Dan Hamermesh and Max Stinchcombe, {{both of whom were}} {{integral}} to the completion of this dissertation. Dr. Hamermesh freely offered his expertise on empirical research and on the general processes of writing and researching.

Large tracts of my work deal with matters sociological in nature, I would have navigated these areas much more ineptly without the assistance of Chris Ellison. Though initially he had no idea who I was, he welcomed me to the Sociology Department, and thereafter his door was always open to me. I {{would also like to thank}} Jason Abrevaya and Kripa Freitas for their comments and suggestions. Most importantly, I offer my gratitude to Maritha Indurthy and <b>my</b> <b>parents.</b> I <b>would</b> have lost the hope of ever completing my doctorate long ago if Maritha had not had the confidence in my abilities that I lacked. <b>My</b> <b>parents,</b> Larkin and Nettie, have given their unending support, both financial and emotional, to me in everything that I have undertaken...|$|R
