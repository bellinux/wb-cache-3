Meanwhile, NY45 was reassigned to another highway in Orange County. The portion of former NY45 from Troy to Averill Park became part of NY66 while the remainder became an eastward extension of NY43. The extended NY43 was now concurrent with US9 and US20 along <b>Madison</b> <b>Avenue</b> from Delaware Avenue to Rensselaer, where it followed Broadway and Washington Avenue to US4 in Defreestville. The route continued east to Averill Park on what had been legislative Route21.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of what is}} now NY427 was {{originally}} designated as NY17D in the 1930 renumbering.

NY17D headed west, overlapping NY14 along Water Street to Lake Street, where NY17D turned south and followed Lake Street and Pennsylvania Avenue over the Chemung River to Maple Avenue. Here, NY17D turned to the southeast to follow Maple Avenue through southern Elmira. At Cedar Street, NY17D joined the modern alignment of NY427. From this point east, NY17D followed what is now NY427 to Wyncoop Creek Road in Chemung, where it continued on Wilawana Road to the Pennsylvania border.|$|E

Entrances to Washington Park from Thurlow Terrace and Englewood Place were closed in 1972 turning those into dead end streets from Western Avenue. In 1988 Washington Park Road was renamed Albany Plan of Union Avenue {{in honor of}} the colonial congress held in Albany by Benjamin Franklin that proposed closer ties and support among the Thirteen Colonies. In 1991 Northern Boulevard from its intersection with <b>Madison</b> <b>Avenue</b> and Willett Street north through the park and continuing to Livingston Avenue in Arbor Hill was renamed Henry Johnson Boulevard in honor of African-American World WarI hero Henry Johnson.|$|E

Morgan & Co., was attending a church convention in Richmond, Virginia. Morgan {{was not only the}} city's wealthiest and most well-connected banker, but he had experience with other similar financial crises—he had helped rescue the U.S. Treasury during the Panic of 1893. As news of the crisis gathered, Morgan returned to Wall Street from his convention late on the night of Saturday, October 19. The following morning, the library of Morgan's brownstone at <b>Madison</b> <b>Avenue</b> and 36th St. had become a revolving door of New York City bank and trust company presidents arriving to share information about (and seek help surviving) the impending crisis.|$|E

5|$|Adam Gopnik was {{selected}} to deliver the 2011 Massey Lectures, the annual week-long series of lectures on a political, cultural or philosophical topic given in Canada by a noted scholar. Gopnik was chosen by the panel of representatives from Massey College, House of Anansi Press and the CBC, the organizations responsible for coordinating the lectures. This would be the 50th anniversary of the Massey Lectures and coincide with the 75th anniversary of the CBC. Ideas executive producer Bernie Lucht contacted Gopnik by email to inform him of the panel's decision and {{to ask if he}} would accept. At the time Gopnik was living in New York City, working as a staff writer for The New Yorker magazine. He had previously authored several books on different topics, the most successful being Paris to the Moon, a collection of essays published in 2000.

5|$|An {{extension}} {{of a proposed}} <b>Madison</b> <b>Avenue</b> Line and the IND Sixth Avenue Line operating via 59th Street, with two branches. One branch would have operated along Second Avenue with a branch connecting to the IRT Pelham Line, which {{would have had to}} be modified to fit B Division subway cars, and a branch connecting to the IND Concourse Line. The other branch would have continued under the East River, and would have been connected to the Long Island Rail Road main line in the Sunnyside area. Subway trains would have continued via the Port Washington Branch to Little Neck, and via the LIRR Main Line to Rego Park, where it would have turned via the former Rockaway Beach Branch and then would have turned onto the Lower Montauk Branch, and would have continued on the branch through Jamaica, where it would continue via the Atlantic Branch until Rosedale, staying within city limits. The report claims that its proposed routes would serve up to twice as many people as the NYCTA's proposed routes.|$|E
