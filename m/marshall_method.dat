However, methods based on empirical tests, such as the <b>Marshall</b> <b>method</b> or the Hveem method, {{are known to have}} major drawbacks. It is expected that the volumetric design of bituminous mixtures will replace these methods upgrading bituminous mixture design. In the volumetric design of bituminous mixtures specimens are prepared using the gyratory compactor and their volumetric proprieties are used to determine the optimum binder content. This volumetric design is the core of the first stage, and many times the only stage, of bituminous mixture design in the USA and Australia, for instance.

40|$|The {{achievement}} of a desired level of bituminous mixtures’ performance {{is an important}} issue to increase the durability of pavements and to reduce maintenance costs as well as its impacts. A decisive stage is the mixture design process, in particular the choice of bitumen content to be used. This parameter can affect all the major performance properties of the mixtures. In Portugal, the <b>Marshall</b> <b>method</b> is used for bituminous mixtures design. This is an empirical method which has some drawbacks in the design of non-traditional mixtures as well as some limitations to represent in-service conditions (for example the compaction of the mixtures). Many countries have been using a volumetric design method to overcome these drawbacks. The adoption of a more efficient design methodology can improve the durability of pavements, leading to important costs saving and environmental impact reduction throughout the pavement’s life cycle. However, there is a great experience {{with the use of the}} current mix design methods and the mixture’s in-service performance is thought to be generally adequate in most cases.

The <b>Marshall</b> <b>method</b> is commonly used in Portugal for bituminous mixture design. However, this method has serious drawbacks and a more effective design method is required. The adoption of a volumetric design can contribute to overcome these questions.

It is important to define design values which can simulate the field behaviour of bituminous mixtures.
