30|$|In recent years, oil–water {{separation}} {{has been}} widely researched to reduce the influences of industrial wastewater and offshore oil spills. A filter membrane with special wettability can achieve the separation because of its opposite wettability for water phase and oil phase. In the field of filter membrane with special wettability, porous <b>metal</b> <b>filter</b> membranes have been much investigated because of the associated high efficiency, portability, high plasticity, high thermal stability, and low cost.

40|$|Sintered <b>metal</b> <b>filters</b> {{have been}} used for hot gas {{filtration}} in various plants in the chemical process, petrochemical and power generation industries. These filters can provide particulate capture efficiencies of 99. 9 % or better. The temperature for filtration has been as high as 900 C. Along with filtration efficiency consideration, more important criteria such as corrosion resistance, mechanical strength at service temperature and cake release issues are being addressed. These issues are critical to operating the hot gas filter successfully and cost effectively. Concerns related to hot corrosion and strength at high temperatures lead the technical community towards using ceramic filters. While ceramics are mostly inert to hot corrosion environments, they are brittle, and are prone to failure during thermal cycling or under rapidly changing loads, such as during process upset or filter blowback. <b>Metal</b> <b>filters</b> can be designed with required strength at elevated temperatures, hot corrosion resistance and toughness to withstand the thermal and mechanical stresses. This paper will describe the benefits of using sintered <b>metal</b> <b>filters</b> in corrosive environments at high temperatures and relevant industrial experience in using such filters.

40|$|Ideal filters have a maximised {{open area}} for {{increased}} filtration efficiency, but this can compromise the overall {{strength of the}} filter. Traditionally, <b>metal</b> <b>filters</b> are made from perforated plate, mesh and wedge wire.

This advance in processing for the manufacture of filters also delivers further benefits in filtration efficiency saving end-users energy costs. The combination of three separate parts into a consolidated unit has significantly reduced time and cost of production of wedge wire filters and removed expensive tooling requirements.

30|$|In summary, {{existing}} oil–water separation porous <b>metal</b> <b>filter</b> membranes can utilise {{the special}} wettability of the membrane surface to separate an oil–water mixture and has advantages {{such as high}} efficiency, portability, high plasticity, high thermal stability, good mechanical property and low cost. However, there are some aspects where these filter membranes need improvement for effective treatments of industrial wastewater and offshore crude oil spills. First, the environmental adaptability of the filter membranes needs to be enhanced and its working stability in extreme conditions, such as strong acid and alkali, high-concentration salt solution and corrosive liquid, needs to be strengthened, and its mechanical strength should be improved {{to adapt to the}} real environment. In addition, the material and modification reagents for fabricating the filter membrane need to be eco-friendly during fabrication and application processes. Furthermore, the fabricating process should be simple, and the manufacturing cost should be reasonable {{to meet the needs of}} large-scale production. 3 D printing technology has shown outstanding advantages, such as waste minimization, freedom of design, mass customization and the ability to manufacture complex structures [85]. Biomimetic super-hydrophobic structure [86] and superhydrophobic PLA membrane [87] have been printed for oil-water separation. Those results show that 3 D printing technology made fabrication process of complex micro-nano structure become easier. Based on this technology, oil-water separation membrane with higher efficient can be gotten in the future. Finally, when the oil–water mixture is in an emulsion state, the filter membrane needs to maintain the oil–water separation capability. An oil–water mixed emulsion is generally defined as oil–water dispersion [88] with a droplet diameter of less than 20  μm, and existing studies of oil–water separation by porous <b>metal</b> <b>filter</b> membranes rarely report the separating conditions for a mixed liquid in an emulsion state. Jiang et al. [52] prepared a superhydrophilic–underwater superoleophobic stainless steel mesh that can preliminarily separate oil–water mixed emulsions using a one-step solution coating method with methyltrimethoxysilane, but this filter membrane cannot completely separate oil–water mixture emulsions, since the apertures of many existing oil–water separation porous <b>metal</b> <b>filter</b> membranes are too large. This remains an urgent challenge in the field of oil–water separation by porous <b>metal</b> <b>filter</b> membranes that need to be solved.|$|R
5000|$|The Prefil {{method is}} similar to PoDFA but, in {{addition}} to the metallographic analysis, Prefil provides also an immediate feedback on metal cleanliness from the metal flowrate through the filter. Because everything about the filtration is well controlled (pressure, metal temperature, ...), the only parameter affecting the filtration speed is the inclusion content. One can determine the cleanliness level from the filtration curve (weight of <b>metal</b> <b>filtered</b> as a function of time).|$|R
30|$|Because {{of their}} low cost, high plasticity, high thermal {{stability}} and good mechanical properties, metal materials {{have been well}} studied for use as filter membranes with special wettability for oil–water separation. This special wettability {{can be achieved by}} coating the membranes with metal nets and a porous metal through physical and chemical methods. In 2004, Feng et al. [11] sprayed hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) onto a stainless steel mesh to create a superhydrophobic–superoleophilic filter membrane and reported that this kind of filter membrane was first applied in the oil–water separation field. Subsequently, many porous <b>metal</b> <b>filter</b> membranes with special wettability, fabricated through coating [12], surface oxidation [13] and chemical surface modification [14], were successfully used for oil–water separation. This paper briefly introduces the oil–water separation theory of filter membranes with special wettability and analyses the fabrication, advantages and disadvantages of oil–water separation porous <b>metal</b> <b>filter</b> membranes. The filter membranes are classified into three types according to their properties: filter membranes with superhydrophobic–superolephilic property, with superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic properties and with hydrophilic switchable wettability. In addition, future developments in this field are discussed.|$|R

An equivalent transmission line model is used to fit the transmission and reflection spectra of the <b>metal</b> <b>filters.</b> The transmission line model can characterize well the metal structures with the gap size larger than the near-field decay length.

Although this technology is quite simple, only large-scale production for ceramic molten <b>metal</b> <b>filters</b> are known (Selee, Vesuvius, Shengquan and others).

30|$|The {{mechanism}} of oil–water separation by porous <b>metal</b> <b>filter</b> membranes with special wettability is the superwetting behaviour on the contact interfaces {{of the solid}} phase, water phase, and oil phase [15]. Since there is equilibrium between the oil–water interfacial tension and the permeating power from the intercepted liquid phase, this special filter membrane can achieve a selective separation in an oil–water mixture. Therefore, constructing a superwetting surface is the key process to the fabrication of oil–water separation filter membranes.|$|R

40|$|An {{all-metal}} High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter {{has been}} recently developed {{as an alternative}} to traditional HEPA filters fabricated with conventional glass fibers. This <b>metal</b> <b>filter</b> was developed utilizing sintered porous metal media fabricated from nickel metal powder. One specific application is the potential for replacement of glass fiber HEPA filters currently used in High Level Waste (HLW) tank ventilation systems at various Department of Energy (DOE) nuclear waste storage sites in the US. The glass filters are subject to a shortened life span due to their deterioration from moisture condensation and therefore must be disposed of when spent. The disposal process is costly, creates solid waste, and is hazardous since the site personnel are at risk of exposure to radiation. Savannah River Technology Center (SRTC) began investigating the use of porous metal as a HEPA filter material in 1996. This effort subsequently lead to a DOE funded development. This project, under DOE funding, developed novel technology to replace the glass fiber HEPA filters with a regenerable and more durable filter.
