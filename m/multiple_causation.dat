Biotic filters {{rather than}} abiotic filters should influence the community structure of {{animals such as}} insectivorous bats with life histories characterized by low fecundity. low predation risk. long life expectancy, and stable populations. I investigated the relative influence of biotic filters on various parameters that define bat community structure, based on predictions from competition and coevolution hypotheses. Each of the competing hypotheses was considered {{from a number of}} different perspectives to provide multiple opportunities from which to uncover the mechanism that could result in non-random patterns of community structure. I used a battery of null model and multivariate analyses to test the deterministic or nondeterministic nature of phenotypic, trophic, and species composition patterns of insectivorous bat communities - which I called ensembles. I obtained data for these analyses by sampling the local and regional species richness of insecti vorous bats of southern Africa between 2001 and 2004. Rarefaction and species richness estimators indicated that species inventories of the fynbos, forest, and savanna ensembles, and the Cape Floristic Kingdom regional pool, were complete. As hypothesised, competition and coevolution filters strongly influenced parameters that define bat community structure. My results show that the phenotypic and trophic community structure of insectivorous bats at a local scale exhibit non-random patterns consistent with competition and coevolution hypotheses. Except for an even body size distribution, non-random patterns are not ubiquitous across ensembles. This is linked to <b>multiple</b> <b>causations</b> of competition and coevolution filters operating at a local scale. There was evidence that competition influenced body size distribution across ensembles, and echolocation and dietary patterns in ensembles with high species richness or abundance. At the same time, coevolution filters - mediated by prey defence - strongly influence dietary niche patterns. and to a lesser degree, echolocation patterns. Thus, the non-random phenotypic and trophic patterns of ensembles across southern Africa reflect competition and coevolution filters operating in tandem, or separately, at a local scale. Moreover, abiotic filters such as geographic distribution ranges of small and large-bodied species, extinction risk, and the physics offlight and sound probably also interacted at local and/or regional scales to influence the structure of coexisting bats at a local scale...|$|R

It demonstrates that many scholars who have used the Boolean OR in fact mean XOR, discusses the implications of this confusion and explains the applications of XOR to QCA. Although XOR can be expressed in terms of OR and AND, explicit use of XOR has several advantages: it mirrors natural language closely, extends our understanding of equifinality and deals with mutually exclusive clusters of sufficiency conditions.

40|$|How {{can we make}} {{complexity}} work {{as part of a}} programme of engaged social science? This article {{attempts to}} answer that question by arguing that one {{way to do this is}} through a reconstruction of a central tool of a distinctively social science – the comparative method – understood as a procedure for elucidating the complex and <b>multiple</b> systems of <b>causation</b> that generate particular trajectories towards a desired future from the multiple sets of available futures. The article distinguishes between ‘simplistic complexity’ and ‘complex complexity’. ‘Simplistic complexity’ seeks to explain emergence in complex systems as the product of simple rules and defines complex science as the process of establishing such rules. It can and does serve as the basis of technocratic social engineering in the interest of the powerful. In contrast ‘complex complexity’ recognizes the significance of social structure and willed social agency and does not reduce emergence to the mere working out of a restricted set of rules. Research programmes informed by this second approach must necessarily engage with social actors in context – they must be dialogical. This opens up the possibility of ‘complex complexity’ as a frame of reference for action-research directed towards the transformation of complex social systems. Comparative methods, and in particular Ragin’s qualitative comparative analysis approach, when deployed as part of such a programme, can provide meaningful information about the range of possible futures and the different configurations of causes which might generate particular desired social outcomes. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Nodding syndrome, a {{disabling}} epidemic epileptic encephalopathy, {{has affected}} an estimated 1, 834 children in northern Uganda, with reports {{of as many}} as 3, 000. Etiology is unknown and children are being treated symptomatically but inconsistently with anti-epileptic drugs. Design: This qualitative study comprised 10 semi-structured interviews with caregivers of affected children and five focus group discussions with 23 participants; relatives, teachers, and religious leaders. Data collection and participant observation were carried out from July to September 2012 in Kitgum and Pader districts. The material was coded through inductive thematic analysis. Results: Nodding syndrome has brought signs of discrimination in school admission procedures, founded in a fear of transmission. The suffering and loss caused by nodding syndrome is collective, and participants felt that nodding syndrome was viewed {{as a threat to the}} Acholi only, and that interventions had therefore been delayed. <b>Multiple</b> theories of <b>causation</b> exist, most commonly that the disease is caused by chemicals from bombs or that food aid distributed in IDP camps had expired or been poisoned. A feeling of uncertainty was present in all focus group discussions, fueled by the fact that results of investigations were not being shared with the communities. It was especially agonizing that CDC results had been given to the Ugandan government in 2010 but not to the public. The definitive fear is that the disease will be the end of the Acholi. Conclusions: This study provided insight into the perceptions of communities affected by an unknown emerging disease. Families of affected children are grieving not only their child's illness; it is a loss of social value and of lineage. The loss and suffering involved with nodding syndrome should be seen in the context of the wider suffering of a society disrupted by violent conflict.

The Dura decision itself said little, but counseled lower courts to fashion new requirements of causation and harm modeled upon common law tort principles. These instructions have led lower courts {{to craft a}} series of confusing and inconsistent decisions that incorporate little of the reasoning upon which the common law principles are based. This Article accepts the Dura challenge and examines both common law causation principles and their applicability to federal securities fraud. In so doing, the Article identifies {{the failure of the}} federal courts properly to confront the complex causation challenges presented by securities fraud {{and the extent to which}} common law approaches to <b>multiple</b> and indeterminate <b>causation</b> offer guidance.

The Article goes on to show how, in Basic, the Court shifted the nature of actionable harm and, in so doing, exacerbated the complexity of causation analysis. Defining the appropriate harm involved in securities fraud is challenging. Drawing upon tort law principles, the Article considers several alternatives, ranging from artificial price inflation and ex post stock drop, to increased investment risk. The choice among these alternatives reflects policy judgments about the appropriate goals of private securities fraud litigation.

G. G. Simpson tried to combat this view of paleontology as theoretically inert in his classic work, Tempo and Mode in Evolution (1944), with a brilliant argument that the two subjects of his title fall into a unique paleontological domain and that modes (processes and causes) can be inferred from the quantitative study of tempos (pattern). Nonetheless, Simpson did not cash out his insight to paleontology's theoretical benefit because he followed the strict doctrine of the Modern Synthesis. He studied his domain of potential theory and concluded that no actual theory could be found [...] and that a full account of causes could therefore {{be located in the}} microevolutionary realm after all. I argue that Simpson was unduly pessimistic and that modernism's belief in reductionistic unification (the conventional view of Western intellectuals from the 1920 s to the 1950 s) needs to be supplanted by a postmodernist commitment to pluralism and <b>multiple</b> levels of <b>causation.</b> Macro- and microevolution should not be viewed as opposed, but as truly complementary. I describe the two major domains where a helpful macroevolutionary theory may be sought [...] unsmooth causal boundaries between levels (as illustrated by punctuated equilibrium and mass extinction) and hierarchical expansion of the theory of natural selection to levels both below (gene and cell-line) and above organisms (demes, species, and clades). Problems remain in operationally defining selection at non-organismic levels (emergent traits vs. emergent fitness approaches, for example) and in specifying the nature and basis of levels, but this subject should be the central focus in formulating a more ample and satisfactory general theory of evolution on extended Darwinian principles...|$|R
