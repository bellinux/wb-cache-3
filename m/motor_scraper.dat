50|$|The Terex THS15 Motorscraper was {{a concept}} machine scraper {{displayed}} {{for the first}} time at Minexpo 2000. This machine features some unusual design concepts, including an adjustable cutting edge on the bowl to reduce friction when loading. Other notable features were the rear-mounted drivetrain (there was no engine on the front module) and a hydrostatic transmission, which featured hydraulic wheel motors. At least two prototypes were made, and these featured noticeable differences in front end styling. A digital copy of the brochure for this machine is available through ozebooks. Both the THS15 scrapers were spotted for sale in used machinery dealers by 2011 and their fate is unknown. Terex never went ahead with production and subsequently abandoned <b>motor</b> <b>scraper</b> manufacture altogether.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the {{accuracy}} of stress analysis of blade wheels, one way Fluid-Structure Interaction method was introduced based on the comparisons of existing methods. Finite element analysis software ANSYS along with CFD software FLUENT were comprehensively used for the strength analysis of dual-chamber couplings. According to the simulation results from CFD, the node loads at the interface of pump wheel and the working fluid were obtained and the torque and axial force were predicated. Then the static stress of pump wheel was analyzed with ANSYS. The detail processes were described in this paper. The {{results show that the}} blades of pump wheel is loaded by alternating forces, and the maximum stress, which is 64 MPa, locates at the junction area of the blades and shell. And the coupling analyzed in this study meets the strength requirement. Introducion Hydrodynamic couplings are the most commonly used soft-start equipments for armored face conveyors in mining face. A coupling is arranged between the motor and speed reducer to make the conveyor start up smoothly, protect the <b>motor</b> and <b>scraper</b> chains when overloading occurs and improve the transmission quality. Considering the narrow space and explosive risk under coal mine, the large power coupling used in mining face adopts dual-chamber structure and pure water as th...|$|R
40|$|Robotic Total Stations (RTSs) {{were first}} invented by Geodimeter {{in the year}} 1990. In the recent years, 3 D machine {{guidance}} systems have increased the productivity of construction works. Most machine guidance systems use RTSs with automatic targeting and tracking for position determination. The major applications for machine guidance systems {{can be found in}} construction industry and mining for the guidance of dozers, <b>motor</b> graders, excavators, <b>scrapers</b> as well as in agricultural applications for the guidance of tractors and harvesters. Motorization and automation of the RTSs began a new, faster and more effective way for surveying measurement. Development of the RTSs with automatic searching and tracking opened new possibilities for their utilization in all areas of surveying, especially {{in the area of the}} engineering surveying. RTSs with automatic searching and tracking, offer the possibility to track and order cinematic processes such as movement and deformations of the building structures. Since little information is known about the dynamic accuracy of RTSs in their real-time operation, the aim of this project is to determine the dynamic accuracy and reliability of RTSs. It is vital to test various types of instruments in order to compare the results to the various manufacturers' specification. However, further research and testing will be carried out in the near future in order to obtain the relevant accuracies and reliabilities of the various types of RTSs...|$|R
