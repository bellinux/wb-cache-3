40|$|The {{composition}} of mining waste {{varies according to}} the nature of the mining operation and many other factors, but where the same mineral is extracted from a similar style of metalliferous or industrial mineral deposit or coal, the waste usually has similar characteristics. There are many potential sources of industrial minerals from mining waste. Waste from one mine may be a byproduct or coproduct in a mining operation elsewhere. Much technical research work on mine waste utilization, for example studies on slate waste, has included a manufacturing process. The waste is invariably an inferior material compared with an industrial mineral from a primary resource for the manufacturing process. Successful markets have not been found. Four scenarios are proposed where an industrial <b>mineral</b> <b>product</b> made from mining waste may be marketed successfully. These are a bulk product for a local market made with minimal or no processing; a low unit value product and a cost-effective alternative source of a mineral for local industry; an industrial mineral commodity traded nationally or internationally; and extraction of a high unit value rare mineral. Making an industrial <b>mineral</b> <b>product</b> from mining waste and successfully marketing it should involve minimal processing of the waste consistent with the value of the <b>mineral</b> <b>product.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryKarol E. FikeTrace mineral supplementation is {{necessary}} for proper reproductive success. Little research has evaluated the effect of an injectable trace <b>mineral</b> <b>product,</b> {{in conjunction with a}} dietary mineral supplementation program, on reproduction. This thesis includes two separate studies evaluating the use of an injectable trace <b>mineral</b> <b>product,</b> in addition to a dietary mineral program, on the reproductive success of yearling bulls and heifers. In the first study, we hypothesized that when dietary trace mineral needs are met, administration of an injectable trace <b>mineral</b> <b>product</b> to developing beef bulls would cause a short-term increase in circulating trace mineral concentrations, but not alter semen quality nor ability to pass a breeding soundness examination. Trace mineral treatment did not affect scrotal circumferences and BW of bulls throughout the trial (P [equal to or greater than] 0. 20). Trace Mineral bulls had greater (P [equal to or less than] 0. 0001) trace mineral concentrations at 8 h post-treatment than Control bulls. Semen trace mineral concentrations on d 42 and 91 were similar (P [equal to or greater than] 0. 52) between treatments. Sperm parameters improved (P [equal to or less than] 0. 003) from d 42 to 91, but did not differ (P [equal to or greater than] 0. 06) between treatments. A similar (P = 0. 94) percentage of Trace Mineral (67 %) and Control (68 %) bulls passed a BSE 91 d post-treatment. In the present study, supplemental trace mineral injection was successful at raising circulating trace mineral levels, but did not alter semen trace mineral levels nor improve semen quality. In the second study we hypothesized that when dietary trace mineral needs are met, the use of an injectable trace <b>mineral</b> <b>product</b> in developing heifers would not affect pregnancy rates at single service fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI). Trace Mineral heifers had greater (P = 0. 02) pregnancy rates (51. 28 %) than Control heifers (25. 58 %). The percentage of Trace Mineral (30. 77 %) and Control heifers (47. 50 %) that displayed estrous behavior prior to FTAI as indicated by a red estrous detection patch was not different (P = 0. 13) between treatments. In the present study, despite dietary trace mineral requirements being met, use of an injectable trace mineral injection improved pregnancy rates following FTAI, but did not affect estrous behavior...|$|R
