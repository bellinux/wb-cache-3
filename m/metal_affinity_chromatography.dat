Current methods for phosphopeptide enrichment, e. g., Immobilized <b>Metal</b> ion <b>Affinity</b> <b>Chromatography</b> and titanium dioxide chromatography provide {{varying degrees of}} selectivity and specificity for phosphopeptide enrichment. The number of multi-phosphorylated peptides identified in most published studies is rather low.

50|$|Single-chain {{variable}} fragments {{lack the}} constant Fc region found in complete antibody molecules, and, thus, the common binding sites (e.g., protein G) {{cannot be used}} to purify antibodies. These fragments can often be purified or immobilized using protein L, since protein L interacts with the variable region of kappa light chains. More commonly, scientists incorporate a six histidine tag on the c-terminus of the scFv molecule and purify them using immobilized <b>metal</b> <b>affinity</b> <b>chromatography</b> (IMAC). For unknown reasons, some scFv can also be captured by protein A.|$|E
50|$|Previous {{procedures}} to isolate phosphorylated proteins included radioactive labeling with 32P-labeled ATP followed by SDS {{polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis}} or thin layer chromatography. These traditional methods are inefficient because {{it is impossible to}} obtain large amounts of proteins required for phosphorylation analysis. Therefore, the current and simplest methods to enrich phosphoproteins are affinity purification using phosphospecific antibodies, immobilized <b>metal</b> <b>affinity</b> <b>chromatography</b> (IMAC), strong cation exchange (SCX) chromatography, or titanium dioxide chromatography. Antiphosphotyrosine antibodies have been proven very successful in purification, but fewer reports have been published using antibodies against phosphoserine- or phosphothreonine-containing proteins. IMAC enrichment is based on phosphate affinity for immobilized metal chelated to the resin. SCX separates phosphorylated from non-phosphorylated peptides based on the negatively charged phosphate group. Titanium dioxide chromatography is a newer technique that requires significantly less column preparation time. Many phosphoproteomic studies use a combination of these enrichment strategies to obtain the purest sample possible.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} pursue Haemophilus {{influenza}} carbonic anhydrase (HICA) {{as a potential}} drug target, easy and efficient purification methods must be developed. While immobilized <b>metal</b> <b>affinity</b> <b>chromatography</b> (IMAC) may be used, complications with polyhistidine tags is a concern. Inspired by the endogenous metal affinity of Escherichia coli β-carbonic anhydrase (ECCA), we suggest that the generation of histidine clusters on HICA’s surface will facilitate its purification by <b>metal</b> <b>affinity</b> <b>chromatography</b> without the potential interference of His-tags. Here we investigate the Thr 34 His mutation as a method to generate metal affinity in HICA. Since Thr 34 His is located only 5. 3 Å away from His 32, the two residues make a vicinal histidine pair that can interact with nickel resin. We report successful generation of Thr 34 His HICA mutant plasmid via site-directed mutagenesis. To obtain mutant protein for <b>metal</b> <b>affinity</b> <b>chromatography,</b> Thr 34 His HICA was overexpressed in E. coli cells and isolated as a cell lysate with a concentration of 20. 2 ± 0. 6 mg/mL. <b>Metal</b> <b>affinity</b> <b>chromatography</b> {{was performed on the}} sample, and the chromatography fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in order to assess the metal affinity of the mutant. SDS-PAGE revealed that while Thr 34 His HICA eluted at low 10 mM and 25 mM concentrations of imidazole, 150 mM imidazole was required to fully elute the mutant. These results suggest that through the generation of surface histidine pairs, HICA can be engineered to have metal affinity and thus be easily purified via IMAC...|$|E

40|$|Objective To isolate human {{antibodies}} against hepatitis E {{virus from}} phage display library {{by a new}} method of panning phage antibody library based on immobilized <b>metal</b> <b>affinity</b> <b>chromatography</b> (IMAC). Methods Phage antibody library was allowed to mix with hex-His tagged expressed HEV specific antigen, NE 2, in solution for adequate binding before affinity resin for hex-His was added. The non-specific phage antibodies were removed by extensive washing and the specific bound phage antibodies could then be eluted to infect TG 1 or repeat the binding process for subsequent rounds of purification. The specificity of the selected human antibodies were tested by antigen competitive ELISA, human sera blocking ELISA, scFv expression, and sequence analysis. Results His-NE 2 specific recombinant phages were successfully enriched after panning procedure.
