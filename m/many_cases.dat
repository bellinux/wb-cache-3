5|$|Although this {{definition}} {{can be useful}} for concrete problems, it is far too complicated to produce elegant general proofs; there are too <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> to consider.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Conan Doyle {{said there}} were <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> on record of Home levitating, but skeptics assert the alleged levitations {{occurred}} in darkened conditions susceptible to trickery.|$|E
5|$|In <b>many</b> <b>cases,</b> {{complicated}} limit calculations {{by direct}} application of Newton's difference quotient {{can be avoided}} using differentiation rules. Some {{of the most basic}} rules are the following.|$|E

50|$|Bisphosphonate {{therapy has}} been {{suggested}} as a first-line therapeutic option in <b>many</b> <b>case</b> reports and series.|$|R
5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>cases</b> of croup {{have been}} {{prevented}} by immunization for influenza and diphtheria. At one time, croup referred to a diphtherial disease, but with vaccination, diphtheria is now rare in the developed world.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of neurological symptoms, Kayser–Fleischer rings {{and a low}} ceruloplasmin level is considered sufficient for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. In <b>many</b> <b>cases,</b> however, further tests are needed.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, growing {{scrutiny}} of Leopold's regime {{led to a}} popular campaign movement, centered in the United Kingdom and the United States, to force Leopold to renounce his ownership of the Congo. In <b>many</b> <b>cases,</b> the campaigns based their information on reports from British and Swedish missionaries working in the Congo.|$|E

50|$|However, {{there have}} not been <b>many</b> <b>case</b> studies done with maggot {{debridement}} therapy on animals, therefore, {{it can be difficult}} to assess how successful it is.|$|R
50|$|Because of the {{relative}} rarity of naturally occurring clinical selective amnesia, <b>many</b> <b>case</b> studies have been undertaken {{to learn more about}} the cause and course of the disorder.|$|R
5|$|Greek mythology {{is known}} today {{primarily}} from Greek literature and representations on visual media {{dating from the}} Geometric period from c. 900–800 BC onward. In fact, literary and archaeological sources integrate, sometimes mutually supportive and sometimes in conflict; however, in <b>many</b> <b>cases,</b> {{the existence of this}} corpus of data is a strong indication that many elements of Greek mythology have strong factual and historical roots.|$|E
5|$|However, {{adaptation}} {{to climate change}} has been demonstrated in <b>many</b> <b>cases.</b> These are usually due to a shift in coral and zooxanthellae genotypes. These shifts in allele frequency have progressed toward more tolerant types of zooxanthellae. Scientists found that a certain scleractinian zooxanthella is becoming more common where sea temperature is high. Symbionts able to tolerate warmer water seem to photosynthesise more slowly, implying an evolutionary trade-off.|$|E
5|$|If the solvent {{is water}} {{in either the}} {{evaporation}} or precipitation method of formation, in <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> the ionic crystal formed also includes water of crystallization, so the product {{is known as a}} hydrate, and can have very different chemical properties.|$|E
50|$|Smith, who {{published}} prolifically as J.C. Smith, {{had a long}} association with the Criminal Law Review and wrote <b>many</b> <b>case</b> notes for that journal which were notable for their incisive, playful and amusing analysis.|$|R
5000|$|Goldogrin has {{a complex}} series of mutations. The most {{important}} is called [...] "Grammatical Mutation" [...] (or GM) for it was generalized to a rule and is used in <b>many</b> <b>case</b> not justified purely on phonological grounds.|$|R
50|$|These {{three books}} present a good basic {{introduction}} to social network analysis. Scott {{is the most}} general and most recent. Wasserman and Faust presents thorough methodological coverage. Wellman and Berkowitz is the most readable, theoretical and provides <b>many</b> <b>case</b> studies.|$|R
5|$|Improvements on the {{diagnosis}} of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in life were made {{with the introduction of}} venography in 1951, which also aided in the distinction from idiopathic intracranial hypertension, which has similar presenting signs and symptoms in <b>many</b> <b>cases.</b>|$|E
5|$|In <b>many</b> <b>cases,</b> {{families}} {{left some}} members {{behind in the}} hope that they would retain land for the family, while there were reports that a minority of Catholics with links to the communists decided to stay willingly.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo's notes {{appear to}} have been {{intended}} for publication because many of the sheets have a form and order that would facilitate this. In <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> a single topic, for example, the heart or the human fetus, is covered in detail in both words and pictures on a single sheet. Why they were not published during Leonardo's lifetime is unknown.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, car {{dealership}} had small window front showrooms. Later, most {{car dealership}}s converted to large parking lot-based stores with integrated parts and service departments. In <b>many</b> <b>case,</b> an auto row is a vehicle-themed historic district {{rather than a}} current location to purchase cars.|$|R
5000|$|Historically, {{frame grabber}} {{expansion}} cards were the predominant way to interface cameras to PC's. Other interface methods have emerged since then, with frame grabbers (and in <b>many</b> <b>case,</b> cameras themselves) connecting to computers via interfaces such as USB, Ethernet and IEEE 1394 ("FireWire").|$|R
50|$|The Molecular Conceptor Learning Series {{presents}} the fundamental topics surrounding computer-aided drug design from basic principles to more in-depth examination and using interactive 3D technology, practical examples and <b>many</b> <b>case</b> studies, the concepts, methodologies and techniques used in drug discovery {{are brought to}} life.|$|R
5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>cases</b> of croup are {{preventable}} by immunization for influenza and diphtheria. Croup {{is usually}} {{treated with a}} single dose of steroids by mouth. In more severe cases inhaled epinephrine may also be used. Hospitalization is required in one to five percent of cases.|$|E
5|$|<b>Many</b> <b>cases</b> of {{hypothyroidism}} {{are associated}} with mild elevations in creatine kinase and liver enzymes in the blood. They typically return to normal when hypothyroidism has been fully treated. Levels of cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and lipoprotein (a) can be elevated; the impact of subclinical hypothyroidism on lipid parameters is less well-defined.|$|E
5|$|Misdiagnosis is {{frequent}} (occurring {{in about}} 5 to 30% of cases). Different {{studies showed that}} in <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> seizure-like attacks in apparent treatment-resistant epilepsy have a cardiovascular cause. Approximately 20% of the people seen at epilepsy clinics have PNES and {{of those who have}} PNES about 10% also have epilepsy; separating the two based on the seizure episode alone without further testing is often difficult.|$|E
50|$|The {{cycle of}} joints swellings have been {{reported}} as being very regular, even predictable. This has been a characteristic feature of IH in <b>many</b> <b>case</b> reports. However, over the longer-term especially, these cycles of effusion and recovery {{may not be as}} constant as first reported.|$|R

50|$|Because of the {{rarity of}} these tumors, {{there is still}} a lot of unknown information. There are <b>many</b> <b>case</b> studies that have been {{reported}} on patients who have been diagnosed with this specific type of tumor. Most of the above information comes from the findings resulting from case studies.|$|R
5|$|Non-CCD winter losses {{as high as}} 50% have {{occurred}} in some years and regions (e.g., 2000–2001 in Pennsylvania). Normal winter losses are typically {{in the range of}} 15–25%. In <b>many</b> <b>cases,</b> beekeepers reporting significant losses of bees did not experience true CCD, but losses due to other causes.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the solar}} park has been commissioned, the owner usually enters into a {{contract}} with a suitable counterparty to undertake operation and maintenance (O). In <b>many</b> <b>cases</b> this may be fulfilled by the original EPC contractor.|$|E
5|$|Roads {{offered the}} enemy fast routes to their {{objectives}} and consequently they were blocked at strategic points. Many of the road-blocks formed by Ironside were semi-permanent. In <b>many</b> <b>cases,</b> Brooke had these removed altogether, as experience had shown {{they could be}} {{as much of an}} impediment to friends as to foes. Brooke favoured removable blocks.|$|E
