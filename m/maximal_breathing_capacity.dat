40|$|AbstractBackgroundTo {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} inhaled beta-agonists on sub-maximal and <b>maximal</b> exercise <b>capacity,</b> <b>breathing</b> pattern, dyspnoea, leg-discomfort and spirometry in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). ObjectivesEight patients performed two maximal incremental cycle-ergometry tests on separate days with inhaled placebo or salbutamol (600 μg) administered before each test in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial. Primary outcomes were exercise duration (Exdur) in seconds (s) and maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2 max) in litres/minute (L/min). Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) was measured immediately pre-inhaler, post-inhaler and post-exercise. Dyspnoea and leg-discomfort were assessed post-exercise. ResultsWithin-day FEV 1 comparisons demonstrated that the placebo test day FEV 1 improved significantly post-exercise (0. 11 L, p< 0. 05) and the salbutamol test day FEV 1 improved significantly post-inhaler (0. 22 L, p< 0. 001) and post-exercise (0. 07 L, p< 0. 01). Between-day FEV 1 comparisons demonstrated significant improvements in post-inhaler (0. 17 L, p< 0. 05) and post-exercise (0. 13 L, p< 0. 05) FEV 1 following salbutamol. Sub-maximal and maximal exercise showed no significant difference as shown by Exdur (547 ± 154 s vs. 529 ± 127 s) and VO 2 max (1. 9 ± 0. 5 L/min vs. 1. 9 ± 0. 6 L/min). No significant change in breathing pattern, dyspnoea or leg-discomfort was detected. The study had a power of 92 % to detect a 10 % improvement in Exdur.

Both the pulmonary arterial pressure and the total pulmonary vascular resistance were either normal or slightly increased with a few showing {{a high degree of}} increase in them, but there was a correlation between the two; and also the crosss-sectional area of the ductus arteriosus was correlated to both the pulmonary blood-flow and the mean pulmonary arterial pressure, with exception of cases where total pulmonary vascular resistance was markedly elevated. 2. A correlation could be recognized between the pulmonary blood-flow ratio and the shunt-flow ratio, and the shunt-flow was mostly directed from left to right. 3. In cases where the cross-sectional area of the ductus was over 0. 5 cm 2, many of them were clinically in advanced stage, and this area of the cross-section together with the total pulmonary vascular resistance were the important factors controlling the cardiac functions of this disease. 4. The ventricular works tended to increase in both the right and left, and the hypertrophy of the both ventricles observable in electrocardiogram is indicative of the condition gradually leading to cardiac failure. Pulmonary Functions Observations were carried mainly on pulmonary circulation and ventilation. 1. Minnte ventilation volume was either normal or slightly inccreased. In cases, with pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary blood-flow of over 10 l/min., shunt-flow of over 5 l/min., or with cross-sectional area of the ductus of over 0. 5 c㎡, the minute ventilation volume was incresed. 2. <b>Maximal</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>capacity</b> was either normal or mildly decreased. There was an inverse correlation between the <b>maximal</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>capacity</b> ratio and pulmonary arterial pressure in the case either with pulmonary hypertension or with an increased area of cross-section of the ductus. 3.

40|$|I N {{recent years}} {{there have been}} several reports on the {{relation}} of obesity and polycythemia. In 1951 Newman, Feltman and Devlin * reported a small series of cases of supposed polycythemia vera with impairment of pulmonary function. Their case 4 was a very obese, somnolent patient with an arterial oxygen saturation of 69 % and a <b>maximal</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>capacity</b> of 48 % of predicted normal. Al-though the hemoglobin was 23 gm., the red blood cell count 7, 500, 000, and the hematocrit 67 %, the white blood cell count was only 6, 550 and the platelet count 305, 510. This is not the usual picture of polycythemia vera. It is likely that this represented a case of polycythemia due to or associated with obesity, rather than polycythemia vera. Ratto, Briscoe, Morton and Comroe 2 in 1955 discussed the relation of anoxia and polycythemia.

40|$|Studying {{the cardiac}} {{functions}} in 11 patients and the pulmonary functions in 10 patients, with tetralogy of Fallot, the author obtained the following results. Cardiac Functions 1, The {{rise in the}} right ventricular pressure was more marked than that in the pulmonary arterial pressure and the systolic pressure of right ventricle more or less coincided with the systemic pressure. 2. Arterial oxygen saturation dropped down to 85 - 56 per cent and cases showing saturation below 70 per cent were clinically severe. The effective pulmonary blood-flow was 2, 017 cc/min., and those showing under 2, 000 cc/min. were all severe cases. Arterial oxygen desaturation and decreased effective pulmonary blood-flow {{were likely to be}} the most important factors evaluating the cardiac functions in this disease, and there was a correlation between the two. 3. Atrial septal defects were encountered in 6 patients out of 11. 4. Although the value above the normal level was maintained in the systemic blood-flow, it had no correlation with the effective pulmonary blood-flow. 5. In electrocardiogram incomplete right bundle branch block was revealed in the majority of the patients, and the right axis deviation or right hypertrophy were observed in almost half of the patients. 5. The average of right ventricular work was 4. 85 kg. m/min. /m 2, and that of the left ventricular work 2. 33 kg. m. /min. /m 2; and an increase in the right ventricular work and a decrease in the left ventricular work were observed; namely, the right ventricular work was twice as much as the left. Pulmonary Functions 1. A marked decrease was observed in the volume of carbon dioxide in expired air, and this was due to hyperventilation. There was a positive correlation between arterial oxygen saturation and effective pulmonary blood-flow. 2. The increase in minute ventilation volume was more marked than that in acyanotic diseases. 3. A decrease in <b>maximal</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>capacity</b> ratio was observed; and <b>maximal</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>capacity</b> ratio was correlated to both arterial oxygen saturation and effective pulmonary blood-flow. 4.

40|$|Changes in organ {{function}} {{from birth to}} old age were investigated from published data. In essence, the observations of Shock and colleagues on <b>maximal</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>capacity,</b> vital capacity, glomerular filtra-tion rate, renal plasma flow, basal metabolic rate (BMR), ulnar nerve conduction velocity, cardiac index, and intracellular water (ICW) for the age period 30 to 85 years were extended {{to the time of}} birth. There were two principal findings. First, with the exception of BMR and ICW, these functional indices increased from a low point at birth to a maximum between 3 and 20 years of age and then after 30 years declined progressively to 85 years; BMR declined from a maximum in infancy and ICW peaked at about 30 years and then declined. Second, the coefficient of variation increased regularly from birth to old age. Because the peak of {{organ function}} coincided with the period of minimal mortality, the curve of organ function across the life sequence was considered to represent changes in adaptive capacity. Supporting evidence from studies of physical fitness, thermoregulation, and seasonal change of mortality was considered.

The atrial pressure was normal. 2. The total pulmonary vascular resistance and the pulmonary arteriolar resistancc showed a slight increase, {{but there were some}} who showed a marked rise. 3. The ventricular work was normal in the left, but was increased in the right ventricle in all. In the case with marked pulmonary hypertension the ratio of ventricular work was in an inverse proportion and indicated a greater load on the right ventricle. 4. All these showing the cross-sectional area of atrial septal defect of over 5. 0 c㎡ were severe cases. The area of cross-section of septal defect was correlated to both shunt-flow and pulmonary blood-flow; and likewise there was a correlation between the pnlmonary arterial presture and the pulmonary vascular resistance.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the mechanism of dyspnoea in hyperthyroidism measurements of spirometry, lung volume, transfer factor for carbon monoxide and its subdivisions, maximal respiratory pressures, methacholine challenge, arterial blood gases were made and exercise studies performed on 16 patients before treatment for hyperthyroidism. Methacholine challenge showed that only three of 14 patients increased airway reactivity, which was mild. Maximal pressures which could be generated by the respiratory muscles were reduced in some patients, as was functional residual capacity. Exercise ventilation and breathing frequency were increased and the respiratory exchange ratio was abnormally high. Anaerobic threshold was measured in nine of 15 subjects and was below normal in each case. All but two subjects stopped exercise because of dyspnoea, and the maximum oxygen uptake achieved by the group was 53 per cent (/i= 15, range 26 - 66 per cent) of predicted maximum oxygen consumption. The maximum ventilation averaged only 43 per cent (n= 15, range 16 - 96 per cent) of the <b>maximal</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>capacity</b> predicted from spirometric tests. Nine patients were studied shortly after being rendered euthyroid by treatment. At rest, only maximal respiratory pressures increased significantly. On exercise, the maximal workload attained and the ventilation achieved increased significantly. Breathing patterns, maximal oxygen consumption, ventilation, anaerobic threshold and cardiac frequency remained unchanged. We conclude that: patients with hyperthyroidism do not generally have increased airway reactivity; when hyperthyroid, respiratory muscles are weak, and improve following treatment; exercise capacity is impaired in hyperthyroid patients probably because {{of a combination of}} an inefficiently rapid and shallow breathing pattern, an increase of anaerobic metabolism and discomfort associated with the act of breathing.

Physique (body weight and skinfold thickness), maximum oxygen intake, maximum oxygen debt and hematological findings [hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum total protein and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (hemoglobin/ hematocrit× 100) ] were measured in December 1978, May 1979 and December 1979 so as to see the effects of training. The subjects were 6 regular members ranging in age from 19. 1 to 23. 5. The results were as follows. 1. Physique was superior to the mean of the Japanese in the same age bracket by approximately 10 cm and 10 kg in body height and weight respectively. However, it was inferior to the mean of the six teams of the Japan Industrial Basketball League by 2 - 5 cm in body height and 1 - 4 kg in body weight. Skinfold thickness (triceps and scapula) was approximately 10 mm thiner than the mean of the Japanese. Body fat rate was close to 17. 5 % which is the functionally ideal value. All of the body weight, skinfold thickness and body fat rate were lowest in May 1979 but were recovered in December 1979 when it was the game season. 2. The <b>maximal</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>capacity,</b> maximum oxygen intake, oxygen pulse and maximum oxygen debt increased in December 1979 compared with the values in December 1978. The scores in these subjects were much higher than in average Japanese females, and also greater than in middle-distance runners. The increase of both maximum oxygen intake and maximum oxygen debt from December 1978 to December 1979 was approximately 18 %. 3. Hemoglobin, hematocrit and serum total protein in December 1978 were in the lowest limit of normal range, tended to be anemic in May 1979 and recovered normal level in December 1979 by the improvement of diet. The mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration was within normal limits in May 1979 when anemic symptons were recognized. Thus a sort of defensive reaction was observed in hematological indices. The above results indicated that considerable effects in respiratory and circulatory systems were induced by systematic training for one year.

50|$|Cooper himself defines aerobic {{exercise}} {{as the ability}} to utilise the maximum amount of oxygen during exhaustive work. Cooper describes some of the major health benefits of {{aerobic exercise}}, such as gaining more efficient lungs by maximising <b>breathing</b> <b>capacity,</b> thereby increasing ability to ventilate more air in a shorter period of time. As <b>breathing</b> <b>capacity</b> increases, one is able to extract oxygen more quickly into the blood stream, increasing elimination of carbon dioxide. With aerobic exercise the heart becomes more efficient at functioning, and blood volume, hemoglobin and red blood cells increase, enhancing the ability of the body to transport oxygen from the lungs into the blood and muscles. Metabolism will change and enable consumption of more calories without putting on weight. Aerobic exercise can delay osteoporosis as there is an increase in muscle mass, a loss of fat and an increase in bone density. With these variables increasing, there is a decrease in likelihood of diabetes as muscles use sugars better than fat. One of the major benefits of aerobic exercise is that body weight may decrease slowly; it will only decrease at a rapid pace if there is a calorie restriction, therefore reducing obesity rates.|$|R

With SMVV subjects sustained on average 68 % of the predicted maximum <b>breathing</b> <b>capacity</b> and achieved final lactate concentrations of 1 · 9 mmol/l (17 · 1 mg/ 100 ml), representing an average increase of about 1 · 0 mmol/l (9 · 0 mg/ 100 ml) over resting values. There was a wide range between individuals, from no increase at all to 2 · 7 mmol/l, despite similar levels of ventilation.

40|$|For {{many years}} the maximum <b>breathing</b> <b>capacity</b> (M. B. C.) {{has been used}} as a test of the {{mechanical}} function of the lungs. It is most commonly per-formed with a spirometer, which provides a per-manent record of the subject's performance. Un-fortunately, much of the earlier experimental work suffered from two defects. (a) No control experi-ments were made to investigate the fidelity with which the spirometer recorded the tidal air of the subject at high respiratory rates, and (b) the rate of breathing was seldom recorded. It has been shown (D'Silva and Mendel, 1950; Bernstein and Mendel, 1951; Bernstein, D'Silva, and Mendel, 1952) that both the above factors should be taken into account when measurement...|$|R
40|$|The work {{of moving}} the lung, chest wall, {{diaphragm}} and abdominal contents during spontaneous respiration is performed by the muscles of respiration. In order to obtain {{a better understanding of}} the disability present in pulmonary disease it would be advantageous to have, in normal and diseased states, a measure of the total work being done, the energy cost of performing this work and the efficiency of the muscles of respiration. There are few measurements of total mechanical work and efficiency of the respiratory muscles in the literature (1). A simple method for the determination of the oxygen consumption and efficiency of the respiratory muscles, as well as an indirect measurement of the total mechanical work, has recently been described (2). Reproducible results were obtained in both a normal and an emphysematous subject intensively studied. The purpose of this paper is to report further data on the oxygen cost, efficiency and the total mechanical work of the respiratory process in a series of normal and emphysematous subjects. METHODS Subjects. Table I lists the physical characteristics of the 16 normal and 22 emphysematous subjects studied. The normal subjects had no clinical or radiological evidence of cardio-respiratory disease. The diagnosis of pulmonary emphysema was based on the clinical history and examination, and on the radiological and spirographic evidence. Vital <b>capacities</b> and maximum <b>breathing</b> <b>capacities</b> were measured on a Collins respirometer with valves and carbon dioxide absorber removed. The maximum of at least four determinations was chosen. All patients with emphysema showed marked obstruction to expiratory outflow and reduction of the maximum <b>breathing</b> <b>capacity.</b> Oxygen consumption of the respiratory muscles. The oxygen consumption was determined at rest and at sev...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} ability of {{pulmonary}} function {{and the relationship between}} the degrees of hearing defect and <b>breathing</b> <b>capacities,</b> we measured the flow-volume curves of 32 deaf children in middle school for the deaf, and of 88 normal children in junior high school with the use of flow volume reader manufactured with Nihonkoden's MFR- 8100. And we also investigated the height of all subjects and the values of hearing loss in deaf children. After that, we treated the obtained data statistically. The results are summarized as follows: (1) The correlation coefficient between <b>breathing</b> <b>capacities</b> of deaf children and their heights was r= 0. 798 in school boys, and r= 0. 837 in school girls. (2) The average capacity of lungs of the children from the 1 grade to the 3 grade in lower secondary school was 3. 11 l in male, 2. 58 l in female in the study area, and 3. 04 l in male, 2. 43 l in female in the control area. (3) The itsms of the breathing function test were VC, %VC, FVC, FVC 1. 0, FEV 1. 0, FEV 1. 0 %, Index, V 75 /HT, V 50 /HT, V 25 /HT, V 10 /HT, V 50 /V 25, &V 25 /V 10, and they are not significantly for the two areas in both sexes, but except V 75 /HT in female was higher in the study area than in the control areas.

40|$|Forty-nine {{adults who}} had {{undergone}} cardiopulmonary bypass surgery {{were randomly assigned to}} one of three exercise programs to determine if either <b>maximal</b> inspiratory <b>breathing</b> exercises or incentive spirometry offered a ther apeutic advantage over early mobilization alone. After extubation, the patients started their assigned exercise programs. A physical examination and pulmonary function tests were performed preoperatively, at the start of the exercise pro gram, and 24 and 48 hours after the start of the program. The results showed a significant decrease (approximately 50 %) in lung volumes but no airflow obstruc tion in patients who had coronary artery bypass graft. In those patients who had valve replacement, lung volumes fell, and in addition, mild airflow obstruction occurred. A majority of patients had postoperative pulmonary complications. There were no significant differences among the exercise programs in improving lung volumes and airflow or in preventing postoperative complications.

40|$|A five-year {{follow-up}} of ventilatory capacity in over 95 % of {{a random sample}} of men living in the Rhondda Fach has been carried out. Miners and ex-miners with and without simple pneumoconiosis have been compared with non-mining controls, and the effect of ageing, mining, dust exposure, and tobacco smoking has been assessed. The change in Indirect Maximum <b>Breathing</b> <b>Capacity</b> (I. M. B.

An average decline of 1 · 865 ± 0 · 274 litres per minute each year in the I. M. B.
