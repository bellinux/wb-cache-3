40|$|Subnanosecond {{emission}} phenomena {{have been}} studied at a modified 1 kJ Mather type plasma focus device. High energy particle beams, nonthermal infrared and microwave emission as well as anisotropic soft x-rays are observed. In the plasma a hydrodynamic instability leads to a final radius of r around 50 My m and a length of 1 = 500 <b>My</b> m <b>through</b> <b>which</b> a current of I = 200 kA is driven. Induced by the high power density, microinstabilities modulate the plasma density periodically. Due to particle-wave interaction, electrons and ions are accelerated to energies beyond 1 MeV. The electron beam is emitted in pulses with a pulse period of about 10 - 30 ps and a pulse width {{in the range of}} 1 - 3 ps. Simultaneously, anisotropic emission of soft x-rays at a wavelength of about Lambda = 1 nm into a cone with a half angle Theta = o. 2 rad is observed. The relative line width Delta lambda/Lambda = 2. 10 high - 3, indicates a temporal coherent emission of x-radiation by the fully ionized hydrogen plas ma. Assuming an FEL-like process as generation mechanism of the soft x-rays, the period length of the density structure and the relativistic factor Gamma of the electron beam are determined as Lambda about 17 nm and Gamma about 3. The observed phenomena in the plasma can be theoretically described as a selforganization process in terms of a three-wave-coupling model of a beam-plasma system...|$|R

60|$|Having reeved {{the line}} {{through all the}} {{inferior}} blocks, I went out with {{it to the end}} of the weather-top-gallant-yard-arm, and was in the act of leaning over and passing it through the suspended jewel-block there, when the ship gave a plunge in the sudden swells of the calm sea, and pitching me still further over the yard, threw the heavy skirts of my jacket right over my head, completely muffling me. Somehow I thought it was the sail that had flapped, and, under that impression, threw up my hands to drag it from my head, relying upon the sail itself to support me meanwhile. Just then the ship gave another sudden jerk, and, head-foremost, I pitched from the yard. I knew where I was, from the rush of the air by my ears, but all else was a nightmare. A bloody film was before <b>my</b> eyes, <b>through</b> <b>which,</b> ghost-like, passed and repassed my father, mother, and sisters. An utterable nausea oppressed me; I was conscious of gasping; there seemed no breath in my body. It was over one hundred feet that I fell--down, down, with lungs collapsed as in death. Ten thousand pounds of shot seemed tied to my head, as the irresistible law of gravitation dragged me, head foremost and straight as a die, toward the infallible centre of this terraqueous globe. All I had seen, and read, and heard, and all I had thought and felt in my life, seemed intensified in one fixed idea in my soul. But dense as this idea was, it was made up of atoms. Having fallen from the projecting yard-arm end, I was conscious of a collected satisfaction in feeling, that I should not be dashed on the deck, but would sink into the speechless profound of the sea.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} {{wearables}} are inextricably performative. By this I mean that performance—human and nonhuman performance {{such as those}} encountered {{both on and off}} stage, as well as social performance and the performance of fashion and technology—contribute to the creation and meaning of wearables. With this aim in view, the thesis explores performance from four research angles: a framing of the birth of wearables in a performative context; a theoretical analysis of wearables as somatically, aesthetically, and technologically constituted via the performative; a historical back-dating of pre-computational wearables stemming from Modernist performative fields; and the in-situ case studies of contemporary wearables creations. It is my goal to demonstrate that wearables are performative across transversal timelines, materials, styles, fabrication processes, and body expressions. Using references from the art-research labs currently involved in developing fashion-tech and wearables—as an important counterbalance to industry’s contributions to wearables—I ask this central question: how can concepts of performance elucidate wearables? I look toward performance as a key thread that follows wearables’ beginnings to the current, contemporary technological culture embedded in media arts and experimental contributions to the field. Why? Because wearables are {{more than the sum of}} the technologies they incorporate, they are the result of their admixtures of fashion, bodies, display, and transformation (in both human and technological form). In short, wearables are active, (a) live, and hence both the objects themselves and the individuals wearing them participate in the co-creation of their performance. Performance is complex—striding as it does across disciplines from the technological and engineering; to the human and unscripted—and for this reason it is richly suited to the challenges encountered when describing wearables. Performance is the key pathway, in <b>my</b> opinion, <b>through</b> <b>which</b> we can gain stronger insight into the stakes, meanings, messiness, desires, and technological innovations that are being developed in wearables in artistic labs past, present and future...|$|R
