5000|$|July 2005 - Jerry has {{finished}} the <b>male</b> <b>mold</b> {{and sent it}} to the glass shop to build the production tooling.|$|E
50|$|The {{parallel}} profile {{system was}} developed from cold molded (double diagonal) boat building, and uses {{at least four}} layers of material laminated over a <b>male</b> <b>mold</b> into a curved blank, including enough wood for rails, which are then shaped.|$|E
50|$|This {{style of}} {{construction}} was further developed in Germany by LFG Roland using the patented Wickelrumpf (wrapped body) form later licensed by them to Pfalz Flugzeugwerke who used it on several fighter aircraft. Each {{half of the}} fuselage shell was formed over a <b>male</b> <b>mold</b> using two layers of plywood strips with fabric wrapping between them. The early plywood used was prone to damage from moisture and delamination.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment {{is to provide a}} simple, inexpensive composite fabrication technique which can be easily performed with a minimum of equipment and facilities. This process eliminates expensive female molds and uses only <b>male</b> <b>molds</b> which are easily formed from foam blocks. Once the mold is shaped, it is covered with fiberglass and becomes a structural component of the product...|$|R

5000|$|A rigid {{structure}} is usually {{used to establish}} the shape of FRP components. Parts can be laid up {{on a flat surface}} referred to as a [...] "caul plate" [...] or on a cylindrical structure referred to as a [...] "mandrel". However most fibre-reinforced plastic parts are created with a mold or [...] "tool." [...] Molds can be concave female <b>molds,</b> <b>male</b> <b>molds,</b> or the mold can completely enclose the part with a top and bottom mold.|$|R
50|$|This {{process is}} related to vacuum bag molding {{in exactly the same}} way as it sounds. A solid female mold is used along with a {{flexible}} <b>male</b> <b>mold.</b> The reinforcement is placed inside the female mold with just enough resin to allow the fabric to stick in place (wet lay up). A measured amount of resin is then liberally brushed indiscriminately into the mold and the mold is then clamped to a machine that contains the male flexible mold. The flexible male membrane is then inflated with heated compressed air or possibly steam. The female mold can also be heated. Excess resin is forced out along with trapped air. This process is extensively used in the production of composite helmets due to the lower cost of unskilled labor. Cycle times for a helmet bag moulding machine vary from 20 to 45 minutes, but the finished shells require no further curing if the molds are heated.|$|E
50|$|A {{graphite}} coated blank {{is placed}} into a heated press. Air pressure {{is used to}} force the metal into a bubble shape before the <b>male</b> <b>mold</b> is pushed into {{the underside of the}} bubble to make an initial impression. Air pressure is then used from the other direction to final form the metal around the male mould. This process has long cycle times because the superplastic strain rates are low. Product also suffers from poor creep performance due to the small grain sizes and there can be cavitation porosity in some alloys. Surface texture is generally good however. With dedicated tooling, dies and machines are costly. The main advantage of the process is that {{it can be used to}} produce large complex components in one operation. This can be useful for keeping the mass down and avoiding the need for assembly work, a particular advantage for aerospace products. For example, the diaphragm-forming method (DFM) can be used to reduce the tensile flow stress generated in a specific alloy matrix composite during deformation.|$|E
40|$|Freestanding shells {{produced}} for experimental aerodynamic-heating tests. Heat transfer shells require several steps and several precise molds. First, interlocking aluminum {{male and female}} molds fabricated. Holes for thermocouples drilled through <b>male</b> <b>mold</b> at desired locations. Wires having same diameter as thermocouple wire placed through holes in <b>male</b> <b>mold</b> flush to female mold. Epoxy exposed to vacuum to remove air bubbles poured {{between male and female}} molds to form thin female mold. Once mold cured, wires removed and aluminum molds separated...|$|E
50|$|The 1992 Americas Cup {{brought a}} major shake {{up to the}} {{sailboat}} mast industry as it was known. It {{was the first time}} in long history of the sport that Carbon Fiber was allowed to be used in the production of the masts. Realizing this as a great opportunity, Offshore Spars teamed up with Bill Koch’s America Cubed syndicate as the primary mast supplier. Having no composite experience, production machinery, or tooling this switch in manufacturing materials brought some major challenges to both Offshore Spars and the America Cubed syndicate. To help tackle these challenges the duo teamed up with Hercules Aerospace who had been well versed in composite manufacturing for many years. Through that collaboration the Offshore Spars process of <b>Male</b> <b>Molded,</b> Autoclave Cured carbon sailboat spars was born. With the Americas cup spars being the first carbon spars the company produced the Autoclave curing of the masts had to be outsourced. After seeing that process and the quality of the mast section it produced, Offshore Spars quickly invested in the technology and purchased a 70 ft Autoclave of their own; which at the time was the longest Autoclave in the United States. Since the purchase of the Autoclave Offshore Spars has invested heavily in the <b>male</b> <b>molded</b> composite production process with in house designed tooling, mandrel turning stations, and de-bulk tape wrapping machines. Staying apprised to composite manufacturing process in an effort to build on the companies existing knowledge ensures that Offshore Spars is always at the forefront of composite spar construction.|$|R
50|$|A quicker method uses a {{compression}} mold. This is a two-piece (<b>male</b> and female) <b>mold</b> {{usually made}} out of aluminum or steel that is pressed together with the fabric and resin between the two. The benefit is {{the speed of the}} entire process. Some car manufacturers, such as BMW, claimed to be able to cycle a new part every 80 seconds. However, this technique has a very high initial cost since the molds require CNC machining of very high precision.|$|R
500|$|Callie {{inherited}} the mutation for {{a gene that}} causes 5-alpha-reductase deficiency, which impedes the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. While the former hormone causes the brain to become masculine, it is the latter that <b>molds</b> <b>male</b> genitals. When Callie reaches puberty, her testosterone levels increase significantly, resulting {{in the formation of}} a larger Adam's apple, the broadening of her muscles, the deepening of her voice, and the augmentation of her clitoris to resemble a penis. Doctors determine that Callie has the XY chromosomes of a male after inspecting Callie's genitalia. Callie's parents bring her to New York City to see Dr. Peter Luce, a foremost expert on hermaphroditism, who believes she should retain her female identity. Luce plans a gender reassignment surgery to make her a female. However, Callie knows that she is sexually attracted to females, and decides to run away to pursue a male identity. When Cal has a sexual relationship with the Japanese-American photographer Julie {{at the end of the}} book, he is able to love [...] "without the need to penetrate the object of his desire".|$|R
40|$|In {{the rapidly}} {{expanding}} wind energy market, manufacturing processes of composite components must be continually improved {{to keep up}} with high demand and increasing part size. This research focuses on improving the offline production of the root section of wind turbine blades. In this research, a system is developed and tested to replace the two-part manual layup of the prefabricated root with an automated fabric winding machine. The system is designed to wind a limited number of long, stitched plies semi-helically around a <b>male</b> <b>mold</b> at a lower cost and higher quality than current processes. A prototype machine is created that pulls two types of Non-Crimp Fabric from supply rolls onto a rotating mandrel that matches the interior surface of a scaled down blade root. The prototype system proves Non-Crimp Fabric plies can be wound and a <b>male</b> <b>mold</b> {{can be used as a}} suitable replacement for a female mold by creating several successful prototype root sections. Process times and labor costs between the current manual layup and the winding method are also compared and show a significant reduction in glass layup, further proving the feasibility of the new system...|$|E
40|$|It was {{possible}} to build sections of first surface glass mirrors of 30 x 60 cm with parabolic trough profiles {{in order to get}} a kind of mosaics. Using these mosaic segments, it {{was possible}} to get a parabolic trough concentrator with an aperture of 2. 37 m and 1. 14 m long. Using the following methodology {{was possible to}} get such concentrator. A <b>male</b> <b>mold</b> with parabolic trough geometry previously fabricated with stainless steel sheet described by Almanza et al. 1982, was used to get small segments of mass-rock¨, a mexican material which is a combination of pozzolan, synthetical and natural microfibers, and cementitions materials. When such material is hydrated, its behavior has a very easy molding behavior. Mass-rock segments (female) were built over the <b>male</b> <b>mold.</b> Along the hardening of this material, no deformation was detected and such material works up to 800 C almost without any deformation. Float soda-lime glass was used as substrate and the trough glass segments were fabricated by thermally sagged method up to 600 C over the female mass-rock ¨ molds. To this temperature, the glass can get the parabolic geometry and conserve its smoothness when they are inside the oven between 20 and 60 minutes, depending on the number of glasse...|$|E
40|$|The Thermal Spray Laboratory at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center has {{developed}} and demonstrated a fabrication technique using Vacuum Plasma Spray (VPS) to form structural components from a tungsten/rhenium alloy. The components were assembled into an absorber cavity for a fully-functioning, ground test unit of a solar then-nal propulsion engine. The VPS process deposits refractory metal onto a graphite mandrel {{of the desired}} shape. The mandrel acts as a <b>male</b> <b>mold,</b> forming the required contour and dimensions of the inside surface of the deposit.

40|$|ME 450 Capstone Design and Manufacturing Experience: Winter 2015 The University of Michigan Solar Car is {{designing}} a solar-powered vehicle {{that will be}} racing at speeds of over 100 kph in Australia for the 2015 World Solar Challenge. In {{order to keep the}} driver safe and support the suspension loads at these speeds, the team designs its cars around a central, structural chassis box. This chassis is currently made of a number of smaller components produced of carbon fiber and other materials which are then bonded together to form a structural single piece monocoque chassis. The existing method of manufacturing the various components involves creating female negative fiberglass <b>molds</b> from <b>male</b> positive polyurethane <b>molds.</b> Composite plies are hand-laid into the molds, cured to make parts, and then trimmed by hand. All of the components are then attached using a team standard bonding procedure. The goal of this project is to identify or develop a method of manufacturing and assembling the chassis system to decrease manufacturing time from the current 8 weeks down to 3 weeks. Potential items for the project to investigate include, but are not limited to: mold design and manufacturing methods; chassis designs; and bonding procedure and materials selection. The final deliverable will include producing a proof of concept of small scale solar vehicle using whichever manufacturing method is chosen...|$|R
40|$|A {{field study}} in Broad Cove, Newfoundland, was {{conducted}} to describe the reproductive behavior, mate selection and spawning success of the lumpfish Cyclopterus lumpus. [...] Prior to courtship male lumpfish exhibited a characteristic nuptial coloration consisting of a greyish-black body and orange-red ventral surface and fins. After an extended courtship involving nest site cleaning, caressing and quivering, females released gametes. Following fertilization, <b>males</b> engaged in <b>molding</b> behavior manipulating the eggs into the nest site producing funnel-like depressions in the egg mass. [...] Males remained with the eggs throughout the incubation period exhibiting parental behaviors essential for egg development and hatching. Parental care behaviors of males were independent of male size. Pectoral fanning and puffing were the predominant parental care behaviors exhibited throughout the incubation period. Puffing behavior appeared to increase as the eggs neared hatching. During hatching emergent larvae were swept from the nest site by male fanning and puffing behaviors. [...] Qualities of the male and characteristics of the nest site were tested as criteria for mate choice, and their effect on male spawning success was evaluated.

40|$|The Vacuum Plasma Spray (VPS) Laboratory at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center has {{developed}} and demonstrated a fabrication technique using the VPS process to form anode sections for a Lorentz force accelerator from tungsten. Lorentz force accelerators are an attractive form of electric propulsion that provides continuous, high-efficiency propulsion at useful power levels for such applications as orbit transfers or deep space missions. The VPS process {{is used to}} deposit refractory metals such as tungsten onto a graphite mandrel of the desired shape. Because tungsten is reactive at high temperatures, it is thermally sprayed in an inert environment where the plasma gun melts and accelerates the metal powder onto the mandrel.

40|$|While polymer microneedles may {{easily be}} {{fabricated}} by casting a solution in a mold, either centrifugation or vacuumizing {{is needed to}} pull the viscous polymer solution into the microholes of the mold. We report a novel process to fabricate polymer microneedles with a one-sided vacuum using a ceramic mold that is breathable but water impermeable. A polymer solution containing polyvinyl alcohol and polysaccharide was cast in a ceramic mold and then pulled into the microholes by a vacuum applied {{to the opposite side}} of the mold. After cross-linking and solidification through freeze-thawing, the microneedle patch was detached from the mold and transferred with a specially designed instrument for the drying process, during which the patch shrank evenly to form an array of regular and uniform needles without deformation. Moreover, the shrinkage of the patches helped to reduce the needles’ size to ease microfabrication of the <b>male</b> <b>mold.</b> The dried microneedle patches were finally punched to the desired sizes to achieve various properties, including sufficient strength to penetrate skin, microneedles-absorbed water-swelling ratios, and drug-release kinetics.

40|$|A {{finite element}} method is {{developed}} to solve two-dimensional consolidation problems for composites manufacturing. The consolidation governing equations, one for solid stress and one for fluid pressure, are derived using a local volume averaging approach, and the two equations are strongly coupled. A special anisotropic, hyperelastic constitutive equation is developed for the solid stress. This equation matches Gutowski's model for consolidation transverse to the fibers, and has a high stiffness parallel to the fibers. An updated Lagrangian method is used to solve the equations, using implicit time integration and a successive substitution method. The code is applied to several case studies to explore two-dimensional consolidation effects. A free edge affects the thickness profile during consolidation, but the final thickness can still be uniform. This effect is substantial in the region close to the edge, and it propagates progressively from the edge towards the center. Simulations were also performed for laminates that bend to form a corner. The corner is thicker than the flat region after consolidation. Wiggles, similar to fiber buckling, arise at low values of shear modulus when using a <b>male</b> <b>mold.</b> Large values of the solid shear modulus cause the corner effect to extend far into the adjacent flat region. The length of the flat region also affects the consolidation of the corner.

40|$|The {{design of}} a long {{wheelbase}} recumbent bicycle was carried out according to the wish to maximize the speed and comfort of the finished product. Various original design ideas were examined. Some were retained, and many were abandoned. A standard tubular truss frame design was settled on. Geometrical requirements regarding the riding position were tested using a full size wooden frame mock-up. As {{a result of that}} testing, flaws in the ergonomic assumptions were discovered and corrected for a second generation mock-up. Variations in truss configuration were examined using TRUSS (MATLAB) software to determine ways to minimize frame stresses and further lighten frame. Initial work with fiberglass in epoxy led to the conclusion that using fiber re-enforced matrix construction would be more effective with a unibody frame design than a truss. A rough copy recumbent frame was made using fiberglass and epoxy over a light foam <b>male</b> <b>mold.</b> Difficulties with that construction technique were discovered and corrected for in the final model. Before completion of the rough copy, AutoCAD modeling of the frame reveled how the frame design could be radically improved. The rough copy was finished in a sloppy manner and test rides reveled how important steering system considerations had been overlooked. ANSYS modeling of the new proposed frame geometry indicated that it would be structurally sound, and indicated improvements. These improvements were carried out. The geometry was set up to mimic the stability at speed of a mountain bike. The final copy of the bicycle was built using a unibody box section frame. All moving parts other than the fork, wheels and pedals were enclosed within the frame box to keep them clean and visually out of the way. The drive mechanism consisted of two parts: The first used a timing belt to transfer power from the primary bottom bracket to the secondary, and to gear the pedal velocity up by a factor of 2. The second used standard bicycle chain over a short length to shift gears over an unusually broad range, intended for high speed cruising. Steering control was maintained by means of twinned control wires in tension, wrapped around demi- pulley sheaves to eliminate wire path length variation. Construction on the final bicycle is still in progress as of this writing...|$|E
