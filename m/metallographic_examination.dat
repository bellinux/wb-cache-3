40|$|An {{investigation}} of under hardening of small diameter HSS drills following vacuum heat treatment is presented. Poor hardening response {{was found to}} correlate {{with a loss of}} carbon in the HSS blanks. It is shown that full hardness could be attained by removing up to 200 μm off diameter prior to vacuum heat treatment. <b>Metallographic</b> <b>examination</b> revealed that the probable cause of carbon loss was the presence of oxide scale which set up a diffusion gradient leading to rapid grain boundary diffusion of carbon. Accelerated drill testing revealed that the under hard drill had a low tool life but with lower variance. The fully hardened drills exhibited higher variance largely due to the occurrence of early life failures. <b>Metallographic</b> <b>examination</b> suggests that the latter is due to the presence of large defects in the form of fractured primary carbides formed in the drawing process...|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine the behavior of recently produced, forged S- 816 turbine blades in a full-scale turbojet engine, and in particular, the scatter in performance of the alloy. The turbine blades were operated as continuously as possible at a temperature of 1500 degrees F and a centrifugal stress of 21, 500 {{pounds per square inch}}. The operating lives of the turbine blades varied from 181 to 539 hours, a range of 358 hours. Stress-rupture properties of specimens cut from blade airfoils also varied considerably, as much as 1257 hours at 20, 000 pounds per square inch and 1500 degrees F. Since the variability of scatter of stress-rupture data is greater than that of blade performance, the scatter is probably caused by variations in the properties of the forged blades rather than by variations caused by engine operation or installation of the blades. <b>Metallographic</b> <b>examinations</b> were made to determine possible causes of the scatter and although numerous differences in microstructures of blades were found, no consistent tendencies were observed and the findings did not permit an explanation of the scatter of blade performance.
