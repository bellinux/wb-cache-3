50|$|A quick match or piped {{match is}} a type of black powder fuse that burns very quickly, some {{hundreds}} of feet per second. They consist of black match covered with a loose paper wrap (pipe). When lit, the flame propagates quickly down the paper pipe from the hot gases produced by the burning powder. Quick matches are used in professional fireworks displays to pass fire nearly instantly between devices that must be physically separated while firing simultaneously, such as a finale rack. Devices which should fire in sequence can be branched from a single <b>master</b> <b>fuse,</b> consisting of quick match spliced onto Visco fuses of various length for time delays.|$|E

5000|$|Writing in 1921, the American {{critic and}} musicologist James Huneker noted: [...] Max Reger pinned his faith to Brahms and {{absolute}} music, though not without an individual variation. In considering his Sinfonietta, the Serenade, the Hiller Variations, the Prologue to a Tragedy, the Lustspiel overture, the two concertos respectively for pianoforte and violin, we are struck {{not so much}} by the masterly handling of old forms as by the stark, emotional content of these compositions. It is an error to dismiss his music as merely academic. He began as a Brahmsianer, but he did not succeed, as did his <b>master,</b> in <b>fusing</b> form and theme. There is a Dionysian strain in him that too often is in jarring discord with the intellectual structure of his work. The furor teutonicus in conflict with the scholar. Yet at one period Reger was considered the rival of Strauss, though that day has long passed.|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} paper {{presents the}} design and simulation {{of a system of}} ground-based stereo cameras to enable the autonomous tracking of migratory raptors in order to facilitate the study of their flight patterns. A number of stations consisting of a camera pair and a processor are set up along the ridge under observation. Each station computes an estimate of the position and velocity of the birds viewed by its cameras using an Unscented Kalman Filter. The estimates from each station are transmitted to a <b>master</b> computer that <b>fuses</b> all the independent estimates and transmits the resulting estimate back to all the stations. Results of Monte Carlo simulations show the convergence of the estimated error to the true error for estimates from one or more stations. I...|$|R
50|$|Nakai {{has said}} {{that most of his}} {{inspiration}} comes from the expressions of native communities and his desire to preserve his own Native American heritage. In addition, he likes to blend his native music with that of other cultures, thereby helping to preserve their heritage as well. To that end, he has collaborated with a Japanese folk ensemble, the Philadelphia Orchestra's Israeli cellist Udi Bar-David, guitarist William Eaton, American composer Philip Glass, Tibetan flutist Nawang Khechog and flutist Paul Horn. A 2005 collaboration with slack key guitar <b>master</b> Keola Beamer <b>fused</b> two very different indigenous American cultural forms and resulted in the album Our Beloved Land. He has expressed his philosophy and views of Native American culture in the modern world in an interview with Native Digest.|$|R
50|$|Andrea draws {{significant}} influence from Masaccio, {{with whom he}} worked on the Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence altarpiece, although his works are considered outside the standard Quattrocento style to which Masaccio subscribed. Scholars note his desire to capture Masaccio’s gravitas, stoicism, and general sculptural forms, tending to focus on one of these components while incorporating the techniques of other major <b>masters.</b> In <b>fusing</b> these techniques, Andrea was likely responding to the changing preferences of his patrons as well as the emergent humanism characteristic of the Italian Renaissance; he most often did so by dramatizing the light in his compositions through Chiaroscuro, or the use of shadow and light, or including humanistic motifs like classical themes and sculptural forms. One significant example of Masaccio’s influence on Andrea is evident in a comparison of Andrea’s Madonna (Museo Stibbert) to Masaccio’s Meterzza St. Anne; Andrea imitates Masaccio’s use of chiaroscuro to light the painting starkly from left to right, a characteristic unusual to his work. However, in a similar Child of the Madonna painting (Albrighi Collection, Florence), Andrea depicts the baby in a pose often used by Masaccio, although few other elements of the painting recall the major master. In this way, while Andrea was indeed influenced by Masaccio, the influence is partially obscured firstly by Andrea’s choice to combine elements characteristic of several contemporary major masters simultaneously, and secondly by his distinct personal style, which is apparent even in heavily influenced works.|$|R
40|$|International audienceFaces play an {{important}} role in guiding visual attention, and thus, the inclusion of face detection into a classical visual attention model can improve eye movement predictions. In this study, we proposed a visual saliency model to predict eye movements during free viewing of videos. The model is inspired by the biology of the visual system and breaks down each frame of a video database into three saliency maps, each earmarked for a particular visual feature. (a) A 'static' saliency map emphasizes regions that differ from their context in terms of luminance, orientation and spatial frequency. (b) A 'dynamic' saliency map emphasizes moving regions with values proportional to motion amplitude. (c) A 'face' saliency map emphasizes areas where a face is detected with a value proportional to the confidence of the detection. In parallel, a behavioral experiment was carried out to record eye movements of participants when viewing the videos. These eye movements were compared with the models' saliency maps to quantify their efficiency. We also examined the influence of center bias on the saliency maps and incorporated it into the model in a suitable way. Finally, we proposed an efficient fusion method of all these saliency maps. Consequently, the <b>fused</b> <b>master</b> saliency map developed in this research is a good predictor of participants' eye positions...|$|R
