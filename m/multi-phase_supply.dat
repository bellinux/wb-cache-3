40|$|Abstract — The {{three-phase}} supply {{is available from}} the grid; {{there is a need to}} develop static phase transformation system to obtain <b>Multi-phase</b> <b>supply</b> from the available {{three-phase supply}}. Carrier Based PWM Technique and Special Transformer connection Technique are used to convert Threephase supply to Five-phase supply. PWM Technique is most suitable for employing two-drive systems with variable frequency which is more complicated. Hence Special Transformer Connection method is used in applications requiring fixed voltage and fixed frequency supply. This model can be simulated by using ‘SIMPOWERSYSTEMS ’ block sets of MATLAB/SIMULINK software...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{induction}} machine takes a preponderant place in many industrial applications {{due to its}} low cost and to its robustness. Nowadays, there are several standard schemes for the control {{of that kind of}} machine. In order to release a power segmentation and to increase the reliability, many engineers suggest to use <b>multi-phase</b> <b>supplies.</b> Furthermore, they advocate the dual stator winding {{induction machine}} (DSWIM), in which the two three phase stator winding systems are shifted by any angle. The main purpose of our investigation is to propose two models of the DSWIM under static eccentricity by using two shapes of the airgap function and their associated permeance functions. The first method uses a classical form of the air-gap function. The second one gives a novel expression of the air-gap function involving a Legendre polynomial development that is obtained thanks to a geometrical study of the permeance function. Simulated and experimental set-up will prove the effectiveness of both models by choosing the Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA) as the diagnosis tool...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} theoretical {{development of}} a multi-phase bridge-element concept for application to the mathematical modelling of multi-phase active power filters with multi-stage inverter. For the given number of phases in an independent electric power supply system, and for the given number of phases for each B-element, equations for phase currents and phase voltages have been written in dq 0 rotating coordinate system. The presented theoretical concept enables integrating of many elements with different number of phases into the <b>multi-phase</b> electric power <b>supply</b> system. The equations have been explained for the case of three-phase active power filter with two-stage inverter architecture, integrated in the three-phase electric power supply system...|$|R
40|$|In {{consideration}} of capacity constraints, fuzzy defect ratio, and fuzzy transport loss ratio, this paper attempted {{to establish an}} optimized decision model for production planning and distribution of a multiphase, multiproduct reverse supply chain, which addresses defects returned to original manufacturers, and in addition, develops hybrid algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization-Genetic Algorithm (PSO-GA), Genetic Algorithm-Simulated Annealing (GA-SA), and Particle Swarm Optimization-Simulated Annealing (PSO-SA) for solving the optimized model. During {{a case study of}} a <b>multi-phase,</b> multi-product reverse <b>supply</b> chain network, this paper explained the suitability of the optimized decision model and the applicability of the algorithms. Finally, the hybrid algorithms showed excellent solving capability when compared with original GA and PSO methods...|$|R
40|$|La version éditeur est disponible à cette adresse : [URL] audienceIn this paper, an {{original}} multi-phase Surface Mounted Permanent Magnet (SMPM) Machine designed for naval propulsion is proposed. The design {{objective of this}} high power low speed machine is twofold: to enhance the fault tolerance capability {{of the system and}} to optimize the quality of the torque by reducing the electromagnetic torque ripples which underlie the acoustic behaviour of the motor and of the global mechanical structure. A low level of ripple torques must also be ensured in faulty operations. To fullfill these constraints, the machine is equipped with a fractional-slot concentrated winding made up of four 3 -phase windings each one being star-connected, each star being magnetically shifted by an angle of 15 degrees. This 4 -star 3 -phase configuration allows to reduce the cogging torque and to separate magnetically and physically the phase windings. The end-turns are also drastically reduced, which improves the compactness and the efficiency of the machine. This original <b>multi-phase</b> machine is <b>supplied</b> by four 3 -phase PWM voltage source inverter with sinusoidal current law. The magnetic independences between the four star windings allow a very simple control of the four-star supply and a straightforward fault operating mode. Moreover, this 4 -star winding configuration yields to very low torque ripples in nominal configuration (four stars connected) and in faulty operations if two magnetic non adjacent stars are disconnected. For all these reasons, this structure appears particularly suitable for naval propulsion application since it increases the machine performances in terms of compactness, reliability and quality of torque...|$|R
