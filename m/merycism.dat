5|$|Rumination syndrome, or <b>Merycism,</b> is an under-diagnosed chronic {{motility}} disorder {{characterized by}} effortless regurgitation of most meals following consumption, {{due to the}} involuntary contraction of the muscles around the abdomen. There is no retching, nausea, heartburn, odour, or abdominal pain associated with the regurgitation, as there is with typical vomiting. The disorder has been historically documented as affecting only infants, young children, and people with cognitive disabilities (the prevalence {{is as high as}} 10% in institutionalized patients with various mental disabilities).|$|E
5|$|The chewing of cud by {{animals such as}} cows, goats, and giraffes is {{considered}} normal behavior. These animals are known as ruminants. Such behavior, though termed rumination, {{is not related to}} human rumination syndrome, but is ordinary. Involuntary rumination, similar to what is seen in humans, has been described in gorillas and other primates. True <b>merycism,</b> as opposed to the cud-chewing process in ruminants, is also a normal part of the digestive process in some other animals, such as kangaroos.|$|E
50|$|Eugenio Gaddini (18 January 1916 - 27 September 1985) was an Italian {{physician}} and psychoanalyst. He {{was one of}} the most important psychoanalysts in Italy and occupied a prominent place in the international psychoanalytic movement. He was interested in psyche birth and its progress beginning with lived experience. He is best known for his ideas on the rumination syndrome, or <b>merycism.</b> He wrote several books and papers including A psychoanalytic theory of infantile experience.|$|E
5000|$|From {{his work}} on {{rumination}} syndrome, or <b>merycism,</b> he developed the concept of imitation, a form of mental functioning tied to the [...] "protopsychic" [...] perception that precedes thought and that lasts a lifetime. He saw the imitation as a permanent structure {{and not just a}} precursor of the processes of identification and projection. The contribution of Gaddini was to highlight how the imitation not only represents one moment in a process that leads to the thought formation, but also a stable relational form.|$|E
50|$|Although not ruminants, hyraxes have complex, multichambered stomachs {{that allow}} {{symbiotic}} bacteria {{to break down}} tough plant materials, but their overall ability to digest fibre is {{lower than that of}} the ungulates. Their mandibular motions (see video) are deceptively similar to chewing cud, but the hyrax is physically incapable of regurgitation as in the even-toed ungulates and the <b>merycism</b> of some of the macropods. This behaviour is referred to in a passage in the Bible which describes hyraxes as chewing the cud. This chewing behaviour may be a form of agonistic behaviour when the animal feels threatened.|$|E

40|$|Kangaroos regurgitate and re-chew digesta on an {{occasional}} basis; the behaviour has been termed ‘merycism’. <b>Merycism</b> {{is distinct from}} rumination, as it is non-essential for digestive activity, significantly varies in rhythm and frequency, and causes seeming distress. Triggering mechanisms and potential benefits of this behaviour remain unknown. Although often reported, detailed descriptions of macropod <b>merycism</b> are lacking. We performed a systematic evaluation {{of a series of}} anecdotal observations of five western grey (Macropus fuliginosus) and one red kangaroos (Macropus rufus) in a feeding situation on two different diets in captivity. We recorded 14 videos with lucerne pellets and 3 videos with chopped lucerne hay feeding, covering a total of 4 h 23 min of footage with 23 regurgitation events. A characteristic <b>merycism</b> sequence consisted of retreat from the feeding trough, pumping abdominal contractions, slurping, re-chewing and re-swallowing. Individual kangaroos performed different behavioural features, apparently to support the abdominal contractions including throwing back their head (64 ± 40 (SD) %) or, rarely, pumping movements of the forelimbs. Additionally, instead of keeping digesta within the oral cavity and re-swallowing it, it was sometimes spilled (35 ± 40 % of the cases). We confirmed characteristic features of <b>merycism</b> previously reported, including the clear distinction to rumination. We hypothesize that the purpose of <b>merycism</b> is the grinding of not sufficiently chewed food particles that trigger specific contractions of the forestomach beyond voluntary control. The numerically higher frequency of this behaviour during pellet compared to hay feeding could support this hypothesis, as pellets were often gobbled hastily. In accord with observations in the literature, we hypothesize that <b>merycism</b> happens more frequently in captivity, as the type of food, fixed feeding times and limited feeding spots make rapid ingestion of food, possibly without proper mastication (i. e. gobbling), more likely...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the feeding behavior of sheep fed with diets containing different levels of palm kernel meal (PKM) substituted for corn silage, a metabolic assay was performed on 20 ewes (5 treatments × 4 replicates) over 25 d. The animals received corn silage diets {{with the addition of}} increasing levels of PKM (0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 %). The following parameters were evaluated: dry matter (DM) intake, neutral detergent fiber (NDF) intake, feeding time, rumination time, idle time, number of <b>merycism</b> mastications per bolus, time spent ruminating each bolus, DM and NDF per bolus, number of ruminated boluses per day, feeding and rumination efficiency, total chewing time, and number of <b>merycism</b> mastications per day. The daily intake of both DM and NDF increased linearly (P < 0. 05), and when sheep were fed diets of at least 43. 18 and 39. 15 % PKM, respectively, the consumption values were significantly different than when sheep were fed diets with 0 % PKM (P < 0. 05). In contrast, feeding time declined linearly, and in response to diets with at least 28. 05 % PKM, the sheep exhibited significantly different feeding times from those of sheep fed 0 % PKM, with a reduction of 0. 0613 percentage points per 1 % increase in PKM. Idle time, rumination time, and rumination time per bolus each exhibited quadratic responses (P < 0. 05), and the minimum rumination time per bolus was 44. 37 s with 35. 19 % PKM. A quadratic response was also observed for total chewing time and both measures of <b>merycism</b> mastications (P < 0. 05). Therefore, we concluded that the inclusion of PKM in the diets of sheep improves some parameters of feeding behavior, and the use of PKM is recommended at DM percentages of up to 40 %...|$|E
40|$|Behavioral {{observations}} and small fecal particles {{compared to other}} primates indicate that free-ranging proboscis monkeys (Nasalis larvatus) have a strategy of facultative <b>merycism</b> (rumination). In functional ruminants (ruminant and camelids), rumination is facilitated by a particle sorting mechanism in the forestomach that selectively retains larger particles and subjects them to repeated mastication. Using a set of a solute and three particle markers of different sizes (b 2, 5 and 8 mm), we displayed digesta passage kinetics and measured mean retention times (MRTs) in four captive proboscis monkeys (6 – 18 kg) and compared the marker excretion patterns to those in domestic cattle. In addition, we evaluated various methods of calculating and displaying passage characteristics. The mean ± SD dry matter intake was 98 ± 22 g kg− 0. 75 d− 1, 68 ± 7 % of which was browse. Accounting for sampling intervals in MRT calculation yielded results that were not affected by the sampling frequency. Displaying marker excretion patterns using fecal marker concentrations (rather than amounts) facilitated com- parisons with reactor theory outputs and indicated that both proboscis and cattle digestive tracts represent a se- ries of very few tank reactors. However, {{the separation of the}} solute and particle marker and the different-sized particle markers, evident in cattle, did not occur in proboscis monkeys, in which all markers moved together, at MRTs of approximately 40 h. The results indicate that the digestive physiology of proboscis monkeys does not show typical characteristics of ruminants, which may explain why <b>merycism</b> is only a facultative strategy in this species...|$|E
