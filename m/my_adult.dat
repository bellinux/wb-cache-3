I doubt it. One of my oldest friends–he was born in 1847–was Sir James Agg-Gardner, a little man and a great lover of wine: he was M.P. for Cheltenham, and Chairman of the Kitchen Committee of the House of Commons; {{he was one of}} a few friends who lunched with me at my old Mark Lane headquarters, in 1918, to celebrate my return to civilian life. There were still, on that day, four magnums of Cockburn 1847 in the cellar; we had one of them and it really was magnificent! We were {{on the eve of a}} General Election and we all drank good luck to Sir James in the wine of his own vintage. I promised him, somewhat rashly, another magnum of 1847 Cockburn, should he be re-elected. He was re-elected, of course, not only that year, but twice again during the next twelve months: it took three elections in two years to get a working majority, and this was why and how my last three magnums of Cockburn 1847 went in two years! No regrets: they were at their best and could not possibly have been any better had they been kept any longer.|$|E
500|$|She made {{statements}} {{critical of}} the Bush administration for not deploying enough troops during the Iraq War. [...] Her close examination of the financial books of the McCain campaign during {{the first part of}} 2007 convinced the candidate that its profligate spending could not go on and led to the drastic mid-year reduction of the campaign's staff and scope. In February 2008, McCain made news by being critical of Michelle Obama, the wife of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, who had said, [...] "And let me tell you something: For the first time in <b>my</b> <b>adult</b> lifetime I am really proud of my country." [...] McCain, who was genuinely offended by the remark, replied: [...] "I am proud of my country. I don't know about you—if you heard those words earlier—I am very proud of my country." [...] Also in February 2008, she publicly appeared beside her husband during a press conference in response to a newspaper report regarding his connection to a lobbyist.|$|E
500|$|In a {{study of}} a working-class lesbian {{community}} in Buffalo, New York, in the 1940s and 1950s, The Well of Loneliness was the only work of lesbian literature anyone had read or heard of. For many young lesbians in the 1950s, {{it was the only}} source of information about lesbianism. The Wells name recognition made it possible to find when bookstores and libraries did not yet have sections devoted to LGBT literature. As late as 1994, an article in Feminist Review noted that The Well [...] "regularly appears in coming-out stories– and not just those of older lesbians". It has often been mocked: Terry Castle says that [...] "like many bookish lesbians I seem to have spent much of <b>my</b> <b>adult</b> life making jokes about it", and Mary Renault, who read it in 1938, remembered laughing at its [...] "earnest humourlessness" [...] and [...] "impermissible allowance of self-pity". Yet it has also produced powerful emotional responses, both positive and negative. One woman was so angry at the thought of how The Well would affect an [...] "isolated emerging lesbian" [...] that she [...] "wrote a note in the library book, to tell other readers that women loving women can be beautiful". A Holocaust survivor said, [...] "Remembering that book, I wanted to live long enough to kiss another woman." ...|$|E

On that day, a tearful Lee Kuan Yew announced on a televised press conference that Singapore was a sovereign, independent nation. In a widely remembered quote, he uttered that: [...] "I mean for me, {{it would be a}} moment of anguish because all my life….you see the whole of <b>my</b> <b>adult</b> life….

[...] Barack's response to the criticism was, [...] "Statements like this are made, and people try to take it out of context and make a great big deal out of it, and that isn't at all what she meant. What she meant was, this is the first time that she's been proud of the politics of America," [...] he said.

[...] The SCM conducted small study groups in which students were encouraged to discuss their beliefs freely and come to their own conclusions about how to interpret the Gospels. For Muriel, such discussions were unsettling and painful, yet also exciting. [...] "I had always before treated the Gospel as though its authors had set down day by day events in the life of Jesus as they happened," [...] she said. [...] "To face the implication that nothing was written down until after Jesus died was itself a shock. But this question of free and open discussion, that everything needed to be challenged, to be questioned, to be talked about, that was completely opposite to the authoritarian approach in the church." [...] The SCM study groups fostered independent thinking. [...] "This was the beginning of <b>my</b> <b>adult</b> search for truth," [...] Muriel told her biographer, [...] "and my sense that all things must be open to me." ...|$|E

[...] Prior to challenging Emerson, {{by his own}} telling the then-32-year-old Carnahan had already [...] "been active in government and politics for most of <b>my</b> <b>adult</b> life." [...] Carnahan was active in several of his late father’s political campaigns, including successful bids for state treasurer (1980) and lieutenant governor (1988), and an unsuccessful race for governor (1984). [...] In January 1980, Carnahan slept for five days on the floor outside the Secretary of State’s Office in the Missouri State Capitol in Jefferson City, to ensure that his father’s name would be first on the ballot for Missouri State Treasurer when filing opened on January 8. [...] Said Carnahan, [...] "A {{lot of people get}} football tickets this way. [...] It’s {{going to be a long}} five days, so I guess we’ll get some sleeping bags and a TV in here." [...] And in 1984, when his father ran for state treasurer, Carnahan made stump speeches for him across Missouri. [...] Carnahan also had already worked for Missouri House Speaker Bob F. Griffin, Missouri Secretary of State Jim Kirkpatrick, and Missouri House Majority Leader Tony Ribaudo; had served on the executive committee of the Missouri Democratic Party; and, was the deputy Missouri campaign manager for Dick Gephardt’s 1988 presidential campaign.|$|E

2500|$|Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle {{called the}} film [...] "the most intense and {{original}} creature feature I've seen in <b>my</b> <b>adult</b> moviegoing life [...] a pure-blood, grade A, exhilarating monster movie." [...] He cites Matt Reeves' direction, the [...] "whip-smart, stylistically invisible" [...] script and the [...] "nearly subconscious evocation {{of our current}} paranoid, terror-phobic times" [...] as {{the keys to the}} film's success, saying that telling the story through the lens of one character's camera [...] "works fantastically well". Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter called it [...] "chillingly effective", generally praising the effects and the film's [...] "claustrophobic intensity". He said that though the characters [...] "aren't particularly interesting or developed", there was [...] "something refreshing about a monster movie that isn't filled with the usual suspects". Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly said that the film was [...] "surreptitiously subversive, [...] stylistically clever little gem", and that while the characters were [...] "vapid, twenty-something nincompoops" [...] and the acting [...] "appropriately unmemorable", the decision to tell the story through amateur footage was [...] "brilliant". Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that the film is [...] "pretty scary at times" [...] and cites [...] "unmistakable evocations of 9/11". He concludes that [...] "all in all, it is an effective film, deploying its special effects well and never breaking the illusion that it is all happening as we see it".|$|E

[...] "In the interests of historical accuracy I should say that, yes, Gilbert was a troublemaker and an occasional liar, but my character was certainly no Eddie Haskell – that leering teenage hypocrite who spoke unctuously to parents ('Well, hello Mrs. Cleaver, and how is young Theodore today?') and venomously to the Beav ('Hey, squirt, take a powder before I squash you like a bug')."!

In the early '80s, I turned down an offer to revive my role as Gilbert in a dreadful Beaver reunion series.
