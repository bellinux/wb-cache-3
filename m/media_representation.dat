40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> {{of civil}} society organizations (CSOs) through quantitative content analysis of four dailies (HN, LN, MFD and Právo). The aim is to analyze and describe CSOs <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> in relation to media elements that characterize these representations, {{as well as through}} space and priority, organizations and actors that are associated with. The selected method allows the comparison of <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> for particular newspapers. The study builds on a social-constructivist paradigm, focusing on the agenda-setting theory, gatekeeping and news values. Thesis also discusses specifics of the CSOs and non-profit logic in relation to media and journalistic logic and their influence on the final CSOs <b>media</b> <b>representations,</b> including potential nonprofit dilemmas. The <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> are strongly determined by regionality and relationship with other sectors. CSOs are presented through positive and uncontroversial theme of good deeds.

[...] Feminist academic and AIDS video producer Alexandra Juhasz puts forth the film as [...] "an effective critique of the silly sensationalism used in much reportage of AIDS science [...] fights melodrama and tabloid journalism -- with melodrama and tabloid journalism."

500|$|EastEnders has {{received}} {{praise for the}} handling of Peggy's breast cancer storyline, as she was a rare media portrayal of an older matriarchal woman with the disease. Older women are at higher risk of being diagnosed; however, in 2001, {{it was reported that}} <b>media</b> <b>representation</b> of breast cancer is skewed towards younger women in their 20s or 30s, as they are seen as [...] "more tragic" [...] or [...] "more sexy" [...] in media terms. A 2000 study by Kitzinger and Henderson showed that 94% of newspaper coverage on non-celebrity women with breast cancer was on those aged under 50. Source organisations working with EastEnders on the storyline have commented: [...] " [...] decided {{it was going to be}} [...] and very rightly so. Bang on, the right age [...] perfect dramatic licence in terms of her sons that she was going to have to share this terrible news with, and how would she share it? Every female would have that problem. How would you tell your children? And they followed that with her. She was exactly the right person." [...] The storyline also received media criticism, for the use of a breast care nurse, who was used to counsel Peggy and translate medical terminology into lay terms for viewers; a character who could provide both a dramatic and educational purpose. However, not all oncology units in the UK offer breast care nurses, and the character presented [...] "particularly positive messages" [...] concerning patient choice and control over treatment options. Because of this, the UK press dubbed the storyline [...] "didactic". The storyline was also criticised because Peggy received her cancer test results after six days, which prompted cancer charities to warn that not all patients would receive the same treatment.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss the impact gendered <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> of {{entrepreneurs}} may have on the reality of female entrepreneurship. It analyses the representation of women entrepreneurs in a women's magazine. <b>Media</b> <b>representations</b> influence, firstly, whether women perceive entrepreneurship as desirable and attainable, and thus impact the strength and direction of their entrepreneurial aspirations. Secondly, <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> shape how key stakeholders such as bankers or clients view and interact with female business owners, thereby impacting women entrepreneurs’ business relations and opportunities. The paper reviews research on <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> of women entrepreneurs, gender inequalities in entrepreneurial activity and work before presenting an in-depth qualitative analysis of a magazine series reporting on female entrepreneurs. The authors’ analysis reveals how the woman's magazine in question portrays female entrepreneurship as focused on traditionally female activities and pursuits and as domestically-centred. Relating these findings to evidence on gender inequalities in entrepreneurial activity, the paper raises important questions about the impact of <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> of women entrepreneurs. The paper demonstrates the benefits of understanding entrepreneurial activity as work and includes analytical perspectives from the sociology of work in the analysis of <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> of entrepreneurship...|$|R

Through textual analysis of media sites featuring HIV/AIDS and blackness (The Announcement, Precious, and Marvelyn Brown’s website, www. marvelynbrown. com), this project analyzes how {{the politics of}} respectability—a set of precepts that govern how {{black men and women}} can present themselves in public spaces to align with white ideals of gender and sexuality—construct black people in <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> of HIV/AIDS. This work examines how respectability politics deployed in <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> of HIV/AIDS and black Americans reclaim notions of acceptable black sexuality by reifying age-old stereotypes of black masculinity femininity. I argue that the goal of respectability politics in countering anti-blackness through limited parameters for acceptable presentations of racialized gender and sexuality continue to challenge and complicate <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> of HIV/AIDS and black Americans...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Since {{the turn}} of the millennium, {{millions}} of people born between the late 1970 s and the late 1990 s have been categorized as “millennials. ” A media discourse tells people what a millennial is and is not, shaping how those people it depicts as “millen-nial ” may perceive themselves and how others perceive them. This paper examines four <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> of the millennial: a member of a youth cohort, a consumer, a worker to be managed, and an immiserated victim of hard times. It argues that these four <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> of the millennial distort the capitalist determinations of millennial life and labour and prevent the millennials from seeing themselves as part of the working class. By way of a critique of these four ideological <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> of the class-less millennial, the paper forwards a historical-materialist account of the millennial working class in a new capitalist millennium...|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} 1970 s, feminists began to raise {{awareness}} about intimate partner violence (IPV), transforming it from a private family matter into a social problem. Popular <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> of IPV, which exposed the extent and severity of the problem, {{played a key role}} in this transition. Surprisingly, however, there has been very little research on <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> of IPV or intimate partner homicide (IPH). This thesis conducts a critical discourse analysis on recent <b>media</b> <b>representations</b> of abused women who kill their abusive partners in law procedural dramas, a genre of television that both commands a wide prime-time audience and impacts viewers’ understanding of the legal system. I argue that the common representational tropes used in these episodes actively harm abused women by constructing only abuse narratives that reinforce misogynistic tropes as valid and by suggesting that the legal system meets abused women’s needs...|$|R
