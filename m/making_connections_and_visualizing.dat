50|$|Analogies are a {{comparison}} between two things that are usually seen as {{different from each other}} but have some similarities. They act as an aid to understanding things by <b>making</b> <b>connections</b> <b>and</b> seeing relationships between them based on knowledge already possessed. Comparisons like these {{play an important role in}} improving problem-solving and decision-making skills, in perception and memory, in communication and reasoning skills, and in reading and building vocabulary. Analogies help students to process information actively, make important decisions, and improve understanding and long-term memory. Considering the relationships stimulates critical and creative thinking.|$|R

40|$|Humans learn through {{interaction}} with their environment. The most important {{components of the}} environment for learning are other humans and their artefacts. Historically learning {{has been seen as}} acquiring knowledge and storing it away for future use. However, more recent views have suggested that learning is more about <b>making</b> <b>connections</b> <b>and</b> that, in a world where information is constantly changing and increasing, capacity to learn through <b>making</b> <b>and</b> using <b>connections</b> to other people may be more important than what we actually know. Where once our social <b>connections,</b> <b>and</b> access to learning, were limited by capacity to travel for direct contact or by the speed with which correspondence could be exchanged, modern information and communication technology enables essentially instant communication with people anywhere on the planet. This chapter explores some implications of these changes for how educators approach the facilitation of learning in an age of global information networks. ...|$|R
40|$|Classroom conversations are core to {{establishing}} successful learning for students. This research explored {{the nature of}} conversation in technology education in the primary classroom and the implications for teaching and learning. Over a year, two units of work in technology were taught in two primary classrooms. Most data was gathered in Round 2 during {{the implementation of the}} second unit titled ‘Props for the School Production’. It used qualitative methodology and an ethnographic approach using participant observations, Stimulated Recall interviews with autophotography, semi-structured interviews with participants and their teachers, and students’ work samples, to develop a rich description of classroom conversation in technology. Initial data identified four significant stages of learning within the second technology unit; these included Stage 1 Character and Function, Stage 2 Planning, Stage 3 Mock-up and Stage 4 Construction. Four over-arching elements of conversation, each with various sub elements, were identified as flowing through the classroom conversations. These were Funds of Knowledge, <b>Making</b> <b>Connections</b> <b>and</b> Links, Management of Learning, and Technology Knowledge and Skills. These elements describe the sources and the purpose of conversation. For example, conversations identified as Funds of Knowledge showed students brought knowledge and or skills learned from home and their community to their technology learning. In <b>Making</b> <b>Connections</b> <b>and</b> Links, students implemented knowledge from school based learning. Management of Learning included classroom conversations initiated by both teachers and students, which enhanced or managed students’ learning in some way. In the fourth element, technological knowledge and skills learned were evidenced. Further analysis of the elements identified three over-arching themes of conversations. The first, ‘Deployment’, describes knowledge and skills brought by students to their technological practice and included the elements Funds of Knowledge <b>and</b> <b>Making</b> <b>Connections</b> <b>and</b> Links. The second, ‘Conduit’, described techniques and strategies used by teachers and students to maximise learning opportunities acting as a conduit between other knowledge and technological knowledge, and was mainly situated within the Management of Learning element. The third theme, ‘Knowledge’, showed the exact nature of technology learning obtained by the students though the bringing together of the first two themes, rather like a set of interconnected cogs. The study makes a significant contribution to understanding how students learn in technology education. It develops current {{understanding of the nature of}} talk and the role it plays in learning technology. It also presents new findings on the Funds of Knowledge students bring to technology and it challenges existing findings on students’ ability to transfer knowledge from one domain to other. Finally, it identifies a gap in existing research into students’ abilities to investigate and select appropriate materials for intermediate and final outcomes...|$|R

Textalyser software was used to rank frequently-occurring terms related to problems, emotional states, and coping strategies. Frequently-cited problems included: lack of electric power, water, gasoline, information, and communication. Frequently-cited emotional states included: worry, stress, fear, and feelings of being threatened and trapped. Frequently-cited coping strategies related to resiliency included: <b>making</b> <b>connections</b> <b>and</b> exhibiting social skills through communication, giving and receiving help; reading; problem-solving and information skills; life skills, indicated by survival in catastrophic circumstances; taking care of others; and participation in recovery and relief efforts...|$|R
40|$|Through {{the lens}} of an {{innovative}} community-university partnership in the Greater Boston region, the authors analyze how welfare reform organizing overtook a resident-driven empowerment project. Since a major goal of the Chelsea/Dudley Partnership in MA is to support residents in exerting greater power over the practices and policies of community agencies, projects have been initiated {{in the city of}} Chelsea and the Dudley neighborhood of Boston to organize, and to strengthen, low income women by training them as welfare advocates. This paper examines how the efforts evolved, and how the community and the university partners are playing a key role in <b>making</b> <b>connections</b> <b>and</b> developing skills.

40|$|This work {{addresses}} the performative nature of language: the <b>connection</b> between language <b>and</b> performance; in essence, it will address how words make things happen. The <b>connection</b> between language <b>and</b> performance is explored in two very distinct ways via extended essays. The first essay {{looks at the}} connection between language performance and ecosystems {{through the lens of}} endangered languages and their relationship to ecosystem health and the world’s current wave of species extinction, and argues that language may have a biological role in the natural world. The second essay explores the idea of “language acts” through the academic methods of performance studies and research-creation. In this essay, a biographical play and dramatization of writer Emily Brontë contends that Brontë was a proto-modernist artist. This work also serves as an exercise, a language act, in <b>making</b> <b>connections</b> <b>and</b> in <b>making</b> meaning, through the lens of the GLS experience...|$|R
40|$|This {{exploratory}} paper {{examines how}} knowledge acquired via guanxi (networks <b>and</b> <b>connections)</b> have enabled women-led firms in China {{to overcome a}} number of significant barriers and challenges in order to start and grow a successful business. We draw upon two case studies, in order to illustrate how they have utilized guanxi as a means of overcoming these barriers. We investigate the way in which guanxi facilitates the business owner in engaging in a process of entrepreneurial learning (Harrison and Leitch 2005; Politis, 2008) – <b>and</b> <b>making</b> <b>connections</b> <b>and</b> contacts – by which she is able to improve the firm’s performance. Further research is necessary to build upon a small number of studies that have already cleared the ground in terms of guanxi.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to examine and reflect on how students understanding increased when technology is used in the mathematics classroom. Through a review of the literature, lesson study and action research; this manuscript will explore the correlations between educational technology and students understanding. Over a two week period students in three high school mathematics courses were observed in their natural classroom setting to determine if there was a correlation between the use of educational technology and students understanding of mathematics. In two of the three classes students used graphing calculator technology to enhance their w 1 derstanding of quadratic functions. The third course students used the Carnegie Learning Tutorial to better their understanding of solving linear equations. Following the observations, it was evident that the technology did impact their understanding of mathematics. After using the technology, students were able to make <b>connections</b> <b>and</b> <b>visualize</b> the concepts that were being taught. Through a constructivist approach to learning students were engaged in real world problem solving activitie...|$|R
30|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the field of electronic textiles (e-textiles), an area where textile materiality and electronic capability merge in the creation of textiles that enable electronic and digital functionalities to be embedded in them. Whereas very different in many aspects, textiles and electronics are increasingly seen as potentially complementary rather than mutually exclusive disciplines, spreading into the domains of fashion, product design, material research, and education. Research into how to make textile sensors (e.g., Perner-Wilson et al 2010) and how to ease the integration of computational hardware with textile material (Buechley 2006), among others, have greatly improved the field’s accessibility. A range of kits are available providing specifically designed electronic components that can be sewn onto fabric, as well as conductive and resistive threads for <b>making</b> <b>connections</b> <b>and</b> crafting sensor. All of these enable new groups to engage and contribute to diverse creations (Buechley et al. 2008).|$|R
40|$|Abstract Semantic {{dementia}} is {{a variant}} of frontotemporal dementia and is a recently recognized diagnostic condition. There has been some research quantitatively examining care partner stress and burden in frontotemporal dementia. There are, however, few studies exploring the subjective experiences of family members caring for those with frontotemporal dementia. Increased knowledge of such experiences would allow service providers to tailor intervention, support, and information better. We used a case study design, with thematic narrative analysis applied to interview data, to describe the experiences of a wife and son caring for a husband/father with semantic dementia. Using this approach, we identified four themes: (a) living with routines, (b) policing <b>and</b> protecting, (c) <b>making</b> <b>connections,</b> <b>and</b> (d) being adaptive and flexible. Each of these themes were shared and extended, with the importance of routines in everyday life highlighted. The implications for policy, practice, and research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{integrative}} review was to evaluate {{the current state of}} knowledge of parents who have adult children diagnosed with schizophrenia and their relationship with mental health professionals. Findings indicated that parents (primarily mothers) believed they intuitively knew when their adult children were becoming unwell and that they doggedly pursued connections with mental health care providers. Five themes were evident in the literature: trusting your instincts, feeling dismissed <b>and</b> devalued, <b>making</b> <b>connections</b> <b>and</b> <b>making</b> concessions, living with distress and sorrow, and becoming your own health-care provider. The implications of the findings on mental health nursing practice indicate that professional family relationships were not ideal, and that parents wanted to improve these relationships. Parents wanted health-care professionals to respond to their requests for help for both their children and for themselves, and {{wanted to be able to}} help the mental health team to help their adult children...|$|R
5000|$|A {{leadership}} {{model that}} introduced Batty and Quinn consists three components: who, how, and what. The three interdependent processes {{of this model}} are thinking, acting, and influencing. (Beatty and Quinn, 2010). Strategic leaders {{have the ability to}} determine effective intervention points. This means that the strategy of an effective leader is to develop new visions, create new strategic and move in a new, sometimes unexpected, direction. At these strategic opportunity points, the most important component is the timing of when to intervene and directing change verse what the intervention is put in place. Strategic leaders think strategically. Strategic thinking, as Batty and Quinn states, involves gathering, <b>making</b> <b>connections,</b> <b>and</b> filtering information or “form ideas and strategies that are focused, relevant, and sound.” (Beatty and Quinn, 2010, p. 5). The significance of strategic leadership “is making decisions about whether and when to act.” (Beatty and Quinn, 2010, p. 6).|$|R

30|$|Chris Reid {{has used}} his degree in {{electrical}} engineering from UW to jump-start his career in entrepreneurship. In an Ontario Center of Excellence blog, he writes: “I think entrepreneurship chose me.” Growing up, he could not not think about business. And today, he admits he would not do anything else. His first start-up was Snapsort, founded with two other UW graduates. The trio raised $ 500 k from undisclosed investors in 2011. They spent 2  years developing their recommendation platform. Snapsort collects reviews, prices, and product information for online shoppers. The idea for his next start-up Sortable came out of Snapsort. It {{is designed to help}} publishers maximize ad revenues from websites. Prior to its move to a local strip mall, it was located in UW’s software, hardware, and science start-up incubator—the Velocity Garage.
