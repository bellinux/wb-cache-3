The <b>method</b> <b>by</b> discretes of parts with stagger-tuned circuits, the <b>method</b> <b>by</b> operational amplifier THS 3201 and the <b>method</b> <b>by</b> monolitic amplifier ERA- 3. The <b>Method</b> <b>by</b> operational amplifier THS 3201 is chosen like the best method, because this operational amplifier can amplify very small signals.

40|$|In this study, direct shear type {{bond test}} is {{conducted}} to examine the anchor behavior of CFRP plate to concrete. CFRP plate is bonded to concrete and anchored by five types of anchor method. In case of anchorage <b>method</b> <b>by</b> carbon fiber sheet, the debonding of CFRP plate is restrained after maximum load. In case of anchorage <b>method</b> <b>by</b> multilayer CFRP plate, effectiveness of anchor strength is not confirmed. In case of anchorage <b>method</b> <b>by</b> steel plate, most effective anchor behavior is obtained and maximum load is more than 3. 65 times of the calculated bond strength without anchorage. In case of anchorage <b>method</b> <b>by</b> mortar spacer and carbon fiber sheet, maximum load is 1. 09 - 1. 72 times of the calculated bond strength. Even if load decreases once, load increases again to about 0. 6 - 0. 9 times of the maximum load. In case of anchorage <b>method</b> <b>by</b> side CFRP plate and carbon fiber sheet, bond strength increases by sharing the tensile force through carbon fiber sheet...|$|R
