5|$|As {{there was}} no defined anti-shipping role in pre-war plans, obtaining {{information}} on the enemy's seaborne commercial traffic did not receive high priority, and once the war started, {{it was difficult to}} establish quickly the means of acquiring this information, especially after the fall of Norway and France in April and May 1940. The extent of the intelligence vacuum at the start of Coastal Command's campaign is demonstrated by the fact that Air Ministry planners were unaware of the heavy anti-aircraft armament being fitted to enemy merchant vessels.

When Charles Stewart Parnell was falsely accused of inciting murder Wilde wrote a series of astute columns defending him in the Daily Chronicle.|$|E

Charlton was unsuccessful in gaining better conditions for the miners but he did settle the dispute, talking to miners around the state and convincing them to return to work. He resigned from state politics and in 1910 Charlton wrested the federal Division of Hunter from the sitting Frank Liddell. Hunter has remained a safe Labor seat ever since.|$|E

From the observed abundances of light elements, dark <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> galaxies must be primarily nonbaryonic.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging confirmed previously that people who used spatial memory strategies showed increased activity in the hippocampus, whereas response strategies were associated with activity in the caudate nucleus. Here, voxel based morphometry was used to identify brain regions covarying with the navigational strategies used by individuals. Results showed that spatial learners had significantly more gray <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> the hippocampus and less gray <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> the caudate nucleus compared with response learners. Furthermore, the gray <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> the hippocampus was negatively correlated to the gray <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> the caudate nucleus, suggesting a competitive interaction between these two brain areas. In a second analysis, the gray matter of regions known to be anatomically connected to the hippocampus, such as the amygdala, parahippocampal, perirhinal, entorhinal and orbitofrontal cortices were shown to covary with gray <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> the hippocampus. Because low gray <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> the hippocampus is {{a risk factor for}} Alzheimer’s disease, these results have important implications for intervention programs that aim at functional recovery in these brain areas.
