50|$|The {{other aspect}} {{is seen in}} the {{presence}} of a quadratic form Q on V; if it is non-degenerate it allows an identification of the dual space V* of V with V. The relation of V* to V is not intrinsic; it depends on a choice of Haar <b>measure</b> (<b>volume</b> element) on <b>V.</b> But given an identification of the two, which is in any case well-defined up to a scalar, the presence of Q allows one to speak to the dual lattice to L while staying within V.|$|R

The {{intensity of the}} optical radiation part passing through the <b>measuring</b> <b>volume</b> and distributed in <b>measuring</b> <b>volume</b> laterally to the trans-illuminating direction, is measured in trans-illuminating direction by the <b>measuring</b> <b>volume.</b> The oil content is calculated from measured intensity values on basis of previous calibration oil content. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a device for determining of oil content of cleaning fluid. USE - Method for determining of the oil content of a cleaning fluid. ADVANTAGE - The intensity of the optical radiation part, which passes through the <b>measuring</b> <b>volume</b> and distributed in <b>measuring</b> <b>volume</b> laterally to the trans-illuminating direction, is measured in trans-illuminating direction by the <b>measuring</b> <b>volume,</b> and hence ensures continuous and accurate regulation for the oil concentration of the cleaning fluid at low cost...|$|R
