50|$|The back <b>media</b> <b>tray</b> snaps {{into the}} back cover, and is {{responsible}} for securing the disk. The center is a circular hub of teeth which grip the disc by its hole. This effectively suspends the disk {{in the middle of}} the container, preventing the recording surface from being scratched. The <b>media</b> <b>tray</b> was originally constructed of a flexible black polystyrene, but many newer trays use a more fragile transparent polystyrene. This allows the reverse of the back card, which is usually used for additional artwork, to be visible. This format did not become common until the mid-1990s.|$|E
5000|$|... 2015: The new H3580 pick&place {{test handler}} {{provides}} a throughput of 33,000 units per hour, configurable input/output <b>media</b> (<b>tray,</b> bulk, wafer/strip on tape, output reel), MEMS stimulus for different devices (inertial sensors, humidity sensors, pressure sensors, UV sensors, proximity sensors, MEMS microphones, magnetic sensors, combo sensors, and other IC devices) and configurable pickup number, matrix and pitch.|$|E
5000|$|Double disc albums {{can either}} be {{packaged}} in standard-thickness jewel cases with hinged <b>media</b> <b>trays</b> which can be lifted to reveal the second disc (trays hinged on the left are known as [...] "Smart Tray" [...] format; those hinged on the right are known as [...] "Brilliant Box" [...] format) or in a [...] "double jewel case", sometimes called a multi-CD jewel case, [...] "fatbox" [...] or [...] "Bookbox", which is slightly larger than two normal jewel cases stacked {{on top of each}} other, and can hold 2 to 6 CDs. Double jewel cases do not fit in some CD racks; however, some racks have a few extra wide slots specifically to accommodate them.|$|R

50|$|Paper handling: Media can {{redirected}} {{to different}} output bins (up to 256). Added A6 and Japanese B6 preset media sizes. Added Third cassette preset, 248 external <b>tray</b> <b>media</b> sources.|$|R
5000|$|The CD {{comes in}} a {{standard}} jewel case with a transparent tray, but the insert folds out {{into the shape of}} a cross with Rasputin's head at the top. The <b>media</b> <b>tray</b> has the words [...] "Снова Мертвый" [...] (Dead Again) visible underneath along with Rasputin's autopsy information. The photograph on the back was taken in 1906, showing four young women of the Tsarist family, identified left to right as Grand Duchesses Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia Nikolaevna.|$|E
50|$|A jewel CD case is {{a compact}} disc case {{that has been used}} since the compact disc was first {{released}} in 1982. It is a three-piece plastic case, measuring 142 × 125 × 10 mm, a volume of , which usually contains a compact disc along with the liner notes and a back card. Two opposing transparent halves are hinged together to form the casing, the back half holding a <b>media</b> <b>tray</b> that grips the disc by its hole. All three parts are made of injection-moulded polystyrene.|$|E
50|$|The Veris uses an {{automated}} stack fed <b>media</b> <b>tray.</b> The printer incorporates a small video camera {{that is used}} to scan media marks printed on the edges of the media. These are effectively like two-dimensional bar-code marks that uniquely identify each sheet of media and contain other information such as the media type and even the lot number the media was produced from. The software prevents the media from being printed on more than twice - it is possible to print on one half of the media, flip the media around and print on the other half. The software also prevents the wrong type of media from being used for the wrong job, and can search for the correct media from the input tray of the printer.|$|E
40|$|Research on the {{application}} of innovative biodegradable materials for substrate mulching in greenhouse floricultural cultivation {{was carried out in}} Southern Italy. A transparent biodegradable film and a transparent biodegradable spray coating were compared with a commercial transparent low density polyethylene film. The biodegradable film was a starch based extruded material, the sprayed coating was created from a polysaccharide solution. The materials were used to mulch the peat and perlite growing <b>media</b> contained in <b>trays</b> during snapdragon cultivation in order to increase the substrate temperature and hasten early growth. The climate variables inside and outside the greenhouse and the growing medium temperature under the mulching materials were recorded. Biometrical data, such as mean blooming time, plant height and spike length, were collected. The laboratory radiometric tests showed that the biodegradable mulching materials had a lower solar transmissivity in comparison to the low density polyethylene film. The capacity to reduce the long wave infrared thermal losses was higher for the biodegradable mulches: the long wave infrared transmissivity coefficient was 53. 9...|$|R
40|$|The {{search for}} {{suitable}} organic growing media substitutes for pine bark based media combinations has been prompted by concerns over high costs {{and lack of}} availability to smallholder farmers coupled with increasing demand for soilless media in Zimbabwe. A trial was conducted for 12 weeks to investigate the suitability of tea tree compost-based substrates for tobacco seedling production as a substitute of the traditional pine bark growing media. The use of composted tea tree growing <b>media</b> in float <b>trays</b> significantly (p< 0. 05) increases the bulk density of the media by 23 – 59 % when compared with pine bark media. The cation exchange capacity of the native pine bark growing media was 14 to 95 % lower than that for the composted tea tree media. The use of the composted tea as media for tobacco seedling nursery reduced seed germination by 10 – 37 %, seedling stem height by 4 – 34 %, and seedling stem girth by 6 – 175 %. While the nutrient holding and supplying potential of the growing media in seedling production is important for normal seedling growth, its effect on seedling growth vigor {{is less important than}} that exerted by the presence of suitable physical conditions in the media...|$|R
40|$|Backgorund: People in the Jatihadi village {{are using}} dug wells water which contain high iron level. The average of iron level is 2. 79 mg/l. Appropriate {{technology}} <b>tray</b> aerator with <b>media</b> contacts zeolite and activated carbon {{is the right}} solution to overcome the problems of high Fe content. This study aims to analyze the difference variation the addition of contact <b>media</b> adsorption on <b>tray</b> aerator for dug wells iron level in Jatihadi village, Sumber subdistrict, Rembang regency. Method: The design {{of this study is}} pre experiment research with one group pretest posttest design.   We used Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) method to measure the iron level. Water sample volume for each aeration is 20 liters and there are 16 repetitions. The media that we used in this research is zeolite and activated carbon. Results: The result showed the average levels of iron before treatment is 2. 79 mg/l, and after the first treatment down to 0. 21 mg/l, after second treatment is 0. 25 mg/l. Statistical analysis showed that there is no difference between variation of contact media adsorption for dug wells  iron level, but Wilcoxon analysis showed that there is a significant difference between before and after treatment for adding zeolite or activated carbon. Conclusion: The efficiency of tray aerator with the addition of zeolite is higher than addition of activated carbon...|$|R
5000|$|The front lid {{contains}} two, four, or six tabs to {{keep any}} liner notes in place. The liner notes typically {{will be a}} 120 × 120 mm booklet, or a single 242 × 120 mm leaf folded in half. In addition, there is usually a back card, 150 × 118 mm, underneath the <b>media</b> <b>tray</b> and visible through the clear back, often listing the track names, studio, copyright data and other information. The back card is folded into a flattened [...] "U" [...] shape, with the sides being visible along the ends (often {{referred to as the}} spine) of the case. The ends usually have the name of the release and the artist, and often label or catalogue information printed on them, and are designed to be visible when the case is stored vertically, 'book-style', on shelves.|$|E
