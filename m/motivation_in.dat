5|$|The federal {{government}} was initially lauded for its swift and thorough preparation to which most observers, including the United Nations, attributed Dean's low death toll. However, after the storm there were several accusations of political <b>motivation</b> <b>in</b> the distribution of aid. Members of President Felipe Calderón's Partido Accion Nacional (PAN) distributed bags of bread, funded by the nation's disaster relief coffers, carrying the party's logo. In Veracruz Governor Fidel Herrera was accused by both the PAN and his own Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) of using state resources, including hurricane relief, to support the campaigns of PRI candidates.|$|E
5|$|Tillman was {{the primary}} sponsor of the Tillman Act, the first federal {{campaign}} finance reform law, which was passed in 1907 and which banned corporate contributions in federal political campaigns.

5|$|Hastings was commemorated on {{the stone}} laid below the Petone Anzac Memorial Flagstaff {{by members of the}} New Zealand Railways Department. The {{memorial}} was {{the focal point of the}} first public Anzac Day remembrance ceremony in New Zealand on 25 April 1916, which was attended by the Prime Minister of New Zealand, William Massey, and other members of Parliament. Even though Hastings' death had not been confirmed at the time, it is believed that the desire to commemorate him was a key <b>motivation</b> <b>in</b> the erection of the memorial. Hastings' name is also included on the Memorial Tablet engraved with the names of 446 New Zealand Railways Department workers who were killed during World War I, which was unveiled in the Railways Head Office at Wellington on 28 April 1922 by the Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|In the Emperor's eyes, {{the deaths}} of his sons seemed to presage {{the end of the}} {{imperial}} system. His younger son had represented his future and that of the monarchy. Although the Emperor still had a legal successor in his daughter Isabel, he had little confidence that a woman could rule Brazil in the male-dominated social climate of the time. He did nothing to prepare Isabel for the responsibilities of ascending the throne, nor did he attempt to encourage acceptance of a female ruler among the political class. The lack of a male heir caused him to lose <b>motivation</b> <b>in</b> promoting the imperial office as a position to be carried on by his descendants; he increasingly saw the imperial system as so inextricably linked to himself that it could not survive him.|$|E
5|$|The Cotswold Olimpick Games is {{an annual}} public celebration of games and sports now {{held on the}} Friday after Spring Bank Holiday near Chipping Campden, in the Cotswolds of England. The Games {{probably}} began in 1622, and have continued on and off to the present day. They were started by a local lawyer, Robert Dover, {{with the approval of}} King James. Dover's <b>motivation</b> <b>in</b> organising the Games may have been his belief that physical exercise was necessary for the defence of the realm, but he may also have been attempting to bring rich and poor together; the Games were attended by all classes of society, including royalty on one occasion.|$|E

5|$|The edition {{published}} by Faulkner includes over 500 corrections {{to the original}} text, surpassing any other editions. Faulkner's version also contains over 50 passages that either not present in the original or expanded on from the original text. This has suggested to some critics that the Faulkner edition was a later rework of Gulliver's Travels {{and not just a}} correction to printing related mistakes. The inclusion of these many additions was later seen by critics as part of Swift's disapproval of Motte's versions, but others see Motte's version as being more true to the anti-government spirit of Swift's work, which confuses Swift's <b>motivation</b> <b>in</b> allowing Faulkner to reprint the work.|$|E
5|$|The inaugural Music City bowl {{marked the}} first meeting of Alabama and Virginia Tech on the {{football}} field since 1979, when the No. 1 Crimson Tide defeated Virginia Tech, 317. Prior to the Music City Bowl, Alabama had defeated Virginia Tech in all 10 meetings of the two schools, and some Virginia Tech players cited that record as <b>motivation</b> <b>in</b> the game. For American General, sponsoring the game was part of an overall marketing strategy intended to boost the company's national profile. Spread bettors favored Virginia Tech to win the game by five points. In exchange for appearing in the game, each team received $750,000, minus expenses. Media coverage in {{the weeks leading up to}} the game focused on Virginia Tech's tough defense and Alabama's recovery from NCAA-imposed sanctions.|$|E
5|$|At Christmas 1085, William {{ordered the}} {{compilation}} {{of a survey}} of the landholdings held by himself and by his vassals throughout the kingdom, organised by counties. It resulted in a work now known as the Domesday Book. The listing for each county gives the holdings of each landholder, grouped by owners. The listings describe the holding, who owned the land before the Conquest, its value, what the tax assessment was, and usually the number of peasants, ploughs, and any other resources the holding had. Towns were listed separately. All the English counties south of the River Tees and River Ribble are included, and the whole work seems to have been mostly completed by 1 August 1086, when the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that William received the results and that all the chief magnates swore the Salisbury Oath, a renewal of their oaths of allegiance. William's exact <b>motivation</b> <b>in</b> ordering the survey is unclear, but it probably had several purposes, such as making a record of feudal obligations and justifying increased taxation.|$|E

5|$|The Simpsons uses a {{floating}} timeline {{in which the}} characters do not physically age, and as such the show {{is assumed to be}} set in the current year. In several episodes, events have been linked to specific times, though sometimes this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes. Maggie is the youngest child of Marge and Homer, and sister to Bart and Lisa. When Marge became pregnant with Bart, she and Homer got married at a chapel in Las Vegas. To support his impending family, Homer all but demanded a job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, impressing its owner, Mr. Burns, with his aggressive submissiveness. When Marge became pregnant with Lisa, two years later, she and Homer bought their first house. Another six years later, Homer felt financially secure enough to finally quit his job at the Power Plant and take his dream job at Barney's Bowlarama. However, Marge became pregnant with Maggie, so Homer, once again unable to support his family, was forced to reapply for his old job. By the time Maggie was born, Homer had shown great signs of distress, but he managed to find <b>motivation</b> <b>in</b> the form of his newborn baby girl.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMeeting the user's {{needs is}} {{essential}} in housing delivery. Therefore, designers are required to consider personal <b>motivations</b> <b>in</b> the housing decision making process. The authors consider that Maslow's theory on hierarchy of needs is applicable <b>in</b> explaining user's <b>motivations</b> <b>in</b> housing. The theory indicates that different levels of user's needs imply different levels of housing expectations, hence different house attributes. This paper discusses a theoretical framework developed by the authors to summarize {{the relationship between the}} user's needs and the attributes of housing units. By systematically linking the user's needs to architectural attributes, person-environment congruence (PEC), hence suitability of living environment, will be improved...|$|R
