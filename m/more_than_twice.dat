5|$|Because their {{elliptical}} orbits frequently {{take them}} {{close to the}} giant planets, comets are subject to further gravitational perturbations. Short-period comets have a tendency for their aphelia to coincide with a giant planet's semi-major axis, with the JFCs being the largest group. It is clear that comets {{coming in from the}} Oort cloud often have their orbits strongly influenced by the gravity of giant planets {{as a result of a}} close encounter. Jupiter is the source of the greatest perturbations, being <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>twice</b> as massive as all the other planets combined. These perturbations can deflect long-period comets into shorter orbital periods.|$|E

A series of benchmark tests conducted on the graphics performance of the fourth-generation iPad by Anandtech resulted in the device achieving the highest score compared to other consumer mobile devices, including the Samsung Galaxy S III, Nexus 10 and third-generation iPad. The performance increase of the fourth-generation iPad varies between tests, however an increase is nonetheless evident. Furthermore, battery longevity tests {{conducted by}} the same organization suggests that the battery of the fourth-generation iPad is able to last longer than its predecessor. However, the battery of the updated iPad 2 is able to outlast the fourth-generation iPad.|$|E
