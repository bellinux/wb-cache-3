40|$|This {{scientific}} opinion of EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids {{deals with the}} safety evaluation of the additive 1, 3, 5 -tris(2, 2 -dimethylpropanamido) benzene with the CAS No. 745070 - 61 - 5, the Ref. No 95420, the FCM Substance No 784, {{for use as a}} nucleating agent/clarifier at a <b>maximum</b> <b>use</b> <b>level</b> of 250 mg/kg in polyprolylene (PP). Final articles are intended to be used in contact with all type of foods for short term contact (1 hour) at temperatures up to 100 ºC and/or for long term storage at ambient temperature or below. Specific migration of the substance into 3 % acetic acid, 10 % ethanol and olive oil, was measured to be up to 48 µg/kg, 79 µg/kg and 94 µg/kg, respectively. In vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests showed no evidence for a genotoxic potential of the substance. A 90 -day dietary toxicity study in Wistar rats showed no effects at any dose and the NOAEL was considered to be 961 mg/kg bw/day in males and 1104 mg/kg bw/day in females or higher. Therefore, the CEF Panel concluded that the substance 1, 3, 5 -tris(2, 2 -dimethylpropanamido) benzene does not raise a safety concern for the consumer if it is used in polyolefins and the migration does not exceed 5 mg/kg food...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) was asked {{to deliver an opinion}} on proline-specific oligopeptidase (Tolerase® G) as a novel food {{ingredient}} submitted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 258 / 97 of the European Parliament and of the Council, taking into account the comments and objections of a scientific nature raised by Member States. The novel food is an enzyme preparation of prolyl-oligopeptidase produced with a genetically modified Aspergillus niger self clone strain. The target population is the general adult population. The results from a bacterial reverse mutation test and of an in vitro chromosome aberration test did not indicate genotoxicity. The Panel considers that the reported effects observed in a 90 -day rat study are treatment-related effects and {{can be attributed to the}} higher energy consumption by these animals. Taking into account the intended <b>maximum</b> <b>use</b> <b>level</b> for Tolerase® G, its daily consumption would correspond to 2, 746 mg TOS/person or to 39. 2 mg TOS/kg body weight (bw) per day, when considering a default body weight of 70 kg for an adult person. The margin between this value and the dose in the rats, which caused effects attributable to the excess energy intake, is approximately 45. Noting this margin, the Panel considers that it is unlikely that such effects would occur in human at the intended use levels. The Panel concludes that the NF, Tolerase® G, is safe for the intended use at the intended use level...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} by the European Commission, the Scientific Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Foods (ANS) carried out an {{assessment}} of the dietary exposure to erythritol and concluded on the safety of the proposed use in beverages at a <b>maximum</b> <b>use</b> <b>level</b> of 2. 5 %, taking into account additional exposure data provided to the Panel. Anticipated exposure to erythritol from its use as food additive including soft-drinks containing a mean concentration of 2. 5 % erythritol would be in the range of 0. 004 - 0. 04 g/kg bw/day for toddlers, 0 - 0. 05 g/kg bw/day for children, 0 - 0. 08 g/kg bw/day for adolescents, 0 - 0. 14 g/kg bw/day for adults, and 0 - 0. 01 g/kg bw/day for the elderly. At high level, exposure estimates would be in the range of 0. 29 - 0. 48 g/kg bw/day (toddlers), 0. 13 - 0. 76 g/kg bw/day (children), 0. 04 - 0. 50 g/kg bw/day (adolescents), 0. 05 - 0. 43 g/kg bw/day (adults), and 0. 01 - 0. 25 g/kg bw/day (the elderly). The main categories contributing to the exposure to erythritol were table-top sweeteners and soft drinks for all age groups except toddlers where soft drinks were the only main contributor. The Panel concluded that based on the new data provided on use levels of erythritol in foods and {{on the basis of the}} extension of the authorisation for the use of erythritol to soft drinks at a use level of 2. 5 % the Margin of Safety of 1. 54 is too low to protect children adequately...|$|E

40|$|An {{exposure}} assessment {{was performed to}} estimate the daily intake of benzoates for the Flemish population. Three age groups were considered: preschool children (n = 697; age 2 - 6; 3 -day estimated dietary record), adolescents (n = 341; age 14 - 18; 7 -day estimated dietary record) and women (n = 641; age 18 - 40; 2 -day estimated dietary record). In {{a first step in}} the risk evaluation process as proposed by the European Union, the individual food consumption data were multiplied with the <b>maximum</b> permitted <b>use</b> <b>levels</b> for benzoates per food group. The median (interquartile range) estimated daily intake is, respectively, 2. 0 (1. 0 - 3. 2) mg/kg bw, 1. 7 (1. 1 - 2. 7) mg/kg bw and 1. 92 (1. 3 - 3. 0) mg/kg bw for preschool children, adolescents and adult women. In all age groups, the greatest potential contributor to the total estimated benzoate intake was the group of non-alcoholic flavoured drinks. At respectively the 92 nd percentile (children), the 97 th percentile (adolescents) and the 94 th percentile (women), the accepted daily intake (ADI) of 5 mg/kg bw/day is exceeded slightly. However, this approach, in which the <b>maximum</b> permitted <b>use</b> <b>levels</b> are <b>used</b> is known to overestimate the intake, since not all food items in which benzoates are allowed, contain (the <b>maximum</b> permitted <b>use</b> <b>level</b> of) benzoates.

40|$|This {{scientific}} opinion of EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF Panel) {{deals with the}} risk assessment of the additive tungsten oxide, CAS No 39318 - 18 - 8 and FCM No 1064, for use in food contact materials as a reheat agent in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) at a <b>maximum</b> <b>use</b> <b>level</b> of 75 ppm (75 mg/kg PET). The substance {{is a mixture of}} tungsten oxides with tungsten at different oxidative levels. The average oxidation level of tungsten in the oxides is 2. 86 corresponding to 19. 93 % oxygen content. Detailed information on impurities is provided as confidential. Specific migration from PET plaques with the substance at 150 mg/kg (double the maximum intended use level of 75 mg/kg) was determined into 95 % ethanol, as a worst-case simulant for PET due to its swelling effect. Under these test conditions, the specific migration, measured as tungsten using ICP-MS, was at the level of 1 lg/kg. The Panel considered that due to the insolubility of the substance, this low migration will be typical for any foreseeable use as a reheat additive in PET. Two in vitro genotoxicity studies, a bacterial gene mutation test and an in vitro micronucleus assay, performed in accordance with the OECD Guidelines and in compliance with GLP, were provided by the applicant for the substance tungsten oxide and were considered negative by the CEF Panel. According to a {{scientific opinion}} on strategy for genotoxicity testing (EFSA, 2011), the three genotoxic endpoints, gene mutation, chromosomal and numerical aberrations, are covered by these two tests. The CEF Panel concluded that the substance tungsten oxide is not of safety concern for the consumer if the additive is used as a reheat agent in PET. For other technical functions or for use in other polymers, the migration should not exceed 50 lg/kg (expressed as tungsten) ...|$|E

40|$|Polyols are {{approved}} {{for use as}} sweeteners in specific foods {{but they may be}} used for other technological purposes in a wider range of foods, all on a quantum satis basis. The European Polyols Association (EPA) has identified 24 categories of food where polyols are used and it has been able to establish the levels at which the polyols are used in each type of food and whether for sweetening or non-sweetening purposes. The UK National Dietary and Nutrition survey database was used to estimate potential exposures to total polyols based on reported <b>use</b> <b>levels.</b> It was possible to express potential polyol intake on the basis of exposure relating to a single eating occasion, a meal period, 1 day and the average over 4 days of the survey. Potential intakes of polyols were approximately twice that found on a per-item or a meal-period basis when estimated on a daily basis. Apparent intakes were lower when averaged over the 4 days of the survey. It was felt that intake expressed on a per-meal occasion basis was most relevant to the development of digestive discomfort. On the basis of <b>maximum</b> <b>use</b> <b>levels</b> of polyols in all food categories, adults had the highest intake of total polyols up to 5. 6 g per meal period at the 95 th percentile. However, when expressed on a bodyweight basis, children had higher intakes, up to 0. 15 g kg– 1 bw per meal period. Distributions of potential polyol exposures were highly skewed towards lower values with higher levels of exposure relating to sweetener uses occurring relatively infrequently...|$|R
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF) was {{requested}} to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety assessment of the flavouring substances caffeine [FL-no: 16. 016] and theobromine [FL-no: 16. 032] in the Flavouring Group Evaluation 49, Revision 1. Consequent to the 2015 scientific opinion from the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) on the safety of caffeine from all dietary sources, the CEF Panel considered it inappropriate to evaluate the two substances through the Procedure. For caffeine, the Panel based its assessment on the safety threshold of 5. 7 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day for adults, except pregnant/lactating women, and 3 mg/kg bw per day for children, adolescents, pregnant and lactating women, as established by the NDA Panel. The safety evaluation of theobromine takes into account that approximately 11 % of an oral dose of caffeine is metabolised to theobromine and that both substances have a similar pharmacological profile. For the exposure assessment, a brand loyalty model was chosen. In this model, {{it was assumed that}} a consumer is exposed on a long-term basis to a specific category of food (i. e. non-alcoholic beverages), containing caffeine or theobromine at their respective <b>maximum</b> <b>use</b> <b>levels.</b> For the rest of the categories, normal <b>use</b> <b>levels</b> applied. Daily dietary exposure to caffeine and theobromine (excluding systemic exposure) added as a chemically defined flavouring substance ranged 0 - 2. 3 and 0 - 0. 4 mg/kg bw, respectively, across all population groups. The Panel concluded that caffeine [FL-no: 16. 016] and theobromine [FL-no: 16. 032] would not be expected to present safety concern based on their estimated levels of intake from their use as flavouring substances...|$|R
40|$|The {{food enzyme}} {{considered}} in this opinion is a beta-amylase (EC 3. 2. 1. 2) from soybean submitted by Nagase (Europa) GmbH. This beta-amylase {{is intended to}} be used in the starch processing for maltose syrup production and the manufacture of a Japanese rice cake type. Based on the <b>maximum</b> <b>use</b> <b>levels</b> recommended for the respective food processes, dietary exposure to the food enzyme-total organic solids (TOS) was estimated on the basis of Japanese consumption data. Conservative average infant formula consumption, as reported in the EFSA Draft Guidance on risk assessment of substances present in food intended for infants below 16 weeks of age, was used to estimate the exposure to a fraction of soybean comparable to the food enzyme-TOS, resulting from the consumption of soybeanderived foods. The exposure estimate to the food enzyme-TOS was found to be lower than the comparable fraction from the source material. Potential allergenicity of the beta-amylase was evaluated by searching for similarity of the amino acid sequence to those of known allergens, and no match was found. The b-amylase is produced from soybean, which is a known allergenic food. Japanese rice cake, consequently, may contain traces of soybean allergens, which may give rise to safety concerns in soybean-allergic consumers. Based on the origin of the food enzyme from edible parts of soybean, the manufacturing process, the compositional and biochemical data provided and the dietary intake estimates, the Panel concluded that this food enzyme does not give rise to safety concerns under the intended conditions of use, except that Japanese rice cake produced with this food enzyme may contain traces of soybean allergens...|$|R

40|$|The {{food enzyme}} {{considered}} in this opinion is an endo- 1, 4 -b-xylanase (EC 3. 2. 1. 8) produced with a genetically modified strain of Aspergillus niger. The genetic modifications {{do not give}} rise to safety concerns. The food enzyme contains neither the production organism nor recombinant DNA. The endo- 1, 4 -beta-xylanase {{is intended to be}} used in baking processes. Based on the <b>maximum</b> <b>use</b> <b>levels</b> recommended for the respective food process, dietary exposure to the food enzyme-total organic solids (TOS) was estimated on the basis of individual data from the EFSA Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database. This exposure estimate is below 0. 013 mg TOS/kg body weight (bw) per day in European populations. No safety concerns were identified in relation to the genetic modifications performed, the manufacturing process, the compositional and biochemical data provided, allergenicity and exposure assessments. The allergenicity was evaluated by comparing the amino acid sequence to those of known allergens; no match was found. The Panel considered that the likelihood of allergic reactions to dietary intake of endo- 1, 4 -beta-xylanase is low and, therefore, does not give rise to safety concerns. The systemic toxicity was assessed by means of a repeated dose 90 -day oral toxicity study in rodents. A no observed adverse effect level was derived (4, 095 and 4, 457 mg TOS/kg bw per day for males and females, respectively), which, compared with the dietary exposure, results in a sufficiently high margin of exposure. However, the genotoxicity data were incomplete. Due to the absence of the recommended combination of microbial strains used in the Ames test (i. e. lack of Salmonella Typhimurium TA 102 and Escherichia coli WP 2), no conclusions can be drawn on potential DNA oxidising or cross-linking mechanisms giving rise to gene mutations. Consequently, no final conclusions can be drawn on genotoxicity...|$|R

This The food enzyme considered in this opinion is a 4 -α-D-glucan maltohydrolase (EC 3. 2. 1. 2) obtained from grain of barley (Hordeum vulgare), by the companies Genencor International B. V. and Senson Oy. This β-amylase {{is intended to be}} used in several food-manufacturing processes: baking and brewing processes, distilled alcohol production, and starch processing for the production of glucose syrups. The compositional data provided for the food enzyme were considered sufficient. The manufacturing process did not raise safety concerns. Based on the <b>maximum</b> <b>use</b> <b>levels</b> recommended for the respective food processes, dietary exposure to the food enzyme–total organic solids (TOS) was estimated on the basis of individual data from the EFSA Comprehensive European Food Consumption Database. This exposure estimate is similar to or lower than the exposure to a fraction of barley comparable to the food enzyme– TOS, resulting from the consumption of barley-derived foods. As the food enzyme is derived from edible parts of barley, in line with the requirements of the guidance document on food enzyme assessment, the Panel accepted that {{there was no need for}} the provision of toxicological data for this food enzyme. Barley is known as a gluten-containing cereal; however, the gluten content in the food enzyme was found to be below the detection limit of the applied analytical method and well below the threshold value of 20 mg/kg for ‘gluten-free’ products. Furthermore, the potential allergenicity was evaluated by searching for similarity between the amino acid sequence of β-amylase and the sequences of known food allergens; no match was found. Based on the origin of the food enzyme from edible parts of barley, the enzymemanufacturing process, the compositional and biochemical data provided, the allergenicity and dietary exposure assessment, the Panel concluded that this food enzyme does not give rise to safety concerns under the intended conditions of use...|$|R

At the <b>maximum</b> N <b>use</b> <b>level,</b> sorghum genotypes showed greater N use efficiency (120 kg biomass/kg N harvested) than groundnut genotypes (36 kg biomass/kg N harvested). Using a non-nodulating groundnut genotype (Non-nod) or sorghum as controls for soil N uptake, {{the amounts of}} N 2 fixed by the nodulated groundnut genotypes were estimated to be 183 – 190 kg N/ha. Nitrogen fertilization increased harvest index and percentage N translocated to seeds in sorghum genotypes, but decreased harvest index and had variable effects on percentage N translocated to seed in groundnut genotypes. Leaf nitrate reductase activity (NRA) and nitrate content in the leaves of two sorghum genotypes, one nodulating, and ‘Non-nod’ groundnut genotypes were also compared. The concentration of nitrate was lower in sorghum than in groundnut leaves, but NRA was higher in sorghum. It is suggested that either NRA in the groundnut leaves has relatively lower affinity for the substrate (higher Km, the Michaelis-Menton constant) or higher nitrate {{is required for the}} induction of nitrate reductase in groundnut than in sorghum.

40|$|The {{laboratory}} toxicologist {{is frequently}} {{faced with the}} chal-lenge of selecting appropriate vehicles or developing utilitarian for-mulations for use in in vivo nonclinical safety assessment studies. Although there are many vehicles available that may meet physical and chemical requirements for chemical or pharmaceutical formu-lation, there are wide differences in species and route of adminis-tration specific to tolerances to these vehicles. In current practice, these differences are largely approached on a basis of individual experience as there is only scattered literature on individual vehi-cles and no comprehensive treatment or information source. This approach leads to excessive animal use and unplanned delays in testing and development. To address this need, a consulting firm and three contract research organizations conducted a rigorous data mining operation of control (vehicle) data from studies dating from 1991 to present.

40|$|A low {{screen was}} {{temporarily}} installed alongside an urban road {{to test the}} acoustic performance. Within the on-going project, the screen is an acoustic prototype, whereas later, a screen design will be developed considering also perceived acoustic quality and visual aspects. The current acoustic prototype, built up from concrete modules, was placed beside a small park on the reservation between a two-lane road and a track for walking and cycling. A larger traffic system, of which the two-lane road is a part, determines the daytime equivalent noise level within the urban area. The screen height was about 1. 3 m as measured from {{the level of the}} road surface and the width of the screen top was 0. 3 m. Measurements were carried out both at 20 m distance from the road (within the park) and at 5 m distance from the road (on the cycle track). Insertion loss in <b>maximum</b> <b>level,</b> <b>using</b> controlled light vehicle pass-by at 50 km/h, was measured to 10 dB and 6 dB at 5 and 20 m distance, respectively, at 1. 5 m height. The measured results have been compared with those predicted by both a noise mapping software and a boundary element method, showing reasonable agreement...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMaximum sound {{pressure}} <b>levels</b> are commonly <b>used</b> for environmental noise and building acoustics measurements. This paper investigates the signal processing errors due to Fast or Slow time-weighting detectors {{when combined with}} octave band filters, one-third octave band filters or an A-weighting filter. For 6 th order Butterworth CPB filters the inherent time delay caused by the phase response of filters is quantified using three different approaches to establish the following rules-of-thumb: (1) time-to-gradient/amplitude matching occurs when Bt≈ 1, (2) time-to-peak matching occurs when Bt≈ 2 and (3) time-to-settle matching occurs when Bt≈ 4 for octave band filters, and when Bt≈ 3 for one-third octave band filters. Four different commercially-available sound <b>level</b> meters are <b>used</b> to quantify the variation in measured <b>maximum</b> <b>levels</b> <b>using</b> tone bursts, half-sine pulses, ramped noise and recorded transients. Tone bursts indicate that Slow time-weighting is inappropriate for maximum level measurements due to the large bias error. The results also {{show that there is}} more variation between sound level meters when considering Fast time-weighted maximum levels in octave bands or one-third octave bands than with A-weighted levels. To reduce the variation between measurements with different sound level meters, it is proposed that limits could be prescribed on the phase response for CPB filters and A-weighting filters...|$|R

The cartridge was a co-development between Ruger and Hornady where Ruger developed the rifles and Hornady the ammunition. Compared to the [...]416 Ruger, the Remington cartridge has a greater case capacity and a higher S.A.A.M.I. recommended pressure level. This means that the Remington cartridge should perform better than the Ruger cartrdige. The Hornady's [...]416 Ruger ammunition matches both the Rigby and Remington [...]416 cartridges it does so working close to its <b>maximum</b> pressure <b>level</b> <b>using</b> a specially blended powder unavailable to the public. Those who handload their ammunition will have some difficulty reaching the performance of the factory loaded ammunition while staying within the maximum average pressure rating of the cartridge. Data published by Hornady provide a velocity for the 400 gr g of 2300 ft/s for the [...]416 Ruger, 2400 ft/s for the Rigby, 2450 ft/s for the [...]416 Remington Magnum and 2700 ft/s for the [...]416 Weatherby.|$|R
