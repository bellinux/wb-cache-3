Additionally, Nakamurella <b>multipartite,</b> currently {{part of the}} order Frankiales, also formed a clade with the Pseudonocardiaceae species in 100% of the bootstrap replications of the phylogenetic trees. A conserved signature indel has been identified which is found in N. <b>multipartite</b> and {{all but one of}} the Pseudonocardiaceae species. This one-amino-acid insertion in UMP kinase serves to both provide a molecular marker for nearly all of the Pseudonocardiaceae and suggests N. <b>multipartite</b> is closely related to this group. Some evidence also suggests the orders Pseudonocardiales and Corynebacteriales are closely related. Several conserved signature indels have been identified which are found in both Pseudonocardiales and Corynebacteriales, including a three-amino-acid insertion in a conserved region of UDP-galactopyranose mutase. This insertion is also present in N. <b>multipartite</b> and Geodermatophilus obscurus, another member of Frankiales. Additionally, five conserved signature proteins have been identified which are found only in the Pseudonocardiales and Corynebacteriales orders. Homologs of the proteins are generally found in N. <b>multipartite</b> and G. obscurus, providing additional evidence of these two species being closely related to the orders Pseudonocardiales and Corynebacteriales.|$|E

Thus, in general the entanglement of a pure state is described by the spectra of the reduced density matrices of all bipartite partitions: the state is genuinely -partite entangled if and only if all bipartite partitions produce mixed reduced density matrices.|$|E

A complete <b>multipartite</b> graph is a graph that is complete k-partite for some k.The Turán graphs are the special case of complete <b>multipartite</b> graphs in which each two independent sets differ in size by at most one vertex.Complete k-partite graphs, complete <b>multipartite</b> graphs, and their complement graphs, the cluster graphs, are special cases of cographs, and can be recognized in polynomial time even when the partition is not supplied as part of the input.|$|E
