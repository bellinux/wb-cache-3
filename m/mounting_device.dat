50|$|Revere, {{starting}} {{probably in}} the 1950s, also produced a fairly high quality rotary tool {{very much like the}} Dremel tools now on the market. The Revere-O-Matic was a 0.55 ampere model that operated at 15,000 r.p.m. (Model No. RG-1). All the tools that attached to it via the chuck can be used with today's Dremel models. The standard package also came with a table <b>mounting</b> <b>device</b> and a system for enabling creation of identical objects, also adaptable to today's Dremel with no modification required.|$|E

5000|$|Signals {{are most}} {{commonly}} mounted on trackside masts about 12 ft to 15 ft high {{to put them}} in the eyeline of the engineer. Signals can also be mounted on signal bridges or cantilever masts spanning multiple tracks. Signal bridges and masts typically provide at least 20 ft of clearance {{over the top of the}} rail. Bracket masts are arranged with multiple signals are mounted on the same masts governing two adjacent tracks. Bracket masts tend to be the tallest type of signal to allow the train crew to see the signal over a train on the intervening track. Signals in electrified territory may be mounted on the catenary structure, and signals on bi-directional lines may be mounted back-to-back on the same <b>mounting</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E
40|$|A robotic {{device for}} {{remotely}} inspecting pressurizer heater wells is provided {{which has the}} advantages of quickly, precisely, and reliably acquiring data at reasonable cost while also reducing radiation exposure of an operator. The device comprises a probe assembly including a probe which enters a heater well, gathers data regarding {{the condition of the}} heater well and transmits a signal carrying that data; a <b>mounting</b> <b>device</b> for mounting the probe assembly {{at the opening of the}} heater well so that the probe can enter the heater well; a first motor mounted on the <b>mounting</b> <b>device</b> for providing movement of the probe assembly in an axial direction; and a second motor mounted on the <b>mounting</b> <b>device</b> for providing rotation of the probe assembly. This arrangement enables full inspection of the heater well to be carried out...|$|E

40|$|Silicon {{and diamond}} monochromators (crystals), {{often used in}} the Advanced Photon Source X-ray beamlines, require a good quality surface finish and {{stress-free}} installation to ensure optimal performance. The device used to mount the crystal {{has been shown to}} be a major contributing source of stress. In this case, an adjustable <b>mounting</b> <b>device</b> is an effective method of reducing stresses and improve the rocking curve to levels much closer to ideal. Analysis by a topography test unit has been used to determine the distribution of stresses and to measure the rocking curve, as well as create CCD images of the crystal. This paper describes the process of measuring these stresses and manipulating the <b>mounting</b> <b>device</b> and crystal to create a substantially improved monochromator...|$|E
