5|$|Despite these lean performances, Karthik was {{retained}} for the three-Test {{series at}} home to Pakistan in March. In a high-scoring draw in the First Test in Mohali, Karthik <b>made</b> <b>only</b> six as India amassed 516. Karthik then put on his best Test batting performance to this point, at Eden Gardens, Kolkata against Pakistan. India batted first and Karthik made a start and reached 28, before being run out. India made 407 and Pakistan almost broke even, replying with 393. In the second innings, Karthik scored, combining with Rahul Dravid in a 166-run partnership {{to set up a}} target of 422. This proved too much for the tourists on the deteriorating pitch and India won the match by 196 runs. In the next match, he <b>made</b> <b>only</b> 10 and 9 as India collapsed and lost ten wickets {{on the final day of}} an otherwise high-scoring match1280 runs had been scored for only 22 wickets in the first three innings.|$|E
5|$|Due to his {{international}} commitments, Kartik <b>made</b> <b>only</b> sporadic appearances {{during the}} Indian domestic scene in 2007–08.

5|$|Harvey had a poor {{season in}} 195556. He scored only 37 runs in six {{completed}} innings {{in the first}} three matches. In the next match against Western Australia, he <b>made</b> <b>only</b> 8 in the first innings but scored 70 not out in the second innings as his team’s run-chase petered away to a draw, and he retained his position in the team. He then made 17 and 28 in the next match against South Australia, run out in the latter innings after making a start.

5|$|Harvey {{played against}} an {{international}} outfit {{for the first}} time in the following match against the touring England cricket team, but <b>made</b> <b>only</b> three in his solitary innings. However, he continued to score consistently, making a half-century in each of the next three matches. From the third of these matchesagainst South Australiaonwards, he generally opened the batting for Queensland. On his first innings back as an opener, he narrowly missed a century, being dismissed for 95 by Geff Noblet. However, it was enough for the Queenslanders to take a 162-run first innings lead in a low-scoring match in which only one team surpassed 240 once, and set up an eight-wicket victory, the only time his state won a match for the season. Harvey’s performance tapered away in the last two matches of the season. He <b>made</b> <b>only</b> 0 and 2 in the last match against Victoria, and 48 runs in his last four innings.|$|E
