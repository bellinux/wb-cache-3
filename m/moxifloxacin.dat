25|$|About 52% of an oral or {{intravenous}} dose of <b>moxifloxacin</b> is metabolized via glucuronide and sulfate conjugation. The cytochrome P450 {{system is not}} involved in <b>moxifloxacin</b> metabolism, and is not affected by <b>moxifloxacin.</b> The sulfate conjugate (M1) accounts for around 38% of the dose, and is eliminated primarily in the feces. Approximately 14% of an oral or {{intravenous dose}} is converted to a glucuronide conjugate (M2), which is excreted exclusively in the urine. Peak plasma concentrations of M2 are about 40% those of the parent drug, while plasma concentrations of M1 are, in general, less than 10% those of <b>moxifloxacin.</b>|$|E
25|$|In vitro {{studies with}} {{cytochrome}} (CYP) P450 enzymes indicate that <b>moxifloxacin</b> does not inhibit 80 CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP1A2, suggesting that <b>moxifloxacin</b> {{is unlikely to}} alter the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized by these enzymes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Moxifloxacin</b> is also {{considered}} to be contraindicated within the pediatric population, pregnancy, nursing mothers, patients {{with a history of}} tendon disorder, patients with documented QT prolongation, and patients with epilepsy or other seizure disorders. Coadministration of <b>moxifloxacin</b> with other drugs that also prolong the QT interval or induce bradycardia (e.g., beta-blockers, amiodarone) should be avoided. Careful consideration should be given in the use of <b>moxifloxacin</b> in patients with cardiovascular disease, including those with conduction abnormalities.|$|E
25|$|The {{half-life}} of <b>moxifloxacin</b> is 11.5-15.6 hours (single-dose, oral). About 45% of an oral or {{intravenous dose}} of <b>moxifloxacin</b> is excreted as unchanged drug (about 20% in urine and 25% in feces). A total of 96 ± 4% of an oral dose is excreted as either unchanged drug or known metabolites. The mean (± SD) apparent {{total body clearance}} and renal clearance are 12 ± 2L/h and 2.6 ± 0.5L/h, respectively. The CSF penetration of <b>moxifloxacin</b> is 70% to 80% in patients with meningitis.|$|E
25|$|No uses {{within the}} {{pediatric}} population for oral and intravenous <b>moxifloxacin</b> have been approved. A {{significant number of}} drugs found within this class, including <b>moxifloxacin,</b> are not licensed by the FDA for use in children due {{to the risk of}} permanent injury to the musculoskeletal system.|$|E
25|$|<b>Moxifloxacin</b> was {{subsequently}} (ten years later) {{approved by the}} FDA {{for use in the}} United States in 1999. At least four additional United States patents have been filed regarding <b>moxifloxacin</b> hydrochloride since the 1989 United States application, as well as patents outside of the USA.|$|E
25|$|<b>Moxifloxacin</b> is also {{manufactured}} by Alcon as Vigamox.|$|E
25|$|<b>Moxifloxacin</b> is not {{believed}} {{to be associated with}} clinically significant drug interactions due to inhibition or stimulation of hepatic metabolism. Thus, it should not, for the most part, require special clinical or laboratory monitoring to ensure its safety. <b>Moxifloxacin</b> has a potential for a serious drug interaction with NSAIDs.|$|E
25|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>moxifloxacin</b> in pediatric subjects {{have not}} been studied.|$|E
25|$|Several reports {{suggest the}} use of <b>moxifloxacin</b> may lead to uveitis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Moxifloxacin</b> is {{approved}} {{for the treatment}} of conjunctival infections caused by susceptible bacteria.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of corticosteroids and <b>moxifloxacin</b> has increased potential {{to result in}} tendonitis and disability.|$|E
25|$|Regulatory {{agencies}} have taken actions to address certain rare but serious adverse events associated with <b>moxifloxacin</b> therapy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Moxifloxacin</b> {{should be}} used with caution in {{patients}} suffering from diabetes, as glucose regulation may be significantly altered.|$|E
25|$|<b>Moxifloxacin</b> is used {{to treat}} a number of infections, including: {{respiratory}} tract infections, cellulitis, anthrax, intraabdominal infections, endocarditis, meningitis, and tuberculosis.|$|E
25|$|The first {{generation}} is rarely used. Frequently prescribed drugs are Avelox (<b>moxifloxacin),</b> Cipro (ciprofloxacin), Levaquin (levofloxacin), and, to some extent, their generic equivalents.|$|E
25|$|If treated early {{antibiotics}} {{for eight}} weeks are effective in 80% of people. This often includes the medications rifampicin and streptomycin. Clarithromycin or <b>moxifloxacin</b> are sometimes used instead of streptomycin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Moxifloxacin,</b> cefepime, tigecycline, and {{ertapenem}} do {{not appear}} to be effective in vitro. Piperacillin-sulbactam, doripenem and biapenem appear to be effective in vitro, but no clinical experience exists on which to recommend their use.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, the FDA {{added two}} box {{warnings}} for this drug {{in reference to}} spontaneous tendon ruptures {{and the fact that}} <b>moxifloxacin</b> may cause worsening of myasthenia gravis symptoms, including muscle weakness and life-threatening breathing problems.|$|E
25|$|Fluoroquinolones have varying {{specificity}} for cytochrome P450, and so {{may have}} interactions with drugs cleared by those enzymes; the order from most P450-inhibitory to least, is enoxacin > ciprofloxacin > norfloxacin > ofloxacin, levofloxacin, trovafloxacin, gatifloxacin, <b>moxifloxacin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rare but serious {{adverse effects}} {{that may occur}} {{as a result of}} <b>moxifloxacin</b> therapy include {{irreversible}} peripheral neuropathy, spontaneous tendon rupture and tendonitis, hepatitis, psychiatric effects (hallucinations, depression), torsades de pointes, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and Clostridium difficile-associated disease, and photosensitivity/phototoxicity reactions.|$|E
25|$|Bayer is {{currently}} running a phase II clinical trial {{in collaboration with}} the TB Alliance to evaluate shorter treatment regimens for TB; encouragingly, Bayer have also promised that if the trials are successful, Bayer will make <b>moxifloxacin</b> affordable and accessible in countries that need it.|$|E
25|$|Antacids {{containing}} aluminium or magnesium ions {{inhibit the}} absorption of <b>moxifloxacin.</b> Drugs that prolong the QT interval (e.g., pimozide) may have an additive effect on QT prolongation and lead to increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias. The international normalised ratio may be increased or decreased in patients treated with warfarin.|$|E
25|$|If {{people are}} treated early, {{antibiotics}} {{for eight weeks}} are effective in 80%. The treatment often includes the medications rifampicin and streptomycin. Clarithromycin or <b>moxifloxacin</b> are sometimes used instead of streptomycin. Other treatments may include cutting out the ulcer. After the infection heals, the area typically has a scar.|$|E
25|$|Though {{not stated}} as such within the package insert, {{ziprasidone}} is also {{considered to be}} contraindicated, as it may {{have the potential to}} prolong QT interval. <b>Moxifloxacin</b> should also be avoided in patients with uncorrected hypokalemia, or concurrent administration of other medications known to prolong the QT interval (antipsychotics and tricyclic antidepressants).|$|E
25|$|<b>Moxifloxacin</b> {{was first}} {{patented}} (United States patent) in 1991 by Bayer A.G., {{and again in}} 1997. Avelox was subsequently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{for use in the}} United States in 1999 to treat specific bacterial infections. Ranking 140th within the top 200 prescribed drugs in the United States for 2007, Avelox generated sales of $697.3 million worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{can include}} topical steroids to {{diminish}} the inflammation. Antibiotics {{to diminish the}} proportion of aerobic bacteria is still a matter of debate. The use of local antibiotics, preferably local non-absorbed and broad spectrum, covering enteric gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes, can be an option. In some cases, systemic antibiotics can be helpful, such as amoxicillin/clavulanate or <b>moxifloxacin.</b> Vaginal rinsing with povidone iodine can provide relief of symptoms but does not provide long-term reduction of bacterial loads. Dequalinium chloride can also be an option for treatment.|$|E
25|$|If {{patients}} are discovered to be infected with an isoniazid-resistant strain of TB having completed 2 months of HREZ, {{then they should}} be changed to RE for a further 10 months, {{and the same thing}} if the patient is intolerant to isoniazid (although 2REZ/7RE may be acceptable if the patient is well supervised). The US recommendation is 6RZE with the option of adding a quinolone such as <b>moxifloxacin.</b> The level of evidence for all these regimens is poor, and there is little to recommend one over the other.|$|E
25|$|Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone {{secretion}} (SIADH) in turn can {{be caused}} by a number of problems. Some forms of cancer can cause SIADH, particularly small cell lung carcinoma but also a number of other tumors. A variety of diseases affecting the brain or the lung (infections, bleeding) can be the driver behind SIADH. A number of drugs has been associated with SIADH, such as certain antidepressants (serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants), the anticonvulsant carbamazepine, oxytocin (used to induce and stimulate labor), and the chemotherapy drug vincristine. It has also been associated with fluoroquinolones (including ciprofloxacin and <b>moxifloxacin).</b> Finally, it can occur without a clear explanation. Hyponatremia can be treated pharmaceutically through the use of vasopressin receptor antagonists.|$|E
