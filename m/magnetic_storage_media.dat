Iron(II) oxide also exists, though it is unstable at room temperature. Despite their names, they are actually all non-stoichiometric compounds whose compositions may vary. These oxides are the principal ores for the production of iron (see bloomery and blast furnace).

50|$|Erasure via {{degaussing}} may {{be accomplished}} in two ways: in AC erasure, the medium is degaussed by applying an alternating field that is reduced in amplitude over time from an initial high value (i.e., AC powered); in DC erasure, the medium is saturated by applying a unidirectional field (i.e., DC powered or by employing a permanent magnet).

50|$|At {{that time}} {{it was clear that the}} vast {{expansion}} of atomic data could no longer be adequately disseminated by print publications alone. Many NIST data publications had been converted to <b>magnetic</b> <b>storage</b> <b>media,</b> which could be purchased from the NIST Standard Reference Data Program. In the early 1990s, perceiving the potential of the World Wide Web, Martin persuaded NIST management to allow free distribution of NIST atomic data on the internet.

5000|$|... common uses of <b>magnetic</b> <b>storage</b> <b>media</b> are for {{computer}} data mass storage on hard disks and {{the recording of}} analog audio and video works on analog tape. Since much of audio and video production is moving to digital systems, the usage of hard disks {{is expected to increase}} at the expense of analog tape. Digital tape and tape libraries are popular for the high capacity data storage of archives and backups. Floppy disks see some marginal usage, particularly in dealing with older computer systems and software. Magnetic storage is also widely used in some specific applications, such as bank cheques (MICR) and credit/debit cards (mag stripes).|$|E
50|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>storage</b> <b>media</b> can be {{classified}} as either sequential access memory or random access memory, although {{in some cases the}} distinction is not perfectly clear. The access time can be defined as the average time needed to gain access to stored records. In the case of magnetic wire, the read/write head only covers a very small part of the recording surface at any given time. Accessing different parts of the wire involves winding the wire forward or backward until the point of interest is found. The time to access this point depends on how far away it is from the starting point. The case of ferrite-core memory is the opposite. Every core location is immediately accessible at any given time.|$|E

Initial measurements of the adsorption of water during exposure to water vapor indicate that at room temperature and moderate humidity levels (∼ 50 % RH) the amount of water on a surface is of the order of one adsorbed monolayer.

5000|$|Magnetic multilayers: Nano-wires {{consisting}} of alternating magnetic/nonmagnetic layers act as magnetic sensors. As an example, cobalt/copper nanowires are obtained from an electrolyte containing both metals. At low voltage, pure copper is deposited while cobalt resists electro-deposition. At high voltage, both metals are deposited as an alloy. If the electrolyte contains predominantly cobalt, a magnetic cobalt-copper alloy is deposited {{with a high}} fraction of cobalt. The electrical conductivity of the multilayer wire depends on the applied external magnetic field. The magnetic order of the cobalt layers increases with the applied field. Without magnetic field, neighboring magnetic layers prefer the anti-parallel order. With magnetic field, the magnetic layers prefer the orientation parallel with the magnetic field. The parallel orientation corresponds to a reduced electrical resistance. The effect is used in reading heads of <b>magnetic</b> <b>storage</b> <b>media</b> (the [...] "GMR effect").|$|E
50|$|Self-assembly of {{nanoscale}} structures from functional nanoparticles {{has provided}} a powerful path to developing small and powerful electronic components. In the recent decade, it has been confirmed that organic compounds can be conductors or semiconductors. In addition to insulator, one of the opportunities in nanomaterials science is to use organic synthesis and molecular design to make electronically usefully structures starting with organic molecules. The difficulty of applied nanostructure material is nanoscale objects have always been difficult to work with because they cannot be characterized by molecular techniques and they {{are too small to}} see optically. 2D self-assembly monodisperse particle colloids has a strong potential in dense <b>magnetic</b> <b>storage</b> <b>media.</b> Each colloid particle has the ability to store information as known as binary number 0 and 1 after applying it to a strong magnetic field.

40|$|Ion {{implantation}} {{and thermal}} processing {{can be used}} to create a variety of single-element or compound ferro-magnetic nanocrystals embedded in dielectric host materials. This approach leads to the formation of nanocomposites with several attractive characteristics for potential applications in <b>magnetic</b> data <b>storage</b> <b>media.</b> A number of problems must be addressed before such applications can be realized in practice, however. One difficulty lies in the exercise of sufficiently fine control over the magnetic and microstructural properties of interest. Here, we show that Co nano-crystals produced by the ion implantation of Al 2 O 3 can be formed either as spheroidal or well faceted single-crystal precipitates, depending on the synthesis conditions. Subsequent ion irradiation of the nanoparticles can alter the mi-crostructure and internal chemistry of the particles {{as well as that of}} the host matrix, thereby providing a means of increasing the coercive field of the Co nanoparticles by almost two orders of magnitude...|$|R
50|$|The main {{challenge}} in designing <b>magnetic</b> information <b>storage</b> <b>media</b> is {{to retain the}} magnetization of the medium despite thermal fluctuations caused by the superparamagnetic limit. If the thermal energy is too high, there may be enough energy to reverse the magnetization in a region of the medium, destroying the data stored there. The energy required to reverse the magnetization of a magnetic region {{is proportional to the}} size of the magnetic region and the magnetic coercivity of the material. The larger the magnetic region is and the higher the magnetic coercivity of the material, the more stable the medium is. Thus, there is a minimum size for a magnetic region at a given temperature and coercivity. If it is any smaller it is likely to be spontaneously de-magnetized by local thermal fluctuations. Perpendicular recording uses higher coercivity materials because the head's write field penetrates the medium more efficiently in the perpendicular geometry.|$|R
40|$|As {{the data}} storage density in cutting edge microelectronic devices {{continues}} to increase, the superparamagnetic effect poses {{a problem for}} <b>magnetic</b> data <b>storage</b> <b>media.</b> One strategy for overcoming this obstacle {{is the use of}} thermomechanical data storage technology. In this approach, data is written by a nanoscale mechanical probe as an indentation on a surface, read by a transducer built into the probe, and then erased by the application of heat. An example of such a device is the IBM millipede, which uses a polymer thin film as the data storage medium. It is also possible, however, to use other kinds of media for thermomechanical data storage, and in the following work, we explore the possibility of using thin film Ni-Ti shape memory alloy (SMA). Previous work has shown that nanometer-scale indentations made in martensite phase Ni-Ti SMA thin films recover substantially upon heating. Issues such as repeated thermomechanical cycling of indentations, indent proximity, and film thickness impact the practicability of this technique. While there are still problems to be solved, the experimental evidence and theoretical predictions show SMA thin films are an appropriate medium for thermomechanical data storage...|$|R
