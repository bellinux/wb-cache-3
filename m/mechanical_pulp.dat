25|$|Some ghost towns have revived {{their economies}} and populations due to {{historical}} and eco-tourism, such as Barkerville. Barkerville, once the largest town north of Kamloops, {{is now a}} year-round provincial museum. In Quebec, Val-Jalbert is a well-known tourist ghost town; founded in 1901 around a <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> mill that became obsolete when paper mills began to break down wood fibre by chemical means, it was abandoned when the mill closed in 1927 and re-opened as a park in 1960.|$|E
25|$|The first {{pulp mill}} along Tistaelva was Søndre Skåningsfossen Træsliberi, {{established}} by Christian Anker in 1867. This operated profitably {{and was able}} to capitalize on much of the otherwise low-value refuse from the sawmills. Saugsbrugforeningen started considering the possibility of building its own pulp mill in 1872. Declining pulp prices from 1874 caused the company to shelve the plans for the meantime. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> mill opened in 1889 with five grinders and annual production of 11,000 tonnes, employing sixty people. The pulp mill was the company's until then largest investment, financed through a loan of 1.25 million Norwegian krone.|$|E
25|$|PM1 and PM2 were rebuilt, while PM3 {{received}} an overhaul and minor upgrades. The TMPs were also upgraded, allowing the original <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> mill from the 1960s {{to be shut}} down. By 1992 Fiborgtangen received ninety-eight percent of its fibers from TMP, cutting the use of cellulose to two percent. A new debarking plant was installed, allowing logs to be debarked in full length. The lumber harbor was filled in and lumber storage was moved to land, where they were more easily accessible. Wood choppings were stored heaps, easing access. The paper storage and docks were expanded, and a new wing {{was added to the}} office building. NT90 allowed total production to increase from 400,000 to 500,000 tonnes annually.|$|E
50|$|The {{two major}} classifications of pulp are {{chemical}} and <b>mechanical.</b> Chemical <b>pulps</b> formerly used a sulphite process, but the kraft process is now predominant. Kraft pulp has superior strength to sulphite and <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulps.</b> Both chemical <b>pulps</b> and <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> may be bleached {{to a high}} brightness.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Mechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> yields {{almost a}} tonne of pulp per tonne of dry wood used, {{which is why}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> are {{sometimes}} referred to as [...] "high yield" [...] pulps. With almost twice the yield as chemical <b>pulping,</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> is often cheaper. Mass-market paperback books and newspapers tend to use mechanical papers. Book publishers tend to use acid-free paper, made from fully bleached chemical pulps for hardback and trade paperback books.|$|R
50|$|The annual Arne Asplund <b>Mechanical</b> <b>Pulping</b> Award, was {{established}} in 1985 to commemorate Asplund’s contributions to the pulp and paper industry.|$|R
2500|$|Negotiations {{with the}} Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Agriculture {{commenced}} in January 1959. One issue which {{lay in the}} air was that the government might want to instead establish a government-owned mill, similar to Norsk Jernverk which had recently opened. The ministries gave a preliminary support to the forest owners' proposal, allowing funding for further investigations. This ultimately led to Nordenfjell Commission being established on 19 June 1959. It had three members each from the government, forest owners and the forest industry. The commission was set to consider the mill's location, the amount of lumber it needed, processing techniques as well and financing and ownership issues. A pulp [...] mill was considered, based on recently abandoned proposals for one in Kirkenes, a site found to be too remote. The commission recommended unanimously on 27 January 1961 that the mill be organized as a cooperative, that it receive one paper machine with an annual output of 100,000 tonnes, a <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> mill with an annual production of 80,000 tonnes and 20,000 tonnes of pulp produced through the sulfite process.|$|E
50|$|Wood-free {{paper is}} paper created {{exclusively}} from chemical pulp rather than <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulp.</b> Chemical pulp is normally made from pulpwood, {{but is not}} considered wood {{as most of the}} lignin is removed and separated from the cellulose fibers during processing, whereas <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> retains most of its wood components and can therefore still be described as wood. Wood-free paper is not as susceptible to yellowing as paper containing <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulp.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{arrival of}} the Canadian National Railway in 1893 stimulated the growth of Chicoutimi's pulp and paper industries, {{particularly}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> production. The Chicoutimi Pulp Co. was founded in 1896 backed by French-Canadian investors. The Chicoutimi Pulp Mill became the biggest producer of <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> in Canada by 1910.|$|E
40|$|Corrected {{steady-state}} fluorescence emission {{spectra of}} various <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> and celluloses were measured using an excitation wavelength of 320 nm. Regardless of its source, cellulose displayed {{a relatively high}} characteristic emission. The emission spectra of <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> were red-shifted with respect to that of cellulose, and peak shapes were influenced by the pulping process, by hydrogen peroxide bleaching and by monochromatic UV irradiation of the sheets. Changes in emission spectra due to bleaching or UV-irradiation occurred principally in the 370 - 440 and 500 - 550 nm regions, and were similar to changes in reflectance spectra reported in the literature. Fluorescence emission spectra of commercial lignins and lignin model compounds were blue-shifted with respect to <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulps,</b> even upon absorption of the fluorophores on solid substrates. Concentration and inner filter effects were evident in emission spectra of commercial lignins, at concentrations as low as 60 ppm. These results suggest that, to a first approximation, emission spectra of <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> may {{be interpreted as a}} decrease in emission of cellulose caused by light absorption by lignin; changes due to bleaching and irradiation may be attributed to changes in lignin absorption...|$|R
50|$|While {{the results}} are the same, the {{processes}} and fundamental chemistry involved in bleaching chemical pulps (like kraft or sulfite) {{are very different from}} those involved in bleaching <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> (like stoneground, thermomechanical or chemithermomechanical). Chemical pulps contain very little lignin while <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> contain most of the lignin that was present in the wood used to make the pulp. Lignin is the main source of color in pulp due to the presence of a variety of chromophores naturally present in the wood or created in the pulp mill.|$|R
40|$|When {{producing}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> the fibre separation {{will take}} place in the weakest part of the wood matrix. A prerequisite to swelling in wood and <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> is that the wood matrix is softened. The position of where the weakest part of the wood matrix is situated can to a large extent be controlled by adjustment of the swelling and softening properties of each of the wood polymers (lignin, hemicelluloses and cellulose). Most probably the efficiency of the external and internal fibrillation of the fibre walls is also influenced by how the swelling and softening properties are controlled. The combination of position of fibre-fibre separation together with the efficiency of the external and internal fibrillation will to a large extent determine the energy demand to produce <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulps.</b> Refining of wood chips with different state of softening and swelling will give rise to fibres with different optical and physical properties. The most important parameters that influence the wood matrix and wood fibres’ ability to swell are temperature, pH, ionic form of and the amount of charged groups in the hemicelluloses and lignin of the cell walls. In order to improve the level of knowledge on how to influence the degree of wood matrix and fibre wall swelling of <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> we have undertaken to study the swelling properties of wood and fibres produced by means of different <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> processes. It was found that pulps not containing sulphonic acid groups need to be heated above the softening temperature of lignin {{in order to be able}} to swell to their full capacity. Introduction of sulphonic acid groups also opens up the rigid structure of lignin which lowers the softening temperature and increases the swelling potential even at lower temperatures. The effect of valence of the counter ion was also shown to be more pronounced after adding more carboxylic acid groups to a pulp. Depending on the number and type of anionic acid groups in the fibres, high-yield pulps will have different combinations of properties in different ionic conditions. The preliminary conclusions from this study are that the ability to control swelling properties of <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> is an important feature to take into account when producing pulp and paper...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, market forces necessitated {{a change in}} product, and between 1981-1982 the mill was {{converted}} from <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> to thermo <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> for a budget of $30 million. Five refiners were added, three chip pre-heaters and two chip washes. The initial refiners were converted to 'secondaries'.|$|E
50|$|With {{the arrival}} of the Canadian National Railway in 1893, the local pulp and paper {{industries}} expanded, particularly in <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> production. The Chicoutimi Pulp Co. was founded in 1896 and backed by French-Canadian investors. By 1910 the Chicoutimi Pulp Mill became the biggest producer of <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> in Canada.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> retains {{most of the}} lignin {{present in}} the wood {{used to make the}} pulp and thus contain almost as much lignin as they do {{cellulose}} and hemicellulose. It would be impractical to remove this much lignin by bleaching, and undesirable since one of the big advantages of <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> is the high yield of pulp based on wood used. Therefore, the objective of bleaching <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> (also referred to as brightening) is to remove only the chromophores (color-causing groups). This is possible because the structures responsible for color are also more susceptible to oxidation or reduction.|$|E
50|$|Fine {{papers are}} {{printing}} and writing paper grades based mainly on chemical pulps. Normally {{the content of}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> are below 10% {{and the amount of}} fillers in the range 5-25%.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the process}} of <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulping,</b> [...] "grinding" [...] and [...] "refining" [...] are the two main methods used to create the pulp. Grinding is the method of {{pressing}} logs and chips against a turning stone to produce fibers. Refiner pulping is treating wood chips with chemicals or heat and then crushing the objects between two disks, {{one or both of}} which are rotating. There are four main types of refiner pulping, which includes refiner <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulping,</b> thermo-mechanical pulping, chemi-mechanical pulping, and chemithermomechanical pulping. Further descriptions of each process are contained in this link:Mechanical pulping, when compared to chemical pulping, is relatively inexpensive and has a high pulp yield (85-95%). However, the paper created is generally weak since it retains the lignin.|$|R
40|$|In {{the area}} of photoyellowing of <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulps,</b> {{recently}} obtained experimental evidence has shown that hydroquinone/p-quinone redox couple is present in lignin-rich <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulps.</b> It was also noted that compared to a control pulp the concentration of p-quinones was significantly higher in a photoyellowed pulp. Under ambient conditions, upon exposure to light, the existent pulp hydroquinones were converted to p-quinones. To further investigate the importance of hydroquinone/p-quinone redox couple in photoyellowing, studies of methylhydroquinone and methyl-p-quinone were carried out Based on presently reported as well as previously published research, it is shown that the hydroquinone/p-quinone redox system can successfully explain most of the observations related to photoyellowing. Consequently, the hydroquinone/p-quinone redox couple plays a highly significant role in pulp photoyellowing...|$|R

40|$|Biopulping, as {{developed}} at Forest Products Laboratory (FPL), involves treating wood chips {{from a common}} pulpwood species with a white-rot fungus prior to pulping. The fungal treatment decreases <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> energy, significantly increases paper strength properties, and lowers brightness, but has minimal effect on other optical properties. Fifty-ton chip pile trials have shown biopulping to be commercially feasible. Current technology is based on using specialized equipment to steam chips for surface sterilization, inoculating with a lignin-degrading (white-rot) fungus, and aerating the chips during a two-week incubation prior to pulping. In separate studies at FPL and the University of Washington, small-diameter softwood trees from the Colville National Forest, Washington, were found suitable for chemical and <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulping.</b> The small-diameter tree species are {{an alternative to the}} commonly used pulpwood species. Biopulping was not included in that investigation. We biopulped small-diameter softwood and aspen, for comparative purposes, using wild-type isolates of Ceriporiopsis subvermispora and Phanerochaete chrysosporium and a genetically altered strain of Phanerochaete chrysosporium. Results showed that refiner <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> of lodgepole pine and aspen chips treated with wild-type or genetically modified strains generally saved electrical energy, improved pulp properties, and improved paper strength properties. Genetic manipulation of P. chrysosporium substantially enhanced biopulping performance relative to the parental wild-type strain...|$|R
50|$|Sodium {{dithionite}} (Na2S2O4), {{also known}} as sodium hydrosulfite, is the other main reagent used to brighten <b>mechanical</b> <b>pulps.</b> In contrast to hydrogen peroxide, which oxidizes the chromophores, dithionite reduces these color-causing groups. Dithionite reacts with oxygen, so efficient use of dithionite requires that oxygen exposure be minimized during its use.|$|R

50|$|Pan Pac was {{established}} by Carter Consolidated Ltd, a family business {{which was founded in}} 1896, a predecessor to Carter Holt Harvey. By 1967, the Auckland-based timber company was researching ways to utilise timber waste from its forestry and sawmill operations.

It became clear that an economic pulp mill would require more wood than the company could provide from waste.
