A shift register of 1024 master-slave flip-flops has been fabricated in 28 nm FDSOI technology in order to study the <b>minimum</b> <b>operating</b> voltage {{with respect to a}} wide back bias range allowed by the FDSOI technology. We show that a maximum yield is obtained for an optimum back bias couple (VBP for PMOS, VBN for NMOS) resulting from a tradeoff between speed and currents ratios. Results are given for a chain of 1, 16, 128, and 1024 FFs in series as well as for two different temperatures (30 C and 80 C). The <b>minimum</b> <b>operating</b> voltage of 1024 FFs is 230 mV at 30 C for a back biasing of (VBP,VBN) = (- 0. 5 V, 0. 5 V) and 299 mV at 80 C with (VBP,VBN) = (0 V, 0 V) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{manuscript}} presents {{simulation results}} of energy dissipation in sub-threshold (sub-VT) of various 16 -bit adder structures. The architectures {{designed for the}} comparative experiments are, a bit-serial, an 8 -bit digit-serial and a 16 -bit parallel adder structures. The designs are synthesized in a 65 nm low-leakage high-threshold CMOS technology. The results show that an energy <b>minimum</b> <b>operating</b> voltage exists for all the three implementations, however the 8 -bit digit serial has the least energy <b>minimum</b> <b>operating</b> point. The advantage of the bit-serial structure is that by employing this technique we may save 88 % area when compared to parallel implementation and 66 % area when compared to digital-serial implementation...|$|R

40|$|Drivers’ speeds were {{recorded}} on 32 tangent-curve-tangent configurations of four two-lane rural roads {{implemented in the}} CRISS (Inter-University Research Center for Road Safety) driving simulator. 147 driving tests {{were used for the}} analysis in order to verify if: a) the midpoint of the tangent and the midpoint of the curve are the most appropriate locations for speed data collection to evaluate the speed differential through the subtraction of operating speed on two locations; b) the speed differential obtained by the subtraction of the maximum operating speed on the last 200 m of the tangent and the <b>minimum</b> <b>operating</b> speed on the curve is significantly different from the 85 th-percentile of the distribution of maximum speed reduction experienced by each driver. The results were the following. The maximum operating speed on the last 200 m of the tangent (V 85 max_ 200) is higher than the operating speed at the midpoint of the tangent. The operating speed in the midpoint of the curve overestimates the <b>minimum</b> <b>operating</b> speed on curve (V 85 min,c). A relationship between the point along the curve where the <b>minimum</b> <b>operating</b> speed is achieved and the geometric features of the tangent-curve transition was defined. Speed differential obtained using V 85 max_ 200 and V 85 min,c tends to underestimate the amount of speed reduction experienced by the drivers. Predicting models of the maximum operating speed on the last 200 m of the tangent, of the <b>minimum</b> <b>operating</b> speed on curve and of the 85 th-percentile of the distribution of maximum speed reduction experienced by each driver were developed...|$|R

40|$|Ultra-low {{sub-threshold}} voltage {{research has}} become increasingly important with the recent shift in consumer electronics towards low power designs for mobile, wearable, and implantable technologies. These applications are able to trade-off speed for reduced power consumption and reduced <b>minimum</b> <b>operating</b> voltage. This thesis studies circuit design solutions that focus on achieving the lowest <b>minimum</b> <b>operating</b> voltages. These applications {{are likely to be}} ones where the supply voltage may come from energy harvesting sources that are only able to source ultra-low voltages. The logic circuit presented in this thesis is a modified implementation of differential cascade voltage switch logic (DCVSL). Differential logic has improved ultra-low voltage performance over static CMOS logic and the modification to DCVSL offers a logic structure that can implement multi-input AND/NAND and OR/NOR gates while maintaining a stack height of one. This logic circuit is referred in this thesis as MOD-DCVSL. The modification requires the use of capacitive boosting to allow for normal logic operation. The results of this thesis show that differential logic styles are able to perform at lower <b>minimum</b> <b>operating</b> voltages compared to static CMOS logic styles but at the cost of larger delay and power compared to static CMOS. On average the differential implementations could <b>operate</b> at a <b>minimum</b> supply voltage 5 mV lower than CMOS for two input implementations and 10 mV lower for three input implementations. The delay of differential implementations was approximately double for both two and three input implementations. The power of the differential implementations are approximately 20 % higher than static CMOS for two input implementations but this gap is narrowed to approximately 10 % for three input implementations, here the lower <b>minimum</b> <b>operating</b> voltages allowed for decreased power consumption. Due to the consistently lower delay, static CMOS had a lower power delay product than the differential logic. When comparing only the differential logic, MOD-DCVSL offered negligible difference for two input implementations but was able to improve delay by 7 % and power by 11 % in the three input implementations...|$|R
