5|$|The high {{population}} of the asteroid belt makes for a very active environment, where collisions between asteroids occur frequently (on astronomical time scales). Collisions between main-belt bodies with a <b>mean</b> <b>radius</b> of 10km are expected to occur about once every 10 million years. A collision may fragment an asteroid into numerous smaller pieces (leading {{to the formation of}} a new asteroid family). Conversely, collisions that occur at low relative speeds may also join two asteroids. After more than 4 billion years of such processes, the members of the asteroid belt now bear little resemblance to the original population.|$|E

25|$|The Odysseus crater is now quite {{flat for}} its size of {{approximately}} 450km or more precisely, its floor conforms to Tethys' spherical shape. This {{is most likely}} due to the viscous relaxation of the Tethyan icy crust over geologic time. The floor lies approximately 3km below the <b>mean</b> <b>radius,</b> while its exterior rim is about 5km above the mean radius—the relief of 6–9km is not very high for such a large crater. Inside the crater the rim is composed of arcuate scarps and extends for about 100km until the floor is reached. There are several graben radiating away from Odysseus, which are 10–20km wide and hundreds of kilometers long. They {{are likely to be}} cracks in the crust created by the impact.

The observed oblateness corresponds to a rotation period of 10 hours, not to the 79 days observed. A possible explanation for this is that the shape of Iapetus was frozen by formation of a thick crust shortly after its formation, while its rotation continued to slow afterwards due to tidal dissipation, until it became tidally locked.|$|E
40|$|Approach {{images taken}} by the LORRI imaging system during the New Horizons {{spacecraft}} encounter {{have been used to}} determine the <b>mean</b> <b>radii</b> and shapes of Pluto and Charon.

The resulting <b>mean</b> <b>radii</b> of Pluto and Charon are 1188. 3 +/- 1. 6 km and 606. 0 +/- 1. 0 km, respectively (2 -sigma). The corresponding densities are 1854 +/- 11 kg m- 3 and 1701 +/- 33 kg m- 3 (2 -sigma). The Charon radius value is consistent with previous Earth-based occultation estimates. The Pluto radius estimate is consistent with solar occultation measurements performed by the ALICE and Fine Sun Sensor instruments on New Horizons.
