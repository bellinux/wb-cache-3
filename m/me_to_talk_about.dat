500|$|Laich {{is a hard}} worker, and {{dedicated}} to his team, saying, [...] "If I asked you about your family, you would talk about them forever because it's something you love. That's the way I feel about this team. This team is my life, and I love playing here and I'm passionate about playing hockey. So it's easy for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it." [...] Boudreau has said, [...] "You {{are never going to}} find a guy that cares more than Brooks Laich." [...] Laich spends time in the off-season with a power skating instructor, which he feels is key to a long career.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song refer to vampires and werewolves: [...] "Run run her kiss is a vampire grin/The moon lights her way while she's howlin' at him". Gaga {{explained}} that the lines were means of expressing how people rely on external motivations to cope with internal anxiety. [...] "She doesn't feel free without the moon," [...] Gaga said. [...] "These lyrics are a way for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> how I believe women and some men feel innately insecure about themselves all the time. It's not sometimes, it's not in adolescence, it's always." [...] The spoken interlude refers to famous people who met with a tragic end of their lives, namely Marilyn Monroe, Judy Garland, Sylvia Plath, JonBenét Ramsey, Liberace, Jesus, Stanley Kubrick, and Princess Diana.|$|E
500|$|In 1982, {{an investigative}} {{reporter}} named Gary Moore from the St. Petersburg Times drove from the Tampa area to Cedar Key looking for a story. When he commented to a local on the [...] "gloomy atmosphere" [...] of Cedar Key, and questioned why a Southern town was all-white when {{at the start of}} the 20th century it had been nearly half black, the local woman replied, [...] "I know what you're digging for. You're trying to get <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> that massacre." [...] Moore was hooked. He was able to convince Arnett Doctor to join him on a visit to the site, which he did without telling his mother. Moore addressed the disappearance of the incident from written or spoken history: [...] "After a week of sensation, the weeks of January 1923 seem to have dropped completely from Florida's consciousness, like some unmentionable skeleton in the family closet".|$|E

2500|$|Demosthenes is also {{implicated in}} passive {{homosexuality}} and the prostitution of youth: [...] "There {{is a certain}} Aristion, a Plataean..., who as a youth was outstandingly good-looking and lived {{for a long time}} in Demosthenes' house. Allegations about the part he was playing [...] there vary, and it would be most unseemly for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E
2500|$|After his songwriting {{contributions}} {{were rejected}} from the band's previous album, 1986's Somewhere in Time, Dickinson felt that his role within the band had diminished, as he [...] "just became the singer," [...] but felt renewed enthusiasm when Harris explained the concept to him; [...] "I thought, 'What a great idea! Brilliant!' And of course I was really chuffed, too, because he'd actually rung <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it {{and ask me}} if I had any songs that might fit that sort of theme. I was like, 'Well, no, but {{give me a minute}} and I'll see what I can do.'" [...] Speaking about the record in later years, however, Dickinson remarked that [...] "we almost did [...] ", explaining that, [...] "it was only half a concept album. There was no attempt to see it all the way through, like we really should have done. Seventh Son... has no story. It's about good and evil, heaven and hell, but isn't every Iron Maiden record?" ...|$|E

You don't know much of my son, my dear; but you know enough of him, I dare say, to recollect him?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In January 2008, {{the media}} {{reported}} that Patel and Bhatt broke their five-year relationship. Bhatt confirmed the break-up {{in a conversation}} with Mid-Day. Shortly afterwards, Patel's parents explained their willingness to reconcile with their daughter and that [...] "everybody is happy about the break-up" [...] but their relationship remained strained. On 12 March 2008, Patel was spotted with London-based businessman Kanav Puri at Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week. In June 2008, she confirmed their relationship in an interview with Mid-Day: [...] "I did not admit to Kanav sooner because he's very special and I did not want to jinx it. It was too precious for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it to people. It's almost six months now and now I am feeling secure and now I know our relationship is too strong for anything or anyone to come between us." [...] The media once reported that she got married to Puri but she denied these rumours.|$|E
2500|$|Elton {{says of his}} {{criticism}} [...] "I would have loved a honeymoon period, but I've been irritating journos from the beginning. Originally I was knocked for being too left-wing, and now apparently I've sold out and I'm too right-wing, but all the time I've been being me, and that certainly isn't the person I recognise in anything that's written about me." [...] He denies being anti-establishment though, [...] "I wrote a sitcom for the BBC when I was 21! [...] How the fuck can I be anti-establishment? From the first interview I ever did, I talked about Morecambe and Wise, and every time they wanted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> Lenny Bruce I'd say, 'Yeah, he's fine, but he doesn't make me laugh the way Eric 'n' Ernie do." [...] He also points out he was a socialist {{at a time when}} [...] "the media was on the whole slavishly worshipping of Thatcher". He said of his political views [...] "I believe in the politics of Clement Attlee. I'm a Welfare State Labour voter." ...|$|E

I am beginning to feel terribly egotistical already." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot {{remember}} how we drifted into this very personal argument.

6000|$|It {{seemed a}} kind of mournful {{serenity}} came over his face. [...] "You say you are going away"; he whispered, pointing with his finger, [...] "and yet you expect <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> that." ...|$|E
