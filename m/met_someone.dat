25|$|There are early {{hints that}} Seishirō {{may not be}} all that he appears. Hokuto jokes about him {{being a member of}} the family of Sakurazukamori, a clan of assassins who use onmyōjitsu to kill, and are {{pronounced}} to be the Sumeragis' opposite. Also, Subaru has dreams about having <b>met</b> <b>someone</b> under a cherry tree blooming out of season when he was but a small child, but he cannot quite recall what was being said. This person was actually Seishirō, upon whom Subaru stumbled when he had just performed a kill. According to the rules of the Sakurazukamori, Seishirō should have killed him, but impressed with the child's purity, he made a bet with him instead: He would meet Subaru again, and would then spend one year with him, protecting him and trying to love him. If, at the end of that year, he felt something for Subaru which distinguished him from a thing he could easily destroy, as he could not with any other person, then he would not kill him. To recognize him, he marked him with inverted pentagrams on both hands, the sign of the Sakurazukamori's prey. These marks are for most of the story hidden beneath the gloves Subaru continually wears on the direction of his grandmother, the previous family head, who recognized the marks and so hopes to conceal them with her magic.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to his racial stereotyping, from his early years, Hergé was openly critical of racism. He lambasted the pervasive racism of United States society in a prelude comment to Tintin in America published in Le Petit Vingtième on 20 August 1931, and ridiculed racist attitudes toward the Chinese in The Blue Lotus. Peeters asserted that [...] "Hergé was no more racist than the next man", an assessment shared by Farr, who after meeting Hergé in the 1980s commented that [...] "you couldn't have <b>met</b> <b>someone</b> who was more open and less racist". In contrast, President of the International Bande Dessinée Society Laurence Grove opined that Hergé adhered to prevailing societal trends in his work, and that [...] "When it was fashionable to be a Nazi, he was a Nazi.

He began performing in arthouse clubs and coffeehouses such as Al's Bar and Raji's. In order to keep indifferent audiences engaged in his music, Beck would play in a spontaneous, joking manner. [...] "I'd be banging away on a Son House tune and the whole audience would be talking. So maybe out of desperation or boredom, or the audience's boredom, I'd make up these ridiculous songs just to see if people were listening," [...] he later remarked. Virtually an unknown to the public and an enigma to those who met him, Beck would hop onstage between acts in local clubs and play [...] "strange folk songs", accompanied by [...] "what could best be described as performance art" [...] while sometimes wearing a Star Wars stormtrooper mask. Beck <b>met</b> <b>someone</b> who offered to help record demos in his living room, and he began to pass cassette tapes around.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 20th and early 21st centuries, several campaigners and writers characterised Tintin in the Congo as racist {{due to its}} {{portrayal}} of the Congolese as infantile and stupid. According to Tom McCarthy, Hergé depicted the Congolese as [...] "good at heart but backwards and lazy, in need of European mastery." [...] There had been no such controversy when originally published, because it was only following the Wind of Change and decolonisation, which occurred during the 1950s and 1960s, that Western attitudes towards indigenous Africans shifted. Harry Thompson argued that one must view Tintin in the Congo {{in the context of}} European society in the 1930s and 1940s, and that Hergé had not written the book to be [...] "deliberately racist". He argued that it reflected the average Belgian view of Congolese people at the time, one that was more [...] "patronising" [...] than malevolent. Jean-Marie Apostolidès supported this idea, as did biographer Benoît Peeters, who asserted, [...] "Hergé was no more racist than the next man." [...] After meeting Hergé in the 1980s, Farr commented, [...] "You couldn't have <b>met</b> <b>someone</b> who was more open and less racist." ...|$|E
50|$|Addu Bas is {{also quite}} {{different}} from the official form of the Maldivian language and has some affinities with Mulaku Bas. In the past, Addu Atoll being a centre of Education, the islanders from the three atolls of the south who acquired education from the atoll used the Addu Bas as their lingua franca. Hence, when for example one of these islanders of any of the Huvadhu islands <b>met</b> with <b>someone</b> from Fuvahmulah, they would use Addu Bas to talk to each other. Addu Bas is the most widespread of the dialects of Maldivian. However, the secessionist government of the Suvadives (1959-1963) used Malé Bas in its official correspondence.|$|R

[...] This perception seems confirmed by an associate of al-Ani's who suggested to a reporter that the Czech informant had mistaken another man for Atta.

50|$|Under this conception, a moral agent {{could be}} {{negatively}} free {{to take a}} holiday in Miami, because no-one is forcing them not to (condition 1 is met); but not really free to do so, because they cannot afford the flight (condition 2 is not <b>met).</b> Similarly, <b>someone</b> could be negatively free to swim across the English Channel; but not really free, {{because they are not}} a good enough swimmer and {{would not be able to}} succeed in the task.

500|$|... "Like a Virgin" [...] {{was written}} by Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly. The idea for the song {{originated}} when Steinberg was living at his father's vineyards in the Coachella Valley, and driving a red pickup truck one day. In {{an interview with the}} Los Angeles Times, Steinberg explained that the song was not written for Madonna or any female singer but was inspired by his personal experiences. At that time Steinberg had just come out of an emotionally challenging relationship, and he had <b>met</b> <b>someone</b> new. That inspired the lyrics for [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] about how he coped with the difficult situation. When he took the song to Kelly, they decided {{that it would be a}} sensitive ballad, however they could not decide how the word [...] "virgin" [...] would fit in it. Steinberg elaborated: [...] "I wasn't just trying to get that racy word virgin in a lyric. I was saying ... that I may not really be a virgin— I've been battered romantically and emotionally like many people— but I'm starting a new relationship and it just feels so good, it's healing all the wounds and making me feel like I've never done this before, because it's so much deeper and more profound than anything I've ever felt." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Brian {{has been}} out of town {{attending}} a seminar on creating a web series and is unaware of what has transpired. On his way home, Brian stops at the Marriott, meets Ida, and starts having drinks with her. Quickly bonding, they retire to Ida's room for sex, with Ida leaving first, then Brian after telling the barman to bill the drinks to her room. The next morning, Brian shares his newfound love with Peter and Lois before showing them a picture of Ida on his cellphone. Peter and Lois go into hysterics, while Brian, unaware of Ida's operation, believes they are just jealous. After Stewie tells him that Quagmire's father has had a sex change and reveals Ida's name, Brian realizes that he has had sex with Quagmire's transgendered father and vomits for almost 30 uninterrupted seconds before the two of them panic. At the same time, Ida returns to Quagmire's home and apologizes, and Quagmire returns the favor, reconciling their relationship. Ida tells Quagmire that she <b>met</b> <b>someone,</b> and when she says it was Brian, whom Quagmire despises, he becomes furious. Brian is traumatized for no reason after finding out about Ida and, when he hears Quagmire come inside the house, he tries to hide under Peter and Lois' bed, but Quagmire finds him easily, because Brian's feet were sticking out from under the bed, and brutally beats him, thus threatening to blow his head off if he goes near Quagmire's house. Brian gets the final word — [...] "Hey, I fucked your dad." [...] — and angrily slams the door shut.|$|E

[...] U2 lyrics usually have several possible levels of interpretation, and it is not always possible to definitively ascribe Hewson's influence upon them, but music writer Niall Stokes believes that inspiration from Hewson is pronounced throughout the group's 1997 album Pop, particularly on [...] "Staring at the Sun", which he believes reflects her Chernobyl Children's Project involvement and the feelings of both danger and hopefulness that it triggered in Bono. Stokes also believes that the 2000 song [...] "When I Look at the World" [...] is an explicit acknowledgement of Hewson's strength and commitment as exemplified by that Chernobyl work, while others think it is about Jesus or God. Bono has seemed to deflect those interpretations, saying that song is in part a hard-edged look at himself from the eyes of one losing faith. In any case, Bono has said that he does not feel constrained in his writing or interviews by what Hewson might think, as [...] " [...] doesn't read newspapers. Or listen to the radio. There's a mysterious distance between us." [...] Not known for being musical herself, Hewson did perform Lady Gaga's [...] "Telephone", as a duet with her husband, to serenade their daughter Eve at her 21st birthday celebration at a club in Las Vegas in 2012.|$|E

Besides, according to whether the alternatives must be arranged on scales, additive {{particles are}} further divided into simple inclusion additive particles (henceforth, additive particles) and scalar additive particles (henceforth, scalar particles).

For example, also in 27 asserts that the focused property met Mary applies to the subject Jenny (i.e., Jenney has the property of meeting Mary) and presupposes that at least one alternative property, such as met Bill, is possessed by Jenny.

40|$|Mobility {{data are}} {{inherently}} uncertain due to several contributing {{factors related to}} different phases of their life cycle, from acquisition to interpretation. When data are processed, uncertainty propagates to intermediate and final results. Thus, {{it is important to}} be aware of uncertainty in trajectory data and explicitly account for it in their modeling and managing. For example, consider a simple scenario where people move around a city and disclose their positions twice an hour; to avoid stalking, the disclosed position is randomly selected from inside a circle with a radius of one kilometer, which contains the position of the user. Not being aware of uncertainty could lead to inconsistent conclusions. For instance, we could erroneously assume that a group of people have <b>met</b> or that <b>someone</b> has visited a privacy-sensitive place. On the contrary, taking uncertainty into account, we can avoid such erroneous conclusions; for example, if someone was farther than one kilometer from the place of an accident, we can certainly assume that this person was not involved in that accident. We next introduce a well-known taxonomy of uncertainty (see Bibliographic Notes section), aimed at clearly defining terms that are often given multiple meanings in the literature. A Taxonomy of Uncertainty The taxonomy we present here considers, at the highest abstraction level, that uncertainty in mobility and geographic information is caused by the complexity of the system conformed by three kinds of entities: human being, earth (i. e. geographic/moving), and computing machinery.
