40|$|This book {{presents}} {{the most recent}} advances in the research and applications of reconfigurable <b>mechanisms</b> <b>and</b> robots. It collects 93 independently reviewed papers presented at the Third ASME/IFToMM International Conference on Reconfigurable <b>Mechanisms</b> <b>and</b> Robots (ReMAR 2015) held in Beijing, China, 20 - 22 July 2015. The conference papers are organized into seven parts to cover the reconfiguration theory, topology, kinematics and design of reconfigurable mechanisms including reconfigurable parallel mechanisms. The most recent results on reconfigurable robots are presented including their analysis, design, simulation <b>and</b> control. Bio-inspired <b>mechanisms</b> are also explored in the challenging fields of rehabilitation and minimally invasive surgery. This book further addresses deployable <b>mechanisms</b> <b>and</b> origami-inspired <b>mechanisms</b> <b>and</b> showcases {{a wide range of}} successful applications of reconfigurable <b>mechanisms</b> <b>and</b> robots. Advances in Reconfigurable <b>Mechanisms</b> <b>and</b> Robots II should be of interest for researchers, engineers and postgraduate students in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science and mathematics. ...|$|R

5|$|An FAA {{official}} {{requested a}} face-to-face meeting with Cooper aboard the aircraft, which was denied.

5|$|Cylinders {{should not}} be left {{standing}} unattended unless secured {{so that they can}} not fall in reasonably foreseeable circumstances as an impact could damage the cylinder valve <b>mechanism,</b> <b>and</b> conceivably fracture the valve at the neck threads. This is more likely with taper thread valves, and when it happens most of the energy of the compressed gas is released within a second, and can accelerate the cylinder to speeds which can cause severe injury or damage to the surroundings.|$|E

5|$|The P90 uses an {{internal}} hammer striking <b>mechanism</b> <b>and</b> a trigger mechanism with a three-position rotary dial fire control selector, {{located at the}} foot of the trigger. The dial has three settings: S– safe, 1– semi-automatic fire, and A– fully automatic fire. When set on A, the P90's fire selector provides a two-stage trigger operation similar to that of the Steyr AUG assault rifle—pulling the trigger back slightly produces semi-automatic fire, and pulling the trigger fully to the rear produces fully automatic fire.|$|E

In 2004, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) used miniature television cameras attached to falcons and goshawks to obtain live footage, and today some researchers, enthusiasts and artists similarly deploy crittercams with various species of animals.|$|E

5|$|The {{death of}} Drusus {{elevated}} Sejanus, {{at least in}} Tiberius's eyes, who thereafter refers to him as his 'Socius Laborum' (Partner of my labours). Tiberius had statues of Sejanus erected throughout the city, and Sejanus {{became more and more}} visible as Tiberius began to withdraw from Rome altogether. Finally, with Tiberius's withdrawal in AD26, Sejanus was left in charge of the entire state <b>mechanism</b> <b>and</b> the city of Rome.|$|E

5|$|The {{function}} of aposematism {{is to prevent}} attack, by warning potential predators that the prey animal has defences such as being unpalatable or poisonous. The easily detected warning is a primary defence <b>mechanism,</b> <b>and</b> the non-visible defences are secondary. Aposematic signals are primarily visual, using bright colours and high-contrast patterns such as stripes. Warning signals are honest indications of noxious prey, because conspicuousness evolves in tandem with noxiousness. Thus, the brighter and more conspicuous the organism, the more toxic it usually is.|$|E

5|$|Topoisomerases {{introduce}} both single- and double-strand {{breaks in}} the course of changing the DNA's state of supercoiling, which is especially common in regions near an open replication fork.

5|$|A gritter, {{also known}} as a sander, salt {{spreader}} or salt truck, is found on most winter service vehicles. Indeed, the gritter is so commonly seen on winter service vehicles that the terms are sometimes used synonymously. Gritters are used to spread grit (rock salt), onto roads. The grit is stored in the large hopper on the rear of the vehicle, with a wire mesh over the top to prevent foreign objects from entering the spreading <b>mechanism</b> <b>and</b> hence becoming jammed. The salt is generally spread across the roadway by an impeller, attached by a hydraulic drive system to a small onboard engine. However, until the 1970s, the grit was often spread manually using shovels by men riding {{on the back of the}} truck, and some older spreading mechanisms still require grit be manually loaded into the impeller from the hopper.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} gaseous or highly {{volatile}} brominated halomethane compounds are non-toxic and make superior fire suppressant agents by this same <b>mechanism,</b> <b>and</b> are particular effective in enclosed spaces such as submarines, airplanes, and spacecraft. However, they are expensive and their production and use {{has been greatly}} curtailed due to their effect as ozone-depleting agents. They are no longer used in routine fire extinguishers, but retain niche uses in aerospace and military automatic fire-suppression applications. They include bromochloromethane (Halon 1011, CH2BrCl), bromochlorodifluoromethane (Halon 1211, CBrClF2), and bromotrifluoromethane (Halon 1301, CBrF3).|$|E

Bradner helped to develop {{a wide range of}} technology needed for the bomb, including research on the high explosives and exploding-bridgewire detonators needed to implode the atomic bomb, developed the bomb's triggering <b>mechanism,</b> <b>and</b> even helped design the new town around the laboratory.
