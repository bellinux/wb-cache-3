5000|$|The text {{describes}} {{the manner in}} which medieval masons used a [...] "single dimensional unit" [...] to produce a ground plan for a pinnacle that would be used in the construction of churches and cathedrals. At a time when there was no internationally agreed upon standard of measurement, medieval masons would define a square as a <b>modular</b> <b>unit</b> and then treat it in various ways, translating it or subdividing it, to give other relative measurements in a process called [...] "constructive geometry" [...] to create an effective local standard of measurement. Similar instructions are found in another period publication by Hans Schmuttermeyer of Nuremberg.|$|E

50|$|The {{idea was}} to make one {{particularly}} common instruction, the procedure call, extremely easy to implement in the compilers. Almost all computer languages use a system known as an activation record or stack frame for each procedure—a <b>modular</b> <b>unit</b> of execution—that contains the address from which the procedure was called, the data (parameters) that were passed in, and space for any result values {{that need to be}} returned. In the vast majority of cases these frames are small, typically with three or fewer inputs and one or no outputs (and sometimes an input is reused as an output). In the Berkeley design, then, a register window was a set of several registers, enough of them that the entire procedure stack frame would most likely fit entirely within the register window.|$|E

5000|$|Alamethicin {{biosynthesis}} is {{hypothesized to}} be catalyzed by alamethicin synthase, a Nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) first isolated in 1975. Although {{there are several}} sequences of the alamethicin peptide accepted, evidence suggests these all follow the general NRPS mechanism [...] with small variations at select amino acids. Beginning with the acylation of the N terminal of the first aminoisobutiric acid on the ALM synthase enzyme by Acetyl-CoA, {{this is followed by}} the sequential condensation of amino acids by each <b>modular</b> <b>unit</b> of the synthetase. Amino acids are initially adenylated by an “adenylylation” (A) domain before being attached by a thioester bond to an Acyl Carrier Protein-like Peptidyl carrier protein. The growing chain is attached to the amino acid bearing PCP by the [...] "condensation" [...] (C) domain, followed by another round of the same reactions by the next module. Assembly is completed by the addition of phenylalaninol, an unusual amino acid-like substrate. Following addition of phenylalaninol the completed peptide chain is cleaved by the thioesterase domain, cleaving the thioester bond and leaving an alcohol.|$|E
