5|$|About {{a talent}} for composition... I can say nothing as yet. You have tried your powers too little... Yes, one can study on one's own. Sometimes one needs advice, but one must study... All of us, that is, I <b>myself</b> and Borodin, and Balakirev, and {{especially}} Cui and Mussorgsky, did disdain these things. I consider <b>myself</b> lucky that I bethought <b>myself</b> in time and forced <b>myself</b> to work. As for Balakirev, owing to his insufficient technique he writes little; Borodin, with difficulty; Cui, carelessly; and Mussorgsky, sloppily and often incoherently.|$|E

5|$|Looking 4 <b>Myself</b> was {{predicted}} to sell 120,000 – 130,000 units during its first-week in the United States, based upon first day sales. The figure was under-weight compared to his previous effort Raymond vs. Raymond (2010), which sold 329,000 units {{during the same}} period and to date has sold over two million copies worldwide. Despite the low figure estimation, Looking 4 <b>Myself</b> was still expected to top the Billboard 200 chart on the week ending June 17, 2012, and did so with 128,000 first-week copies sold domestically. The album marks Usher's fourth consecutive number one studio album in the United States. The following week of the album's release, Looking 4 <b>Myself</b> dropped to number six on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 48,000 copies. In its third week, the album again dropped positions, falling three spots to number nine, selling 36,000 units. In its fourth week, Looking 4 <b>Myself</b> fell to number fifteen, and in its fifth week rose to number fourteen, selling 20,178 copies. As of October 2014, Looking 4 <b>Myself</b> has sold 504,000 copies in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Minimal pronouns require {{closeness}} to a vP, often with an embedded possessive. An embedded v would {{start with a}} relative pronoun in specifier position, which would later {{be followed by a}} bound variable interpretation. Locality domains for reflexives are first determined by the proximity of indexicals, <b>myself,</b> to v. Previously thought of as indexicals, the subject pronoun <b>myself</b> can be instead attributed to being bound pronouns connected to the closest v.|$|E

With the entire heavenly court as my witness, I choose you this day for my Mother.

25|$|Babel's last {{recorded}} {{words in}} the proceedings were, 'I am innocent. I have never been a spy. I never allowed any action against the Soviet Union. I accused <b>myself</b> falsely.

25|$|Back on Broadway, Arthur {{continued}} {{to appear in}} small plays that received little attention. Critics, however, {{continued to}} praise her in their reviews. It {{has been argued that}} in this period, Arthur developed confidence in her acting craft for the first time. On the contrast between films in Hollywood and plays in New York, Arthur commented:I don't think Hollywood {{is the place to be}} yourself. The individual ought to find herself before coming to Hollywood. On the stage I found <b>myself</b> to be in a different world. The individual counted. The director encouraged me and I learned how to be <b>myself....</b> I learned to face audiences and to forget them. To see the footlights and not to see them; to gauge the reactions of hundreds of people, and yet to throw <b>myself</b> so completely into a role that I was oblivious to their reaction.|$|E
