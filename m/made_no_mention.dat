5|$|To {{ensure that}} Citizen Kanes {{influence}} from Hearst's {{life was a}} secret, Welles limited access to dailies and managed the film's publicity. A December 1940 feature story in Stage magazine compared the film's narrative to Faust and <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>mention</b> of Hearst.|$|E
5|$|Coandă and his 1910 {{aircraft}} {{were absent}} from much of aviation {{literature of the}} day. None of the annual issues of Jane's All the World's Aircraft ever mentioned the Coandă-1910 or its turbo-propulseur powerplant. The Soviet engineer Nikolai Rynin <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>mention</b> of Coandă in his exhaustive nine-volume encyclopaedia on jet and rocket engines, written in the late 1920s and early '30s.|$|E

5|$|During the Chancellery project, the pogrom of Kristallnacht took place. Speer <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>mention</b> {{of it in}} {{the first}} draft of Inside the Third Reich, and it was only on the urgent advice of his {{publisher}} that he added a mention of seeing the ruins of the Central Synagogue in Berlin from his car.|$|E
5|$|In mid-May, {{three of}} Bundy's Washington State DES coworkers, {{including}} Carole Ann Boone, {{visited him in}} Salt Lake City and stayed for a week in his apartment. Bundy subsequently spent a week in Seattle with Kloepfer in early June and they discussed getting married the following Christmas. Again, Kloepfer <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>mention</b> of her multiple discussions with the King County Police and Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office, and Bundy disclosed neither his ongoing relationship with Boone nor a concurrent romance with a Utah law student known in various accounts as Kim Andrews or Sharon Auer.|$|E
5|$|One British soldier, Bradley Tinnion, {{was killed}} in the operation. Another twelve {{soldiers}} were injured, one seriously. The British Ministry of Defence (MoD) did not officially acknowledge the involvement of special forces, issuing a press release which <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>mention</b> of the SAS, but when it was made public that Brad Tinnion was a Lance Bombardier originally from 29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery, it became clear to experts that Tinnion had been serving with special forces. Operation Barras was Tinnion's first operational deployment as an SAS trooper.|$|E
2500|$|English-language {{media outlets}} in Australia downplayed the event, major {{newspapers}} such as The Sydney Morning Herald and Daily Telegraph {{of the following}} day <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>mentions</b> of the event despite both containing articles on the Tibetan unrests, while television broadcasts reported only the Sydney protest (failing to mention the march in Melbourne) and significantly fewer participants: about 1000 according to Australian state-owned broadcaster, the ABC or only [...] "several hundred" [...] according to Channel Nine; Channel Nine also stated that the demonstration was concerned only about disruptions to the Olympic torch relay, rather than the primary stated target of media bias in the portrayal of the entire Tibet-related episode.|$|R

5|$|Donna Lee Brien {{stated that}} just as the filmmakers {{attempted}} {{to distance themselves from}} Leigh's murder, the city of Newcastle attempted to distance itself from Blackrock. A 1999 feature in The Sydney Morning Herald discussing cinematic production in Newcastle mentioned everything from Mel Gibson's 1977 debut film Summer City to a short film festival that year, but <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>mention</b> of Blackrock. Brien theorised that some of the condemnation the film received may have been due to public frustration with the legal system, as the film achieves justice for the victim, whereas no one was ever convicted of raping Leigh. Brien cited the film as an example of why sensitivity and care must be taken when fictionalising an actual crime.|$|E
5|$|Nickel, {{formerly}} {{used in the}} cent, now had {{no place}} in American coinage. This was unsatisfactory to Wharton, who sought its return. Although Pollock <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>mention</b> of further nickel coinage in his 1864 annual report, Wharton in April of that year published a pamphlet proposing that all non-precious metal coinage be composed of 75% copper and 25% nickel. The copper-nickel cents had contained only 12% nickel, and even so had been difficult for the Mint to strike due to the hardness of the metal, the use of which damaged equipment and quickly broke dies. An alloy of 25% nickel {{would be even more}} difficult to coin. Wharton argued that the tough alloy would be difficult to counterfeit.|$|E
5|$|On January 3, 2008, IGN {{reported}} that Valve employees {{had created a}} thread on Valve's website forums for players to list the problems they had encountered and to suggest fixes, which caused speculation that a patch was being planned to address the issues in the PlayStation 3 version, such as the frame rate issues, the connection problems in Team Fortress 2, and the slow loading times in Portal. A patch for the PlayStation 3 version was later released in North America on March 19, 2008 and in Europe a short while after that; however, it <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>mention</b> of fixing frame rate issues or slow loading times.|$|E

It was a five-member body: the four House deputies caucusing as Romanians, joined by George Grigorovici of the Bukovina Socialists. On the same day, Emperor Charles released his proclamation To my peoples, which promised a new political system for Cisleithania, but <b>made</b> virtually <b>no</b> <b>mention</b> of Bukovina's future organization.|$|R

5|$|The {{final draft}} of Compton's November 1941 report <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>mention</b> of using plutonium, but after {{discussing}} {{the latest research}} with Ernest Lawrence, Compton became convinced that a plutonium bomb was also feasible. In December, Compton was placed {{in charge of the}} plutonium project. Its objectives were to produce reactors to convert uranium to plutonium, to find ways to chemically separate the plutonium from the uranium, and to design and build an atomic bomb. It fell to Compton to decide which of the different types of reactor designs the scientists should pursue, even though a successful reactor had not yet been built. He proposed a schedule to achieve a controlled nuclear chain reaction by January 1943, and to have an atomic bomb by January 1945.|$|E
5|$|Davis fell in {{love with}} Sarah Knox Taylor, {{daughter}} of his commanding officer, future president Zachary Taylor. Both Sarah and Davis sought Taylor's permission to marry. Taylor refused, as he did not wish his daughter to have the difficult life of a military wife on frontier army posts. Davis's own experience led him to appreciate Taylor's objection. He consulted with his older brother Joseph, and they both began to question the value of an Army career. Davis hesitated to leave, but his desire for Sarah overcame this, and he resigned his commission in a letter dated April 20, 1835. He had arranged for the letter to be sent to the War Department for him on May 12 when he did not return from leave; he had <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>mention</b> to Taylor of his intention to resign. Against his former commander's wishes, on June 17, he married Sarah in Louisville, Kentucky. His resignation became effective June 30.|$|E
5|$|Don meets Rachel {{for dinner}} {{to make amends}} for the meeting. During the dinner, Don says he is living life to extract {{the maximum amount of}} {{pleasure}} as there is no tomorrow, while Rachel recognizes in Don the element of the disconnected outsider, for whom the world is laid out like a puzzle waiting to be solved. The two of them begin to bond, and she agrees to give Sterling Cooper another shot. Meanwhile, Pete and some of his co-workers go to a gentlemen's club to celebrate Pete's impending wedding. There, a waitress rejects Pete's advances. Dejected from this rejection and Don's recent criticisms, Pete arrives drunk at Peggy's apartment, and she invites him in. Don takes a train to a large house in the suburbs, where he is greeted by his loving wife Betty (January Jones), whom he has <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>mention</b> of thus far in the episode. He checks on their two sleeping children as she watches admiringly from the doorway.|$|E
50|$|The {{official}} Mehlis Report <b>made</b> <b>no</b> specific <b>mention</b> {{of anyone}} in the Syrian government as responsible for the assassination. However, the report was first erroneously released as a Microsoft Word document which preserved changes {{that had been made}} in the document since its creation.

30|$|The SFDRR {{identified}} disability-related {{needs and}} related references throughout the document {{and to a}} greater extent than the HFA, which <b>made</b> <b>no</b> direct <b>mention</b> of people with disabilities. The final SFDRR document includes more references to the needs of people with disabilities than the earlier Zero Draft. The additions intersect with Article 11 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN 2006). The SFDRR has assisted in firmly situating the topic of people with disabilities within international policy and discourse on disaster risk reduction.|$|R
5|$|In August 1944 Sayyid Abd al-Rahman {{met with}} senior Congress members and tribal leaders to discuss {{formation}} of a pro-independence political party that {{was not associated with}} Mahdism. The first step taken was to launch a new daily newspaper, al-Umma (The Community). In February 1945 the Umma party had been organized and the party's first secretary, Abdullah Khalil, applied for a government license. The constitution of the party <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>mention</b> of Sayyid Abd al-Rahman or of the Ansar; the only visible link to Abd al-Rahman was the party's reliance on him for funding. However, there were rumors that the Umma party had been created by the colonial government and aimed to place Sayyid Abd al-Rahman on the throne. These rumors persisted until June 1945, when the government publicly said it would not support a Mahdist monarchy.|$|E
5|$|The {{final draft}} of Compton's November 1941 report <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>mention</b> of using plutonium, but after {{discussing}} {{the latest research}} with Ernest Lawrence, Compton became convinced that a plutonium bomb was also feasible.

Its objectives were to produce reactors to convert uranium to plutonium, to find ways to chemically separate the plutonium from the uranium, and to design and build an atomic bomb. It fell to Compton to decide which of the different types of reactor designs the scientists should pursue, even though a successful reactor had not yet been built. He felt that having teams at Columbia, Princeton, the University of Chicago and the University of California was creating too much duplication and not enough collaboration, and he concentrated the work at the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago.|$|E
5|$|The {{size of the}} Legions {{decreased}} {{after the}} Treaty of Luneville (9 February 1801), which to the disappointment of the legionnaires <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>mention</b> of Poland. The Legions was transferred to police duties in the Kingdom of Etruria. The Legions' morale weakened as Poles were not used in any fights that seemed to directly affect the chance of Poland regaining independence. Many legionnaires, including General Kniaziewicz, {{felt that they had}} been used by the French and resigned. Dąbrowski remained in command, and reorganized both Legions at Milan into two 6,000-strong units in March 1801. On 21 December 1801 the Legions were reorganized by the French government into three demi-brigades, with the Italian (First) Legion forming the core of the First and Second Foreign Demi-Brigades (1er and 2e Demi-Brigade Étrangère), and the Danube (Second) Legion, the Third Foreign Demi-Brigade (3e Demi-Brigade Étrangère).|$|E
50|$|Although the Civil Rights Act of 1964 {{was written}} in order to end {{discrimination}} in various fields based on sex, religion, race, color, or national origin, {{in the area of}} employment, the 1964 Act did not include any prohibition on gender discrimination in public education and federally assisted programs but it did energize the women's rights movement, which had somewhat slowed after women's suffrage in 1920. While Title IX is best known for its impact on high school and collegiate athletics, the original statute <b>made</b> <b>no</b> explicit <b>mention</b> of sports.|$|R

5|$|When James Cameron {{agreed to}} make Spider-Man, Carolco lawyers simply used his {{previous}} Terminator 2 contract as a template. A clause in this agreement gave Cameron {{the right to decide}} on movie and advertising credits. Show business trade articles and advertisements <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>mention</b> of Golan, who was still actively assembling the elements for the film. In 1993, Golan complained publicly and finally instigated legal action against Carolco for disavowing his contractual guarantee credit as producer. On the other hand, Cameron had the contractual right to decide on credits. Eventually, Carolco sued Viacom and Columbia to recover broadcast and home video rights, and the two studios countersued. 20th Century Fox, though not part of the litigation, contested Cameron’s participation, claiming exclusivity on his services as a director under yet another contract. In 1996, Carolco, 21st Century, and Marvel went bankrupt.|$|E
5|$|Chinese Muslim traders {{from the}} eastern coast of China arrived at the coastal towns of Indonesia and Malaysia in the early 15th century. They were led by the mariner Zheng He, who {{commanded}} several expeditions to southeastern Asia between 1405 and 1430. In the book Yingya Shenglan, his translator Ma Huan documented {{the activities of the}} Chinese Muslims in the archipelago and the legacy left by Zheng He and his men. These traders settled along the northern coast of Java, but there is no documentation of their settlements beyond the 16th century. The Chinese Muslims were likely to have been absorbed into the majority Muslim population. Between 1450 and 1520, the Ming Dynasty's interest in southeastern Asia reached a low point and trade, both legal and illegal, rarely reached the archipelago. The Portuguese <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>mention</b> of any resident Chinese minority population when they arrived in Indonesia in the early 16th century. Trade from the north was re-established when China legalized private trade in 1567 through licensing 50 junks a year. Several years later silver began flowing into the region, from Japan, Mexico, and Europe, and trade flourished once again. Distinct Chinese colonies emerged in hundreds of ports throughout southeastern Asia, including the pepper port of Banten.|$|E
5|$|Limbert and Roworth have commented that, {{unlike other}} peat areas, {{such as the}} Somerset Levels, where {{recording}} of the industrial heritage has been systematic, the recording of the industrial archaeology of Thorne and Hatfield Moors has been notably scarce. A guide to the industrial history of South Yorkshire published in 1995 <b>made</b> <b>no</b> <b>mention</b> of peat at all. The canals dug by the Dutch and operated until the 1920s have been mentioned by canal historians such as Charles Hadfield, but have never been investigated systematically. The railways have received a little more attention in the specialist press, {{and some of the}} locomotives have been preserved. The history of the workers has been partially recorded through the Thorne and Hatfield Moors Oral History Project. In contrast, the ecology of the moors has been better documented, through the publication of the Thorne and Hatfield Moors Papers, first published by the Doncaster Naturalists Society in 1987. Since 1989, the Thorne and Hatfield Moors Conservation Forum have taken over this responsibility. These papers now run to eight volumes, and the forum has also published technical papers on many aspects of the moors.|$|E
