25|$|Microfilarial {{detection}} {{was accomplished}} most commonly {{in the past}} by the microscopic identification of microfilariae on a direct blood smear, above the buffy coat in a microhematocrit tube (or capillary tube), using the , or after <b>millipore</b> filtration. The accuracy of these tests, typically used for routine screening or diagnosis of heartworm infection, is improved by multiple testing. The modified Knott test and <b>millipore</b> filtration are more sensitive because they concentrate microfilariae, improving the chance of diagnosis. The direct smear technique allows examination of larval motion, helping in the distinction of D. immitis from Acanthocheilonema reconditum. This distinction is important because {{the presence of the}} latter parasite does not require expensive and potentially harmful therapy. However, the potential for a microfilaremic infections is 5-67%. The number of circulating microfilariae does not correlate with the number of adult heartworms, so is not an indicator of disease severity.|$|E
