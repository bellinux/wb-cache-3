40|$|Abstract. Magnesium {{die-casting}} {{has experienced}} dramatic {{growth over the}} past decade and the recycling of <b>magnesium</b> <b>scrap</b> has become increasingly important due to the generation of substantial quantities of scrap in the die-casting process. Magnesium is a readily recyclable material and the recycling of <b>magnesium</b> <b>scrap</b> is crucial in making magnesium more competitive. The main concern associated with using the secondary magnesium is the high level of Fe content and oxide inclusions that are detrimental to the corrosion and mechanical properties of the secondary alloy. In this study, the die-cast specimens were produced using the recycled class 1 scrap which is refined by means of Ar bubbling and Mn addition without using refining fluxes, and their mechanical properties and corrosion characteristics were investigated. The results showed that the tensile properties of the secondary AZ 91 alloy were equivalent to those of the primary magnesium alloy after appropriate treatments. The corrosion resistance of the recycled magnesium was also found to increase by Ar bubbling and Mn addition...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Up to date, a {{reasonable}} and adequate process to treat <b>magnesium</b> <b>scraps</b> in die casting factory {{is not yet}} achieved, especially for middle or small scale die casters. Actually, many existing methods of handling <b>magnesium</b> <b>scraps</b> have met the level of technology for practical utilization requirement. Now, {{what we have to}} do is to propose a systematic handling process according to factory suitability and cost consideration. In this paper, the classification of <b>magnesium</b> <b>scraps</b> will be introduced first. Then the complementary storage methods and treatment methods for each type of scraps and recycle policy for die casters will be discussed. Finally, we propose a management model of <b>magnesium</b> <b>scraps</b> that is possibly suitable to some die casting factories...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} develop a {{recycling}} process of <b>magnesium</b> <b>scraps,</b> a fundamental study on the evaporation behavior of magnesium melt was carried out. Melt temperature, vacuum degree, surface area of melt, and reaction time were considered as experimental variables. The evaporation amount of magnesium increases {{with the increase of}} reaction time, melt temperature, surface area of melt, and vacuum degree. In the pressure range below 6650 Pa, the evaporation rate of magnesium sharply increased with the increase of the vacuum degree in the reactor. When the pressure increased over 6650 Pa, the evaporation rate of magnesium was very low and independent of the pressure. An empirical equation for the evaporation rate of magnesium melt was derived. The evaporation coefficient of magnesium was determined to be about 9. 074 x 10 - 5 under investigated conditions...|$|R
40|$|We have {{proposed}} the 'Solid Recycling Process' {{as a new}} recycling process for <b>magnesium</b> alloys <b>scraps.</b> In the new process, recycled materials can be fabricated by extruding the scraps without melting. In this research, AZ 91 D <b>magnesium</b> alloy <b>scraps</b> by thixo-molding process were recycled by this process and mechanical and corrosion properties of the recycled materials were investigated. Chemical compositions of the solid recycled specimen were in agreement {{with those of the}} Japanese Industrial Standard of AZ 91 D and the contamination levels were low. The solid recycled specimens showed higher strength and larger elongation than the virgin ingot specimen at room temperature. The feature of the solid recycling process is improvement of mechanical properties by recycling. The improvement of mechanical properties is attributed to grain refinement by hot extrusion. Mass loss of the solid recycled specimen after 72 hour in 3 mass% NaCl solution was about 1. 5 &# 0215; 10 - 2 kg/m 2 which was comparable with that of the virgin ingot specimen...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order for}} {{magnesium}} {{to continue to}} grow, all forms of <b>magnesium</b> <b>scrap</b> need to be recycled – for both economic and environmental reasons. This paper extensively reviews the techniques for the refining and recycling of magnesium. Removal of inter-metallic elements and inclusions through gas fluxing, filtration and other methods are summarized. Flux refining technology is the old but most common method to purify magnesium metal. Fluxless refining technologies are under development, such as salt furnace technology, inert gas and filter refining, vacuum distillation refining, and hydrometallurgical methods. Magnesium scraps recycling is discussed, techniques to protecting Mg (or Mg alloy) melt with protective atmosphere and salt flux are briefly introduced...|$|E
40|$|Metal Oxygen Separation Technologies, Inc.

The new process, designated MagReGenTM, is very effective in laboratory experiments, and on scale-up promises to be the lowest-cost lowest-energy lowest-impact method for separating magnesium metal from aluminum while recovering oxidized magnesium. MagReGenTM uses as little as one-eighth {{as much energy as}} today's methods for recycling magnesium metal from comingled scrap.

40|$|Magnesium {{recycling}} {{has become}} more important in today’s environmentally aware society. To prompt the usage of recycled <b>magnesium</b> <b>scrap</b> and further improve casting structure and properties, a novel physical approach, the rheo-diecasting process (RDC), has been applied {{in the present study}} to deal with AZ 91 D Mg-alloy directly from die-casting scrap. The experimental results show that the RDC process can be used to produce recycled AZ 91 D alloy with fine and uniform microstructure and a very low level of porosity. The intermetallic compounds containing the impurity elements were of fine and of spherical morphology, distributed uniformly in the alloy matrix. No oxide particle clusters or oxide films were found in the RDC microstructure. The tensile properties of the recycled AZ 91 D alloy were comparable to those produced by RDC from the primary alloy ingots., and much better than those produced by conventional High Pressure Die Casting (HPDC) ...|$|E
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{applicability}} of spark plasma sintering (SPS) as a solid state recycling technique for <b>magnesium</b> alloy <b>scrap.</b> In this respect, machining chips from pure Mg and AZ 31 Mg alloy ingots are chemically cleaned, cold compacted and SPSed directly into bulk specimens. It is found that SPS can successfully establish full densification and effective metallurgical bonding between chips without altering compositional constituents. This is attributed to the dynamic compaction during sintering {{as well as to}} the disruption of the chips' surface oxide film due to SPS electric current based joule heating. Apart from the successful consolidation, microstructural analysis of the initial Mg ingots, chips and SPS recycled material reveals that the SPS microstructure was finer than that of the original ingots due to significant deformation induced grain refinement during machining. As a result, the recycled materials had a higher compression and shear strength than that of the starting ingot material. The findings indicate that SPS is an effective alternative method for solid state recycling of <b>magnesium</b> alloy <b>scrap.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{possibility}} of removing impurities during magnesium recycling with pyrometallurgical techniques has been evaluated by using a thermodynamic analysis. For 25 different elements {{that are likely to}} be contained in industrial magnesium alloys, the equilibrium distribution ratios between the metal, slag and gas phases in the magnesium remelting process were calculated assuming binary systems of magnesium and an impurity element. It was found that calcium, gadolinium, lithium, ytterbium and yttrium can be removed from the remelted end-of-life (EoL) magnesium products by oxidization. Calcium, cerium, gadolinium, lanthanum, lithium, plutonium, sodium, strontium and yttrium can be removed by chlorination with a salt flux. However, the other elements contained in <b>magnesium</b> alloy <b>scrap</b> are scarcely removed and this may contribute toward future contamination problems. The third technological option for the recycling of EoL magnesium products is magnesium recovery by a distillation process. Based on thermodynamic considerations, it is predicted that high-purity magnesium can be recovered through distillation because of its high vapor pressure, yet there is a limit on recoverability that depends on the equilibrium vapor pressure of the alloying elements and the large energy consumption. Therefore, the sustainable recycling of EoL magnesium products should be an important consideration in the design of advanced magnesium alloys or the development of new refining processes...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of selected casting methods on mechanical behaviour of Al-Mg-Si alloy. The casting methods used was spin, sand and die casting, these were done {{with a view to}} determine which of the casting methods will produce the best properties. The pure aluminium <b>scrap,</b> <b>magnesium</b> and silicon were subjected to chemical analysis using spectrometric analyzer, thereafter the charge calculation to determine the amount needed to be charged into the furnace was properly worked out and charged into the crucible furnace from which as-cast aluminium was obtained. The mechanical properties of the casting produced were assessed by hardness and impact toughness test. The optical microscopy and experimental density and porosity were also investigated. From the results it was observed that magnesium and silicon were well dispersed in aluminium matrix of the spin casting. It was observed from visual examination after machining that there were minimal defects. It was also observed that out of the three casting methods, spin casting possesses the best mechanical properties (hardness and impact toughness) ...|$|R
40|$|Thermal de-coating {{of painted}} and {{lacquered}} scrap {{is one of}} the new innovations developed for aluminum recycling. If implemented in all recycling and optimized as suggested in this article, recovery would be improved with considerable economic impact. Generally, contaminated scrap is difficult to recycle. Direct re-melting of coated scrap results in the generation of gaseous emissions, with increased metal oxidation, contamination, and salt flux usage. By thermal de-coating of the scrap these problems are avoided. Thermal de-coating followed by remelting of aluminum scrap is now common practice, while painted <b>magnesium</b> <b>scrap</b> is not currently de-coated and recycled. This article presents observations during heating of the contaminated light metals together with the mass loss, evolved gases, and residue after de-coating in order to give a general description of the de-coating process. It is argued that the main behavior during de-coating may be described as two distinct regimes—scission and combustion—regardless of metal substrate and coating. Monitoring the combustion regime should assure optimum de-coating. Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityMagnesium is {{the least}} dense {{engineering}} metal, with an excellent stiffness-to-weight ratio. Magnesium recycling is important for both economic and environmental reasons. This project demonstrates feasibility of a new environmentally friendly process for recycling partially oxidized <b>magnesium</b> <b>scrap</b> to produce very pure magnesium at low cost. It combines refining and solid oxide membrane (SOM) based oxide electrolysis in the same reactor. Magnesium and its oxide are dissolved in a molten flux. This is followed by argon-assisted evaporation of dissolved magnesium, which is subsequently condensed in a separate condenser. The molten flux acts as a selective medium for magnesium dissolution, but not aluminum or iron, and therefore the magnesium collected has high purity. Potentiodynamic scans are performed to monitor the magnesium content change in the scrap {{as well as in}} solution in the flux. The SOM electrolysis is employed in the refining system to enable electrolysis of the magnesium oxide dissolved in the flux from the partially oxidized scrap. During the SOM electrolysis, oxygen anions are transported out of the flux through a yttria stabilized zirconia membrane to a liquid silver anode where they are oxidized. Simultaneously, magnesium cations are transported through the flux to a steel cathode where they are reduced. The combination of refining and SOM electrolysis yields close to 100 % removal of magnesium metal from partially oxidized <b>magnesium</b> <b>scrap.</b> The magnesium recovered has a purity of 99. 6 w%. To produce pure oxygen it is critical to develop an inert anode current collector for use with the non-consumable liquid silver anode. In this work, an innovative inert anode current collector is successfully developed and used in SOM electrolysis experiments. The current collector employs a sintered strontium-doped lanthanum manganite (La 0. 8 Sr 0. 2 Mn 03 -δ or LSM) bar, an Inconel alloy 601 rod, and a liquid silver contact in between. SOM electrolysis experiments with the new LSM-Inconel current collector are carried out and performance comparable to the state-of-the-art SOM electrolysis for Mg production employing the non-inert anode has been demonstrated. In both refining and SOM electrolysis, magnesium solubility in the flux plays an important role. High magnesium solubility in the flux facilitates refining. On the other hand, lower magnesium solubility benefits the SOM electrolysis. The dissolution of magnesium imparts electronic conductivity to the flux. The effects of the electronic conductivity of the flux on the SOM electrolysis performance are examined in detail through experiments and modeling. Methods for mitigating the negative attributes of the electronic conductivity during SOM electrolysis are presented...|$|E
40|$|A {{fundamental}} metric for {{the assessment}} of the recyclability and, hence, the sustainability of coated <b>magnesium</b> <b>scrap</b> is presented; this metric combines kinetics and thermodynamics. The recycling process, consisting of thermal decoating and remelting, was studied by thermogravimetry and differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA) experiments and thermodynamic simulations. Decoating phenomena are interpreted using kinetic analysis, applying existing reaction models. The derived kinetic model parameters ln A and E a /(RT p) are used to characterize the decoating process. The impact of inorganic coating components on remelting is quantified using exergy. Oxidation and entrapment losses, quality losses, and material resource depletion caused by the inorganic components are expressed in exergy units and combined into the single parameter. Based on the results, the coating characteristics favorable for recycling are derived. The obtained metric is a three-dimensional (3 –D) combination of ln A, E a /(RT p), and, which represent the decoating velocity, the ease of decoating, and the impact of coating materials on the remelting process, respectively. The metric, therefore, directly links coating characteristics, coating design, and product design with process technology and recyclability, enabling the ranking of coating alternatives in terms of their respective recyclability. Therefore, the key idea {{of this article is to}} use fundamental metallurgical theory to express the recyclability of postconsumer scrap in a unique combination of parameters. This should pave the way for ranking the sustainability of different materials. Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|E
