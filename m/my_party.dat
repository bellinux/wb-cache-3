500|$|Willkie {{never had}} any doubt that Roosevelt would run for a third term, and that his route to the White House {{would have to be}} through the Republican Party. [...] In late 1939 he changed his {{registration}} from Democratic to Republican, and early in 1940 announced that he would accept the Republican nomination if it were offered to him. [...] He blamed his allegiance shift on the Roosevelt policies that he deemed anti-business. He had voted for Landon in 1936, he said, and he felt that the Democrats no longer represented the values he advocated. [...] As he later characterized it, [...] "I did not leave <b>my</b> <b>party.</b> [...] <b>My</b> <b>party</b> left me." ...|$|E

[...] "To do this, I was ready to resort to unusual measures and to risk my own standing and reputation within <b>my</b> <b>party</b> and the country." [...] All of his efforts were in vain; Hayes failed to convince the South to accept the idea of racial equality and failed to convince Congress to appropriate funds to enforce the civil rights laws.|$|E

500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the presidential election, the image of McCain was removed from the video.

[...] The video screens displayed images of Obama along with the message, [...] "We Won". Madonna also publicly voiced her opposition for Republican Vice Presidential candidate for 2008, Sarah Palin. While performing on the tour, Madonna shouted [...] "Sarah Palin can't come to <b>my</b> <b>party.</b> Sarah Palin can't come to my show. It's nothing personal. [...] Here's the sound of Sarah Palin's husband's snowmobile when it won't start. (followed by a loud screeching noise)." [...] While performing [...] "I Love New York" [...] during the request section, the line [...] "Get off my street" [...] was replaced by Madonna screaming [...] "You know who can get off of my street?

500|$|The {{song was}} also {{added to the}} six song set list of the Hard Candy Promo Tour in 2008. Madonna wore a shiny black outfit with black tails, Adidas track pants and high-heeled, lace-up boots. [...] "Hung Up" [...] was the fourth song of the set list. It was re-invented as a heavy-metal version. As the {{performance}} of [...] "4 Minutes" [...] ended, Madonna picked up an electric guitar and played the first few chords of The Rolling Stones single [...] "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction". She then asked the crowd whether {{they thought they had}} come to a Rolling Stones concert. When the crowd responded negatively, she started [...] "Hung Up", while dedicating it to all the people who had waited outside in the queue to watch the show. She declared that the noisy, metallic guitar breakdown of the song symbolised what waiting sounded like in the brain of all those who had waited. The song was performed in the futuristic rave with Japanese influences segment of the 2008 Sticky & Sweet Tour. Madonna wore a futuristic robotic outfit designed by Heatherette, with plates on her shoulder and a wig with long curled hair. The similar heavy-metal version of [...] "Hung Up" [...] was performed but it later gave way to the ABBA music. Before starting the performance, she played a capella versions of her older hit songs on audience demand, mostly [...] "Express Yourself" [...] and [...] "Like a Virgin". However, after that, the electric guitar was played to make noises, which Madonna dedicated to Republican vice-presidential nominee for the 2008 election, Sarah Palin. She said, [...] "I'd like to express myself to Sarah Palin right now. [...] This is the sound of Sarah Palin thinking. [...] Sarah Palin can't come to <b>my</b> <b>party.</b> Sarah Palin can't come to my show. It's nothing personal." [...] The performance ended with Madonna playing the guitar riff of [...] "A New Level" [...] by heavy-metal band Pantera. For the second European leg of the tour in 2009, [...] "Hung Up" [...] was removed from the setlist and was replaced by an up-beat version of [...] "Frozen".|$|E
