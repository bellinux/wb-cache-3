The {{aim of this}} study was to characterize fine particle emissions with a view to pinpoint parameters influencing the emissions. Additionally effectiveness of used flue gas cleaning techniques was assessed. The results show that large quantities of fine particles are emitted to the atmosphere from both boilers. From 1 MW boiler equipped only in <b>multicyclone</b> 4. 8 * 107 of particles/cm 3 (particles with diameter smaller than 0. 6 μm) are emitted to the atmosphere.

However, understanding on the operation of <b>multicyclones</b> is hardly available in literatures. In this respect, a study to investigate the effect of different area of axial entry of a miniature cyclone of MR-deDuster, a multi-cyclones unit developed as particulate emission control device is presented in this paper. The development of the MR-deDuster was based on semi-empirical equations introduced by Lapple coupled with standard cyclone dimensions by Stairmand.

40|$|The use of biofuel {{has been}} {{increasing}} in Europe over the last years, {{and the reason for}} that is acceptable cost and the least negative impact on the environment. However, NOx and emissions of fine particulates are important, and biofuel is still a disadvantage compared to oil and natural gas fired systems. Usually, flue gas is filtered in <b>multicyclones</b> or fibre filters before discharge into the atmosphere. Yet, in the case of fine particulates, the filters of such type do not show high effectiveness, thus electrostatic precipitators are used. In this comparative study on biofuel (wood pellets), the collection efficiency of solid particles from a class 3 boiler (50 kW) and from a gasification unit (100 kW) was investigated. Although releases of solid particles from modern boilers are low, a combination of such a boiler with an electrostatic precipitator may reduce the releases of particles to the minimum, and the collection efficiency of the electrostatic precipitator obtained during the investigation was ~ 98 - 99 %. There is a big difference in particle concentrations comparing the systems with flue gas and producer gas. As the working conditions in the test section with producer gas were harder, it led to lower efficiency of the electrostatic precipitator (~ 75 %) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{emissions}} of particles, and gaseous compounds, into the ambient air from biomass-fired moving grate boilers were characterized under different boiler operation conditions. The boilers had a thermal capacity of similar to 1 MW. The {{flue gas cleaning}} systems consisted of <b>multicyclones</b> {{for the removal of}} coarse particles. Dry wood fuel that consisted of shavings, wood chips, and sawdust from a local wood industry and wood pellets were fired at two plants. The influence of boiler load on the emissions was characterized. An electrical low-pressure impactor (ELPI) was used to determine the particle number concentration with high time resolution. A low-pressure cascade impactor (LPI) was utilized for the mass size distribution and the size-differentiated chemical composition. Elemental analysis of the fly ash collected on impactor substrates was made by particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) analysis. The concentration of elemental carbon under different load conditions was also measured. In addition, {{emissions of}} polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from the boiler that was operating on dry wood fuel were compared with PAH emissions from two different biomass-fired boilers (one was operating on forest residues and the other on pellets). The boiler load had little influence on the particle mass concentration of submicrometer-sized particles, which was in the range of 50 - 75 mg/m(3) (0 degreesC, 101. 3 kPa, dry gas, 13 % CO 2). The total particle number concentration increased and the particle size decreased as the boiler load increased. The elemental analysis revealed that potassium and sulfur were the dominating components in the submicrometer size range, whereas potassium and calcium were major components in the coarse fraction. The PAH emissions between the three boilers varied by almost 3 orders of magnitude...|$|R
40|$|Abstract High {{particle}} {{concentration in the}} air is a health risk, and particles from domestic biomass combustion are a significant particle source. In larger boilers, particles are {{an important element in}} the build-up of deposits on heat transfer surfaces, causing increased operation and maintenance costs. The objective of this thesis is to present new emission data for particles from biomass combustion in domestic devices and grate-fired district heating boilers (downstream of <b>multicyclones),</b> to investigate particles in a circulating fluidised bed (CFB) boiler, and to illustrate how particles can be influenced by additives. Finally, the two main approaches used in domestic combustion are compared, and a probe for sampling at high flue gas temperature is designed. The mass concentration of particles from domestic combustion of woody fuels was measured to be 12 - 120 mg/MJ, except for two extreme cases. Combustion of wood pellets showed the lowest emissions, comparable with the mass concentrations from district heating boilers. Domestic oat combustion gave 114 mg/MJ. The use of limestone as an additive for oat combustion did not affect the emitted particle mass, while the addition of kaolin resulted in lower concentration of particles. The number concentration of particles was 1 • 1012 - 1 • 1014 1 /MJ for domestic combustion, and lower from district heating boilers. Flue gas from domestic devices and district heating boilers showed particle size distributions dominated by fine particles (< 1 µm), both in terms of mass and number (measured with a low-pressure impactor and an electrical low-pressure impactor). Under poor combustion conditions, concentrations were higher, with the fine particle maximum in the size distribution being displaced towards a larger size. Efficient combustion of wood pellets resulted in particles mainly containing K 2 SO 4, while wood/straw pellets led to KCl particles. Potassium and phosphorus dominated the particles from oat combustion. The mass size distributions in the CFB boiler had maxima for coarse and fine particles respectively. The addition of kaolin to the combustion or co-combustion with sewage sludge lowered the concentration of fine particles, but increased the concentration of coarse particles. For domestic wood combustion, the value of particle mass concentration measured in cooled flue gas was higher (2 - 10 times) than the values measured in the chimney...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to characterise {{particle}} emissions from district heating units operating on three commonly used biofuels: forest residues, pellets and sawdust. Boilers used in the three district heating units were of moving grate type, with the maximum thermal output between 1 and 1. 5 MW. The measurements were done after <b>multicyclones,</b> the only particle removal devices installed, therefore the direct emissions to ambient air were characterised. Number and mass size distributions were determined. Elemental composition of the particles, was determined by particle induced X-ray emissions analysis (PIXE) and thermal-optical analysis. Particles' morphology was assessed on the basis of transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Total number concentration of emitted particles with aerodynamic diameter smaller than 5 pm (PM 5) at medium operation load ranged from 6. 3 to 7. 7 x 10 (7) particles/cm(n) (3), with the slightly higher values from combustion of forest residues. PM 5 mass concentration at medium load from low pressure impactor measurements ranged between 51 and 120 mg. /m(n) (3), with the highest values from unit operating on forest residues. Both PM 5 mass and total number concentrations were dominated by fine mode contributions i. e. particles with aerodynamic diameter smaller than 1 mum (PM 1). Elements determined by PIXE (Z > 12) contributed to 21 - 34 % of PM 1 mass, of which K, S, Cl and Ca contributed to 18 - 33 % of PM 1 mass, and Zn, Mn, Fe, Cr, Pb and Cd to 1 - 3 %. Emitted concentrations of heavy metals depended on type of the fuel and operating load. Particulate organic (OC) and elemental (EC) carbon contribution to PM 1 ranged from 1 - 19 % and 0 - 56 %. respectively. Particulate OC concentrations strongly depended on the operation load regardless the type of the fuel, while EC concentrations seemed to depend both on load and the type of the fuel. Considering the potential public health implications of the obtained results, further research is needed to carefully assess the impact of particle emissions from biofuels combustion on human health and environment...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Biomass {{facilities}} have received increasing attention {{as a strategy}} to increase the use of renewable fuels and decrease greenhouse gas emissions from the electric generation and heating sectors, but these facilities can potentially increase local air pollution and associated health effects. Comparing the economic costs and public health benefits of alternative biomass fuel, heating technology, and pollution control technology options provides decision-makers with the necessary information to make optimal choices in a given location. METHODS: For {{a case study of}} a combined heat and power biomass facility in Syracuse, New York, we used stack testing to estimate emissions of fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5) for both the deployed technology (staged combustion pellet boiler with an electrostatic precipitator) and a conventional alternative (wood chip stoker boiler with a <b>multicyclone).</b> We used the atmospheric dispersion model AERMOD to calculate the contribution of either fuel-technology configuration to ambient primary PM 2. 5 in a 10 km x 10 km region surrounding the facility, and we quantified the incremental contribution to population mortality and morbidity. We assigned economic values to health outcomes and compared the health benefits of the lower-emitting technology with the incremental costs. RESULTS: In total, the incremental annualized cost of the lower-emitting pellet boiler was $ 190, 000 greater, driven by a greater cost of the pellet fuel and pollution control technology, offset in part by reduced fuel storage costs. PM 2. 5 emissions were a factor of 23 lower with the pellet boiler with electrostatic precipitator, with corresponding differences in contributions to ambient primary PM 2. 5 concentrations. The monetary value of the public health benefits of selecting the pellet-fired boiler technology with electrostatic precipitator was $ 1. 7 million annually, greatly exceeding the differential costs even when accounting for uncertainties. Our analyses also showed complex spatial patterns of health benefits given non-uniform age distributions and air pollution levels. CONCLUSIONS: The incremental investment in a lower-emitting staged combustion pellet boiler with an electrostatic precipitator was well justified by the population health improvements over the conventional wood chip technology with a <b>multicyclone,</b> even given the focus on only primary PM 2. 5 within a small spatial domain. Our analytical framework could be generalized to other settings to inform optimal strategies for proposed new facilities or populations.

40|$|International audienceNew {{efficient}} {{approaches to}} the characterization of fly ash and particulate matter (PM) have to be developed {{in order to better}} understand their impacts on environment and health. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) contained in PM from biomass burning have been identified as genotoxic and cytotoxic, and some tools already exist to quantify their contribution to PM. Optical fluorescence microscopy is proposed as a rapid and relatively economical method to allow the quantification of PAH in different particles emitted from biomass combustion. In this study samples were collected in the flue gas of biomass-combustion facilities with nominal output ranging from 40 kW to 17. 3 MW. The fly ash samples were collected with various flue gas treatment devices (<b>multicyclone,</b> baghouse filter, electrostatic precipitator); PM samples were fractionated from the flue gas with a DEKATI® DGI impactor. A method using fluorescence observations (at 470 nm), white-light observations and image processing has been developed with the aim of quantifying fluorescence per sample. Organic components of PM and fly ash, such as PAH, humic-like substances (HULIS) and water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) were also quantified. Fluorescence microscopy analysis method assessment was first realized with fly ash that was artificially coated with PAH and HULIS. Total amounts of PAH in the three size fractions of actual PM from biomass burning strongly correlated with the intensities of fluorescence. These encouraging results {{contribute to the development of}} a faster and cheaper method of quantifying particle-bound PAH...|$|E

Improvement of work quality at {{the reduction of}} quantity of steps of division {{can be reached by}} increasing an starch yield from the step with the reduction of an exit of a liquid phase. To achieve that, a connection of three multicyclones according to the cross scheme is used as for a step of division instead of a separate <b>multicyclone.</b> It is shown that at the three multicyclones a step of division of change in redistribution of suspension components is created the design solution of the division step where liquid products are going out with only to liquid ones, and condensed products – only with condensed ones. At this step the starch yield increases in the condensed product while reducing the end product volume; therefore is received in one step the higher quality starch because of its increased quantity in the condensed descent product step. However, at such connection of multicyclones starch gets to a liquid descent of each step, therefore it is condensed additionally to release starch by con-necting of four multicyclones in to one step of division. New multistage multicyclonic installation consists of 12 multicyclones instead of 15 ones. That reduces capital and operational costs.

40|$|Food {{industries}} like biscuit and confectionary use {{significant amount}} of fossil fuel for thermal energy. Biscuit manufacturing in India is carried out both by organized and unorganized sector. The ratio of organized to unorganized sector is 60 : 40 (1). The total biscuit manufacturing in the organized sector India in 2008 was about 1. 7 million metric tons (1). Accounting for the unorganized sector in India, the total biscuit manufacturing would have been about 2. 9 million metric tons/annum. A typical biscuit baking is carried in a long tunnel kiln with varying temperature in different zones. Generally diesel is used to provide the necessary heat energy for the baking purpose, with temperature ranging from 190 C in the drying zone to about 300 C in the baking area and has to maintain in the temperature range of +/- 5 C. Typical oil consumption is about 40 litres per ton of biscuit production. The paper discusses the experience in substituting about 120 lts per hour kiln for manufacturing about 70 tons of biscuit daily. The system configuration consists of a 500 kg/hr gasification system comprising of a reactor, <b>multicyclone,</b> water scrubbers, and two blowers for maintaining the constant gas pressure in the header before the burners.

40|$|Wood-fired Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants {{connected}} to District Heating (DH) networks can represent an {{efficient way to}} exploit biomass. Medium and small plants in rural areas can be supplied with local biomass and can contribute to increase the production of renewable energy in a sustainable way. In the last years, according to EU targets and thanks to the incentives provided on energy production from renewables, the number of biomass-fired CHP plants has continuously increased. In order to assess the behaviour and performance of a whole plant and of its various components it is essential to analyse operational data and parameters over the time. Real operation data can differ from nominal data because of their dependence on different parameters, i. e. biomass quality and moisture content, outdoor temperature, heat load, etc. The performance of each component has to be evaluated in order to assess the overall efficiency of the system and to find possible improvements. In this work the operational data of a wood fired CHP plant coupled to a DH network supplying users in a mountainous area are analysed. The DH system is supplied by two hot water boilers of total heat output of 8 MW and by a CHP system. The CHP system is made of a thermal oil boiler with nominal heat output of 6, 5 MW, an ORC unit with nominal electrical power 650 kW, a flue gas cleaning systems with a <b>multicyclone</b> and an electrofilter and two heat storage tanks. The DH network is about 20 km with almost 500 supplied users. The ORC unit is used at maximum power in the winter season, and at partial load in summer when the heat load mainly provides domestic hot water. The analyses performed over a whole heating season allowed to define operational patterns of the CHP unit with the overall DH operation. A good electric efficiency at partial loads has been assessed, accordingly to the data provided from the manufacturer.
