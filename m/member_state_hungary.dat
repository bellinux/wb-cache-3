40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{investigate}} {{the impact of the}} 2004 EU enlargement upon the sustainability of the European Social Model. Prior to the 2004 enlargement the existing literature, which conducted various top-down empirical studies of the 2004 new <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> argues the new <b>member</b> <b>states</b> to be a homogenous neoliberal bloc of countries which will erode the ESM. In a post 2004 EU the thesis takes a bottom-up analysis of the behaviour of two new <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> <b>Hungary</b> and Poland, upon two EU, policy-making case studies to assess the current claim. Firstly, the thesis investigates the current varieties of capitalism within Hungary and Poland to assess the claim that the new <b>member</b> <b>states</b> are a homogenous neoliberal bloc of countries.

40|$|The article {{attempts}} to measure relative efficiency in utilizing public education expenditures {{in the new}} EU <b>member</b> <b>states</b> {{in comparison to the}} selected EU (plus Croatia) and OECD countries. As resources allocated to education are significantly limited, a special emphasis should be given to their efficient use regarding the institutional and legal constraints. By applying non-parametric methodology, i. e. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), a relative efficiency is defined as the deviation from the efficiency frontier which represents the maximum output/outcome attainable from each input level. An analysis of (output-oriented) efficiency measures shows that among the new EU <b>member</b> <b>states</b> <b>Hungary,</b> Estonia and Slovenia seem to be good benchmark countries in the field of primary, secondary and tertiary education, respectively. The empirical results also suggest that, in general, new EU <b>member</b> <b>states</b> show relatively high efficiency in tertiary education efficiency measures...|$|R

Only Poland has noted surplus in foreign trade in food products definitely highest and quickly growing. Poland also has been the largest exporter of agricultural products among the new EU <b>member</b> <b>states</b> (<b>Hungary</b> and Czech Republic occupy distant places). The assessment of competitiveness of foreign trade of agricultural products in the new members performed with the RCA (Revealed Comparative Advantages) in export to world market and Lafay’s index, has confirmed that Polish food sector is competitive on the world mar-ket.

40|$|The European Commission filed {{infringement}} procedures {{against both}} its <b>member</b> <b>states</b> <b>Hungary</b> and Poland, addressing recent, highly controversial legislation {{passed by the}} respective governments.

Such an illiberal turn {{is not unique to}} these countries, it is rather a global trend with the decay of democracy being evident in all regions of the world. Thus, the regimes turning away from democracy towards autocracy are subjects to numerous scientific debates. Wolfgang Merkel developed the concept of defective democracies to conceptualise the a grey zonea between both regime types. This thesis will assess and categorise the states of democracy of Hungary and Poland in accordance to this concept.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} exit from agriculture under the implementation of CAP payments in four selected EU countries (France, Hungary, Italy and Poland) in the period 2005 - 08. The study employs micro-data from the European Union Labour Force Survey and regional data from the Farm Accountancy Data Network. We differentiate among the different measures of farm payments, looking at the individual impact of Pillar 1 instruments, i. e. coupled and decoupled payments, and at those in Pillar 2, targeted at rural development. The main results suggest that total subsidies at the regional level are negatively associated with the out-farm migration of agricultural workers in the two New <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> <b>Hungary</b> and Poland, so that the CAP would seem to hinder the exit of labour from agriculture. Conversely, the non-significant results for the ‘old’ <b>member</b> <b>states</b> may be interpreted {{as the result of}} opposing effects of coupled payments and rural development support. The diverse impact of CAP on the likelihood of leaving agriculture in the four countries reflects the heterogeneity across European <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> due to different market and production structures, which does not allow a common and simple generalisation of the effect of the CAP on labour allocation...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} agricultural sigma convergence in four old <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> and in <b>Hungary.</b> The analysis {{was derived from the}} output and input data from the Economic Accounts for Agriculture between 1990 - 2005. The results obtained indicate significant convergence in the old <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> and <b>Hungary.</b> First of all this held true for incomes but the inputs do not reveal a perceptible pattern. However, in terms of outputs Hungary lags well behind the Old <b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> but the difference is not nearly as great for inputs. This can probably be {{explained by the fact that}} the rate of increase for inputs is higher than for producer prices, meaning the relative prices of agricultural output and input products (agricultural terms of trade) are increasing, which decelerates the convergence process. Even the improvement in efficiency can only partly compensate for these negative effects. The results of the analysis underline the importance of the number of employees of which the continual and significant decrease largely determines convergence itself and also its rate. sigma convergence, EU, agriculture, income, indicators, Agribusiness,...|$|R

In the Romanian agri-food system, there is a correlation between pork production and purchasing power. Romania's pork consumption is still substantially below that of the European average of 46. 4 kg per capita. A positive aspect is {{the lifting of the}} ban on Romanian pork to the European Union. Therefore, it could be considered a boost of the food industry, as the trade system could be developed, satisfying local and overseas supply and demand. Taking into account the current tendencies for pork production and exchanges in European Union, one could find out that there is a reduction of livestock in the European Union. Pork production depends on country and it is linked to feed prices and reorganization. The analysis is based on statistical data regarding pork production, highlighting its evolution of pork production before and after our country’s accession to the European Union, comparing pork production evolution at national level to the average one of other countries, during the period of time 2001 - 2012.

In the early 2000 s, a new structure with more competitive, more innovative areas and also with lagging settlements and areas seem to emerge. As result of the differentiation processes {{of the past two}} decades, in comparison with the EU <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> <b>Hungary</b> has the largest gap in GDP per capita among its regions. A little more than 50 % of the Hungarian micro-regions have disadvantaged conditions for 30 % of the population. Even now, in many studies and disputes, the under- and over-valuation of the role of highways are combined with each other. In our opinion, highways have strong, if not the strongest economic stimulus effect and settlements bordering highways formulate a single, coherent cluster. In general, these areas belong to the more developed areas of the country, which have better employment, income and infrastructure conditions. Currently, Hungary has strongly central and radial transport network. This structure hinders the formation and strengthening of large rural cities, as the capital city is the political and economic centre of the country, and its central location makes it easily accessible from the major part of the country.

The analysis utilises cross-regional survey data and qualitative interviews. Results suggest the absence of a subsistence poverty trap driven by either farmer perceptions or transactions costs although capital endowment appears to play a significant part.

Horizon 2020, the Eighth Framework Programme with its 80 billion euro budget {{is a very important}} player in science funding. At the same time, due to the economic crisis and limited state budget for research and technology, national governments gladly encourage their scientists to apply for funds on the European level.

40|$|This paper explores and {{analyzes}} farmers’ risk perceptions, {{risk management}} instruments’ demand and usage in five <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> (<b>Hungary,</b> Spain, the Netherlands, Germany and Poland). A survey completed by 1047 representative farmers of these EU Member Status collected information that {{allowed us to}} set apart two focus areas: the first looks at the declared importance of several sources of farms’ risk and income instability, and at the actual means that farmers pursue to manage and face them. The second area focuses on the demand for risk management instruments. The paper’s objective {{is to determine the}} factors that explain farmers’ responses in the first area, and based on those factors, analyse the demands for two instruments (insurance, and future & option markets). After carrying out basic descriptive statistic analyses, we perform factor analysis in order to establish the linkages between the perceptions and ranking of risks with the declared strategies to manage them. Logit models were fit to determine potential demand of insurance, and futures & options based on the three factors, and other variables like activity types and other controls, like nationality. Results from the factor analysis show that the perception of risk and actual use of risk management are very diverse. Logit models show that insurance is clearly an alternative instrument to diversification, but its demand is poorly explained by the other factors. Furthermore the demand for the use of futures and options is explained by the three factors, with the volatility factor, positively linked; market access /contractual risks; and diversification, negatively linked. In conclusion, policy makers should proceed with caution selecting the most adequate risk management instruments for farmers. It appears that the expected demand of risk management tools does not fit perfectly with the stated perception of risks. risk, risk management, farmer’s perception., Risk and Uncertainty,...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze the relationship between the structural funds provided by the European Union (EU) and the real convergence of the New <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> that joined the EU in 2004. We also assess the effect of the crisis on this. According to the empirical studies in this area, the impact can be both negative and positive. Furthermore, in the latter case, the correlation is not very strong and depends on several factors. To meet the research objective, we have structured this paper into five parts. In the first part, we make a short presentation of the Cohesion policy and its evolution in time. In the second part, we explore the importance of the subject in the economic literature. In the third one, we explain the methodology used in this paper. We contribute to the literature by creating a Real Convergence Index (RCI) and by assessing the evolution of this index and of the structural funds payments from 2004 until 2010 in five New <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> (<b>Hungary,</b> the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia). The fourth part describes the results obtained. The structural funds payments reached a maximum level in 2007 in all the countries, with the exception of Slovenia. After this point, they recorded decreasing levels, mainly because of the economic and financial crisis. Within this group of countries, Poland and Slovakia recorded an increase in RCI during 2009 and 2010, even though the amounts of payments started decreasing. The highest level of structural funds payments and the maximum level of RCI are not synchronized, with the exception of the Czech Republic. This could come as a result of the lagging effects of structural funds on the economic convergence. The fifth part of the paper summarizes the conclusions of our research. The analysis confirms the previous work in this field. Specifically, it does not provide us with a clear result regarding the relationship between the absorption of structural funds and the real convergence. The implications for Romania are not very encouraging. This means that the efforts for increasing the absorption rate of EU funds will not necessarily lead to a faster real convergence process. Consequently, the effectiveness of the Cohesion policy remains under question...|$|R

The study highlights those issues that are the most characteristic in terms of the level of information, management, marketing and finance. As a conclusion, it can be stated that the level of management of Hungarian agricultural holdings is lagging behind the practice in the European Union and the possibilities offered by science. The main reasons for that can be derived from the inadequate education system, leisureliness of farmers, inconsistency of agricultural policy, the inadequate preparation of the EU accession, and the imperfect institutional background of agriculture. tudástranszfer, kockázat menedzsment, felmérés, szaktanácsadás, knowledge transfer, risk management, survey, extension, Agribusiness, Risk and Uncertainty, Teaching/Communication/Extension/Profession,...|$|R

Second, we apply vector autoregressive analysis and Granger tests of temporal ordering (”causality tests”) to determine whether the sale of one retail chain is followed in a predictable way by the sale of another retail chain or its own later sales. Our results suggest a dual retail market structure. Finally, we employ panel cointegration to test confirm that durable goods should have qualitatively different pricing pattern than less-durable goods. Similarly to Berck et al.

The empirical results show that within a selected group of EU <b>member</b> <b>states</b> Denmark, <b>Hungary</b> and Portugal are seen as most efficient in primary education sector. The efficient countries are also Greece and Romania, however, their primary expenditures per student (in % of GDP) is very low and have averaged less than 12 % (the EU/OECD average is 18. 7 % in the considered period). In addition, some countries come very close to the frontier (e. g. Czech R.), while the other countries are further away and therefore less efficient (e. g. Croatia). On the other hand, the least efficient countries are Belgium, Sweden and Croatia. Some less efficient countries should significantly decrease their input (primary expenditure per student) (e. g. Slovenia from 27. 0 % to 22. 0 %) and/or increase their outputs, i. e. school enrolment (e. g.

The main objective is to test for the existence and determine the degree of the four states’ financial integration relative to the euro currency union. The analysis is performed at the country level (using national stock-exchange indices) and at the sectoral level (considering banking, chemical, electricity, and telecommunication indices). Our empirical evaluation consists of (1) a harmonization analysis (by means of standard and rolling correlation analysis) to outline the overall pattern of integration; (2) the application of the concept of beta convergence (through the use of time series, panel, and state-space techniques) to identify the speed of integration; and (3) the application of so-called sigma convergence to measure the degree of integration. We find evidence of respective stock-market integration on both national and sectoral levels between the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and the euro area. beta convergence, new EU <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> sigma convergence, stock markets...|$|R
5000|$|European {{questions}} {{continued to}} dominated Luxembourg's foreign policy. The period from 1999 to 2004 {{was devoted to}} enlargement of the European Union and institutional reforms that went with it. On 16 April 2003 in Athens, 10 new <b>member</b> <b>states</b> (Estonia, <b>Hungary,</b> Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Cyprus and Malta) signed the treaty of accession. Their admission came into force on 1 May 2004. The European Union now counted 455 million residents. This evolution confirmed the government's conviction that despite its small size, Luxembourg had {{to make all the}} more efforts to impose its presence on the international scene as the European Union grew. Luxembourgish diplomacy intensified its work not only in the old <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> but also in the new <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> Luxembourg supported an EU policy aimed at reinforcing the European institutions and their decision-making capacities. Luxembourgish representatives participated in the Convention {{on the future of the}} European Union which resulted in the proposed Constitution for Europe. From 27 June 2003, the government took the decision to proceed with the ratification of the future European Constitution - once signed by the 25 heads of state or government - by a national referendum. But at the same time, Luxembourg did not intend to surrender important rights such as the right to a Commissioner, the right to the presidency of the Council of Ministers and an adequate representation in the European Parliament. While it did not deny the necessity for a weighting by population size, it defended the principle of equality between <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> At the Council of Nice, in December 2000, the Union came to an agreement which was also satisfactory for Luxembourg. The Treaty of Nice, signed on 26 February 2001, maintained one Commissioner per <b>member</b> <b>state.</b> Following the new distribution of votes, Luxembourg now had four votes in the Council of Ministers and continued to send six members to the European Parliament.|$|R
