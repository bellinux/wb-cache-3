5|$|The shoulder-fired {{personal}} defense {{weapon was}} to weigh less than 3kg (6.6lb), with a <b>magazine</b> <b>capacity</b> {{of at least}} 20 rounds.|$|E
5|$|There is {{currently}} no restriction on caliber size and no restriction on <b>magazine</b> <b>capacity.</b> However, special safe storage requirements apply for those {{having more than}} 500, 10,000 and 20,000 bullets.|$|E
5|$|The {{handheld}} personal defense weapon (pistol) was {{to weigh}} less than 1kg (2.2lb), although a weight of 700g (1.5lb) was deemed desirable; {{it was to}} have a <b>magazine</b> <b>capacity</b> of at least 20 rounds.|$|E
25|$|Listed <b>magazine</b> <b>capacities</b> are for full-capacity factory magazines; <b>magazine</b> <b>capacities</b> may {{be limited}} to 10 rounds in some locations, and {{extended}} aftermarket magazines may hold more than the listed quantity.|$|R
5000|$|The Walther P99 was {{modified}} several times throughout its production history, {{as were the}} magazines. When the P99 was introduced the <b>magazine</b> <b>capacities</b> were 16 rounds for 9×19mm Parabellum and 12 rounds for [...]40 S&W. Magazines had witness holes on both sides. Later the <b>magazine</b> <b>capacities</b> were reduced to 15 rounds for 9×19mm Parabellum and 10 rounds for [...]40 S&W while witness holes were introduced {{at the rear of}} the magazine to view the loading condition.|$|R
5000|$|The pistol {{was dropped}} from {{production}} in 1996 due to lackluster sales {{and the availability}} of smaller pistols with higher <b>magazine</b> <b>capacities</b> chambered in [...]40 S&W.|$|R
5|$|A {{modified}} version of the standard MP 40 (sometimes erroneously called MP 40/II) with a dual side-by-side magazine holder (for a theoretical ammunition total of 64 rounds), designed for special operations troops on the Eastern Front to compensate for the enemies' PPSh-41 larger <b>magazine</b> <b>capacity.</b> However, the design proved unsuccessful due to weight and reliability issues.|$|E
5|$|The {{vertical}} triple expansion engines consumed {{large amounts}} of internal space that could otherwise {{have been used for}} magazines. Without sufficient <b>magazine</b> <b>capacity</b> to support superfiring centerline turrets, designers were compelled to distribute six main turrets in an unusual hexagonal configuration. Two twin turrets were mounted fore and aft (one on each end), and two were mounted on each flank of the ship. Firing directly forward and aft, the ships could bring 6 guns to bear, and 8 on the broadside; this was the same theoretical capability as Dreadnought, but the Nassau-class ships required two additional guns to achieve it. It was considered that this arrangement provided a useful reserve of heavy guns that were shielded from enemy fire.|$|E
25|$|Shorter barrel, slide, {{and more}} compact frame (13-round <b>magazine</b> <b>capacity).</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Magazine</b> <b>capacities</b> {{available}} for the 90-Two 9×19mm are: 10-round single-stack, 15 or 17-round double-stack; the 90-Two 9×21mm IMI: 15 round double-stack, the 90-Two [...]40 S&W: 10 or 12 round double-stack.|$|R
50|$|Though the Hi-Point pistols {{have been}} criticized for their weight, the empty or {{unloaded}} weight of the CF-380 is 29 oz, making its weight comparable to other pistols with similar <b>magazine</b> <b>capacities.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Arms (Military Style Semi-automatic Firearms and Import Controls) Amendment Act 2012" [...] {{aimed to}} clarify the MSSA {{definition}} in regards to Airsoft and Paintball guns, as well as <b>magazine</b> <b>capacities.</b>|$|R
25|$|A compact {{version with}} a {{shortened}} barrel and slide and 13-round <b>magazine</b> <b>capacity</b> {{known as the}} 92SB Compact was manufactured from 1981 to 1991.|$|E
25|$|The Colt 2000 or All American 2000 is a polymer or aluminum-alloy framed, locked-breech, rotary bolt, semiautomatic 9 mm handgun with a <b>magazine</b> <b>capacity</b> of 15 rounds {{manufactured}} by Colt.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, Heller {{voted against}} {{legislature}} to limit gun <b>magazine</b> <b>capacity,</b> ban assault weapons and to expand {{background checks on}} gun sales at gun shows and made on the internet. In the past he has supported more restrictive background checks but voted against them due to fear that a national gun registry could be created.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} types of {{magazines}} for the Ruger 10/22. The standard 10/22 ships with a black 10-round rotary magazine, the BX-1. Ruger has also produced a clear polycarbonate ("40th-anniversary edition") BX-1CLR magazine, {{as well as a}} five-round rotary magazine (for states or countries that restrict <b>magazine</b> <b>capacities).</b> In 2011-2012 Ruger came out with the Ruger BX-25, a 25-round box magazine with a black composite frame and steel feed lips, as well as the 15-round BX-15 box magazine for states that restrict <b>magazine</b> <b>capacities.</b> Aftermarket options include 25-, 30-, and 50-round box magazines; 50-round teardrop-shaped rotary magazines, and 50- and 110-round drum magazines.|$|R
5000|$|The CZ-G2000 is {{a handgun}} created by CZ-Guns Trade and {{exported}} by Arms Moravia. It can be chambered for 9×19mm Luger and [...]40 S&W with different <b>magazine</b> <b>capacities.</b> In Germany, it's {{known as the}} CUG-2000.|$|R
50|$|Like all {{semi-automatic}} rifles {{with features}} such as pistol grips and flash suppressors, L1A1s are classified as military-style semi-automatics, requiring a special permit to own them. <b>Magazine</b> <b>capacities</b> for other centrefire semi-automatics are limited to seven rounds.|$|R
25|$|The first {{designs were}} criticized {{as having a}} slow and {{cumbersome}} firing mechanism. The shells had to be individually loaded and then the drum wound by a clockwork mechanism. Shell ejection was by an ejector rod along the right hand side of the barrel. The last version has the clockwork winding mechanism removed, the ejector rod {{has been replaced by}} an automatic ejection system and in the rod's place is a cocking lever that winds the drum automatically. The Striker design has a twelve-round <b>magazine</b> <b>capacity</b> and short overall length. Compact variants have 7 rounds.|$|E
25|$|These {{were known}} as the Mk IB: Mk Is armed with eight Brownings were {{retrospectively}} called the Mk Ia. With the early cannon installation, jamming was a serious problem. In one engagement, {{only two of the}} 12 aircraft had been able to fire off all of their ammunition. Further cannon-armed Spitfires, with improvements to the cannon mounts, were later issued to 92 Squadron, but due to the limited <b>magazine</b> <b>capacity</b> it was eventually decided the best armament mix was two cannon and four machine guns (most of these were later converted to the first Mk VBs).|$|E
25|$|Starting in {{the early}} 2000s, {{the rapid growth of}} {{legislation}} and regulations allowing concealed carry by law-abiding citizens in various jurisdictions created a large market for handguns manufactured specifically for such use. Desirable characteristics for firearms of this type include: small size, thinness, high <b>magazine</b> <b>capacity,</b> lightweight construction (often achieved through the use of polymer frames), stealthy darkened stainless steel slides, high visibility and/or night sights, and large ergonomic ambidextrous manual thumb safeties and magazine releases. Ruger specifically designed the SR9 pistol to address the very active and profitable concealed-carry handgun market segment and it possesses the majority of the aforementioned attributes.|$|E
50|$|The rifle is {{most often}} used with a 10-round box <b>magazine,</b> {{although}} larger <b>capacity</b> <b>magazines</b> are also available.|$|R
25|$|As the French {{became more}} desperate, the {{procurement}} process spiraled out of control. Eventually Gabilondo contracted with another three companies {{and at least}} 45 other companies contracted with the French directly to produce Ruby-type pistols {{in a variety of}} calibres, barrel lengths and <b>magazine</b> <b>capacities.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1994 the U.S. {{government}} banned {{manufacture and}} importation of pistol magazines {{with more than}} a 10-round capacity. These were the so-called [...] "high-capacity" [...] magazines, which again became legal to manufacture and import in most states in September 2004, after the relevant federal law expired. This change in federal law rendered many staggered-magazine pistol models (commonly with <b>magazine</b> <b>capacities</b> of 15 or more rounds) less popular in the American market. They were now overly large in light of their newly mandated 10-shot limit. Kahr was at the forefront, offering relatively small, well-made pistols with <b>magazine</b> <b>capacities</b> of up to eight rounds of 9mm or [...]40-caliber ammunition. These single-stack magazines allow for slender, compact pistols that have proven popular with the buying public.|$|R
25|$|Where a vehicle, {{such as the}} M50 Ontos, used {{multiple}} barrels, spotting rifles {{were usually}} provided for each barrel so that each could be accurately boresighted to its own barrel. The Ontos used six barrels with four spotting rifles; two without, to avoid making an already tall vehicle even higher. This provision may have been over-generous, although it did also increase the <b>magazine</b> <b>capacity</b> available for repeated ranging shots. Many photographs of the Ontos in service in Vietnam show it with {{only two of the}} spotting rifles installed in their mounts. The Ontos also often only carried four or even two main gun tubes.|$|E
25|$|The Glock 17 feeds from staggered-column or {{double stack}} {{magazines}} {{that have a}} 17-round capacity (which can be extended to 19 with an optional floor plate) or optional 33-round high-capacity magazines. For jurisdictions which restrict <b>magazine</b> <b>capacity</b> to 10 rounds, Glock offers single-stack, 10-round magazines. The magazines are made of steel and are overmolded with plastic. A steel spring drives a plastic follower. After the last cartridge has been fired, the slide remains open on the slide stop. The slide stop release lever {{is located on the}} left side of the frame directly beneath the slide and can be manipulated by the thumb of the right-handed shooter.|$|E
25|$|One of the Bizon's {{more unusual}} {{features}} is the magazine, {{which is often}} mistaken for a grenade launcher. The cylinder below the barrel {{is in fact a}} 64-round helical-feed magazine, similar to the type used in the American Calico M960 submachine gun. The magazine is made from a durable glass-reinforced polyamide and mounts under the handguard in line with the barrel. This layout makes the weapon more compact and concealable. All cartridges are aligned nose forward in the Bizon magazine and cannot be loaded incorrectly. Early magazines were fabricated from aluminium tubing and had a capacity of 67 rounds. The production <b>magazine</b> <b>capacity</b> of 64 was selected as 64 is a multiple of 16, and 9×18mm Makarov rounds are packaged in boxes of 16. The magazine has hooks on top of the front end that engage a pair of pins under the front sight, and the rear end of the magazine interfaces with a Kalashnikov pattern spring-loaded paddle type magazine catch/release located in front of the trigger guard. Some magazines were produced with indicator holes allowing the user to verify the amount of ammunition loaded; these are spaced at 4, 24, 44 and 64-round increments.|$|E
50|$|Though the C-9, C-9 Compensated, {{and other}} Hi-Point handguns {{have been criticized}} for their weight, the empty or {{unloaded}} weight of the C-9 has been trimmed from 29 oz to 25 oz by using a polymer frame, making its weight comparable to other pistols with similar <b>magazine</b> <b>capacities.</b>|$|R
5000|$|CZ 2075 RAMI: A subcompact {{version of}} the CZ 75 {{intended}} for concealed carry. Features a 3-inch barrel, aluminum frame and low-profile sights. Available in 9×19mm or [...]40 S&W, with standard <b>magazine</b> <b>capacities</b> of 10 (9×19mm) and 8 (.40 S&W) rounds, respectively. An optional 14-round magazine is available for the 9 mm version.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the larger}} size of the Nike Hercules, an {{underground}} <b>magazine's</b> <b>capacity</b> was reduced to eight missiles. Thus, storage racks, launcher rails, and elevators underwent modification to accept the larger missiles. Two additional features that readily distinguished newly converted sites were the double fence and the kennels housing dogs that patrolled the perimeter between the two fences.|$|R
500|$|Includes semi {{automatic}} and single or multiple shot handguns, revolvers, {{semi automatic}} rifles and shotguns with <b>magazine</b> <b>capacity</b> over 3 rounds {{or with a}} detachable magazine, semi automatic [...] "military" [...] style rifles, rim-fire firearms under 280 mm of length and all shotguns under 600 mm of length, flare guns with caliber larger than 16mm.|$|E
500|$|The British Army {{was armed}} with the Short Magazine Lee–Enfield Mk III (SMLE Mk III), which {{featured}} a bolt-action and large <b>magazine</b> <b>capacity</b> that enabled a trained rifleman to fire 20–30 aimed rounds a minute. World War I accounts tell of British troops repelling German attackers, who subsequently {{reported that they had}} encountered machine guns, when in fact, it was simply a group of trained riflemen armed with SMLEs. The heavy Vickers machine gun proved itself to be the most reliable weapon on the battlefield, with some of its feats of endurance entering military mythology. One account tells of the action by the 100th Company of the Machine Gun Corps at High Wood on 24 August 1916. This company had 10 Vickers guns; it was ordered to give sustained covering fire for 12 hours onto a selected area [...] away, to prevent German troops forming up there for a counterattack while a British attack was in progress. Two companies of infantry were allocated as ammunition, rations and water carriers for the gunners. Two men worked a belt–filling machine non–stop for 12 hours, keeping up a supply of 250-round belts. They used 100 new barrels and all of the water—including the men's drinking water and the contents of the latrine buckets—to keep the guns cool. In that 12-hour period, the 10 guns fired just short of one million rounds between them. One team is reported to have fired 120,000. At the close of the operation, it is alleged that every gun was working perfectly and that not one had broken down during the whole period.|$|E
2500|$|Bizon-2-02: Chambered in the [...]380 ACP (9×17mm Short) pistol round (64-round helical <b>magazine</b> <b>capacity).</b>|$|E
50|$|After World War I, {{acceptance}} of the 9×19mm Parabellum chambering increased, and 9×19mm Parabellum pistols and submachine guns were adopted by military and police users in many countries. The 9×19mm Parabellum {{has become the most}} popular caliber for U.S. law enforcement agencies, primarily due to the availability of compact pistols with large <b>magazine</b> <b>capacities</b> that use the cartridge.|$|R
50|$|The Calico M960 is a 9×19mm (Luger/Parabellum) caliber {{semi-automatic}} carbine (fully automatic {{versions are}} {{available only to}} authorized law enforcement and military), manufactured by Calico Light Weapons Systems. Its features include its high-capacity, cylindrical, helical-feed magazine and retractable stock. This method allows <b>magazine</b> <b>capacities</b> of 50 and 100 rounds in a relatively small space. The rear sight is mounted {{as part of the}} plastic magazine shell.|$|R
5|$|The PS90 is a carbine {{version of}} the P90, {{intended}} for civilian shooters for personal protection and sporting use; it was introduced in 2005, {{and continues to be}} offered in several configurations. The PS90 will accept the standard 50-round P90 magazines, but the gun is supplied with a magazine that is blocked to a capacity of 10 or 30 rounds, allowing it to be sold in jurisdictions where <b>magazine</b> <b>capacities</b> are restricted by law.|$|R
