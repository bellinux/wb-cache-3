5|$|In August, Wartensleben's {{autonomous}} corps {{united with}} Charles' imperial troops {{and turned the}} tide against the French. The defeat of Jourdan's army at the battles of Amberg (24 August), Würzburg (3 September) and 2nd Altenkirchen (16–19 September) allowed Charles to move <b>more</b> <b>troops</b> to the south, and effectively removed Jourdan from {{the remainder of the}} campaign.|$|E

5|$|After {{scattering}} the Americans at Kip's Bay, Howe landed 9,000 <b>more</b> <b>troops,</b> but did {{not immediately}} cut off the American retreat from New York Town {{in the south of}} the island. Washington had all of his troops in the city on their way to north along the westside of Manhattan to Harlem Heights by 4:00 pm and they all reached the fortifications on the Heights by nightfall.|$|E
5|$|At this juncture, the Roman empire was convulsed by {{its first}} major civil war since the Battle of Actium exactly a century earlier: the Year of the Four Emperors (69-70 AD). The {{governor}} of Germania Inferior, ordered to raise <b>more</b> <b>troops,</b> outraged the Batavi {{by attempting to}} conscript more Batavi than the maximum stipulated in their treaty. The brutality and corruption of the Roman recruiting-centurions (including incidents of sexual assault on Batavi young men) brought already deep discontent in the Batavi homeland to the boil.|$|E

50|$|The war caused {{unprecedented}} {{upheaval in}} the area. Atlantic Canada witnessed more population movements, more fortification construction, and <b>more</b> <b>troop</b> allocations than ever before. Twenty-four conflicts were recorded {{during the war}} (battles, raids, skirmishes), 13 of which were Mi'kmaq and Acadian raids on the capital region Halifax/ Dartmouth. As typical of frontier warfare, many additional conflicts were unrecorded.|$|R

5|$|During the 1830s, the Mexican {{government}} wavered between federalist and centralist policies. As {{the pendulum}} swung sharply towards centralism in 1835, several Mexican states revolted. In June, {{a small group}} of settlers in Texas used the political unrest as an excuse to rebel against customs duties, in an incident known as the Anahuac Disturbances. The federal government responded by sending <b>more</b> <b>troops</b> to Texas.|$|E
5|$|Hood's {{withdrawal}} to Barbados {{had left}} St Lucia exposed, and on 10May, the whole French fleet, less two ships-of-the-line landed 1200 troops at Gros Islet, a village {{at the northern}} end of the island. On the same day, the remaining two ships from the French fleet and 1300 troops sailed for Tobago. The British were able to repel the attacks on St Lucia so deGrasse decided to reinforce his attack on Tobago, diverting his fleet there on 25May and sending 3000 <b>more</b> <b>troops</b> from Martinique.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, Pierlot began {{drawing up}} {{plans for the}} {{reorganization}} of the Belgian Army after the liberation, known as the Pierlot Plan (Plan Pierlot). The plan called {{for the formation of}} two brigades of infantry, six battalions of fusiliers, logistics and support units in Belgium immediately after liberation in order to fight alongside Allied troops during an invasion of Germany. In the longer term, these troops would form the core of a new division around which <b>more</b> <b>troops</b> could be raised.|$|E

25|$|According to scholar Page Fortna, {{there is}} strong {{evidence}} {{that the presence of}} peacekeepers significantly reduces the risk of renewed warfare; <b>more</b> peacekeeping <b>troops</b> leads to fewer battlefield deaths; and <b>more</b> peacekeeping <b>troops</b> leads to fewer civilian deaths. There is also evidence that the promise to deploy peacekeepers can help an international organizations bring combatants to the negotiation table and increase the likelihood that they will agree to a cease-fire.|$|R
50|$|Major Sebastien Morley {{resigned}} {{after four}} soldiers {{under his command}} were killed whilst serving in the Army's Snatch Land Rovers which are lightly armoured and cannot withstand roadside bombs; the Snatches {{have been described as}} 'mobile coffins' by the soldiers.

5|$|In September and October 1945 Europeans and pro-Dutch Eurasians were {{attacked}} {{and killed by}} Indonesian mobs. Ferocious fighting erupted when 6,000 British Indian troops landed in the city. Sukarno and Hatta negotiated a ceasefire between the Republicans and the British forces led by Brigadier Mallaby. Following the killing of Mallaby on 30 October, the British sent <b>more</b> <b>troops</b> into the city from 10 November {{under the cover of}} air attacks. Although the European forces largely captured the city in three days, the poorly armed Republicans fought on until 29 November and thousands died as the population fled to the countryside.|$|E

With {{the bulk of}} both armies wiped out and Lazar and Murad killed, {{the outcome of the}} battle was inconclusive. In its {{aftermath}} the Serbs had insufficient manpower to defend their lands, while the Turks had many <b>more</b> <b>troops</b> in the east. Serbian principalities which were not already Ottoman vassals became such over the next few years.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the morning, the Germans mopped up British {{survivors}} and stragglers in hiding around Arnhem bridge. It took several hours {{to clear the}} bridge of debris allowing German armour to cross and reinforce Nijmegen. Crucially, the British had held the bridge long enough to allow Nijmegen bridge to be captured by the 82nd Airborne and Guards' Armoured Division working together. With the resistance at the bridge crushed, the Germans had <b>more</b> <b>troops</b> available to commit to the Oosterbeek engagement, although this changed suddenly in the afternoon.|$|E
50|$|Skirmishes {{between the}} {{communities}} continued {{for almost a}} week.

5|$|As the {{occupation}} duties were accomplished, {{the occupation}} force continued to downsize as <b>more</b> <b>troops</b> returned home and their units were inactivated. By 1950, the Sixth Army had left Japan, and the occupation force {{was reduced to}} the Eighth United States Army commanding two corps and four under-strength divisions; the I Corps, commanding the 24th Infantry Division and 25th Infantry Division, and the IX Corps, commanding the 1st Cavalry Division and the 7th Infantry Division. IX Corps had been moved to Sendai as the occupation forces shifted {{as a result of}} the downsizing. As part of further downsizing, IX Corps was inactivated on 28 March 1950, and its command responsibilities were consolidated with other units.|$|E
5|$|At 15:30 the two battalions of the Turkish 77th Infantry Regiment were in position, {{and with}} the 27th Infantry they counter-attacked again. At 15:30 and at 16:45 McCay, now under severe pressure, {{requested}} reinforcements. The second time he was informed {{there was only one}} uninvolved battalion left, the 4th, and Bridges was keeping them in reserve until <b>more</b> <b>troops</b> from the New Zealand and Australian Division had been landed. McCay then spoke to Bridges direct and informed him the situation was desperate and if not reinforced the Turks would get behind him. At 17:00 Bridges released the 4th Battalion to McCay who sent them to the south forming on the left of the 8th Battalion along Bolton's Ridge. They arrived just in time to help counter Turkish probing attacks, by the 27th Infantry Regiment, from the south.|$|E

As Balon heads outside, he encounters his brother, Euron Greyjoy, who has come to overthrow him. Balon attempts to stab Euron, who throws him off a bridge to his death. At Balon's funeral, Yara swears revenge against Balon's killer, but is reminded by her uncle Aeron, a Drowned Priest, that her position as successor depends on the results of the Kingsmoot, a ceremony where the Ironborn elect their new leader.|$|E

5|$|By 354/353 BC, in just 5 {{years since}} his accession, Philip had unified Macedon {{and turned it}} into the {{dominant}} power in Northern Greece. He had completely reduced Athenian influence in the region, and was allied to the other major Greek power in the region, the Chalkidian League. He had, in the process, secured access to the Aegean sea, which had been an age-old problem in Macedon, since suitable sites had been monopolised by Greek colonists in the Archaic period. Furthermore, he had overhauled and re-trained the army, which was now battle-hardened, and he now had a supply of ready money to pay for <b>more</b> <b>troops.</b>|$|E
5|$|Crossing the Aegean, Demetrius {{made for}} the coast of Caria, whence he called upon the Rhodians to join him, per their {{alliance}} with his father.

This {{was accompanied by a}} fleet numbering 53 heavy ships—7 heptereis, 10 hexereis, 20 quinqueremes—and upwards of 110 lighter vessels—triremes and quadriremes—although the exact numbers are somewhat unclear. He was opposed by Ptolemy's brother, Menelaus, who disposed of 12,000 infantry, 800 cavalry, and 60 ships.|$|E
