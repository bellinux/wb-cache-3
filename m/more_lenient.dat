5|$|A {{study in}} 2011 by Douglas Miller {{shows that in}} English county cricket, the {{proportion}} of wickets to fall lbw has increased steadily since the First World War. In the 1920s, around 11% of wickets were lbw but this rose to 14% in the 1930s. Between 1946 and 1970, the proportion was approximately 11% but subsequently increased until reaching almost 19% in the decade before 2010. Miller also states that captains of county teams were statistically more likely to receive the benefit of lbw decisions—less likely to be out lbw when batting {{and more likely to}} dismiss batsmen lbw when bowling. For many years, county captains submitted end-of-match reports on the umpires; as umpires were professionals whose careers could be affected, captains consequently received leeway whether batting or bowling. Before 1963, when the status was abolished in county cricket, umpires were also <b>more</b> <b>lenient</b> towards amateur cricketers. Amateurs administered English cricket, and offending one could end an umpire's career. Elsewhere in the world, lbws are more statistically likely in matches taking place on the Indian subcontinent.

In our research, we used cross-classified models to study rater {{effects in the}} real essay rating process of a large-scale, high-stakes educational examination administered in China in 2011.

We applied these models to the data to account for possible cluster effects caused by the application of multiple rating strategies.

Giandonato Rogadeo, an eminent European jurist, was requested to come to Malta in 1781 by de Rohan to address issues related to common law. Rogadeo went on to author the Diritto Municipale, between the year of his arrival and 1784, a law book to be used for the Castellania. During his stay in Malta, he further observed that it was not the law which was just problematic but also the judges and advocates which were corrupt. His work was opposed by the advocates and judges, with Baron Gaetano Pisani and Judge Gio Nicoló Muscat anonymously publishing works in Rome in 1783 to challenge it and aiming to keep the status quo which had limited considerations. It became the primarily Maltese law of the Code de Rohan, a humane set of laws, which brought significant reformation to criminal law. The Code incorporated previous laws introduced from former Grand Masters with a more liberal approach. It also set standard regulations for advocates, with some flexibility. It was subsequently amended with the use of bandi. The Diritto Municipale was abolished in 1854, during the British period, and replaced by a <b>more</b> <b>lenient</b> Criminal Code.|$|E

In addition to his duties as councillor, Chamberlain helped recruit men for the Royal Warwickshire Regiment and set up funds for injured soldiers. Late in 1914, he became an alderman of Birmingham, and the following year, became Lord Mayor. Chamberlain's biographer, Robert Self, suggested that as Joseph Chamberlain had died the previous year, the honour was due to Neville Chamberlain's hard work rather than to any family influence. As a Lord Mayor in wartime, Chamberlain had a tremendous burden of work, and he insisted that his councillors and officials work equally hard. He set up crèches for workers, stockpiled coal to be distributed to the poor at cost in time of shortage, and reinvigorated Birmingham's various committees, which were ineffective and engaged in wasteful rivalries. He also chaired the local committee evaluating exemptions from conscription, and stated that he was <b>more</b> <b>lenient</b> than were other members of the tribunal.

One remedy, proposed by the Energy Intensive Industries is to combine free emission allowances with a pricing of electricity whereby energy emissions and transmission costs are bundled and sold on an average cost basis. The paper attempts to model this proposal. We cast the problem in a spatial model of the power sector where generators can develop new capacities, the transmission system is organized on a flowgate basis, emission allowances are auctioned, except possibly for industries, and traded. The consumer market is decomposed in two segments. Industries purchase electricity according to some form of average cost price, the rest of the market is supplied at marginal cost. These equilibrium models are non convex. We present the models and discuss their properties.

40|$|Thesis (M. A., Sociology) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2012 There are {{a growing}} number of studies into the subject of female sexual {{offenders}} and how they are perceived. In the past, the concept of female sexual offenders was considered an oddity and rarity; but is now recognized as occurring more frequently than previously thought. Past studies examined the perceptions of students about educators who sexually offend. This paper, however, examines the perception given by newspaper articles concerning educators who sexually offend. This is a quantitative content analysis of the adjectives used by newspaper reporters {{to see if there is}} bias in how they report female and male educations who sexually offend. The source of the data is from the ProQuest newspaper online database. ProQuest catalogs 721 newspapers from the United States as well as 139 newspapers published in the United Kingdom. The newspapers used for this study span between 2002 - 2011. Using crosstabulations, a quantitative content analysis was conducted. There are four key findings. First, the data show that newspapers will label male educators as predators more often than their female counterpart. Second, newspapers use <b>more</b> gentle and <b>lenient</b> language in their description of female educators who sexual abuse their students. Third, newspapers will use the term mentally ill more often in their description of female sexual offenders than a male sexual offender. These three key findings supports that the use of inflammatory descriptive terms or placating terms is dependent upon the gender of the offender and not the seriousness of their crime. In addition to these findings, this study also shows that American newspapers use more inflammatory language toward educators who sexually offend while United Kingdom newspapers use more innocuous terms. This may be attributed to the fact that it has only been since 2003 that sexual crimes against children by educators are treated more seriously by the Crown Prosecutors. Sociolog...|$|R

40|$|The {{first chapter}} {{experimentally}} examine repeated partnerships with imperfect monitoring, where participants can unilaterally sever partnerships at any time. The experiment examines effects from {{changes in the}} value of an outside-the-partnership option. We find four main results where partners have access to the same outside option: i) the presence of a dissolution option increases cooperation; ii) the use of dissolution is dictated by individual rationality; iii) where dissolution is used as a punishment, subjects increases lenience, but are still forgiving; iv) overall efficiency is non-monotone in the outside option. An extension examines asymmetric outside options finding: advantages to terminating first-movers creates highly inefficient outcomes; a last-mover advantage is less inefficient but reduces forgiveness; while an arbitrator-mechanism assigning higher payoffs to "more-deserving" parties increases efficiency. The second chapter experimentally investigates the effects from adding a simple and intuitive stage before the start of a repeated partnership, where agents communicate about strategies they intend to play. Varying the bindingness of the message sent in the preplay communication, I examine the efficiency gain of adding these two communication institutions and behavior of senders and receivers in each of them. I find that adding both forms of preplay communication increases cooperation and efficiency in the ensuing repeated partnership. In particular, when the communication is binding, i. e. senders formulate specify strategies as contracts, the efficiency of the repeated partnership is highest. Moreover, I find that <b>more</b> cooperative and <b>lenient</b> strategies are sent and receivers are more cooperative in partnerships governed by contracts. The third chapter analyzes the sales method for a sample of 575 M&A deals announced between 1998 and 2012 and find that targets use auctions to increase the probability of finding bidders that can relax their financial constraints rather than to create operational synergies. Auctions, compared to negotiated deals, are associated with significantly higher target announcement returns, especially for relatively small targets. Bidder returns are positively related to auctions for bidders acquiring relatively small targets, not for the full sample. Taking into account size differences, we find that auctions, decrease target gains and increase bidder gains expressed in dollars...|$|R
