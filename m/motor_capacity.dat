With the feeble-minded {{children of the}} said school and the children exceptionally high in I. Q. of both Primary and Junior High Schools attached to the Osaka Liberal Arts University {{as the object of}} the present　survey, a comparative study is made in order to seek relationship between intelligence and general <b>motor</b> <b>capacities</b> shown by children of two extreme types. The main items treated in the present study are as follows : 1. Relation between intelligence and both stature and weight. 2. Relation between intelligence and capacities in running, jumping and throwing. 3. Relation between intelligence and such capacities as quickness, precision, equilibrium, and skilfulness in action. 4. Method of surveying general athletic abilities and <b>motor</b> <b>capacities.</b> As a result of the survey, it has been ascertained that there is a close relationship between intelligence and bodily growth (starure and weight), the highly intelligent　children far surpassing the feeble-minded ones in both stature and weight. The former of both sexes, ranging from 10 to 14 of age, are decidedly superior in each stage of their growth, while the latter have a tendency of poor development. Again between intelligence and general athletic abilities, there is a close relationship just as there is between intelligence and both stature and weight. As compared with those high in I. Q., the group of children poor in intelligence are always inferior in their capacities in runninｇ, jumping and throwing, and ｆurthermore, on examination, the standard deviation with regard to their athletic capacities of the feeble-minded children likewise is greater, while that of the highly intelligent children is smaller. The same is true of the relationship between intelligence and general <b>motor</b> <b>capacities</b> just as in the preceding cases. In other words, the highly intelligent children rank far above the feeble-minded ones in almost all capacities such as quickneｓs, precision,equilibrium, and skilfulness in action.

40|$|Ethanol is an {{effective}} reinforcer but, in common with other drugs of abuse, it may derive some of its reinforcing properties from the effects it has on behaviour maintained by other reinforcers. However, any assessment of ethanol's hypothesized effect on behaviour maintained by other reinforcers {{must take into account}} the fact that ethanol may have multiple mechanisms of action. In order to address this problem the experiments reported herein used a procedure based upon Herrnstein's Matching Law which allowed joint assessment of subjects' <b>motor</b> <b>capacity</b> and reinforcer sensitivity. The effect of ethanol (0, 0. 3, and 0. 6 g/kg) on <b>motor</b> <b>capacity</b> and reinforcer sensitivity was assessed by studying behaviour maintained by monetary reinforcement. In the first experiment the procedure was validated by showing that the behaviour of subjects was sensitive to changes in reinforcer value and in the second experiment 0. 6 g/kg ethanol reduced <b>motor</b> <b>capacity</b> but did not affect reinforcer sensitivity. As a secondary hypothesis we also studied the effect of mood on reinforcer sensitivity and <b>motor</b> <b>capacity.</b> It was found that lower mood scores (lower hedonic tone) were associated with reduced reinforcer sensitivity and that male subjects showed higher <b>motor</b> <b>capacity</b> than females. However, there was also a mood by sex interaction, which indicated that higher <b>motor</b> <b>capacity</b> in males was only found in the presence of lower mood scores.

Thirty-four first grade children {{with a mean age}} of 6 years and 6 months participat-ed in the experiment with a pre and posttest design. Therefore mouse handling precision, gross and fine motor performances and number line estimation was administered before and after the intervention with a digital number line. Results. In contrast to what was expected, children that performed below the median in a gross motor task benefitted significantly more from the intervention compared to children with scores above the median for such gross motor tasks. Discussion and Conclusion. These results do not only highlight the relationship between motor development and math learning but they also show that children with lower motor ca-pacities are possibly more in need of a strong physical appearance whereby the possibilities for action are clearly visible, even in digital tools. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies show}} varying results on whether <b>motor</b> imagery <b>capacity</b> is {{compromised}} in individuals {{with cerebral palsy}} (CP). Motor imagery studies in children predominantly used the implicit hand laterality task. In this task participants judge the laterality of displayed hand stimuli. A more explicit way of studying motor imagery is mental chronometry. This paradigm {{is based on the}} comparison between the movement durations of actually performing a task and imagining the same task. The current study explored <b>motor</b> imagery <b>capacity</b> in CP by means of mental chronometry of a whole body task. Movement durations of 20 individuals with CP (mean age = 13 years, SD = 3. 6) were recorded in two conditions: actual walking and imagined walking. Six unique trajectories were used that varied in difficulty via manipulation of walking distance and path width. We found no main effect of condition (actual walking versus imagining) on movement durations. Difficulty of the walking trajectory did affect movement durations. In general, this was expressed by an increase in movement durations with increasing difficulty of the task. No interaction between task difficulty and movement condition was found. Our results show that task difficulty has similar effects on movement durations for both actual walking and imagined walking. These results exemplify that the tested individuals were able to use motor imagery in an explicit task involving walking. Previous studies using the implicit hand laterality task showed varying results on <b>motor</b> imagery <b>capacity</b> in CP. We therefore conclude that <b>motor</b> imagery <b>capacity</b> is task dependent and that an explicit paradigm as the one used in this study may reveal the true <b>motor</b> imagery <b>capacity.</b> The implications of these findings for the use of motor imagery training are discussed...|$|R

40|$|AIM: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the course of motor performance and analyse its relationship with <b>motor</b> <b>capacity</b> over a period of 3 years in 104 children (66 males, 38 females; 43 % of those initially invited) with cerebral palsy (CP) aged 9, 11, and 13 years at the start of the study. Forty-one had hemiplegia, 42 diplegia, 21 tetraplegia; 83 spastic CP, 17 dyskinetic/mixed, and four ataxic CP. Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels were I, n= 49; II, n= 15; III, n= 10; IV, n= 12; and V, n= 18. METHOD: Motor performance (what a child does do) was determined using the gross motor skills subscale of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales and <b>motor</b> <b>capacity</b> [what a child can do] was determined using the Gross Motor Function Measure- 66 (GMFM- 66). The measurements were performed annually over a period of 3 years.

Study quality of reporting was evaluated using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) criteria. Search results identified 864 articles but after review of the title and abstract only 21 articles warranted closer consideration. Ten articles met the strict inclusion criteria as nine articles did not assess HPA and two were conference abstracts. Study quality assessment (STROBE) found nine articles were good quality (≥ 60 %) and one was poor quality (55. 9 %).

In contrast, only 3 of 10 consecutive outpatients with dementia without previous stroke had abnormal riboflavin status. The data for 12 patients who did not complete 6 months of therapy or did not comply with the proposed treatment paradigm were excluded from analysis. Nineteen PD patients (8 males and 11 females, mean age ± SD = 66. 2 ± 8. 6 years; 3, 3, 2, 5, and 6 patients in Hoehn and Yahr stages I to V) received riboflavin orally (30 mg every 8 h) plus their usual symptomatic medications and all red meat was eliminated from their diet. After 1 month the riboflavin status of the patients was normalized from 106. 4 ± 34. 9 to 179. 2 ± 23 ng/ml (N = 9). <b>Motor</b> <b>capacity</b> was measured by a modification of the scoring system of Hoehn and Yahr, which reports <b>motor</b> <b>capacity</b> as percent. All 19 patients who completed 6 months of treatment showed improved <b>motor</b> <b>capacity</b> during the first three months and most reached a plateau while 5 / 19 continued to improve in the 3 - to 6 -month interval. Their average <b>motor</b> <b>capacity</b> increased from 44 to 71 % after 6 months, increasing significantly every month compared with their own pretreatment status (P < 0. 001, Wilcoxon signed rank test).

40|$|The overall aims of {{the thesis}} were to {{study the effects of}} {{goal-directed}} therapy (GDT) in children with cerebral palsy (CP) in an ecological setting, using the ICF-CY as a frame of reference, and to determine the reliability of the selective motor control (SMC) scale. Measures included in this thesis were represented in the domains of body function/structure and activity and participation. A specific interest was directed towards the SMC scale, since associations with gross motor activity have previously been detected. During the past few decades, the aim with therapy for children with CP has gradually moved from normalisation to activity and participation in meaningful life situations. Modern theories of motor development, motor control and motor learning support a treatment philosophy in which children with CP are encouraged to actively search for optimal strategies to accomplish meaningful activities and are given optimal possibilities to practice in their everyday environments. Today emphasis is also made to actively include the family. There is now growing evidence in support of GDT, even though there is a variation in the therapy setting, the level of child/family s involvement in choosing the goals and the therapy duration. A specific interest were if GDT could give beneficial effects in comparison to Activity focused therapy (AT), what the long-term effects on gross <b>motor</b> <b>capacity</b> and goal attainment were and if body functions measures (SMC, Passive Range of Motion (PROM) and Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)) were affected after GDT. The inter-rater reliability of the SMC scale was evaluated by three assessors who simultaneously and independently scored the child s ability to dorsiflex the ankle. A consecutive sample of 40 children with CP, 3 - 16 years and in GMFCS I-V, was examined. The results revealed fair/good to strong inter-rater reliability. The test-retest reliability was achieved through a second examination of 29 children at a different occasion. Weighted Kappa statistics revealed strong test-retest reliability. Comparison of GDT and AT was completed, with respect to everyday activities and gross <b>motor</b> <b>capacity.</b> Habilitation centres recruited 44 children, 1 - 6 years, 25 boys, GMFCS I-IV, MACS I-V, 27 bilateral CP and 17 unilateral CP. Focus with therapy in the GDT group (n= 22) was directed towards individualized family selected goals with participation in group training, while focus in therapy in the AT group (n= 22) was directed towards generalized aims with individualized therapy sessions. Evaluations after 12 weeks revealed significantly higher improvements in the GDT group in comparison to the AT group in both everyday activities and gross <b>motor</b> <b>capacity.</b> Longitudinal investigation of gross <b>motor</b> <b>capacity</b> (GMFM- 66) and goal attainment (GAS) in children receiving GDT (n= 22) was accomplished by repeated assessments before, during and after a 12 week period of GDT. In addition, evaluations of SMC, PROM and MAS were completed before and after therapy. The assessments of gross <b>motor</b> <b>capacity</b> before GDT were stable. During and after the 12 weeks therapy, gross <b>motor</b> <b>capacity</b> improved significantly, whereas the long-term follow-up assessments did not reveal any further improvement. The goals were gradually reached to or above the expected level at the end of therapy. The long-term follow-up assessments demonstrated a gradual progress towards higher performance, with no further change in gross <b>motor</b> <b>capacity.</b> No changes in SMC, PROM or MAS were detected. Explorations of relationships between family selected goals and scores on standardized measures were performed using the ICF-CY as a classification system. The 110 goals from children participating in GDT were used. The meaningful concept of the expected level in the goals were coded and linked to the ICF-CY. The children s baseline assessments and change scores from standardized measures were used to explore the relationships. All GAS-goals were classified in the Activity and Participation domain within ICF-CY. The number of GAS-goals in the Mobility chapter and in the Self-Care chapter correlated to baseline scores in standardized measures. The change scores in standardized measures correlated to goal attainment in the Mobility chapter and in the Self-Care chapter. Beneficial effects in gross <b>motor</b> <b>capacity</b> and everyday activity were detected after GDT. The SMC scale demonstrated moderate to strong reliability...|$|E
40|$|This study uses a {{curve-fitting}} {{approach to}} evaluate the effects of drugs on reinforced responding in rats. The subjects obtained reinforcement according {{to a series of}} five different variable-interval schedules (a five-component multiple schedule). For each rat, pimozide, a neuroleptic, decreased response rate, and the decrease was associated with (1) a decrease in the estimated asymptotic response rate and (2) an increase in the rate of reinforcement necessary for half-asymptotic responding. That is, pimozide decreased the proportion of responding maintained by a given rate of reinforcement. In contrast, intermediate doses of amphetamine increased response rate and increased the proportion of responding maintained by a given rate of reinforcement. It was proposed that the response rate asymptote indexes <b>motor</b> <b>capacity,</b> and the rate of reinforcement necessary for half-asymptotic responding indexes reinforcement efficacy; accordingly, pimozide decreased <b>motor</b> <b>capacity</b> and reinforcement strength and amphetamine increased reinforcement strength...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{relationship}} between gross <b>motor</b> <b>capacity</b> and daily-life mobility in children with cerebral palsy (CP) and to explore the moderation of this relationship by the severity of CP. Method: Cross-sectional analysis in a cohort study with a clinic-based sample of children with CP (n= 116; 76 males, 40 females; mean age 6 y 3 mo, SD 12 mo, range 4 y 8 mo- 7 y 7 mo) was performed. Gross <b>motor</b> <b>capacity</b> was assessed by the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM- 66). Daily-life mobility was assessed using the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI) : Functional Skills Scale (FSS mobility) and Caregiver Assistance Scale (CAS mobility). Severity of CP was classified by the Gross Motor Function Classification System (48 % level I, 17 % level II, 15 % level III, 8 % level IV, 12 % level V), type of motor impairment (85 % spastic, 12 % dyskinetic, 3 % ataxic), and limb distribution (36 % unilateral, 49 % bilateral spastic). Results: Scores on the GMFM- 66 explained 90 % and 84 % respectively, of the variance of scores on PEDI-FSS mobility and PEDI-CAS mobility. Limb distribution moderated the relationship between scores on the GMFM- 66 and the PEDI-FSS mobility, revealing a weaker relationship in children with unilateral spastic CP (24 % explained variance) than in children with bilateral spastic CP (91 % explained variance). Interpretation: In children aged 4 to 7 years with unilateral spastic CP, dissociation between gross <b>motor</b> <b>capacity</b> and daily-life mobility can be observed, just as in typically developing peers. © The Authors.
