They make the Connex brand of bicycle chains and <b>master</b> <b>links.</b> Their bicycle chains include such high-end features as nickel-plating, hollow pins, stainless steel, titanium rollers, and cutout plates. In 2008, Wippermann published wear test results in which their bicycle chains performed well. Wippermann chains are used by professional cyclists in the Tour de France.|$|R
50|$|The manufacturers' {{instructions}} {{for the removal of}} a <b>master</b> <b>link</b> is to press the face of the two plates together, while pressing both ends inward. When a link is new, or when otherwise difficult to remove, <b>master</b> <b>link</b> pliers can be used (see figure 4).

5000|$|On most upright bicycles, {{the chain}} loops through the right rear {{triangle}} {{made by the}} right chain stay and seat tube. Thus a chain must be separated, (or [...] "broken" [...] ) unless the triangle can be split (usually the seat stay). Chain can either be broken with a chain tool or at a <b>master</b> <b>link.</b> A <b>master</b> <b>link,</b> {{also known as a}} connecting link, allows the chain to be inserted or removed with simpler tools, or even no tools, for cleaning or replacement.|$|E
50|$|Some links have {{side plates}} that are raised on top (figure 3), while some are straight, (figure 2), {{and some have}} more {{prominent}} pin projections than others. Since a chain on a derailleur-fitted bicycle is reversed for part of its excursion through the drive-train, and because some cogsets have close ramp tolerances, such a link might cause a malfunction if the wrong selection were made. Bushingless chains, with smaller projections, are used on bicycles with large cogsets, since their clearances are more critical than those with only seven speeds. In these former cases a <b>master</b> <b>link</b> of comparable quality is needed. As a result, some manufacturers of derailleurs (e.g. SRAM) recommend only their own products, and these days package a <b>master</b> <b>link</b> with each new chain that is purchased. Chains for small cogsets (e.g. seven-speeds) and other than derailleur-fitted bicycles are more tolerant of these <b>master</b> <b>link</b> dimensions.|$|E

50|$|Little {{is known}} about the author, a native of Pisa, other than that he {{appears to have been a}} mid to late 15th-century fencing <b>master</b> <b>linked</b> in some way to the {{tradition}} of Fiore dei Liberi and that he dedicated a fencing book to the Dukes of Urbino, in the last quarter of the 15th century. However, a man of the same name appears as a governor of Reggio under the Estense family in the mid- to late 15th century. The book was dedicated to Duke Guidobaldo da Montefeltro (the same duke who plays a central role in Castiglione's Book of the Courtier) and kept in the library of the Dukes of Urbino.|$|R
50|$|To create {{different}} colours and textures, maki-e artists use {{a variety}} of metal powders including gold, silver, copper, brass, lead, aluminum, platinum, and pewter, as well as their alloys. Bamboo tubes and soft brushes of various sizes are used for laying powders and drawing fine lines. As it requires highly skilled craftsmanship to produce a maki-e painting, young artists usually go through many years of training to develop the skills and to ultimately become maki-e masters. Kōami Dōchō (1410-1478) was the first lacquer <b>master</b> <b>linked</b> to specific works. His maki-e works used designs from various Japanese contemporary painters. Kōami and another maki-e master, Igarashi Shinsai, were originators of the two major schools of lacquer-making in the history of Japan.|$|R
50|$|According to Anthony <b>Masters,</b> the <b>Link</b> was {{allegedly}} resurrected in 1940 by Ian Fleming, then {{working in the}} Department of Naval Intelligence, in order to successfully lure Rudolf Hess (deputy party leader and third in leadership of Germany, after Adolf Hitler and Hermann Göring) to Britain in May 1941.|$|R
50|$|The oldest type of <b>master</b> <b>link,</b> {{available}} for decades, has two pins {{connected to the}} same plate. (Refer to Figure 1). It has been in use mainly in single-speed, hub-geared, or other bicycle drivetrain systems with straight chainlines or widely spaced sprockets. In this assembly, the outside plate with the two pins protruding from it are spaced at the same pitch as the chain, one half-inch, and the free ends of the pins are grooved. The other plate fits over {{the ends of the}} pins and is secured with a spring clip to make the connection, and this type of <b>master</b> <b>link</b> comes closest to being re-usable.|$|E
5000|$|Roller {{chain is}} ordinarily hooked up using a <b>master</b> <b>link</b> (also {{known as a}} {{connecting}} link), which typically has one pin held by a horseshoe clip rather than friction fit, allowing it to be inserted or removed with simple tools. Chain with a removable link or pin {{is also known as}} cottered chain, which allows the length of the chain to be adjusted. Half links (also known as offsets) are available and are used to increase the length of the chain by a single roller. Riveted roller chain has the <b>master</b> <b>link</b> (also known as a connecting link) [...] "riveted" [...] or mashed on the ends. These pins are made to be durable and are not removable.|$|E
50|$|Some newer chain designs, such as Shimano and Campagnolo 10-speed chains, {{require a}} special {{replacement}} pin {{to be used}} when installing or reinstalling a separated chain. An alternative to this process is to install a <b>master</b> <b>link,</b> such as a SRAM Power Link or a Wippermann Connex.|$|E

5000|$|A bicycle {{chain is}} a form of roller chain. Bicycle chains may have a <b>master</b> <b>link,</b> or may require a chain tool for removal and installation. A similar but larger and thus {{stronger}} chain is used on most motorcycles although it is sometimes replaced by either a toothed belt or a shaft drive, which offer lower noise level and fewer maintenance requirements.|$|E
50|$|Flat {{chain is}} a form of chain used chiefly in {{agricultural}} machinery. Early machinery made extensive use of flat chain. It has been gradually replaced in most applications by roller chain, which is quieter, lasts longer, and requires less frequent retensioning.Modern flat chain is made from stamped steel. Individual links can be put together or taken apart using simple tools, unlike roller chain which requires a <b>master</b> <b>link</b> or special splicing equipment.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} measure of roller chain's {{strength}} is tensile strength. Tensile strength represents how much load a chain can withstand under a one-time load before breaking. Just {{as important as}} tensile strength is a chain's fatigue strength. The critical factors in a chain's fatigue strength {{is the quality of}} steel used to manufacture the chain, the heat treatment of the chain components, the quality of the pitch hole fabrication of the linkplates, and the type of shot plus the intensity of shot peen coverage on the linkplates. Other factors can include the thickness of the linkplates and the design (contour) of the linkplates. The rule of thumb for roller chain operating on a continuous drive is for the chain load to not exceed a mere 1/6 or 1/9 of the chain's tensile strength, {{depending on the type of}} <b>master</b> <b>links</b> used (press-fit vs. slip-fit). Roller chains operating on a continuous drive beyond these thresholds can and typically do fail prematurely via linkplate fatigue failure.|$|R

50|$|For {{bicycles}} with derailleur gears, {{a special}} kind of <b>master</b> <b>link</b> has been developed to fit the narrow chains used on closely spaced sprockets. In this case, each plate has one pin protruding from it, and the pin ends are grooved. (Refer to Figures 2 and 3). In addition to pins, each link plate has a tapered slot, one end of which is wide enough to accommodate the end of a pin, while the other presents a tight fit.|$|E
