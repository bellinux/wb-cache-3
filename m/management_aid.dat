By making use of ratio analysis, management can identify early danger signs and determine the presence of weaknesses in their business. There are some other critical factors and aspects that become evident from everyday trading activities that also point to danger signs. Management should be mindful and {{become aware of the}} danger signs at an early stage so that corrective action may be taken during a recessionary period. Numerous <b>management</b> <b>aids</b> in the field of financial discipline are at the disposal of management when applying corrective action. The core principles of effective asset management covering cash flow management, credit control, stock control and asset control should be employed to ensure survival during difficult times. Furthermore it is of critical importance that management makes use of the correct sources of financing and knows where to obtain it. It is also important that management addresses the other functional disciplines within the business. Management should continue the function of marketing and selling its products.

We examined the associations between the perception of seriousness of UI, its severity and other factors. The response rate for the survey overall was 71. 3 % and 1549 / 3037 respondents were women, UI was reported by 579 / 1549 (37. 4 %) of female respondents and severe incontinence defined by use of continence <b>management</b> <b>aids</b> by 146 / 1549 (9. 4 %).

40|$|Abstract Background Recent {{studies of}} {{transcription}} activator-like (TAL) effector domains fused to nucleases (TALENs) demonstrate enormous potential for genome editing. Effective design of TALENs requires {{a combination of}} selecting appropriate genetic features, finding pairs of binding sites based on a consensus sequence, and, in some cases, identifying endogenous restriction sites for downstream molecular genetic applications. Results We present the web-based program Mojo Hand for designing TAL and TALEN constructs for genome editing applications ([URL]). We describe the algorithm and its implementation. The features of Mojo Hand include (1) automatic download of genomic data from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, (2) analysis of any DNA sequence to reveal pairs of binding sites based on a user-defined template, (3) selection of restriction-enzyme recognition sites in the spacer between the TAL monomer binding sites including options for the selection of restriction enzyme suppliers, and (4) output files designed for subsequent TALEN construction using the Golden Gate assembly method. Conclusions Mojo Hand enables the rapid identification of TAL binding sites for use in TALEN design. The assembly of TALEN constructs, is also simplified by using the TAL-site prediction program {{in conjunction with a}} spreadsheet <b>management</b> <b>aid</b> of reagent concentrations and TALEN formulation.

The reliance on such electronic infrastructures {{should not be}} underestimated by managers or computer scientists.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to improve the quantitative support to project planning and control principally through the use of more accurate forecasting for which new techniques were developed. This study arose from the observation that in most cases construction project forecasts were based on a methodology (c. 1980) which relied on the DHSS cumulative cubic cost model and network based risk analysis (PERT). The former of these, in particular, imposes severe limitations which this study overcomes. Three areas of study were identified, namely growth curve forecasting, risk analysis and the interface of these quantitative techniques with project management. These fields have been used as a basis for the research programme. In order to give a sound basis for the research, industrial support was sought. This resulted in both the acquisition of cost profiles for a large number of projects and the opportunity to validate practical implementation. The outcome of {{this research}} project was deemed successful both in theory and practice. The new forecasting theory was shown to give major reductions in projection errors.

Environmental conventions such as the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change or the Convention on Biological Diversity call for new ways of managing natural land, water and biological resources. In this context, traditional multispectral optical and radar remote sensing methodologies are widely used as a monitoring tool and <b>management</b> <b>aid.</b> Nevertheless, important surface parameters demanded by environmental scientists as input to physically based ecosystem models cannot be derived from such existing satellite data.

40|$|Background: Life {{expectancy}} of older drug users has increased, primarily thanks to opioid agonist treatment (OAT). Nursing homes {{are often not}} adapted to accommodate patients with substance use disorders. Although care and adherence to polypharmacy in older opioid users need considerable resources e. g., daily visits to an outpatient clinic, outpatient treatment and surveillance are provided as long as possible. We developed a novel medication supply model with an electronic dispenser of pre-packed medications located at patient home, after allowing for law requirements concerning the dispensing of opioids, and present preliminary results from three illustrative outpatients. Methods: The community pharmacy provided unit-of-dose pouches with all solid oral medications directly to patient home. Opioids for substitution were obtained at the addiction clinic in at least weekly intervals, otherwise in the pouches. The pouches were loaded into a lockable, remote-controlled medication <b>management</b> <b>aid</b> that was programmed according to the patient’s medication schedule.
