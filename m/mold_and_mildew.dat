The Red Cross dispersed over 25,000 clean-up kits (containing bleach, cleaning materials, goggles, and other equipment) funded by the State Department of Health that owners used to clean their flood-damaged property and possessions. Since many possessions and appliances were contaminated by flood water, sewage, <b>mold,</b> <b>and</b> <b>mildew,</b> residents were told by city officials to paint the word [...] "Flood" [...] or make some other mark to prevent looting. Over 60,000 tons of flood debris was hauled to local landfills.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, Champagne {{was making}} its mark and {{embedding}} itself into popular culture. The early 20th century brought its share of challenges. Some of the seeds of these challenges were planted during the century before when Champagne's growing popularity encouraged Champagne houses to look outside the Champagne region for a cheaper supply of grapes. The French railway system made it easy for truckloads of grapes from the Loire Valley or Languedoc to be transported to Champagne at prices nearly half of what the houses were paying Champenois vine growers for their grapes. Newspapers published rumors of some houses buying rhubarb from England to make wine from. With hardly any laws in place to protect the vine grower or the consumer, Champagne houses had most of the power in the region to profit off of these [...] Champagnes. To compound the misery for Champenois vine growers, the last few vintages of the 19th century were difficult with frost and rains severely reducing the crop yields. The phylloxera epidemic that ravaged vineyards across France was finally making its way to Champagne. The harvests between 1902 and 1909 were further troubled by <b>mold</b> <b>and</b> <b>mildew.</b> The 1910 vintages was particularly troublesome with hailstorms and flooding. Nearly 96% of the crop was lost.|$|E

Interestingly, antifungal activity against powdery mildew was observed in the water-soluble portion, suggesting that cyclic lipopeptides have no responsibility to suppress powdery mildew.

Included in the group "fungi " are yeasts, <b>molds</b> <b>and</b> <b>mildews,</b> as well as large mushrooms, puffballs and bracket fungi that grow on dead trees. Fungi need external organic food sources and water to be able to grow. Molds Molds can grow on cloth, carpets, leather, wood, sheet rock, insulation (and on human foods) when moist conditions exist (Gravesen et al., 1999). Because molds grow in moist or wet indoor environments, it is possible for people to become exposed to <b>molds</b> <b>and</b> their products, either by direct contact on surfaces, or through the air, if mold spores, fragments, or mold products are aerosolized. Many molds reproduce by making spores, which, if they land on a moist food source, can germinate and begin producing a branching network of cells called hyphae. Molds have varying requirements for moisture, food, temperature and other environmental conditions for growth. Indoor spaces that are wet, and have organic materials that mol...|$|R

40|$|Conidial fungi or <b>molds</b> <b>and</b> <b>mildews</b> {{are widely}} used in modern {{biotechnology}} as producers of antibiotics and other secondary metabolites, industrially important enzymes, chemicals and food.

Functional genomics and proteomics widely exploit the genomic information to study the cell-wide impact of altered genes on the phenotype of an organism and its function. This allows for global analysis of the information flow from DNA to RNA to protein, but it is usually not sufficient for the description of the global phenotype of an organism. More recently, Phenotype MicroArray (PM) technology has been introduced as a tool to characterize the metabolism of a (wild) fungal strain or a mutant. In this article, we review the background of PM applications for fungi and the methodic requirements to obtain reliable results. We also report examples of the versatility of this tool...|$|R
40|$|Grain <b>mold</b> <b>and</b> downy <b>mildew</b> are {{important}} biotic constraints to grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) production worldwide and are best managed through host plant resistance. A sorghum mini-core collection composed of 242 germplasm accessions developed from a core collection of 2, 246 landrace accessions from 58 countries was evaluated to identify sources of grain <b>mold</b> <b>and</b> downy <b>mildew</b> resistance. Of the 242 accessions, 140 that flowered {{during the rainy}} season (the other 102 accessions were photoperiod sensitive) were screened for grain mold resistance in a grain mold nursery under field epiphytotic conditions during 2007 and 2008. All 242 accessions were screened for downy mildew in the greenhouse using a sandwich inoculation technique. Fifty accessions were resistant to grain mold (≤ 10 % mean severity). These resistant accessions represented four basic and six intermediate races of sorghum that originated from 21 countries and exhibited considerable diversity for agronomic and morphological traits. Downy mildew resistance (mean incidence ≤ 10 %) was observed only in six (IS 28747, IS 31714, IS 23992, IS 27697, IS 28449, and IS 30400) of the 242 accessions.

Environment-friendly methods of controlling tomato diseases include agroecological practices, organic fungicides, and biological control.

We investigated the ability of a novel elicitor extracted from the brown sea algae (Sargassum fusiforme) to elicit induced resistance in tomato.
