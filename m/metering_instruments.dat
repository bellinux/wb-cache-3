40|$|Preventing {{black powder}} {{contamination}} from damaging a gas pipeline’s metering system requires regular dismantling and cleaning of its <b>metering</b> <b>instruments,</b> manifolds, impulse lines, and associated facilities. Determining which cleaning method to apply, however, requires gathering comprehensive {{information about the}} nature of the black powder problem. Only then can the operator determine which technique will provide the most efficient and cost-effective method of removing black powder from gas installations. Background Solid contaminants—known as black powder—found in natural gas transmission and distribution systems are a cause of increasing concern in the global natural gas industry. Chemical or biological reactions with steel found in natural gas pipelines, gas wells, and associated facilities can create black powder. Operators can detect black powder in both dry and wet gas pipelines and in conjunction with other contaminants such as oil, grease, liquid hydrocarbons, and sand. 1 Black powder influences the flow performance of gas pipelines and can also impair the function of valves and measurement systems, requiring the development of specifi...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{the concern}} about power quality is {{continuously}} increasing, due to industry automation and use of nonlinear devices introduced in the power system.

40|$|In this paper, an {{averaging}} {{pitot tube}} (APT) with flow conditioning wing (FCW) geometry {{is used as a}} practical sensing device to measure and characterize the flow of single-phase gaseous carbon dioxide (CO 2). This technique demonstrates a simple, cost-effective, and potentially accurate option toward the measurement, accurate accounting, and characterization of CO 2 in carbon capture and storage pipelines. The metrological performance of the flow sensor is verified using air medium before being applied for gaseous CO 2. With a Coriolis mass flowmeter acting as a secondary calibration reference to further validate the performance of the APT-FCW flow sensor, both <b>metering</b> <b>instruments</b> were evaluated against a weighing scale apparatus. From the experimental and calibration data with air, the APT-FCWs average K-factor and linearity error are found to be 0. 5091 and 0. 725 %, respectively. With operating conditions remaining unaltered in this particular flow measurement application and a target metering error within ± 1 %, the errors achieved for the Coriolis meter and the APT-FCW are better than ± 0. 6 % and ± 1. 2 %, respectively. Total uncertainty estimations under the stipulated environmental and working conditions are within ± 1 % and ± 1. 5 % for the Coriolis meter and APT-FCW, respectively.

40|$|To {{combat the}} growing {{emissions}} of CO 2 from industrial processes, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and Carbon Capture and Utilization technologies (CCU) {{have been accepted}} worldwide to address these pressing concerns. So as to efficiently manage material and financial losses across the entire stream, accurate accounting and monitoring through fiscal metering of CO 2 in CCS transportation pipelines are core and required features for the CCS technologies. Moreover, these technical requirements {{are part of the}} legal compliance schemes and guidelines from various regulatory bodies. The CO 2 transportation pipelines will likely have multiple inputs from different capture plants, each with varying composition of CO 2 and thus introducing impurities into the CO 2 stream. The presence of other ordinary or hydrocarbon gases in the CO 2 gas stream could affect the functionality of <b>metering</b> <b>instruments</b> by introducing additional errors, particularly in the case of volumetric flowmeters. In this study, volumetric and direct mass measurement methods for the flow measurement of CO 2 mixtures using two totally different metering principles are experimentally evaluated. An Averaging Pitot Tube with Flow Conditioning Wing (APT-FCW) and Coriolis mass flowmeters (CMF) are used to assess the flow metering of CO 2 in a binary gaseous mixture. Different gases (nitrogen, air, oxygen, argon and propane) are diluted as contaminants into the pure CO 2 gas flow for various mass fractions to produce an adulterated mixture of the CO 2 gas. Comparative analysis of the measurement results under these flow conditions relative to that of pure CO 2 gas show that the measurement error of the APT-FCW sensor increases with the mass fraction of the diluent component, and gases with density closer to that of CO 2 have a much lesser effect on the performance of the APT-FCW flow sensor for smaller mass fractions. The CMF proved to be very reliable in the gas combination processes and as a reference meter for the APT-FCW sensor. Further analytical observations are discussed in detail...|$|E
