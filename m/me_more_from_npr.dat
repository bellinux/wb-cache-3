The station added a 24-hour classical music station on its HD radio subcarrier.|$|R

6000|$|I {{advanced}} towards her, hardly {{conscious of}} what I was doing.

5000|$|When {{characters}} Jenny and Jesse {{were killed}} off {{instead of being}} recast by new actors once the actors decided to leave their roles, it was so that no other actors could portray them. To Nixon, these actors were the characters. Morgan saw Jesses death as bittersweet. She pointed to Williams leaving the series {{as one of her}} toughest moments as part of the cast, but how it also provided interesting story. [...] "It really affected <b>me</b> <b>more</b> <b>from</b> a personal standpoint than from an actors standpoint," [...] she said. [...] "From a personal standpoint, Darnell and I were like hooked at the neck or the back or something; wed gotten to be such good friends. But from an actors point of view, it didnt really bother me as much because I knew that it would just open up so many more avenues for Angie to take." ...|$|R
60|$|The pomp of this pew and the aristocratical air of {{the family}} struck My {{imagination}} wonderfully, and I fell desperately {{in love with a}} little daughter of the squire's about twelve years of age.
