40|$|Data on {{physical}} capital are an indispensable part {{of economic growth}} and efficiency studies. In the case of China, economy-wide <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> series are usually derived by aggregating gross fixed capital formation (net of depreciation) over time, and sectoral/ownership-specific series by correcting the limited official <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> data available. These procedures, to varying degrees, ignore that (i) gross fixed capital formation does not equal investment, (ii) investment does not equal the value of <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> newly created through investment, (iii) depreciation is an accounting measure that bears no necessary relation {{to changes in the}} production capacity of <b>fixed</b> <b>assets,</b> (iv) official <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> data, where available, incorporate significant revaluations in the 1990 s, and (v) "net fixed assets" do not measure the contribution of <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> to production. This paper derives economy-wide <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> values for 1953 - 2003, correcting for these shortcomings. It uses both the traditional, cumulative approach and a new, so far unexplored method of combining economy-wide depreciation values and an economy-wide depreciation rate to directly yield economy-wide <b>fixed</b> <b>assets.</b> The derived <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> time series are evaluated in a comparison with each other as well as with series in the literature, leading to the recommendation of a specific choice of <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> time series.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{incentives}} for <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> revaluation. The motives that are investigated include firm size, <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> intensity, firm foreign operations and acquisitions, firm indebtedness and earnings management inclination. Design/methodology - The study utilises logistic and linear regressions to test the hypothetical relations set up in the study. The categorisation of sample companies into those that perform asset revaluations and those that do not is based on the examination of firms' annual reports. Findings - The findings of the study provide evidence that firm size is positively related to <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> revaluation. Firms with foreign operations, with low <b>fixed</b> <b>assets,</b> and with high debt capital needs are more likely to perform <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> revaluations. This is also the case for firms that carry out acquisitions. The study also shows that <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> revaluation is negatively related to earnings management. Research limitations/implications - Firms that revalue their <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> should examine the signals that are likely to be conveyed to investors about their managerial ability and financial prospects. Firms would tend to revalue their <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> when it is likely to result in maximum favourable financial consequences. Future research should investigate the possible opportunism in firms' behaviour, as well as the stock market reaction to <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> revaluations. Originality/value - The paper is useful for investors and financial analysts, as it sheds light on the motives for <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> revaluations. The reporting of asset values based on fair values would assist them in making unbiased predictions about firms' future performance. The paper gives insight about the financial attributes of firms that perform <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> revaluations. For example, firms with capital needs would be inclined to undertake a <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> revaluation in order to reinforce their financial position.
