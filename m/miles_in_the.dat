Routes22 and 9 join together, closely parallel to the Adirondack Northway (I-87), the only other route in the state to directly connect New York City with Canada. The three routes, spread over many <b>miles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern part of the state, run through a narrow corridor for two miles (3km) until Routes9 and 22 veer east again toward Keeseville.|$|E
5|$|Eytel {{returned}} to Germany to study art for 18 months (1897–1898) at the Royal Art School Stuttgart and then re-immigrated to the United States. Wanting to be a cowboy, {{he worked as}} a cowhand in the San Joaquin Valley and in 1903 he would settle in Palm Springs. Living in small cabins he built himself, Palm Springs would remain his home. Eytel often walked on his travels, covering 400 <b>miles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Colorado Desert on foot. On one of his travels he was nearly lynched as a horse thief and in 1918, during a trip to northern Arizona, he was threatened with lynching as a German spy.|$|E

5|$|In 1975, a {{study found}} no fish {{species on the}} creek. However, brook trout have been {{observed}} at seven locations on Solomon Creek. Brook trout are especially common on the tributary Sugar Notch Run. Trout reproduce everywhere in the tributary Pine Creek and reproduce in the main stem as far downstream as southern Wilkes-Barre. Above of the South Wilkes-Barre borehole, {{a number of other}} fish species have been observed. These include eastern blacknose dace, bluegill, creek chub, fallfish, minnows, northern hog sucker, and white sucker. However, there are no species of fish downstream of the borehole. Out of 46 sites on the creek, 30 had sufficient macroinvertebrate concentrations to support trout. 2.6 stream <b>miles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> watershed are home to brook trout fisheries. This area is in Hanover Township, Laurel Run, and Bear Creek Township.|$|E
5|$|The NavyJohns Hopkins rivalry was an American intercollegiate {{football}} {{rivalry between}} the Navy Midshipmen football {{team of the}} United States Naval Academy and the Johns Hopkins Blue Jays football team of Johns Hopkins University. The two institutions, located within the span of a few <b>miles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state of Maryland, first met for a football game in 1882. Following the initial contest, both teams played each other annually for eight years, before it was called off for unknown reasons. The teams competed again in 1911 and 1912, again disbanding the contest until a final match took place in 1919.|$|E
5|$|Persia at {{the time}} was divided into British and Russian spheres of influence, with a neutral zone in between. Germany {{exercised}} influence over the central parts of the country through their consulate in Isfahan. The local populace and the clergy, opposed to Russian and British semi-colonial designs on Persia, offered support to the mission. Niedermayer and von Hentig's groups reconnoitred Isfahan until the end of June. The Viceroy of India, Lord Hardinge, was already receiving reports of pro-German sympathies among Persian and Afghan tribes. Details of the progress of the expedition were being keenly sought by British intelligence. By now, British and Russian columns close to the Afghan border, including the Seistan Force, were hunting for the expedition. If the expedition was to reach Afghanistan, it would have to outwit and outrun its pursuers over thousands of <b>miles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> extreme heat and natural hazards of the Persian desert, while evading brigands and ambushes.|$|E
