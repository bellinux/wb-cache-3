25|$|Miter gauge: The table has {{one or two}} slots (grooves) {{running from}} front to back, also {{parallel}} to the cutting plane of the blade. These miter slots (or miter grooves) are used to position and guide either a <b>miter</b> <b>gauge</b> (also known as a crosscut fence) or crosscut sled. The <b>miter</b> <b>gauge</b> is usually set to be at 90 degrees to {{the plane of the}} blade's cut, to cause the cut made in the workpiece to be made at a right angle. The <b>miter</b> <b>gauge</b> can also be adjusted to cause the cut to be made at a precisely controlled angle (a so-called miter cut).|$|E
50|$|A <b>miter</b> <b>gauge</b> is {{a device}} used for holding {{workpieces}} at a set angle while being cut on table saws, band saws or sanded on stationary disk sanders. The <b>miter</b> <b>gauge</b> slides in a slot on the worktable (known as a miter slot) {{on the machine}} being used. Typically, the <b>Miter</b> <b>Gauge</b> and the workpiece are held together by hand and moved across the worktable making the cut (or sanded edge). Although, there are more sophisticated miter gauges that {{have the ability to}} clamp the workpiece or have adjustable stops for repetitive machining of workpieces.|$|E
