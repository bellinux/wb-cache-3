40|$|Embedded {{software}} is a sub-system {{that needs to}} be integrated with the electrical and mechanical subsystems for a functional <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> to be developed and marketed. In {{order to be able to}} develop a <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> system through integrating its sub-systems, the complete system requirements should be known at the start of the project and managed throughout development.

40|$|Abstract Software {{traceability}} {{is central}} to <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> software develop-ment and essential for regulatory approval. In order {{to comply with the}} regulatory requirements of the <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> industry it is essential to have clear linkages and traceability from requirements- including risks- through the different stages of the software development and maintenance lifecycles. The regulatory bodies request that <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> software development organizations clearly demon-strate how they follow a software development lifecycle without mandating a par-ticular lifecycle. However, due to the traceability requirements of the industry most <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> companies adopt the V-model. Within this chapter we will discuss the importance of traceability to <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> software development, the current state of practice within the industry in relation to traceability and how we feel that traceability could be improved within the industry. The chapter also de-scribes {{the development and implementation of}} a <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> traceability soft-ware process assessment method (Med-Trace) in two <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> software de-velopment organizations.

5|$|Bacteria often {{attach to}} {{surfaces}} and form dense aggregations called biofilms, and larger formations known as microbial mats. These biofilms and mats {{can range from}} a few micrometres in thickness to up to half a metre in depth, and may contain multiple species of bacteria, protists and archaea. Bacteria living in biofilms display a complex arrangement of cells and extracellular components, forming secondary structures, such as microcolonies, through which there are networks of channels to enable better diffusion of nutrients. In natural environments, such as soil or the surfaces of plants, the majority of bacteria are bound to surfaces in biofilms. Biofilms are also important in medicine, as these structures are often present during chronic bacterial infections or in infections of implanted <b>medical</b> <b>devices,</b> and bacteria protected within biofilms are much harder to kill than individual isolated bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Damage to a German steel {{facility}} {{occurred during}} a DST transition in 1993, when a computer timing system {{linked to a}} radio time synchronization signal allowed molten steel to cool for one hour less than the required duration, resulting in spattering of molten steel when it was poured. <b>Medical</b> <b>devices</b> may generate adverse events that could harm patients, without being obvious to clinicians responsible for care. These problems are compounded when the DST rules themselves change; software developers must test and perhaps modify many programs, and users must install updates and restart applications. Consumers must update devices such as programmable thermostats with the correct DST rules or manually adjust the devices' clocks. A common strategy to resolve these problems in computer systems is to express time using the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) rather than the local time zone. For example, Unix-based computer systems use the UTC-based Unix time internally.|$|E
40|$|A recent {{revision}} to the European <b>Medical</b> <b>Device</b> Directive (MDD) 2007 / 47 /EC made fourteen {{amendments to}} the original directive (93 / 42 /EEC). A number of these changes directly affect the development of software for use in healthcare. The most significant change in relation to <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> software development is that standalone software {{is now seen as}} an active <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> and should be developed following state of the art <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> software development processes.

40|$|Directive 2007 / 47 /EC of the European Parliament {{amending}} <b>Medical</b> <b>Device</b> Directive (MDD) provides <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> manufacturers with a compliance framework. However, {{the effects}} of the amendments to the MDD on competition in the U. S. <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> software industry are unknown. This study examined the impact of this directive on the competitiveness of U. S. <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> software companies, the safety and efficacy of <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> software, employee training, and recruitment. The conceptual framework for this study included 3 dimensions of <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> regulations: safety, performance, and reliability. The overall research design was a concurrent mixed method study using both quantitative and qualitative techniques. The qualitative techniques involved case studies of 5 purposively selected companies. Data collection involved both surveys and interviews. The sample consisted of 56 employees within <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> firms with markets around the European regions. Qualitative data analysis consisted of descriptive thematic analysis along the study questions and hypotheses and summative evaluation. Quantitative data analysis included descriptive statistics and correlation to test the 4 hypotheses. The results suggested that the MDD has realigned <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> software manufacturing practices, and US <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> companies have gained global competitiveness in improving product safety and increasing sales revenue. Key recommendations to <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> manufacturers include adopting MDD 93 / 42 /EEC, using model-based approaches, and being comprehensive in model use.

40|$|The <b>Medical</b> <b>Device</b> {{industry}} is currently {{one of the}} fastest growing industries in the world and a guarantee of the integrity of <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> software has become increasingly important. Failure of the software can have potentially catastrophic effects, leading to injury of patients or even death. Consequently there is a tremendous onus on <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> manufacturers to demonstrate that sufficient attention is devoted to the area of software risk management throughout the software lifecycle. Failure to do so can lead to a lack of approval from the various regulatory bodies with a consequent surrender of the right to market the device in a particular country. Several different standards, guidance papers and industry guides exist which make it difficult to guarantee conformance in all cases. This diverse set of requirements can make software risk management difficult and this thesis examines the possibility of a unified approach whilst investigating the relevance of the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI®) SPI model to the regulatory requirements. It is demonstrated that existing SPI models are not comprehensive enough to satisfy <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> safety requirements and an alternative is proposed. The research presented in this thesis develops a software Risk Management Capability Model (RMCM) for the <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> sector, which meets <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> regulatory requirements and the CMMI® Software Process Improvement (SPI) risk management practices. The RMCM has been evaluated within a <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> company producing <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> software. During the creation of the model a mapping has been performed between <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> regulations and the CMMI® guidelines for software risk management. The research identifies the potential strengths and weaknesses of the CMMI® risk management process area in the specific context of <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> software.
