The distribution and binding properties of specific MSH binding sites were determined by autoradiography and image analysis after incubation of frozen tumor tissue sections with a biologically active, radiolabeled analogue of alpha-MSH, [125 I]iodo-Nle 4, D-Phe 7 -alpha-MSH ([125 I]NDP-MSH). In melanoma specimens from 11 patients, 3 showed high levels of specific binding, 5 showed low levels, and in 3 patients specific binding of [125 I]NDP-MSH was not detectable. Specific MSH binding sites were present in melanoma cells, but not in adjacent connective or inflammatory tissues. <b>Melanotropins,</b> including alpha-MSH, NDP-MSH, and ACTH, inhibited [125 I]NDP-MSH binding in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas unrelated peptides (somatostatin and substance P) did not. The apparent affinity of alpha-MSH for this binding site was in the nanomolar range (EC 50 = 2 X 10 (- 9) M for inhibition of [125 I]NDP-MSH binding in situ), similar to that recently described for the murine melanoma receptor.

40|$|<b>Melanotropin</b> is a peptide having several functions, {{including}} the stimulation of melanogenesis and the modulation of proliferation of melanocytes and melanoma cells. It acts through binding to high-affinity receptors of the melanocortin- 1 subtype, exclusively expressed in {{cells of the}} melanocytic lineage. Elevated levels of immunoreactive alpha-melanotropin were previously reported in melanoma cell lines, tumours and plasma from patients with melanoma. Here, we show that this high ectopic production of <b>melanotropin</b> is restricted to melanoma and non-pituitary tumours with the same neuroectodermic origin. The occurrence of a melanotropin-specific autocrine loop was further investigated in human melanoma cells. Immunoreactive alpha-melanotropin was spontaneously released from a melanoma cell line (HBL) expressing <b>melanotropin</b> receptors on the cell surface. This release was significantly increased {{in the presence of}} melanotropin-related peptides such as corticotropin-(4 - 10) -peptide and beta-melanotropin, competing for binding to the <b>melanotropin</b> receptor and was directly correlated to the displacement potential of these peptides. Both spontaneous and induced releases of immunoreactive alpha-melanotropin could be blocked at low temperatures, suggesting the involvement of intracellular protein movement in the release mechanism. The release of immunoreactive alpha-melanotropin was not significant in melanoma cells expressing very low levels of <b>melanotropin</b> receptors (IGR 3) or in non-melanoma cells (SCC 1). However, upon expression of the melanocortin- 1 receptor cDNA into IGR 3 cells, spontaneous and competition-induced releases of immunoreactive alpha-melanotropin were both increased and also blocked at low temperatures. This observation further underlines a role for the <b>melanotropin</b> receptor in the release of immunoreactive alpha-melanotropin. These experiments indicate that an autocrine loop between the melanocortin- 1 receptor and immunoreactive alpha-melanotropin may be functional in human melanoma cells.

To elucidate the mechanism of this upregulation, the expression of genes encoding corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and its receptor, CRHR, as well as POMC and the MSH receptor (MC 1 -R), was evaluated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using cultured human melanoma cells, nevus cells, and normal melanocytes. Our results show that all melanocytic cells express CRH, CRH-R, POMC, and MC 1 -R, with highest intensities in melanoma cells. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry shows that CRH as well as POMC is strongly expressed in advanced melanomas, such as vertically growing lesions of acral lentiginous, nodular and metastatic melanomas, in contrast to negative expression in nevus cells.

The <b>melanotropin</b> analogue Ac- α-MSH₄₋₁₂-NH₂ contains all of the structural requirements necessary for obtaining full biological potency on the lizard (Anolis carolinensis) melanophore and S- 91 mouse melanoma. On the frog (Rana pipiens) melanophore, the <b>melanotropin</b> analogue Ac-[Nle⁴]-α-MSH₄₋₁₃-NH₂ possesses full melanotropic potency relative to the native hormone. The smallest <b>melanotropin</b> analogue capable of eliciting any biological response was Ac-α-MSH₆₋₉-NH₂ (Ac-His-Phe-Arg-Trp-NH₂) on all biological systems studied. The low biological activity found in previous studies for smaller <b>melanotropin</b> analogues may have been due to a trace contamination of a potent <b>melanotropin.</b> The importance of each of the thirteen amino acid residues of α-melanotropin in contributing to the melanotropic actions in a number of biological systems is discussed. We were unable to confirm the reported presence of a second independent active sequence in α-melanotropin. The structural requirements for prolongation of biological activity (following removal of exogenous hormone from the assay medium) and enzyme stability have been studied. Analysis suggests species-dependent differences in the structural relationships of the amino acid residues in the 4, 7 and 11 positions for prolonged melanotropic response. Analogues prepared with D-phenylalanine in place of its L-enantiomer in the seventh positions of α-melanotropin analogues generally results in an increased resistance to enzymatic degradation towards rat brain homogenate, rat serum, and to the purified enzymes, trypsin and chymotrypsin.

Binding between the beads and mouse and {{human melanoma cells}} was examined by scanning electron microscopy and by light microscopy. Each mouse and human melanoma cell (of all cell lines) evinced binding to the beads. Binding of the <b>melanotropin</b> conjugates was not restricted to any one phase of the cell cycle.

Negative controls included cell types of nonmelanocyte origin (e. g., mammary cancer cells) and beads that lacked the melanotropic ligand or had other attached ligands.

During these experiments, certain membrane receptor-hormone associated phenomena, such as capping (aggregation) of the receptor-ligand complex, also were observed.

40|$|AbstractUltraviolet B {{radiation}} (UVB) elicits {{an increase}} in melanin production in mammalian skin. The mechanisms regulating this process are not understood, although it is well documented that there is {{an increase in}} the number of melanin-producing melanocytes. The <b>melanotropins</b> (MSH) are a family of peptides that increase the melanin content of melanocytes through an interaction with high affinity receptors. We have obtained evidence that the effects of UVB on melanogenesis may be mediated through an increase in MSH receptor activity on melanocytes. First, exposure of Cloudman S 91 mouse melanoma cells to UVB resulted in increased binding of 125 I-MSH to cells within 24 h. In five separate experiments, UVB-irradiated cultures displayed 2 – 10 -fold increases in MSH binding capacity over that of unirradiated control cultures (optimum doses 10 – 20 mJ/cm 2). Second, UVB and MSH potentiated one another in promoting cutaneous melanogenesis in both mice and guinea pigs. In the areas of guinea pig skin that received both UVB and MSH, there was a fivefold increase in active melanocytes/mm 2 over the sum of active melanocytes/mm 2 in areas receiving either MSH or UVB separately. Our results suggest that UVB light causes an increase in MSH receptor activity on cutaneous melanocytes, thus increasing cellular responsiveness to MSH. Implicit in this mechanism is a transduction of radiant energy into chemical energy during the process of UVB-induced melanogenesis...|$|R

The murine S 91 melanoma cell line, CCL 53. 1, responded to α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) in a dose- and a time-dependent manner, by increased tyrosinase activity. The minimal effective dose of α-MSH required to stimulate tyrosinase activity was 10 ⁻⁹M. By prolonging the exposure period of the cells to the hormone from 24 to 48, to 72 hours, the magnitude of tyrosinase stimulation was increased, but the minimal effective dose was not changed. α-MSH action involved elevation of intracellular cyclic AMP levels, and did not require the influx of extracellular calcium. Three <b>melanotropin</b> analogues, [Nle⁴, D-Phe⁷]-α-MSH, Ac-[Nle⁴, D-Phe⁷]-α-MSH₄₋₁₁-NH₂, and Ac-[Nle⁴, D-Phe⁷]- α-MSH₄₋₁₀-NH₂, {{have been shown to be}} more active than (alpha) -MSH in dispersing melanosomes within amphibian and reptilian integumental melanophores.

The unique properties of these <b>melanotropin</b> analogues led to investigate their effects on the phenotypic expression and on the proliferation of S 91 melanoma cells. The relative potency and the possible prolonged actions of the three [Nle⁴, D-Phe⁷] -substituted analogues were investigated and compared to those of α-MSH. The <b>melanotropin</b> analogues proved to be 100 - 1000 fold more active than α-MSH in stimulating tyrosinase activity. These analogues elicited significant tyrosinase activation following brief contact times with the cells, and maintained their stimulatory effects for days after removal from the culture flasks, and after the α-MSH effect had totally dissipated. Contrary to previous reports that melanotropins inhibit the proliferation of melanoma cells, α-MSH and [Nle⁴, D-Phe⁷] -α-MSH stimulated, rather than inhibited, the proliferation of CCL cells under culture conditions that allowed optimal phenotypic expression. Also, the effects of the steroids, β-estradiol, progesterone, and dexamethasone, on CCL cells were studied. Dexamethasone had the most remarkable effects, which involved stimulation of tyrosinase activity and inhibition of proliferation in monolayer culture and in soft agar.

Thus, if it were possible to attach a radioisotope (e. g., ¹²⁵I) to α-MSH, or a suitable analogue, without interfering with the receptor affinity of the hormone, then a radioreceptor assay could be developed which would allow hormone-receptor interaction to be studied in detail.

The studies described herein provide information concerning: chloramine T induced iodination, lactoperoxidase catelyzed iodination, and iodogen induced iodination of α-MSH and certain structural analogues. Radio-labeled derivatives of various melanotropins were prepared using a variety of iodination techniques. Under conditions commonly used for the iodination of other peptides a substantial loss of biological activity of the native hormone (α-MSH) was observed. This loss of hormonal activity was primarily a consequence of oxidation of methinonine and occurred regardless of the oxidant used (chloramine T, lactoperoxidase-hydrogen perioxide, or iodogen).

In the absence of exogenous α-MSH, ASIP inhibited basal levels of tyrosinase activity and cell proliferation and reduced the level of immunoreactive tyrosinase-related protein- 1 (TRP- 1) without significantly altering the level of immunoreactive tyrosinase. In addition, ASIP blocked the stimulatory effects of forskolin or dibutyryl cAMP, agents that act downstream from the MC 1 R, on tyrosinase activity and cell proliferation.

In order to better understand and associate in vitro tumor cell invasion through basement membranes with in vivo tumor metastasis in syngeneic animal models, and the subsequent modulation of these processes, the following studies have been undertaken. Malignant murine melanoma cell lines designated B 16 F 1 and B 16 F 10, syngeneic to the C 57 BL 6 mouse, a melanotic variant of the Cloudman S- 91 melanoma cell line (denoted Mel- 11 a) with the syngeneic host being the DBA/ 2 J mouse, and a malignant human melanoma line referenced as A 375 P (parental) and A 375 M (metastatic) were used for this dissertation project. Tumor cells were labeled with either ¹⁴C-thymidine or ¹²⁵I-deoxyuridine using previously established protocols.

The superpotent analogue of α-MSH ([Nle⁴, D-Phe⁷] -MSH) showed a proliferative and survival enhancing effect on tumor metastasis in vivo with no effect on in vitro tumor cell invasion, with similar effects demonstrated by α-MSH. The effects of these <b>melanotropins</b> on spontaneous metastasis formation appears to be negligible.

The neural crest-derived melanocytes were unable to invade the basement membranes (BM); although co-culturing neural crest cells with B 16 F 10 melanoma cells produced an effect such that the neural crest cells did significantly invade the BMs. These studies demonstrate the ability of the MICS in vitro invasion assay to discriminate between tumor cells with differing metastatic propensities and could possibly be used in future studies to predict the effectiveness of biological response modifying agents in vivo...|$|R

It is suggested that these structural similarities may explain observations concerning common functional characteristics such as serotonin modulation, immunological activity with the adjuvant muramyl dipeptide, immunological cross-reactivity, and the possible MSH-ACTH-like activity of a pepsin-derived peptide of interferon...|$|E

40|$|A new melanocyte-stimulating peptide {{has been}} {{isolated}} from acid extracts of frozen human pituitary glands by salt/ethanol fractionation, Sephadex G- 75 gel filtration and DEAE- and cM-cellulose ion-exchange chromatography. The peptide is glycosylated, has an N-terminal tryptophan residue and an apparent mol. wt. of 16000 as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. Its amino acid analysis closely resembles residues Trp- 105 to Gln- 29 predicted {{for the common}} precursor protein of bovine corticotropin and beta-lipotropin by Nakanishi, Inoue, Kita, Nakamura, Chang, Cohen & Numa [(1979) Nature (London) 278, 423 - 427]. This fragment {{is expected to have}} <b>melanotropin</b> activity due to the tetrapeptide -His-Phe-Arg-Trp- (residues - 51 to - 48) of the predicted sequence of the common precursor. It was found to have a molar potency of 1 X 10 (- 5) relative to alpha-melanotropin in the frog skin bioassay. These characteristics are consistent with the isolated <b>melanotropin</b> peptide being a non-corticotropin, non-lipotropin peptide of the human common precursor protein of corticotropin and lipotropin. The peptide neither potentiates the adrenal weight-maintenance activity of corticotropin-(1 - 24) -tetracosapeptide when administered to hypophysectomized rats, nor stimulates release of non-esterified fatty acids from isolated rat epididymal cells. A second N-terminal-tryptophan glycopeptide was also isolated, which had an amino-acid composition similar to that predicted for the bovine common precursor protein, residues Trp- 105 to Gly- 35...|$|E
40|$|Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is {{synthesized}} in the {{pituitary gland}} {{as part of}} a larger precursor molecule. This precursor is characterized by the fact that it contains within its structure multiple chemical messengers with quite different biological activities. Among them are included the <b>melanotropins</b> (MSH), the beta-lipotropin ((beta) -LPH) and the endorphins. To account for the major biological activities of its components, the name pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) has been proposed for this common precursor. Characterization of this molecule in pituitary tissues including both the anterior and intermediate lobes as well as the mouse anterior pituitary tumour cell line AtT- 20 /D 16 v, established its apparent molecular weight (Mr) to be around 30 000 Daltons with the presence of carbohydrate side chains attached to a peptide backbone. This latter aspect is considered partly responsible for the heterogeneity observed in both the molecular weight and the charge of the molecule. Nucleotide sequencing of the cDNA coding for POMC has predicted the whole primary structure. ACTH and (beta) -LPH together account for only half the size of the precursor, the other half being located on the amino-terminal side. This cryptic segment as ACTH and (beta) -LPH contains an MSH-like sequence called (gamma) -MSH. Pulse and pulse-chase experiments indicated that this cryptic segment of the POMC has an apparent molecular weight of 16 000 to 19 000 Daltons and that it is an important maturation product. In order to completely characterize this cryptic segment we dissected porcine pituitary glands in both the anterior and neurointermediate lobes. Our objective was to determine the molecular form of the amino terminal segment of the porcine POMC (pNT) in the anterior lobe using a chemical approach. We extracted the peptides from the anterior lobes and chromatographed them on various systems including molecular sieving, ion-exchange and high performance liquid chromatography. Complete primary structure of the pNT revealed that the major form is a glycopeptide of 80 amino acid residues with at least two glycosylation sites. Two other peptides of 107 and 61 amino acid residues were isolated. We proposed that they are members of the genealogic tree of the pNT, the 107 residue being the whole cryptic segment preceding ACTH and the amidated 61 residue being a maturation product of the major secretory form. We also isolated a peptide which links the 80 residue glycopeptide to the ACTH in the POMC; it will be called the joining peptide (pJP) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to determine whether <b>melanotropin</b> receptors are characteristic (constant) membrane markers of melanocytes, and, more importantly human melanoma cells. Methodologies were developed to visualize these receptors by light, scanning electron (SEM) and fluorescence microscopy. Multiple copies (up to a hundred) of [Nle⁴, D-Phe⁷] α-MSH, a superpotent analog of α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH), were conjugated to macromolecular carriers, either latex beads (microspheres and macrospheres) or another inert substrate, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Multiple copies (up to a hundred) of a fluorophore were also attached to the PVA. Incubation {{in the presence of}} the macromolecular conjugates of the analog resulted in binding of human normal epidermal melanocytes and melanoma cells (but not other cells) to both small and large beads and to the fluorescent conjugate. Binding of the microspheres or the fluorescent conjugate to the cells exhibited a unique cluster pattern (capping) suggesting a receptor internalization related phenomenon. Only a single aggregate of beads was present on each cell suggesting a focal site of endocytosis. Most importantly, every cell of every melanoma cell line possessed receptors as visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Since the cells were not synchronized, binding apparently took place during all phases of the cell cycle. Therefore, receptor expression is not cell-cycle dependent. Specificity of binding of the macromolecular conjugates was demonstrated by several studies: (1) binding of melanocytes/melanoma cells to the conjugates was specific since it could be blocked by prior incubation of the cells {{in the presence of the}} unconjugated hormone analog, (2) the macromolecular substrates (latex beads, PVA) lacking bound ligand did not bind to the melanoma cells or melanocytes, (3) another peptide ligand (e. g., substance-P) attached to the substrates failed to bind to the cells, and (4) cells of nonmelanocyte origin (e. g., mammary cancer cells, lung cancer cells, fibroblasts) did not bind to the macromolecular conjugates. Thus, cell specific <b>melanotropin</b> receptors appear to be characteristic cell surface markers of epidermal melanocytes and melanoma cells. Fluorescent <b>melanotropin</b> conjugates should be useful in determining whether all human melanoma (primary and metastatic) tumors possess such receptors. These receptors may provide targets for melanotropic peptides for the identification, localization, and chemotherapy of melanoma...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMelanocytes and {{melanoma}} {{cells are}} known to possess receptors for melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH). A cDNA clone, designated IID, has been isolated from human melanoma cells and encodes a MSH receptor. The cloned cDNA encodes a 317 amino acid protein with transmembrane topography characteristics of a G-protein-coupled receptor, {{but it does not}} show striking similarity to already published sequences of other G-protein-coupled receptors. When IID cDNA is expressed in COS- 7 cells, it binds an 125 I-labelled MSH analogue (NDP-MSH) in a specific manner. The bound ligand could be displaced by melanotropic peptides, α-MSH, β-MSH, γ-MSH and ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone), but not by the non-melanotropic peptide, β-endorphine.

40|$|Binding of beta-melanotropin (betal-melanocyte {{stimulating}} hormone) to mouse melanoma cells {{occurs in}} a region on the cell surface overlying the Golgi complex. This association was demonstrated by labeling cells with fluorescein isothiocyanate hormone and by locating the Golgi complex with a histochemical test for thiamine pyrophosphatase activity. The biologically active fluorescent hormone appears {{on the surface and}} later in vesicles in the malanized cells, as judged by fluorescence microscopy. It is conceivable that internalization of the hormone is instrumental in the process of hormonally induced melanization. Because initial and late events of hormonally induced pigmentation are related to the Golgi complex, it is likely that instructions that follow the attachment of <b>melanotropin</b> to receptors are carried out in a compartmentalized manner...|$|E

Evaluation of these multimers on a cell model engineered to overexpress melanocortin 4 receptors (MC 4 R) showed up to a 350 -fold increase in binding compared to the monomer, resulting in a trivalent construct with nanomolar affinity starting from a micromolar affinity ligand.

In the present study, we have isolated a peptide of the pancreatic polypeptide family from the skin of the South American arboreal frog Phyllomedusa bicolor.
