5|$|Russian customs {{officials}} twice {{refused to let}} the target enter the country because of <b>missing</b> <b>or</b> <b>incomplete</b> paperwork. Over the span of a few days, the target traveled over the Atlantic Ocean five times. On its arrival in Russia in June 2009, the berkelium was transferred to Research Institute of Atomic Reactors (RIAR) in Dimitrovgrad, Ulyanovsk Oblast, where it was deposited as a 300-nanometer-thin layer on a titanium film. In July 2009, it was then transported to Dubna, where it was installed in the particle accelerator at JINR. The calcium-48 beam was generated by chemically extracting the small quantities of calcium-48 present in naturally occurring calcium, enriching it 500 times.

50|$|D&Cs are {{commonly}} performed for {{the diagnosis of}} gynecological conditions leading to 'abnormal uterine bleeding'; to resolve abnormal uterine bleeding (too much, too often or too heavy a menstrual flow); to remove the excess uterine lining in women who have conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (which cause a prolonged buildup of tissue with no natural period to remove it); to remove tissue in the uterus that may be causing abnormal vaginal bleeding, including postpartum retained placenta; to remove retained tissue (also known as retained POC or retained products of conception) {{in the case of}} a <b>missed</b> <b>or</b> <b>incomplete</b> miscarriage (in which some of the tissue remains in the uterus and the cervix stays open. This may increase a woman's risk of infection and continued bleeding); and as a method of abortion.

Only fetal deaths resulting in overnight hospitalization of the mother were reported. Seventy-nine percent of fetal deaths over 28 completed weeks since the last menstrual period (LMP) were reported versus only 10 percent between 20 and 28 completed weeks since the LMP. Ninety-three percent of fetuses over 400 grams were reported.

50|$|The {{advantage}} of using subjective logic abduction compared to probabilistic abduction is that {{uncertainty about the}} probability values of the input arguments can be explicitly expressed and taken into account during the analysis.

30|$|Manual vacuum {{aspiration}} under {{local anaesthesia}} (MVA-LA) in an outpatient setting {{is an alternative}} to the standard surgical aspiration under general anaesthesia for miscarriage. We evaluate the feasibility, safety and clinical outcomes of MVA-LA in the management of miscarriage at less than 12  weeks of gestation in an outpatient setting. This prospective cohort study was conducted at the Birmingham Women’s Hospital. One hundred and thirty-one women with ultrasound scan confirmed <b>incomplete</b> <b>or</b> <b>missed</b> miscarriage underwent MVA-LA between November 2010 and January 2013. A computer database was used to record relevant information. The mean gestation age was 8.3  weeks (± 1.8). Successful evacuation was achieved in 100  % of cases. One hundred and fourteen (87  %) patients underwent the procedure with direct intracervical LA block and the remaining cases did not have LA. There were no reported complications in 96  % of procedures. Cervical injury and vasovagal symptoms noted in 3.8  % of cases. In all cases, vaginal bleeding was minimal or mild. The post-operative pain was controlled successfully with a combination of paracetamol and diclofenac in 82  % of patients. The MVA method was associated with high levels (93  %) of patient satisfaction and acceptability. MVA-LA in an outpatient setting is a safe and acceptable therapeutic option for women diagnosed with early <b>missed</b> <b>or</b> <b>incomplete</b> miscarriage.|$|R
