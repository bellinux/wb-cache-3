500|$|The album {{continued}} to receive praise {{after the release}} of Dopesmoker. Eduardo Rivadavia of online music database AllMusic gave the album four and a half stars out of five stating [...] "Dopesmoker is [...] an instant doom metal classic—some <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>say</b> a masterpiece". The British music magazine Mojo gave the album a rating of five out of five stars proclaiming that Dopesmoker is [...] "A benchmark by which all that dares call itself stoner rock must surely be judged." [...] Exclaim! praised Dopesmokers production value and noted that the album was [...] "ultimately better version of 1999's stoner opus Jerusalem." [...] Stylus Magazine's Stewart Voegtlin defined Dopesmoker as [...] "a 60-minute song about the spliff, a monstrous rock ode to stinky buds". Voegtlin pointed out that London Records' refusal to [...] "share Sleep's affection or vision, [...] disbanding in disgust. Matt Pike went on to form High on Fire; Al Cisneros and Chris Hakius contemplate the universe's navel with Om." [...] A New York Times critic wrote: [...] "What seems disorienting and monochromatic at first grows richer and more rewarding upon repeated exposure. It’s like a Mark Rothko painting hitting you over the head with a bag of hammers." ...|$|E

He collaborated with others on all of his books (some of which were written with Pat Hackett.) He adopted the young painter Jean-Michel Basquiat, and the band The Velvet Underground, presenting them {{to the public as}} his latest interest, and collaborating with them. One <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>say</b> that he produced people (as in the Warholian [...] "Superstar" [...] and the Warholian portrait). He endorsed products, appeared in commercials, and made frequent celebrity guest appearances on television shows and in films (he appeared in everything from Love Boat to Saturday Night Live and the Richard Pryor movie Dynamite Chicken).|$|E
2500|$|The Tosefta {{reported}} that Jewish judicial proceedings adopted the oath that Abraham imposed in [...] And Rav Judah said that Rav {{said that the}} judge adjures the witness with the oath stated in [...] "And I will make you swear by the Lord, the God of heaven." [...] Ravina explained that this accorded with the view of Rabbi Haninah bar Idi, who said that Jewish judicial proceedings require swearing by the Name of God. Rav Ashi replied that one <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>say</b> that it accorded with {{the view of the}} Rabbis, who said that a witness can be adjured with a Substitute for the Name of God. They concluded that the witness needs to hold something sacred in his hand, as Abraham's servant did when in [...] he put his hand under Abraham's thigh and held Abraham's circumcision. Rava said that a judge who adjures by [...] "the Lord God of heaven" [...] without having the witness hold a sacred object errs and has to repeat the swearing correctly. Rav Papa said that a judge who adjures with tefillin errs and has to repeat the swearing. The law follows Rava, but not Rav Papa, as tefillin are considered sacred.|$|E

60|$|I {{stood looking}} at the Coronation Procession&mdash;I mean the one in Beaconsfield; not the rather elephantine {{imitation}} of it which, I believe, had some success in London&mdash;and I was seriously impressed. Most of my life is passed in discovering with a deathly surprise that I was quite right. Never before have I realised how right I was in maintaining that the small area expresses the real patriotism: the smaller the field the taller the tower. There were things in our local procession that did not (one <b>might</b> <b>even</b> reverently <b>say,</b> could not) occur in the London procession. One {{of the most prominent}} citizens in our procession (for instance) had his face blacked. Another rode on a pony which wore pink and blue trousers. I was not present at the Metropolitan affair, and therefore my assertion is subject to such correction as the eyewitness may always offer to the absentee. But I believe with some firmness that no such features occurred in the London pageant.|$|R

[...] "I remember Vincent Lunardi, sir. I was present in Heriot's Gardens when he made an ascension there in October '85. He came down at Cupar. The Society of Gentlemen Golfers at Cupar presented him with an address; and at Edinburgh he was admitted Knight Companion of the Beggar's Benison, a social company, or (as I may say) crew, since defunct. A thin-faced man, sir. He wore a peculiar bonnet, if I may use the expression, very much cocked up behind. The shape became fashionable. He once pawned his watch with me, sir; that being my profession. I regret to say he redeemed it subsequently: otherwise I might have the pleasure of showing it to you. O yes, the theory of ballooning {{has long been a}} passion with me. But in deference to Mrs. Sheepshanks I have abstained from the actual practice--until to-day.

40|$|It {{is usually}} the case when {{describing}} the conference interpreting profession or the training for an interpreting degree, the discussion is overshadowed by commonly known aspects of translation practice.   The fact that non-linguistic traits or the interpreter’s aptitude primarily account for the overall performance of interpreting is still worth investigating in interpretation studies. Persona and cognitive abilities of the interpreter have occupied a considerable position {{in the literature of}} interpretation studies which often attempted to explore interpreting as a terra incognita. Some <b>might</b> <b>even</b> go to <b>say</b> that interpreters are born with an inherent aptitude to interpret. This study attempts to draw some distinctions between interpreting and translation. To achieve this end, the study focuses on non-linguistic traits of interpreting such as aptitude and cognitive abilities of the interpreters that cater for the specificities of the interpreting profession. The personal and cognitive skills arguably enable interpreters to perform the highly cognitively and communicatively demanding task of interpreting.   Keywords : interpreting, aptitude, cognitive abilities, interpreting skills</p...|$|R
5000|$|The taurobolium in the 2nd and 3rd centuries {{was usually}} {{performed}} {{as a measure}} for the welfare (salus) of the Emperor, Empire, or community; H. Oppermann denies early reports that its date was frequently 24 March, the Dies Sanguinis ("Day of Blood") of the annual festival of the Great Mother Cybele and Attis; Oppermann reports {{that there were no}} taurobolia in late March. In the late 3rd and the 4th centuries its usual motive was the purification or regeneration of an individual, who was spoken of as renatus in aeternum, [...] "reborn for eternity", in consequence of the ceremony. While its efficacy was not eternal, its effect was considered to endure for twenty years, as if the magic coating of the blood wore off after that time, the initiate having taken his vows for [...] "the circle of 20 years" [...] (bis deni orbis). It was also performed as the fulfilment of a vow (votum), or by command of the goddess herself, and the privilege was not limited by sex or class. In its 4th-century revival in high pagan circles, Rutter has observed, [...] "We <b>might</b> <b>even</b> justifiably <b>say</b> that the taurobolium, rather than a rite effectual in itself was a symbol of paganism. It was a rite apparently forbidden by the Christian emperors and thus became a hallmark of the pagan nobility in their final struggle against Christianity and the Christian emperors." [...] The place of its performance at Rome was near the site of St Peter's, in the excavations of which several altars and inscriptions commemorative of taurobolia were discovered.|$|R
60|$|A {{few months}} before the lamented death of my husband--I <b>might</b> <b>say</b> <b>even</b> as the shadow of death was over him--he planned three series of short stories for publication, and the present volume is one of them. To his {{original}} list of stories in this book, I have added an hitherto unpublished episode from Dracula. It was originally excised owing to the length of the book, and may prove of interest to the many readers of what is considered my husband's most remarkable work. The other stories have already been published in English and American periodicals. Had my husband lived longer, he might have seen fit to revise this work, which is mainly from the earlier years of his strenuous life. But, as fate has entrusted to me the issuing of it, I consider it fitting and proper to let it go forth practically as it was left by him.|$|R

2500|$|Karl Menger found mathematicians {{to be too}} parsimonious {{with regard}} to variables, so he {{formulated}} his Law Against Miserliness, which took one of two forms: [...] "Entities must {{not be reduced to}} the point of inadequacy" [...] and [...] "It is vain to do with fewer what requires more." [...] A less serious but (some <b>might</b> <b>say)</b> <b>even</b> more extremist anti-razor is 'Pataphysics, the [...] "science of imaginary solutions" [...] developed by Alfred Jarry (1873–1907).

[...] Variations on this theme were subsequently explored by the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges in his story/mock-essay [...] "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius". There is also Crabtree's Bludgeon, which cynically states that [...] "o set of mutually inconsistent observations can exist for which some human intellect cannot conceive a coherent explanation, however complicated." ...|$|R
50|$|According to Aristotle, {{the virtue}} {{with regards to}} anger would not be led by the {{emotions}} (pathoi), but by reason (logos).

The person with this virtue will however tend {{to err on the side}} of forgiveness rather than anger, and the person with a deficiency in this virtue, despite seeming foolish and servile, will be closer to the virtue than someone who gets angry too easily.|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{biological}} {{brains are}} by nature open-ended opportunistic controllers. Such controllers compute, {{pretty much on}} a moment-to-moment basis, what problem-solving resources are readily available and recruit them into temporary problem-solving wholes. Neural plasticity, exaggerated in our own species, {{makes it possible for}} such resources to become factored deep into both our cognitive and physical problem-solving routines. One way to think about this is to depict the biological brain as a master of what I shall dub ‘ecological control’. Ecological control is the kind of top-level control that does not micro-manage every detail, but rather encourages substantial devolvement of power and responsibility. This kind of control allows much of our skill at walking to reside in the linkages and elastic properties of muscles and tendons. And it allows (I claim) much of our prowess at thought and reason to depend upon the robust and reliable operation, often (but not always) in dense brain-involving loops, of a variety of non-biological problem-solving resources spread throughout our social and technological surround. Are the complex distributed systems that result in some sense ‘out of control’, beyond the reach of useful (you <b>might</b> <b>even,</b> though problematically, <b>say,</b> ‘personal’) governance? I shall argue that they are not, although understanding them requires us to re-think some key ideas about control {{and the nature of the}} self. To (try to) make this case, I shall first examine some strategies for efficient, external opportunity exploiting control in simple systems. I shall then argue that many of the same lessons apply to the case of higher-level human problem-solving...|$|R
60|$|There {{are only}} two forms of {{government}} the monarchy or personal government, and the republic or impersonal government. England is not a government; England is an anarchy, {{because there are so}} many kings. But there is one real advantage (among many real disadvantages) in the method of abstract democracy, and that is this: that under impersonal government politics are so much more personal. In France and America, where the State is an abstraction, political argument is quite full of human details&mdash;some <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>say</b> of inhuman details. But in England, precisely because we are ruled by personages, these personages do not permit personalities. In England names are honoured, and therefore names are suppressed. But in the republics, in France especially, a man can put his enemies' names into his article and his own name at the end of it.|$|E

This was a different person. With the swiftness of inspiration itself, he recognised something of the change which had taken place. Saton had fought his battle twice over. He might esteem himself a winner. He <b>might</b> <b>even</b> <b>say</b> that he had proved it. Yet there was another side.

2500|$|Ancient sources {{describe}} Callimachus's poem Ibis [...] {{which does}} not survive [...] as a polemic {{and some of them}} identified Apollonius as the target. These references conjure up images of a sensational literary feud between the two figures. Such a feud is consistent with what we know of Callimachus's taste for scholarly controversy and it <b>might</b> <b>even</b> explain why Apollonius departed for Rhodes. Thus there arises [...] "a romantic vision of scholarly warfare in which Apollonius was finally driven out of Alexandria by a triumphant Callimachus". However, both of the Lives of Apollonius stress the friendship between the poets, the second Life <b>even</b> <b>saying</b> they were buried together; moreover Callimachus's poem Ibis is known to have been deliberately obscure and some modern scholars believe the target was never meant to be identified.

40|$|It {{might be}} said that western Europe has {{experienced}} two demographic transitions. The first-t'ne extent, date, duration, and some <b>might</b> <b>say</b> <b>even</b> the existence of which are conjectural-was a transition from early and universal marriage to the west European form of nuptiality. " Ansley Coale, who made this point in 1973 (Coale 1973), calls this first transition the Malthusian transition since Malthus - {{at a time of}} already late marriage - advocated a still higher age at marriage as the {{solution to the problem of}} unfavourable high fertility. The second transition then refers to the decline in marital fertility and the introduction of conscious family limitation; hence it might be called the Neomalthusian transition. The second demographic transition is obvious in all European countries. It began in France around 1800; for the bulk of the countries marital fertility started to decline on a significant scale between 1890 and 1910. These marital fertility transitions occurred at a time when national population statistics had already started to register the structure of the population and the incidence of marriages, births and deaths. For most countries, at least crude fertility indicators can be calculated to show the extent and timing of this secuiar fertility decline [...] . ...|$|R
