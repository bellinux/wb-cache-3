To do this accurately, in intervals where multiple crossovers may occur, a mathematical model of chiasma interference must be assumed when mapping in organisms displaying such interference. In Saccharomyces cerevisae the model most frequently used is that of R. W. Barratt. An alternative to this model is presented. This new model is implemented using a microcomputer and standard numerical methods.

40|$|Background The {{assessment}} of the joint space thickness is an important clinical parameter for diagnosing osteoarthritis. The accuracy of joint space thickness evaluation from radiographs is limited due to anatomical complexity of the wrist. We propose using <b>distance</b> <b>maps</b> estimated from 3 -dimensional and 4 -dimensional images reflecting joint space thickness distribution over the relevant part of the articular surface. Methods In this paper we investigate the difference between joint space thicknesses acquired from dynamic <b>distance</b> <b>maps</b> to static <b>distance</b> <b>maps.</b> A dynamic <b>distance</b> <b>map</b> gives for every point on a subchondral bone surface the shortest distance to the opposing subchondral bone surface during wrist motion. We hypothesize that the joint space thickness calculated from dynamic <b>distance</b> <b>maps</b> provide a better reflection of the functional joint space thickness. The diagnostic potential of the dynamic joint space thickness measurement is illustrated by comparing data from <b>distance</b> <b>maps</b> of osteoarthritic wrists with normal wrists. Findings In 10 healthy wrists which are examined, dynamic joint space thickness is smaller than static acquired joint space thickness suggesting that dynamic <b>distance</b> <b>maps</b> provide a better estimate of the measured joint space thickness than joint space thickness based on a static joint space thickness. In 3 examined osteoarthritic wrists the joint space thickness is smaller than in healthy individuals. Moreover, the difference between dynamic and static joint space thickness is smaller in pathological joint parts. Interpretation The method {{presented in this paper}} demonstrates the feasibility of in vivo dynamic <b>distance</b> <b>maps</b> to detect joint space thickness in the radiocarpal joint of healthy individual...|$|R

40|$|Malaria parasites {{are sexually}} {{reproducing}} protozoa, although {{the extent of}} effective meiotic recombination in natural populations has been debated. If meiotic recombination occurs frequently, compared with point mutation and mitotic rearrangement, linkage disequilibrium between polymorphic sites is expected to decline with increasing distance along a chromosome. The rate of this decline should be proportional to the effective meiotic recombination rate in the population. Multiple polymorphic sites covering a 5 -kb region of chromosome 9 (the msp 1 gene) have been typed in 547 isolates from six populations in Africa to test for such a decline and estimate its rate in populations of Plasmodium falciparum. The magnitude of two-site linkage disequilibrium declines markedly with increasing molecular <b>map</b> <b>distance</b> between the sites, reaching nonsignificant levels within a map range of 0. 3 - 1. 0 kb {{in five of the}} populations and over a larger <b>map</b> <b>distance</b> in the population with lowest malaria endemicity. The rate of decline in linkage disequilibrium over molecular <b>map</b> <b>distance</b> is at least as rapid as that observed in most chromosomal regions of other sexually reproducing eukaryotes, such as humans and Drosophila. These results are consistent with the effective recombination rate expected in natural populations of P. falciparum, predicted {{on the basis of the}} underlying molecular rate of meiotic crossover and the coefficient of inbreeding caused by self-fertilization events. This is conclusive evidence to reject any hypothesis of clonality or low rate of meiotic recombination in P. falciparum populations. Moreover, the data have major implications for the design and interpretation of population genetic studies of selection on P. falciparum gene...|$|E
