5|$|Hughes {{insisted that}} there was nothing more they could do to deter Rhodesia directly; they had already {{threatened}} to expel Rhodesia's representative from the British Embassy in Washington, with no effect. The only open course therefore had to be to take a firmer line with Portugal. Two days later, on 7 September, Wilson discussed the <b>matter</b> <b>with</b> Hughes and Stewart, and agreed with their conclusions, telling them to proceed.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the magistrates}} {{delegated}} Henry Law {{to go to}} London to discuss the <b>matter</b> <b>with</b> Lord Sidmouth, the Home Secretary. On the way, Law stopped at the barracks of the Royston troop of volunteer yeomanry cavalry and requested they go to Ely. Law was unable to convince Sidmouth {{of the seriousness of}} the situation, and Sidmouth asked Reverend Sir Henry Bate Dudley to return with Law and report on the matter.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} {{way to gain}} information about brain anatomy is by visual inspection, but many more sophisticated techniques have been developed. Brain tissue in its natural state is too soft to work with, {{but it can be}} hardened by immersion in alcohol or other fixatives, and then sliced apart for examination of the interior. Visually, the interior of the brain consists of areas of so-called grey <b>matter,</b> <b>with</b> a dark color, separated by areas of white <b>matter,</b> <b>with</b> a lighter color. Further information can be gained by staining slices of brain tissue with a variety of chemicals that bring out areas where specific types of molecules are present in high concentrations. It is also possible to examine the microstructure of brain tissue using a microscope, and to trace the pattern of connections from one brain area to another.|$|E

5|$|Alan Brooke, {{commander}} of the British II Corps sought to put the matter of cooperation right with King Leopold. The King discussed the <b>matter</b> <b>with</b> Brooke, who felt a compromise could be reached. Van Overstraeten, the King's military aide, stepped in {{and said that the}} 10th Belgian Infantry Division could not be moved. Instead, the British should move further south and remain completely clear of Brussels. Brooke told the King that the 10th Belgian Division was {{on the wrong side of}} the Gamelin line and was exposed. Leopold deferred to his advisor and chief of staff. Brooke found Overstaeten to be ignorant of the situation and the dispositions of the BEF. Given that the left flank of the BEF rested on its Belgian ally, the British were now unsure about Belgian military capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Desert Strike was a {{commercial}} success: {{it was a}} chart-topping best seller {{and at the time}} Electronics Arts' highest selling game. The game also received a favourable critical response, with several magazines awarding scores of over 90%. Reviewers praised the game's enjoyability, mix of action and strategy, graphics and sound. There was some controversy regarding the game's subject <b>matter,</b> <b>with</b> commentators criticising it as in poor taste due the proximity of its release to the recently ended Gulf War.|$|E
5|$|Having taken {{office in}} 1805, Shaw {{determined}} to re-establish the tradition whereby the Lord Mayor took precedence in public processions within the City of London over all except the reigning monarch, {{and took the}} opportunity of the funeral of Lord Nelson in 1806 to do so. According to one account, Shaw discussed the <b>matter</b> <b>with</b> the Prime Minister, Lord Liverpool, who was aware that the Prince Regent would be attending the funeral, but did not seem willing to take action. Shaw then offered to visit the King himself at Windsor Castle to resolve the matter, and Liverpool {{said that he would}} see what could be done. By the following day, the Royal Warrant of Precedence had been granted, and Shaw duly led the procession.|$|E

5|$|HeliumII is a superfluid, {{a quantum}} {{mechanical}} state (see: macroscopic quantum phenomena) of <b>matter</b> <b>with</b> strange properties. For example, when it flows through capillaries {{as thin as}} 10−7 to 10−8m it has no measurable viscosity. However, when measurements were done between two moving discs, a viscosity {{comparable to that of}} gaseous helium was observed. Current theory explains this using the two-fluid model for helium II. In this model, liquid helium below the lambda point is viewed as containing a proportion of helium atoms in a ground state, which are superfluid and flow with exactly zero viscosity, and a proportion of helium atoms in an excited state, which behave more like an ordinary fluid.|$|E
5|$|His {{first major}} task was the {{creation}} of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). The government established a joint Army–Navy board to provide recommendations on the <b>matter,</b> <b>with</b> Blamey and Lieutenant Colonel Richard Williams as the Army representatives. Blamey supported the creation of a separate air force, albeit one still subordinate to the Army and Navy. He refused to yield, however, on his opposition to the Navy's demand that Lieutenant Colonel Stanley Goble become its first chief.|$|E
5|$|In 1826, {{shortly after}} the death of his father, Meyerbeer married his cousin, Minna Mosson (1804–1886). The {{marriage}} which may have been 'dynastic' in its origins proved to be stable and devoted; the couple were to have five children, of whom the three youngest (all daughters) survived to adulthood. In the same year, following the death of Carl Maria von Weber, Weber's widow asked Meyerbeer to complete her husband's unfinished comic opera Die drei Pintos. This was to cause him much trouble over future years, as he found the material insufficient to work on. Eventually in 1852 he settled the <b>matter</b> <b>with</b> Weber's heirs by handing them Weber's drafts and a cash compensation. (The opera was later completed by Gustav Mahler).|$|E

5|$|In 2004, the ACLU {{sued the}} federal {{government}} in American Civil Liberties Union v. Ashcroft on behalf of Nicholas Merrill, owner of an Internet service provider. Under the provisions of the Patriot Act, the government had issued national security letters to Merrill to compel him to provide private Internet access information from some of his customers. In addition, the government placed a gag order on Merrill, forbidding him from discussing the <b>matter</b> <b>with</b> anyone.|$|E
5|$|In September 1943, the Los Alamos Laboratory's director, Robert Oppenheimer, {{arranged}} for von Neumann to visit Los Alamos and investigate implosion {{with a fresh}} set of eyes. After reviewing Neddermeyer's studies, and discussing the <b>matter</b> <b>with</b> Edward Teller, von Neumann suggested the use of high explosive in shaped charges to implode a sphere, which he showed could not only result in a faster assembly of fissile material than was possible with the gun method, but which could greatly {{reduce the amount of}} material required. The prospect of more efficient nuclear weapons impressed Oppenheimer, Teller and Hans Bethe, but they decided that an expert on explosives was required. Kistiakowsky's name was immediately suggested, and he was brought into the project as a consultant in October 1943.|$|E
5|$|In early 1944, Smyth {{raised the}} {{possibility}} of producing an unclassified report for the general public on the achievements of the Manhattan Project. The director of the Metallurgical Laboratory, Arthur Compton, supported the idea. He arranged a meeting with James B. Conant, the President of Harvard University and one of the senior administrators of the Manhattan Project, who had similar thoughts. Conant took up the <b>matter</b> <b>with</b> the Manhattan Project's director, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr.. In April, Smyth received a formal letter from Groves asking him to write such a report. Both the report and the choice of Smyth as its author were approved by the Manhattan Project’s governing body, the Military Policy Committee, in May 1944.|$|E

5|$|Northcott {{spent much}} of his time from 1943 on in a long battle with the {{government}} over the number of men and women allocated to the Army. He attempted to do so without Blamey being dragged into a political fight but this proved to be impossible. In September 1944, the government reduced the Army's monthly intake of women from 925 to 500, while it only received 420 out of 4,020 men allocated to the three services. Such a meagre allocation was below what the Army needed to maintain its strength, and formations had to be disbanded. Blamey took up the <b>matter</b> <b>with</b> Prime Minister John Curtin, and managed to get a more satisfactory monthly allocation of 1,500 men per month out of 3,000 allocated to the three services.|$|E
5|$|On {{the largest}} scale, the Universe is {{continually}} expanding, {{resulting in an}} average increase in the separation between individual galaxies (see Hubble's law). Associations of galaxies can overcome this expansion on a local scale through their mutual gravitational attraction. These associations formed early in the Universe, as clumps of dark matter pulled their respective galaxies together. Nearby groups later merged to form larger-scale clusters. This on-going merger process (as well as an influx of infalling gas) heats the inter-galactic gas within a cluster to very high temperatures, reaching 30–100 megakelvins. About 70–80% of the mass in a cluster {{is in the form}} of dark <b>matter,</b> <b>with</b> 10–30% consisting of this heated gas and the remaining few percent of the matter in the form of galaxies.|$|E
5|$|The Clause {{has led to}} {{very little}} litigation, {{in part because of}} its overlap (as a {{practical}} <b>matter)</b> <b>with</b> the venue provision of Article Three and Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

5|$|The Harlem Globetrotters invited Russell to {{join their}} {{exhibition}} basketball squad. Russell, who was sensitive to any racial prejudice, was enraged {{by the fact that}} owner Abe Saperstein would only discuss the <b>matter</b> <b>with</b> Woolpert. While Saperstein spoke to Woolpert in a meeting, Globetrotters assistant coach Harry Hanna tried to entertain Russell with jokes. The USF center was livid after this snub and declined the offer: he reasoned that if Saperstein was too smart to speak with him, then he was too smart to play for Saperstein. Instead, Russell made himself eligible for the 1956 NBA draft.|$|E
5|$|The {{claims have}} been criticized for {{ignoring}} that the second law only applies to isolated systems. Organisms are open systems as they constantly exchange energy and <b>matter</b> <b>with</b> their environment: for example animals eat food and excrete waste, and radiate and absorb heat. It is argued that the Sun-Earth-space system does not violate the second law because the enormous increase in entropy due to the Sun and Earth radiating into space dwarfs the local decrease in entropy caused by the existence and evolution of self-organizing life.|$|E
5|$|The {{next step}} was to broach the <b>matter</b> <b>with</b> the Canadians.

On 19 February 1942, MacDonald, Thomson and Wallace Akers, the director of Tube Alloys, met with C. J. Mackenzie, the president of the NRC, who enthusiastically supported the proposal. The following day he took them to see C. D. Howe, the Minister of Munitions and Supply.|$|E
