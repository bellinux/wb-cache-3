In spite of the advances with dedicated low-dose CT protocols, a recent study evaluated renal colic CT studies conducted in 93 institutions in the USA from May 2011 to January 2013 [9] and demonstrated that reduced-dose renal CT protocols are used infrequently. The overall <b>mean</b> <b>effective</b> institutional <b>dose</b> was 11.2  mSv.

40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{quantify}} and compare effective doses from conventional angiography and multislice computed tomography (MSCT) coronary angiography using a 16 -slice scanner. BackgroundMultislice computed tomography is now a viable modality for cardiac imaging. However, for any diagnostic use of ionizing radiation, the risk to the patient must be considered and justified. MethodsMultislice computed tomography angiography and conventional angiography were used to assess 180 patients with suspected coronary artery disease. Estimates of effective dose were derived from exposure data recorded for each patient examination. For each modality, a comparable calculation technique was used, based on Monte Carlo modeling of the standard Cristy phantom.

40|$|Introduction The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{estimate}} organ and <b>effective</b> <b>doses</b> in patients undergoing some common X-ray examinations in Sabzevar, Iran. The <b>effective</b> <b>dose</b> is one of the best parameters for describing the amount of radiation dose received by a patient undergoing any diagnostic X-ray examination. The public dose from X-ray examinations depends on various factors, and its contribution to the overall public dose from medical applications widely varies in different societies; however, in Iran, limited data is available on this subject.

40|$|Abstract: Spinal {{injection}} procedures can {{be performed}} blindly or, more accurately, with fluoroscopic or computed tomography (CT) guidance. Radiographic guidance for selective nerve root blocks and epidural injections allows an accurate needle placement, reduces the procedure time and is more secure for the patient, especially in patients with marked degenerative changes and scoliosis, resulting in a narrowing of the interlaminar space. Limiting factors remain the availability of scanners and the radiation dose. Interventional CT scan protocols in axial CT-acquisition mode for epidural and periradicular injections help to limit the radiation dose without a significant decrease of image quality. The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyze the effective radiation dosage patients are exposed during CT-guided epidural lumbar and periradicular injections. A total amount of n= 1870 datasets from 18 months were analyzed after multiplying the dose length product with conversion factor k for each lumbar segment.

The {{analyses}} of radiation hygienic monitoring conducted in Tula region territories {{affected by the}} Chernobyl NPP accident regarding cesium- 137 and strontium- 90 in the local foodstuffs and the {{analyses of}} populational annual <b>effective</b> <b>dose.</b> The materials and methods. The survey was conducted in Tula Region since 1997 to 2015. Over that period, more than fifty thousand samples of the main foodstuffs from the post-Chernobyl contaminated area were analyzed. Simultaneously with that, the external gamma - radiation dose rate was measured in the fixed control points. The dynamics of cesium - 137 and strontium- 90 content in foodstuffs were assessed along with the maximum values of the <b>mean</b> annual <b>effective</b> <b>doses</b> to the population and {{the contribution of the}} collective dose from medical exposures into the structure of the annual <b>effective</b> collective <b>dose</b> to the population. The results. The amount of cesium- 137 and strontium - 90 in the local foodstuffs was identified. The external gamma- radiation dose rate values were found to be stable and not exceeding the natural fluctuations range typical for the middle latitudes of Russia’s European territory. The maximum <b>mean</b> annual <b>effective</b> <b>dose</b> to the population reflects the stable radiation situation and does not exceed the permissible value of 1 mSv.

30|$|In {{relation}} to the detection of urinary tract calculi, we subjectively found {{a large proportion of}} the LD-CT ASiR- 70 images difficult to interpret. This was reflected in the difficulty in tracing the ureters on the LD-CT images. In spite of this, however, sensitivity and specificity for detecting calculi greater than 3  mm in diameter with the LD-CT ASiR- 70 images were 87  % and 100  %. In our study, however, when all urinary calculi were included, sensitivity and specificity when using the LD-CT ASiR- 70 images were reduced to 72  % and 94  %, respectively. It is worth noting that all ureteric calculi were retrospectively detected on the ASiR- 70 images. Important signs of pyeloureteral dilation, renal enlargement and urinary tract obstruction were correctly identified in seven out of seven patients on the LD-CT ASiR- 70 images but peri-renal stranding was missed in one patient, likely reflecting the effect of increased image noise on contrast resolution. It is important again, however, to highlight that these CT images were acquired at a <b>mean</b> <b>effective</b> <b>dose</b> of 0.48  mSv, less than the <b>mean</b> <b>effective</b> <b>dose</b> of a plain abdominal radiograph at our institution (0.7  mSv).

40|$|PURPOSE: to {{evaluate}} the <b>mean</b> <b>effective</b> radiation <b>dose</b> of 13 N-ammonia PET/CT and ECG-pulsing CT angiography (CTA) {{in the evaluation of}} myocardial perfusion, myocardial blood flow (MBF) and coronary morphology for the identification of subclinical CAD. PATIENTS, MATERIAL, METHODS: following rest-stress 13 N-ammonia PET/CT perfusion imaging and MBF quantification, ECG-pulsing CTA at a pulse window of 70 % of the R-R cycle was performed in ten healthy controls and in sixteen individuals with cardiovascular risk factors. Individual radiation dose exposure for ECG-pulsing CTA was estimated from the dose-length product. RESULTS: PET demonstrated normal perfusion in all study individuals, while hyperemic MBFs during dipyridamole stimulation and the myocardial flow reserve (MFR) in cardiovascular risk individuals were significantly lower than in healthy controls (1. 34 +/- 0. 26 vs. 2. 28 +/- 0. 47 ml/g/min and 1. 48 +/- 0. 39 vs. 3. 24 +/- 0. 81, both p</= 0. 0001). Further, ECG-pulsing CTA identified mild calcified and non-calcified coronary plaque burden in 7 (43 %) individuals of the cardiovascular risk group. Rest-stress 13 N-ammonia PET/CT perfusion study yielded a <b>mean</b> <b>effective</b> radiation <b>dose</b> of 3. 07 +/- 0. 06 mSv (2. 07 +/- 0. 06 mSv from the rest-stress 13 N-ammonia injections and 1. 0 mSv from the 2 CT transmission scans), while ECG-pulsing CTA was associated with 5. 57 +/- 2. 00 mSv. The <b>mean</b> <b>effective</b> radiation <b>dose</b> of the combined 13 N-ammonia PET/CT and ECG-pulsing CTA exams in the evaluation of myocardial perfusion and coronary morphology was 8. 0 +/- 1. 5 mSv. CONCLUSION: 13 N-ammonia PET/CT and ECG-pulsing CTA affords cardiac hybrid imaging studies in the evaluation of subclinical CAD with a relatively low <b>mean</b> <b>effective</b> radiation exposure of 8. 0 +/- 1. 5 mSv...|$|R

In the European Union, only seven countries have DRL, ranging from 200 to 400  MBq [13], with a variability of 100 % in the DRL and of 43 % in activity (Table  5).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{activity}} {{concentrations of}} 226 Ra, 232 Th and 40 K were determined in water samples. The radioactivity concentrations of 226 Ra, 232 Th, and 40 K showed large variations, so {{the results were}} classified into two groups (A and B) to facilitate {{the interpretation of the}} results. Group A represents samples collected from different locations in Assiut and characterized by low activity concentrations with average values of 0. 20, 0. 13 and 5. 29 Bql− 1 for 226 Ra, 232 Th, and 40 K, respectively. Group B represents samples mainly collected from the area around Assiut Thermal Power Plant and characterized by very high activity concentrations with average values of 7. 68 ± 3. 91, 8. 07 ± 0. 74, and 27. 20 ± 1. 79 Bql− 1 for 226 Ra, 232 Th, and 40 K, respectively. As far as the measured gamma radionuclides is concerned, the <b>mean</b> annual <b>effective</b> <b>doses</b> for analyzed samples of group A are in the range of 0. 02 – 0. 08, 0. 03 - 0. 17 and 0. 03 - 0. 10 mSv yr- 1 for infants, children and adults, respectively, all being lower than the reference level of the committed <b>effective</b> <b>dose</b> recommended by the WHO, while the <b>mean</b> annual <b>effective</b> <b>doses</b> calculated for samples of group B, all being higher than the reference level of the committed <b>effective</b> <b>dose</b> recommended by the WHO...|$|R
