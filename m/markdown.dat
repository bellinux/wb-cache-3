Unlike {{consignment}} shops, Plato's Closet pays sellers on the spot. Used clothes are purchased at between 30% and 40% of what Plato's Closet intends to sell them at. According to a 2002 article in Winston-Salem Journal, Winmark spent around $67,000 for each television advertisement for Plato's Closet. In a 2009 interview with Star Tribune, CEO John Morgan said Plato's Closet did the best during the Great Recession among Winmark's franchises because people {{were more likely to}} sell used clothing to make money and to buy used clothing to save money.|$|E

40|$|This study {{asks the}} question, {{what is the}} {{relationship}} between traditional models of market power and structural auction models? An encompassing model is derived that considers both price <b>markdowns</b> due to bid shading during an auction and price <b>markdowns</b> at the industry-level due to imperfect competition. Data from a cattle procurement experimental market is used to compare the appropriateness of the two alternative theories. Regression results show that while the number of firms is more important than the number of bidders on lot of cattle in explaining pricing behavior in the game, the number of bidders does contain some unique information and should be included in the model. Both the traditional NEIO and structural auction approaches overestimated the true <b>markdowns</b> possibly due to failure to account for the winner's curse. Marketing,...|$|R

2500|$|A {{key element}} of the Swift system {{is its ability to}} be cleanly {{debugged}} and run within the development environment, using a read–eval–print loop (REPL), giving it interactive properties more in common with the scripting abilities of Python than traditional system programming languages.

Playgrounds allow programmers to add in Swift code along with <b>markdown</b> documentation. If some code changes over time or with regard to some other ranged input value, the view can be used with the Timeline Assistant to demonstrate the output in an animated way. In addition, Xcode has debugging features for Swift development including breakpoints, step through and step over statements, as well as UI element placement breakdowns for app developers.|$|E
2500|$|During this period, {{retailers}} {{worked to}} develop modern retail marketing practices. Pioneering merchants {{who contributed to}} modern retail marketing and management methods include: [...] A. T. Stewart, Potter Palmer, John Wanamaker, Montgomery Ward, Marshall Field, Richard Warren Sears, Rowland Macy, J.C. Penney, Fred Lazarus, brothers Edward and William Filene and Sam Walton. For example, Edward Filene, a proponent of the scientific approach to retail management, developed the concept of Automatic bargain Basement. Although Filene's Basement {{was not the first}} ‘bargain basement’ in the U.S., the principles of ‘automatic mark-downs’ generated excitement and proved very profitable. Under Filene's plan, merchandise had to be sold within 30 days or it was marked down; after a further 12 days, the merchandise was further reduced by 25% and if still unsold after another 18 days, a further <b>markdown</b> of 25% was applied. If the merchandise remained unsold after two months, it was given to charity. Filene was a pioneer in employee relations. He instituted a profit sharing program, a minimum wage for women, a 40-hour work week, health clinics and paid vacations. He also {{played an important role in}} encouraging the Filene Cooperative Association, [...] "perhaps the earliest American company union". Through this channel he engaged constructively with his employees in collective bargaining and arbitration processes. [...] Montgomery Ward is credited with developing catalog sales and mail-order systems. His first catalog which was issued in August 1872 consisted of an 8in × 12in (20cm × 30cm) single-sheet price list, listing 163 items for sale with ordering instructions for which Ward had written the copy. He also devised the catch-phrase [...] "satisfaction guaranteed or your money back" [...] which was implemented in 1875.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine two key {{dimensions}} of in-store marketing, namely in-store promotions and price <b>markdowns.</b> These seem to be the two most important aspects of in-store marketing, though other dimensions such as retail personal service are also worthy of study. Design/methodology/approach - A sample of 287 New Zealand clothing and shoe retailers was studied. Survey questions included the perceived importance of in-store promotions and price <b>markdowns.</b> The aim was to explain these perceptions in terms of marketing strategies, threat of competition and environmental uncertainty. Findings - The results indicate that a discount marketing strategy, environmental uncertainty and emphasis on price-promotions are key to explaining retailers' perceptions and use of specific in-store marketing activities. In addition, seven key marketing activities were found to distinguish high- and low-performance retailers with respect to in-store promotions. Practical implications - The study has highlighted strategic aspects of in-store marketing, by focusing on two key components of in-store marketing, namely in-store promotion and price <b>markdowns.</b> The findings should provide much needed advice to retailers on the use of sales promotion tools in different environmental settings. Originality/value - This paper should prove valuable to academic researchers and retailing managers (particularly to those in smaller countries), owner-operated retail outlets, and chain stores.

40|$|Firms {{that sell}} very short life cycle {{products}} often receive quantity discounts from their suppliers and transporters for placing larger orders. Practitioners and researchers {{have begun to}} recognize the need to decide {{the end of the}} season <b>markdowns</b> by studying the sales pattern. The use of these options can affect supply chain mismatch risks and costs. In this paper, we study the impact of quantity discounts and transportation cost structures on procurement, shipment and clearance pricing decisions through a stochastic programming with recourse formulation. We propose a solution procedure that efficiently solves this stochastic non-linear problem. Our computational experiments suggest that it is not always necessary to select the most complex action plan. Under some business environments, the conventional strategy of placing and transporting a single large order is a better option. We then identify situations where options such as <b>markdowns</b> and the use of quick response suppliers could be useful. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a framework for}} estimating preferences in two-sided matching markets with non-transferable utility using only data on observed matches. Unlike single-agent choices, matches depend on the preferences of other agents in the market. I use pairwise stability together with a vertical preference restriction {{on one side of}} the market to identify preference parameters for both sides of the market. Recovering the distribution of preferences is only possible in an environment with many-to-one matching. These methods allow me to investigate two issues concerning the centralized market for medical residents. First, I examine the antitrust allegation that the clearinghouse restrains competition, resulting in salaries below the marginal product of labor. Counterfactual simulations of a competitive wage equilibrium show that residents’ willingness to pay for desirable programs results in estimated salary <b>markdowns</b> ranging from $ 23, 000 to $ 43, 000 below the marginal product of labor, with larger <b>markdowns</b> at more desirable programs. Therefore, a limited number of positions at high quality programs, not the design of the match, is the likely cause of low salaries.
