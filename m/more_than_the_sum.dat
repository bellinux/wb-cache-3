5|$|Paley's Natural Theology is an {{extended}} argument, constructed around {{a series of}} examples including finding a watch; comparing the eye to a telescope; {{and the existence of}} finely adapted mechanical structures in animals, such as joints which function like hinges or manmade ball and socket joints. Paley argues that these all lead to an intelligent Creator, and that a system is <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> of its parts. The last chapters are more theological in character, arguing that the attributes of God must be sufficient for the extent of his operations, and that God must be good because designs seen in nature are beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Stratton {{continued}} his experiments on perception, branching into studies on pseudoscopic vision, stereoscopic acuity, eye movements, symmetry and visual illusions, how people perceive depth seeing surroundings either one-eyed or two-eyed, acuity {{and limits of}} peripheral vision, apparent motion, afterimages impressed on the eye when a person stares at an object for long and then looks away, and problems with sight in half the visual field (hemianopsia). He both reviewed earlier studies on motion and conducted two of his own, concluding perceiving movement was <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> of seeing successive sequential images. He also surveyed and reported in reviews in the Psychological Bulletin experiments at various labs, including those in Europe, on matters related to sensation and perception.|$|E
5000|$|John Stuart Mill {{outlined}} {{his version}} of emergentism in System of Logic (1843). Mill argued that the properties of some physical systems, {{such as those in}} which dynamic forces combine to produce simple motions, are subject to a law of nature he called the [...] "Composition of Causes". According to Mill, emergent properties are not subject to this law, but instead amount to <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sums</b> of <b>the</b> properties of their parts.|$|R

25|$|Armstrong {{argues that}} states of affairs are {{distinct}} things in ontology {{because they are}} <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> of their parts. If some particular a has a non-symmetric relation R to another particular b, then R (a, b) differs from R (b, a). It {{may be the case}} that R (a, b) obtains in the world but R (b, a) does not. Without states of affairs instantiating the particulars and universals (including relations), we cannot account for the truth of the one case and the falsity of the other.|$|E
25|$|It has {{not been}} contested that {{cardiovascular}} risk factors tend to cluster together; the matter of contention has been the assertion that the metabolic syndrome is anything <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> of its constituent parts. Phenotypic heterogeneity (for example, represented by variation in metabolic syndrome factor combinations among individuals with metabolic syndrome) has fueled that debate. However, more recent evidence suggests that common triggers (for example, excessive sugar-intake in the environment of overabundant food) {{can contribute to the}} development of multiple metabolic abnormalities at the same time, supporting the commonality of the energy utilization and storage pathways in metabolic syndrome.|$|E
30|$|In {{holistic}} processing, recognition {{relies on}} the integration of individual stimulus parts into an emergent whole representation that is qualitatively <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>summed</b> representation of its individual parts. Face recognition is the prime example of holistic processing where recognition {{is based on the}} synthesis of facial features that yields a unique face that is <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>summed</b> recognition of each individual facial feature. Three tasks have been applied as the gold standards for testing holistic face processes: the face composite task, the parts/wholes task, and the inversion task. In the “face composite task”, it has been demonstrated that participants find it difficult to selectively attend to one half of a face (e.g., top half) while ignoring information from the other half (e.g., bottom half) (Young, Hellawell, & Hay, 1987). In the face composite task, the whole face representation makes it difficult for participants to selectively attend to one region of the face, isolated from the whole face. In the “parts/wholes task”, participants exhibit better recognition when a face part (mouth) is displayed in <b>the</b> whole face <b>than</b> when displayed in isolation (Tanaka & Farah, 1993; reviewed in Tanaka & Simonyi, 2016). The parts/wholes task demonstrates that facial features are not represented in memory as individual parts, but are integrated into a whole face representation.|$|R
50|$|The {{selling price}} of {{processed}} and stored sperm is considerably <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sums</b> received by donors. Treatments with donor sperm are generally expensive and are seldom available {{free of charge}} through national health services. Sperm banks often package treatments into e.g. three cycles, and in cases of IVF or other ART treatments, they may reduce the charge if a patient donates any spare embryos which are produced through the treatment. There is often more demand for fertility treatment with donor sperm than there is donor sperm available, and this {{has the effect of}} keeping the cost of such treatments reasonably high.|$|R

25|$|Musical {{expression}} {{is the art}} of playing or singing music with emotional communication. The elements of music that comprise expression include dynamic indications, such as forte or piano, phrasing, differing qualities of timbre and articulation, color, intensity, energy and excitement. All of these devices can be incorporated by the performer. A performer aims to elicit responses of sympathetic feeling in the audience, and to excite, calm or otherwise sway the audience's physical and emotional responses. Musical {{expression is}} sometimes thought to be produced by a combination of other parameters, and sometimes described as a transcendent quality that is <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> of measurable quantities such as pitch or duration.|$|E
500|$|Durkheim {{sought to}} create {{one of the first}} {{rigorous}} scientific approaches to social phenomena. Along with Herbert Spencer, {{he was one of the}} first people to explain the existence and quality of different parts of a society by reference to what function they served in maintaining the quotidian (i.e. by how they make society [...] "work"). He also agreed with Spencer's organic analogy, comparing society to a living organism. Thus his work is sometimes seen as a precursor to functionalism. Durkheim also insisted that society was <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> of its parts.|$|E

Later in life {{he did not}} {{consider}} {{himself to be a}} [...] "believer in the orthodox sense," [...] said he opposed religious fanaticism, and said [...] "Buddhism and Christianity are the greatest religions both in number of disciples and in importance". He also said [...] "To me, the universe is simply a great machine which never came into being and never will end" [...] and [...] "what we call 'soul' or 'spirit,' is nothing <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> of the functionings of the body. When this functioning ceases, the 'soul' or the 'spirit' ceases likewise".|$|E

500|$|Alasdair Wilkins {{writing for}} The A.V.

Wilkins found [...] "Legends Of Today" [...] and [...] "Legends Of Yesterday" [...] charming feeling they [...] "operate on a more epic scale" [...] than either show's typical episode. Oliver's paternity storyline felt creaky to Wilkins, and he noted the episodes again strained [...] "to set up the latest spin-off". Despite these faults, he found [...] "the overall effect of this crossover two-parter ... pretty damn impressive," [...] and the [...] "team-up story ... grand enough to be <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> of its parts".|$|E

And yet, for me, Barfi was a singularly frustrating experience {{there was so much}} to like, but the film never became <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> of its parts". Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave 3 out of 5 stars and said, [...] "Barfi had the potential to be great cinema, but as it stands it's a respectable film that's still better than a lot else you're likely to see." [...] On the contrary, Namrata Joshi of Outlook felt that [...] "The flashback within flashback narrative gets way too clumsy and turgid, the thriller twist absolutely pointless [...] appears much too crafted and self-consciously gorgeous, and feels eminently facile and plastic".|$|E
500|$|In , Mason Templar {{states that}} the series is not [...] "just {{one of the best}} kids' manga in translation, it's one of the very best manga {{available}} in English, period."

[...] The manga is cited as being cute by critics, and in some cases too cute; however, Anderson stated that [...] "much like Magic Knight Rayearth, even a cute story will have its depth and drama." [...] The artwork of the manga is praised for being detailed and having [...] "beautifully drawn pictures of the Clow Cards themselves." [...] The cards are described as having [...] "an artful blend of magical fantasy and reality." ...|$|E

60|$|But admitting the Rajah to {{have been}} guilty of delay and unwillingness, {{what is the nature}} of the offence?

This is the whole of it, the whole front and head of the offence; and for this offence, such as it is, and admitting that he could be legally fined for it, he was subjected to the secret punishment of giving a bribe to Mr. Hastings, by which he was to buy off the fine, and which was consequently a commutation for it.|$|R

500|$|Nicks has {{suggested}} that Fleetwood Mac created the best music when in the worst shape, while, according to Buckingham, the tensions between band members informed the recording process and led to [...] "the whole being <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> of the parts". The couple's work became [...] "bittersweet" [...] after their final split, although Buckingham still had a skill for taking Nicks' tracks and [...] "making them beautiful". The vocal harmonies between the duo and Christine McVie worked well and were captured using the best microphones available. Nicks' lyrical focus allowed the instrumentals in the songs that she wrote to be looser and more abstract. According to Dashut, all the recordings captured [...] "emotion and feeling without a middle man... or tempering". John McVie tended to clash with Buckingham about the make-up of songs, but both admit to achieving good outcomes. Christine McVie's [...] "Songbird", which Caillat felt needed a concert hall's ambience, was recorded during an all-night session at Zellerbach Auditorium, across San Francisco Bay in Berkeley.|$|E
500|$|IndieWire's Ben Travers praised Legion as [...] "the most intricate, {{intimate}} superhero {{story to}} date", highlighting {{its focus on}} [...] "an emotional journey for our leading lad", the central love story that turns the show [...] "from a 12 Monkeys mind-fuck to a Romeo & Juliet romance {{at the drop of}} a hat", and its cast. At Variety, Maureen Ryan stated that Stevens' performance [...] "is the glue that keeps Legion from flying apart", and the relationship between Haller and Barrett provides [...] "moments of solace in a viewing experience that can otherwise be exceptionally intense." [...] After the first three episodes, Ryan said that [...] "the challenge of Legion will be to make David’s quest for wholeness <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> of its flashy and often captivating parts. But the humane core of the drama offers a reason to hope for the best." [...] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "It might seem weird to have a Marvel show on FX, or to have it star that upper-crust Brit from Downton Abbey, filtered through the creator of Fargo, but somehow it all works." [...] He praised Stevens performance, and Hawley's [...] "optical hijinks" [...] even after the first episode, where the story starts to become more clear.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{praised the}} {{departure}} from other popular titles such as Square Enix's Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts series. Both the graphical presentation and the soundtrack were very well received. Reviews also commented that, initially, the character designs were too similar to previous Square Enix titles {{and may be}} off-putting to some though in the Shibuya setting they were [...] "absolutely in their element." [...] Some reviewers also complained that the Stride Cross Battle System was too complex for new players; Eurogamer's review felt the [...] "sink or swim" [...] reliance on learning the complex battle system was a significant stumbling block for the game. GamePro noted that the stylus input was imprecise, often mistaking movement and attack actions. On the other hand, the system was praised for its approach, and for the ability to alter {{the difficulty of the}} system within the game. Neku Sakuraba's character arc was praised by several reviewers, such as G4TV editor Jonathan Hunt, who praised his growth from a [...] "mute teenager" [...] to a [...] "civil human". 1UP.com's review summarized that the game is much <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> of its parts: [...] "By all rights, The World Ends With You should be an annoying disaster, a bundle of tired gimmicks and trite clichés. Yet somehow all the things that should be unbearable fall into place and create a game that's far more unique, interesting, and addictive than it has any right to be." ...|$|E

Tan Gim Ean from New Straits Times noted that Madonna played against her {{strengths}} on the songs of the album. He described her vocals as [...] "competent", but felt that the songs required [...] "more range and agility than Madonna has at her disposal." [...] Dave Tianen from Milwaukee Journal Sentinel described the album as a [...] "mixed bag of period pieces, some of them too cute for their own good", adding that [...] "I'm Breathless never becomes <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> of its mannerisms". AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine claimed that the songs are just [...] "cutesy novelty numbers", and listing [...] "Vogue" [...] as a standout track. Rooksby panned the album, saying that it [...] "failed to transcend the sterile, preserved-in-amber quality of pastiche". Mark Cooper from Q magazine lamented, in its June 1990 review, [...] "It's something of a disappointment because the lady herself stays so firmly committed to a character who's less original than the persona she evolved during the '80s." [...] Nonetheless, in the same magazine's December 1994 issue, Madonna declared: [...] "I would have to say the favorite record that I've made is the soundtrack to Dick Tracy.

[...] Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "Has Pixar lost its magic recipe? Ratatouille is filled with fairly generic animated imagery, a few modest chases, a couple of good gags, not a lot of laughs." [...] Scott Foundas of LA Weekly gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Bird has taken the raw ingredients of an anthropomorphic-animal kiddie matinee and whipped them into a heady brew about nothing less than the principles of artistic creation." [...] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "It's not just the computer animation that is vibrantly three-dimensional. It's also the well-rounded characters... I defy you to name another animated film so overflowing with superfluous beauty." [...] Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "With Ratatouille, Bird once again delivers not just a great, witty story, but dazzling visuals as well." [...] Bill Muller of The Arizona Republic gave the film four and a half stars out of five, saying [...] "Like the burbling soup that plays a key part in Ratatouille, the movie is a delectable blend of ingredients that tickles the palette and leaves you hungry for more." ...|$|E
