40|$|Although it is {{currently}} popular to reflect consumers' perspectives to <b>medical</b> <b>service</b> management, insufficient {{attempts have been made}} to understand detailed perception of the consumer side of <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> to promote <b>medical</b> services' evaluation from the consumer viewpoint. The aim of this study was to descriptively reveal how consumers perceive <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> that they receive, focusing on inpatient <b>medical</b> <b>services.</b> We conducted semi-structured interviews with 10 adults who experienced hospitalization of five or more days. Constant comparative analysis was performed on the obtained descriptive data. We identified 1) medical procedures, 2) explanations from medical professionals, 3) behavior of <b>medical</b> <b>service</b> providers, 4) somatic sensations, and 5) self-perceived physical conditions as target factors that <b>medical</b> <b>service</b> consumers perceived during hospitalization. The response to the perceived target factors, "compared with the expectation that the consumer had before the hospitalization," suggests that it is an important <b>medical</b> <b>service</b> consumer reaction to check if the service met their expectations for perceived factors. The response to the <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> perception targets suggested that <b>medical</b> <b>service</b> consumers are involved in <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> and interested in various perception targets. The expectations that <b>medical</b> <b>service</b> consumers have prior to hospitalization can largely influence inpatient <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> evaluation...|$|R
50|$|The Army <b>Medical</b> <b>Service</b> {{has been}} a {{separate}} branch within the military since the German Empire. The first Army <b>Medical</b> <b>Service</b> was established in Prussia and Germany between 1868 and 1873, and was regulated by the Kriegssanitätsordnung für das deutsche Heer from 1878. Following German rearmament in the 1950s, the <b>medical</b> <b>service</b> was reestablished based on the traditional structure, with a <b>medical</b> <b>service</b> for each military branch. This changed in 2002, when the <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> were largely merged to form the Joint <b>Medical</b> <b>Service,</b> although the Army <b>Medical</b> <b>Service</b> still exists as a much smaller organisation.|$|R

50|$|For-profit {{hospitals}} {{were more likely}} to provide profitable <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> and less likely to provide <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> that were relatively unprofitable.

For-profit hospitals were quicker to respond to changes in profitability of <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> than the other two types of hospitals.|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} whether <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> are productive for {{the improvement}} of health. The assessment of the effect of <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> on improved health is empirically difficult: individuals with failing health obtain <b>medical</b> <b>services.</b> The proposed empirical model accounts for the potential endogeneity of <b>medical</b> <b>services.</b> While a simple regression model shows that doctor visits actually increase work loss days, the estimates from the simultaneous model show that obtaining <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> reduces work loss days. For example, if an individual has influenza, obtaining <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> reduces the number of days lost at work by approximately 2. 5 days. Doctors; Health...|$|R

40|$|A better {{understanding}} of factors influencing quality of <b>medical</b> <b>service</b> can pinpoint better strategies for quality assurance in <b>medical</b> <b>services.</b> This study aimed to identify factors affecting the quality of <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> provided by Iranian physicians. Exploratory in-depth individual {{interviews were conducted with}} sixty-four physicians working in various medical institutions in Iran. Individual, organizational and environmental factors enhance or inhibit the quality of <b>medical</b> <b>services.</b> Quality of <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> depends on the personal factors of the physician and patient, and factors pertaining to the healthcare setting and the broader environment. Differences in internal and external factors such as availability of resources, patient cooperation and collaboration among providers affect the quality of <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> and patient outcomes. Supportive leadership, proper planning, education and training and effective management of resources and processes improve the quality of <b>medical</b> <b>services.</b> This article contributes to healthcare theory and practice by developing a conceptual framework for understanding factors that influence <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> quality...|$|R

40|$|Community {{pharmacies}} {{around the}} world are redefining their roles by experimenting to provide <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> directly to consumers. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> provided by community pharmacies and consumers’ usage of these <b>medical</b> <b>services.</b> This study was carried out through semi-structured interviews with both community pharmacists and their consumers in New York, Macao and Zhuhai. Community pharmacists reported information about provision of <b>medical</b> <b>services,</b> and consumers provided information about their usage of <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> at community pharmacies accordingly. Through analysis of interview materials it showed that community pharmacies mainly provided free medical examination, reference books and booklet of drug information. Some community pharmacies provided health care lecture and founded own website for medicine information. But touch-screen computer querying system and telephone health care service had not been provided. Additionally the consumers’ usage of <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> at community pharmacy is obviously lower than provision by community pharmacy. The provision level of <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> by community pharmacy was relatively low and the types of <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> were relatively narrow. There was an obvious gap between provision of <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> by community pharmacies and usage of such services by consumers. The position of community pharmacy in national health system and capability of community pharmacy have impact on the <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> of community pharmacies.

50|$|The {{history of}} the Indian <b>Medical</b> <b>Service</b> (IMS) dates back to 1612 when, on the {{formation}} of the East India Company, the Company appointed John Woodall as their first Surgeon General. Under him, medical Corps officers (mainly civilians) were recruited more or less on individual contracts. The company expanded activities in various part of the country which necessitated the formation and maintenance of regular bodies of troops in India. As a consequence, they commenced employing military surgeons from 1745 onwards. It was not until 1764 that these surgeons were made into regular establishment of the company’s armies. Thus the Bengal <b>Medical</b> <b>Service</b> was formed in 1764, the Madras <b>Medical</b> <b>Service</b> in 1767 and the Bombay <b>Medical</b> <b>Service</b> in 1779 for the three Presidency Armies of Bengal, Madras and Bombay. The three <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> were combined into the Indian <b>Medical</b> <b>Services</b> (IMS) in Apr 1886 under a Surgeon General to the Government of India. The designation was later changed into the Director General, Indian <b>Medical</b> <b>Service.</b> In 1913, the appointment was designated as the Director of <b>Medical</b> <b>Services</b> in India.|$|R
