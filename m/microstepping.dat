50|$|What is {{commonly}} referred to as <b>microstepping</b> is often sine-cosine <b>microstepping</b> in which the winding current approximates a sinusoidal AC waveform. Sine-cosine <b>microstepping</b> is the most common form, but other waveforms can be used. Regardless of the waveform used, as the microsteps become smaller, motor operation becomes more smooth, thereby greatly reducing resonance in any parts the motor may be connected to, as well as the motor itself. Resolution will be limited by the mechanical stiction, backlash, and other sources of error between the motor and the end device. Gear reducers may be used to increase resolution of positioning.|$|E
50|$|A {{stepper motor}} is a {{polyphase}} AC synchronous motor (see Theory below), {{and it is}} ideally driven by sinusoidal current. A full-step waveform is a gross approximation of a sinusoid, and {{is the reason why}} the motor exhibits so much vibration. Various drive techniques have been developed to better approximate a sinusoidal drive waveform: these are half stepping and <b>microstepping.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Recently, an {{embedding}} of the synchronous {{programming language}} Quartz (an Esterel variant) in the theorem prover HOL has been presented. This embedding {{is based on}} control flow predicates that refer to macrosteps of the pro-grams. The original semantics of synchronous languages like Esterel is however normally given at the more detailed <b>microstep</b> level. This paper describes how {{a variant of the}} Esterel <b>microstep</b> semantics has been defined in HOL and how its equivalence to the control flow predicate semantics has been proved. Beneath proving the equivalence of the micro- and macrostep semantics, the work pre-sented here is also an important extension of the existing embedding: While rea-soning at the <b>microstep</b> level is not necessary for code generation, it is sometimes advantageous for understanding programs, as some effects like schizophrenia or causality problems become only visible at the <b>microstep</b> level. ...|$|R

The desired trajectory {{of the end of}} the robot is set to be a straight line, and the desired posture of the third link is constant. The high-precision control of the hybrid stepping motor is executed with the <b>microstep</b> drive technique. The desired joint angle is obtained by the <b>microstep</b> technique and the trajectory planning method based on the inverse kinematics. From the numerical calculation results and the experimental results, it is confirmed that the trajectory tracking control of the three-degree-of-freedom semiconductor wafer transfer robot arm can be successfully executed by the present high-precision control system with <b>microstep</b> drive technique. Furthermore, the error {{of the end of the}} robot arm is theoretically investigated...|$|R
40|$|Synchronous {{programs}} are well-suited {{for the implementation}} of real-time embedded systems. However, their compilation is difficult due to the paradigm that <b>microsteps</b> are executed in zero time. This can yield cyclic dependencies that must be resolved to generate single-threaded code. State of the art techniques are based on a fixpoint computation at compile time that `simulates' the <b>microstep</b> execution. However, existing procedures do not consider delayed actions that have been recently introduced in synchronous languages. In this paper, we show that the analysis of programs with delayed actions can be performed by two fixpoint computations, one for the initialization and one for the transitions of the system. Moreover, we discuss an implementation using BDDs that is based on dual rail encoding...|$|R

5000|$|Example: {{many modern}} hybrid step motors are rated {{such that the}} travel of every full step (example 1.8 degrees per full step or 200 full steps per revolution) will be within 3% or 5% of the travel of every other full step, {{as long as the}} motor is {{operated}} within its specified operating ranges. Several manufacturers show that their motors can easily maintain the 3% or 5% equality of step travel size as step size is reduced from full stepping down to 1/10 stepping. Then, as the <b>microstepping</b> divisor number grows, step size repeatability degrades. At large step size reductions it is possible to issue many microstep commands before any motion occurs at all and then the motion can be a [...] "jump" [...] to a new position.|$|E

40|$|In situ atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) {{was used}} to study the growth mechanism of the gibbsite basal (001) face and prismatic (100) face in high ionic strength (4 M NaCl + 1 M NaOH) and highly alkaline solution (pH = 13. 4). The height of the steps on the gibbsite (001) faces can vary from less than one nanometre (elementary steps) to several nanometres (<b>microsteps)</b> and finally to dozens of nanometres (macrosteps). The lateral advancement rates of micro/macrosteps {{are related to the}} height of steps. Step coalescence occurs during lateral advancement, driven by Ostwald ripening. There are three possible pathways for the formation of micro/macrosteps on basal (001) face, all of which are controlled by layer-by-layer growth mechanism. Gibbsite structure suggests that the frequent and random formation of the elementary steps on basal (001) face can be attributed to weak inter-layer hydrogen bonds along the c-axis of gibbsite unit cell. The prismatic (100) faces are characterised by <b>microstep</b> trains along gibbsite [001] direction. These <b>microsteps</b> grow higher along gibbsite [100] direction, advance laterally and step coalescence also occurs. Two dimensional islands often form on the terrace adjacent to the edges of micro/macrosteps, suggesting that the step edge should be a preferred site for island nucleation due to the Ehrlich–Schwoebel effect...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{frequent}} use of stepping motors in robotics, automation, {{and a variety of}} precision instruments, they can hardly be found in rotational viscometers. This paper proposes the use of a stepping motor to drive a conventional constant-shear-rate laboratory rotational viscometer to avoid the use of velocity sensor and gearbox and, thus, simplify the instrument design. To investigate this driving technique, a commercial rotating viscometer has been adapted to be driven by a bipolar stepping motor, which is controlled via a personal computer. Special circuitry has been added to <b>microstep</b> the stepping motor at selectable step sizes and to condition the torque signal. Tests have been carried out using the prototype to produce flow curves for two standard Newtonian fluids (920 and 12 560 mPa (.) s, both at 25 degrees C).

A <b>microstep</b> actuator with harmonic drive provides platform angular step resolution to 0. 5 arcsec for precision pointing of instruments. An optical reference tracker boresighted with scientific instruments guarantees accurate target-referenced closed-loop pointing.

The purpose of the study is to improve the movement of the conveyor or carriage part of a machine which is driven by a bipolar stepper motor. The experiment is done on the carriage movement control with two type of driving style; direct winding control (DWC) and conductive control (CC). The performance is referred from the distance movement (axis) of the carriage machine (left right/rightleft).

40|$|Abstract—This brief {{concerns}} the formal verification of properties of statecharts, a hierarchical state machine formalism for designing control-system logic. Various semantics have been defined for statecharts {{in terms of}} the <b>microsteps</b> that determine the transitions between statechart configurations. We show how computation tree logic (CTL) specifications for a statechart can be verified using a finite-state model checker such as SMV. The inputs to the model checker are a model and an associated expansion of the CTL formula that reflect the semantics. A Kripke structure with marked states provides the formal relationship between the expanded model and the original statechart structure and CTL specification. The results apply to a general class of semantics and statecharts with bounded behaviors. The approach is illustrated with a small example.
