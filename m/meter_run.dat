40|$|Type of 80 <b>meters</b> <b>ran</b> {{is one of}} {{the numbers}} on {{athletics}} competed in early age of child. In early age, the physical condition and mind can still be developed continuously and systematically. The exercise in early age should be an element of play and competition, thus this exercise is attempted to develop the speed by two types of exercise: back to back relay <b>run</b> of 20 <b>meters</b> six reps four sets and back to back relay <b>run</b> of 30 <b>meters</b> four reps four sets. The aim of research is to know the increasing of 80 <b>meters</b> speed of <b>run.</b> The exercise was conducted for six weeks with a frequency of three times a week with the aim to increasing the speed. The numbered of sample was 24 people selected randomly from junior high school students of Dharma Praja Badung that meets the requirements of inclusion and exclusion. The numbered of each group consists of twelve people. Each group was given a different treatment i. e. group I was treated by back to back relay <b>run</b> of 20 <b>meters</b> six reps and four sets and group II treated by back to back relay <b>run</b> of 30 <b>meters</b> four reps four sets. Data derived from the duration time of 80 <b>meters</b> <b>ran</b> before and after exercise, with t paired test to determine the difference average speed of duration time before and after exercise in each group. The t Unpaired test for the difference average of increased speed between two groups with significance limit of 0. 05. The differences of speed in 80 <b>meters</b> <b>ran</b> after exercise in both groups showed significant differences, i. e. p = 0. 000 (p < 0. 05). The average of duration time of 80 <b>meters</b> <b>ran</b> in Group I before exercise was 13. 51 sec and after exercise was 12. 31 sec by difference of 1. 16 seconds show significant differences, while Group 2 the average of duration time in 80 <b>meters</b> <b>ran</b> before exercise and after exercise was 13. 66 and after 12, 67 by a difference of 0. 98 seconds showed significant differences due to differences in distance and number of repetitions between Group I and Group II. The results showed that the training in group I and group II can improve the speed of duration time in 80 <b>meters</b> <b>ran.</b> Thus, coaches and athletic trainers are expected to implement the back to back relay <b>run</b> 20 <b>meters</b> six reps four sets...|$|R
