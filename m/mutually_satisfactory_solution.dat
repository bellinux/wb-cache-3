It arguably makes sense to ask if it would make sense to change the arbitration procedure, in order to better achieve the aims of WTO dispute settlement...|$|E
30|$|Motivated by {{the above}} discussion, we design a new C-RAN {{resource}} sharing {{scheme based on}} the Indian game model. The key feature of our scheme {{is to develop a}} decentralized mechanism according to the two-level coopetition approach. The term “coopetition” is a neologism coined to describe cooperative competition. Therefore, coopetition is defined as the phenomenon that differs from competition or cooperation and stresses two faces, i.e., cooperation and competition, of one relationship in the same situation [8]. In this study, our proposed game model consists of two levels: the upper- and lower-level Indian buffet games. At the upper-level game, cloud resources are shared in a cooperative manner. At the lower-level game, allocated resources are distributed in a non-cooperative manner. Based on the hierarchical interconnection of the two game models, control decisions can cause cascade interactions to reach a <b>mutually</b> <b>satisfactory</b> <b>solution.</b>|$|E
40|$|Significance {{of family}} {{mediation}} {{in the resolution}} of legal conflicts in a family The purpose of my thesis is to analyse the issue of family mediation. Family mediation which {{is a form of}} Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) could be defined as a structured process in which family members agree to appoint a neutral third party (the mediator) who assists them to find a <b>mutually</b> <b>satisfactory</b> <b>solution</b> to their problem based on their own decisions. The mediator must be impartial, their role is to encourage communication between the parties but has no authority to make any substantial suggestions or decisions with regard to the parties' issues. The mediation process is voluntary and confidential. One of the reasons why I chose this topic is my belief that family mediation can be in many cases a more suitable way to solve family conflicts than litigation. In many foreign countries (especially western European countries, the USA and Canada) mediation has a long history and is used frequently to solve conflicts that relate to separation, divorce, custody, financial questions in family etc. In the Czech Republic, however, family mediation has not been developed very well and I find this situation unfavorable.

Many of the procedures and methods proposed previously have used biological and/or psychological principles, models, and data; here, we focus on models which look for a greater degree of coherence. Therefore we analyse and compare all aspects of the Gluck–Thompson and Hawkins ANN models. A multithread computer model is developed for analysis of these models in order to study simple learning phenomena in a marine invertebrate (Aplysia californica) and to check their applicability to research in psychology and neurobiology. The predictive capacities of the models differs significantly: the Hawkins model provides a better analysis of the behavioural repertory of Aplysia on both the associative and the non-associative learning level. The scope of the ANN modelling technique is broadened by integration with neurobiological and behavioural models of associative learning, allowing enhancement of some architectures and procedures that are currently being used...|$|R

It is a proactive approach to conflict and dispute resolution that provides a way for project partners to anticipate potential problems with <b>mutually</b> <b>satisfactory</b> <b>solutions.</b> However, traditional dispute resolution techniques such as mediation, arbitration and litigation, which can be both expensive and time-consuming, tend to be confrontational and fail to reach a win-win situation, hence ultimately posing a threat for the industry in the long term. Unlike many western countries,partnering was not adopted within the Hong Kong construction industry until 1994 for a public hospital project, yet has proved to be no less an effective procurement means in improving the traditional adversarial working culture and reducing intractable construction disputes and conflicts over the past 16 years. This paper presents a timely and in-depth review of the implementation and effectiveness of project partnering in reducing disputes within the Hong Kong construction industry through planned structured interviews, case studies and an empirical questionnaire survey, and seeks further improvements to the application of partnering and dispute resolution. The research study will identify the causes of construction disputes and analyze their importance; examine whether and how partnering can minimize the occurrence of construction disputes; evaluate the satisfaction level of various project team members on dispute resolution via partnering; and conclude by suggesting recommendations for avoiding and mitigating construction disputes and claims using the partnering approach.

40|$|The EC’s {{implementation}} {{record in}} the WTO seems to reflect an attitude that, {{in accordance with the}} view traditionally maintained by the European Court of Justice from International Fruit to Portugal, finds its cornerstone in the principle of negotiations with a view to achieving <b>mutually</b> <b>satisfactory</b> <b>solutions,</b> even beyond the limits set by the DSU. Following these premises, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to analyse the impact that has been exercised on the EC’s contentious practice by interpretations of the WTO system given by the EC courts, in fine tuning with the stand taken by the EC’s political bodies. After having considered the legal and political reasons behind the case-law of the Community’s courts on ‘direct effect’, the paper attempts to analyse to what extent the EC’s conduct in the framework of the WTO dispute settlement process has been influenced by the ‘scope for manoeuvre’ argument, devised by the ECJ in the Portugal ruling. It will become clear that an approach mainly aimed at preserving the balance of mutual advantages among the WTO Members queries the role played in the dispute settlement mechanism by the agreements between parties. An analysis is submitted of four different categories of agreements concluded by the EC in the framework of the dispute settlement mechanism, also in cases not expressly provided by the DSU. On a higher level of investigation, the ‘scope for manoeuvre’ approach is strictly connected with another widely discussed issue, namely the nature of the legal obligations entered into by WTO Member States. The study aims to demonstrate that WTO rules are a source of rights and obligations that are disposable in nature for Member Parties...|$|R
40|$|In theory, the WTO dispute {{settlement}} system is expected, via an elaborate system of sequential legal maneuvers {{to ensure the}} implementation of the {{dispute settlement}} body (DSB) recommendations. In reality when trade issues rise above some critical threshold to a respondent, the theory behind the DSU enforcement breaks down and the well meaning legal system only leads to prolonging the dispute rather than resolving it. Since 1995, more than 300 complaints have been filed through the WTO dispute settlement system. In most cases, the parties reach a <b>mutually</b> <b>satisfactory</b> <b>solution</b> in accordance with the WTO Agreements through consultations without having recourse to the panel and Appellate Body review. When the consultation process fails the resulting process of Panel reports and Appellate Body reports result in a removal or modification of the violating measures. In those cases where there is no removal or modification of the violating measures, the period of non-compliance tends to be very long and leads to core questions about the true intent of the DSU. In particular, was the DSU designed to ensure a legal process for the settlement of a dispute and to recommend a remedy to the offending violation but was not designed to secure compliance. The intent {{of this paper is to}} show that this is indeed the case. Moreover, if one treats the WTO as a contract, then the non-compliance issue may be viewed as an `efficient breach' and the only efficient remedy is a `fine' rather than the usual practice of suspension of concessions or other obligations to the offending Member. Under our suggested enforcement rules, it may be possible for a Member to continue to breach her obligation to the WTO contract while simultaneously compensating for damages created by the offending measure. The end result will be more efficient than the current system of diplomatic maneuvering designed to pressure the Member to remove or modify the offending measure. ...|$|E
40|$|Conflict {{mediation}} is {{a structured}} intervention by an impartial mediator, which aims at the conflict resolution by facilitating communication between {{two or more}} conflict parties (e. g., Kressel, 2006; Moore, 2003). Impartiality of the mediator means that she or he is not involved and does not take sides in the conflict. The general aim of mediation usually encompasses a <b>mutually</b> <b>satisfactory</b> <b>solution</b> of the conflict, an improvement (or satisfactory termination) of the relation of conflict parties, and an empowering and satisfactory mediation process (e. g., Bush & Folger, 2004; Herrman, 2006; Wall & Dunne, 2012). Mediation is applied in various fields of intergroup conflict. The fields of labor conflict, environmental conflict, or international conflict {{are among the most}} prominent ones (e. g., Bercovitch & Fretter, 2007; Bingham et al., 2002; DeRouen et al., 2011; Hiltrop, 1989; LaPlant Turkiewicz & Allen, 2014). With three experiments in three different contexts, we confirmed the hypothesis that mediation increases positive attitudes between groups in conflict. While most of the prior research on mediation effectiveness lacked either internal or external validity, we evaluated mediation with strong concerns for both. Applying experimental designs under controlled conditions supported the internal validity of our results. Having professional mediators conduct semi-structured mediations in real conflicts supported the external validity of our results (cf. Shadish et al., 2002). By applying other success measures than the common agreement rate, we furthermore increased the construct validity (cf. McGillis, 1997). While in our studies the agreement rate did not differentiate between experimental and control condition, we could detect differences in intergroup relations. Finally, by conducting structural equation modeling, we increased the reliability of our results (cf. Brown, 2006). With the three studies, we used an experimental causal chain design (cf. Spencer et al., 2005), which applies the most rigorous test for causality – the experimental design (cf. Shadish et al., 2002) – in the test of statistical mediation hypotheses. Therewith, we provided strong evidence for the psychological process we assumed: Mediation increases mutual empathy between conflict parties and therewith supports more positive intergroup attitudes and liking. With our third study, we furthermore suggested that not only empathy for the other, but also feeling heard by her or him supports conflict resolution. This finding added to the severely understudied field of perspective giving (cf. Goldstein et al., 2014). Generally, our results shed valuable first light on the psychological processes of effective mediation in intergroup conflict (cf., Pruitt, 2011; Wall et al., 2001). Our research points toward several directions how to further investigate mediation in intergroup conflict: We discussed various possibilities to evaluate mediation with internally valid designs without losing concern for the external validity of results. Moreover, we strongly recommend extending our research by for instance investigating the effects of specific mediation styles or comparing the psychological processes and needs for minority and majority groups in mediation. Considering the divide of researchers investigating mediation in the field and in the laboratory, as well as the divide of mediation research and practice, we hope for a more cooperative and dialogical, shortly, a more mediation-like, approach to mediation in the future. Experience has shows that both sides can learn from each other and that cooperation is a profitable endeavor for all involved...|$|E
40|$|The World Trade Organization (WTO) has two roles. The {{first is}} legislative, where the WTO is an {{international}} organization in which agreements are signed. The other is judiciary, where the WTO {{is an international}} adjudicator deciding trade disputes. The first one {{is limited to the}} conduct of trade relations among Members. The second one is to conduct [litigation] brought pursuant to the consultation and dispute settlement provisions of WTO covered agreements. Forced compliance via binding dispute settlement should, theoretically, ensure that each member of an international organization receives all the benefits to which it is entitled, and that no country is required to make concessions to which it has not agreed and which have not been paid for. Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) of the WTO, arising from the Uruguay Round negotiations, is generally considered to be the crown jewel of the WTO trading system. Much has been written about its functioning, also a few studies in Polish literature. Since 1995, almost 400 complaints have been filled through the WTO dispute settlement system. The parties often reach a <b>mutually</b> <b>satisfactory</b> <b>solution</b> through consultations in accordance with the WTO Agreements without needing recourse to the panel and Appellate Body review. However, if that fails, the panels, the Appellate Body and the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) are supposed to resolve the conflict. Only a Member that believes that its benefits have been nullified or impaired by the available measures is entitled to bring a matter before the dispute settlement system. Furthermore, the DSB makes recommendations only when the benefits are found to be nullified or impaired by the measures. This structure indicates the bilateral nature of the WTO dispute settlement system. However, the WTO DSU should not only be seen as a court. In every case, where the agreements cannot be clarified through negotiations, the dispute settlement system serves as their surrogate. The WTO DSU system is better than its GATT predecessor. In general, the system is good and successful. However, it is not free of errors, which I will try to point out. This will be a legal analysis only, without political judgment. Before I proceed with the analysis, the notion of dispute should be clarified. In international law the term dispute means a specific disagreement relating to a question of rights or interests in which the parties proceed by the way of claims, counter-claims, denials and so on. In another definition, dispute in international law is a situation when one entity of international law demands from another one specific action or behavior and such a demand is based on the rules of international law binding for both parties and this other entity resists this action or behaviour. The term dispute is therefore different from the notion of conflict, which means a general state of hostility between the parties. The distinction is important, since opposite to the conflicts, disputes are not entirely undesirable and may have certain valuable characteristics such as an effect of law clarification. In the context of the WTO Dispute Settlement system, the term dispute stands for a situation in which one WTO Member State adopts a trade policy or measure or takes some action, that one or more concerned WTO Members consider to be a breach of the WTO Agreements or a failure to meet obligations under such agreements. In such situation those countries undertake steps with accordance to the Dispute Settlement Understanding. This definition is broad, because the dispute does not arise when a Member State demands ruling of a panel, but already when parties take other available steps (e. g. negotiations) to solve the disagreement between them.

40|$|Introducing e-books into Swedish {{libraries}} {{has been}} influenced by the idea of equal access to all media for all Swedish citizens as well as by librarians’ wish to provide the best possible service to their users. Libraries perceived this new resource and service as a way of fulfilling their specific function in a democratic society, which is usually described as mediation (or transfer) of knowledge and culture to all. This is a common basis for the incorporation of new media and information resources (including e-books) into Swedish academic and public libraries. Apart from this common platform, we see other similarities in working with e-books in both types of libraries, but also a number of differences. Most of them relate to the position of libraries within their respective context and in relation to their specific role. Academic libraries are quite influential players in the global scholarly communication and supporters of both research and study processes. As such they are embedded in a mainly international market of scientific information and scholarly materials. They have significant resources provided by their parent universities for the acquisition of scholarly material and a wide choice of commercially available material from different providers. They are also incorporated into a national library consortium with great negotiation power. Thus, they have more freedom to experiment with a variety of business and pricing models offered on the international market. They also have a high competence in publishing and are often publishers themselves. Their involvement in research processes and in open access initiatives puts them in a position to provide expertise to researchers in the areas of publishing and intellectual property protection. Public libraries are part of the local cultural and educational landscape. As such, they depend on the production of media and content in national languages which helps cater to the needs and demands of the local population. They are also customers on the limited market of publishing, entertainment and education-related materials which help fulfil their function as educators. As public libraries offer open and free access to their resources to the entire population of a certain area, eventually covering the whole country, they are regarded as a disruptive element in the market economy. This perceived threat from public libraries was reborn with the emergence of e-books. Despite their differences, both academic and public libraries face similar challenges and problems relating to the management of their collections, creating metadata, and providing access to their content.
