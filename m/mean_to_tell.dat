500|$|Throughout the song, {{the narrator}} {{addresses}} an unidentified girl, asking [...] "When {{will you come}} with me", and lamenting {{the fact that she}} laughs at him for having nothing to his name. He tells her he wants to give her his hopes and bring her freedom, that [...] "the earth is turning under your feet" [...] and [...] "the waters of life are flowing free", yet she persists in scorning him. He asks why she laughs at the pack he carries on his back, and he wonders why he keeps on going, with nothing to his name. At last, he tells her that he has waited for a long time, and that this is his final plea: he wants to grab her by the hands, to [...] "take you away with me". As he sees her hands tremble, and her eyes [...] "overflow with tears", he asks her, [...] "Do you really <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me, you love me as I am?" ...|$|E
500|$|Clayton's {{findings}} did {{not have}} any practical application {{until the end of the}} 18th century. The gas produced during the coking of coal was allowed to escape unused until William Murdoch began to promote coal gas as an illuminant. Other such experiments, though limited in depth, had been done by: George Dixon in 1780 in Cockfield, Jean-Pierre Minckelers in 1785 in Louvain, and Archibald Cochrane in 1787 at his estate Culross Abbey. The true prototypes for later gasworks were first constructed in 1802 at the Soho Foundry and in 1805 at George Lee's cotton mill in Salford close to Manchester. However innovative the new technology, it was met with great skepticism by many critics. As late as 1810 Murdock was asked in a committee of the House of Commons: [...] "Do you <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> us that it will be possible to have a light without a wick?" [...] Not until the second decade of the 19th century did gaslight spread from industrial mills to urban street lighting and domestic lighting. Accum played a crucial role in this unfolding revolution.|$|E
500|$|By July, it was {{becoming}} obvious that the ice was likely to crush the Endurance, which creaked and trembled under the pressure, and Shackleton instructed Worsley {{to be prepared to}} quickly abandon ship if the need arose. Worsley was initially incredulous, asking Shackleton: [...] "You seriously <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me that the ship is doomed?" [...] Shackleton responded [...] "The ship can't live in this, Skipper." [...] Finally, on 24 October, the pressure of the ice caused the stern post of the Endurance to twist and the ship began to quickly let in water. After desperate attempts to fix the leak and pump the ship dry, Shackleton gave the order to abandon ship three days later. [...] Salvaging what essential supplies they could, the expedition set out on 30 October for Robertson Island, [...] to the northeast. After just three days, {{it was clear that the}} condition of the ice was too rough for sledging. Having travelled only a mile and a half (2.4km) from where the Endurance was sinking, they set up camp to wait for the ice to break up. Lumber and tents were salvaged from the crushed ship, which was still not fully submerged, and a reasonable camp, known as Ocean Camp, was established. [...] The expedition stayed here for two months until 23 December, when they struck camp.|$|E

2500|$|The State of Nebraska then {{appealed to}} the U.S. Supreme Court. [...] The Supreme Court decided Wolff v. Rice, along with a {{landmark}} Fourth Amendment case, Stone v. Powell (July 6, 1976), 428 US 465. The Court held that Fourth Amendment claims {{would no longer be}} appealed through the federal courts on a writ of habeas corpus. Beginning with Stone v. Powell, state prisoners could only appeal Fourth Amendment claims to the U.S. Supreme Court on a writ of certiorari from the state's supreme court. Rice's appellate counsel, Father William Cunningham, a Jesuit priest, said to the U.S. Supreme Court during oral arguments, [...] "Do you <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> my client, after all this time, that he has pursued the wrong legal avenue?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But...!" [...] Mr. Bennett {{was doing}} sums on his fingers. [...] "Do you <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me," [...] he demanded, having {{brought out the}} answer to his satisfaction, [...] "do you <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me {{that you have been}} engaged to three men in three weeks?" ...|$|E

"That is {{precisely}} what I <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you," [...] returned the hardware man, [...] "and I <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you, moreover, that your son has been very irregular of late in his attendance, and that {{on more than one}} occasion he has come here drunk." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{people also}} tell folktales, which involve all the people. They are {{understood}} to be fictional. These traditional tales also give moral or social lessons to youth, and are told for amusement about the way people are.

60|$|It was inspiring {{to see my}} team {{practice}} that afternoon. There had come a subtle change. I foresaw one of those baseball climaxes that can be felt and seen, but not explained.

50|$|Akhyana {{literally}} <b>means</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> or narrate in Sanskrit. The 12th century polymath Hemchandra defined Akhyana in his Kavyanusashana as a {{side story}} from religious texts narrated by Granthika (professional story teller) to instruct audience accompanied by singing and acting. This definition {{does not include the}} narration of other non-mythological stories like that of Narsinh Mehta. In general, Akhyana can be defined as the stories narrated by story teller for religious instructions to audience accompanied by singing and acting. Dolarrai Mankad defined it as a form of poetry with musical components and scope of acting.|$|R

Never had I been so angry. I began to fight back, to punch and kick him.|$|R
