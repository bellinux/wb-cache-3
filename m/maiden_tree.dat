In field besides the laser scanning, were collected DBH with caliper, total height with haga hypsometer and digital photos for verification and comparison between aspects dendrological with laser data. With literature support was prepared a interpretation key for verification main aspects of tree like habit, size, stem form, bark, branches and crown. The DBH and total height were according between laser data and field measurements. The laser scanning showed efficient to determining habit, size, crown aspects and bark of tree. However, branches and leaves identification werent possible due of data lack at the stem top and the lidar technology were not provide such specific data. For future studies, automated methods of extraction for this informations are necessary which will be of big importance in studies of ecological forests, stands and urban landscape.

40|$|Abstract. Six {{types of}} {{rootstocks}} were planted at Warsaw-Wilanow, Central Poland in spring 2002 : three originated from Pyrus communis – Caucasian pear seedlings, OHxF 333 and 'Pyrodwarf ' and three from Cydonia oblonga – quinces S 1, MA and MC. In August they were budded with Conference and Erika pear cultivars. Mid-shoot leaves, {{taken at the}} end of August from rootstocks (in 2002) and from maidens budded on them (in 2003) were analysed for Ca, Mg, P and K content. Rootstocks differed significantly in the content of all mineral elements studied. They also affected the leaf mineral composi-tion of maiden trees budded on them. The leaf Ca, P and K content depended on cultivar as well. A significant interaction of rootstock × cultivar on the leaf P and K content in <b>maiden</b> <b>tree</b> leaves was also noted. It has been suggested that the information about a spe-cific abilities of rootstocks to absorb particular nutrients may serve as an additional indi-cator in selection of optimal rootstock for certain soil conditions...|$|E

The height of trees, the diameter of stems, {{and the length of}} lateral shoots were measured. The air temperature and precipitation higher than the long-term mean (by approximately 10 % and 28 %, respectively) contributed to the increase in the stem diameter, the total length of shoots, and the number of shoots per tree. The length of lateral shoots increased {{from the top of the}} crown towards the lower parts, however, the number of feathers per tree and the mean length of shoots decreased. A strong positive relationship (r = 0. 74, P < 0. 05) was revealed between the stem diameter and the total length of shoots.

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} shown that {{internal}} nitrogen (N) translocation in temperate tree species is governed by photoperiod duration and temperature. For tropical tree species, the seasonality of rainfall is known to affect growth and foliage production, suggesting that efficient internal N recycling also occurs throughout the year.

Hill ex <b>Maiden)</b> <b>trees</b> from a plantation in coastal Congo on poor sandy soil. The trees were sampled {{at the end of the}} dry season and late in the rainy season. Lower N concentrations and N investment in the non-structural fraction were observed in leaves during the dry season, which indicates resorption of non-structural N from senescing leaves. Stem wood, which contributes to about 60 % of the total biomass of the trees, accumulated high amounts of non-structural N at the end of the dry season, most of which was remobilized during the following rainy season. These results support the hypothesis of efficient internal N recycling, which may be an important determinant for the growth potential of eucalypts on N-poor soils. Harvesting trees late in the rainy season when stem wood is depleted in non-structural N should be recommended to limit the export of nutrients off-site and to improve the sustainability of tropical eucalypt plantations...|$|R

These researches were focused on the following aspects: the ability to rebuild rootstock root system after transplanting in the field, according to the method of vegetative propagation and growth of the budding trees, the compatibility of the budded union, the resistance of the rootstocks to Blumeriella jaapii and the yield of grafted trees. To better highlight certain characteristics in vegetative rootstocks have been made comparisons with generative rootstocks „Semavium” and „VG- 1 ”. Of the recorded data it was found a better establishment to the vegetative rootstocks due to their ability to form adventitious roots and a constant and uniform growth rate until the beginning of October; witch led to a better percent of bud take comparisons with generative rootstocks.

40|$|Summary We {{compared}} {{the effects of}} nitrogen fertilization on shoot hydraulic architecture and leaf photosynthetic proper-ties of Eucalyptus grandis Hill ex <b>Maiden</b> <b>trees</b> in Hawaii. It was hypothesized that water transport capacity would adjust to nutrient availability, with leaf specific hydraulic conductivity (kl) increasing in fertilized trees in coordination with higher photosynthetic capacity per unit leaf area. Trees were grown from seedlings {{in the field for}} 10 months at four rates of nitro-gen (N) fertilization between 0 and 336 kg ha– 1. Leaf water po-tentials, photosynthetic capacity and k l were measured before whole shoots were harvested to determine total growth, leaf area and sapwood density. Mean tree height increased from 4 to 5. 3 m, stem basal area increased from 27 to 67 cm 2 and to-tal leaf area increased from 15 to 40 m 2 between the lowest and highest rates of fertilizer addition. When trees were compared on the basis of leaf nitrogen per unit area (Narea), light-saturated rates of photosynthesis on an area and mass basis and the maxi-mum rate of electron transport all increased from 50 % to more than 100 % as Narea increased from 0. 8 to 2. 1 g m– 2. Branch spe-cific hydraulic conductivity (ks) and kl increased with height in the crown. However, there was no change in branch kl or the ra-tio of leaf area to sapwood area of the whole shoot in response to fertilization, and ks and density of the sapwood were unre-lated to leaf Narea. In contrast to photosynthesis, stomatal con-ductance did not respond to fertilization, leading to decreased internal carbon dioxide partial pressure (pi/pa) in fertilized plants and similar leaf water potentials in all plants. Consistent with the behavior of pi/pa, carbon isotope discrimination de-creased by 2 ‰ with increasing leaf Narea, supporting the con-clusion that intrinsic water-use efficiency was enhanced by fertilization. Increased growth in response to fertilization in-volved adjustment at the leaf level rather than a change in the balance between water transport capacity and leaf area. It is proposed that, when there are changes in leaf properties with-out any external change in water availability or evaporative de-mand, leaf photosynthesis and stomatal conductance are partially constrained by the hydraulic architecture of the tree...|$|R

MAIDENiso only requires daily input data: minimal and maximal air temperatures, amount of precipitation, CO 2 atmospheric concentration, and delta C- 13 in CO 2. MAIDENiso simulates tree-ring width, delta O- 18 in precipitation (delta O- 18 (P)), delta O- 18 in soil water (delta O- 18 (SW)), delta O- 18 in xylem water (delta O- 18 (XW)), delta O- 18 in cellulose (delta O- 18 (TRC)), and delta C- 13 in cellulose (delta C- 13 (TRC)).

Converting the girth of largest trunk into rough age estimates by using an existing regression formula gave an approximate minimum (~ 29 years), maximum (~ 186 years), median (~ 58 years) and average age of ~ 64 years (error of ~ 15 years). For trees with trunks after fire, 96. 5 % had lost all existing leaves. Nearly all trees (95 %) had shoots from the lignotuber, but only 4. 25 % of trees had also epicormic shoots on trunks and stems. Size/age were related to some but not all measures of regeneration. In the future, existing trunks could senesce, with nearly all regrowth from the lignotubers. This could result in a change from open woodlands with large/old trees with a few trunks to closed woodlands of lower-growing trees with a mallee form.

40|$|Hedging is used {{to control}} tree size in {{macadamia}} orchards, but the effects on subsequent shoot growth and floral initiation may impair fruit production. Four-year-old grafted macadamia (Macadamia integrifolia <b>Maiden</b> & Betche) <b>trees</b> were subjected to pruning {{of the most recent}} seasonal shoot in autumn and spring. Factorial combinations of treatments included girdling or not girdling near the base of the previous season 2 ̆ 7 s (parent) shoot; removal of all except two, four or six leaves from the parent shoot; and defoliation or no defoliation of the shoot that appeared after pruning. Initial numbers and dimensions of flush-shoot internodes were similar for all branch treatments in autumn and for girdled branches in spring, and were smaller than half those for non-girdled stems in spring. Later flush-shoot growth depended on the number of leaves retained on the parent shoot, {{the presence or absence of}} a connection to the tree below the parent shoot, and on the season, declining with limiting growing degree-days in winter and accelerating with increasing growing degree-days in summer. In both seasons, reserves beyond the parent (previous season 2 ̆ 7 s) shoot contributed the major source of carbohydrate for continuing flush-shoot growth, and particularly the growth of leaves. The combinations of seasonal conditions, shoot parameters before the commencement of flush-shoot growth, and flush-shoot morphology permit the inference of allometric relationships that can be applied to the quantitative modelling of vegetative shoot morphology and growth in macadamia...|$|R
5000|$|In 1958, Jane Jacobs {{described}} the street, {{in an essay}} that was later characterized as a [...] "spirited rebuttal to the antiseptic urban renewal that was gospel at the time": Starting with nothing more remarkable than the dirty, neglected back sides of department stores and nondescript buildings, a group of merchants made this alley {{into one of the}} finest shopping streets in America. <b>Maiden</b> Lane has <b>trees</b> along its sidewalks, redwood benches to invite the sightseer or window shopper or buyer to linger, sidewalks of colored paving, sidewalk umbrellas when the sun gets hot. All the merchants do things differently: some put out tables with their wares, some hang out window boxes and grow vines. All the buildings, old and new, look individual; the most celebrated is an expanse of tan brick with a curved doorway, by architect Frank Lloyd Wright. The pedestrian's welfare is supreme; during the rush of the day, he has the street. Maiden Lane is an oasis with an irresistible sense of intimacy, cheerfulness, and spontaneity. It is one of San Francisco's most powerful downtown magnets. Downtown can't be remade into a bunch of Maiden Lanes; and it would be insufferably quaint if it were. But the potential illustrated can be realized by any city and in its own particular way. Jane Jacobs In 1961, the San Francisco Chronicle's columnist Herb Caen praised Maiden Lane as [...] "a busy little block of intriguing shops." ...|$|R
