Criss commented: [...] "That's the trouble with {{having a lot of}} {{officials}} around. I've shaved a thousand men with that axe and that's the first time I ever drew blood.

500|$|... "Marry <b>Me</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little,</b> Marry <b>Me</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> More" [...] {{was written}} by Jeff Greenstein and Bill Wrubel and was {{directed}} by series producer James Burrows. It was the one-hundredth episode of Will & Grace, and the producers celebrated the milestone by planning an hour-long episode followed by a clip show featuring highlights and outtakes from past seasons. In an interview with The Jewish Journal in 2001, David Kohan, the co-creator of Will & Grace, in discussing the lead characters, stated that a marriage {{could be a problem}} for the dynamic between the two characters: [...] "I'd love for [...] to find a Jewish love interest, but that relationship might actually work, and then there'd be no more 'Will & Grace'." [...] Kohan, however, changed his mind by the time of a follow-up interview in 2002: he noted that the characters had to [...] "move on forward in their lives in some way" [...] and it would be unlikely that Grace's possible husband would displace her gay best friend, Will. In July 2002, reports surfaced that a possible wedding involving Grace would happen, but the staff were not allowed to reveal anything.|$|E

Piquet later complained that he was blocked during his first-session run by Vettel: [...] "During my lap, Vettel was in front of me, which {{unsettled}} <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> although the FIA felt that he did not impede me."

[...] "I would have gotten one of the houses", Sarria claimed, [...] "but he only gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> money and one ring. He claimed that was all Paul wanted me to have. He was so evil. He said afterwards, 'If you expect anything else, you're {{not going to get}} it.'" ...|$|E

500|$|In the {{beginning}} it took <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> while {{to get used to}} the new idea of the sound, not having any screaming vocals and stuff like that. [...] But I think the album was necessary for us to do. Maybe the band wouldn't have continued if we hadn't done Heritage. [...] I think the old Opeth fans understand this album. There's always going to be some haters, but you can't be loved by everyone. Opeth has always been about not repeating ourself. A lot of people don't think Heritage is metal but I think it's metal to go somewhere people don't expect. It doesn't mean we're not embracing the past sound of Opeth.|$|E
500|$|... 11 was {{originally}} {{going to be}} an acoustic record, aiming for the [...] "soft-hard approach" [...] perfected by the British rock group, The Who. However, after a long tour, some of the acoustic songs started growing on him, which led to changes. Adams would record for a few hours, until he wheeled the whole recording kit back onstage. [...] "It makes <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more interested in going on tour," [...] he said in retrospect. Adams who was never fully committed to the idea of creating a full-fledged acoustic album, decided not to after seeing an acoustic band opening for him during one of his concerts. What he saw made him certain that {{he was not able to}} create such an album.|$|E

Yet while it's hard to explain exactly why, it works. It entertains me. At times, it makes me laugh; at times, it makes <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> misty-eyed; at times, {{it makes me want}} to scream and howl and light things on fire and break windows with baseball bats and yes, maybe even buy a Vespa. That's the kind of success that you just can't argue with." ...|$|E

500|$|Individual Beatles later commented {{about their}} {{memories}} of Hamburg, with Lennon reflecting, [...] "We'd outlived the Hamburg stage {{and wanted to}} pack that up. We hated going back to Hamburg those last two times. We'd had that scene. Brian [...] made us go back to fulfill the contract...". Harrison had positive memories of the period: [...] "I'd have to say with hindsight that Hamburg bordered on the best of Beatles times. We didn't have any luxury, we didn't have any bathrooms or any clothes, we were pretty grubby, we couldn't afford anything, {{but on the other}} hand we weren't yet famous, so we didn't have to contend with the bullshit that comes with fame." [...] McCartney was philosophical: [...] "Hamburg was certainly a great childhood memory. But I think all things are enhanced by time. It was very exciting, though I think it felt better to <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> later in our career, once we'd started to get a bit of success with the records." ...|$|E
500|$|Munnerlyn {{is active}} with March of Dimes charities, a cause {{close to his}} heart as he was a {{premature}} baby himself. When asked why his name is Captain, Munnerlyn said, [...] "My momma promised my grandmomma that she could name the last child. I was the boy of the family, and she named me Captain. Her great grandfather was named Captain, so I got named after my great-great grandfather. My sisters and brothers have normal names. I got the odd name. In the beginning {{it was kind of}} rough. Kids used to tease <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> but it fits my personality, because I feel like I'm a leader." [...] Munnerlyn majored in criminal justice while at South Carolina, where he was teammates and roommates with former Viking linebacker Jasper Brinkley. He was named the 2015 Korey Stringer Good Guy Award winner by media covering the Vikings. Munnerlyn is married to Lakisha and has two sons, Captain and Champ, and daughter, Eden. [...] Munnerlyn now serves on the board of his condominium association in alongside Charlotte based truck owner, Jeremy Thomas.|$|E
500|$|After {{graduating from}} Michigan, Bump {{turned down an}} offer to play {{professional}} football for the Detroit Lions, saying {{he said he had}} obtained a job in Chicago outside of football. [...] Elliott also considered going into medicine as his father had done, but he chose instead to go into coaching. [...] He started his coaching career at Michigan in the fall of 1948 as assistant backfield coach. [...] In the spring of 1949, he was hired as an assistant coach under Kip Taylor at Oregon State, where he remained for three seasons, from 1949â€“1951. [...] Elliott later recalled, [...] "I was only 24 when Kip Taylor hired me as backfield coach at Oregon State, and it bothered <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> because there were two backs on the squad who were older than I was." [...] It was even worse for his brother Pete, who was 22 when he was hired to coach the ends. [...] Bump recalled: [...] "After practice one night some players noticed Pete light up a cigaret. [...] One of his ends drew Pete aside and said in a fatherly voice, 'You shouldn't smoke, coach; I didn't do it when I was your age." [...] Oregon State had an overall record of 14â€“15 in Elliott's three years as an assistant coach.|$|E

500|$|After his {{appearances}} in London Solti went to Switzerland {{to seek out}} Toscanini, who was conducting in Lucerne. Solti hoped that Toscanini would help find him a post in the US. He was unable to do so, but Solti found work and security in Switzerland as vocal coach to the tenor Max Hirzel, who was learning the role of Tristan in Wagner's opera. Throughout the Second World War, Solti remained in Switzerland. He did not see his father again: Mor Stern died of diabetes in a Budapest hospital in 1943. Solti was reunited {{with his mother and}} sister after the war. In Switzerland he could not obtain a work permit as a conductor, but earned his living as a piano teacher. After he won the 1942 Geneva International Piano Competition he was permitted to give piano recitals, but was still not allowed to conduct. During his exile, he met Hedwig (Hedi) Oeschli, daughter of a lecturer at ZÃ¼rich University. They married in 1946. In his memoirs he wrote of her, [...] "She was very elegant and sophisticated. ... Hedi gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> grace and taught me good mannersâ€“ although she never completely succeeded in this. She also helped me enormously in my career".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Lisa Respers France of CNN felt that [...] "Laryngitis" [...] highlighted a trend of Glee storylines becoming progressively sadder, rather than comedic. She {{wrote that the}} plotlines came across as lecturing, and concluded: [...] "I still heart Glee, which is clearly {{one of the best}} shows on television right now. I just think they may want to lighten the life lessons a bit or spread them out more over several episodes rather than clobbering us all at once." [...] Henrik Batallones of BuddyTV wrote that he was uncertain what to make of the episode, noting: [...] "Sure, there were some high points, and it was a pretty enjoyable watch, but unlike the last few episodes this one left <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> high and dry." [...] Batallones observed that the Sean storyline felt [...] "totally forced into the episode, making Rachel's epiphany [...] very forced and unnatural." [...] Entertainment Weekly Darren Franich was also troubled by the storyline, noting: [...] "It seems like the height of vanity to basically use this storyline to teach Rachel an important lesson about being herself. [...] Glee has used disabled actors before, and I think it's worth debating whether the show honors that or uses it shamelessly." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} {{set to be}} on Drake's debut album, Thank Me Later, but after Drake forwent the song, he insisted that Songz include it on Ready. Songz stated in an interview what fan reception to the track mostly had been that he should put a verse in on [...] "Successful", but Songz told BallerStatus, [...] "I was like, 'That's my homie's song.' Then initially, Drake {{came up to me}} with the idea like 'Nah dog. That's your song. I'm not putting it on my album. So it's going to be a waste. So it's {{going to be a big}} record with no one to go retrieve it.' So we put the verse on there just to give <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more presence on the record for it to be on my album." [...] In an interview with MTV News, Drake explained how the song came about, stating, [...] "It has this pocket, and there was no melody yet. I remember [...] kind of making the joint, and then he hit this sound, which is the chords that are in there. It was so eerie. Like it was haunting, almost. I was like, 'Yo, that's it. You need to use that.' He started playing this patch, and just every note that he played fell into place. I had this beat sitting here that I love so much, and I didn't know what to do with it..." ...|$|E
