5|$|MD36 {{passes through}} the Georges Creek Valley, which {{has a long history}} of coal mining. In {{recognition}} of this, the MDSHA has designated MD36 as part of the Coal Heritage Scenic Byway. Coal mining was a major industry in western Maryland in the 19th century, with railroads being the major route connecting the coal mines to markets outside the Georges Creek Valley. Deep mining, which was the primary <b>mining</b> <b>method</b> used in western Maryland, declined in use after World WarII, replaced primarily by surface mining. Although Maryland coal production is now only a small fraction of total U.S. coal production, coal from the Georges Creek Valley is used to power the AES Warrior Run power plant in Cumberland.|$|E
25|$|Surface {{mining and}} deep {{underground}} mining {{are the two}} basic methods of mining. The choice of <b>mining</b> <b>method</b> depends primarily on depth, density, overburden and thickness of the coal seam; seams relatively close to the surface, at depths less than approximately , are usually surface mined.|$|E

25|$|As {{with other}} types of hard rock mining there are several methods of extraction. In 2012, the {{percentage}} of the mined uranium produced by each <b>mining</b> <b>method</b> was: in-situ leach (44.9 percent), underground mining (26.2 percent), open pit (19.9 percent), and heap leaching (1.7 percent).

25|$|The {{deposits}} of coal in Sulukta mainly consist of lignite or brown coal. From a petrogprahic point of view, the coal of Sulukta contains fusain and clarain. Historically, Sulukta's coal was extracted using both surface and underground mining methods. Currently, it is extracted using only the underground <b>mining</b> <b>method,</b> {{as there is}} no longer any surface mining equipment in the town. Private mines have replaced almost all of the large-scale, state-owned mines of the Soviet period.|$|E
25|$|Efficient mining. The {{extraction}} process of thorium from the earth's crust {{is a much}} safer and efficient <b>mining</b> <b>method</b> than that of uranium. Thorium’s ore, monazite, generally contains higher concentrations of thorium than the percentage of uranium found in its respective ore. This makes thorium a more cost efficient and less environmentally damaging fuel source. Thorium mining is also easier and less dangerous than uranium mining, as the mine is an open pit, which doesn't require ventilation such as the underground uranium mines, where radon levels are potentially harmful.|$|E

25|$|When coal seams {{are near}} the surface, it may be {{economical}} to extract the coal using open cut (also referred to as open cast, open pit, mountaintop removal or strip) mining methods. Open cast coal mining recovers {{a greater proportion of}} the coal deposit than underground methods, as more of the coal seams in the strata may be exploited. This equipment can include the following: Draglines which operate by removing the overburden, power shovels, large trucks in which transport overburden and coal, bucket wheel excavators, and conveyors. In this <b>mining</b> <b>method,</b> explosives are first used in order to break through the surface or overburden, of the mining area. The overburden is then removed by draglines or by shovel and truck. Once the coal seam is exposed, it is drilled, fractured and thoroughly mined in strips. The coal is then loaded onto large trucks or conveyors for transport to either the coal preparation plant or directly to where it will be used.|$|E

40|$|Intrusion {{detection}} systems help network administrators {{prepare for}} {{and deal with}} network security attacks. These systems collect information {{from a variety of}} systems and network sources, and analyze them for signs of intrusion and misuse. A variety of techniques have been employed for analysis ranging from traditional statistical methods to new data mining approaches. In this study the performance of three data <b>mining</b> <b>methods</b> in detecting network intrusion is examined. An experimental design is created to evaluate the impact of three data <b>mining</b> <b>methods,</b> two data representation formats, and two data proportion schemes on the classification accuracy of intrusion detection systems. The results indicate that data <b>mining</b> <b>methods</b> and data proportion {{have a significant impact on}} classification accuracy.

40|$|Air traffic service {{providers}} {{have to make}} decisions regarding changes to air traffic flow in the event of major weather disturbances and traffic congestions to maintain safety of the system. The behavior of the air traffic management system will be more predictable if consistent decisions are made under similar traffic and weather conditions. Consistency of deciding on control action depends on the weather and traffic conditions as well as accuracy in predicting these conditions. Weather parameters (defined in terms of forecast and actual weather and traffic conditions) on different days can be used to categorize these into days with little decision consistency, days with moderate decision consistency and days with high decision consistency. Five years of traffic, weather and ground delay program decisions data at major airports in the United States are used in the analysis. This paper examines performance of different data <b>mining</b> <b>methods</b> in the three regions of decision consistency. Not surprisingly, data <b>mining</b> <b>methods</b> have the best performance in the region of most decision consistency and have the poorest performance in the region of little decision consistency. In applications where data <b>mining</b> <b>methods</b> have differing performance in differing regions, it would be more useful to characterize region specific performance instead of characterizing performance by a single parameter. Finally, the results show no significant variation in the performance of different data <b>mining</b> <b>methods</b> for this particular problem. The fact that different <b>mining</b> <b>methods</b> show no significant variation also provides further confidence in the results of data <b>mining</b> <b>methods.</b> This paper also discusses how prediction errors impact regions of decision consistency.

2500|$|The contour <b>mining</b> <b>method</b> {{consists}} of removing overburden from the seam {{in a pattern}} following the contours along a ridge or around the hillside. This method is most commonly used in areas with rolling to steep terrain. It was once common to deposit the spoil on the downslope side of the bench thus created, but this method of spoil disposal consumed much additional land and created severe landslide and erosion problems. To alleviate these problems, {{a variety of methods}} were devised to use freshly cut overburden to refill mined-out areas. These haul-back or lateral movement methods generally consist of an initial cut with the spoil deposited downslope or at some other site and spoil from the second cut refilling the first. A ridge of undisturbed natural material [...] wide is often intentionally left at {{the outer edge of the}} mined area. This barrier adds stability to the reclaimed slope by preventing spoil from slumping or sliding downhill ...|$|E
