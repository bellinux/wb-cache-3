5|$|As {{the rate}} of cooling is {{increased}} the carbon will have less time to migrate to form carbide at the grain boundaries but will have increasingly large amounts of pearlite of a finer and finer structure within the grains; hence the carbide is more widely dispersed and acts to prevent slip of defects within those grains, resulting in hardening of the steel. At the very high cooling rates produced by quenching, the carbon has no time to migrate but is locked within the face center austenite and forms <b>martensite.</b> <b>Martensite</b> is a highly strained and stressed, supersaturated form of carbon and iron and is exceedingly hard but brittle. Depending on the carbon content, the martensitic phase takes different forms. Below 0.2% carbon, it takes on a ferrite BCC crystal form, but at higher carbon content it takes a body-centered tetragonal (BCT) structure. There is no thermal activation energy for the transformation from austenite to <b>martensite.</b> Moreover, there is no compositional change so the atoms generally retain their same neighbors.|$|E
5|$|<b>Martensite</b> {{has a lower}} density (it expands {{during the}} cooling) than does austenite, so that the {{transformation}} between them results in a change of volume. In this case, expansion occurs. Internal stresses from this expansion generally {{take the form of}} compression on the crystals of <b>martensite</b> and tension on the remaining ferrite, with a fair amount of shear on both constituents. If quenching is done improperly, the internal stresses can cause a part to shatter as it cools. At the very least, they cause internal work hardening and other microscopic imperfections. It is common for quench cracks to form when steel is water quenched, although they may not always be visible.|$|E
5|$|Quenching {{involves}} {{heating the}} steel {{to create the}} austenite phase then quenching it in water or oil. This rapid cooling results in a hard but brittle martensitic structure. The steel is then tempered, {{which is just a}} specialized type of annealing, to reduce brittleness. In this application the annealing (tempering) process transforms some of the <b>martensite</b> into cementite, or spheroidite and hence it reduces the internal stresses and defects. The result is a more ductile and fracture-resistant steel.|$|E
40|$|The {{classification}} of martensitic displacive transformations into athermal, isothermal or anisothermal is discussed. Athermal {{does not mean}} “no temperature dependence ” as is often thought, but is best considered to be short for the notion of no thermal activation. Processes with no thermal activation do not depend on time, {{as there is no}} need to wait for sufficient statistical fluctuations in some specific order parameter to overcome an activation barrier to initiate the process. Clearly, this kind of process contrasts with those that are thermally activated. In the literature, thermally activated <b>martensites</b> are usually termed isothermal <b>martensites,</b> suggesting a constant temperature.

5|$|To inhibit corrosion, {{at least}} 11% {{chromium}} {{is added to}} steel so that a hard oxide forms on the metal surface; {{this is known as}} stainless steel. Tungsten slows the formation of cementite, keeping carbon in the iron matrix and allowing <b>martensite</b> to preferentially form at slower quench rates, resulting in high speed steel. On the other hand, sulfur, nitrogen, and phosphorus are considered contaminants that make steel more brittle and are removed from the steel melt during processing.|$|E
5|$|Recent Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) {{regulations}} have {{given rise to}} a new variety of steel known as Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS). This material is both strong and ductile so that vehicle structures can maintain their current safety levels while using less material. There are several commercially available grades of AHSS, such as dual-phase steel, which is heat treated to contain both a ferritic and martensitic microstructure to produce a formable, high strength steel. Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) steel involves special alloying and heat treatments to stabilize amounts of austenite at room temperature in normally austenite-free low-alloy ferritic steels. By applying strain, the austenite undergoes a phase transition to <b>martensite</b> without the addition of heat. Twinning Induced Plasticity (TWIP) steel uses a specific type of strain to increase the effectiveness of work hardening on the alloy.|$|E
25|$|At this stage, {{it is only}} {{slightly}} curved or may have no curve at all. The katanas gentle curvature is attained by a process of differential hardening or differential quenching: the smith coats the blade with several layers of a wet clay slurry, which is a special concoction unique to each sword maker, but generally composed of clay, water and any or none of ash, grinding stone powder, or rust. This process is called tsuchioki. The edge of the blade is coated with a thinner layer than the sides and spine of the sword, heated, and then quenched in water (few sword makers use oil to quench the blade). The slurry causes only the blade's edge to be hardened and also causes the blade to curve due to the difference in densities of the micro-structures in the steel. When steel with a carbon content of 0.7% is heated beyond 750°C, it enters the austenite phase. When austenite is cooled very suddenly by quenching in water, the structure changes into <b>martensite,</b> {{which is a very}} hard form of steel. When austenite is allowed to cool slowly, its structure changes into a mixture of ferrite and pearlite which is softer than <b>martensite.</b> This process also creates the distinct line down the sides of the blade called the hamon, which is made distinct by polishing. Each hamon and each smith's style of hamon is distinct.|$|E

500|$|... "White" [...] {{cast irons}} contain their carbon {{in the form}} of cementite, or iron carbide (Fe3C). This hard, brittle {{compound}} dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken iron-carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation. Cooling a mixture of iron with 0.8% carbon slowly below 723°C to room temperature results in separate, alternating layers of cementite and ferrite, which is soft and malleable and is called pearlite for its appearance. Rapid cooling, on the other hand, does not allow time for this separation and creates hard and brittle <b>martensite.</b> The steel can then be tempered by reheating to a temperature in between, changing the proportions of pearlite and <b>martensite.</b> The end product below 0.8% carbon content is a pearlite-ferrite mixture, and that above 0.8% carbon content is a pearlite-cementite mixture.|$|E
500|$|For GTAW {{of carbon}} and {{stainless}} steels, {{the selection of}} a filler material is important to prevent excessive porosity. Oxides on the filler material and workpieces must be removed before welding to prevent contamination, and immediately prior to welding, alcohol or acetone should be used to clean the surface. Preheating is generally not necessary for mild steels less than one inch thick, but low alloy steels may require preheating to slow the cooling process and prevent the formation of <b>martensite</b> in the heat-affected zone. [...] Tool steels should also be preheated to prevent cracking in the heat-affected zone. Austenitic stainless steels do not require preheating, but martensitic and ferritic chromium stainless steels do. A DCEN power source is normally used, and thoriated electrodes, tapered to a sharp point, are recommended.

The damping behavior of specimens with different volumetric fractions of <b>martensites</b> was studied in an inverted torsion pendulum in the 40 °C to 400 °C range. The ε- and α′-martensites reversion was observed in the temperature range of 50 °C 200 °C and 500 °C 800 °C, respectively, by dilatometry. Internal friction curves in function of temperature of the deformed samples presented internal friction peaks. The first internal friction peak is related to sum of the amount of ε- and α′-martensites. For low deformations it aligns around 130 °C and it is related only to the ε → γ reverse transformation. The peak situated around 350 °C increases with the specimen degree of deformation and is, probably, related to the presence of α′/γ interfaces, and deformed austenite. Copyright © 2010 T. F. A.
