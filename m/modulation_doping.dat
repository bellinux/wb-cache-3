In addition to confined energy subbands, the unconfined states can be calculated as well. Examples on realistic device structures are given to demonstrate capabilities of this procedure. The numerical results are in good agreement with experiments. With the aid of this method the transitions involving both the confined and unconfined conduction subbands in a <b>modulation</b> <b>doped</b> AlGaAs/GaAs superlattice, and in a strained layer InGaAs/GaAs superlattice are identified.

50|$|A {{separate}} {{class of}} heterostructures that can host 2DEGs are oxides. Although {{both sides of}} the heterostructure are insulators, the 2DEG at the interface may arise even without doping (which is the usual approach in semiconductors). Typical example is a ZnO/ZnMgO heterostructure. More examples {{can be found in a}} recent review including a notable discovery of 2004, a 2DEG at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface which becomes superconducting at low temperatures. The origin of this 2DEG is still unknown, but it may be similar to <b>modulation</b> <b>doping</b> in semiconductors, with electric-field-induced oxygen vacancies acting as the dopants.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps as {{important}} as the work for which he won the Nobel prize is his invention of <b>modulation</b> <b>doping,</b> a method for making extremely high mobility two dimensional electron systems in semiconductors. This enabled the later observation of the fractional quantum Hall effect, which was discovered by Störmer and Tsui in October 1981 in an experiment carried out in the Francis Bitter High Magnetic Field Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Within a year of the experimental discovery, Robert Laughlin was able to explain its results. Störmer, Tsui and Laughlin were jointly awarded the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work.|$|E

50|$|It is {{important}} to point out that of all his contributions Raphael (Ray) Tsu’s most important impact has been in the invention of spatially modulated or periodically layered materials - the superlattice structures; during the late twentieth century and the superlattice scheme remains a highly productive innovation well into this century. Indeed, Ray Tsu played a pivotal role in the creation, invention and development of synthetic periodic superlattices materials/devices, these artificially fabricated 2-dimensional multiple-quantum well structures while working in Leo Esaki’s Exploratory Device Research Group in the IBM Watson Laboratories. Tsu introduced the idea of alternating layers of A/B with the correct band-edge off set. While at IBM, Ray worked closely with another notable scientist, the late L. L. Chang. Ray’s theoretical analysis at IBM led to the important concept of <b>modulation</b> <b>doping</b> for carrier mobility enhancement independently of and prior to the work of Dingle, et al. at Bell Labs.|$|E
50|$|It is important, and challenging, to {{distinguish}} polaritonic lasing from conventional (photonic) lasing, {{owing to the}} similar emission characteristics. A crucial element of the success by both teams lies in the hybrid nature of polaritons whose matter component (excitons) exhibits a sensitive response to an external magnetic field. The Michigan team led by Pallab Bhattacharya used a combination of <b>modulation</b> <b>doping</b> of the quantum wells in the active region, to enhance polariton-electron scattering, and an external magnetic field to enhance the polariton-phonon scattering and the exciton -polariton saturation density. With these measures they achieved a comparably low polariton lasing threshold of 12 A/cm2 (published in Physical Review Letters in May 2013). The investigations performed by the team in Würzburg, having started {{with the idea of}} engineering an electrical device in 2007, led to the desired effect after a few years in cooperation with their international partners from the U.S., Japan, Russia, Singapore, Iceland and Germany. Finally, their studies were complemented by a crucial experiment in a magnetic field: an unambiguous verification of the emission-mode's matter component in the polaritonic laser regime was given, yielding a first-time experimental demonstration of an electrically pumped polariton laser by C. Schneider, A. Rahimi-Iman and co-authors in the team of S. Höfling (published in Nature in May 2013).|$|E

Effective masses obtained from the temperature dependence of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations have a value of (0. 27 +/- 0. 02) m(0) compared to (0. 23 +/- 0. 02) m(0) for quantum wells on Si(100) while the cyclotron resonance effective masses obtained at higher magnetic fields without consideration for nonparabolicity effects have values between 0. 25 and 0. 29 m(0). Ratios of the transport and quantum lifetimes, tau/tau(q) = 2. 13 +/- 0. 10, were obtained for the SOI material that are, we believe, the highest reported for any pseudomorphic SiGe <b>modulation</b> <b>doped</b> structure and demonstrates that there is less interface roughness or charge scattering in the SOI material than in metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors or other pseudomorphic SiGe <b>modulation</b> <b>doped</b> quantum wells.

Introducing Be acceptors into the Ga(1 -y) Al(y) As barriers {{leads to an}} increase of the Curie temperature T_C of Ga(1 -x) Mn(x) As, from 70 K in undoped structures to over 100 K with the <b>modulation</b> <b>doping.</b> This increase is qualitatively consistent with a multi-band mean field theory simulation of carrier-mediated ferromagnetism. An important feature is that the increase of T_C occurs only in those structures where the <b>modulation</b> <b>doping</b> is introduced after the deposition of the magnetic layer, but not when the Be-doped layer is grown first.

40|$|Considering {{scattering}} by unintentional background charged impurities and by charged dopants in the <b>modulation</b> <b>doping</b> layer {{as well as}} by GaAs acoustic phonons, we theoretically {{consider the}} practical intrinsic (phonons) and extrinsic (background and dopants) limits to carrier mobility in modulation doped AlGaAs-GaAs 2 D semiconductor structures. We find that reducing background impurity density to 10 ^ 12 cm^- 3 along with a <b>modulation</b> <b>doping</b> separation of 1000 Å or above will achieve a mobility of 100 × 10 ^ 6 cm^ 2 /Vs at a carrier density of 3 × 10 ^ 11 cm^- 2 for T= 1 K. At T= 4 (10) K, however, the hard limit to the 2 D mobility would be set by acoustic phonon scattering with the maximum intrinsic mobility being no higher than 22 (5) × 10 ^ 6 cm^ 2 /Vs. Detailed numerical results are presented as a function of carrier density, <b>modulation</b> <b>doping</b> distance, and temperature to provide a quantitative guide to experimental efforts for achieving ultra-high 2 D mobilities.

Group III-V nanowires show great promise as elements of high-speed optoelectronic devices, but for such applications {{it is important that}} the electron mobility is not compromised by the inclusion of dopants. Here we show that GaAs nanowires can be n-type doped with negligible loss of electron mobility. Molecular beam epitaxy was used to fabricate modulation-doped GaAs nanowires with Al 0. 33 Ga 0. 67 As shells that contained a layer of Si dopants. We identify the presence of the doped layer from a high-angle annular dark field scanning electron microscopy cross-section image. The doping density, carrier mobility, and charge carrier lifetimes of these n-type nanowires and nominally undoped reference samples were determined using the noncontact method of optical pump terahertz probe spectroscopy. An n-type extrinsic carrier concentration of 1. 10 ± 0. 06 × 10 (16) cm(- 3) was extracted, demonstrating the effectiveness of <b>modulation</b> <b>doping</b> in GaAs nanowires. The room-temperature electron mobility was also found to be high at 2200 ± 300 cm(2) V(- 1) s(- 1) and importantly minimal degradation was observed compared with undoped reference nanowires at similar electron densities.

To overcome the poor morphology inherent to Si p-type (110) growth, heterostructures are fabricated with only the <b>modulation</b> <b>doping</b> layer grown under p-type conditions. Such heterostructures show a hole mobility of 1. 75 x 10 ^ 2 cm^ 2 /Vs at density p= 2. 4 x 10 ^ 11 cm^- 2.

Nanoscale silicon is omnipresent in fundamental research (quantum dots, nanowires) but also approached in future technology nodes of the microelectronics industry.

The sensitivity of the sample to light exposure was measured over several orders of incident powers from ∼ 1 fW to 10 nW and found to increase with power.
