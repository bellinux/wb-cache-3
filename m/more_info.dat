Sections of the Great Wall had been built prior to the Qin Dynasty (221–207BC) and subsequently connected and fortified during the Qin dynasty, although its present form was mostly an engineering feat and remodeling of the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644AD) during the 15th and 16th centuries. The large walls of Pingyao serve as one example. Likewise, {{the walls of the}} Forbidden City in Beijing were established in the early 15th century by the Yongle Emperor.|$|E

2500|$|Bernoulli's {{principle}} {{can be used}} {{to calculate}} the lift force on an airfoil, if the behaviour of the fluid flow {{in the vicinity of the}} foil is known. [...] For example, if the air flowing past the top surface of an aircraft wing is moving faster than the air flowing past the bottom surface, then Bernoulli's principle implies that the pressure on the surfaces of the wing will be lower above than below. This pressure difference results in an upwards lifting force. Whenever the distribution of speed past the top and bottom surfaces of a wing is known, the lift forces can be calculated (to a good approximation) using Bernoulli's equations – established by Bernoulli over a century before the first man-made wings were used for the purpose of flight. Bernoulli's principle does not explain why the air flows faster past the top of the wing and slower past the underside. See the article on aerodynamic lift for <b>more</b> <b>info.</b>|$|E
2500|$|For {{the general}} field of human speech reproduction, a {{bandwidth}} of 5512Hz {{is sufficient to}} produce excellent results (for voice) using the sampling rate of 11025 and VBR encoding from 44100 (standard) wave files..

2500|$|It {{has been}} said that the first Macaulay of Lewis on record is Dòmhnall Cam, in 1610. However, there appear to be two Macaulays {{recorded}} as witnessing a 1572 record of sasine, following a grant of land to Torcail Conanach Macleod. The document, unknown to Matheson, records the names of [...] "Johanno roy [...] mcLachlayne McOler", and [...] "Murdo mcRorie mcLachlayne". According to Aonghas MacCoinnich, the name McOler would appear to be Macaulay, likely meaning that these were Uig Macaulays. The Lewis traditions, gathered by Thomas in the 19th century, had an Iain Ruadh, as grandfather to the Macaulay hero Dòmhnall Cam (see sections below). However, Dòmhnall Cam is on record in 1610 ("Donald Cam McCoull and Mulcallum McCoull"), and Thomas's traditional genealogy implausibly puts his grandfather in the 1450s. MacCoinnich noted that the traditions noted by Thomas seemed to link the Macaulays of Lewis to Wester Ross and Loch Broom; and although any real connection may have been forgotten by tradition, the Macleod trans-Minch lordship would have made such connection quite possible.
