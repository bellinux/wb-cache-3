In March 2003, Demmel joined <b>Machine</b> <b>Head</b> as a full-time guitarist and started writing with the band. By June 2003, <b>Machine</b> <b>Head</b> entered a studio with Flynn producing. On October 27, 2003, <b>Machine</b> <b>Head</b> released Through the Ashes of Empires in Europe.|$|E

5000|$|The {{positioning}} of the <b>machine</b> <b>heads.</b> The Bich had a conventional six-string head for tuning the principal strings, with the four extra strings tuned by <b>machine</b> <b>heads</b> positioned in the body, past the tailpiece. This helped determine the radical shape of the body, and countered the tendency of coursed electric guitars to be head-heavy owing to {{the weight of the}} extra <b>machine</b> <b>heads.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1963 Rickenbacker {{developed}} an electric twelve-string guitar with an innovative headstock design that enabled all twelve <b>machine</b> <b>heads</b> to be fitted onto a standard-length headstock by alternately mounting pairs of <b>machine</b> <b>heads</b> at right-angles to the other.|$|R
5|$|<b>Machine</b> <b>Head</b> {{was formed}} when Flynn felt musically {{unfulfilled}} with his bands Forbidden and Vio-lence and requested {{to start a}} side project. When his request was denied, he left the band and formed <b>Machine</b> <b>Head</b> in 1991 with Duce, Logan Mader and Tony Constanza. The band's first album, Burn My Eyes, was a big success in Europe where it garnered attention on MTV's Headbangers Ball.

5|$|After {{the release}} of Unto the Locust, <b>Machine</b> <b>Head</b> began its Eight Plague Tour and during the first European leg, the band was {{supported}} by Bring Me the Horizon, DevilDriver and Darkest Hour.

Once the tour for the album had been completed, <b>Machine</b> <b>Head</b> and Roadrunner Records {{mutually}} decided to sever ties with regards to distribution in North America and around the world, however to fill the ties, the band released Hellalive (also mixed by Colin Richardson) which was a recording of a Brixton Academy, London set.|$|E

40|$|Process for the {{programming}} of {{numerically controlled machine}} tools, in particular for machining materials by means of laser radiation, by which a <b>machining</b> <b>head</b> (10) of the machine is placed manually at discrete machining or support points (N<-x), by which an adjustment of the correct distance (F) of the <b>machining</b> <b>head</b> for <b>machining</b> is performed {{in relation to the}} normal (15) of the workpiece surface (19) at all support points (N<-x), and by which the coordinates (K<-i) of the <b>machining</b> <b>head</b> (10) are stored for the workpiece machining in allocation to the support points (N<-x). In order to reduce programming time and prevent programming errors, the process takes place by first moving to all the support points (N<-x) manually in succession and then storing each of the coordinates (K<-i), following which the relevant parameters for distance and for inclination adjustment are stored, and an automatic distance and inclination measurement takes place at all the support points (N<-x), follo wing which the coordinates (K<-i) of the <b>machining</b> <b>head</b> (10) are stored as the adjustment values for machining workpieces...|$|R

40|$|Main {{objective}} of the work was to estimate the possibilities {{and the limits of}} elementary stress and strain analysis of the construction. At the beginning it was necessary to simplify the problem to the 1 -D bar problem. The calculation was performed for three typical loading cases, namely for the middle and the border position of the <b>machining</b> <b>head.</b> The contact forces and momentums and the displacements at the <b>machining</b> <b>head</b> have been calculated. The obtained results were then used for the stiffness evaluation of the construction at the <b>machining</b> <b>head.</b> The strength analysis of the moving parts of the machinig center has been done, too. Modern software products (Autodesk Inventor, ProENGINEER, ANSYS Workbench, Maple, Mathcad, etc.) were used for the calculation. The results were compared with The Finite Element Method results...|$|R

40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines {{seeks to}} {{increase}} safety and efficiency in U. S. coal mines. One {{approach is to}} develop technology for automation of a continuous mining machine. Realization of an autonomous mining machine requires development of subsystems for machine intelligence, navigation-positioning, and computer control. This report focuses on investigation of one subsystem, an onboard heading system, which {{would be responsible for}} determining and controlling <b>machine</b> <b>heading.</b> The onboard heading system investigated is a multisensor system to determine <b>machine</b> <b>heading,</b> pitch, and roll. A directional gyroscope provides heading (yaw), fluxgate sensors provide a compass heading, and gravity-referenced clinometers give machine pitch and roll. The system utilizes a dedicated microcontroller networked to an external system of computers. Tram commands, supplied to the network from external computers, are executed by the onboard system. Sensor feedback is employed for closed-loop control of <b>machine</b> <b>heading</b> by controlling pivots and turns. The report discusses operating limitations and error sources of system sensors and presents test results of closed-loop control of <b>machine</b> <b>heading.</b> Results of tests with a mining machine are used to exhibit various sensor shortcomings and to evaluate control of pivots and turns...|$|R
