40|$|The {{feasibility}} of biodiesel production from soapstock containing {{high water content}} and fatty matters by a solid acid catalyst was investigated. Soapstock was converted to high-acid acid oil (HAAO) by the hydrolysis by KOH and the acidulation by sulfuric acid. The acid value of soapstock-HAAO increased to 199. 1 mg KOH/g but {{a large amount of}} potassium sulfate was produced. To resolve the formation of potassium sulfate, acid oil was extracted from soapstock and was converted to HAAO by using sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS). The <b>maximum</b> <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> of acid oil-HAAO was 194. 2 mg KOH/g when the mass ratio of acid oil, sulfuric acid, and water was 10 : 4 : 10 at 2 % of SDBS.

30|$|Air {{exposure}} {{enhances the}} degradation of methyl esters. During the oxidation process of methyl esters, it usually forms a radical next to double bond which quickly binds with oxygen in air [23]. This forms peroxide, which immediately forms new radical, and thus, the process of radical auto-oxidation cycle starts which exponentially increases {{the degradation of}} methyl esters. Figure  1 c shows the change in <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> of the JME sample stored in exposure to air. At the beginning (0 month), the <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> of JME was around 0.44 mg KOH/g. After 6 months of storage, the <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> increased from 0.44 to 3.9 mg KOH/g for the samples which are kept at 4 °C and exposed to air; whereas, for the sample stored at the same temperature but under sealed condition, increase was not significant, i.e., 0.5 mg KOH/g (Figure  1 b,c). Further extending the storage period over 12 months, the increase in <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> was up to 4.8 mg KOH/g for the sample which was kept in exposure to air; whereas, maximum increase in the <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> was found up to 0.8 mg KOH/g for the sealed sample (Figure  1 b,c). The samples which were kept at 25 °C in exposure to air, the <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> after 6 months of storage was also found to increase from 0.44 to 6.37 mg KOH/g (Figure  1 c). On the other hand, maximum increase in the <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> was up to 1.4 mg KOH/g for air-tight sample (Figure  1 b). Over 12 months of storage, the increase in <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> was up to 14.1 mg KOH/g for air-exposed JME sample and 1.8 mg KOH/g for air-tight sample stored at 25 °C (Figure  1 b,c). On the other hand, the samples that are stored at 35 °C and exposed to air, the <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> after 6 months of storage was found to increase to 9.3 mg KOH/g; whereas, in sealed condition, the maximum increase was up to 4 mg KOH/g (Figure  1 b,c). In this case, also after 12 months of storage, the increase in <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> was up to 20.1 mg KOH/g for air-exposed sample. For the sealed sample, the <b>maximum</b> increase in <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> was up to 6 mg KOH/g (Figure  1 b,c). The results obtained showed that air exposure makes biodiesel more susceptible to degradation.

30|$|To {{study the}} {{influence}} of light on degradation, JME samples were stored in light and {{as well as in}} dark conditions. Figure  1 a shows the change in <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> of the biodiesel samples stored under dark and sealed conditions, whereas Figure  1 b represents <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> change for samples exposed to light and sealed condition. After 6 months of storage, the samples stored at 4 °C under dark and sealed conditions were analyzed for <b>acid</b> <b>value.</b> The <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> of the sample kept in dark condition was found to be increased from 0.44 to 0.46 mg KOH/g. Further extending the storage period over 12 months, the increase in <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> of JME was up to 0.58 mg KOH/g. On the other hand, for the sample stored over a period of 6 months at 4 °C in light and sealed condition, increase in the <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> was measured as 0.44 to 0.50 mg KOH/g. After, 12 months of storage, the <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> further increased up to 0.80 mg KOH/g. In the samples stored at 25 °C over a period of 12 months in sealed and dark condition, significant increase in the <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> (i.e., 0.44 to 1.5 mg KOH/g) was observed. Whereas, in the same sample stored in sealed condition but exposed to light, the <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> after 12 months of extended storage increases from of 0.44 to 1.8 mg KOH/g. The <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> of methyl ester after 12 months of storage which was kept at 35 °C under dark and sealed condition increases from 0.44 to 5.0 mg KOH/g; whereas, in light and sealed condition, the <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> increased from 0.44 to 6.0 mg KOH/g. From this, it is clear that prolonged exposure of light on JME samples fastens the degradation rate compared to the dark condition. This finding was found to be in agreement with the previously published report on degradation of rapeseed biodiesel, where the sample kept in exposure to light showed higher degradation than in dark condition [21].|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of asphalt binder modified with waste cooking oil (WCO) {{is affected by}} the quality of the WCO itself because of the degradation process during frying activity. The quality of WCO can be determined by conducting an <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> test, wherein an increased <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> has caused the decreasing of rheological performance. Therefore, untreated WCO with a high <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> is chemically modified and pre-treated with alkaline catalysts to undergo transesterification. The transesterification of WCO is performed as a pre-treatment to reduce high free fatty acid (FFA) content, which is equivalent to the <b>acid</b> <b>value.</b> The treated WCO sample undergoes a chemical test (<b>acid</b> <b>value),</b> physical test (penetration and softening test), and rheological test through a dynamic shear rheometer (DSR). The rheological {{performance of}} rutting, which is analyzed using DSR, is compared between the untreated and treated WCO to determine any improvement in rutting resistance after chemical modification. Results show that the <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> reduces from 1. 65 mL/g to 0. 54 mL/g after the chemical treatment of WCO.

30|$|The {{influence}} of rubber seed storage {{time on the}} quality of rubber seed oil has been investigated. Long-term seed storage led to an increase in the <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> of the oils in the rubber seeds. A seed pre-treatment procedure (drying at 60  °C for 3  days) was shown to have a positive effect and the extent of <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> development in time was lower than for the non-pretreated samples.

30|$|Thus, {{it can be}} {{concluded}} that the <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> of the RSO in the stored seeds {{is a function of the}} storage time, with longer times leading to higher <b>acid</b> <b>values.</b> In addition, the effect is more pronounced for seeds with a higher initial water content (NPT). As such, a thermal pre-treatment to reduce the moisture content of seeds before storage has a positive effect on the <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> development versus time of the isolated RSO. These findings suggest that water plays a role in the formation of acid components in the seeds. This may be rationalized by considering that the acid species formed upon storage are likely FFA, formed by the hydrolysis of triglycerides, possibly catalyzed by enzymes present in the seeds. As such, a higher water content in the seeds is expected to favor FFA formation. In addition, the rate of FFA formation in the dried seeds may also be reduced due to a (partly) deactivation of the enzymes by the pre-treatment at 60  °C for 3  days. The range of <b>acid</b> <b>values</b> of the RSO for the storage experiments is relatively low (0.5 – 4.2  mg/kg KOH) compared to the <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> reported in the literature for RSO, which varies from 2 to 81.6  mg KOH/g [15].|$|R

The oil seed cakes contain {{a reasonable amount of}} protein, starch, free sugar, reducing sugar, cude fiber, inorganic material and vitamin C. physical properties such as saponification <b>value,</b> <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> iodine value and peroxide value for seed oil were determined. It was found that oil was non edible because <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> was high. Qualitatively analysis of amino acid was studied by paper chromatography...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the anti-o-;(idant (hydroquinone) on the breakdown" voltage of JJalm olein samples was studied. The oil san 1 fles had {{different}} <b>acid</b> <b>values</b> resultirg from the different degrees of neutralization treatment,given. The hydroquinone addition ranged from 0. 23. to 1. 13 weight percent of the oil., The hydroquinone. had {{a positive effect on}} the breakdown voltage of the oil samples. The increase in the breakdown voltage was rapid at low concentrations of the :hydroquinone with the tncr ase tending towards an asymptotic value at higher concentrations. The {{effect of the}} h"ydroquinone on the breakdown voltage was also dependent on the <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> of the oil. Oil samples with lower <b>acid</b> <b>values</b> had sharper increases in their breakd. own voltages [...] Percentage increase in the brea't<down voltage of 6 p. 67 (vis-a-vis the additive less samples). was rec rded for oil sample of <b>acid</b> • <b>value</b> of 1. 515 mg KOH/tj oil and containing 0. 45...|$|R
40|$|Sphaerophorus necrophorus {{was grown}} in Medium 156 at 40 pH values ranging from 4. 93 to 9. 46. Growth {{occurred}} between pH 5. 30 and 9. 28. The optimum pH for maximum growth was 6. 84 while the optimum pH for acid production was 7. 70. At pH 7. 70 acid production {{was more than}} double that at pH 6. 84 during a 12 hour incubation period. Thus, maximum growth occurs at one pH and <b>maximum</b> <b>acid</b> producation at another. Since the two optima are different, acid production should be evaluated only when: 1. an optimum medium is employed, 2. the optimum pH for acid production is employed. 3. the incubation period necessary for <b>maximum</b> <b>acid</b> production has elapsed before the test is conducted...|$|R
40|$|Oil {{palm fruit}} waste (OPFW) was {{conducted}} using polyhydric alcohol (PA) as liquefaction solvent with H 2 SO 4 {{in three different}} OPFW/PA ratio (1 / 2, 1 / 3 and 1 / 4). During the liquefaction, cellulose, semi-cellulose and lignin are decomposed, which results in changes of <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> and hydroxyl value. The liquefied OPFW were characterized by Fourier Transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The hydroxyl and <b>acid</b> <b>values</b> of the liquefied oil palm fruit waste (OPFW) varied with the liquefied conditions. It was observed that {{with an increase in}} the liquefaction solvent (PA) amount in the mixture resulted in a high <b>acid</b> <b>value</b> and hydroxyl value for the OPFW. FT-IR spectroscopy analysis showed that the resulting biopolyol was suitable monomer for polyurethane (PU) synthesis for the production of PU foams...|$|R
