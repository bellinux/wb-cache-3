40|$|Abstract: Integrating {{molecular}} marker {{technologies such as}} MAS into breeding strategies could become increasingly important in the coming years, to realize genetic gains with greater speed and precision. The promise of MAS for improving polygenic traits in a quick time-frame and in a cost-effective manner is still elusive. There is a wider appreciation that simply demonstrating that a complex trait can be dissected into QTLs and mapped to approximate genomic locations using DNA markers would not serve {{the ultimate goal of}} trait improvement. In facing the challenge of improving several lines for quantitative traits, MAS strategies use DNA markers in one key selection step to maximize their impact. The present paper discusses the basic requirements and the potential applications of MAS in crop plants, recent developments in MAS strategies and genotyping techniques and the significance of integrating MAS into conventional <b>plant</b> <b>breeding</b> programmes.

40|$|Background Molecular marker-assisted {{breeding}} {{provides an}} efficient tool to develop improved crop varieties. A major {{challenge for the}} broad application of markers in marker-assisted selection is that the marker phenotypes must match plant phenotypes {{in a wide range}} of breeding germplasm. In this study, we used the legume crop species Lupinus angustifolius (lupin) to demonstrate the utility of whole genome sequencing and re-sequencing on the development of diagnostic markers for <b>molecular</b> <b>plant</b> <b>breeding.</b> Results Nine lupin cultivars released in Australia from 1973 to 2007 were subjected to whole genome re-sequencing. The re-sequencing data together with the reference genome sequence data were used in marker development, which revealed 180, 596 to 795, 735 SNP markers from pairwise comparisons among the cultivars. A total of 207, 887 markers were anchored on the lupin genetic linkage map. Marker mining obtained an average of 387 SNP markers and 87 InDel markers for each of the 24 genome sequence assembly scaffolds bearing markers linked to 11 genes of agronomic interest. Using the R gene PhtjR conferring resistance to phomopsis stem blight disease as a test case, we discovered 17 candidate diagnostic markers by genotyping and selecting markers on a genetic linkage map. A further 243 candidate diagnostic markers were discovered by marker mining on a scaffold bearing non-diagnostic markers linked to the PhtjR gene. Nine out from the ten tested candidate diagnostic markers were confirmed as truly diagnostic on a broad range of commercial cultivars. Markers developed using these strategies meet the requirements for broad application in <b>molecular</b> <b>plant</b> <b>breeding.</b> Conclusions We demonstrated that low-cost genome sequencing and re-sequencing data were sufficient and very effective in the development of diagnostic markers for marker-assisted selection. The strategies used in this study may be applied to any trait or plant species. Whole genome sequencing and re-sequencing provides a powerful tool to overcome current limitations in <b>molecular</b> <b>plant</b> <b>breeding,</b> which will enable plant breeders to precisely pyramid favourable genes to develop super crop varieties to meet future food demands...|$|E

There is a projected need to double food production by 2050. In recent times, the trend has been for incremental modest yield increases for most crops.
