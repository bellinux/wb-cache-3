Barely a month after its discovery was announced, on 14 April 1930, {{in an article in}} the New York Times, Armin O.

The space environment is the physical vacuum, whose properties are currently still in the formative stage. Gravity is the result of the interaction of the physical vacuum with material bodies which are moving. Gravity explains by the properties of space compression in relation to moving material bodies. Differential equations of motion of the <b>major</b> <b>planets,</b> the Moon and the Sun have been obtained. It should be noted that the system of differential equations does not contain the mass of bodies and force interactions, in addition, the Earth is considered as a spheroid. By numerical integration of the equations of motion coordinates of the Moon, the Sun and <b>major</b> <b>planets</b> osculating elements of the orbits of the inner planets during 1602 – 2193 are computed. The results of calculations are compared with the coordinates and orbital elements determined according to the coordinates and velocities DE 405.

The resulting equations do not contain terms that take into account the non-sphericity of the Earth and the Moon, being a non-relativistic equations. Based on the research the following conclusions are made: obtained differential equations of motion satisfactorily describe the motion of the <b>major</b> <b>planets,</b> of the Moon and Sun on the time interval of 600 years; these equations are much simpler and more accurate then the differential equations that take into account the relativistic effects. ...|$|R
