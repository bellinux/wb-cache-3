5|$|The Great Famine of 1315 began {{a number}} of acute crises in the English agrarian economy. The famine centred on a {{sequence}} of harvest failures in 1315, 1316 and 1321, combined with an outbreak of murrain, a sickness amongst sheep and oxen in 1319–21 and the fatal ergotism, a fungus amongst the remaining stocks of wheat. Many {{people died in the}} ensuing famine, and the peasantry were said to have been forced to eat horses, dogs and cats as well as conducted cannibalism against children, although these last reports are usually considered to be exaggerations. Poaching and encroachment on the royal forests surged, sometimes on a <b>mass</b> <b>scale.</b> Sheep and cattle numbers fell by up to a half, significantly reducing the availability of wool and meat, and food prices almost doubled, with grain prices particularly inflated.

40|$|Intraspecific {{analyses}} {{of the relationship between}} metabolic rate and mass have rarely been considered during complete ontogeny. Spiny lobsters are fascinating candidates to examine metabolic changes during ontogeny because their life cycle includes an extended planktonic, nektonic, and benthic life stages. The effect of body mass on metabolic rates, aerobic scope, and ammonia-N excretion of Sagmariasus verreauxi juveniles were examined to determine energetic demands through juvenile development. Mass-independent routine oxygen consumption increased allometrically during juvenile development with a <b>mass</b> <b>scaling</b> exponent of 0. 83. The <b>mass</b> <b>scaling</b> exponent of active metabolism (0. 81) was reduced compared to standard metabolism (0. 91) of juvenile lobsters. The aerobic scope of juvenile lobsters decreased with larger body mass. To examine if the <b>mass</b> <b>scaling</b> exponent varies with ontogeny, we compared our data with previous measurements made with larvae of the same species. Comparison between <b>mass</b> <b>scaling</b> exponents showed they were higher for phyllosoma (0. 97) compared to juvenile (0. 83) development. Higher scaling exponents for phyllosoma may be attributed to increased growth rates of phyllosoma compared to juveniles, which increase oxygen consumption due to the higher energy cost of growth. The <b>mass</b> <b>scaling</b> exponent for complete ontogeny (0. 91) of S. verreauxi was larger than the commonly cited 0. 67 (1 / 3) and 0. 75 (3 / 4) <b>mass</b> <b>scaling</b> exponents, indicating that species-specific differences can be a large factor affecting allometric relationships of animals...|$|R

I tested these predictions by using phylogenetic independent contrasts from a set of 20 bird species, where flight metabolic rate was measured during laboratory conditions (mainly in wind tunnels). The body <b>mass</b> <b>scaling</b> exponent for P was 0. 90, significantly lower than the predicted 7 / 6.

The body <b>mass</b> <b>scaling</b> of P (scope) ranged between 0. 31 and 0. 51 for three data sets, respectively, and none differed significantly from the prediction of 5 / 12.

40|$|The use of solid-shell {{elements}} in explicit dynamics {{has been so}} far limited by the small critical time step resulting from the small thickness of these {{elements in}} comparison with the in-plane dimensions. To reduce the element highest eigenfrequency in inertia dominated problems, the selective <b>mass</b> <b>scaling</b> approach previously proposed in [G. Cocchetti, M. Pagani and U. Perego, Comp. & Struct. 2013; 127 : 39 - 52. ] for parallelepiped elements is here reformulated for distorted solid-shell elements. The two following objectives are achieved: the critical time step is governed by the smallest element in-plane dimension and not anymore by the thickness; the mass matrix remains diagonal after the selective <b>mass</b> <b>scaling.</b> The proposed approach makes reference to one Gauss point, trilinear brick element, for which the maximum eigenfrequency can be computed analytically. For this element, it is shown that the proposed <b>mass</b> <b>scaling</b> can be interpreted as a geometric thickness scaling, obtaining in this way a simple criterion for the definition of the optimal <b>mass</b> <b>scaling</b> factor. A strategy for the effective computation of the element maximum eigenfrequency is also proposed. The considered <b>mass</b> <b>scaling</b> preserves the element translational inertia, while it modifies the rotational one, leading to errors in the kinetic energy when the motion rotational component is dominant. The error has been rigorously assessed for an individual element, and a simple formula for its estimate has been derived. Numerical tests, both in small and large displacements and rotations, using a state-of-the-art solid-shell element taken from the literature, confirm the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach.
