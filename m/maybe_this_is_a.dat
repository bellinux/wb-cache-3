Kim Jones of About.com noted that [...] "Solid vocals, just enough {{rock and a}} message {{that we can all}} relate to on {{whatever}} level we're currently at - it's not reinventing the wheel but it's still very, very important. That's what you get with Reckless." [...] Laura Chambers of Christian Music Review said that [...] "Without a doubt, Reckless will leave you breathless." [...] Furthermore, Christian Music Zine's Joshua Andre wrote that [...] "While musically Reckless is more aggressive than the previous album We Cry Out, it still however doesn't match the intensity of albums such as Stay and Speaking Louder Than Before. Yet <b>maybe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> good thing. It means that Jeremy is evolving in his sound, and doing music from a place that is not duty or expectations, but of his own heart and his walk with Jesus his songs do still sound as passionate as ever. The result is 11 tracks of brutal honesty, with the heart behind the songs still present." [...] Andre called it [...] "an enjoyable album." [...] Kevin Davis of New Release Tuesday alluded to how [...] "Camp's newest album Reckless has a cohesiveness and spiritual maturity that I can hear in every song." [...] In addition, Davis wrote that the album is [...] "Filled with passionate songs birthed in the furnace of worship, prayer and intercession, Jeremy Camp's new studio album Reckless is a powerful experience calling the body of Christ to a revival and restoration in Christ with eleven brand new original songs." [...] Davis noted that [...] "this album displays a softer adult contemporary musical style. The album is filled with messages of hope, confession and worship to our great God and Savior. Jeremy Camp's enthusiastic and reverent style of writing and singing praise and worship songs has consistently been a draw for me. Camp's prayerful sentiments are consistently filled with his personal adoration of God. Reckless is no exception." [...] Shoji McGhee of ONCOURSE MAGAZINE found that [...] "Thematically Reckless remains true to what Jeremy Camp fans would expect. It is a pop-rock worship album born from Jeremy's personal experiences with God. You will be encouraged and challenged, reminded of God's love and called to act upon that great love." ...|$|E
5000|$|Skilled workmen were housed {{separately}} and received better treatment, including better rations. Survivors record that cruelty was not universal. Iwens reported {{a number of}} instances of kind treatment from, among others, a German airman, who was shocked by the suffering {{of the children in the}} ghetto. His brother (later among the murdered), similarly was well-treated by a German unit where he worked in the kitchen. On another occasion, two German soldiers, aware that the SD was selecting for execution Jews who had no work, pretended they were needed for work with their unit, thus saving, at least for a while, a group of about 30 people. Iwens described the situation from his point of view as a Jew who had been allowed to live as a skilled worker: The Germans protected us because our work was of use to them; it was also true that some felt sorry for us - especially for [...] "their" [...] Jews,' those they had gotten to know personally. Whenever Jews worked for any length of time, with ordinary German soldiers, their relationship often became quite friendly. At 322, Yasha Magid, the 'Oberjude', and Dr. Itzikowitz were much respected by their chief and so was Margaram at our place. The fact that Jews understood the German language, whereas most gentiles did not, was also helpful. But we had no illusions. Sooner or later there would be a direct order and we'd be done away with. [...] Another survivor, Frankel-Zaltzman, described how the last survivors of the ghetto learned from a German soldier that they would not be massacred, as they had feared, on June 26, 1942, which was the one-year anniversary of the fall of Daugavpils: * * * there was suddenly a knock at the window. A soldier came to tell us that we can sleep in peace. * * * [...] "You can believe me and I want you not to give me away when the chief himself will come to tell you this, because I wasn't supposed to come and tell you the good news, but I am not an enemy of the Jews and I see how you are suffering." [...] The soldier went away and we didn't know if we should rejoice because <b>maybe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> trick of the chief's so that we shouldn't run away before daybreak. Finally we decided to believe the soldier because he was always very friendly to us, helped us carry food to our brothers at the fortress and even used to bring a long piece of white bread for the sick. No matter what, the relationship between Jews and Germans remained strange at best: [...] "Regardless of how friendly a German became with a Jew, awareness that one had absolute power over the other made such an association seem unnatural." ...|$|E

40|$|AUTO is a prose {{work about}} poetry and the “growth of the poet’s imagination”, to quote The Poet. A poet? If we {{remember}} correctly. Reference? Is/was that {{how it should}} be worded? <b>Maybe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> mistake? But an error is a textual truth in itself. It tells us something. AUTO. It is also a metatextual work that is concerned with its own means of production. The voice of self shifts position in relation to the construction of narratives. Stories are told, anecdotes conveyed, portraits suggested. The autobiographical voice is as much an onlooker as the centre of activity. AUTO is a text about the nature of memory, about recall and remembering. There are many possible pasts, and the text moves in and out of alternatives constructions. There is repetition and reconsideration – situations and occasions are examined from different angles. Even footnotes become part of the text. Recall is both historic and mythological – truth and fiction struggle to define and declare themselves, or subvert each other. Poetry appears in the text when the moment being considered is remembered as a trigger, or is a specific point in time for a poem being drafted. Every draft is a valid poem – book-published versions are interpolated for the original draft, early drafts replacing the polished end product. End product? There is no closure – memory isn’t that stable. The text might seek validation in “external” information – a quote, a textual reference – it may become “archaeological” in trying to reconstruct a specific environment. But the tension between place and emotion, the creation of poem and “inspiration”, is a constant. There is a prologue – a “before we begin”. But that’s here and now, where “I write”. The text ends where YOU and I write and read. The roles of reader and writer are blurred. Whose story is being told here, who owns the copyright on the poems? The declaration that accompanies this manuscript claims it is John Kinsella – I? “My name is John Kinsella. I make poems. ...|$|E

30|$|Using {{comments}} {{rather than}} explicitly structured information as data source has several advantages. One clear {{advantage is that}} comments are ubiquitous in the Internet. They {{are associated with the}} most varied objects, such as movies, products, personal videos, social media posts, episodes of TV shows, restaurants, touristic attractions, hotels, online news and so on. Also, comments are cheap, i.e., ideally, no one is getting paid to join discussions and share their ideas through online comments. More important, comments are spontaneously generated by people when there is something they judge as useful that should be shared with others. From a rational perspective, if the user who posted the comment thinks she/he is not gaining anything by posting her/his thoughts, she/he would not have made the effort to write and post them. Finally, comments may serve as a natural filter for entities that should be indexed and processed. If an old Youtube video has not received any comment, <b>maybe</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> indicator of low quality. Thus, there is some value associated with each comment, even if it is not clearly stated, and even if many view comment sections as harmful 1. In short, we see comments about a particular entity as crowdsourcing, similar to what is done in the ESP game [3], an online game licensed by Google that is used to improve the accuracy of its image search engine. With this, we expect to generate summaries for entities and domains without anyone ever having to explicitly explain what they are.|$|R
