40|$|Introduction Mother-to-Mother (M 2 M) or “Mentor Mother” {{programmes}} utilise HIV positive {{mothers to}} provide support and advice to HIV positive pregnant women and mothers of HIV exposed babies. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) supported a Mentor Mother programme in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe from 2009 to 2012; with programme beneficiaries observed to have far higher retention at 6 – 8 weeks (99 % vs 50 %, p< 0. 0005) and to have higher adherence to Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) guidelines, compared to those not opting in. In this study we explore how the M 2 M progamme {{may have contributed to}} these findings. Methods In this qualitative study we used thematic analysis of in-depth interviews (n = 79). This study was conducted in 2 urban districts of Bulawayo, Zimbabwe’s second largest city. Results Interviews were completed by 14 mentor mothers, 10 mentor mother family members, 30 beneficiaries (women enrolled both in PMTCT and M 2 M), 10 beneficiary family members, 5 women enrolled in PMTCT but who had declined {{to take part in the}} <b>M</b> 2 <b>M</b> <b>programme</b> and 10 health care staff members. All beneficiaries and health care staff reported that the programme had improved retention and provided rich information on how this was achieved. Additionally respondents described how the programme had helped bring about beneficial behaviour change. Conclusions <b>M</b> 2 <b>M</b> <b>programmes</b> offer great potential to empower communities affected by HIV to catalyse positive behaviour change. Our results illustrate how M 2 M involvement may increase retention in PMTCT programmes. Non-disclosure to one’s partner, as well as some cultural practices prevalent in Zimbabwe appear to be major barriers to participation in <b>M</b> 2 <b>M</b> <b>programmes...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractResidents {{in private}} old age homes (POAHs) usually adopt a {{sedentary}} lifestyle, making them prone to physical deconditioning. This {{study examined the}} effects of a short-term mobility exercise programme on the balance and mobility of elderly residents residing in POAHs in Hong Kong. Subjects recruited from three POAHs were matched in demographic characteristics and ambulatory status before assigning them to either a mobility exercise (<b>M)</b> <b>programme</b> or control (C) programme of general exercise. Both programmes consisted of 18 sessions that were conducted three times a week over two months. The subjects' mobility and balance performance before, mid-term, at completion of the programmes and three months afterward was evaluated using the 4 -metre walk (4 MW) test, timed up-and-go (TUG) test and the Berg Balance Scale (BBS). Ten and eight subjects completed the <b>M</b> and C <b>programmes,</b> respectively. The <b>M</b> group did not demonstrate improvement in 4 MW, TUG or BBS score at completion of the programme. At 3 months after the programme, only the C group experienced a significant decrease in BBS score (p = 0. 02). The short <b>M</b> <b>programme</b> did not significantly improve the mobility and balance performance of elderly residents of POAHs, but the performance appeared to be maintained for three months after the programme stopped.

50|$|The {{expansion}} {{of teacher education}} institutions started from the year 2004-2005 due to the liberal policy of the State Governments and generous outlook of the affiliating Universities. The increase in number of teacher education institutions, particularly in Karnataka, was responsible for diluting the standards of teacher preparation, resulting in low standard in school education. The irony is we have surplus teachers, but they are neither effective nor efficient. Expansion in teacher education institutions {{gave rise to the}} silent demand for teacher-educators. Hence some of the affiliated colleges came forward to start <b>M.Ed.</b> <b>programme,</b> the NCTE gave permission to 7-8 colleges to start and run the M.Ed. courses in addition to the B.Ed. programme. Unfortunately, in these institutions both B.Ed. and M.Ed. programmes are managed below the standard, not matching with the NCTE Norms or Regulations of the University.|$|E
50|$|King Alfred's College trained {{thousands}} of teachers, at first men only, and then women too from 1960 onwards. Following changes in UK government policy towards further {{and higher education}} in the early 1970s, the College looked for partners to merge with and also sought to diversify its provision. Its educational partner, the University of Southampton, was lukewarm about offering other degrees, and the College sought approval for its own BEd and then BA degrees from the Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA). Interdisciplinary degrees in History and English with Drama, Archaeology and American Studies were the first offered. Further programmes followed in the 1980s, but it was only when the college expanded in the early 1990s following CNAA approval for a modular degree programme {{that a large number of}} new fields of study grew at undergraduate level. At the same time Masters programmes were approved alongside an <b>MEd</b> <b>programme.</b> With the CNAA's demise in 1992, the College found itself once again accredited by the University of Southampton, resuming a partnership broken off 18 years earlier.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Micro to Macro (I~ 2 <b>M)</b> <b>Programme</b> {{has been}} focused on {{developing}} under-standing of subsurface fluid flows within geological heterogeneities spanning wide ranges of spatial and temporal scales. This paper highlights the opportunities for industries to incor-porate recent observations and emerging theories in this field towards improved fluid resource management. The background to, and objectives of, the 1 ~ 2 <b>M</b> <b>Programme</b> are reviewed. Selected results from the projects in the programme are discussed and, where possible, compared with evidence from industrial field data. Some conclusions and rec-ommendations for future practice in reservoir characterization are made. For example, there is currently very little recognition of modern theories that point to the likelihood of prevailing criticality in the mechanical state of the Earth's crust and its implication for coherent large-scale collective behaviour emerging from small-scale interactions. Also associated with criticality are long-range spatial correlations and the lik lihood that flow properties change during the life of commercial developments: uch changes, for example, to absolute permeability, should be looked for and analysed for spatial and tem-poral patterns. Allied with these features is the importance ofcoupled processes, principall...|$|R

During the final year of their B.Ed. or <b>M.Ed.</b> <b>programme,</b> pre-service teachers devote two 18 -week-long semesters at a local primary or secondary school. This one-year long internship was initiated under assumption that one semester of student teaching {{may not be enough to}} prepare the new teacher for a lasting career in the field of education. A year-long model may more adequately prepare the new teacher in terms of their self-esteem and experience at tackling the everyday tasks. Even though it seems too long for pre-service teachers working at schools for a yearlong, most of them feel satisfied with this condition. If a teacher graduate from a 5 -year B.Ed. or 2 -year M.Ed. programs with a yearlong internship, he or she will earn higher salary than from other 4 -year bachelor programs.|$|E
