40|$|A novel {{approach}} to control Boophilus microplus is {{to disrupt the}} physiological function of an endogenous myokinin receptor of this tick that was previously cloned in our laboratory. To test the hypothesis that this myokinin receptor might be a suitable target for development of a novel acaricide, this target was validated by immunological disruption. A mixture of peptides, corresponding to the sequence of the extracellular loops of this receptor which were synthesized and linked to a carrier protein, was injected into Hereford cattle to induce an immunological response. Immunological tests (ELISA) were developed to test the sera of these animals for antibody titers. The {{data were analyzed using}} a randomized block split plot design and were compared between the control (calves numbers 407, 408, 427, 436, and 438) and peptide-injected calves (calves numbers 417, 420, 421, 426, and 435). A gradual increase of antibody production was observed with the peptide-injected calves with bleed 4 showing the highest absorbances. Control calves and peptide-injected calves with high antibody titers were challenged with approximately 20, 000 tick larvae at the USDA Cattle Tick Research laboratory. The tick challenge test determined that disruption of the receptor function produces a detrimental effect on tick physiology (development, feeding and reproduction) by looking at percentage of molting, time of survivorship, number of ticks dropped, weight of fed females, weight of egg masses, and blood <b>meal</b> <b>conversion.</b> The results, which were analyzed by a contingency table and a 2 sample T-test, did not support the hypothesis that the sera ingested from the peptide-injected cattle would cause a detrimental effect on tick physiology. There was no statistical significance in the percentage of metanymphs molting from peptide-injected calves versus control calves (p = 0. 282) and in the time of adult survivorship. A statistical inference could be made about the number of ticks that dropped since four calves died of bovine babesiosis after the metanymphal collection. There was no statistical significance in the weight of fed females (p = 0. 061), weight of egg masses (p = 0. 885), and bloodmeal conversion (p = 0. 312) from peptide-injected calves versus control calves...|$|E
40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop a nonrenewable energy and greenhouse gas emissions ecoprofile of thermoplastic protein derived from blood meal (Novatein thermoplastic protein; NTP). This was intended for comparison with other bioplastics as well as identification of hot spots in its cradle-to-gate production. In Part 1 of this study, the effect of allocation on the blood meal used as a raw material was discussed. The objective of Part 2 was to assess the ecoprofile of the thermoplastic conversion process and to compare the cradle-to-gate portion of the polymer's life cycle to other bioplastics. Methods Inventory was collected to aggregate nonrenewable primary energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. Data were collected {{from a variety of sources}} including published papers, reports to government agencies, engineering models and information from a single blood meal production facility. Several assumptions regarding the thermoplastic conversion process were evaluated by way of a sensitivity analysis. Results The allocation procedure chosen for the impacts of farming and meat processing had the greatest effect on results. Excluding farming and meat processing, blood drying had the greatest contribution to nonrenewable energy use and GHGs, followed by the petrochemical plasticizer used. Other assumptions, such as scarcity of water or inclusion of pigments, although significant when considered for blood <b>meal</b> <b>conversion</b> to NTP alone, were found not to be significant when production of blood meal was included in the analysis. Qualitative differences were observed between NTP and other bioplastics. For example, the profiles of some other bio-based polymers were dominated by fermentation and polymer recovery processes. In the case of NTP, it is the production of the raw material used that is most significant, and thermoplastic modification has a relatively low contribution to GHGs and nonrenewable energy use. Conclusions For a truly attributional scenario, production of any ruminant animal products does have an associated GHG. Deriving this for blood meal on a mass-based allocation seems to indicate that NTP is less favorable than other cradle-to-gate bioplastic production systems from a global warming perspective. On the other hand, the motivation for developing the material in the first place was to make use of an existing waste product. If it is assumed that the magnitude of blood meal production is independent of fertilizer or plastics demand and, instead, reflects demand for major products such as meat, further development of NTP is justified...|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} of diabetes {{is very low}} in rural, traditionally living, South African Black people, but higher in the urbanised Black population. One factor, that could {{have contributed to the}} increased prevalence of diabetes, is the change in diet from maize por-ridge to bread. An in vitro method was used to determine the starch digestibility of African maize porridge compared to other cereal foods. Maize porridge had a much lower in vitro starch digestibility than white bread (P< 0. 001). There was a positive cor-relation (P= 0. 05) between rate of starch digestibility of maize porridge and endosperm hardness. Decreasing the particle size of the maize <b>meal</b> by <b>conversion</b> to maize flour did not increase starch digestibility. Both decreasing and increasing the cooking time decreased the starch digestibility. The predicted glycaemic index for maize porridge ranged from 39 to 50 (glucose standard), which suggests that maize porridge may be useful in the dietary management of diabetes. # 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Purpose of this {{research}} was to investigate utilization of labor productivity standards and variables that affect productivity in Texas school foodservice operations. A questionnaire was developed, validated, and pilot tested, then mailed to 200 randomly selected Texas school foodservice directors. Descriptive statistics for variables were calculated. MANOVA and Pearson’s Product Moment correlation were used to test relationships between variables affecting labor productivity. The most common labor standard used was meals per labor hour (MPLH); both MPLH and labor cost as a percentage of revenue (%LABOR) were utilized more frequently in larger size districts. <b>Meal</b> equivalent (ME) <b>conversions</b> were most commonly defined as: 2 breakfasts = ME; $ 2. 00 = ME; and 3 or 4 after-school snacks = ME. There was little consistency in use of labor productivity standards and ME conversions in Texas school foodservice operations, which limits their validity for external benchmarking. However, these standards can be used internally to effectively forecast labor needs, aid decisions about productivity, and hold employees accountable for their time...|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} of defatted soybean meal {{as a substitute}} for fish meal was evaluated in juvenile (450 g on average) yellowtail fed diets containing several levels of soybean meal (from 20 to 50 %). After 153 days, liveweight averages were 980, 925, 795 and 670 g for fish fed diets in which fish meal was partially substituted with 20, 30, 40 and 50 % soybean <b>meal,</b> and feed <b>conversion</b> ratios were 2. 79, 3. 09, 4. 57 and 6. 52, respectively. Regression analysis showed a negative effect of inclusion of soybean, although fish fed diets containing 20 % and 30 % of soybean did not present statistical differences and grew significantly more, and had a better feed conversion ratio, than fish fed 40 or 50 % diets. Likewise, muscle protein level was lower and lipid content was higher in fish fed 20 or 30 % soybean. No differences were obtained for protein digestibility coefficients of experimental diets.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to use the residues of fermented sardine to elaborate the acid fish silage and its use in feed for aquaculture. Biological assay was performed by feeding largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) fingerlings (initial weight 22 g), with extruded diets (41 % crude protein; 3, 600 kcal/kg digestible energy) containing 0. 0, 7. 5, 10. 0, 12. 5, or 15. 0 % of fish silage in partial substitution to the fish <b>meal.</b> The feed <b>conversion</b> ratio and weight gain for the treatments were: 1. 26 and 15. 76 g; 1. 11 and 17. 07 g; 1. 19 and 17. 81 g; 1. 18 and 19. 83 g; 1. 47 and 14. 64 g, respectively. No significant differences (P< 0. 05) were detected among the treatments. Results indicated that it was possible to use up to 15 % of acid fish silage as partial substitute for fish meal in the formulation of carnivorous fish feed...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effect of raw and differently processed (cooked, dehulled and toasted) kidney bean meal on the performance of broiler chicken. Histological examinations of internal organs were also conducted in a feeding trial that lasted for 56 days. Two hundred and twenty?five day old broiler chicks (Anak strain) were used for the study. There were five treatment groups of three replicates of 15 birds per treatment. Raw and processed kidney bean meal was used to replace 50 % protein supplied by soybean in the control diet. Data collected was used to evaluate feed intake, weight gain and efficiency of feed utilization. The weights of liver, pancreas, kidney, heart and lungs were also recorded and tissue samples of each collected for histological examination. Food intake was unaffected by the dietary treatments. Significant (p< 0. 05) differences were obtained in Average Daily Gain (ADG) and efficiency of feed utilization (FCE). ADG in birds fed cooked kidney bean was significantly (p< 0. 05) higher than those fed toasted. ADG was depressed in birds fed raw and dehulled <b>meals.</b> Feed <b>Conversion</b> Efficiency (FCE) followed the same trend as ADG. The relative weight of the pancreas was significantly (p< 0. 05) increased, as a result of acinar hypertrophy. The kidney had severe congestion of glomeruli and distention of the capillary vessels with numerous thrombi in birds fed soaked and decorticated kidney bean meals. The weight of the liver was significantly (p< 0. 05) reduced in birds fed soaked and decorticated beans and it was characterized by marked coagulative necrosis and degeneration of the hepatocytes. The structural alterations were attributed to high concentration of residual anti-nutritional factors in the processed seeds. In conclusion, cooked kidney bean meal can be used to replace 50 % protein supplied by soybean meal in broiler starter and finisher diets without any adverse effect on the performance and the intestinal organs...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate mopane worm (Imbrasia belina) as a protein source in the diet of Oreochromis mossambicus. One thousand five hundred O. mossambicus fingerlings (40  ±  2. 5  g) were fed five isonitrogenous, isolipidic and isoenergetic diets formulated to contain 30 % crude protein and 20  MJ/kggross energy (dry matter basis) for 51  days. Fifteen indoor rectangular concrete tanks (1. 5  m 3) connected to a recirculating system were used. Water temperature ranged between 27 and 29  °C. The diets were prepared by replacing fishmeal with mopane worm meal at 10 %, 20 %, 40 % and 60 %. The diets were coded D 2, D 3, D 4 and D 5 respectively. A control diet with no mopane worm meal was coded D 1. The diets were fed to triplicate groups of O. mossambicus twice a day. Specific growth rate (SGR), Thermal-unit growth coefficient (TGC), protein efficiency ratio (PER) and apparent digestibility coefficient (ADC) increased with higher inclusion levels of mopane worm <b>meal.</b> Feed <b>conversion</b> ratio (FCR) also improved with higher inclusion levels. However, the highest growth performance (SGR: 3. 49 %; FCR: 1. 29) was recorded in fish fed the fishmeal based control diet. Protease, amylase and lipase activities were determined in the intestines. Both protease and amylase activity were significantly higher (P <  0. 05) at high mopane worm inclusion levels. It is suggested that the high protein levels of the mopane worm diet elicited high protease activity. The health status of the fish was evaluated by examining the liver and intestine histology. There were no evident histological alterations of either liver or intestine as mopane worm meal inclusion levels increased. This showed that mopane worm meal may be a good candidate for the replacement of fishmeal in O. mossambicus diets. The highest profit index (1. 67) was recorded in the 60 % mopane worm inclusion level. The lowest profit index was in the control. More studies on mopane worm meal as a substitute of fishmeal are recommended in other fish species...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} canola meal and oil in quail diet on productive performance, egg quality and bone characteristics. Quails (n = 84) with 150 -days-of-age and average weight of 234 ± 17 g were used in this experiment that lasted 84 days. The experiment consisted of a completely randomized design with 4 treatments, 7 replications with 3 birds each. Four diets were formulated: SM+SO - control diet with soybean meal and oil; MC+SO - 25 % replacement of soybean meal with canola meal; MC+CO - 25 % replacement of soybean meal with canola meal and complete replacement of canola oil with soybean oil; SM+OC - control diet with soybean meal and canola oil. Productive performance, internal and external egg quality and bone characteristics were evaluated. The diet with canola meal and oil (MC+CO) decreased (p < 0. 05) feed conversion. Albumen height was lower (p < 0. 05) for treatments with canola meal and oil (MC+CO). Regardless of the oil used, the dietary canola meal (MC+SO and MC+CO) reduced the weight and length of tibia (p < 0. 05), but increased its ash content (p < 0. 05). The mixture of canola oil and <b>meal</b> decreases feed <b>conversion,</b> and negatively affects internal egg quality and bone characteristics of quails. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractProduction {{performance}} {{were measured}} on lambs fed with feed containing grape seed flour; weight gain, feed consumption and slaughtering parameters were recorded. 24 “Gentile di Puglia” lambs {{were divided into}} four homogeneous groups as regards weight; {{from the age of}} 50 days they were fed for a further 63 days on complete feeds in pellet form. The feeds contained 0, 10, 20 or 30 % grape seed flour. The feeds containing this by-product gave productive responses comparable to, or even better than, those obtained without by-product. A content of 10 % grape seed meal in the feed produced weight gains and final live weights greater (P< 0. 05) than those produced by the control feed (261 g/d vs. 222 g/d and 34. 016 kg vs. 31. 533 kg). The use of up to 20 % grape seed <b>meal</b> gave feed <b>conversion</b> indexes similar to those obtained using the control feed. Slaughtering data, pH measurements, dissection data and meat chemical composition were not influenced by the type of feed. Interesting findings were obtained from the fatty acid composition, which showed that increasing levels of inclusion of grape seed flour in the feed decreased saturated fatty acids, increased unsaturated fatty acids and improved dietary characteristics of the meat with the best indices of atherogeniticy and thrombogenicity...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{proteins}} substitutes of fishmeal in aquafeed {{are usually}} lacking in some {{essential amino acids}} and fatty acids. The microalgae Chlorella vulgaris has good-quality protein with amino acids rich in methionine, lysine and alanine. Four novel diets having C. vulgaris as {{the main source of}} protein were produced for African catfish Clarias gariepinus with an initial average weight of 1. 09 ± 0. 05 g. The diets were labeled Feed 1 (F 1) to feed 4 (F 4). The treatment diets were included 25 % (F 1), 15 % (F 2), 5 % (F 3) and 0 % (F 4) green algae meal. The basal ingredients of the feed were corn (maize) included as F 1, 40 %, F 2, 43 %, F 3, 53 % and F 4, 43 %; and millet meal, which varied in F 1 as 23 %, F 2, 30 %, F 3, 30 % and F 4, 30 %. The ingredients were preconditioned at 110 °C and pelleted. Post-fingerling African catfish were stocked at 10 fish per aquarium. There were three replicate aquariums for each feed type and the fish were fed for 60 d. The specific growth rate was best for the catfish fed with 25 % C. vulgaris diet 7. 86 ± 0 % day− 1, and worst at 6. 77 ± 0. 07 % day− 1 for the control group F 4, 0 % algal <b>meal.</b> The food <b>conversion</b> ratio (FCR) was lowest (1. 88 ± 0. 02) for 25 % algal meal diet (F 1) and highest (2. 98 ± 0. 01) for the 0 % algal meal diet F 4. Similarly, catfish had average weight gain of 121. 02 ± 0. 04 g for those fed with F 1 compared to 62. 50 ± 0. 0 g for those fed with 0 % algae F 4. Protein efficiency ratio was highest for the F 1 -fed fish (2. 46 ± 0. 22) and lowest for those fed with F 4 (2. 02 ± 0. 09). The hepatosomatic index was lowest for F 1 -fed fish (1. 48 ± 0. 01) and highest for catfish fed with F 4 (2. 50 ± 0. 59). Based on the results, C. vulgaris is a good protein source for African catfish and can also substitute fishmeal in the catfish diets...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo nesta pesquisa foi avaliar o efeito de dois ingredientes protéicos da dieta (farelo de soja e de algodão) e de dois processamentos físicos do concentrado (farelado e extrusado) na terminação de 16 bovinos machos não-castrados da raça Canchim. Avaliaram-se ainda a excreção de nutrientes nos dejetos e o potencial de produção de biogás. Os animais tinham 12 meses de idade e 315 kg PC, em média, e foram confinados em baias individuais durante 147 dias (os primeiros 35 dias foram de adaptação). Como volumoso utilizou-se silagem de milho, em uma relação volumoso:concentrado de 50 : 50, com base na MS. Os resultados foram analisados em delineamento inteiramente casualizado, em esquema fatorial 2 × 2 (fonte protéica × processamento físico). A fonte protéica influenciou o ganho de peso {{corporal}} (1, 50 e 1, 35 kg/dia para o farelo de soja e de algodão, respectivamente), a conversão alimentar (4, 73 e 5, 31 kg MS ingerida/kg de ganho de peso, respectivamente) e a eficiência protéica (1, 78 e 1, 59 kg de ganho de peso/kg PB ingerida, respectivamente). O tratamento físico do concentrado e a fonte protéica não influenciaram a ingestão de MS, a área de olho-de-lombo e a espessura de gordura, estimadas por ultra-som. O balanço de nutrientes foi semelhante entre tratamentos para MS, FDN e FDA, mas a fonte protéica determinou diferenças no balanço de PB. Entre os macro e microminerais quantificados nas fezes, os teores de P e Mg diferiram entre as fontes protéicas e a extrusão aumentou o conteúdo de Ca, com médias de 0, 39 e 0, 43 g/ 100 g de MS de dejetos, respectivamente, para os concentrados farelado e extrusado. Os dejetos produziram biogás de maneira efetiva entre o 70 º e o 200 º dia. The {{objective of}} this research was to evaluate the effect of two protein ingredients of the diet (soybean and cottonseed meals) and two physical process of the concentrate (grounded and extruded) upon the finishing of 16 Canchim young bulls. It was evaluated also the nutrients excretion in feces and biogas production potential. The animals were 12 month-year-old, with initial 315 kg BW, and they were confined in individual pens for 147 days, being the first 35 days of adaptation. The roughage used was corn silage and the forage:concentrate rate was 50 : 50, on dry matter basis. The results were analyzed in a total randomized design, in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement (protein source x physical process). There was effect of protein source upon the body weight gain (1. 50 and 1. 35 kg/day with soybean and cottonseed <b>meal,</b> respectively), feed <b>conversion</b> (4. 73 and 5. 31 kg DM intake/kg weight gain, respectively) and protein efficiency (1. 78 and 1. 59 kg weight gain/kg CP intake, respectively). There was no difference among treatments for DM, loin eye area and subcutaneous fat thickness, evaluated by ultra-sound. The nutrient balance was similar among treatments for DM, NDF and ADF, but protein source caused differences in CP balance. Among the macro and microminerals determined in feces, P and Mg contents were different among protein sources, and extrusion increased Ca content, with means of 0. 39 and 0. 43 g/ 100 g dejections dry matter, respectively for grounded and extruded concentrate.
