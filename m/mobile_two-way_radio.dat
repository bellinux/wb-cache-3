50|$|In {{many areas}} in the United States, these {{frequencies}} are used for land <b>mobile</b> (<b>two-way)</b> <b>radio</b> communications services in addition to paging. The VHF (152/157-158 MHz) and UHF (454/459 MHz) frequencies are often used for a mixture of paging and land mobile communications. The VHF low band (35/43 MHz) frequencies are mainly used for local hospital paging and in many areas are completely unused.|$|E
50|$|The first truly <b>mobile</b> <b>two-way</b> <b>radio</b> was {{developed}} in Australia in 1923 by Senior Constable Frederick William Downie of the Victorian Police. The Victoria Police were {{the first in the}} world to use wireless communication in cars, putting an end to the inefficient status reports via public telephone boxes which had been used until that time. The first sets took up the entire back seat of the Lancia patrol cars.|$|E
50|$|Collinear dipole arrays {{are often}} used as the antennas for base {{stations}} for land mobile radio systems that communicate with <b>mobile</b> <b>two-way</b> <b>radios</b> in vehicles, such as police, fire, ambulance, and taxi dispatchers. They are also sometimes used for broadcasting.|$|R

5000|$|The {{history of}} mobile phones {{can be traced}} back to <b>two-way</b> <b>radios</b> {{permanently}} installed in vehicles such as taxicabs, police cruisers, railroad trains, and the like. Later versions such as the so-called transportables or [...] "bag phones" [...] were equipped with a cigarette lighter plug so that they could also be carried, and thus could be used as either <b>mobile</b> <b>two-way</b> <b>radios</b> or as portable phones by being patched into the telephone network.|$|R
50|$|User {{equipment}} {{designs are}} similar to commercial land <b>mobile</b> <b>two-way</b> <b>radio</b> except the maximum legal output power is 5 Watts. External antennas are permitted and commercially manufactured antennas have gains as high as 12 dB. Handheld transceivers (walkie talkies) are permitted and have transmit power from 500 mW to 5 W (full legal power) and are relatively cheap compared to full-sized transceivers. Operation in the band is restricted to modes F3E and G3E (FM or PM of analogue voice telephony).|$|E
50|$|From 1967 to 1973, during college, Galvin held {{part-time}} summer assignments at Motorola. From 1973-1983, {{he served}} full-time positions in sales, sales management, marketing management and <b>mobile</b> <b>two-way</b> <b>radio</b> product management, taking leave 1975-77 to attend graduate business school full-time. From 1983 to 1985, he became Marketing Director then General Manager of the Tegal semiconductor equipment unit owned by Motorola Inc. In 1985, he became Vice-President and Director of Motorola’s radio paging Division where he sponsored {{the team that}} created {{one of the first}} virtually completely automated manufacturing operations in the US, called Project Bandit. Galvin was promoted to Corporate Vice-President and General Manager of Paging. In 1988, he was named Chief Corporate Staff Officer of the corporation, later Senior Vice President and appointed to the Policy and Operating Committees of Motorola Inc. In 1990, he was promoted to Assistant Chief Operating Officer and joined as the third member of the Office of the CEO of Motorola Inc. In 1993, he was elevated to President and Chief Operating Officer. In 1997, he became CEO. In 1999, he added the role of Chairman of the Board to that of CEO.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{achievement of}} broadband high performance power amplifier (PA) {{line up for}} <b>mobile</b> <b>two-way</b> <b>radio</b> applications. In typical two-way radio applications the input radio-frequency signal to the first PA stage comes directly from the voltage controlled oscillator, with typically 3 dBm power. Owing to high output power requirement (similar to 80 W) of mobile radio applications, up to three PA device stages are normally cascaded (pre-driver, driver and final PA stage). The key point {{in the design of}} the PA line up concerns the final stage. Here, this paper introduces a design methodology based on parallel-combined impedance matching technique (from theoretical derivation) enables the designers to develop broadband PA with actual PA device impedance (implementation of new generation laterally diffused metal-oxide-semiconductor device). Experimental results demonstrated output power of similar to 80 W and gain of 45 dB, while preserving efficiency of 55 over the bandwidth from 760 to 870 MHz. According to author's knowledge, this amplifier demonstrated highest efficiency with 13 V DC supply (operating at 80 W) in UHF broadband frequency with high gain operation (more than 45 dB) up to date...|$|E
50|$|In {{the normal}} mode or {{broadside}} helical antenna, the diameter and {{the pitch of}} the aerial are small compared with the wavelength. The antenna acts similarly to an electrically short dipole or monopole, and the radiation pattern, similar to these antennas is omnidirectional, with maximum radiation {{at right angles to}} the helix axis. The radiation is linearly polarised parallel to the helix axis. These are used for compact antennas for portable and <b>mobile</b> <b>two-way</b> <b>radios,</b> and for UHF television broadcasting antennas.|$|R
50|$|For a {{vertically}} oriented dipole, {{which has}} an omnidirectional radiation pattern in the horizontal plane, {{it is possible to}} stack dipoles end-to-end fed in phase, creating a collinear antenna array. The array still has an omnidirectional pattern, but more power is radiated in the desired horizontal directions and less at large angles up into the sky or down toward the Earth. Collinear arrays are used in the VHF and UHF frequency bands at which the size of the dipoles are small enough so several can be stacked on a mast. They are a practical and higher-gain alternative to quarter wave ground plane antennas used in fixed base stations for <b>mobile</b> <b>two-way</b> <b>radios,</b> such as police, fire, and taxi dispatchers.|$|R
50|$|Also that year, Motorola's {{technologies}} {{were used}} to introduce the first <b>two-way</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>radio</b> with a fully transistorized power supply and receiver for cars.|$|R
5000|$|Gervan {{had promised}} his {{managers}} {{that the network}} would be ready for operation {{by the summer of}} 1948, requiring de Neuf's engineering staff and contractors to construct transmitter buildings and towers through the winter season. The likelihood of heavy precipitation in upstate New York's snowbelt required temporary heated shells to be erected around each building site, allowing concrete to be poured and masonry work to proceed on schedule. The worst weather conditions, by far, were encountered at the Turin site on the highest point of the Tug Hill Plateau, a remote area due east of Lake Ontario known for record lake-effect snowfall. Pending installation of telephone service, RRN engineers assigned to each construction site kept in contact by means of high-band VHF <b>mobile</b> <b>two-way</b> <b>radios</b> that were later modified for remote-pickup use.|$|R

50|$|IEDs made by inexperienced {{designers}} or with substandard materials {{may fail}} to detonate, and in some cases, they actually detonate on either the maker or the emplacer of the device. Some groups, however, {{have been known to}} produce sophisticated devices constructed with components scavenged from conventional munitions and standard consumer electronics components, such as <b>mobile</b> phones, consumer-grade <b>two-way</b> <b>radios,</b> washing machine timers, pagers, or garage door openers. The sophistication of an IED depends on the training of the designer and the tools and materials available.|$|R
50|$|Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) is a {{standard}} for the data transmission of internet content and services. It is a secure specification that allows users to access the information instantly via <b>mobile</b> phones, pagers, <b>two-way</b> <b>radios,</b> smartphones and communicators. WAP supports HTML and XML, and WML language, and is specifically designed for small screens and one-hand navigation without a keyboard. WML is scalable from two-line text displays up to the graphical screens found on smart phones. It is much stricter than HTML and is similar to JavaScript.|$|R
50|$|The Sensear {{earmuffs}} and earplugs {{developed by}} Sensear {{allow people to}} talk face to face and use <b>mobile</b> phone <b>two-way</b> <b>radio</b> communication in high noise (above 85 dB(A)) environments while providing hearing protection.Sensear uses a patented software system called SENS that actively ‘listens’ and seeks out human voices and actively suppresses background noise.Each Sensear unit {{is the size of}} a mobile phone and uses a series of directional microphones that process sound from all directions. A complex frequency algorithm determines which direction speech is coming from. Where speech is detected, ambient noise from other directions is suppressed while the speaker's voice is enhanced.The processed sound is delivered in stereo to the wearer. The units have a Bluetooth capability so users can talk on the phone without removing their protection.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s {{the mobile}} radio had the {{majority}} of its components stored in the trunk of a car and was comparable in size to a microwave oven. A Model 43 wattmeter was used to test the power output of the <b>two-way</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>radio</b> transmitter and to match it to an antenna most commonly mounted on the trunk. The transmission line to the antenna was very short providing easy access to the equipment which in turn made measuring the equipment convenient. Additionally, the same wattmeter was used to measure the RF power in the operational base station.|$|R
5000|$|The first radio {{systems could}} not {{transmit}} voice. This required training of operators in use of Morse code. On a ship, the radio operating officers (sometimes shortened to [...] "radio officers") typically {{had no other}} duties than handling radio messages. When voice transmission became possible, dedicated operators were no longer required and two-way use became more common. Today's <b>two-way</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>radio</b> equipment is nearly as simple {{to use as a}} household telephone, {{from the point of view}} of operating personnel, thereby making two-way communications a useful tool in a wide range of personal, commercial and military roles.|$|R
40|$|Wireless {{communication}} is {{the transfer of}} information over a distance {{without the use of}} enhanced electrical conductors or "wires”. The distances involved may be short (a few meters as in television remote control) or long (thousands or millions of kilometres for radio communications). When the context is clear, the term is often Shortened to "wireless". It encompasses various types of fixed, <b>mobile,</b> and portable <b>two-way</b> <b>radios,</b> cellular telephones, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), and wireless networking. In this paper we will throw light on the evolution and development of various generations of mobile wireless technology along with their significance and advantages of one over the other. In the past few decades, mobile wireless technologies have experience 4 or 5 generations of technology revolution and evolution, namely from 0 G to 4 G. Current research in mobile wireless technology concentrates on advance implementation of 4 G technology and 5 G technology. Currently 5 G term is not officially used. In 5 G researches are being made on development of World Wide Wireless Web (WWWW), Dynamic Adhoc Wireless Networks (DAWN) and Real Wireless World...|$|R
50|$|As <b>two-way</b> <b>radios</b> {{became the}} leading method of two-way communication, {{industries}} like movie and television production companies, security companies, event companies, sporting events and others {{needed to find}} a solution to use two way radios that was cost-effective and economically smart. Instead of buying <b>two-way</b> <b>radios</b> these companies began renting <b>two-way</b> <b>radios</b> short term and long term. The <b>two-way</b> <b>radio</b> rentals is a significant and important component of <b>two-way</b> <b>radio</b> businesses. Many have become reluctant to buy two way radios because of the duration of their event or the necessity to save money. Renting two way radios has brought comfort to customers in renting two way radios because the price and non commitment to owning such two way communication devices. Customers can rent anything from <b>two-way</b> <b>radios</b> to <b>two-way</b> <b>radio</b> equipment like speaker microphones or repeaters.|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} with NASA's ATS- 6 satellite, that demonstrates the practicality of satellite-aided land mobile communications is described. Satellite communications {{equipment for the}} experiment was designed {{so that it would}} be no more expensive, when mass produced, than conventional <b>two-way</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>radio</b> equipment. It embodied the operational features and convenience of present day mobile radios. Vehicle antennas 75 cm tall and 2 cm in diameter provided good commercial quality signals to and from trucks and jeeps. Operational applicability and usage data were gathered by installing the radio equipment in five long-haul tractor-trailer trucks and two Air Force search and rescue jeeps. Channel occupancy rates are reported. Air Force personnel found the satellite radio system extremely valuable in their search and rescue mission during maneuvers and actual rescue operations. Propagation data is subjectively analyzed and over 4 hours of random data is categorized and graded as to signal quality on a second by second basis. Trends in different topographic regions are reported. An overall communications reliability of 93 % was observed despite low satellite elevation angles ranging from 9 to 24 degrees...|$|R
