[...] Clonaid refused to identify the independent experts, because if revealed too soon, others could track the baby from the testing place into the mother's house. [...] Clonaid said the parents had the final say on {{whether they want to}} test the baby and that a Dutch lesbian couple would be the parents of the next cloned baby. Boisselier said she would hand over the evidence to show that a clone had in fact been born but was concerned that the details of Clonaid's cloning procedure might leak out. The next day, Vorilhon claimed that the baby was healthy. [...] He said those who are against cloning for ethical reasons would be dismayed if the clone baby was in good condition.|$|E

5000|$|During Ted Koppel's {{tenure as}} anchor (and on rare {{occasions}} since his departure), Nightline devoted each episode to a unique subject. Since its inception, the program has covered many subjects (science, education, politics, economics, society, and breaking news). Many candidates for government offices, such as David Duke (in November 1991) have appeared on Nightline to try to promote themselves. Seeing {{that there are a}} large number of prisons in the United States, it created an ongoing series in 1994 called [...] "Crime and Punishment". Over the years, Nightline had a number of technological firsts. The program did the first live report from the base of Mount Everest. In November 1992, science reporter <b>Michael</b> <b>Guillen</b> did the first live broadcast from Antarctica. There were times when a major breaking news story occurred as late as 11:00 p.m. Eastern Time, resulting in the subject of that night's edition being changed in order to cover the story in some form of detail, depending on the depth of information available at the time of broadcast. Examples of this were the deaths of John Lennon (1980) and Yasser Arafat (2004).|$|E
5000|$|Early in the film, Hazel {{purchases}} a {{house that}} is eternally on fire. At first showing reluctance to buy it, Hazel remarks to the real estate agent, [...] "I like it, I do. But I'm really concerned about dying in the fire," [...] which prompts the response [...] "It's a big decision, how one prefers to die." [...] In an interview with <b>Michael</b> <b>Guillén,</b> Kaufman stated, [...] "Well, she made the choice to live there. In fact, she says in the scene just before she dies that the end {{is built into the}} beginning. That's exactly what happens there. She chooses to live in this house. She's afraid it's going to kill her but she stays there and it does. That is the truth about any choice that we make. We make choices that resonate throughout our lives." [...] The burning house has been compared to the Tennessee Williams quote: [...] "We all live in a house on fire, no fire department to call; no way out, just the upstairs window to look out of while the fire burns the house down with us trapped, locked in it." ...|$|E
