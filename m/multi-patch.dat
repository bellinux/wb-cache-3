Here we extend the earlier work [...] static dispersal between neighbouring individuals to mobility of individuals as well as <b>multi-patches</b> environment. As is commonly found, the basic reproductive ratio is maximized for the evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) on diseases' persistence in mean-field theory. This has important implications, as it implies that {{for a wide range of}} parameters that infection rate will tend maximum. This is opposite with present results obtained in spatial explicit models that infection rate is limited by upper bound. We observe the emergence of trade-offs of extinction and persistence on the parameters of the infection period and infection rate and show the extinction time having a linear relationship with respect to system size. We further find that the higher mobility can pronouncedly promote the persistence of spread of epidemics, i. e., the phase transition occurs from extinction domain to persistence domain, and the spirals' wavelength increases as the mobility increasing and ultimately, it will saturate at a certain value. Furthermore, for <b>multi-patches</b> case, we find that the lower coupling strength leads to anti-phase oscillation of infected fraction, while higher coupling strength corresponds to in-phase oscillation.

40|$|Core {{shearing}} and core/face debonding are {{two common}} failure states of sandwich beams which are mainly {{the result of}} excessive shear stresses in the core. Generally, the core made of homogeneous Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) shows better shear resistance in comparison with that made of pure polymer. Usually, this enhancement is however somewhat limited. This paper proposes a methodology to decrease interfacial stresses by presenting the optimal distribution of reinforcing ingredients in the polymeric matrix. For this purpose, a Non-Uniform Rational Bspline (NURBS) based reinforcement distribution optimizer is developed. This technique aims at the local stress minimization within any arbitrary zone of the design domain. In our methodology, optimization and model analysis (calculation of the objective function and the design constraints) have common data sets. The quadratic NURBS basis functions smoothly define the reinforcement distribution function as a NURBS surface. The core and face sheets are modeled as <b>multi-patches</b> and compatibility in the displacement field is enforced by the penalty method.

The new filter structure {{is referred to as}} a collaborative adaptive Wiener filter (CAWF). The CAWF employs a finite size moving window.

A single-stage weighted sum of all of the pixels in the similar patches is used to estimate the center pixel in the reference patch. The weights are based on a new <b>multi-patch</b> correlation model that takes into account each pixel’s spatial distance to the center of its corresponding patch, as well as the intensity vector distances among the similar patches. One key advantage of the CAWF approach, compared with many other patch-based algorithms, is that it can jointly handle blur and noise. Furthermore, it can also readily treat spatially varying signal and noise statistics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first <b>multi-patch</b> algorithm to use a single spatial-domain weighted sum of all pixels within multiple similar patches to form its estimate and the first to use a spatial-domain <b>multi-patch</b> correlation model to determine the weights.

To manage the quality of the built model we studied a notion of continuity and join between parametric and discrete representations and we proposed a set of methods that guarantee that the models can be manipulated while maintaining predetermined continuity constraints among the constituent parts.

We investigate the effects such a pool of dispersers can have on local stability and dynamics {{for a variety of}} <b>multi-patch</b> host-parasitoid models. When an arbitrary number of patches with internal Lotka–Volterra dynamics is coupled via a global pool of dispersers, the equilibrium is globally stable. The global pool is stabilising if dispersal is by hosts only, by parasitoids only, or by both hosts and parasitoids. If dispersal is local such that individuals first enter a pool close to the patch where they originate and then disperse to adjacent pools, the equilibrium is locally stable. We also analyse the situation where the functional response of parasitoids within a patch is Holling type II which is known to destabilise host-parasitoid systems. Coupling this single patch to a pool of dispersers can produce a locally stable interaction, provided the handling time of hosts is not too long. However, the pool provides a biologically realistic example of an interaction that is locally stable but not permanent. The longer the handling time, the smaller the region of population densities within which populations converge to the equilibrium state. In a <b>multi-patch</b> environment with a global disperser pool, the dynamics of the system are not qualitatively different from the single patch case (i. e. the equilibrium can be locally stable but the system is not permanent). In a <b>multi-patch</b> environment with local disperser pools, true spatial interactions between patches can develop. In contrast to the global pool, local pools can destabilise the stable equilibrium of the single patch case. Limit cycles develop around this unstable equilibrium that lead to extremely complicated dynamics.

40|$|Scene parsing is an {{important}} and challenging prob- lem in computer vision. It requires labeling each pixel in an image with the category it belongs to. Tradition- ally, it has been approached with hand-engineered features from color information in images. Recently convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which automatically learn hierar- chies of features, have achieved record performance on the task. These approaches typically include a post-processing technique, such as superpixels, to produce the final label- ing.

30|$|Our {{approach}} is novel {{in that we}} use a single-pass spatial-domain weighted sum of all pixels within all of the similar patches to form the estimate each desired pixel. In the case of NLM, only the center pixel of each similar patch is given a weight [15].This is simple and effective for denoising, but deconvolution is not possible within the basic NLM framework, {{and all of the}} available information in the patches may not be exploited. While BM 3 D does fuse all of the pixels in the similar patches, the fusion in BM 3 D is based on a wavelet shrinkage operation and not a spatial-domain correlation model [32]. Because of the nature of wavelet shrinkage, the standard BM 3 D is also unable to perform deblurring [32]. On the other hand, the CAWF structure can jointly address blur and noise and does not employ separate transform-domain inverse filtering as in [38] or iterative processing like that in [39]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first <b>multi-patch</b> algorithm to use a single-pass weighted sum of all pixels within multiple similar patches to jointly address blur and noise.

40|$|Deep {{convolutional}} {{neural networks}} (CNN) {{have recently been}} shown to generate promising results for aesthetics assessment. However, the performance of these deep CNN methods is often compromised by the constraint that the neural network only takes the fixed-size input. To accommodate this requirement, input images need to be transformed via cropping, warping, or padding, which often alter image composition, reduce image resolution, or cause image distortion. Thus the aesthetics of the original images is impaired because of potential loss of fine grained details and holistic image layout. However, such fine grained details and holistic image layout is critical for evaluating an image's aesthetics. In this paper, we present an Adaptive Layout-Aware <b>Multi-Patch</b> Convolutional Neural Network (A-Lamp CNN) architecture for photo aesthetic assessment. This novel scheme is able to accept arbitrary sized images, and learn from both fined grained details and holistic image layout simultaneously.
