[...] On 22 January 1858, he became organist and maître de chapelle at the newly consecrated Sainte-Clotilde (from 1896 the Basilique-Sainte-Clotilde), where he remained until his death. [...] Eleven months later, the parish installed a new three-manual Cavaillé-Coll instrument, whereupon he was made titulaire, Théodore Dubois taking over as choirmaster and assistant organist. [...] The impact of this organ on Franck's performance and composition cannot be overestimated; together with his early pianistic experience it shaped his music-making {{for the remainder of}} his life. Norbert Dufourcq described this instrument as [...] "unquestionably the constructor's masterpiece up to this time". [...] Franck himself told the curé of Sainte-Clotilde: [...] "If you only knew how I love this instrument [...] [...] [...] it is so supple beneath my fingers and so obedient to all my thoughts!". [...] To prepare himself for this organ's capabilities (including its thirty-note pedal), Franck purchased a practice pedalboard from Pleyel et Cie for home practice to improve his technique, as well as spending many hours at the organ keyboard. [...] The beauty of its sound and the <b>mechanical</b> <b>facilities</b> provided by the instrument assisted his reputation as improviser and composer, not only for organ music but in other genres as well. [...] Pieces for organ, for choir, and for harmonium began to circulate, among the most notable of which was the Messe à 3 voix (1859). [...] The quality of the movements in this work, composed over a number of years, is uneven, but from it comes one of Franck's most enduring compositions, the communion anthem [...] "Panis Angelicus". [...] More notable still is the set of Six Pièces for organ, written 1860–1862 (although not published until 1868). [...] These compositions (dedicated to fellow organists and pianists, to his old master Benoist, and to Cavaillé-Coll) remain part of modern organ repertory and were, according to Rollin Smith, the first major contribution to French organ literature in over a century, and [...] "the most important organ music written since Mendelssohn's."
