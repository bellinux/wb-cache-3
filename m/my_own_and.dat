5|$|That rebellious {{attitude}} really came, I think, when {{my father}} remarried. Because for the three years before he married, I clung to him. It was like, OK, now you're mine, and you're not going anywhere. Like all young girls, I {{was in love with}} my father and I didn't want to lose him. I lost my mother, but then I was the mother, my father was mine. Then he got taken away from me when he married my stepmother. It was then that I said, OK I don’t need anybody. No one's going to break my heart again. I'm not going to need anybody. I can stand on <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> be my own person and not belong to anyone.|$|E
25|$|Reflecting on {{her work}} in musical films, Powell said: People are always fascinated by the {{so-called}} golden age of musicals, but it wasn’t all that great. Everything was glazed. Those movies didn’t reflect reality. I was at MGM for 11 years and nobody ever let me play anything but teenagers. I was 25 years old with kids of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> it was getting ridiculous. Publicity was froth. Everything you said was monitored. With me, they didn’t have to worry. I never had anything to say, anyway. It was hard work, I had no friends, no social interaction with people my age and the isolation was tough. But I had to support my family, so I did what I was told and had no other choice.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} on February 17, 2011, with Entertainment Weekly, Nathan Fillion joked that: [...] "If I got $300 million from the California Lottery, the first thing I would do is buy the rights to Firefly, make it on <b>my</b> <b>own,</b> <b>and</b> distribute it on the Internet". [...] This quickly {{gave rise to a}} fan-run initiative to raising the funds to purchase the rights.

500|$|Kafka {{left his}} work, both {{published}} and unpublished, {{to his friend}} and literary executor Max Brod with explicit instructions {{that it should be}} destroyed on Kafka's death; Kafka wrote: [...] "Dearest Max, my last request: Everything I leave behind me... in the way of diaries, manuscripts, letters (<b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> others'), sketches, and so on, [...] to be burned unread". Brod ignored this request and published the novels and collected works between 1925 and 1935. He took many papers, which remain unpublished, with him in suitcases to Palestine when he fled there in 1939. Kafka's last lover, Dora Diamant (later, Dymant-Lask), also ignored his wishes, secretly keeping 20notebooks and 35letters. These were confiscated by the Gestapo in 1933, but scholars continue to search for them.|$|E

500|$|Maria Theresa {{found herself}} in a {{difficult}} situation. She did not know enough about [...] matters of state and she {{was unaware of the}} weakness of her father's ministers. She decided to rely on her father's advice to retain his councillors and defer to her husband, whom she considered to be more experienced, on other matters. Both decisions, though natural, later gave cause for regret. Ten years later, Maria Theresa recalled in her Political Testament the circumstances under which she had ascended: [...] "I found myself without money, without credit, without army, without experience and knowledge of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> finally, also without any counsel because each one of them at first wanted to wait and see how things would develop." ...|$|E
500|$|Opinions of {{the films}} are {{generally}} divided among fans, with one group preferring the more faithful approach {{of the first two}} films, and another group preferring the more stylised character-driven approach of the later films. Rowling has been constantly supportive of all the films and evaluated Deathly Hallows as her [...] "favourite one" [...] in the series. She wrote on her website of the changes in the book-to-film transition, [...] "It is simply impossible to incorporate every one of my storylines into a film that has to be kept under four hours long. Obviously films have restrictions novels do not have, constraints of time and budget; I can create dazzling effects relying on nothing but the interaction of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> my readers' imaginations".|$|E

However, TTM claimed to hold the rights to her stage name, and announced their intentions to use that name to promote other artists. The matter was taken to court, and in early 2004 the ruling went in favour of Harisu, allowing her to keep the name. She subsequently set up her own company, G Entertainment, in order to make her own decisions regarding her career. In February she released her third album, Foxy Lady, which marked a change from the sound of her previous albums towards a more hip-hop/R style, with Harisu saying [...] "now I am on <b>my</b> <b>own,</b> <b>and</b> showing my true colors, doing exactly the kind of music that I've always wanted." [...] The album, however, failed to make the top 50 in the Korean charts.|$|E

500|$|Rihanna later {{described}} the sentiment {{she wanted to}} express as [...] "gangsta", and elaborated on how reggae culture has influenced her musical style: [...] "I'm super inspired by reggae music [...] {{has been a part}} of me since I was born, and I grew up listening to it. I was exciting for me to take this on as <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> do a song like this, especially with the lyrics being like that." [...] The track was composed during Rihanna's Last Girl on Earth tour. The song's instrumental was recorded by Cary Clark at The Village in Los Angeles. Kuk Harrell produced Rihanna's vocals with Josh Gudwin and Marcos Tovar at Westlake Recording Studios, also in Los Angeles. Bobby Campbell assisted with vocal production and recording. The song was mixed by Manny Marroquin at Larrabee Sound Studios in Los Angeles, assisted by Erik Madrid and Christian Plata.|$|E
500|$|All of {{the songs}} on Illinois were written, recorded, engineered, and {{produced}} by Stevens, {{with most of the}} material being recorded at The Buddy Project studio in Astoria, Queens, and in Stevens' Brooklyn apartment. As with his previous albums, Stevens recorded in various locations, with additional piano recorded in St. Paul's Church in Brooklyn; strings and vocals performed in collaborators' apartments; electronic organ recorded in the New Jerusalem Recreational Room in Clarksboro, New Jersey; and vibraphone played at Carroll Music Studios in New York City. Stevens mostly created the album without collaboration, focusing on the writing, performance, and technical creation of the album by himself: [...] "I was pretty nearsighted in the construction of Illinois. I {{spent a lot of time}} alone, a few months in isolation working on <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> in the studio. I let things germinate and cultivate independently, without thinking about an audience or a live show at all." ...|$|E
500|$|... "By {{the time}} of the film's release in 1939, there was some {{question}} as to who should receive screen credit," [...] writes Yeck. [...] "But despite the number of writers and changes, the final script was remarkably close to Howard's version. The fact that Howard's name alone appears on the credits may have been as much a gesture to his memory as to his writing, for in 1939 Sidney Howard died at age 48 in a farm-tractor accident, and before the movie's premiere." [...] Selznick, in a memo written in October 1939, discussed the film's writing credits: [...] "ou can say frankly that of the comparatively small amount of material in the picture which is not from the book, most is my own personally, and the only original lines of dialog which are not my own are a few from Sidney Howard and a few from Ben Hecht and a couple more from John Van Druten. Offhand I doubt that there are ten original words of [...] Garrett's in the whole script. As to construction, this is about eighty per cent <b>my</b> <b>own,</b> <b>and</b> the rest divided between Jo Swerling and Sidney Howard, with Hecht having contributed materially to the construction of one sequence." ...|$|E

500|$|Sweet began {{distancing}} {{himself from}} {{other people in the}} Athens music scene and in 1984 quit Oh-OK; by 1985, the Buzz of Delight had broken up. That year, Sweet got a record deal with CBS Records and moved to New York City. He was accused of being opportunistic and using his Athens connections to get a record deal and leave. Sweet maintains that when he went to CBS, he never claimed {{to have anything to do}} with Athens, so that nobody could say he used the town. He says that after months of living in Athens, he realized things weren't as happy there as everyone pretended, and that there was backstabbing going on. In 1993, he said, [...] "Things really turned dark there when R.E.M. got famous, because everyone wanted that fame so bad. Maybe I wanted it too, but I had this musical goal all of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> wasn't going to go along with the way it was done there." [...] Everybody was telling him that he should be touring and building up a following before doing his record, like R.E.M. had done. However, more than making the record itself and becoming a rock star, Sweet's main motivation was to get money to buy studio gear.|$|E
500|$|The book, {{which was}} Rowling's debut novel, was written between {{approximately}} June 1990 and {{some time in}} 1995. In 1990 Jo Rowling, as she preferred to be known, wanted to move with her boyfriend to a flat in Manchester and in her words, [...] "One weekend after flat hunting, I took the train back to London on <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>and</b> the idea for Harry Potter fell into my head... A scrawny, little, black-haired, bespectacled boy {{became more and more}} of a wizard to me... I began to write Philosopher's Stone that very evening. Although, the first couple of pages look nothing like the finished product." [...] Then Rowling's mother died and, to cope with her pain, Rowling transferred her own anguish to the orphan Harry. Rowling spent six years working on Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and after it was accepted by Bloomsbury, she obtained a grant of £8,000 from the Scottish Arts Council, which enabled her to plan the sequels. She sent the book to an agent and a publisher, and then the second agent she approached spent a year trying to sell the book to publishers, most of whom thought it was too long at about 90,000words. Barry Cunningham, who was building a portfolio of distinctive fantasies by new authors for Bloomsbury Children's Books, recommended accepting the book, and the eight-year-old daughter of Bloomsbury's chief executive said it was [...] "so much better than anything else".|$|E
