500|$|The early {{screening}} of the pilot at San Diego Comic-Con International was met with a very positive reaction from the crowd. Critically, the initial {{screening of}} the pilot was met with mostly positive reviews, though The New York Times Brooks Barnes noted that [...] "what goes over well at Comic-Con does not necessarily work in the real world," [...] especially on a network with [...] "Scandal <b>moms</b> <b>and</b> Dancing with the Stars grandparents". Entertainment Weeklys initial reactions were that if everything that made the show appealing its continuity with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, its continuance of The Avengers storyline, and Whedon's return to television, were stripped from it, the show would still work. However, they also questioned whether the show was accessible enough to attract a wider audience.|$|E

[...] She added, however, that [...] "Some of the lyrics and dialogue are not easily understoodit sounds as if adult voices may be attempting to simulate the voices of small children." [...] In August 2007, Kirsten Martindale gave the DVD set a positive review. She wrote that [...] "Fans [...] will be thoroughly engaged by these two episodes", and recommended it [...] "For nostalgic <b>moms</b> <b>and</b> their young daughters." [...] She however singled out the audio and video quality: [...] "or those who haven't experienced the charm and simplicity of older cartoons, this may be annoying, but the nostalgic effect of the original presentation is relaxed and welcome."

500|$|Ben Ratliff of The New York Times said Cyrus' {{attempt to}} leave Hannah Montana was weak, only {{being driven by}} [...] "more gray thoughts". Ratliff continued, [...] "She eases up on songs with total-affirmation chants about being the captain of her ship ... The lyrics are half-terrible — almost too {{realistic}} as teenage thoughts — but {{the best of them}} transmit the desired message ... It’s a lackluster album, floated by two or three strong singles." [...] Josh Timmermann of PopMatters believed Breakout was [...] "a just-okay teenpop record with audible suggestions of said singer-songwriter aspirations. To be sure, it’s a stronger collection of songs than <b>Moms</b> <b>and</b> Dads with upturned noses ... would probably expect." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine rated the album two and half stars out of five, being disappointed and deeming the songs not to be a [...] "worthy follow-up" [...] to [...] "See You Again". Cinquemani finished, [...] "For teen-pop, your kid could do worse. You know, like Avril [...] ". Mordechai Shinefield of The Village Voice wrote, [...] "If her lyrical prowess hasn't caught up to her voice yet, that should only hold promise of things to come. She's a rare talent; now she only has to survive until adulthood." [...] Ash Dosanjh of Yahoo! Music gave Breakout seven stars out of ten and referred to Cyrus, in Breakout, as the ideal of the American Dream: [...] "a combination of hard work, good Christian living and un-smutty pop".|$|E

500|$|According to Saadiq, [...] "Just One Kiss" [...] can be {{interpreted}} as a song devoted to a female love interest, [...] "but I'm really talking about music and what it did for me. That one guitar line, that certain drum beat, how it turned my life into a ball of gold." [...] The song incorporates cinematic strings, xylophone, and a rolling crescendo. The ballad [...] "Calling", featuring Mexican balladeer Rocio Mendoza, draws on Motown's late 1950s R roots and doo-wop music, and incorporates Latin style guitar, and Spanish language lyrics. [...] "Staying in Love", an uptempo rhythm and blues song, was written by Saadiq after he thought of an ex-girlfriend. Incongruous with its 1960s-inspired sound, [...] "Let's Take a Walk" [...] has sexually forward lyrics and , which the narrator uses to bluntly proposition his love interest. The midtempo [...] "Never Give You Up" [...] is fashioned in Motown's early 1970 sound and, unlike other songs on the album, also incorporates elements from more modern soul music. [...] "Sometimes", which was inspired by Saadiq's upbringing in a tough neighborhood in Oakland, is about dealing with the fatigue of universal hardships when they are worsened by the burden of racism. The line [...] "now I know what they meant by 'keep your head to the sky'" [...] makes reference to Earth, Wind & Fire, whose music Saadiq immersed himself in while growing up. Saadiq said of the song's message, [...] "That's just giving dap to my <b>moms</b> <b>and</b> grandmother and the people who raised me in the neighborhood to let them know its easy but not as easy as it seems all the time and sometimes we have to back up and cry but I'm just giving thanks to the people that helped me along the way." ...|$|E

The Houston Press Daniel Carlson wrote that [...] "The Moms" [...] was [...] "fun but lighter than air, content to string together a mild plot with a series of good jokes and callbacks." [...] Nick Catucci for New York magazine was positive about the episode, and reported that Tracy and Novella Nelson had the best chemistry of the night.|$|E
