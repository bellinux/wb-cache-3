25|$|The {{catalase}} test {{is one of}} {{the three}} main tests used by microbiologists to identify species of bacteria. If the bacteria possess catalase (i.e., are catalase-positive), when a small amount of bacterial isolate is added to hydrogen peroxide, bubbles of oxygen are observed. The catalase test is done by placing a drop of hydrogen peroxide on a <b>microscope</b> <b>slide.</b> An applicator stick is touched to the colony, and the tip is then smeared onto the hydrogen peroxide drop.|$|E
25|$|Many {{diseases}} involving {{red blood}} cells are diagnosed with a blood film (or peripheral blood smear), where {{a thin layer of}} blood is smeared on a <b>microscope</b> <b>slide.</b> This may reveal abnormalities of red blood cell shape and form. When {{red blood cells}} sometimes occur as a stack, flat side next to flat side. This is known as rouleaux formation, and it occurs more often if the levels of certain serum proteins are elevated, as for instance during inflammation.|$|E

25|$|A {{counting}} chamber,(also {{known as}} hemocytometer), is a <b>microscope</b> <b>slide</b> that is especially designed to enable cell counting. The hemocytometer has two gridded chambers in its middle, which {{are covered with}} a special glass slide when counting. A drop of cell culture {{is placed in the}} space between the chamber and the glass cover, filling it by capillarity. Looking at the sample under the microscope, the researcher uses the grid to manually count the number of cells in a certain area of known size. The separating distance between the chamber and the cover is predefined, thus the volume of the counted culture can be calculated and with it the concentration of cells. Cell viability can also be determined if viability dyes are added to the fluid.|$|E
2500|$|Cytopathology (sometimes {{referred}} to as [...] "cytology") is a branch of pathology that studies and diagnoses diseases on the cellular level. It is usually used {{to aid in the}} diagnosis of cancer, but also helps in the diagnosis of certain infectious diseases and other inflammatory conditions as well as thyroid lesions, diseases involving sterile body cavities (peritoneal, pleural, and cerebrospinal), and a wide range of other body sites. [...] Cytopathology is generally used on samples of free cells or tissue fragments (in contrast to histopathology, which studies whole tissues) and cytopathologic tests are sometimes called smear tests because the samples may be smeared across a glass <b>microscope</b> <b>slide</b> for subsequent staining and microscopic examination. [...] However, cytology samples may be prepared in other ways, including cytocentrifugation.|$|E
2500|$|Chester Carlson, the {{inventor}} of photocopying, was originally a patent attorney and part-time researcher and inventor. His job at the patent office in New York City required {{him to make a}} large number of copies of important papers. Carlson, who was arthritic, found this a painful and tedious process. This prompted him to conduct experiments with photoconductivity. Carlson experimented with [...] "electrophotography" [...] in his kitchen and in 1938, applied for a patent for the process. He made the first [...] "photocopy" [...] using a zinc plate covered with sulfur. The words [...] "10-22-38 Astoria" [...] were written on a <b>microscope</b> <b>slide,</b> which was placed on top of more sulfur and under a bright light. After the slide was removed, a mirror image of the words remained. Carlson tried to sell his invention to some companies, but because the process was still underdeveloped he failed. At the time multiple copies were made using carbon paper or duplicating machines and people did not feel the need for an electronic machine. Between 1939 and 1944, Carlson was turned down by over 20 companies, including IBM and GE, neither of which believed there was a significant market for copiers.|$|E

2500|$|Expanding {{the beam}} emitted from the laser {{to fill the}} {{aperture}} of the objective {{will result in a}} tighter, diffraction-limited spot. While lateral translation of the trap relative to the sample can be accomplished by translation of the <b>microscope</b> <b>slide,</b> most tweezer setups have additional optics designed to translate the beam to give an extra degree of translational freedom. This can be done by translating the first of the two lenses labelled as [...] "Beam Steering" [...] in the figure. For example, translation of that lens in the lateral plane will result in a laterally deflected beam from what is drawn in the figure. If the distance between the beam steering lenses and the objective is chosen properly, this will correspond to a similar deflection before entering the objective and a resulting lateral translation in the sample plane. The position of the beam waist, that is the focus of the optical trap, can be adjusted by an axial displacement of the initial lens. Such an axial displacement causes the beam to diverge or converge slightly, the end result of which is an axially displaced position of the beam waist in the sample chamber.|$|E
