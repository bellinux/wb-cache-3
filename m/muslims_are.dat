5|$|Islam in Japan is {{estimated}} to constitute, about 80–90%, of foreign born migrants and their children, primarily from Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Iran. Much of the ethnic Japanese <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> those who convert upon marrying immigrant Muslims. The Pew Research Center estimated that there were 185,000 Muslims in Japan in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Islam is also practiced on the island. Islam {{was first}} brought to Madagascar in the Middle Ages by Arab and Somali Muslim traders, who {{established}} several Islamic schools {{along the eastern}} coast. While the use of Arabic script and loan words and the adoption of Islamic astrology would spread across the island, the Islamic religion failed to take hold in {{all but a handful}} of southeastern coastal communities. Today, Muslims constitute 7–3percent of the population of Madagascar and are largely concentrated in the northwestern provinces of Mahajanga and Antsiranana. The vast majority of <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> Sunni. <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> divided between those of Malagasy ethnicity, Indians, Pakistanis and Comorians. More recently, Hinduism was introduced to Madagascar through Gujarati people immigrating from the Saurashtra region of India in the late 19th century. Most Hindus in Madagascar speak Gujarati or Hindi at home.|$|E

Zoroastrians living under Muslim rule were required to pay a tax called Jizya.|$|E
5|$|Where Malay <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> concerned, the {{application}} of Muslim law is modified by Malay custom as regards marriage, divorce {{and the distribution of}} the estate of an intestate person. In fact, Muslim customary law and the Malay custom applicable to Malay Muslims appear to be the only strands of customary law that continue to have some significance in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|After much fanfare, Muhammad departs jannah airport, {{riding a}} buraq, or winged horse. The Archangel Gabriel accompanies him. On the way, they {{encounter}} a Soviet spacecraft. Hearing {{that they are}} infidels, Muhammad approaches to investigate, only to crash into the spacecraft, obliterating it and the buraq and killing the three cosmonauts; Muhammad and Gabriel are able to catch a cloud. Later, they pass Jakarta, which Gabriel describes as the most sinful place on Earth. Angered by Gabriel's statement that less than a million of Indonesia's 90 million <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> true believers, {{as well as the}} fact that it is the birthplace of Nasakom, Muhammad declares that Islam will never die and waits on the cloud.|$|E

50|$|In 1903, the Gajret {{cultural}} {{society was}} established; it promoted Serbian identity among the Slavic Muslims of Austria-Hungary (today's Bosnia and Herzegovina) and viewed that the <b>Muslims</b> <b>were</b> Serbs lacking ethnic consciousness.

5|$|Cameroon has a {{high level}} of {{religious}} freedom and diversity. The predominant faith is Christianity, practiced by about two-thirds of the population, while Islam is a significant minority faith, adhered to by about one-fifth. In addition, traditional faiths are practiced by many. <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> most concentrated in the north, while Christians are concentrated primarily in the southern and western regions, but practitioners of both faiths can be found throughout the country. Large cities have significant populations of both groups. Muslims in Cameroon are divided into Sunnis (including Wahhabis), Shias, Sufis, and non-denominational Muslims.|$|E

5|$|Muhammad and {{the other}} prophets of Islam, bored of living in jannah (heaven) and weary of singing the praises of Allah, request {{permission}} to return to Earth. Disappointed by the prophets' request, Allah calls on Muhammad {{to explain why he}} wishes to return, as Allah had already granted him many things. Muhammad replies that he wishes to conduct research, to discover why so few <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> coming to heaven. Allah, after removing his glasses, responds that the people had been poisoned by Sukarno's policy of Nasakom and grants Muhammad permission to investigate further.|$|E
5|$|<b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> {{obliged to}} follow the {{decisions}} of Syariah courts in matters concerning their religion. The Islamic judges are expected {{to follow the}} Shafi'i legal school of Islam, which is the main madh'hab of Malaysia. The jurisdiction of Syariah courts is limited to Muslims in matters such as marriage, inheritance, divorce, apostasy, religious conversion, and custody among others. No other criminal or civil offences are {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Shariah courts, which have a similar hierarchy to the Civil Courts. Despite being the supreme courts of the land, the Civil Courts do not hear matters related to Islamic practices.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of Muslims in Nigeria are Sunni belonging to Maliki school of jurisprudence; however, a sizeable minority also belongs to Shafi madhhab. A large number of Sunni <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> members of Sufi brotherhoods. Most Sufis follow the Qadiriyya, Tijaniyyah and/or the Mouride movements. A significant Shia minority exists (see Shia in Nigeria). Some northern states have incorporated Sharia law into their previously secular legal systems, which has brought about some controversy. Kano State has sought to incorporate Sharia law into its constitution. The majority of Quranists follow the Kalo Kato or Quraniyyun movement. There are also Ahmadiyya and Mahdiyya minorities.|$|E

5|$|Chad is a religiously diverse country. The 1993 census {{found that}} 54% of Chadians were Muslim (of these, {{according}} to a Pew report 48% professed to be Sunni, 21% Shia, 4% Ahmadi and 23% just Muslim). Roughly 20% of Chadians are Roman Catholic, 14% Protestant, 10% animist, while 3% did not profess any religion. None of these religious traditions are monolithic. Animism includes a variety of ancestor and place-oriented religions whose expression is highly specific. Islam is expressed in diverse ways; for example, according to the Pew report mentioned earlier 55% of Muslim Chadians belong to Sufi orders. Christianity arrived in Chad with the French and American missionaries; as with Chadian Islam, it syncretises aspects of pre-Christian religious beliefs. <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> largely concentrated in northern and eastern Chad, and animists and Christians live primarily in southern Chad and Guéra. The constitution provides for a secular state and guarantees religious freedom; different religious communities generally co-exist without problems.|$|E
5|$|Silk weaving is the {{dominant}} industry in Varanasi. <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> the influential community in this industry with {{nearly half a million}} of them working as weavers, dyers, sari finishers, and salespersons. Weaving is typically done within the household, and most weavers are Momin Ansari Muslims. Varanasi is known throughout India for its production of very fine silk and Banarasi saris, brocades with gold and silver thread work, which are often used for weddings and special occasions. The production of silk often uses bonded child labour, though perhaps not at a higher rate than elsewhere in India. The silk weaving industry has recently been threatened by the rise of power looms and computer-generated designs and by competition from Chinese silk imports.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>Muslims</b> <b>are</b> also {{opposed to}} men having long hair {{as it is}} also {{important}} in Islam to have clear differences (in appearance) between sexes. And generally these cultures encourage women to have long hair and men to have short hair. The Taliban in Afghanistan viewed long hair for men as a western influence, and punished it by arrest and forced haircuts, although this would be a direct contradiction of the sunnah of the Prophet. Similar measures have been taken by Islamists in Iraq. In spite of this, several Taliban affiliated members of the Mehsud clan are recognisable by their long hair. The Saudi Islamist fighter Amir Khattab was also notable for his long hair. Dervishes of some Sufi orders, such as the Kasnazani, often have long hair and whirl it around during rituals.|$|E

Coconut and curry leaves are common ingredients to most Mangalorean curry, as are ginger, garlic and chili. Well-known Mangalorean dishes include Kori Rotti, Neer dosa, Pundi, Patrode, Mangalore Buns, Mangalore bajji, Macaroon etc. Mangalorean Cuisine is also known for Fish and chicken dishes like Bangude Pulimunchi (spicy sour silver-grey mackerels), Boothai Gasi (Sardine Semi-Gravy), Anjal fry, Mangalorean Chicken Sukka, Kori rotti, Chicken Ghee Roast etc. Since Mangalore is a coastal city, fish forms the staple diet of most people.
