5|$|Food Circus: The Food Circus was a {{food court}} in the former armory, later named the Center House, and {{recently}} renamed The Armory (2012) as a remodel of the building continues. Unlike the current arrangement with a stage and a large open space for dancing, events, and temporary booths, many food booths were in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{as well as at}} the edges. There were 52concessionaires in all, nine of them with exhibits in addition to their food for sale. Beginning in 1963, the Food Circus also housed a variety of museums, including Jones' Fantastic Show, the Jules Charbneau World of Miniatures, and the Pullen Klondike Museum.|$|E
5|$|The McCanns' {{children}} {{slept in}} a bedroom next to the front door, which the McCanns kept locked. The bedroom had one waist-high window with curtains and a metal exterior shutter, the latter controlled by a cord inside the window; the McCanns kept the curtains and shutter closed throughout the holiday. The window overlooked a narrow walkway and residents' car park, which was separated by a low wall from the street. Madeleine {{slept in a}} single bed next to the bedroom door, {{on the opposite side}} of the room from the window, while the twins were in travel cots in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> There was another, empty, single bed underneath the window.|$|E

50|$|This {{exhibition}} was conceived as an orchestrated walking tour with pauses and hindrances: the sculptures in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> are spread over different exhibition spaces, thus reducing the available space {{and creating a}} trajectory past the old masters that sometimes leads to a dead-end. The lines, areas, and solid colours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sculptures harmonize on an abstract level with the furnishings, the architecture, and the paintings, resulting in a Gesamtkunstwerk.|$|R

5|$|The video {{starts with}} Farmer slowly walking in an {{laboratory}} {{in which many}} animals are captive to serve as experiments. Depicting a supernatural creature, the singer approaches every cage {{to look at all}} the animals — pigeons, cats, bobcats, rabbits, mouses, a snake, an owl, a monkey, a doe — and heals them with her magic hands. Then she takes a wounded little cat out of its cage and puts it on her shoulders. During the second refrain, she remains standing with closed eyes in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and uses her supernatural powers to explode all of the glass cages. She thus releases the animals and, with a monkey in her arms, leads them outside into the woods. Standing in the forest, she closes her eyes again and sends many rays of light from her hands. The last scene shows the Earth being covered by that light.|$|E
25|$|Various {{structural}} innovations {{have been}} devised to permit women to lead prayers while maintaining distinct men's and women's sections, such as separate shtenders (reader's lecterns) and a mechitza going down the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Men can also be limited in which service parts they can lead.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> a small cistern can be found, {{a common}} {{addition}} to Roman temples. The {{water in the}} reservoir was supplied via a drainage system.

25|$|The doors {{have very}} fine inlay work. On {{the right side}} of the {{entrance}} is a fireplace with a gilded hood. In the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> is a silver 'mangal' (charcoal stove), a present of King Louis XIV of France. From the mid-18th century onwards, the building was used as the library of the Privy Chamber.|$|E
25|$|Sleepwalking Sleepwalking {{can lead}} to bedwetting. During sleepwalking, the sleepwalker may think he/she is in another room. When the sleepwalker urinates during a sleepwalking episode, he/she usually thinks {{they are in the}} bathroom, and {{therefore}} urinate where they think the toilet should be. Cases of this have included opening a closet and urinating in it; urinating on the sofa and simply urinating in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hairdressing takes {{almost two}} hours, she said, and while {{my hair is}} busy, my mind stays idle. I am afraid that my mind escapes through the hair and onto the fingers of my hairdresser.

25|$|Examples of {{children}} raised under the Kibbutz system of equality are given by Yosef Criden. When an aunt {{from a nearby}} city comes to visit her niece or nephew and brings a box of chocolate as a present for them, the child will excitedly open it up and eat {{a few of the}} chocolates. Then the child will go over {{to the rest of the}} group and give the rest of the chocolates to their peers. This is the ideology instilled in the children, to value the self but also to always think about others. Another example Yosef gives is that when his son, who was born and raised on a kibbutz, went into the army, he and his fellow bunk mates asked their supervising officer for a box. They wanted to keep the box in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and whenever they would get care packages, they would put the items into the box and share them communally. They did not want to be like most of the units of officers from towns and cities, where each officer would hide their packages under their beds.|$|E

In total, the film crew used 500 rats. Initially, Wharmby had an issue getting the rats in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> being shot. In order to fix this, animal trainers continuously released more rats until the middle part of the room was finally covered. The crew later spent many hours [...] "painting out rat droppings in that shot." ...|$|E

500|$|In June 1972, {{the band}} reconvened in Los Angeles {{to begin work}} on their next album at the Record Plant. The {{recording}} process was plagued with problems, many {{as a result of}} substance abuse issues. While struggling to record the song [...] "Cornucopia" [...] after [...] "sitting in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> just doing drugs", Ward was nearly fired from the band. [...] "I hated the song, there were some patterns that were just... horrible" [...] Ward said. [...] "I nailed it in the end, but the reaction I got was the cold shoulder from everybody. It was like 'Well, just go home, you're not being of any use right now.' I felt like I'd blown it, I was about to get fired". The album was originally titled Snowblind after the song of the same name, which deals with cocaine abuse. The record company changed the title at the last minute to Black Sabbath Vol. 4, with Ward stating [...] "There was no Volume 1, 2 or 3, so it's a pretty stupid title really".|$|E
500|$|... its album tracks such as [...] "D.S." [...] and {{corresponding}} music videos are {{heavily influenced by}} the 1993 child sexual abuse accusations made against Jackson, {{the reaction to the}} allegations and the effect they had on the singer. The album acts as Jackson's response to the media and the public. In 1993, Evan Chandler and his son Jordan Chandler accused Jackson of child sexual abuse. Jackson agreed to a strip search of his body at Neverland Ranch; the strip search was ordered by Thomas W. Sneddon Jr., the district attorney of Santa Barbara County, California. Sneddon {{was in charge of the}} investigation as a whole. The accuser gave a detailed description of what he alleges were Jackson's genitals, also giving details on patches of vitiligo on the singer's body, but eventually the description was proved wrong. In an emotional state, Jackson stood on a platform in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> took off all his clothes and was examined for approximately twenty-five minutes; he was never physically touched.|$|E

500|$|The video {{takes place}} in a large cathedral-like room, with large winding {{staircases}} on each side. Throughout the video, the scenery changes several times from a cloudy and sunny day, to a glowing sunset. These time shifts are seen through a large carved window in the cathedral. The video begins with Carey's hair in long golden curls, and her wearing a skin-tight black jumper. She sits on the large ledge by the window, staring into the different colors in the sky. As the video progresses, Carey is joined by a small black cat, which accompanies her as she meditates on the large stairwell. After the song's second verse, a large microphone is seen in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> where scenes of Carey singing and standing on the window's ledge interchange. The last scenes show Carey staring out into the meadow, smiling. According to author Chris Nickson, during the scenes of Carey by the large window, it is [...] "obvious" [...] that she is praying to God and connecting to her creator. He felt that alongside the song's lyrics of faith and prayer, the video's moments of meditation truly went [...] "hand in hand." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 1798, Kościuszko {{received}} {{a bundle of}} letters from Europe. The news {{in one of them}} came as a shock to him, causing him, still in his wounded condition, to spring from his couch and limp unassisted to the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and exclaim to General Anthony Walton White, [...] "I must return at once to Europe!" [...] The letter in question contained news that Polish General Jan Henryk Dąbrowski and Polish soldiers were fighting in France under Napoleon and that Kościuszko's sister had sent his two nephews in Kościuszko's name to serve in Napoleon's ranks. Around that time Kościuszko also received news that Talleyrand was seeking Kościuszko's moral and public endorsement for the French fight against one of Poland's partitioners, Prussia. The call of family and country drew Kościuszko back to Europe. He immediately consulted Thomas Jefferson, who procured him a passport under a false name and arranged for his secret departure for France. Kościuszko left no word for either his former comrade-in-arms and fellow St. Petersburg prisoner Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz or for his own servant, only leaving some money for them.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{architect of}} the Roger Mowry Tavern is not known for certain. Robert A. Geake's book Historic Taverns of Rhode Island suggests {{it may have been}} the work of William Carpenter and the mason John Smith. The original house began as a -story stone ender with a single [...] by roughly [...] fire room. Running lengthwise across the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> is a large summer beam. On the right side of the fireplace was the stairs or ladder that lead to the upstairs chamber. At an unknown date, the roof of the original house was extended higher, as evidenced by the original beams ending about [...] above the floor. By 1711, the house had a two-story lean-to. By the late 19th century the house had been greatly altered, but the original structure was restored by Robert Isham. Isham found and restored the house, which still featured the original posts and beams. The large fireplace remained intact, but was concealed behind a fireboard and closet, that was itself behind a stove. The result was that stone fireplace was completely concealed prior to restoration. Less than a decade later after Isham restored the original part of the house, the whole structure was demolished.|$|E
