40|$|The {{bacterial}} wilts {{of banana}} known as <b>Moko</b> <b>disease,</b> Bugtok disease and blood disease {{are caused by}} members of the R. solanacearum species complex. R. solanacearum is a heterogeneous species which has been divided into 4 genetic groups known as phylotypes. Within the R. solanacearum species complex, strains that cause Moko and Bugtok diseases belong to phylotype II. The blood disease bacterium, the cause of blood disease, belongs to phylotype IV. This study employs phylogenetic analysis of partial endoglucanase gene sequences to further assess the evolutionary relationships between strains of R. solanacearum causing <b>Moko</b> <b>disease</b> and Bugtok disease and the relationship of the blood disease bacterium to other R. solanacearum strains within phylotype IV of the R. solanacearum species complex. These analyses showed that R. solanacearum Moko disease-causing strains are polyphyletic, forming four related, but distinct, clusters of strains. One of these clusters is a previously unrecognised group of R. solanacearum Moko disease-causing strains. It was also found that R. solanacearum strains that cause Bugtok disease are indistinguishable from strains causing <b>Moko</b> <b>disease</b> in the Philippines. Phylogenetic analysis of partial endoglucanase gene sequences of the strains of the blood disease confirms a close relationship of these strains to R. solanacearum strains within phylotype IV of the R. solanacearum species complex...|$|E

The disease is always associated with <b>Moko</b> <b>disease</b> caused by Ralstonia solanacearum. The bacterium forms irregular round, creamy colonies with red centres when cultured on Kelman’s tetrazolium chloride (TZC) medium. <b>Moko</b> <b>disease</b> has been interchangeably identified as blood disease as both of them cause similar wilting symptoms on banana. Therefore, the present study was carried out to detect the occurrence of bacterial wilt in Selangor through comprehensive procedures on morphology, molecular, pathogenicity and specificity tests. Isolation of bacteria was conducted on infected plant samples (fruit stalk, fruit pulps, stem and root) collected in the field by plating on TZC medium. Bacteria colonies that are Gram-negative, oxidase-positive, and obligate aerobe were chosen for further identification through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using 759 F and 760 R primers. Molecular identification showed the bacteria that colonized the infected plants is confirmed as BDB, which is very closely related to R. solanacearum.

40|$|Banana (Musa sp.) {{represents}} {{one of the most important}} world food crops after maize, rice, wheat and cassava. Many pests and diseases have significantly affected banana cultivation. Banana Xanthomonas wilt (BXW), caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum, is one of the most important diseases and currently considered as the biggest threat to banana production in the Great Lakes region of Africa including Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Kenya, Tanzania and Burundi. The pathogen is highly contagious and its spread has endangered the livelihood of millions of farmers who rely on banana for food and income. The development of disease resistant bananas remains a high priority since farmers are reluctant to employ labor-intensive disease control measures and there is no host plant resistance among banana cultivars. The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), in partnership with the National Agriculture Research Organization (NARO), Uganda and the African Agriculture Technology Foundation (AATF), have developed hundreds of transgenic bananas constitutively expressing the Hypersensitive Response Assisting Protein (Hrap) or Plant Ferredoxin Like Protein (Pflp) gene originated from sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum). These transgenic lines have exhibited strong resistance to BXW in the laboratory and screen house tests. The best 65 resistant lines were planted in a confined field trial in October 2010 at NARL, Kawanda, Uganda after approval from the National Biosafety Committee. This is a significant step toward development of transgenic banana cultivars resistant to BXW, which will boost the available arsenal to fight this epidemic disease and save livelihoods in Africa. These transgenic lines are under evaluation for disease resistance and agronomic performance in field conditions. This technology may also provide effective control to other bacterial <b>diseases</b> such as <b>moko</b> or blood <b>disease</b> of banana occurring in other parts of the world. Peer Revie...|$|R

In the present study, chlorine dioxide and seven resistance inducers in banana plants (Musa sp.) infected with this bacterium were evaluated under greenhouse conditions. For the evaluation of chlorine dioxide, three doses were used (10, 30 and 50 mg L- 1). The evaluation of the resistance inducers included the following: sodium salicylate 0. 4 g L- 1; hydrogen peroxide 1 mM; potassium phosphite 1. 5 mL L- 1; 3 -aminobutanoic acid 1. 0 g L- 1; methyl jasmonate 0. 2 g L- 1; acibenzolar-s-methyl 0. 3 mL L- 1 and chitosan 3. 0 mg mL- 1.

40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Plant Health was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on 30 pest risk assessments made by France on organisms which are considered by France as harmful in four French overseas departments, i. e. French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion. In particular, the Panel was asked whether these organisms {{can be considered as}} harmful organisms for the endangered area of the above departments, in the meaning of the definition mentioned in Article 2. 1. (e) of Directive 2000 / 29 /EC and thus potentially eligible for addition to the list of harmful organisms in Directive 2000 / 29 /EC. This document presents the opinion of the Panel on Plant Health on the simplified[2] pest risk assessment conducted by France on Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearumwith French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion considered as endangered area. The bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum is the causal agent of an emerging disease of bananas, called Xanthomonas wilt. The disease, which results in wilting and eventually in death of plants, already causes serious phytosanitary problems in some Eastern African countries. The Panel examined in detail the risk assessment provided, and considered the accuracy and quality of the information provided and methods applied for pest risk assessment purposes. The review was based on the principles of the International Standard on Phytosanitary Measures ISPM No. 11 [3]: Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests including analysis of environmental risks and living modified organisms (2004) by the International Plant Protection Convention (FAO, 2007 c). The Panel concludes that the following information were not sufficiently taken into consideration nor adequately documented in the pest risk assessment prepared by France:*specificities related to the geographic location of each of the four French overseas departments,*potential pathways of entry,*climatic similarities between the PRA area[4] and the areas where the bacterium is present,*area of land cultivated with banana and the distribution of banana plantations and/or private gardens in each of the French overseas departments,*banana cultivars grown in the PRA area and the characteristics concerning their flower phenology,*economic importance of banana crop for each of the French overseas departments,*banana cropping system in the PRA area including present or future control strategies, and*potential impacts (economic, social, environmental) in the PRA area. The Panel recognizes that X. campestris pv. musacearum is a recently emerging bacterium of banana and, therefore, most of the information regarding the taxonomy and host range of the bacterium and the epidemiology and impacts of the disease has been published subsequent to the date the document was compiled (July 2003). However, greater inference could have been made from information available on Ralstonia solanacearum race 2 (<b>Moko</b> <b>disease),</b> which appears to have a similar epidemiology and management strategies. The Panel notes that French Guiana, {{which is part of the}} PRA area in the document, is not mentioned in the assessor’s general conclusion. The Panel concludes that:*Under current regulations banning the import of banana host plant material, the entry of the pathogen into French Guiana, Guadeloupe and Martinique would be unlikely, whilst its probability would be higher for Réunion through uncontrolled/illegal trade and passengers transportation of banana and enset plant material, due to its geographic relative proximity to East Africa, where the pathogen is present and widespread. *If the current regulations were rescinded, the Panel considers that the market globalization would increase the probability of entry of the bacterium through trade of banana and enset vegetative propagation material and fruit originating from contaminated areas. *The widespread presence of the disease in East Africa increases the probability of entry of the bacterium into Réunion through local trade and tourism. Risk seems to be lower for the other three French overseas departments, which are located far from Africa. Due to the geographical distance, the probability of X. campestris pv. musacearum entering into the four French overseas departments via vectors, such as nectar- and/or fruit-feeding insects, birds or bats, is estimated as low. *The probability of entry of the bacterium into the French overseas departments by trade on commodities other than Ensete spp. and Musa spp. would be low, considering that the only other hosts (i. e. Canna orchoides, C. indica and maize) were reported under artificial inoculations. *In agreement with the document, should the bacterium enter the PRA area, the probability of establishment and spread would be high for all French overseas departments. *Within commercial plantations of dessert bananas the disease effects would be high in the absence of any control strategy, but they would be mitigated by the existing practices of bagging and de-budding. Sanitation and eradication would be necessary at extra costs and these costs might reduce the competitiveness of the banana industry in Guadeloupe and Martinique. As a result, employment might be reduced causing negative social impacts. *Plantain and cooking banana are an important staple food and a large fraction is household-produced. Since the disease is not readily controllable in smallholdings and family gardens, high yield losses and a potential disruption of subsistence production and consumption patterns would occur. This may also cause negative social impacts. There is uncertainty regarding the availability and the costs of substitution foods, should the yield of cooking banana and plantain be substantially reduced. Similar effects are envisaged for French Guiana, where the banana crop is an element of shifting cultivation. *The degree of uncertainty concerning the host range of the bacterium, its survival in soil and plant debris, its airborne vectors, the control strategies and the economic impact cannot be considered as low, as estimated in the document. The Panel considers those uncertainties as moderate due to the limited information available on the bacterium and on the disease, both in the document and in the literature. The Panel, based on the information provided in the document and on additional literature consulted, concludes that X. campestris pv. musacearum is appropriate for evaluation of pest risk management options for the endangered areas of Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion, as stated in the conclusion of the document, and the Panel reaches the same conclusion for French Guiana. Therefore, the panel concludes that X. campestris pv. musacearum is potentially eligible for addition to the list of harmful organisms in Directive 2000 / 29 /EC for all French overseas departments...|$|E
40|$|Existing plant {{protection}} regulations in the Caribbean {{are not only}} outdated but suffer {{from a lack of}} technical backup. That explains why over the last 25 years these islands have been menaced by many pests that have been introduced from other countries. Pillaging pirates and other outlaws have come back to threaten many countries in the Caribbean. They sneak in by boat or plane, evade customs officials, break into warehouses and rampage through their new found bounty before wreaking havoc with the lives of ordinary people throughout the islands. These modern day plunderers brandish no swords but, seen from close up, are no less menacing with their armour and built-in weapons. They are, in fact, insects, bacteria and diseases that despoil crops and harvests by attacking them on all fronts. To combat such pests, most countries have developed laws and implemented them with more or less effective regulations. It is in this area, however, that many Caribbean countries have fallen behind to the advantage of all sorts of persistent pests. It is not uncommon to see {{plant protection}} laws passed over a century ago still on the books. While they may include relatively complete regulations enabling the control of imported vegetation by various sanitation measures, including the destruction of infected shipments, for many islands this is no longer sufficient. Unfortunately, there acoears to be little initiative to update such laws. This leaves those responsible for their implementation a difficult task for which they are, at best, ill-prepared. In some cases, the lack of personnel and technical support means that only a token effort can be made to deal with the problem. The result in many countries is that plant protection measures boil down to a simple bureaucratic procedure: issuing certificates that simply delay exports. Grenada {{is a good example of}} the state of plant protection controls in the Caribbean. A law passed in 1891 gives authority to local officials to prohibit or restrict the import of plant material and to order any treatment judged necessary, but it has never been updated. If the situation is not this bad on all the islands, there are various loopholes through which many pests have passed on their way to establishing themselves as local problems. In recent years, some organizations (notably the Caribbean Plant Protection Commission - CPPC - of the FAO and the Regional Programme for Vegetation Protection of the Inter- American Institute for Agricultural Cooperation - IIAC) have made considerable efforts in this direction. Meetings and seminars at both the national and regional level have been organized in close cooperation with agricultural departments of different countries in order to promote better plant protection controls. Direct technical support has also been given to help update and enforce regulations. As a result of an IIAC study on phytosanitation measures in various Caribbean countries, a certain number of common problems have been identified: insufficent records, inexperienced personnel, outdated legislation, and a general lack of both material and staff. Some of these obstacles are now being overcome thanks to the various programmes noted above, but much remains to be done To deal effectively with this problem, one must first of all know how the pests in question arrive. Most of them are brought in on vegetable matter, notably live plants, fruit and grains. Studies in the Caribbean have identified three major vectors. The first is the use of exotic HYV seeds, seedlings, cuttings or tubers. The second is the importation of staple foods needed to complement the country's food supply deficit. Finally, there is the exchange of agricultural products within the region. Whether in the form of vegetable matter or another agricultural product, processed or not, all of these vectors run the risk of introducing serious plant diseases or infestations. Experience in some ACP countries has shown that, if properly applied, plant protection measures that are constantly revised to keep up with modern transmission patterns can reduce such risks. National measures, however, will never be enough to deal with these 'pests without borders'. We now know that effective international control measures must do more than try to keep pests out of uninfected countries. Attention must also be given to reducing the export of such problems. As with human health, sanitary measures must be taken on both sides: by protecting others, one protects oneself and by exporting only uninfected products, one reduces the likelihood of importing infected products in the future. This principle is particularly valid in the Caribbean where there is a constant flow of products between the islands. The lesson has been well learned in the Barbados, St. Vincent and Antigua. Unlike their neighbours, these countries have not suffered from an infestation of Anastrepha on fruit. In order for them to keep this pest out, they must ensure that control measures be taken beyond their borders. Their best allies are thus the inspection services of exporting countries which must be able to ensure that only uninfected products are shipped. Even in regions where such controls are adequate and applied effectively by all countries concerned, new pests have still been introduced. As recent studies have confirmed, the loopholes and poor enforcement of regulations are not the only cause for the failure of plant protection measures. Of the world's 350 or so major agricultural pests listed by the Commonwealth Institute of Entomology, more than 60 % have been introduced. This has led to the 'inevitability theory' which holds that 'all pests will eventually get to all parts of the world because phytosanitary controls can only retard their spread'. Unfortunately, some specialists are beginning to agree. For evidence, they cite the recent introduction of a citrus scab in Florida, a mango seed beetle in Guadeloupe, Martinique and St. Lucia, and the slow but steady spread northward of the African killer bee despite draconian protection measures. A recently discovered element also supports this thesis: it seems that natural vectors, such as winds, storms and ocean currents, also spread diseases and insects. Hurrican Allen, for example, is blamed for having introduced thrips (Fulmekiola serrate) into the Caribbean. Previously unknown in the region, it had disastrous effects on sugarcane plantations in Guadeloupe and the Barbados before moving on to Guyana and Trinidad. Another problem in Guyana's plantations is a smut disease whose spores appear to be carried by the wind over the Atlantic from West Africa. In this case, no number of laws or inspections would be effective. Even if after all precautionary measures have been taken some pests still manage to reach another country, the battle is far from over. One can still fight a rearguard action to stop them from spreading. It is at this point that good technical support can play a pivotal role. Unfortunately, few phytosanitary services in the Caribbean have access to such facilities. This shortcoming was primarily responsible for the spread of <b>moko</b> <b>disease</b> among bananas. Introduced to Grenada earlier this decade, it has resulted in over 2 million dollars worth of losses and poses enormous risks to the banana industry in the region. As the closest country, St. Vincent is at the greatest risk due to the fact that the Grenadine archipelago acts as a land bridge between the two larger islands. The lack of a good plant protection service was also responsible for the 1965 invasion of a sugarcane beetle (Diatraea centella) on the island of Abaco in the Bahamas. It was introduced by sugarcane seeds brought in from Guyana. An effective protection service could at least have avoided its spread once it was introduced. If it is easy to evaluate the losses caused by such pests, it is much harder to predict the economic impact of identified threats and thus to gauge the investment warranted to prevent their spread. The cruciferae moth (Plutella xylostella). for example, was discovered for the first time in Trinidad in 1945 but it caused little damage until 25 years later. The cherry beetle was first observed in coffee plantations in 1978 in Jamaica, but has not been noticed anywhere else. On the other hand, sugarcane smut and rust, identified in 1974 and 1978 respectively, spread like wildfire through all Caribbean sugarcane plantations as well as those in Central and South America. The best protection against such pests remains prevention. First of r all, every effort must be made to : stop them from leaving or entering countries. Once introduced, eradication and treatment measures are both complicated and very costly. It took no less than 27 months and 176 million dollars to control the 1980 Mediterranean fruitfly epidemic in California. It is thus easy to understand why the Barbados banned the import of mangoes from St. Lucia when mango seed beetles were discovered there in 1984. Many measures are now needed to improve plant protection in the Caribbean. The first seems to be better information. Whether designed to evaluate the risks of spreading pests through internal circulation or international commerce, studies of transmission methods will be very useful. Unfortunately, even basic data such as lists of existing pests in these countries is not always available. In addition to studies on the risks and modes of infestations, analyses of the economic impact of introduced pests are needed. Finally, it must be remembered that phytosanitary control personnel can only help to ensure the food security of their countries if they are given the necessary training and technical support.
