50|$|The male gametophytes, or microgametophytes, that {{participate}} in double fertilization are contained within pollen grains. They develop within the microsporangia, or pollen sacs, of the anthers on the stamens. Each microsporangium contains diploid microspore mother cells, or microsporocytes. Each <b>microsporocyte</b> undergoes meiosis, forming four haploid microspores, {{each of which}} can eventually develop into a pollen grain. A microspore undergoes mitosis and cytokinesis {{in order to produce}} two separate cells, the generative cell and the tube cell. These two cells in addition to the spore wall make up an immature pollen grain. As the male gametophyte matures, the generative cell passes into the tube cell, and the generative cell undergoes mitosis, producing two sperm cells. Once the pollen grain has matured, the anthers break open, releasing the pollen. The pollen is carried to the pistil of another flower, by wind or animal pollinators, and deposited on the stigma. As the pollen grain germinates, the tube cell produces the pollen tube, which elongates and extends down the long style of the carpel and into the ovary, where its sperm cells are released in the megagametophyte. Double fertilization proceeds from here.|$|E

At {{the onset of}} meiosis, microtubules (MTs) in fertile microsporocytes were short and anisotropically oriented in the <b>microsporocyte</b> cytoplasm. As the microsporocytes entered metaphase I, the MTs constructed a bisymmetrical spindle characterized by conspicuous kinetochore fibers closely associated with chromosomes in the medial plane. During anaphase I, interzonal MTs become conspicuous between {{the two sets of}} chromosomes and the polar regions become more distant as spindle MTs are depleted, essentially disappearing at telophase I. Radially distributed MTs increased and the <b>microsporocyte</b> entered meiosis II, producing two spindles at angles to one another within the wall of the <b>microsporocyte.</b> Indicative of the completion of anaphase II is the formation of a field of aligned MTs between two non-sister nuclei, after which the cytoplasm produced centripetal furrows, meeting {{in the center of the}} cell and dividing it into four microspores at the completion of cytokinesis. In sterile microsporocytes, however, an abnormal arrangement of MTs occurred at the conclusion of anaphase II. Although two spindles formed, the angle and the boundary between the spindles were not maintained. At the onset of telophase II, the two spindles migrated to a central region and laterally fused in irregular orientations in which the decondensing chromatin of the non-sister nuclei may form separate or merged nuclei, followed by irregular cytokinesis.

Analysis of the male-sterile mutant, tpd 1, showed that functional interruption of TPD 1 caused the precursors of tapetal cells to differentiate and develop into <b>microsporocytes</b> instead of tapetum.

Our previous studies revealed the presence of polyadenylated RNA (poly(A) RNA) in these bodies, but did not confirm the presence of nascent transcripts or splicing factors of the SR family. The lack of these molecules precludes the bodies from being the sites of synthesis and early maturation of primary transcripts (Kołowerzo et al., Protoplasma 236 : 13 – 19, 2009).

In angiosperms meiosis occurs during flower development, the duration of which varies widely among species and is affected by environmental conditions within species. For 36 species representing 13 angiosperm families, we determined the time at which meiosis ceased in the anthers as a fraction of the total time from floral primordium initiation (beginning of development) to flower opening (end). It was found that this fraction, rather than being continuously distributed among species, occurred in three discrete classes despite wide variations within and among species in absolute developmental durations. Each species was characterized by a single timing class. For all species within a given timing class, therefore, the durations before and after the end of <b>microsporocyte</b> meiosis existed in constant ratio. Each timing class was found in phylogenetically distant species; conversely, a plant family often contained more than one class.

From the circumferentially distributed microtubule bundle network some microtubule bundles radiated towards the conical region of the cell. The <b>microsporocyte</b> after Meiosis Ⅰ became a dyad. In the dyad cell microtubule bundles emanated radially from the nucleus. In the cortex of the dyad cell some of the microtubule bundles became randomly oriented. The dyad then underwent Meiosis Ⅱ to become tetrad. Microtubule bundles in the tetrad cell radiated from the nucleus. No randomly oriented microtubule bundles were present in the cortical region of the tetrad cell. Mter- wards the four cells that made up the tetrad dissociated from each other and each became a microspore. At the early stage of the microspore development most of the microtubule bundles were randomly distributed. Later, some of the microtubules converged towards a bud-like cytoplasmic protrusion. This bud-like protrusion later developed into a germ pore (or pollen pore). At the late stage of microspore formation, microtubule bundles became thinner and reticulately oriented to form a tightly knitted network. 對水稻(Oryza saiva L.) 小孢子發育過程中微管變化的研究表明，微管在小孢子不同發育階段呈 現多樣性。在花粉母細胞內，微管形成許多粗束和分支，圍繞著核分佈形成一個網絡。花粉母細胞經第一次減數分裂形成二分體。在每一個二分體細胞內，有許多微管束，從核週輻射至細胞質各部位;在細胞質存在一個疏鬆的微管束網絡。二分體經第二次減數分裂形成四分體，在每一個四分體細胞內，微管束呈輻射狀，從核膜輻射入細胞質內。四分體形成後不久，四分體的四個細胞便分開，每一個細胞變成一個獨立的小孢子。在早期的小孢子細胞內，微管束呈疏鬆網狀分佈。其中有些微管束朝向胞質一個小突起聚集。當小子包子進入中期發育階段，在胞質的小突起部位微管束密度增大。小突起最終形成為萌發孔。當小孢子發育至成熟期，細胞內的微管束變得纖細，而網絡則變得緊密。之後的發育階段(即花粉發育不同階段) 因熒光標記難以進入細胞，元法獲得清晰的圖像。link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E

Scanning electron microscopy examination showed that exine pattern formation in the mutant is impaired, as sporopollenin is randomly deposited on the pollen surface. Transmission electron microscopy examination further revealed that the primexine formation of mutant microspores is aberrant at the tetrad stage, which leads to defective sporopollenin deposition on microspores and the locule wall.

As has been shown, the chromatin migrating between cells in cytomixis is neither selectively heterochromatized nor degraded both before its migration to another cell and after it enters a recipient cell as micronuclei. We also showed that cytomictic chromatin contains marks typical for transcriptionally active chromatin as well as heterochromatin. Moreover, marks typical for chromosome condensation, synaptonemal complex formation and key proteins required for the formation of bivalents were also detected at migrated chromatin...|$|R
40|$|Functional pollen {{is needed}} to {{successfully}} complete fertilization. Pollen is formed inside the anthers following a specific sequence of developmental stages, from <b>microsporocyte</b> meiosis to pollen release, that concerns microsporocytes/microspores and anther wall tissues. The processes involved may not be synchronous within a flower, an anther, and even a microsporangium. Asynchrony has been barely analyzed, and its biological consequences have not been yet assessed. In this review, different processes of pollen development and lifetime, stressing on the possible consequences of their differential timing on pollen performance, are summarized. Development is usually synchronized until <b>microsporocyte</b> meiosis I (occasionally until meiosis II). Afterwards, a period of mostly asynchronous events extends up to anther opening as regards: (1) meiosis II (sometimes); (2) microspore vacuolization and later reduction of vacuoles; (3) amylogenesis, amylolysis, and carbohydrate inter-conversion; (4) the first haploid mitosis; and (5) intine formation. Asynchrony would promote metabolic differences among developing microspores and therefore physiologically heterogeneous pollen grains within a single microsporangium. Asynchrony would increase the effect of competition for resources during development and pollen tube growth and also for water during (re) hydration on the stigma. The differences generated by developmental asynchronies may have an adaptive role since more efficient pollen grains would be selected with regard to homeostasis, desiccation tolerance, resilience, speed of (re) hydration, and germination. The performance of each pollen grain which landed onto the stigma will {{be the result of}} a series of selective steps determined by its development, physiological state at maturity, and successive environmental constrains...|$|E
40|$|Flowering plants form male {{reproductive}} cells (microsporocytes) during sporophytic generation, which subsequently differentiate into multicellular male gametes in the gametophytic generation. The tapetum is a somatic helper tissue neighboring microsporocytes {{and supporting}} gametogenesis. The mechanism controlling the specification of the tapetum and <b>microsporocyte</b> cell fate within the anther {{has long been}} a mystery in biology. Recent investigations have revealed molecular switches and signaling pathways underlying the establishment of somatic and reproductive cells in plants. In this review we discuss common and diversified signaling molecules and regulatory pathways including receptor-like protein kinases, redox status, glycoprotein, transcription factors, hormones and microRNA implicated in the specification of tapetum and microsporocytes in plants.

30|$|Cohesin complex {{proteins}} {{are essential}} for sister chromatid cohesion and proper chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis. Cohesin proteins are also components of axial elements (AEs) and lateral elements (LEs) of the synaptonemal complex during meiosis. The cytological behavior of four cohesin proteins (SMC 1, SMC 3, SCC and REC 8 /SYN 1), assessed by immunofluorescence during prophase I in tomato <b>microsporocyte</b> revealed that the four cohesins are distributed unevenly and are not co-located along the AE/LEs in diplotene (Qiao et al. [2011]). Nevertheless, based on current models of the cohesin complex, these proteins must be present {{at the same time}} and place in equivalent amounts. These results indicate that cohesin proteins studied can form different complexes and/or perform additional functions during meiosis in plants.|$|E
50|$|In heterosporous {{seedless}} vascular plants, modified leaves called microsporophylls bear microsporangia containing many <b>microsporocytes</b> that undergo meiosis, each producing four microspores. Each microspore {{may develop}} into a male gametophyte consisting of a somewhat spherical antheridium within the microspore wall. Either 128 or 256 sperm cells with flagella are produced in each antheridium. The only heterosporous ferns are aquatic or semi-aquatic, including the genera Marsilea,Regnellidium, Pilularia, Salvinia, and Azolla. Heterospory is also known in the lycopod genus Selaginella and in the quillwort genus Isoëtes.|$|R
40|$|Flowers, microsporogenesis and microgametogenesis of Excentrodendron hsienmu in opening-functional {{flowers and}} non-opening flowers were studied to {{investigate}} the evolutionary relationships of Excentrodendron. E. hsienmu is a dioecious species that blossoms every 3 - 4 years, although large numbers of flower buds develop every year. The anther is tetrasporangiate, the tapetum is of the secretory type, the microspore tetrads are mainly tetrahedral, and the pollen grains are two-celled when shed. Four to six <b>microsporocytes</b> are seen on the transverse section of the anthers, and cytokinesis is simultaneous. The development of the anther wall conforms to the basic type and the anther wall is five or six cells thick, with a fibrous endothecium. The difference between the opening-functional and the non-opening flowers is mainly in {{the thickness of the}} anther wall. Early megasporogenesis in staminate flowers up to megaspore mother cell or megaspore tetrads has been observed. Excentrodendron shares with Dombeyeae only plesiomorphic features, but differs in anther wall development type and thickness. Most features of Excentrodendron are shared with Pterospermum, including such synapomorphic features as basic type of anther wall development, five- to six-cell-thick anther wall, biseriate tapetum at some places, and degeneration of <b>microsporocytes,</b> suggesting placement near Pterospermum.

40|$|In {{angiosperm}} ovules and anthers, the hypodermal {{cell layer}} provides the progenitors of meiocytes. We have previously {{reported that the}} multiple archesporial cells 1 (mac 1) mutation identifies a gene that {{plays an important role}} in the switch of the hypodermal cells from the vegetative pathway to the meiotic (sporogenous) pathway in maize ovules. Here we report that the mac 1 mutation alters the developmental fate of the hypodermal cells of the maize anther. In a normal anther a hypodermal cell divides periclinally with the inner cell giving rise to the sporogenous archesporial cells while the outer cell, together with adjacent cells, forms the primary parietal layer. The cells of the parietal layer then undergo two cycles of periclinal divisions to give rise to three wall layers. In mac 1 anthers the primary parietal layer usually fails to divide periclinally so that the three wall layers do not form, while the archesporial cells divide excessively and most fail to form <b>microsporocytes.</b> The centrally located mutant <b>microsporocytes</b> are abnormal in appearance and in callose distribution and they fail to proceed through meiosis. These failures in development and function appear to reflect the failure of mac 1 gene function in the hypodermal cells and their cellular progeny...|$|R
