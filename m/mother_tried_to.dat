Oswald was born ten months after his brother's death. His younger sisters were Adele (1881–1917), Gertrud (1882–1957), and Hildegard (1885–1942).|$|E
25|$|William Scranton {{was born}} on July 19, 1917 while the Scranton family was on {{vacation}} at a cottage in Madison, Connecticut. He {{was the son of}} Worthington Scranton, a wealthy Pennsylvania businessman, and Marion Margery (Warren) Scranton, a member of the Republican National Committee for over two decades. Despite her own involvement in politics, his <b>mother</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> dissuade him from entering politics because of his childhood struggles with asthma.

25|$|As a child, Khurram {{received}} a broad education befitting {{his status as}} a Mughal prince, which included martial training and exposure {{to a wide variety of}} cultural arts, such as poetry and music, most of which was inculcated, according to court chroniclers, by Akbar and Ruqaiya. In 1605, as Akbar lay on his deathbed, Khurram, who at this point was 13, remained by his bedside and refused to move even after his <b>mother</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> retrieve him. Given the politically uncertain times immediately preceding Akbar's death, Khurram was in a fair amount of physical danger of harm by political opponents of his father, and his conduct at this time can be understood as a precursor to the bravery that he would later be known for.|$|E
25|$|The Crown Princess, however, was not {{so lucky}} with the {{marriage}} plans for her daughter Viktoria. In 1881 {{she fell in love}} with Prince Alexander I of Bulgaria and her <b>mother</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> obtain permission from the Emperor for the engagement. Despite being a sovereign, the Bulgarian prince was born of a morganatic marriage, which placed him in a position of inferiority in front of the proud House of Hohenzollern. In addition, Alexander's policy in his Principality of Bulgaria was greatly disliked by Russia, a traditional ally of Prussia. Bismarck feared that marriage between a German princess and an enemy of Tsar Alexander II of Russia would represent a blow to the League of the Three Emperors, i.e. the Austro-German-Russian alliance. The Chancellor, in the meanwhile, gained the disapproval of William I to the union, much to the dismay of Victoria and Frederick.|$|E

Mick leaves the hospital angry after Stan asks to stay at The Vic, but Tina is angry to find out that Stan is in hospital and Mick has not told her.

25|$|In 1175, {{the emperor}} was seriously ill {{and decided to}} entrust the regentship of his son Lý Long Trát to Tô Hiến Thành. The regent was {{appointed}} to the position of chancellor of the Lý Dynasty (Thái phó bình chương quân quốc trọng sự) and granted the title Prince (Vương) — an unprecedented act of a Lý emperor for a title that was reserved exclusively for members of the royal family. During the Lý Dynasty, Tô Hiến Thành was the only possessor of the title Prince who did not come from the Lý royal family. From the fourth month of 1175, Tô Hiến Thành began his regency because the emperor was not able to rule the country as the crown prince was only two years old. The emperor died in the seventh month in 1175 and began the campaign of the Empress Mother in supporting another prince, Lý Long Xưởng, to replace the infant emperor Lý Long Trát, now Lý Cao Tông. The Empress <b>Mother</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> bribe Tô Hiến Thành's wife and persuaded the regent many times. Tô Hiến Thành refused by a simple answer that he had to follow the order of the late emperor and preferred being honest to being rich but disloyal. His firmness in refusing the proposal of the Empress Mother and controlling the army and order during the funeral time made other officials believe in Lý Cao Tông. They therefore declined the campaign of replacing him by the prince Lý Long Xưởng.|$|E
