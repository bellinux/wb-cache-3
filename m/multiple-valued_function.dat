5000|$|Branch points {{fall into}} three broad categories: {{algebraic}} branch points, transcendental branch points, and logarithmic branch points. Algebraic branch points most commonly arise from functions {{in which there}} is an ambiguity in the extraction of a root, such as solving the equation w2 [...] = z for w as a function of z. Here the branch point is the origin, because the analytic continuation of any solution around a closed loop containing the origin will result in a different function: there is non-trivial monodromy. Despite the algebraic branch point, the function w is well-defined as a <b>multiple-valued</b> <b>function</b> and, in an appropriate sense, is continuous at the origin. This is in contrast to transcendental and logarithmic branch points, that is, points at which a <b>multiple-valued</b> <b>function</b> has nontrivial monodromy and an essential singularity. In geometric function theory, unqualified use of the term branch point typically means the former more restrictive kind: the algebraic branch points. [...] In other areas of complex analysis, the unqualified term may also refer to the more general branch points of transcendental type.|$|E

It {{is shown}} in this paper that a model of multiple-valued logic over the field of complex numbers is the most {{appropriate}} for {{the representation of the}} genetic code as a <b>multiple-valued</b> <b>function.</b> The genetic code is considered as a partially defined <b>multiple-valued</b> <b>function</b> of three variables.

A covering problem is solved wherein a set of primes with minimal cost is selected to obtain a Boolean factorization. This method can exploit Boolean identities in factorization such as a 1 a = 0 and a 1 a = a.
