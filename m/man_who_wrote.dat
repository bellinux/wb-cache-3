The identity of Fernández de Avellaneda {{has been the subject}} of many theories, but there is no consensus on who he was. One theory holds that Avellaneda’s work was a collaboration by friends of Lope de Vega. Another theory is that it was by Gerónimo de Passamonte, the real-life inspiration for the character Ginés de Pasamonte of Part I.|$|E
25|$|One afternoon, while Marjory and Archibald are at Castle Crom {{looking at}} the Spanish documents, the {{landlord}} of the castle arrives and interrupts them. This landlord is a Spaniard named Don Bernardino—the descendant of the <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>wrote</b> the documents. He is astounded that Archibald has possession of the documents and asks that Archibald return the documents to their proper place and not disturb them again. Archibald and Marjory nonetheless decide to continue looking for the treasure, which they find (with some danger) in the cave under Archibald's house. Don Bernardino and Archibald almost have a duel over this newfound treasure, but decide against it. Meanwhile, Marjory goes missing.|$|E

This sparked some {{concern in the}} gay community that many teenagers had downloaded the content and would be outed by the lawsuit. Some had worried that outed gay teenagers would be prone to suicide. Fisher disputed this, saying that in all their legal dealings, none had ever led to a teenage suicide. Initially Fisher offered amnesty to internet users who came forward and admitted they downloaded content illegally. They could settle with Fisher by paying a one time $1000 fee. Fisher described the people who downloaded the content as thieves. The suit also claims that any reasonable internet user would secure their router {{and those who did}} not and allowed content to be downloaded through their IP address were also guilty of copyright infringement. Fisher also sued a Swedish <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>wrote</b> a satirical email to them, admitting he had downloaded Fisher's content but told him the money would be paid out of a pot of gold he received from a leprechaun at the end of the rainbow. Fisher sued the man and subpoenaed his Google gmail account information including IP address.|$|E

500|$|On August 5, Yankovic {{recorded}} [...] "Here's Johnny", {{a parody}} of [...] "Who's Johnny" [...] by El DeBarge. The song, a loving ode to The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson announcer Ed McMahon, features John Roarke of the television series Fridays fame doing an impression of McMahon's voice. According to Yankovic, Peter Wolf, the <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>wrote</b> [...] "Who's Johnny", enjoyed the parody idea {{so much that he}} personally brought the floppy disc program that had all the synthesizer parts for the original song into the studio when Yankovic was recording his parody. The final parody recorded for the album was [...] "Toothless People", a play on Mick Jagger's [...] "Ruthless People", which was recorded on August 29, 1986. The song, about elderly people who are missing their teeth, was written after Yankovic heard it would be the theme to the 1986 film Ruthless People. Assuming the song would be a hit, Yankovic requested and received permission from Jagger to record a parody version. [...] When Jagger's song failed to crack the Top 40, Yankovic considered not recording his version, but because Jagger had [...] "authorized" [...] the parody, he decided failing to produce it would be an insult to the artist. Therefore, he recorded the spoof anyway.|$|E
500|$|After {{publishing}} two novels, Dead Men Tell No Tales in 1899 and Peccavi in 1900, Hornung {{published a}} second collection of Raffles stories, The Black Mask, in 1901. The nearly broke Manders is told {{to apply for}} the post of a nurse to an elderly invalid, who then reveals himself to be Raffles, who, as Manders describes, had [...] "aged twenty years; he looked fifty at the very least. His hair was white; there was no trick about that; and his face was another white. The lines about the corners of the eyes and mouth were both many and deep". In the final story of the collection, [...] "The Knees of the Gods", Raffles and Manders enlist in the army to fight in the Second Boer War; the story closes with Manders wounded and Raffles killed. The critics again complained about the criminal aspect; The Spectator declared [...] "this sort of book presents crime in a form too entertaining and attractive to be moral", while the reviewer for The Illustrated London News thought that Hornung's [...] "invention has obviously flagged... It is laughable, in a sense which the author never intended, to hear these burglars rant about the honour of Old England. It is a pity that the <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>wrote</b> Peccavi should stoop to this".|$|E

2500|$|A major {{disagreement}} among critics {{relates to}} Urmuz's ambiguous positioning, between literature, antiliterature and metafiction. In {{reference to the}} Bizarre Pages, Crohmălniceanu introduced the term [...] "antiprose". In Crohmălniceanu's view, the antiliterary [...] "device" [...] Urmuz invented is impersonal and regulated, {{in the manner of}} Dada [...] "readymades", but as such ingenious and therefore inimitable. Authors such as Adrian Marino, Eugen Negrici, Lucian Raicu and Mircea Scarlat have spoken about Urmuz as a revolutionist of language, who liberated texts from coherence and even semantics; whereas others—Livius Ciocârlie, Radu Petrescu, Ion Pop, Nicolae Manolescu, Marin Mincu, Mihai Zamfir—have regarded him as mainly a textualist, interested in reusing and redefining the limits of poetry or narration, but creating a coherent, if personal, universe. According to Vasile Andru, Urmuzian literature is by definition open to all these associations, its antiliterary aspects illustrating the modern gap between [...] "nature and nurture". Critic C. Trandafir, who sees Urmuz's apparent textualism as canceled out by deeper meanings in his prose, writes: [...] "The <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>wrote</b> the 'bizarre pages' had a clear critical awareness of the transformations needed within literary discourse." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1872 she {{permanently}} {{retired from}} the stage with four performances of [...] "Fidalma" [...] in Cimarosa's Il matrimonio segreto, at the Paris Théâtre des Italiens but, in fact, she never gave up singing in private and in benefit concerts. When in 1887 the French and Italian Governments agreed upon moving the mortal remains of Rossini into the Basilica di Santa Croce in Florence, Alboni, then a sixty-one-year-old lady living in seclusion, wrote to the Italian Foreign Minister, Di Robilant, proposing that the Petite Messe Solennelle, [...] "the last musical composition by Rossini", be performed in Santa Croce {{the day of the}} funeral, and [...] "demanding the honour, as an Italian and a pupil of the immortal Maestro," [...] of singing it herself in her [...] "dear and beloved homeland". Her wish, however, never came true and she was just given the chance of being present at the exhumation ceremony in Paris. The Paris correspondent of the Rome newspaper Il Fanfulla wrote on the occasion: [...] "photographers snapped in the same shot the greatest performer of Cenerentola and Semiramide, and what is left of the <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>wrote</b> these masterpieces".|$|E
2500|$|Griffith—indignant at the film's {{negative}} critical reception—wrote {{letters to}} newspapers and published a pamphlet {{in which he}} accused his critics of censoring unpopular opinions. [...] Griffith's 1916 pamphlet The Rise and Fall of a Free Speech in America used racialized language and images, such as a cartoon that depicted [...] "censorship" [...] as a monstrous black man with a lascivious {{expression on his face}} eyeing [...] "free speech" [...] who appeared as a white woman dressed in a white dress. [...] "Free Speech" [...] points at [...] "Censorship" [...] and says: [...] "All history, all reason condemns you: GO!". In his pamphlet, Griffith called censorship [...] "this malignant pygmy" [...] who had mutated into a fully grown [...] "Caliban" [...] (a character from William Shakespeare's play The Tempest who is often depicted as a black man). When Sherwin Lewis of The New York Globe wrote a piece that expressed criticism of the film's distorted portrayal of history and said that it was not worthy of constitutional protection because its purpose was to make a few [...] "dirty dollars", Griffith responded that [...] "the public should not be afraid to accept the truth, even though it might not like it". He also added that the <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>wrote</b> the editorial was [...] "damaging my reputation as a producer" [...] and [...] "a liar and a coward". He conceived his next film, Intolerance (1916), as a response to those who had criticized his film.|$|E

2500|$|Wilson avoided {{standard}} rock percussion {{because he}} wanted his productions to sound more [...] "delicate" [...] and less [...] "boomy". Van Dyke Parks said: [...] "The first thing I can remember in the studio was how Brian used tuneful percussion, like a piano or a Chinese gong. Even a triangle has pitch. Brian was very fond of pitched instruments. They {{reminded me of the}} orchestrations of the early 20th century done by people like Percy Grainger, the <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>wrote</b> 'Country Gardens', who was infatuated with tuneful percussion. He stood out in my youth as a great composer because of what he did with sound, and Brian was doing that." [...] Arranger Paul Mertens believes: [...] "There are string sections on Pet Sounds. But to me, what's special about that is not that Brian was trying to introduce classical music into rock & roll. Rather, {{he was trying to get}} classical musicians to play like rock musicians. He's using these things to make music in the way that he understood, rather than trying to appropriate the orchestra. Often he'll direct a drummer to play in a very unconventional way, in a way that drummers don't normally play. He'll say, 'No, no, don't play the hi-hat, just go bomp...ba-domp...bomp...ba-domp on the tom and kick drum.' He's feeling a certain thing, but coming at it from a musical idea rather than the conventions of the instrument." [...] One of Wilson's favorite techniques was to apply reverb exclusively to a timpani, as can be heard in [...] "Wouldn't It Be Nice", [...] "You Still Believe in Me", and [...] "Don't Talk".|$|E
2500|$|His {{increasing}} {{reputation as}} both performer and improviser {{continued to make}} Franck much in demand for inaugural or dedicatory recitals of new or rebuilt Cavaillé-Coll organs: Louis James Alfred Lefébure-Wély's new instrument at Saint-Sulpice (1862) and later for organs at Notre-Dame, Saint-Étienne-du-Mont, and La Trinité; {{for some of these}} instruments, Franck had acted (by himself or with Camille Saint-Saëns) as consultant. [...] At his own church, people began to come to hear the improvisations for the Mass and the Office. [...] In addition, Franck began to give [...] "organ-concerts" [...] or recitals at Sainte-Clotilde of his own works and those of other composers. [...] Perhaps his most notable concert arose from the attendance at a Sunday Mass in April 1866 of Franz Liszt, who sat in the choir to listen to Franck's improvisations and afterward said [...] "How could I ever forget the <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>wrote</b> those trios?" [...] To which Franck is supposed to have murmured a little sadly, [...] "I fancy I have done rather better things since then.". [...] Liszt organized a concert at Sainte-Clotilde to promote Franck's organ works later that month, which was well received by its listeners and well reported in the musical journals. [...] Despite his comment about the trios, Franck was pleased to hear that not only Liszt but Hans von Bülow was including them in concerts in Germany on a regular basis. [...] Franck reinforced his understanding of German organ music and how it should be played by hearing Anton Bruckner at Notre-Dame in 1869. [...] He began to have a regular circle of pupils, who were there ostensibly for organ study but showed increasing interest in Franck's compositional techniques.|$|E
