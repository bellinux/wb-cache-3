5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1967 the Carry On {{producer}} Peter Rogers assembled the cast for the 15th film of the series, Carry On Doctor. Rogers initially chose Joan Sims {{to play the role}} of the hospital <b>matron</b> but she declined the part, stating that Jacques's performance of the role in Carry On Nurse could not be bettered. As such, Rogers cast Jacques as <b>Matron,</b> with Sims accepting a smaller role as the timid assistant of the film's lead character Francis Bigger, played by Frankie Howerd. Jacques's screen time was increased from Carry On Nurse, as the producers considered her part to be an extension of the earlier role. Carry On Doctor was released in December of that year, to much success.|$|E
40|$|This study {{contributes}} to research examining how professional autonomy and hierarchy impacts upon {{the implementation of}} policy designed {{to improve the quality}} of public services delivery through the introduction of new managerial roles. It is based on an empirical examination of a new role for nurses – modern <b>matrons</b> – who are expected by policy-makers to drive organizational change aimed at tackling health care acquired infections (HCAI) in the National Health Service (NHS) within England. First, we show that the changing role of nurses associated with their ongoing professionalization limits the influence of modern <b>matrons</b> over their own ranks in tackling HCAI. Second, the influence of modern <b>matrons</b> over doctors is limited. Third, government policy itself appears inconsistent in its support for the role of modern <b>matrons.</b> The attempts of modern <b>matrons</b> to tackle HCAI appear more effective where infection control activity is situated in professional practice and where modern <b>matrons</b> integrate aspirations for improved infection control within mainstream audit mechanisms in a health care organization...|$|R
5000|$|The civil jury of <b>matrons</b> {{was used}} to {{determine}} whether a recently widowed woman was pregnant with what was presumed to be her late husband’s child. Such a pregnancy could delay or prevent the late husband’s property from passing to his father or brother, if he died without male heirs. Civil <b>matrons</b> juries were composed of twelve knights and twelve <b>matrons,</b> summoned by a writ de ventre inspiciendo ("to inspect the belly"). [...] Civil juries of <b>matrons</b> appear to have largely died out {{by the turn of the}} 19th century and became obsolete with the Married Women's Property Act 1882.|$|R
50|$|The {{governing}} body had 39 members: 20 doctors and 19 <b>matrons</b> and assistant <b>matrons,</b> mostly from fever hospitals and {{some from the}} hospitals run by the Metropolitan Asylums Board. Susan Villiers (nurse) was a member.|$|R
5|$|The larger workhouses had {{separate}} {{dining rooms}} {{for males and}} females; workhouses without separate dining rooms would stagger the meal times to avoid any contact between the sexes. Rations provided for the indoor staff were {{much the same as}} those for the paupers, although more generous. The master and <b>matron,</b> for instance, received six times the amount of food given to a pauper.|$|E
5|$|A large workhouse such as Whitechapel, {{accommodating}} {{several thousand}} paupers, employed {{a staff of}} almost 200; the smallest may only have had a porter and perhaps an assistant nurse {{in addition to the}} master and <b>matron.</b> A typical workhouse accommodating 225 inmates had a staff of five, which included a part-time chaplain and a part-time medical officer. The low pay meant that many medical officers were young and inexperienced. To add to their difficulties, in most unions they were obliged to pay out of their own pockets for any drugs, dressings or other medical supplies needed to treat their patients.|$|E
5|$|Besides the director, a <b>matron,</b> {{business}} manager and dietitian staffed a typical camp. An educational director {{was responsible for}} creating recreational, social and educational programs for the men. Church history, Bible and first aid were standard course topics. The strength of instructional programs varied from camp to camp, and after nine hours of physical labor, it could be difficult to motivate the men to attend classes. Most camps had libraries, some showed current films and camp number 56 (Camp Angel) near Waldport, Oregon had a particular emphasis on the arts. Camps produced newsletters and yearbooks documenting their experiences.|$|E

5|$|The Australian Voluntary Hospital was {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Colonel William L'Estrange Eames, {{an officer in}} the Australian Army Medical Corps who had served in the Second Boer War, and was holidaying in England with his family at the time. He was unable to join the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), which was not accepting enlistments outside of Australia. He was granted the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel in the Royal Army Medical Corps. Ida Greaves, from Royal Newcastle Hospital, was appointed <b>matron.</b> The hospital soon reached a strength of 120 staff, of whom 36 were nurses.|$|E
5|$|The {{apprenticeship}} {{was approved}} by the governors of the orphanage on 30 June 1769; Day and Bicknell collected Sabrina on 17 August. She was brought to lodgings in London, where she met Edgeworth for the first time. Day changed her name to Sabrina Sidney: Sabrina, the Latin name for the River Severn, which her orphanage overlooked; and Sidney after Algernon Sidney, one of Day's heroes. Day became a benefactor, and subsequently governor, of the Foundling Hospital, and on 20 September 1769 he chose another girl for his experiment, renaming her Lucretia after the Roman <b>matron.</b>|$|E
5|$|Two further Carry On films {{followed}} for Jacques in 1972: Carry On <b>Matron,</b> {{for which she}} was engaged in the title role, and Carry On Abroad, as Floella, the fiery Spanish cook at a half-finished hotel. As well as the film being Charles Hawtrey's last, it also marked a reduction in Jacques's screen time; she spent only one week filming her scenes. During post-production, the film's insurers became concerned about Jacques's deteriorating health. In {{a letter to the}} series producer Peter Rogers, they expressed their reluctance to insure her on set in any future film.|$|E

5|$|After {{three years}} of dating, they {{eventually}} decided to marry while discussing {{the issue in the}} couple's favorite booth at Chasen's, a restaurant in Beverly Hills. They married on March 4, 1952, at the Little Brown Church in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles, in a simple and hastily arranged ceremony designed to avoid the press. The only people in attendance were fellow actor William Holden (the best man) and his wife, actress Brenda Marshall (the <b>matron</b> of honor). Nancy was already pregnant during the ceremony; the couple's first child, Patricia Ann Reagan (later better known by her professional name, Patti Davis), was born less than eight months later on October 21, 1952. Their son, Ronald Prescott Reagan (later better known as Ron Reagan) was born six years later on May 20, 1958. Reagan also became stepmother to Maureen Reagan (1941–2001) and Michael Reagan (born 1945), the daughter and adopted son of her husband's first marriage to Jane Wyman.|$|E
5|$|Although Clement {{spent only}} six years {{serving as an}} umpire on a regular basis, she {{continued}} to serve intermittently until her forties. Following her time as a regularly serving umpire, Amanda Clement spent several years teaching physical education at the University of Wyoming, the Jamestown, North Dakota high school, and other schools in North Dakota and South Dakota. Clement also managed several Y.W.C.A.s, including one in LaCrosse, Wisconsin. Clement also served as the coach of Hudson Independent basketball team, organized tennis tournaments, {{and served as a}} newspaper reporter, police <b>matron,</b> typesetter, justice of the peace, and as the city assessor for the town of Hudson. In 1929 Clement moved back to South Dakota to care for her mother, who was ill. Following her mother's death in 1934, Clement moved to Sioux Falls, South Dakota where she spent twenty-five years as a social worker before retiring in 1966. Clement died in Sioux Falls on July 20, 1971.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, other doctors were also experimenting with gland transplantation, {{including}} Serge Voronoff, {{who had become}} known for grafting monkey testicles into men. In 1920, Voronoff demonstrated his technique before several other doctors {{at a hospital in}} Chicago, at which Brinkley showed up uninvited. Though Brinkley was barred at the door, his appearance elevated his profile in the press, which eventually resulted in his own demonstration at a hospital in Chicago. Brinkley transplanted goat testicles into 34 patients, including a judge, an alderman, a society <b>matron</b> and the chancellor of the now-defunct Chicago Law School (not {{to be confused with the}} University of Chicago Law School), all while the press looked on. His public profile grew, and his gland business in Milford continued at a brisk pace.|$|E
5|$|Recalling her {{inability}} to help the wounded people whom she saw during the Second World War, Hsu {{decided to become a}} nurse. As she was overaged at 47, she wrote a request to the chief <b>matron</b> of the Nursing Council in London. Touched by Hsu's sincerity and dedication, her application was accepted. She spent eight years in England doing nursing and another eight in Paraguay {{as a member of the}} German charity group Bruderhof, to start hospitals and homes for the aged there. In her mid-50s, she decided to return home to Penang to be with her mother. In Malaysia, she assisted her brother in starting the Assunta Foundation for the Poor in Ipoh.

5|$|Having {{seen the}} concerto delle donne in Ferrara, Caccini created a rival group {{made up of}} his family and a pupil. This {{ensemble}} was sponsored by the Medici, and traveled as far abroad as Paris to perform for Marie de' Medici. Francesca Caccini had much success composing and singing {{in the style of the}} concerto delle donne. Beginning in 1585, rival groups were created in Florence by the Medici, Rome by the Orsini, and Mantua by the Gonzaga. There was even a rival group in Ferrara based in the Castello Estense, the very palace where the concerto delle donne performed. This group was formed by Alfonso's sister Lucrezia d'Este, Duchess of Urbino. She had lived at the Este court since 1576, and shortly after Margherita's marriage to Alfonso in 1579, Alfonso and his henchmen killed Lucrezia's lover. Lucrezia was unhappy about being replaced as the <b>matron</b> of the house by Margherita, and upset by the murder of her lover, leading to her desire to be separate from the rest of her family during her evening entertainments.|$|E

5|$|The Waleses made Sandringham House their {{preferred}} residence, with Marlborough House their London base. Biographers agree that their marriage {{was in many}} ways a happy one; however, some have asserted that Albert Edward did not give his wife as much attention as she would have liked and that they gradually became estranged, until his attack of typhoid fever (the disease which was believed to have killed his father) in late 1871 brought about a reconciliation. This is disputed by others, who point out Alexandra's frequent pregnancies throughout this period and use family letters to deny the existence of any serious rift. Nevertheless, the prince was severely criticised from many quarters of society for his apparent lack of interest in her very serious illness with rheumatic fever. Throughout their marriage Albert Edward continued to keep company with other women, including the actress Lillie Langtry; Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick; humanitarian Agnes Keyser; and society <b>matron</b> Alice Keppel. Alexandra knew about most of these relationships, and later permitted Alice Keppel to visit the king as he lay dying. Alexandra herself remained faithful throughout her marriage.|$|E

40|$|Aim  To compare {{community}} <b>matrons</b> {{with other}} nurses carrying out case management for impact on service use and costs. Background  In England, nurses working in general practice, as district nurses and disease-specific nurses, undertake use case management. Community <b>matrons</b> {{were introduced to}} case management to reduce unplanned hospitalizations of people with complex conditions. Methods  Managers in three Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) identified four nurses/matrons engaged in case management. Nurses/matrons recruited five community-dwelling patients referred to them for case management. Patients reported use of health/social services for 9  months, 2008 to 2009. Nurses/matrons completed activity diaries. Results  Service use data were available for 33 patients. Compared with other nurse case managers, community <b>matrons</b> had: smaller caseloads; more patient contact time (mean 364 vs. 80  minutes per patient per month); and older patients (mean age 81 vs. 75  years, P =  0. 03) taking more medications (mean 8. 9 vs. 5. 6, P =  0. 014). Monthly costs were significantly higher for patients managed by community <b>matrons</b> (add £ 861), and who lived alone (add £ 696). Hospitalizations were not associated with patient or service delivery factors. Conclusion  Further research on cost-effectiveness of case management models is required. Implications for Nursing Management  The case for continued investment in community <b>matrons</b> remains to be proven...|$|R
