40|$|It {{has been}} known since the 1930 s that the dorsal fin is induced by the {{underlying}} neural crest. The inducer of the ventral fin, however, has remained elusive. We have investigated {{the source of the}} inducer of the ventral fin in Xenopus and show that it is the ventral mesoderm and not the neural crest. This induction takes place during mid-neurula stages and is completed by late neurulation. In terms of cell composition, the dorsal fin mesenchyme core arises from neural crest cells, while the mesenchyme of the ventral fin has a dual origin. The ventral fin contains neural crest cells that <b>migrate</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> the dorsal side of the embryo, but a contribution is also made by cells from the ventral mesoderm.

40|$|With a {{changing}} climate, {{we can expect}} higher temperatures and more precipitation in Sweden. As the temperature increases, new weed species are expected to <b>migrate</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> more southerly latitudes, resulting in requests for new techniques for weed control. In addition, we might see {{a greater number of}} weed species and higher biomass production due to increased concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere. Increased understanding of the biology of specific weed species will become more important in future weed control. This will help to control the weeds more efficiently. Higher prices on pesticides and a public demand for reduced use of pesticides make growers more inclined to use mechanical weed control on a larger scale and to a greater extent prevent weed establishment before sowing. A well-planned crop rotation is the most important preventive measure, which might also include delayed sowing, and dark harrowing and sowing. Research takes place on many levels within the weed area and several alternative methods are being developed. These include electric current, freezing, microwaves, biological control, etc. The present work is a literature review aiming at describing how a warmer and more humid climate with a higher CO 2 concentration will affect the need for weed control.

30|$|Why not an {{introduction}} of japonica rice from the northeast? Proponents of the Austric-farming-dispersal hypothesis (e.g. Bellwood 1996; Higham 2003) have often assumed that rice farming spread from Yunnan through Assam {{and into the}} Ganges. Others suggest that indica rice came from Southwest China (i.e. Yunnan), perhaps amongst early Austroasiatic speakers (Sagart 2008 : 138) or perhaps that Northeast India will eventually {{prove to be a}} rice domestication area and/or a staging post in the spread or rice from China to India (Van Driem 2011 a, b). However, any evidence for this, in terms of ceramic types, settlement patterns or archaeobotany is lacking. Admittedly Burma, Assam, Yunnana and Bengal are amongst the least well-known regions archaeobotanically and archaeologically—archaeology is very geographically biased (a point emphasized by Van Driem). Nevertheless based on current evidence, which is rapidly improving for Yunnan at least, the earliest rice farming in the upper Yangtze dates only from 2500 – 2000 BC at the earliest. It is of similar date in Orissa in eastern India and more or less of similar age in the Ganges. This gives insufficient time for such a spread, and if it had been quite so rapid one would expect more of an archaeological smoking gun, certainly on par with the Longshan-type harvest knives that were being made and used in Kashmir and Swat after 2000 BC. As for crops that did come from the far northeast of India and/or the Yangtze into the Ganges, such as Citrus trees, cultivated mango and the fibre crop ramie (Boehmeria nivea), these are all evident in middle Ganges sites from about 1400 BC onwards (see Saraswat 2004, 2005; Kingwell-Banham and Fuller 2011). This in my opinion indicates the first evidence for agricultural diffusion into the Indian plains via Assam. I make a distinction here of the plains, because Munda speakers in all likelihood did <b>migrate</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> the northeast, but with a preference of hill habitats (as per Fuller 2003; Harvey et al. 2006; and contra Fuller 2007; Donegan and Stampe 2004 hypothesis on Austroastiatic origins). This is likely to have involved vegeculture (especially taro), shifting cultivation, and rice, but perhaps more likely aus rice than japonica.|$|E

50|$|China {{has long}} been {{considered}} {{the exception to the}} general use of bloomeries.
