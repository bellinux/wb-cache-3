40|$|The {{performance}} of a DQDB MAN supporting both connection oriented (CO) and connectionless (CL) services as observed {{at the point of}} attachment to an ATM network {{is the subject of this}} paper. The overall quality of service (QoS) preserved in the ATM-DATM-DQDB interworking is reflected in the traffic statistics of the multiplexed stream exiting the ATM-DQDB interworking unit (IWU). For the purpose of accurately generating this stream a simulation model is developed. This incorporates several source node traffic models for CO and CL services, the DQDB and IWU protocols as well as the signalling and <b>metasignalling</b> procedures activated for the establishment of end-to-end connections among communicating users. Through numerical evaluation of several access priority rules and protocol architectures we identify all those factors that are essential for the design of both the CO DQDB functions and the ATM-DQDB interworking components...|$|E
40|$|This corpus-based study {{deals with}} the process whereby new {{compounds}} become established as conventionalized lexical items in the Swedish language. Special attention is given to how their meanings develop during the early phases of usage. Strictly compositional accounts of their semantics are rejected. Nine recently conventionalized compounds have been investigated in detail. The main corpus consists of all citations of these compounds from two full-text databases consisting of newspapers and magazines. Together they cover {{almost all of the}} major newspapers and several other ones as well. In addition to these corpus data, a questionnaire was used where informants were asked to describe (what they thought was) the meaning of these compounds and also to indicate how sure they were about the conventional usage of these words. Furthermore, the Swedish Language Bank has been used, mainly to get frequency data which show what kinds of word formation patterns the component parts of the compounds usually take part in, and how strong these patterns are. These data are used as reference points when analyzing the actual uses of the compounds and the semantic associations that the informants had. The compounds do not show a great deal of semantic variation. All but one has one clearly dominating sense, but most of the compounds are occasionally also used with strikingly deviant meanings. Metacomments and <b>metasignalling</b> seem {{to have an impact on}} conventionalization, at least they affect the familiarity of these items. While some of the compounds are extensively metacommented, explained and problematized, others are treated as natural and self-explanatory. The latter are generally found to instantiate strong word formation preferences, which make them seem transparent.  Hur nya ord får betydels...|$|E
40|$|A {{growing number}} of {{parallel}} system use Unix {{as the basis of}} their system software, rather than proprietary kernels. Moreover, conventional Unix services are used to spawn processes and control them. In many cases this leads to systems that are susceptible to pollution by stray processes that are not cleaned up properly when a job terminates. In the ParPar system, this is avoided by introducing the notion of <b>metasignals,</b> which are used to propagate signalling information among the nodes of the system. Thus when any process terminates abnormally, a <b>metasignal</b> is sent to the other nodes used by the job, where it is translated to a Unix SIGUSR 1 and forwarded to the remaining processes of the job. These processes can either catch the signal and re-organize the computation, or do nothing, in which case they are killed. This default mechanism provides the required cleanup, independent of possible support (or lack thereof) from the programming environment. 1 Introduction The high [...] ...|$|R
