40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is dedicated}} to three people—my wife, Mary Reilly, and my parents, Bernadette and Martin Reilly. Mary has sustained me through the trials and tribulations of the doctoral process. She has shouldered virtually all the household duties that I would normally be expected to do. Without her support I {{would not have been}} able to even consider entering, let alone, be completing the doctoral process. Much of <b>my</b> doctoral <b>degree</b> belongs to <b>my</b> wife—my best friend—Mary. I also must make note of the support of my parents—Martin and Bernadette. They have been supportive of all my endeavors from my enlisting in the Army during the Vietnam War, to <b>my</b> Bachelor’s <b>degree</b> at UMass in Amherst, to <b>my</b> Master’s <b>degree</b> at Springfield College, and now through this doctoral process.

40|$|<b>My</b> <b>degree's</b> work {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a system for electronical ordering food and drinks, in which I used Slovenian version of content management system (CMS) SloJoomla, which has arised from the system Joomla 1. 0. Before I started the development of the mentioned system it was necessary to decide what development tools and technologies I will use for development. Originally I imagined the system as a simple site without the CMS system, which would be made through the use of scripting languages and databases. After further consideration I decided to use the CMS system, whose primary purpose is easy producing and editting Web pages, because it offers us a wide range of functionality without necessary addition of an extension. By writing <b>my</b> <b>degree's</b> work I accepted a challenge and the primary purpose of CMS refunded {{with the development of}} a simple restaurant system, which would enable restaurants faster ordering, invoicing, updating the menu and order tracking. The system, which I developed, presents several advantages for users, both for the guest, as well as the bartender or the cashier. Guests have continued oversight to the menu and they don't have to wait for bartenders to make an order. They send their orders electronically. All their orders and total amount of all orders are visible on the screen. Cashier or waiter has access to all tables via the module, who manages orders of each user. He is also informed when the user demands the bill and he prints it out. He has the possibility of integration of several different user accounts. Developed modules and components can be of course improved and upgraded. ...|$|R

40|$|How should <b>my</b> <b>degrees</b> of {{credence}} in propositions about objective chances {{interact with}} <b>my</b> <b>degrees</b> of credence in other propositions? David Lewis (1980) formulated a precise answer. He {{called it the}} “Princi-pal Principle. ” And he took it to specify the role that {{a feature of the}} world must play if it is to count as chance. However, he also argued that the chances delivered by his best-system analysis of laws and chances could not possibly play the roles required of them by the Principal Principle: the Principal Principle is inconsistent with the best-system analysis. Later, Lewis (1994) came to accept a slightly different precise answer to the question. This is Michael Thau’s and Ned Hall’s amendment to the Prin-cipal Principle, which is known as the New Principle (Hall 1994; Thau 1994; Joyce 2007). The best-system analysis is consistent with the New Principle. Later still, Jenann Ismael (2008) proposed an alternative amendment to the Principal Principle, which she called the “Generalized Principal Principle. ” Ismael’s principle is also consistent with the best-system analysis. The large literature that has grown up around these proposals includes a number of different and illuminating arguments in their favor, as well as subtle improvements in their formulation. However, no attempt has been made to give them a formal justification. That is, there has been no attempt to deduce any chance-credence norm from more I would like to thank Rachael Briggs, Branden Fitelson, Ben Levinstein, Samir Okasha, Barry Loewer, Michael Strevens, Jim Pryor, Chris Hitchcock, and the referees and editors for this journal for very helpful comments on earlier versions of this article.
