5|$|The SL79 make up 40 of the 72 trams in the system, supplementing {{the newer}} SL95. Following the {{delivery}} of the SL95 low-floor trams in 1999 and 2000, Oslo Sporveier has a pure articulated fleet. The newer series has a greater turning radius, heavier axle load and is two-directional. The radius and axle load of the SL95 <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> it to operate around Majorstuen, requiring lines 11, 12 and 19 to use SL79-units. With the 1999-extension of the Ullevål Hageby Line to Rikshospitalet, the tramway received its first terminus without a balloon loop, making it necessary for lines 17 and 18 to be served only by SL95 units. These also serve line 13, since it {{is a continuation of}} the service along the Sinsen Line from Majorstuen. The SL79 operate on the Briskeby, Ekeberg, Frogner, Gamleby, Grünerløkka–Torshov, Kjelsås and Vika Lines. Each service has a ten-minute headway, giving a five-minute interval on section that are served by two lines.|$|E

25|$|The penny-farthing is a {{direct-drive}} bicycle, {{meaning the}} cranks and pedals are fixed {{directly to the}} hub. Instead of using gears to multiply the revolutions of the pedals, the driven wheel is enlarged {{to be close to}} the rider's inseam, to increase the maximum speed. This shifts the rider nearly on top of the wheel and <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> the rider to reach the ground while sitting on the seat.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability of}} a fishery to recover from {{overfishing}} depends on whether the ecosystem's conditions are suitable for the recovery. Dramatic changes in species composition can result in an ecosystem shift, where other equilibrium energy flows involve species compositions different from those that had been present before the depletion of the original fish stock. For example, once trout have been overfished, carp might take over {{in a way that}} <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> the trout to re-establish a breeding population.|$|E
25|$|The Australian painted lady's {{mating system}} evolved {{due to a}} highly {{dispersed}} female population. Food and oviposition sites are abundant as females feed {{on a wide range}} of host plants; therefore, females do not cluster around hotspots of resources. This tendency <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> a male to defend the entirety of a female's range. Therefore, the best strategy for males is to defend a territory in which females are likely to travel. Females generally only visit male territories when they are receptive, with the purpose of copulating. However, when an abundant food source attracts a significant number of females, males no longer exhibit territoriality, and are seen searching for mates in areas where females are clustered.|$|E

25|$|While the {{fundamental}} {{physics of the}} fission chain reaction in a nuclear weapon {{is similar to the}} physics of a controlled nuclear reactor, the two types of device must be engineered quite differently (see nuclear reactor physics). A nuclear bomb is designed to release all its energy at once, while a reactor is designed to generate a steady supply of useful power. While overheating of a reactor can lead to, and has led to, meltdown and steam explosions, the much lower uranium enrichment <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> a nuclear reactor to explode with the same destructive power as a nuclear weapon. It is also difficult to extract useful power from a nuclear bomb, although at least one rocket propulsion system, Project Orion, was intended to work by exploding fission bombs behind a massively padded and shielded spacecraft.|$|E
25|$|Critics have {{suggested}} that the system is fundamentally unfair as it restricts the choice for parents to choose schools and schools to choose their students although it does allow all students living in the community to have entry, as of right, regardless of their academic or social profile. In addition, there is evidence that property values surrounding some more desirable schools become inflated, thus restricting the ability of lower socio-economic groups to purchase a house in the zone, though this is off set by the fact that students are accepted from rental accommodation or from homes where they are boarding with a bona fide relative or friend living in the zone. Some parents have purposely flouted zone boundaries by giving false addresses, such as that of a business they own in the zone, or by renting homes in the zone only through the enrolment process and moving out before the student commences school. Schools are now requesting rates invoices, tenancy agreements, or power and telephone bills from parents to prove their residential address, Some schools have gone as far as requiring parents to make a statutory declaration before a Justice of the Peace or similar that they live in the school zone, which <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> a parent to cheat the zone without also committing a criminal offence (making a false statutory declaration is punishable by up to three years' imprisonment).|$|E
25|$|Flies in {{the genus}} Pseudacteon (phorid flies) {{are known to}} be {{parasitic}} to ants. These flies are parasitoids of the red imported fire ant in its native range in South America, and can be attracted through the ants' venom alkaloids. One species, Pseudacteon obtusus, attacks the ant by landing on the posterioral portion of the head and laying an egg. The location of the egg <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> the ant to successfully remove it. The larvae migrate to the head, then develop by feeding on the hemolymph, muscle tissue, and nervous tissue. After about two weeks, they cause the ant's head to fall off by releasing an enzyme that dissolves the membrane attaching the head to its body. The fly pupates in the detached head capsule, emerging two weeks later. P. tricuspis is another phorid fly that is a parasitoid to this species. Although parasitism pressures by these flies do not affect the ants' population density and activity, it has a small effect on a colony population. The strepsipteran insect Caenocholax fenyesi is known to infect male ants of this species and attack the eggs, and the mite Pyemotes tritici has been considered a potential biological agent against red imported fire ants, capable of parasitising every caste within the colony. Bacteria, such as Wolbachia, has been found in the red imported fire ant; three different variants of the bacteria are known to infect the red imported fire ant. However, its effect on the ant is unknown. Solenopsis daguerrei is a reproductive parasite to red imported fire ant colonies.|$|E

The Athsheans follow a polycyclic sleep pattern with a period of 120 minutes, which <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> them to adapt to the Terran eight-hour work day. Their dreaming is not restricted to times when they are asleep, with adept dreamers being able to dream while wide awake as well.

Smith was furious, seeing this as blackmail, and on 13 January 1965 wrote to Wilson: [...] "I am so incensed at the line of your High Commissioner's letter that I am replying directly to you...
