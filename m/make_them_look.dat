5|$|Extensive {{work was}} put into {{creating}} a genuine and historically correct atmosphere for the film. The facades of the houses of Mirabeau had to be replaced with painted polystyrene, to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>look</b> older, and all electric wires were put underground. Meanwhile, in Vaugines, Berri planted a dozen olive trees twelve months before filming started, and watered them throughout the waiting period, and for the second installment planted 10,000 carnations on the farm.|$|E
5|$|The three {{actors were}} given martial arts {{training}} ahead of filming. From August 1980, they were tutored by Kiyoshi Yamazaki, a karate black belt and master swordsman, who drilled them in sword-fighting styles that {{were meant to}} <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>look</b> proficient in using their weapons. They practiced each move in a fight at least 15times before filming. Yamazaki advised Leonard on the choreography of the sword fights and had a cameo role as one of Conan's instructors.|$|E
5|$|The trains {{were built}} in Goldau, Switzerland. CWA Constructions {{designed}} both the exterior and interior of the trains to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>look</b> as faithful {{as possible to the}} Hogwarts Express seen in the Harry Potter film franchise. They are based on the steam locomotive GWR 4900 Class 5972 Olton Hall (as 5972 Hogwarts Castle) and were built from aluminum and glass-reinforced plastics. Afterwards, an artificial weathering process was applied to give the appearance of a historic train.|$|E

5|$|Albert Brooks guest {{starred in}} the episode {{as the voice of}} Cowboy Bob. He was not sure if he wanted to be {{identified}} with a cartoon show or not at the time, like many of the other early guest stars on The Simpsons, and was therefore credited as A. Brooks in the ending credits. This episode was a satire of the Bigfoot specials that had aired on the Fox network at the time when this episode was written. A lot of resources were spent on the backgrounds in the episode, trying to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>look</b> realistic with many observational details such as trees, rocks, fences and the way the cars were positioned. Burger King figurines were made out of the camping designs of the Simpsons family in this episode.|$|E

25|$|In the Coloured Shoin teahouse Sen no Rikyū stained the timbers with {{a mixture}} of Bengal red dye and black dye to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>look</b> sooty and old. In contrast, his student's Oribe and Enshu {{preferred}} brighter colours and natural finishes. It is thought that this change coincided with the development of the regular wood plane that allowed a more consistent finish to wood and a better appreciation of the natural qualities of unfinished wood. It is a trait that has characterised the sukiya style since.|$|E
25|$|Pernkopf {{instructed}} them {{to paint}} the organs they saw in as much detail as possible, to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>look</b> like living tissue in print. This was enabled by a special treatment of the paper used for watercolor images that allowed greater detail than that type of paint normally did. The only deviation from this high level of realism {{was the use of}} color, where Pernkopf instructed them to use brighter hues than those found in real cadavers so that a reader would better learn to recognize and distinguish key anatomical landmarks.|$|E

25|$|Since Islam reached {{them much}} after Altishahr, {{personal}} names of non-Islamic Old Uyghur origin are still used in Qumul and Turfan while people in Altishahr use mostly Islamic names of Persian and Arabic origin. After {{the establishment of}} the Soviet Union, many Uyghurs who studied in Soviet Central Asia added Russian suffixes to Russify their surnames and <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>look</b> Russian. Names from Russia and Europe are used in Qaramay and Urumchi by part of the population of city-dwelling Uyghurs. Others use names with hard to understand etymologies, with the majority dating from the Islamic era and being of Persian or Arabic derivation.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{the staff}} found it {{challenging}} {{to run the}} game at 60 frames per second in high definition. The demand for 60 frames per second over more detailed graphics was made to ensure the game performed well online. Nevertheless, to save production time and budget, Oda allowed for three characters to obscure their faces so they would not require facial animations. Sound director Hideki Asanaka also found problems incorporating all the sound effects for the 3D game in contrast to previous titles. The team used camerawork in every Max Super Desperation Move and Climax Super Special Move in order to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>look</b> stylish. The battle design was made by Hayato Watanabe whereas Eisuke Ogura is the main artist.|$|E
25|$|Women are {{becoming}} more confident {{in the workplace and}} are trying harder to step up in their career. More and more of these women want to fit into the management level by trying to emulate men via fashion and outward appearance to appear more masculine and powerful. Most of the higher position in the work field were occupied by man at that time, it is understandable that how womenswear is influenced by man’s figure and body feature to mock the general existing powerful image at that time. Hence, they would want garments that empower them and <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>look</b> more masculine in shape, thus making the woman appear to be more capable of higher level tasks and seem more professional by fitting in with the male majority. This would be accomplished with attributes such as wider shoulders with the aid of padding and larger sleeves.|$|E

25|$|Halfway to Sanity is {{the tenth}} studio album by American punk band the Ramones. It was {{released}} on September 15, 1987 by Sire Records and was produced by Daniel Rey. Recording sessions began in April 1987 at Intergalactic Studios in New York City, and the band began recording instruments before vocals as a method to learn songs more quickly. Band members tended to disagree on many things at this time, and Rey described them to be impatient. The album's front cover was shot by previous Ramones' photographer George DuBose in Chinatown, New York City. The short lasted session resulted in a dimly lit album cover which guitarist Johnny Ramone said was good because it helped <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>look</b> younger. The band toured around the world following the album's release, but certain show dates were cancelled after drummer Richie Ramone left the band due to financial conflicts with the band. Clem Burke of Blondie was hired as Elvis Ramone to fill the drummer's spot for two shows, then was replaced the band's ex-member Marky Ramone, and the tour would continue with him.|$|E
25|$|The {{campaign}} was overshadowed by U.S. media criticism of Kỳ and Thiệu's unfair electoral practices and sneaky tricks. All the candidates {{were scheduled to}} attend a rally at Quảng Trị in the far north of the country on 6 August. Owing to the security situation {{and the possibility of}} communist attacks, the politicians were transported to joint campaign events by the military, rather than being free to go to separate events as their strategy dictated. However, the Quảng Trị event had to be canceled after the candidates’ plane landed 23km away at an air base in Đông Hà. Believing that the mishap was a deliberate attempt to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>look</b> chaotic and disorganized—Thiệu and Kỳ had decided not to attend rallies—the candidates boycotted the event and flew back to Saigon. There they denounced the government bitterly. The leading opposition candidate, Trần Văn Hương, claimed that Thiệu and Kỳ “purposefully arranged the trip to humiliate us and make clowns out of us.” As air force chief, Kỳ had previously stranded opposition politicians on a trip to the Central Highlands. Kỳ and Thiệu maintained that no malice was involved, but their opponents did not believe it. None of the candidates made good on their threat to withdraw, but their strident attacks over the alleged dirty tricks dominated the media coverage of the election for a period.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, George Street was added, {{and soon}} after Walford East tube station was built, to create further {{locations}} when EastEnders went from two to three episodes per week. The set was constructed by the BBC in-house construction department under construction manager Mike Hagan. The initial build took six months to complete. Most of the buildings on Albert Square have no interior filming space, with a few exceptions, and most do not have rears or gardens. Most areas by the front (and sometimes back) doors are decorated and dressed to match the interior set to allow shots of doors being opened. The grocery shop was originally open fronted, it {{was turned into a}} closed front shop, with removable interior walls to allow for filming inside the shop when the set was expanded in 1987. Some interior shots are filmed in the actual buildings, and the café also has some interior decoration so some limited filming can take place by the door. The newer exterior sets including fish and chip shop, video shop and beauty salon had some interior filming space to create a greater sense of realism. As the show is filmed up to six weeks in advance, the trees need to have extra leaves stuck on them during the spring to <b>make</b> <b>them</b> <b>look</b> like they would in summer.|$|E
5|$|The puffbirds {{are related}} to the jacamars and have the same range, but lack the {{iridescent}} colors of that family.
