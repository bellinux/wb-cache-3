40|$|AbstractTopical agents {{containing}} vitamin D 3 (VD 3) analogues such as calcipotriol, <b>maxacalcitol</b> and tacalcitol and {{the combination}} of calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate (betamethasone) are prescribed for patients with psoriasis. However, they are known to occasionally cause hypercalcemia, {{and the frequency of}} hypercalcemia is suggested to vary according to the VD 3 analogue used. In this study, to address the reason for these differences, the calcemic effects of maxacalcitol-, calcipotriol- and calcipotriol/betamethasone-containing ointments in rats were evaluated. The serum calcium levels in rats treated with ointments containing <b>maxacalcitol,</b> but not calcipotriol or calcipotriol/betamethasone, were significantly elevated, which is consistent with clinical observations. The serum concentration of VD 3 analogue in rats treated with ointments containing calcipotriol and calcipotriol/betamethasone was lower than that in rats treated with maxacalcitol-containing ointment. Thus, the calcemic effects appear {{to be associated with the}} systemic exposure of VD 3 analogues in rats. To understand the mechanism underlying the different systemic exposures of VD 3 analogues, skin permeation and metabolic stability of VD 3 analogues were evaluated. The cumulative amount of calcipotriol permeated through rat skin was significantly lower than that of <b>maxacalcitol.</b> On the other hand, the metabolic clearance of calcipotriol in rat hepatocytes was higher than that of <b>maxacalcitol.</b> Similar results were obtained using human skin and human hepatocytes. The current study demonstrates that the lower calcemic effects of calcipotriol- and calcipotriol/betamethasone-containing ointments are caused by the low systemic exposure of calcipotriol according to low skin permeability and rapid hepatic elimination after topical application...|$|E

However, the risk factors for hypercalcemia resulting from these ointments, and interactions with underlying disorders and age are unclear. We performed a retrospective study of psoriasis patients at Nagoya City University Hospital between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2009, treated with a vitamin D 3 -containing topical drug, either calcipotriol, <b>maxacalcitol,</b> or tacalcitol. Data from blood samples and clinical scores collected during routine visits throughout the study period were analyzed. We assessed changes in the serum calcium levels over time in association with age, liver dysfunction, renal dysfunction, concomitant medication, and concomitant therapy. Serum calcium levels were significantly lower in the calcipotriol group than in the <b>maxacalcitol</b> group (P &lt; 0. 05), regardless of other factors, at the observation period. Calcipotriol was associated with lower serum calcium levels than <b>maxacalcitol</b> in patients &ge; 65 years (P &lt; 0. 05), those with renal disease (P = 0. 0362), and those with liver disease (P = 0. 0255). Only three patients using calcipotriol developed hypercalcemia that {{did not seem to}} be related to the treatment. Hypercalcemia was observed in 10 patients using <b>maxacalcitol,</b> although serum calcium levels rapidly recovered when use was discontinued. Only one patient using tacalcitol developed hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia tended to occur in patients with conditions in which the skin is more vulnerable, even at standard doses; patients taking oral etretinate; patients requiring concomitant systemic therapy, even if the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score was not severe; and patients with renal or liver dysfunction. These findings highlight the importance of the awareness of the risk factors for hypercalcemia in patients treated with topical vitamin D 3 ointment, and point to calcipotriol as the first-choice treatment for those over 65 years old, or those with renal or liver disease.

40|$|Therapy {{combining}} radioguided parathyroidectomy (PTx) {{followed by}} intravenous <b>maxacalcitol</b> {{was given to}} a 50 -year-old Japanese man referred for treatment of uraemic secondary hyperparathyroid-ism. After laboratory and radiological examinations, the patient underwent uncomplicated, successful surgery, but glands {{that had not been}} detected radiologically before the procedure became apparent with a scintillation counter immediately after the removal of the swollen gland. To prevent relapse of secondary hyperparathyroidism in the remaining glands, 10 mg of <b>maxacalcitol</b> was injected intra-venously after each dialysis session. Following a minimally invasive radioisotope-guided PTx, the potential risk of relapse in the remaining glands has to be considered and intensive medical therapy should be instituted immediately after the operation. Further study needs to elucidate whether this treatment strategy can improve the long-term prognosis of patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism...|$|E
40|$|Percutaneous <b>maxacalcitol</b> {{injection}} therapy regresses hyperplasia of parathyroid and induces apoptosis in uremia. BackgroundA {{high level}} of parathyroid hormone (PTH) {{is considered to be}} an indicator of poor prognosis and a poor quality of life of dialysis patients; therefore, an effective and safe therapy for secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) has been developed. MethodsIn 20 patients with SHPT resistant to <b>maxacalcitol</b> (OCT) intravenously administered, all detectably enlarged parathyroid glands were treated by percutaneous <b>maxacalcitol</b> injection therapy (PMIT) under ultrasonographic guidance consecutively 6 times, which was followed by OCT that was intravenously administered. The clinical effects of PMIT were evaluated based on the changes in the serum intact-PTH, adjusted Ca, phosphorus, and bone marker levels, and the parathyroid gland volume determined by ultrasonography. Morphologic examination, apoptosis analysis, and PTH mRNA expression level determination by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using parathyroid tissues obtained by a biopsy technique were performed. ResultsPMIT and subsequent intravenous OCT administrations significantly decreased the serum intact-PTH level and parathyroid gland volume for at least 12 weeks after PMIT without major complications. Parathyroid tissues obtained after PMIT exhibited some partial defects of parathyroid cells, a marked {{increase in the number of}} the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) –positive cells, the ladder formation determined by DNA electrophoresis, and the decrease in the PTH mRNA expression level. ConclusionPMIT is effective and safe for the treatment of refractory SHPT, and a locally {{high level of}} OCT suppresses PTH secretion and regresses parathyroid hyperplasia, which is involved in the induction of apoptosis of parathyroid cells...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: It is {{well known}} that {{injection}} of calcitriol (CT) or <b>maxacalcitol</b> (OCT) is very effective in hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (2 HPT). However, it is difficult to use these drugs with peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients with 2 HPT because these drugs must be injected two or three times per week. The objective {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the stability of physiological activities of CT and OCT in PD bags and to determine the CT or OCT dosage for intraperitoneal (IP) administration. ♦ ♦ Materials and Methods: We added CT 1. 5 µg µµ or OCT 10 µg µµ to Dianeal PD- 2 (approximate pH = 5. 0, calcium...|$|E
30|$|Lesions notwithstanding, the patient’s CA 19 - 9 {{level was}} reduced by almost {{half in the}} first month after {{starting}} S- 1 chemotherapy (120  mg/day). Therefore, S- 1 chemotherapy was continued at a reduced dose of 100  mg/day after discussions with the patient and a dermatologist. The eruptions were treated with topical ointment and lotion (betamethasone butyrate propionate, <b>maxacalcitol,</b> tretinoin tocoferil, and dexamethasone valerate) (Fig.  2). The eruptions were aggravated by the administration of S- 1 and improved within 2  weeks after the discontinuation of S- 1. The pigmentation associated with the eruption gradually spread during periods of S- 1 administration. We continued S- 1 chemotherapy for 41  months after having adjusted the dose and dosage interval (Fig.  2). The subjective and objective symptoms improved when the rest interval was changed to 2  weeks followed by 3  weeks of treatment and the dose was reduced to 80  mg/day.|$|E
40|$|Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is {{characterized}} by extracellular plaques in the brain, mainly consisting of amyloid-β (Aβ), as derived from sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein. Epidemiological studies suggest a tight link between hypovitaminosis of the secosteroid vitamin D and AD. Besides decreased vitamin D level in AD patients, an effect of vitamin D on Aβ-homeostasis is discussed. However, the exact underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated and nothing {{is known about the}} potential effect of vitamin D analogues. Here we systematically investigate the effect of vitamin D and therapeutically used analogues (<b>maxacalcitol,</b> calcipotriol, alfacalcidol, paricalcitol, doxercalciferol) on AD-relevant mechanisms. D 2 and D 3 analogues decreased Aβ-production and increased Aβ-degradation in neuroblastoma cells or vitamin D deficient mouse brains. Effects were mediated by affecting the Aβ-producing enzymes BACE 1 and γ-secretase. A reduced secretase activity was accompanied by a decreased BACE 1 protein level and nicastrin expression, an essential component of the γ-secretase. Vitamin D and analogues decreased β-secretase activity, not only in mouse brains with mild vitamin D hypovitaminosis, but also in non-deficient mouse brains. Our results further strengthen the link between AD and vitamin D, suggesting that supplementation of vitamin D or vitamin D analogues might have beneficial effects in AD prevention...|$|E
40|$|Cardiorenal {{syndrome}} (CRS) {{refers to}} a constellation of conditions whereby heart and kidney diseases are pathophysiologically connected. For clinical purposes, {{it would be more}} appropriate to emphasize the pathophysiological pathways to classify CRS into: (1) hemodynamic, (2) atherosclerotic, (3) uremic, (4) neurohumoral, (5) anemic–hematologic, (6) inflammatory–oxidative, (7) vitamin D receptor (VDR) and/or FGF 23 -, and (8) multifactorial CRS. In recent years, there have been a preponderance data indicating that vitamin D and VDR {{play an important role in}} the combination of renal and cardiac diseases. This review focuses on some important findings about VDR activation and its role in CRS, which exists frequently in chronic kidney disease patients and is a main cause of morbidity and mortality. Pathophysiological pathways related to suboptimal or defective VDR activation may play a role in causing or aggravating CRS. VDR activation using newer agents including vitamin D mimetics (such as paricalcitol and <b>maxacalcitol)</b> are promising agents, which may be related to their selectivity in activating VDR by means of attracting different post-D-complex cofactors. Some, but not all, studies have confirmed the survival advantages of D-mimetics as compared to non-selective VDR activators. Higher doses of D-mimetic per unit of parathyroid hormone (paricalcitol to parathyroid hormone ratio) is associated with greater survival, and the survival advantages of African American dialysis patients could be explained by higher doses of paricalcitol (> 10  μg/week). More studies are needed to verify these data and to explore additional avenues for CRS management via modulating VDR pathway...|$|E
40|$|Direct <b>maxacalcitol</b> (OCT) {{injection}} into a {{parathyroid gland}} (PTG) ameliorates several important etiologic factors {{of resistance to}} medical treatments for secondary hyperparathyroidism (s-HPT) : the upregulations of vitamin D receptor (VDR) and Ca-sensing receptor (CaSR) in PTGs and the regression of PTG hyperplasia by the induction of apoptosis. In this study, we evaluated the bone histomorphology {{on the basis of}} maintaining these effects in advanced s-HPT. Five/six nephrectomized Sprague–Dawley rats were fed a high-phosphorus and low-calcium diet for 8 weeks. These rats were divided into four treatment groups: (1) basic uremic (at the baseline), (2) direct OCT single injection into PTGs (DI-OCT) followed by OCT intravenous administration for 4 weeks (IV-OCT), (3) direct vehicle injection and IV-OCT, and (4) no treatment for an additional 4 weeks. The effects of these treatments on serum intact-parathyroid hormone (PTH) level, PTG weight, VDR and CaSR expression levels in PTGs, and bone histomorphometric parameters were investigated. In the DI-OCT+IV-OCT group, the significant decrease in serum intact-PTH level was maintained by the following IV-OCT. A significant decrease in PTG weight and the upregulations of VDR and CaSR expression levels in PTGs were also observed. Bone histomorphometric analysis showed significant improvements in osteitis fibrosa in both cancellous and cortical bones. However, these findings were not observed in the other groups. These results suggest that osteitis fibrosa caused by advanced s-HPT can be successfully reversed by a control of PTH at an appropriate level through the improvement of PTG hyperplasia as induced by DI-OCT+IV-OCT...|$|E
40|$|Renal {{osteodystrophy}} {{is characterized}} by abnormalities in bone turnover, mineralization, and bone volume. The effects of treatment modalities for renal osteodystrophy on bone should be analyzed with respect to these abnormalities. The major treatment modalities for renal osteodystrophy include phosphate binders, vitamin D compounds, and calcimimetics. Aluminum-containing phosphate binders {{have been shown to}} be toxic to bone secondary to their effects on bone turnover, mineralization, and bone volume. The use of calcium-based phosphate binders has been associated with the development of adynamic bone disease (low bone turnover), bone loss, and worsening of vascular calcifications. New nonaluminum, noncalcium phosphate binders have been developed (sevelamer hydrochloride and lanthanum carbonate). These agents show a potential for improvement in bone turnover and bone volume. Patients with renal osteodystrophy are deficient in calcitriol and often in calcidiol. Calcidiol deficiency has been underappreciated and deserves to be addressed in the treatment of patients with renal osteodystrophy. Calcitriol replacement therapy by daily oral administration is associated with frequent episodes of hypercalcemia and suppression of bone turnover in patients with stages 3 to 5 chronic kidney disease. Pulse oral or intravenous calcitriol administration induces frequent episodes of hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia, respectively, and achieves the same degree of correction of bone abnormalities. There are no data on the effects of paricalcitol or doxercalciferol on human bone. Experimental data, however, show that these two analogues and <b>maxacalcitol</b> may control serum parathyroid hormone levels without suppressing bone turnover. Calcimimetics lower parathyroid hormone levels and bone turnover...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{increasing}} survival rate of cardiac and renal disease patients, Cardiorenal syndrome (CRS), {{a combination of}} these two is becoming an important problem. Some classifications have been proposed for CRS but for clinical approach, it would be more appropriate to emphasize the pathophysiologic pathways to classify CRS into: 1 hemodynamic, 2 atherosclerotic, 3 uremic, 4 neurohumoral, 5 anemic-hematologic, 6 inflammatory-oxidative, 7 vitamin D receptor (VDR) related, and 8 multi-factorial CRS. Recently, it has been revealed that vitamin D and its receptor {{play an important role in}} the CRS. Decreased 1 -α-hydroxylase activity, nutritional deficiency, decreased Megalin receptors, and increased 1 - 24 -hydroxylase activity are major causes for vitamin D depletion in CKD. Decrease in GFR, renal mass and 1 -α-hydroxylase expression along with phosphate retention, increased FGF- 23, and loss of both 1 -α-hydroxylase and 25 (OH) vitamin D are important factors for decreased 1 -α-hydroxylase activity. Suboptimal or defective VDR activation may play a role in causing or aggravating CRS. Newer VDR activators such as vitamin D mimetics (e. g. paricalcitol and <b>maxacalcitol)</b> are promising agents. Some studies have confirmed the survival advantages of D-mimetics as compared to non-selective VDR activators. Higher doses of D-mimetic per unit of PTH (paricalcitol to PTH ratio) are associated with greater survival, and the survival advantages of African American dialysis patients could be explained by higher received doses of paricalcitol. More studies are needed to verify these data and to explore additional avenues for CRS management via modulating VDR pathway...|$|E
40|$|Vitamin D {{receptor}} activators (VDRAs) {{can protect}} against mineral bone disease, {{but they are}} reported to elevate serum creatinine (SCr) and may also reduce glomerular filtration rate (GFR). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effect of VDRAs on kidney function and adverse events. MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched for RCTs that evaluate vitamin D receptor activators (alfacalcidol, calcitriol, doxercalciferol, falecalcitriol, <b>maxacalcitol</b> and paricalcitol) up to March 2015. We included 31 studies, {{all of which were}} performed between 1976 and 2015, which enrolled 2621 patients. Patients receiving VDRAs had lower eGFR (weighted mean difference WMD - 1. 29 mL/min / 1. 73 m 2, 95 % CI - 2. 42 to - 0. 17) and elevated serum creatinine (WMD 7. 03 μmol/L, 95 % CI 0. 61 to 13. 46) in sensitivity analysis excluding studies with dropout rate more than 30 %. Subgroup analysis of the 5 studies that not use SCr-based measures did not indicated lower GFR in the VDRAs group(WMD - 0. 97 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2, 95 % CI - 4. 85 to 2. 92). Compared with control groups, {{there was no difference in}} all-cause mortality (relative risk RR 1. 41, 95 % CI 0. 58 to 3. 80), cardiovascular disease (RR 0. 84, 95 % CI 0. 42 to 1. 71), and severe adverse events (RR 1. 15, 95 % CI 0. 75 to 1. 77) for the VDRAs groups. Episodes of hypercalcemia (RR 3. 29, 95 % CI 2. 02 to 5. 38) were more common in the VDRAs group than in the control group. Administration of VDRAs increased serum creatinine levels. Subgroup analysis of studies that did not use SCr-based measures did not indicate a lower GFR in the VDRA group. Future studies with non-SCr-based measures are needed to assess whether the mild elevations of serum creatinine are of clinical significance...|$|E
