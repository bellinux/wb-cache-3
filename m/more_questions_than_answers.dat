5|$|Citizen Kane eschews the {{traditional}} linear, chronological narrative, and tells Kane's story entirely in flashback using {{different points of}} view, many of them from Kane's aged and forgetful associates, the cinematic equivalent of the unreliable narrator in literature. Welles also dispenses {{with the idea of}} a single storyteller and uses multiple narrators to recount Kane's life. The use of multiple narrators was unheard of in Hollywood films. Each narrator recounts a different part of Kane's life, with each story partly overlapping. The film depicts Kane as an enigma, a complicated man who, in the end, leaves viewers with <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> <b>answers</b> as to his character, such as the newsreel footage where he is attacked for being both a communist and a fascist.|$|E
25|$|England's second innings batting {{effort was}} an {{improvement}} on the first, but still left people with <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> <b>answers.</b> Andrew Strauss was out for 0, Michael Vaughan looked brilliant for 21 runs but then edged Makhaya Ntini through to Mark Boucher. Alastair Cook scored a decent score of 60, {{but not enough}} to get England out of trouble. Kevin Pietersen came in for the most criticism, scoring 13 runs of 4 balls before edging through to the keeper off the bowling of Jacques Kallis.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Medwin's legacy {{tends to}} raise <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> <b>answers.</b> Was he a chancer who lived beyond his means and ruined {{his father and}} wife? He tended to fall out with former {{associates}} including Shelley's widow and Trelawney. His writings on Byron and Shelley are often imprecise. Shelley's fame grew throughout the 19th century and his legacy became an obsession for Medwin as for others in the Pisan circle. Medwin was opportunistic and disregarded the feelings of many former friends, but he remains {{the main source of}} information on Shelley's childhood. His Conversations of Lord Byron is now seen generally as vivid and essentially a true picture of the man.|$|E

40|$|This six-hand {{written paper}} insists on the non-dichotomy between body and mind, action and thought, {{objectivity}} and subjectivity, {{in order to}} reach the fertile adult-child relationships within fictionality. It supports the practice of theater teaching both at the university and at school, in the key of an embodied dramaturgy: a writing mode and usage of the dramaturgical text in which corporeality is central. Presenting <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> <b>answering</b> them, it searches for a dramaturgical work that narrates, dialogues, and proposes performativity and changes in the worlds-of-life of teachers in Undergraduate Theater Teachers Education {{as well as in the}} worlds-of-life of their prospective students, Brazilian children and teenagers...|$|R
25|$|A {{mental health}} care {{navigator}} is an individual who assists patients and families to find appropriate {{mental health care}}givers, facilities and services. Individuals who are care navigators are often also trained therapists and doctors. The need for mental health care navigators arises from the fragmentation of the mental health industry, which can often leave those in need with <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> <b>answers.</b> Care navigators work closely with patients through discussion and collaboration to provide information on options and referrals to healthcare professionals, facilities, and organizations specializing in the patients’ needs. The difference between other mental health professionals and a care navigator is that a care navigator provides information and directs a patient to the best help rather than offering diagnosis, prescription of medications or treatment.|$|E
500|$|... "Flesh and Stone" [...] has {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Daniel Martin gave the episode a positive review on The Guardian guardian.co.uk, {{saying that it}} [...] "can lay credible claim to being the greatest episode of Doctor Who there has ever been". He went on to declare: [...] "It's just ridiculously good— so much that there's scarcely any point in picking out moments because there was an iconic sequence every couple of seconds." [...] In particular he praised Father Octavian's death scene, noting how [...] "despair creeps over Matt Smith's face as he realises {{he is going to}} have to leave him to die; Octavian's final speech weeps with honour and elegance". IGN's Matt Wales gave the episode a 10 out of 10 rating, saying it was [...] "packed with huge, iconic moments" [...] and stated, [...] "by the end of it, we were left with <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> <b>answers</b> and a far better sense of Moffat's meticulous planning".|$|E

50|$|LoveHKFilm {{rated the}} film as pushing beyond its {{original}} intentions, leaving <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> <b>answering</b> them {{at the end of}} the run. While a relatively enjoyable film, it was obviously commercialized, citing scenes where all lead actors are crammed into one room or bringing back characters who were killed in the previous film in order to garner screentime for them. Although Tony Leung won the Best Actor award at the Hong Kong Film Awards and the Golden Horse Awards for his portrayal of Chan Wing-yan in the original Infernal Affairs, Andy Lau was the one who won the Best Actor award at the 41st Golden Horse Awards for his portrayal of Lau Kin-ming in Infernal Affairs III.|$|R

2500|$|The Bermudian cricket team toured Kenya {{during the}} 2006–07 season. The tour began on 5 November 2006 and lasted until 14 November 2006. The tour {{began with a}} drawn Intercontinental Cup match, {{followed}} by [...] a 3 ODI series which was won comprehensively by Kenya 3-0. It was a must win for both teams, as the World Cup was only four months away, and this series would give the selectors an opportunity {{to figure out the}} squad to send to the World Cup. Kenya left with a good indication as to what their team was, but Bermuda left with many <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> <b>answers.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The critic Michael Watchel has {{suggested}} that Pushkin intended to produce a national epic in this poem, arguing that the Peter sections have many of the typical features of epic poetry. He points to Pushkin's extensive use of Old Testament language and allusions when describing both the founding of St Petersburg and the flood and argues that they draw heavily on the Book of Genesis. Further evidence for the categorization of Pushkin’s poem as an epic {{can be seen in}} its rhyme scheme and stanza structure which [...] allow the work to convey its meaning in a very concise yet artistic manner. Another parallel to the classical epic tradition can be drawn in the final scenes of Evgenii’s burial described as “for God’s sake.” In Russian, this phrase is not one of “chafing impatience, but of the kind of appeal to Christian sentiment which a beggar might make” according to Newman. Therefore, it is a lack of empathy and charity in Petersburg that ultimately causes Evgenii’s death. The requirement that civilization must have a moral order is a theme also found in the writings of Virgil. However, he adds that the Evgenii plot runs counter to the epic mode, and praises Pushkin for his [...] "remarkable ability to synthesize diverse materials, styles and genres". What is particularly unusual is that Pushkin focuses on a protagonist that is humble as well as one that is ostensibly great. There are <b>more</b> <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> <b>answers</b> in this new type of epic, where “an agnostic irony can easily find a place” while “the unbiased reader would be forced to recognize as concerned with the profoundest issues which confront humanity”. He concludes that if the poem is to be labeled a national epic, it is a [...] "highly idiosyncratic" [...] one.|$|E
