5|$|Developed {{alongside}} the subsonic and smaller Hawker Siddeley P.1127/Kestrel, the P.1154 {{was derived from}} the P.1150. The P.1150 proposal did not meet NATO Basic <b>Military</b> <b>Requirement</b> 3 and, consequently, the P.1154 was born. This Mach 2-capable aircraft retained plenum chamber burning previously designed for the P.1150. Although the technical winner of eleven submissions, follow-on testing and production for the P.1154 did not proceed as a result of political strife.|$|E
5|$|During {{the flight}} test program, the issuing of NATO Basic <b>Military</b> <b>Requirement</b> 3 (NBMR-3) did not {{prove to be}} the {{opportunity}} as envisioned by Hawker, as NBMR-3 sought performance characteristics of which the P.1127 was not only unable to meet, but unlikely to be developed to meet in its current form either. As such, in 1961, there was little military interest in the P.1127 program, although, in January 1961, Hawker was requested to provide a quote for the costs involved in a potential 100 production standard P.1127 aircraft. Meanwhile, Hawker believed that the continuing development of the P.1127 would serve a successful demonstration, acting to dissuade potential customers from pursuing competing 'paper' VTOL aircraft projects.|$|E

5|$|In 1961, NATO issued NATO Basic <b>Military</b> <b>Requirement</b> 3 (NBMR-3) which {{specified}} a VTOL aircraft, {{albeit one}} with the supersonic performance of an aircraft such as the F-4 Phantom II, along with the VTOL capability. Recognising that the P.1127 would not satisfy this, Hawker commenced work upon a new project, designated P.1150, which was effectively a supersonic derivative of the P.1127, as well as another version, designated P.1154, which would meet the specified requirements of NBMR-3. The P.1154 was declared {{the winner of the}} NATO competition; prototype construction was already underway at the point of cancellation in 1965. The French government had withdrawn shortly after the P.1154's selection over the Dassault Mirage IIIV.|$|E
25|$|Only {{months after}} the system became fully operational, the Cold War came to an end. The <b>military</b> <b>requirement</b> for the OTH-B radar network was {{therefore}} greatly diminished. The mission of the ECRS radar system was redirected to counter-narcotics surveillance and drug interdiction, and the ECRS operated in this capacity for several years. The three OTH radars of the WCRS were mothballed, and the incomplete North Sector in Alaska was cancelled.|$|E

25|$|Because Navajo has {{a complex}} grammar, {{it is not}} nearly {{mutually}} intelligible enough with even its closest relatives within the Na-Dene family to provide meaningful information. It was still an unwritten language, and Johnston thought Navajo could satisfy the <b>military</b> <b>requirement</b> for an undecipherable code. Navajo was spoken only on the Navajo lands of the American Southwest. Its syntax and tonal qualities, not to mention dialects, made it unintelligible to anyone without extensive exposure and training. One estimate indicates that at the outbreak of World War II, fewer than 30 non-Navajo could understand the language.|$|E
25|$|Firstly, the {{underlying}} idea of Bruns has not proved viable (there were needs for refraction observations near the astronomical horizon, which—as Julius Bauschinger could {{show a little}} later—in principle can not be obtained with the required accuracy). On the other hand, the progress in the direct measurement of atmospheric data (weather balloon ascents) has since made the painstaking accuracy of this data from refraction observations unnecessary.

500|$|In August1961, NATO {{released}} an updated revision of its VTOL strike fighter requirement, NATO Basic <b>Military</b> <b>Requirement</b> 3 (NBMR-3).

Victory in this competition was viewed being of a high importance at the time as it was seem as being potentially [...] "the first real NATO combat aircraft". However, due to changes made to the requirement, the P.1150 was considered to be undersized and thus unsatisfactory, which led to a desire for a redesign. Wood views the decision not to persist with the original P.1150 design was a [...] "serious setback...it would have provided a first class basic type".|$|E
