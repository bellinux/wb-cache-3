50|$|More {{than one}} move can be {{regarded}} as the best depending on which strategy is used.

The computational complexity also shows here as a move might not be immediately important, but after many moves could become highly important as other areas of the board take shape.|$|E

50|$|Comfy Cakes is a hand-eye {{coordination}} game. The {{object is to}} fill orders in a bakery by assembling a layer cake to match a given specification, by controlling a conveyor belt that brings the cake to various stations. Elements of the cake include shapes (square, circular or heart-shaped), flavor of batter (strawberry, chocolate or vanilla), filling (either pink, yellow, or brown), optional icing (flavors as used in the batter) and other decorations (e.g. sugar may be sprinkled {{on top of the}} cake, and in rarer cases, flames are applied to iced cakes to create a smooth glaze). If the cake does not match the specification, the player is penalized and the cake gets thrown in the trash. If the player sends three incorrect orders, the game is over. After a certain number of correct orders are shipped, the player wins the game, and the score is tabulated. The final score depends upon the number of cakes baked, the number of incorrect orders sent and the efficiency of the player in baking. At higher levels the specifications become more complex and multiple cakes must be manufactured in parallel on a single conveyor belt. The player makes about 5 or 6 cakes in one of the difficulty levels.Purble Shop is a code-breaker game. The computer decides the color of up to five features (hat, eyes, nose, mouth and clothes) that are concealed from the player. Any color may be used for any feature, and a color can be used once, several times or not used at all. The player then attempts to deduce or guess the correct feature colors in a limited number of moves. There are three difficulty levels: Beginner with three features in three possible colors for 33 = 27 different possible solutions, Intermediate with 44 = 256 solutions, and Advanced with 55 = 3125 solutions. The beginner and intermediate levels are guessing games where after each <b>move</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> tells the player which items were correct, so there is little scope for deduction. At the advanced level the computer doesn't tell the player which specific items were correct, reporting only the count of picks in the correct color and position, and the count of picks in the correct color but the wrong position. This level is similar to the colored peg game Mastermind where success requires logical reasoning (although, there is a small chance of succeeding through lucky guesses).|$|E

40|$|Background: Sensorimotor deficits are an {{important}} phenomenological facet observed in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). However, there is little research on this topic. We hypothesize that the MPraxis test {{can be used to}} screen for motor impairments in BD aiming movements. Method: The MPraxis, which is a quick and easy-to-apply computerized test, measures sensorimotor control. During the test, the participant must <b>move</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> mouse cursor over an ever-shrinking green box and click on it once. We predict that the MPraxis test is capable of detecting differences in sensorimotor performance between patients with BD and controls. We assessed 21 euthymic type I BD patients, without DSM-IV-TR Axis I comorbidity, and 21 healthy controls. Results and conclusions: Compared to the controls, the patients with BD presented a lower response time in their movements in all conditions. Our results showed sensorimotor deficits in BD and suggested that the MPraxis test can be used to screen for motor impairments in patients with euthymic BD...|$|E
40|$|U. S. Air Force special tactics {{operators}} {{at times}} use small wearable computers (SWCs) for mission objectives.

40|$|Taijiquan (TJQ) is a Chinese martial art, in the West known {{primarily}} as a stand-alone version of moving meditation, which was developed mainly {{on the experience of}} martial art. The main goal of TJQ as a martial art is to control the opponent’s balance with as little force as possible and can be described with the well-known metaphor that “ 4 ounce can defeat 1000 ounce. ” This metaphor usually stands for a special effect in TJQ, called fajing. To understand the basic movement principles of TJQ we have to analyse the experience itself. On the basis of first- person analysis, we designed a number of pilot and one extensive study. In this article we will present an intervention method that uses TJQ movement principles to modulate motoric (MM) process and produces the fajing effect – which usually takes years of proper exercise – in just 15 to 20 minutes. A pilot study was designed to measure the influence of MM method on our movement. The participants had to use each arm to work on a different task.
