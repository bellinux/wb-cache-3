25|$|The {{self-organizing}} {{behavior of}} drivers in traffic flow determines {{almost all the}} spatiotemporal behavior of traffic, such as traffic breakdown at a highway bottleneck, highway capacity, {{and the emergence of}} <b>moving</b> <b>traffic</b> jams. In 1996–2002 these complex self-organizing effects were explained by Boris Kerner's three-phase traffic theory.|$|E
25|$|This {{function}} {{is meant to}} indicate a hazard such as a vehicle stopped in or near <b>moving</b> <b>traffic,</b> a disabled vehicle, a vehicle moving substantially slower than the flow of traffic such as a truck climbing a steep grade, or the presence of stopped or slow traffic ahead on a high speed road.|$|E

However, they may enforce all state and local laws while in their county, including traffic offenses. Constables may serve arrest warrants anywhere in Texas.|$|E
25|$|Streets in {{downtown}} follow a grid pattern. In residential areas of downtown, some neighbourhoods are traffic-calmed and include traffic circles at intersections {{to slow the}} speed of cars and discourage thoroughfare traffic. Northumberland Street and Odell Avenue have adopted speedbumps to slow fast <b>moving</b> <b>traffic.</b> The pattern of streets {{in the rest of}} the city varies including straight thoroughfares (such as Smythe Street, Prospect Street and Regent Street), to curved streets and cul-de-sacs in primarily residential areas.|$|E
25|$|In a radial structure, {{main roads}} {{converge}} on a central point. This form could evolve from successive growth {{over a long}} time, with concentric traces of town walls and citadels marking older city boundaries. In more recent history, such forms were supplemented by ring roads <b>moving</b> <b>traffic</b> around the outskirts of a town. Dutch cities such as Amsterdam and Haarlem are structured as a central square surrounded by concentric canals marking every expansion. In cities such as and also Moscow, this pattern is still clearly visible.|$|E
50|$|Lane {{splitting}} {{is riding}} a bicycle or motorcycle between lanes or rows of slow <b>moving</b> or stopped <b>traffic</b> <b>moving</b> {{in the same}} direction. It is sometimes called lane sharing, whitelining, filtering, or stripe-riding. This allows riders to save time, bypassing traffic congestion, and may also be safer than stopping behind stationary vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Filtering or {{filtering}} forward describes <b>moving</b> through <b>traffic</b> that is stopped. Lane splitting means riding {{between two}} lanes of vehicles, while filtering can also refer to using {{space on the}} outside edge of same-direction traffic.|$|R
50|$|In 2015-16, Government of India, {{declared}} 106 National Waterways (NW) under Inland Waterways Authority of India {{to reduce}} the cost of transportation and lower the carbon footprint by <b>moving</b> the <b>traffic</b> from surface roads and railroads to waterways.|$|R
25|$|Traffic {{exiting the}} {{roundabout}} comes from one direction, rather than three, simplifying the pedestrian's visual environment. Traffic moves slowly {{enough to allow}} visual engagement with pedestrians, encouraging deference towards them. Other benefits include reduced driver confusion associated with perpendicular junctions and reduced queuing associated with traffic lights. They allow U-turns within the normal flow of traffic, which often are not possible at other forms of junction. Moreover, since vehicles on average spend less time idling at roundabouts than at signalled intersections, using a roundabout potentially leads to less pollution. Also, when entering vehicles only need to give way, they do not always perform a full stop. As a result, by keeping {{a part of their}} momentum, the engine will produce less work to regain the initial speed, resulting in lower emissions. Additionally, slow <b>moving</b> <b>traffic</b> in roundabouts makes less noise than traffic that must stop and start, speed up and brake.|$|E

Eleven national highways {{passing through the}} state which are together 3078.40km in length. However, most national highways are in poor condition and provide only two lanes for slow <b>moving</b> <b>traffic.</b> Many national highways are on paper and not fully converted into four-lane highway.

2500|$|Safety Last! is a 1923 American silent {{romantic comedy}} film {{starring}} Harold Lloyd. It includes {{one of the}} most famous images from the silent film era: Lloyd clutching the hands of a large clock as he dangles from the outside of a skyscraper above <b>moving</b> <b>traffic.</b> The film was highly successful and critically hailed, and it cemented Lloyd's status as a major figure in early motion pictures. [...] It is still popular at revivals, and it is viewed today as one of the great film comedies.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the inner}} London suburbs {{and away from}} town centres, there was no {{disturbance}} by <b>moving</b> <b>traffic</b> to thin out the dense fog in the back streets. The result was that visibility could be down to a metre or so in the daytime. Walking out of doors became a matter of shuffling one's feet to feel for potential obstacles such as road kerbs. This was made even worse at night since each back street lamp {{at the time was}} fitted with an incandescent light-bulb, which gave no penetrating light onto the pavement for pedestrians to see their feet, or even the lamp post. Fog-penetrating fluorescent lamps did not become widely available until later on in the 1950s. [...] "Smog masks" [...] were worn by those who were able to purchase them from chemists.|$|E

She had {{to attend to}} all the <b>moving</b> <b>traffic,</b> such as bullock-carts that blocked the way, and camels, and led ponies; {{as well as to}} keep up her dignity when she passed low friends running in the dust. She never yapped for yapping's sake, but her shrill, high bark was known all along the Mall, and other men's terriers ki-yied in reply, and bullock-drivers looked over their {{shoulders}} and gave us the road with a grin.|$|E

Louisa, {{straining}} her eyes, watched the excited crowd pouring {{out of the station}} in the wake of porters and of piles of luggage, jabbering, shouting, and fussing like an army of irresponsible pigmies: men in blouses, and men in immaculate bowler hats, women wrapped in furs, clinging to gigantic headgear that threatened to leave the safe refuge of an elaborate coiffure or of well fixed gargantuan hatpins, midinettes in fashionable skirts and high-heeled shoes, country women in wool shawls that flapped round their bulky forms like the wings of an overfed bat, all hurrying and jostling one another in a mad endeavour to avoid the onrush of the innumerable taxi-autos which in uncountable numbers wound {{in and out of the}} slower <b>moving</b> <b>traffic</b> like the erratic thread of some living, tangled skein.|$|E
50|$|When {{the vehicle}} is stopped the ICE is {{switched}} off without idling, while the battery provides whatever power is needed at rest. Vehicles at traffic lights, or in slow <b>moving</b> stop-start <b>traffic</b> need not burn fuel when stationary or moving slowly, reducing emissions.|$|R
