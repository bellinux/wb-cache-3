5|$|There {{are good}} {{examples}} of horizontal water mills, also known as Norse or Clack Mills, around Dutch Loch. Originally these were two story buildings with turf roofs, built into banks to give access to the upper floor where the mill-stone was sited. Inside the building there was a fixed lower <b>millstone,</b> and a rotating upper <b>millstone</b> driven by the water falling onto the paddles below. Some were still in use on Papa Stour {{in the early years}} of the 20th century, and there is still a working example of one of these mills on the Burn of Clumlie, at Troswick in the south Mainland of Shetland.|$|E
5|$|NY167 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US20 (West Main Street) near {{the northern tip of}} Canadarago Lake {{in the village}} of Richfield Springs. The route proceeds north as a two-lane highway along Church Street, passing through the village's residential northern portion before leaving Richfield Springs and crossing the Otsego–Herkimer county line just a half-mile (0.8km) from the junction with US20. The residential surroundings follow NY167 into the town of Warren; however, they give way to more open, undeveloped areas as the route intersects <b>Millstone</b> Road (County Route78 or CR78, an unsigned number) about a half-mile (0.8km) from the county line. From <b>Millstone</b> Road, the route winds northeast through Warren, traveling through increasingly rural areas as it serves the hamlet of Cullen and intersects Cullen and Hogsback roads (CR183) {{in the center of the}} small community.|$|E
5|$|The {{central and}} {{southern}} section of the Peak District, where Carboniferous Limestone is found {{at or near the}} surface, is known as the White Peak in contrast to the northern Dark Peak and the South West Peak, which are characterised by <b>Millstone</b> Grit outcrops and broad swathes of moorland.|$|E
5000|$|The {{coat-of-arms}} is {{from modern}} times. The arms were granted on 10 March 1989. It shows three white <b>millstones</b> {{on a blue}} background. The <b>millstones</b> were chosen because the production of <b>millstones</b> is the oldest industry in the municipality and has been {{very important to the}} life of the community.|$|R
50|$|The mill {{has three}} pairs of <b>millstones.</b> The <b>millstones</b> are 4 1/2 feet across and weigh about 2,400 lbs, and rotate at about 125 rpm. About 60% of the power is used to turn the <b>millstones,</b> the rest for the {{remaining}} machinery. The Peirce family themselves were not millers and did not operate the mill, but instead had other millers do so.|$|R
50|$|The <b>millstones</b> {{are three}} pairs of French Burr stones and one pair of Peak stones. Two pairs of the French Burr stones are 4 ft {{diameter}} {{and the other two}} pairs of <b>millstones</b> are 4 ft diameter.|$|R
5|$|Generally {{the bedrock}} of {{the west of the}} town {{consists}} of coal measures, which were exploited by the coal mining industry, while the east is mainly <b>millstone</b> grit. Overlying the bedrock are deposits of glacial sand and gravel, clay, and some alluvial deposits. Ashton Moss, a peat bog, lies {{to the west of the}} town and was originally much larger. The River Tame forms part of the southern boundary, dividing the town from Stalybridge and Dukinfield, and the River Medlock runs to the west.|$|E
5|$|The early name, Bolton le Moors, {{described}} {{the position of}} the town amid the low hills {{on the edge of the}} West Pennine Moors southeast of Rivington Pike (456 m). Bolton lies on relatively flat land on both sides of the clough or steep-banked valley through which the River Croal flows in a southeasterly direction towards the River Irwell. The geological formation around Bolton consists of sandstones of the Carboniferous series and Coal Measures; in the northern part of Bolton the lower Coal Measures are mixed with underlying <b>Millstone</b> Grit.|$|E
5|$|The first {{alignment}} of the Route 92 Freeway, proposed in the 1950s, was to begin at an interchange with Interstate 95, known as the Somerset Freeway {{in the community of}} Skillman (in Montgomery Township). The route was supposed to head eastward, crossing an interchange with U.S. Route 206 in Montgomery Township before crossing over County Route 518 in Rocky Hill and interchanging with New Jersey Route 27 in Kingston. The route would then turn to the south and interchange with U.S. Route 1 and County Route 522 in the community of Monmouth Junction. From there, Route 92 would cross over the Pennsylvania Railroad to the north of New Jersey Route 64 in Plainsboro, turning to the southeast along the <b>Millstone</b> River. After crossing the <b>Millstone,</b> Route 92 was to interchange with County Route 535 in Cranbury before entering East Windsor, where it would interchange with U.S. Route 130. From there, the route would meet the New Jersey Turnpike at Interchange 8 before reaching its eastern terminus at an interchange with New Jersey Route 33 in the Twin Rivers community in East Windsor.|$|E
50|$|This was a corn mill. Originally {{powered by}} an {{internal}} breast shot waterwheel of some 14 ft by 6 ft driving {{one pair of}} French Burr <b>millstones</b> and one pair of Peak <b>millstones.</b> The great spur wheel was a cast iron wheel with wooden cogs. The waterwheel {{had been replaced by}} a turbine which drove the <b>millstones</b> via a great spur wheel that was only 3 ft diameter. The mill was house converted in 1971.|$|R

50|$|Pakenham Mill is a five storey tower mill. It has a domed {{cap with}} a gallery and is winded by a fantail. Two {{of the three}} pairs of <b>millstones</b> remain. The {{governors}} for the <b>millstones</b> are driven by chains instead of the more usual belt.|$|R
5|$|At the Battle of <b>Millstone,</b> Brigadier General Philemon Dickinson of the New Jersey militia {{scored a}} {{brilliant}} success. On 20 January 1777 near Van Nest's Mill, 400 militia and 50 Pennsylvania riflemen crossed an icy stream and fought a pitched battle with 500 British regulars and three cannons. The British lost 25 casualties, 12 prisoners, 43 wagons, 104 horses, 115 cattle and about 60 sheep. The Americans admitted losses {{of four or}} five men. Afterward, the British refused to believe that they had been beaten by militia. On 23 January two British regiments were waylaid by Brigadier General William Maxwell near Woodbridge. The 200 New Jersey Continentals inflicted losses of seven killed and 12 wounded while only suffering two men wounded.|$|E
5|$|Greater Manchester {{is mainly}} urban, {{and is one}} of the most densely {{populated}} regions in Europe. In the second half of the 18thcentury, the Industrial Revolution played an important role in the growth and development of Manchester and its surrounding area, and industry continues to be a major part of the region's economy. There are few buildings surviving from before the Industrial Revolution, but many from the 19th and 20thcenturies. The bedrock consists mainly of Carboniferous sandstones, including <b>millstone</b> grit, which is a major source of building material for the region's churches. The superficial deposits are of boulder clay, which provides material for making bricks.|$|E
5|$|Peat {{is found}} in thick, {{plentiful}} layers across the Pennines and Scottish Borders, {{and there are many}} large coalfields, including the Great Northern, Lancashire and South Yorkshire Coalfields. <b>Millstone</b> grit, a distinctive coarse-grained rock used to make millstones, is widespread in the Pennines, and the variety of other rock types is reflected in the architecture of the region, such as the bright red sandstone seen in buildings in Chester, the cream-buff Yorkstone and the distinctive purple Doddington sandstone. These sandstones also mean that apart from the east coast, most of Northern England has very soft water, and this has influenced not just industry, but even the blends of tea enjoyed in the region.|$|E
50|$|Quern and <b>millstones</b> from Hyllestad {{were widely}} distributed, and were parts of an {{international}} trade network in the Viking Age and the Middle Ages. Several wrecked cargoes with quern and <b>millstones</b> are found along the Norwegian coast. The stones from Hyllestad are found in large parts of Norway, {{but they were also}} exported to Sweden, Denmark, Northern Germany and the North Atlantic Islands. The distribution started c. 950, with an increase in the Middle Ages when Bergen acted as an important staple for quern and <b>millstones.</b>|$|R
50|$|The wooden {{brake wheel}} was of {{composite}} construction, 9 ft diameter. It had a wooden rim and a cast-iron centre with six arms. It {{had been converted}} from clasp arm construction. The Wallower was wooden, as was the Upright Shaft. The Upright Shaft {{was made up of}} four pieces of timber. The clasp arm Great Spur Wheel was of wood. It drove three pairs of underdrift <b>millstones,</b> with a fourth pair being driven by the waterwheel. The wind-driven <b>millstones</b> were all French Burr stones, two pairs being 4 ft diameter and the third pair being 4 ft diameter. Little is known about the waterwheel except that it was undershot and drove a single pair of <b>millstones</b> {{on the first floor of}} the mill, which was the same floor as the wind powered <b>millstones.</b>|$|R
50|$|The mill {{was built}} for James Nokes of Hunt's Farm in Corbets Tey Road in 1803 on land {{transferred}} from Bridge House Farm which was owned by his brother William. It had four Common sails and drove three pairs of <b>millstones.</b> A steam engine was added early in 1811 driving two pairs of <b>millstones,</b> an action which increased the rateable value of the mill from £30 to £77. A fourth pair of <b>millstones</b> {{was added to the}} mill. James Nokes died in 1838 and the mill passed to his son Thomas. A fifth pair of <b>millstones</b> had been added by 1849 when Thomas Nokes was bankrupt. By 1856 the mill was driving six pairs of <b>millstones</b> by wind and steam. Thomas Abraham purchased the mill in 1857, having previously been in the employ of Nokes at both West Thurrock windmill and Upminster. He had also been in business at a steam mill in Navestock for the previous two years. In 1876, the Upright Shaft was broken in an accident at the mill. It was repaired with a cast-iron coupling.|$|R
5|$|The {{different}} types of rock beneath the soil strongly influence the landscape; they determine the type of vegetation that will grow, and ultimately the type of animal that will inhabit the area. Limestone has fissures and is soluble in water, therefore rivers {{have been able to}} carve deep, narrow valleys. The rivers then often find routes underground, creating cave systems. <b>Millstone</b> Grit is insoluble but porous, absorbing water which seeps through the grits, until it meets the less porous shales beneath, creating springs where it reaches the surface. The shales are friable and easily attacked by frost and form areas that are vulnerable to landslides, as on Mam Tor.|$|E
5|$|Earl Thomas {{granted the}} manor to his steward, Robert de Holland, in February 1308. In 1311, Robert {{obtained}} a licence to crenellate from Edward II {{in order to}} fortify the manor house, and the more modest earlier building was converted into a castle between 1311 and 1322. Local tradition says that the stone was obtained from a quarry {{on the site of}} what is now Melbourne Pool. The records show £1,313 was spent on the project in the year 1313–14, of which £548 was paid to masons for dressing stone. Several masons working on the project were involved in an affray at Ravenstone in 1315. The important medieval buildings in Melbourne were constructed from the local bedrock, <b>Millstone</b> Grit. This is a coarsely grained sandstone which can be worked to produce good-quality ashlar. The village was centred around the church, castle and High Street until the late eighteenth century.|$|E
5|$|MD615 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} between <b>Millstone</b> Road, which continues east as a county highway, and the Exit5 ramp from westbound I-70 and US40 (Eisenhower Memorial Highway). The state highway heads west, closely paralleling I-70 and US40 to the south. At Hollow Road, MD615 has a ramp to eastbound I-70 and US40; the ramp also {{provides access to}} a parking lot for the Western Maryland Rail Trail and Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park. The highway continues west until it intersects the ramps to and from I-70 and US40 {{in the direction of}} Hancock. MD615's name changes to Heavenly Acres Ridge Road and curves north to climb out of the narrow valley of the Potomac River onto Heavenly Acres Ridge. The highway follows the ridge north to its terminus at an intersection with White Oak Ridge Road at the Pennsylvania state line. Heavenly Acres Ridge Road continues north as StateRoute2001 in southeastern Fulton County.|$|E

50|$|The <b>millstones</b> were {{supported}} on a cast iron cradle and below {{this were the}} belt-drives which transferred power from the waterwheel/motors to the stones. Five pairs of <b>millstones</b> were present. The 19th-century mill was used initially for grinding oats, and later for crushing peas and beans for use in animal feeds.|$|R
5|$|On 24 August, the Half Flight was {{augmented}} by four Martinsyde S1s and redesignated No.30 Squadron, Royal Flying Corps (RFC). The squadron moved into Kut following the city's capture by the Allies during the Battle of Es Sinn in September; {{for his part}} in the operation, Petre was again mentioned in despatches. Over the following two months, however, both Treloar and White were captured and became prisoners of war, leaving Petre as the only pilot remaining from the original Half Flight. Around the time of the Battle of Ctesiphon in November, he devised an implement shaped like a small garden rake that allowed him to accurately measure ground distances from the air in order to better map the desert terrain. During the Siege of Kut between December 1915 and April 1916, he flew a series of missions using crude parachutes to airdrop grain supplies (and a <b>millstone</b> for grinding), medical supplies and equipment to the town's entrapped garrison, which included nine of his AFC mechanics.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{crossing}} the <b>Millstone</b> River, US 1 enters Plainsboro Township, where it passes more business parks {{and comes to}} an interchange with Scudders Mill Road. Past Scudders Mill Road, the road runs {{to the west of}} the James Forrestal Campus of Princeton University before passing to the east of Forrestal Village. An interchange with College Road a short distance later provides access to both places. The route continues into South Brunswick Township, where it narrows to four lanes and runs through a mix of rural areas and development. US 1 briefly widens back to six lanes as it reaches an intersection with CR 522. Past CR 522, the surroundings of the four-lane road become more forested, with a few commercial establishments. The road briefly forms the border between South Brunswick Township to the northwest and North Brunswick Township to the southeast before fully entering North Brunswick Township.|$|E
5|$|Yazid-ibn-Mohalleb, {{a general}} under the Umayyads, was {{appointed}} {{the head of}} a great army to lead the Mazandaran expedition. On the way to Mazandaran, the general ordered captives to be hanged at {{the two sides of the}} road so that the victorious Arab army pass through. The attack on Tabarestan (present-day Mazandaran) failed, but he established his control in Gorgan. By the orders of Yazid-ibn-Mohalleb so many Persians were beheaded in Gorgan that their blood mixed with water would energize the <b>millstone</b> to produce as much as one day meal for him, as he had vowed. Extent of his brutality represented itself by running watermills by people's blood for three days and he fed his army with the bread made from that very bloody flour. But, Tabarestan remained invincible until the majority of Zoroastrians migrated towards India and the rest converted to Islam gradually.|$|E

50|$|The mill at Matahiwi {{was named}} Kāwana Kerei {{in honour of}} Governor Grey, who had donated the <b>millstones</b> as a {{personal}} gift to the Ngā Poutama people. It was built by local Māori and millwright Peter McWilliam using 13 m of totara logs, salvaged {{from the bottom of}} the river by 100 volunteers. The <b>millstones</b> from Melbourne and the cast-iron machinery and brass bearings from Britain were carried upstream by a fleet of 32 canoes. Over 200 workmen were needed to transport the <b>millstones</b> and machinery to the mill site, and they celebrated afterwards with a 'monster picnic' lasting several days.|$|R

5|$|The {{unitary state}} {{was not an}} end in itself, but a means to higher ends. The {{republic}} had been in dire financial straits even before the revolution of 1795. The system of public finance {{that had been the}} envy of the world in its Golden Age, enabling it to throw far beyond its weight in world politics up to the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, had become a <b>millstone</b> around its neck. By 1713 the public debt of the province of Holland had reached 310 million guilders; the debt of the Generality was 68 million; and the debts of the smaller provinces, and of the cities came on top of this. The debt service of Holland alone in that year required 14 million guilders, which exceeded its regular tax revenue. Most of this humongous public debt was held by Dutch private citizens, so in a sense it merely engendered an internal money circuit in the Dutch economy. However, it was mostly concentrated {{in the hands of the}} rentier class, while the debt was serviced by mainly regressive taxes that weighed on the working population. Most importantly, these were taxes levied by the individual provinces, who serviced their own debt, and paid into the Generality coffers according to a repartition schedule last changed in 1616. Attempts to reform this structure during the 18th century were mainly fruitless.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{crossing}} the <b>Millstone</b> River, Route 27 {{runs along the}} border of Franklin Township, Somerset County {{to the west and}} South Brunswick Township, Middlesex County to the east, passing through the historic community of Kingston. It continues northeast through a mix of woodland and residences, intersecting Promenade Boulevard, which heads east and becomes County Route 522 after crossing U.S. Route 1. Route 27 briefly runs entirely into Somerset County before resuming along the Middlesex/Somerset County border. The route continues north to an intersection with County Route 518 (Gateway Boulevard), where it resumes its northeast direction and heads into Kendall Park as a variable two- to four-lane road, entering denser suburban development. Route 27 then passes through Franklin Park, intersecting County Route 610 (Henderson Road). Past that intersection, Route 27 forms the border of Franklin Township to the west and North Brunswick Township to the east, passing through suburban development with some areas of farmland, seeing about 38,487 cars a day. The road forms the border of Franklin Township and New Brunswick upon intersecting County Route 680 (How Lane) becoming four-lane Somerset Street. Route 27 follows Somerset Street northeast through residential and commercial areas, passing by the community of Somerset {{on the west side of}} the road.|$|E
5|$|Having, in his view, perfected many of {{his ideas}} and designs for steam engines, Evans turned his {{attention}} once more to the commercial propagation of his inventions. His first steam engines had been constructed on an ad-hoc basis, often with improvised tools and workers, and he had relied heavily on blacksmiths and other metal-working shops in Philadelphia with little experience in the more precise metal-work required to build steam engines. In particular, Evans soon realized that unlike his milling machines of wood and leather he would need specialist skills, precision tools and a large foundry {{in order to build}} steam machines on a commercial basis. Thus, Evans constructed the Mars Works on a large site a few blocks north of his store in Philadelphia. The choice of name, after the Roman god of war, is thought to have been aspirational and a challenge to the Soho Foundry near Birmingham in the United Kingdom, famous for building the Watt and Boulton engines. Indeed, the completed Mars Works was {{one of the largest and}} best equipped outfits of its kind in the United States—by contemporary accounts it featured a substantial foundry, moldmaker's shop, blacksmith's shops, <b>millstone</b> maker, a steam engine works and a large steam engine of its own to grind materials and work wrought iron. With over thirty-five staff, the Mars Works produced a wide range of manufactures ranging from working steam engines to cast iron fittings, as well as milling and farming machines for Evans's now well-established agricultural clientele. Steam engine orders alone proved insufficient to support the extensive business costs; hence the works became highly experienced in producing all kinds of heavy machinery, contributing to Philadelphia's emergence as a leading center for such work in the 19th century. Indeed, the works even received military orders, casting naval cannons during the War of 1812. Evans also proved highly innovative in designing steam power solutions for his clients. In one example where the Mars Works was commissioned to build engines for wool processing factories in Middletown, Connecticut, Evans designed a network of accompanying pipes with radiators to heat the factory with engine exhaust.|$|E
