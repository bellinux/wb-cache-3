By then, {{not only had}} an economic recession and resulting tractor price war damaged such companies' finances, but also, the tractor market was evolving. Going forward, newer four-wheel designs (such as the Farmall), which would become {{what we now call}} the row-crop tractor category, would be the focus of the light farm tractor market. Two-wheel tractors would continue to have a place in agriculture both in the U.S. and around the world, but they would no longer compete in the same market segment as the larger four-wheel row-crop designs. However, the Allis-Chalmers Model G, introduced two decades later, was an interesting design that in some respects echoed the concept of the 6-12, albeit now [...] "facing the other way", with the implement leading and the <b>motorized</b> <b>drive</b> unit now pushing rather than pulling.|$|E

50|$|With the {{invention}} of the telescope, it became possible for astronomers to observe celestial objects in greater detail, provided that the telescope could be kept pointed at the object for a period of time. The easiest {{way to do that is}} to use an equatorial mount, which allows the telescope to be aligned with one of its two pivots parallel to the Earth's axis. A <b>motorized</b> clock <b>drive</b> often is used with an equatorial mount to cancel out the Earth's rotation. As the equatorial mount became widely adopted for observation, the equatorial coordinate system, which includes right ascension, was adopted at the same time for simplicity. Equatorial mounts could then be accurately pointed at objects with known right ascension and declination by the use of setting circles. The first star catalog to use right ascension and declination was John Flamsteed's Historia Coelestis Britannica (1712, 1725).|$|R
2500|$|The {{most common}} <b>motorized</b> vehicle <b>driven</b> in modern ranch {{work is the}} pickup truck.

It is used to pull stock trailers transporting cattle and livestock from one area to another and to market. With a horse trailer attached, it carries horses to distant areas where they may be needed. Motorcycles are sometimes used instead of horses for some tasks, but the most common smaller vehicle is the four-wheeler. It will carry a single cowboy quickly around the ranch for small chores. In areas with heavy snowfall, snowmobiles are also common. However, in spite of modern mechanization, there remain jobs, particularly those involving working cattle in rough terrain or in close quarters that are best performed by cowboys on horseback.|$|R
40|$|A cover {{mechanism}} {{for use on}} the Infrared Background Signature Survey (IBSS) cryostat was developed. The IBSS IR-instrument is scheduled for STS launch in early 1991 as a payload of the Shuttle Payload Satellite (SPS) 2.

When on orbit, the cover is opened to provide an unobstructed field of view for the IR-instrument. A positive seal is accomplished {{through the use of}} latch mechanism. The cover and the latch are driven by a common redundant actuator consisting of dc motors, spur gears, and a differential gear. Hall probe limit switches and position sensors (rotary variable transformer) are used to determine the position of the cover and the latch. The cover mechanism was successfully qualified for thermal vacuum (- 25 to 35 C), acoustic noise, vibration (6 Gs sine, 9. 7 G RMS) and life cycles.

40|$|Robots are primary {{candidates}} to perform dangerous but controlled missions. They carry cameras, surveillance instruments, and sensors {{to collect information}} and relay their findings to their human operators. Man is continuously challenged to seek uncharted territories such as outer space and the ocean’s depths. Robot data collection allows for an operator to collect data in environments where it may be unsafe for humans to do so. It also allows for humans to perform inconvenient and tedious tasks such as waiting, and collecting information {{over long periods of}} time. In this thesis, we propose to design and implement a test-bed platform, which may be used to control multiple Robots. These robotic platforms are essentially mobile wireless programmable robots with the processing power of a laptop computer. The robots consist of two mechanically <b>motorized</b> differential <b>drive</b> kinematics systems. We then discuss the capabilities of our platform with basic behaviors such as: path-to-goal, avoid-obstacle, maintain relative distance, maintain relative angle (formation), and maintain general speed to form a guidance algorithm. Furthermore we use the kinematic model of a two differential steering systems to derive the inverse kinematic equations, and generate any type of trajectory within the physical constrains of the system.

40|$|We {{describe}} here {{an automated}} {{system for the}} counting of multiple samples of double-stained microbial cells on sections of membrane filters. The application integrates an epifluorescence microscope equipped with <b>motorized</b> z-axis <b>drive,</b> shutters, and filter wheels with a scanning stage, a digital camera, and image analysis software. The relative abundances of specific microbial taxa are quantified in samples of marine picoplankton, as detected by {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) and catalyzed reporter deposition. Pairs of micro-scopic images are automatically acquired from numerous positions at two wavelengths, and microbial cells with both general DNA and FISH staining are counted after object edge detection and signal-to-background ratio thresholding. Microscopic fields that are inappropriate for cell counting are automatically excluded prior to measurements. Two nested walk paths guide the device across a series of triangular preparations until a user-defined number of total cells has been analyzed per sample. A backup autofocusing routine at incident light allows automated refocusing between individual samples and can reestablish the focal plane after fatal focusing errors at epifluorescence illumination. The system was calibrated to produce relative abundances of FISH-stained cells in North Sea samples that were comparable to results obtained by manual evaluation. Up to 28 preparations could be analyzed within 4 h without operator interference. The device was subsequently applied for the counting of different microbial populations in incubation series of North Sea waters. Automate...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the coordination of the head relative to the trunk within a gait cycle during gaze fixation. Nine normal subjects walked on a <b>motorized</b> treadmill <b>driven</b> at 1. 79 m/s (20 s trials) while fixing their gaze on a centrally located earth-fixed target positioned at a distance of 2 m from their eyes. The net and relative angular motions of the head about the three axes of rotations, as well as the corresponding values for the moments acting on it relative to the trunk during the gait cycle were quantified and used as measures of coordination. The average net moment, as well as the average moments about the different axes were significantly different (P 0. 01) throughout the gait cycle. The average angular displacement about the lateral bending axis was significantly increased (P< 0. 01) during the high impact phase while that about the flexion-extension axis was significantly decreased (P< 0. 01) throughout the gait cycle. Thus, the coordination of the motion of the head relative to the trunk during walking is dynamically modulated depending on the behavioral events occurring in the gait cycle. This modulation may serve to aid stabilization of the head by counteracting the force variations acting on the upper body that may aid in the visual fixation of targets during walking...|$|R
30|$|The {{study of}} the silver {{nanoparticle}} systems, by SERS spectroscopy, {{was carried out in}} macro- and micro-Raman configurations. The samples to be characterized by SERS spectroscopy were immersed, for 12 h, in methanol (or water) solution of rhodamine (R 6 G), with molarities of the order of magnitude of 10 - 4 M, and then dried by free evaporation of the solvent, for a few minutes. The Raman measurements were taken in ambient conditions. We have tried different wavelengths and have obtained optimum SERS spectra with the 514.5 -nm Ar+ laser line. For the macro-Raman measurements, a SPEX 1403 double monochromator with standard photon-counting system was used. For this series of measurements, we have used 20 -mW excitation beam power, focused by 75 -mm focal-length lens, either cylindrical or spherical, depending on the specific measurements. In this series of measurements, a fluctuation of the SERS intensity was observed, immediately after illumination with the laser beam. All the measurements were taken after a stabilization interval of half an hour after illumination, in order to overcome this effect, known as photobleaching. For the micro-Raman measurements, a JY T 64000 triple monochromator, with optical microscope of magnification up to × 100, and a liquid nitrogen-cooled CCD detector was used, equipped with <b>motorized</b> stepping <b>drive</b> motors for the scanning of the grating-like structures. For this series of measurements, an excitation beam power of 0.01 to 0.05 mW, was used, in order to minimize heating and photobleaching effects.|$|R
40|$|Mechatronics is a {{multidisciplinary}} and application oriented science. Fast prototyping of a complete, scaled mechatronic system is very useful both {{for research and}} teaching activities. This work describes {{the development of a}} scaled AGV, using fast prototyping techniques, both for the design of the mechanical components and the development of the vehicle control system. The scaled AGV is used as a scaled demonstrator to verify the feasibility of an anti-capsize controller. Capsize is a typical problem that have to be avoided on industrial vehicles, forklifts and moving lifter where heavy and partially unknown loads have to be moved using vehicles with a design that privilege manoeuvrability and small costs against stability. The AGV is a three wheeled differential drive mobile robot, with front <b>motorized</b> wheels, <b>driven</b> by speed-controlled drivers. The vehicle is controlled through a Texas Instrument C 2000 controller, programmable by using Matlab-Simulink Embedded Coder™. Forces exchanged between the wheels and the ground are monitored using low cost load cells. MEMS three-axial accelerometers and gyros are used to detect inertial loads and to estimate the vehicle pose and, through a proper filtering, the ground slope. The implemented strategy is able to identify the loading conditions of the vehicle by means of a dedicated algorithm. Once the vehicle is in motion, the controller, to prevent the vehicle capsize, is able to limit its forward speed without changing the geometry of the assigned trajectory.

40|$|A new {{facility}} {{has been developed}} at the Idaho National Laboratory for pressurized testing of solid oxide electrolysis stacks. Pressurized operation is envisioned for large-scale hydrogen production plants, yielding higher overall efficiencies when the hydrogen product is to be delivered at elevated pressure for tank storage or pipelines. Pressurized operation also supports higher mass flow rates of the process gases with smaller components. The test stand can accommodate cell dimensions up to 8. 5 cm x 8. 5 cm and stacks of up to 25 cells. The pressure boundary for these tests is a water-cooled spool-piece pressure vessel designed for operation up to 5 MPa. The stack is internally manifolded and operates in cross-flow with an inverted-U flow pattern. Feed-throughs for gas inlets/outlets, power, and instrumentation are all located in the bottom flange. The entire spool piece, {{with the exception of}} the bottom flange, can be lifted to allow access to the internal furnace and test fixture. Lifting is accomplished with a <b>motorized</b> threaded <b>drive</b> mechanism attached to a rigid structural frame. Stack mechanical compression is accomplished using springs that are located inside of the pressure boundary, but outside of the hot zone. Initial stack heatup and performance characterization occurs at ambient pressure followed by lowering and sealing of the pressure vessel and subsequent pressurization. Pressure equalization between the anode and cathode sides of the cells and the stack surroundings is ensured by combining all of the process gases downstream of the stack. Steady pressure is maintained by means of a backpressure regulator and a digital pressure controller. A full description of the pressurized test apparatus is provided in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Unless you {{are driving}} a hybrid car, where the energy {{normally}} lost in decelerations is stored as electric energy {{to be used}} in successive accelerations, speed increases of your vehicle are associated to extra fuel consumption. A few years ago we showed that the inherent increases/decreases of total mechanical energy of the body centre of mass during constant speed walking could explain the surprising invariant metabolic cost of transport when walking at oscillating speed. Here we present metabolic results of running at constant and oscillating speeds (11 ± 0, ± 1, ± 2, ± 3, ± 4 km. h- 1), with an acceleration/deceleration cycle lasting 6 s, performed by 9 subjects both on a motorized treadmill and on a 68 m diameter circular path as set by a moving spot projected by a laser attached to a <b>motorized</b> telescope, <b>driven</b> by a customly written software. It is expected from physics and physiology that such running protocol would imply an extra metabolic cost of transport C (J*kg- 1 *m- 1) = 4. 8 dv*dt- 1, where dv is the speed change (m*s- 1) and dt is its duration (3 s). Surprisingly again, we obtained substantial cost invariance even at the widest speed oscillation (C = + 6. 6 ± 7. 4 % rather than + 41. 9 %). Differently from walking, running mechanics include a portion of the total mechanical work related to the elastic energy (stored and) released by tendons. By taking this into account, it can be shown that the maximum speed oscillation compatible with cost invariance should be ± 4. 5 km*h- 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} of industrial vehicles, such as forklifts and lifters, {{is very important}} from a safety point of view: these vehicles are subjected to variable loading conditions and their design is often optimized to privilege handling in narrow spaces, instead of stability. To study in deep the problem of vehicle capsize prevention, the authors developed a scaled AGV (Automated Guided Vehicle). It is a three wheeled differential drive mobile robot, with front <b>motorized</b> wheels, <b>driven</b> by speed-controlled drivers. The position of the wheels and the loads can be easily modified to simulate different vehicle configurations and operating scenarios. The vehicle is controlled with a Texas Instrument C 2000 controller, programmable through Matlab-Simulink Embedded Coder™. In addition, the forces exchanged among the wheels and the ground are monitored using low cost load cells, with miniaturized amplification stages. MEMS three-axial accelerometers and gyros are installed in order to detect inertial loads and to estimate the vehicle pose and, through a proper filtering, the ground slope. The implemented strategy is {{able to identify the}} loading conditions of the vehicle by means of a dedicated algorithm: this algorithm evaluates the position of the center of mass from static measurements that are further refined when the vehicle is in motion with an adaptive filtering based on the fusion of both static and dynamic measurements.
