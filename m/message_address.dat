50|$|Another {{approach}} to reducing SMS spam that {{is offered by}} some carriers involves creating an alias address rather than using the cell phone's number as a text <b>message</b> <b>address.</b> Only messages sent to the alias are delivered; messages sent to the phone's number are discarded. A New York Times article provided detailed information on this in 2008. Another countermeasure {{is to use a}} service that provides a public phone number and publishes the SMS messages received at that number to a publicly accessible website. Google Voice can be used in this way, but with numbers and messages kept private. most cell phone providers offer the option of completely disabling all text messaging services on a user's account. This extreme solution, however, is satisfactory only for those users who have neither the need nor the desire to utilize SMS at all.|$|E

Implementing the filtering mechanism in the carrot/amqplib wrapper of OpenStack has advantages of both methods, and avoids unnecessary complexity. The OpenStack wrapper for managing AMQP messaging is implemented in src/nova/rpc.py. In order to identify the malicious message, we use the <b>message</b> <b>address</b> which is part of its context. Then, the actual dropping happens in the AdapterConsumer method. Assuming that the source address is set in the context variable, filtering is straightforward. By checking the <b>message</b> <b>address</b> and avoiding the method call, most of the task is done. The only remaining part is to inform the sender about the problem, this can be implemented by means of the existing message reply functionality.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe study atomic multicast, a {{fundamental}} abstraction for building fault-tolerant systems. We suppose a system composed of data centers, or groups, that host many processes connected through high-end local links; a few groups exist, interconnected through high-latency communication links. A recent paper showed that no multicast protocol can deliver <b>messages</b> <b>addressed</b> to multiple groups in one inter-group delay and be genuine, i. e., {{to deliver a}} message m, only the addressees of m {{are involved in the}} protocol. We propose a non-genuine multicast protocol that may deliver <b>messages</b> <b>addressed</b> to multiple groups in one inter-group delay. Experimental comparisons against a latency-optimal genuine protocol show that the non-genuine protocol offers better performance in almost all considered scenarios. We also identify a convoy effect in multicast algorithms that may delay the delivery of local messages, i. e., <b>messages</b> <b>addressed</b> to a single group, by as much as the latency of global messages, i. e., <b>messages</b> <b>addressed</b> to multiple groups, and propose techniques to minimize this effect.

40|$|In the “real world”, Photonics is {{somewhat}} invisible {{to those who}} rely upon it worldwide. We would like students to connect their everyday experiences of communications with the underlying ideas in Photonics. To do this, we have developed the Photonics Simulator to illustrate to high school students how text or information is coded into binary optical signals which are relayed through photonic communications networks from sender to receiver. Using our simulator, students construct a virtual network, and then test it by sending messages. The messages are coded using ASCII binary code as digital signals in data packets with address headers, which need to be switched, combined, amplified, or delayed {{to get to their}} designated address. The students must manage their power budget, correctly target each <b>message</b> <b>address,</b> and avoid collisions of data packets to send their messages uncorrupted and error-free. We tested an early version of the simulator with five Year 9 and 10 classes. The students provided many constructive comments and their feedback was used to improve the graphical interface of the simulator. We subsequently tested the simulator with 80 Year 9 students in short workshops. Overall we had a very positive response - it was more fun than a normal class, and interactivity helped students retain information. Students enjoy the visual aspects– they see how messages are delivered, and learn the function of each network component by experiment. Tests of the simulator at the Macquarie Siemens Science Experience were also encouraging, with one student even sneaking back to class to complete his challenges! 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The NTNU Test Satellite is double CubeSat {{being built}} at NTNU. The main payload of the {{satellite}} is a camera for earth observations. The satellite {{is based on a}} modular design with a "motherboard" style backplane where modules are placed in slots. In the current revisions of the backplane, lack of documentation and partially incomplete schematics combined with an increase in complexity over several iterations has made the task of realizing the backplane within an acceptable time-frame difficult. For data transfer the current backplane makes use of two parallel I 2 C buses for redundancy and a custom made arbitration bus for arbitration between the two OBCs (On-board Controllers) in the satellite. This results in a complex arbitration scheme having to be implemented in software with the potential of fault propagation over the arbitration bus between modules. A new design is proposed using CAN bus with built in arbitration with priority based on <b>message</b> <b>address.</b> Due to the robust nature of the CAN bus a single bus is considered able to replace the two I 2 C buses. In the current design control signals for the backplane are sent using a single wire custom serial bus implementation based on shift-registers. The proposed new design connects the control of utility functions and housekeeping on the backplane, such as module power management, to the CAN bus. A new schematic design for the backplane is presented and test methodology suggested. The design is partially assembled on breadboard and tested. Lastly a partial hardware test and verification is presented before a conclusion is reached on the reduced complexity and future ease of implementation when it comes to board layout and production...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Finding {{persons who}} are {{knowledgeable}} on a given topic (i. e. Expert Search) has become an active area of recent research [1 – 3]. In this paper we investigate the related task of Intelligent <b>Message</b> <b>Addressing,</b> i. e., finding {{persons who are}} potential recipients of a message under composition given its current contents, its previously-specified recipients or a few initial letters of the intended recipient contact (intelligent auto-completion). We begin by providing quantitative evidence, from a very large corpus, of how frequently email users are subject to <b>message</b> <b>addressing</b> problems. We then propose several techniques for this task, including adaptations of wellknown formal models of Expert Search. Surprisingly, a simple model based on the K-Nearest-Neighbors algorithm consistently outperformed all other methods. We also investigated combinations of the proposed methods using fusion techniques, which leaded to significant performance improvements over the baselines models. In auto-completion experiments, the proposed models also outperformed all standard baselines. Overall, the proposed techniques showed ranking performance of more than 0. 5 in MRR over 5202 queries from 36 different email users, suggesting intelligent <b>message</b> <b>addressing</b> can be a welcome addition to email. ...|$|R
