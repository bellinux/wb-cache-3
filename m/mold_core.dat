50|$|The {{impregnated}} tows {{are then}} literally wound around a mandrel (<b>mold</b> <b>core)</b> {{in a controlled}} pattern to form {{the shape of the}} part. After winding, the resin is then cured, typically using heat. The <b>mold</b> <b>core</b> may be removed or may be left as an integral component of the part(Rosato, D.V.).This process is primarily used for hollow, generally circular or oval sectioned components, such as pipes and tanks. Pressure vessels, pipes and drive shafts have all been manufactured using filament winding. It has been combined with other fiber application methods such as hand layup, pultrusion, and braiding. Compaction is through fiber tension and resin content is primarily metered. The fibers may be impregnated with resin before winding (wet winding), pre-impregnated (dry winding) or post-impregnated. Wet winding has the advantages of using the lowest cost materials with long storage life and low viscosity. The pre-impregnated systems produce parts with more consistent resin content and can often be wound faster.|$|E

USE - For forming and removing a <b>mold</b> and/or <b>core</b> during a casting procedure, e. g. for casting a light metal alloy. ADVANTAGE - The <b>molds</b> and/or <b>cores</b> and their residues are removed from the casting in a very simple manner. Highly dimensionally stable, but readily removable, core structures can be obtained, in the case of complex geometry (e. g. fine filigree) structures as well as large volume structures. The castings are totally free of sand <b>mold</b> and/or <b>core</b> residues which could cause problems during subsequent use (e. g. by disrupting coolant flow in the case of cast engine housings). The hollow particles are readily suspended in liquids to give flowable suspensions; provide strong, accurately shaped, low porosity <b>molds</b> or <b>cores</b> of high surface quality; and collapse to very fine particles which are easily rinsed out with water...|$|R

40|$|Abrasive flow machining(AFM) is an {{effective}} method that can remove the recasting layer produced by wire electrical discharge machining(WEDM). However, the surface roughness will not be easily uniform when a complex hole is polished by this method. CFD numerical method is aided to design good passageways to find the smooth roughness on the complex hole in AFM. Through the present method, it reveals that the shear forces in the polishing process and the flow properties of the medium in AFM play the roles in controlling the roughness on the entire surface. A power law model was firstly set up by utilizing the effect of shear rates on the medium viscosities, and the coefficients of the power law would be found by solving the algebraic equation from {{the relations between the}} shear rates and viscosities. Then the velocities, strain rates and shear forces of the medium acting on the surface would be obtained in the constant pressure by CFD software. Finally, the optimal <b>mold</b> <b>core</b> put into the complex hole could be designed after these simulations. The results show that the shear forces and strain rates change sharply on the entire surface if no <b>mold</b> <b>core</b> is inserted into the complex hole, whereas they hardly make any difference when the core shape is similar to the complex hole. Three experimental types of <b>mold</b> <b>core</b> were used. The results demonstrate that the similar shape of the <b>mold</b> <b>core</b> inserted into the hole could find the uniform roughness on the surface. © 2009 The Nonferrous Metals Society of China. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

The geometric features of functional elements of the <b>mold</b> (<b>core,</b> cavity, side core, etc.) are evaluated for manufacturability using fuzzy-analytic hierarchy process (Fuzzy-AHP) methodology.

40|$|Abstract. For higher {{geometrical}} accuracy {{requirement of}} optical lens, much {{research has been}} conducted either by changing the injection process parameters or changing the material of the mold or the mold manufacturing process. Although some degree of improvements was achieved, those were occasional but not-repeatable. One conventional procedure has been: the injection <b>mold</b> <b>core</b> must be polished several times to obtain qualified lens product in preproduction trial, very uneconomical and inefficient. In this paper, modern engineering tools were applied to simplify the correction process in optical lens fabrication. Combining virtual manufacturing with reverse engineering technology, the method was demonstrated very powerful. For the optical lens of 70 x 29. 1 mm in this research, the maximum deviation from the flatness after regular plastic injection molding was 0. 208 mm. While with combined technology of VM and RE the error was reduced to 0. 008 mm only by once iteration with an improvement of 96. 15 %. Not only the technology could be extended to larger or more challenging lens fabrication, it could also be applied to curved surfaces. This is really great tool to achieve higher quality optical lens production with much lower expending in labor and funding. 1...|$|E
40|$|Complex three {{dimensional}} parts can {{be manufactured}} directly from CAD data using rapid prototyping processes. SLS ® Selective Laser Sintering is a rapid prototyping process {{developed at the}} University of Texas at Austin and commercialized by DTM Corporation. SLS parts are constructed layer by layer from powdered materials using laser energy to melt CAD specified cross sections. Polymer, metal, and ceramic powders are all potential candidate materials for this process. In this paper, a commercial SLS process- the RapidTool Process- which allows metal molds to be rapidly manufactured is described. With this process, a polymer coated carbon steel powder is used to fabricate a "green part " in the SLS machine. The green part is then placed in a furnace with blocks of copper and, in a single furnace cycle, the polymer coating is removed and the steel skeleton is infiltrated with the copper. The resulting steel/coPPer composite material has durability and thermal conductivity similar to aluminum and can be hand finished using standard techniques. A finished <b>mold</b> <b>core</b> and cavity set {{which can be used}} to mold at least 50, 000 parts with most plastics can be prepared in approximately ten days.

40|$|By {{composing}} {{a cooling}} channel just near the mold surface using the milling-combined laser metal sintering method, cooling during injection is promoted and the cooling time is reduced. In order to evaluate this effect, a cone with ribs inside {{the upper part}} is picked up. A spiral-cooling channel is fabricated along the side surface of the <b>mold</b> <b>core</b> and also between the ribs in the upper part. To compare with this, a steel mold with machined baffle channels was made. The diameter of {{the upper part of}} the molded cone was chosen as an evaluation dimension. The temperature on the upper surface of the core is kept low at around the cooling water temperature in the case of sintered mold during the cycle of the injection. On the other hand, the temperature on the upper surface of the steel mold increases far higher than the cooling water temperature. Cycle time for the same shrink ratio in {{the upper part of the}} molded cone was 25 s in the sintered mold and 40 s in the steel mold. Owing to the cooling time reduction, cycle time of the injection molding was reduced 35 % by using the sintered mold with cooling channels.

40|$|Carbon fiber {{reinforced}} plastic (CFRP) manufacturing often is an expensive, time-consuming small-scale production {{where most of the}} products and components are characterized by complex geometric properties. Especially for hollow components it is necessary to use removable mold cores, which are typically made of low-melting metal alloys, and used to shape the inner contour of the component. To improve the time-consuming and costly process of mold-making, this paper describes the application of additive manufacturing (i. e. 3 D-printing) for the production of mold cores. The outstanding advantage of additive manufacturing is the very flexible production out of a CAD model without further tools. In the provided case study materials for additive manufacturing were selected and tested for their suitability to manufacture mold cores. For this purpose an exemplary <b>mold</b> <b>core</b> was produced with different additive manufacturing methods and used in common carbon fiber production processes. Since curing in the autoclave places the highest demands on the core, this process has been selected to test the mold cores. A special focus was on the analysis of the dimensional stability and accuracy by measuring the deviations of the inner cores after the autoclave cycle. The analysis was performed by using optical metrology utilising stripe light projection. Finally this case study shows that additive manufacturing can lead to an increase in efficiency in the CFRP production but also that further scientific research and technological development are needed to realize the indicated potentials...|$|E
