40|$|AbstractObjectives: Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} {{continues to}} be a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Complacency by the medical profession and by patients has caused a new strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to emerge that is highly resistant to current antibiotics. The possibility of a new worldwide epidemic of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis is of concern. Optimal therapy for patients infected with <b>multi–drug</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> often requires surgical intervention to eradicate the infection. We report on our experience with pulmonary resection for <b>multi–drug</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>tuberculosis.</b> Methods: During a 17 -year period, 172 patients underwent 180 pulmonary resections. All patients had <b>multi–drug</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> and had a minimum of 3 months of medical therapy before surgery. Muscle flaps were frequently used to avoid residual space and bronchial stump problems. Results: During the study period, 98 lobectomies and 82 pneumonectomies were performed. Eight patients underwent multiple procedures. Operative mortality was 3. 3 % (6 / 180). Three patients died of respiratory failure, 2 patients died of a cerebrovascular accident, and 1 patient had a myocardial infarction. Late mortality was 6. 8 % (11 / 166). Significant morbidity was 12 % (20 / 166). One half (91) of the patients had positive sputum at the time of surgery. After the operation, the sputum remained positive in only 4 (2 %) patients. Mean length of follow-up was 7. 6 years (range 4 - 204 months). Conclusions: Surgery remains an important adjunct to medical therapy for the treatment of multi–drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In the setting of localized disease, persistent sputum positivity, or patient intolerance of medical therapy, pulmonary resection should be undertaken. Pulmonary resection for <b>multi–drug</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> can be performed with acceptable operative morbidity and mortality.

40|$|<b>Multi-drug</b> <b>resistant</b> (MDR) <b>{{tuberculosis}}</b> {{is defined}} as disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis with resistance to at least two anti-tubercular drugs Isoniazid and Rifampicin. Recent surveillance data have revealed that prevalence of the drug <b>resistant</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> has risen to the highest rate ever recorded in the history. Drug <b>resistant</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> generally arises through the selection of mutated strains by inadequate therapy. The most powerful predictor {{of the presence of}} MDR-TB is a history of treatment of TB. Shortage of drugs {{has been one of the}} most common reasons for the inadequacy of the initial anti-TB regimen, especially in resource poor settings. Other major issues significantly contributing to the higher complexity of the treatment of MDR-TB is the increased cost of treatment. Other factors also play important role in the development of MDR-TB such as poor administrative control on purchase and distribution of the drugs with no proper mechanism on quality control and bioavailability tests. Tuberculosis control program implemented in past has also partially contributed to the development of drug resistance due to poor follow up and infrastructure. The association known for centuries between TB and poverty also applies to MDR-TB, a rather significant inverse association with MDR-TB. Various treatment strategies have been employed, including the use of standardised treatment regimens based upon representative local susceptibility patterns, empirical treatment based upon previous treatment history and local Drug Susceptibility Test (DST) patterns, and individualised treatment designed on the basis of individual DST results...|$|R

Against this background, the effectiveness of treatment of patients suffering from <b>multi-drug</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> of the lungs in our country remains very low, mainly due to the toxic adverse reactions to antimycobacterial drugs of the reserve line, and in the case of adding diabetes mellitus, it deteriorates even more.

In {{some parts of}} the world 10 % or more of new TB cases are MDR. The Beijing genotype is a distinct genetic lineage of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is distributed worldwide, and has caused large outbreaks of MDR-TB. It has been proposed that certain lineages of M. tuberculosis, such as the Beijing lineage, may have specific adaptive advantages. We have investigated the presence and transmission of DR Beijing strains in the Swedish population. Methodology/Principal Findings: All DR M. tuberculosis complex isolates between 1994 and 2008 were studied. Isolates that were of Beijing genotype were investigated for specific resistance mutations and phylogenetic markers. Seventy (13 %) of 536 DR strains were of Beijing genotype. The majority of the patients with Beijing strains were foreign born, and their country of origin reflects the countries where the Beijing genotype is most prevalent. Multidrug-resistance was significantly more common in Beijing strains than in non-Beijing strains. There was a correlation between the Beijing genotype and specific resistance mutations in the katG gene, the mabA-inhA-promotor and the rpoB gene.
