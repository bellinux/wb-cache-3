Owing to his capabilities, I kept him on as <b>my</b> <b>secretary</b> without suspecting that he was an informer for the French.|$|E

In fact, the mayor's exact words were, [...] "But many also cannot park, like <b>my</b> <b>secretary.</b> Five times she tried and no success.” [...] On a final note, to add a comical touch, these men-only parking spaces were even marked with [...] "Mars" [...] symbols.|$|E
