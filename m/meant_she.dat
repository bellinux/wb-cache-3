5|$|A {{total of}} twelve {{entrants}} competed for Team GB {{in the three}} equestrian disciplines {{that took place in}} Hong Kong. Zara Phillips, the reigning world eventing champion and granddaughter of Queen Elizabeth II, had been included in the squad until her horse, Toytown, sustained an injury, which <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> missed her second successive Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{publication}} of Summer Cooking, David was wooed away from her regular column in Harpers by Vogue magazine, which offered her more money and more prominence—a full central page with a continuing column following, and a full page photograph. The new contract <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> also wrote for Vogues sister magazine House & Garden. Audrey Withers, the editor of Vogue, wanted David to write more personal columns than she had done for Harper's, and paid her £20 a month for food ingredients {{and from time to time}} £100 for research trips to France.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the choice}} of her next feature, Hepburn decided to star in George Cukor's new project, Sylvia Scarlett (1935), which paired {{her for the first}} time with Cary Grant. Her hair was cut short for the part, as her {{character}} masquerades as a boy for much of the film. Critics disliked Sylvia Scarlett and it was unpopular with the public. She next played Mary Stuart in John Ford's Mary of Scotland (1936), which met with a similarly poor reception. A Woman Rebels (1936) followed, a Victorian era drama where Hepburn's character defied convention by having a child out of wedlock. Quality Street (1937) also had a period setting, this time a comedy. Neither movie was popular with the public, which <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> had made four unsuccessful pictures in a row.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>meant</b> Alceste. <b>She</b> <b>meant</b> {{that he was}} severe. <b>She</b> <b>meant</b> that <b>she</b> could deceive him.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>meant</b> to go, <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> to go, <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> to go. Nothing {{would stop}} her, {{and she was}} {{prepared}} to face the consequences. Suppose her father turned her out of doors! She did not care, <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> to go. <b>She</b> would just {{walk out of the}} house and go....|$|R

5|$|In 2004, Forbes named Rowling as {{the first}} person to become a U.S.-dollar billionaire by writing books, the second-richest female {{entertainer}} and the 1,062nd richest person in the world. Rowling disputed the calculations and said she had plenty of money, but was not a billionaire. The 2016 Sunday Times Rich List estimated Rowling's fortune at £600million, ranking her as the joint 197th richest person in the UK. In 2012, Forbes removed Rowling from their rich list, claiming that her US$160 million in charitable donations and the high tax rate in the UK <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> was no longer a billionaire. In February 2013 she was assessed as the 13th most powerful woman in the United Kingdom by Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4.|$|E
5|$|On Saturday, 5 October 1985, a {{week after}} the Brixton riot, police arrested Floyd Jarrett, a 24-year-old black man from Tottenham, on {{suspicion}} of being in a stolen car. It was a suspicion {{that turned out to be}} groundless, but a decision was made several hours later to search the home of his mother, Cynthia Jarrett, for stolen goods. In the course of the search she collapsed and died of heart failure. Rose writes that the pathologist, Walter Somerville, told the inquest that Mrs Jarrett had a heart condition that <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> probably only had months to live.|$|E
5|$|The Yugoslav monitor Vardar was a Sava-class river monitor {{built for}} the Austro-Hungarian Navy as SMS Bosna, but was renamed SMS Temes (II) before she went into service. During World War I she was the {{flagship}} of the Danube Flotilla, and fought the Serbian Army, the Romanian Navy and Army, and the French Army. She reverted to the name Bosna in May 1917, after the original SMS Temes was raised and returned to service. After brief service with the Hungarian People's Republic {{at the end of}} the war, she was transferred to the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia), and renamed Vardar. She remained in service throughout the interwar period, although budget restrictions <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> was not always in full commission.|$|E

5|$|The Yugoslav monitor Sava was a Temes-class river monitor {{built for}} the Austro-Hungarian Navy as SMS Bodrog. She fired the first shots of World War I {{on the night of}} 28 July 1914, when she and two other {{monitors}} shelled Serbian defences near Belgrade. She was part of the Danube Flotilla, and fought the Serbian and Romanian armies from Belgrade to the mouth of the Danube. In the closing stages of the war, she was the last monitor to withdraw towards Budapest, but was captured by the Serbs when she grounded on a sandbank downstream from Belgrade. After the war, she was transferred to the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia), and renamed Sava. She remained in service throughout the interwar period, although budget restrictions <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> was not always in full commission.|$|E
5|$|Thirty-seven athletes {{represented}} Team GB in {{the swimming}} events. Selection followed the 2008 British Olympic Swimming Trials in Sheffield in April, with open water event swimmers selected after {{performance in the}} 2008 World Open Water Swimming Championships, in Seville, Spain. In winning six medals (two gold, two silver and two bronze) the team bettered the target of three medals set by UK Sport. The most successful swimmer was Rebecca Adlington who won two gold medals. Her 400m freestyle success was Britain's first Olympic swimming title since 1988, and the first swimming gold by a British woman since 1960. Her second gold, in the 800m freestyle, <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> also equalled the best performance by a British woman, from any sport, at the summer Olympics and was the best swimming performance by a Briton at the Olympics for 100 years.|$|E
25|$|In 2004 Dagne {{finished}} {{less than}} a minute behind the first Briton, a relatively unknown, Tracey Morris in the London Marathon. This performance <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> just missed out on a trip to the 2004 Olympic Games.|$|E

6000|$|... "She {{does what}} she can, {{and she has}} talent, and she looked lovely. But she doesn't SEE Nona Vincent. She doesn't see the type--she doesn't see the individual--she doesn't see the woman you <b>meant.</b> <b>She's</b> out of it--she gives you a {{different}} person." ...|$|R
25|$|By {{winning the}} 1998 US Open title, Hingis {{completed}} the doubles Career Grand Slam, becoming the 17th female player {{in history to}} achieve this, {{as well as the}} youngest. It also <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> completed the Calendar Year Grand Slam, becoming the fourth woman in history to achieve the feat.|$|E
25|$|Blomqvist turned {{professional}} late in 2003 and in 2004 claimed {{her maiden}} victory in only her second tournament {{as a professional}} at the Pam Golding Ladies International on the Nedbank Women's Golf Tour in South Africa following this up with a win in the Telkom Women's Classic a week later. These results <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> finished top of the Nedbank Women's Golf Tour Order of Merit for 2004.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, Nixon {{created the}} show's most iconic character: Rachel Davis (first played by Robin Strasser {{and later by}} Victoria Wyndham). Rachel was raised by her single mother, Ada (Constance Ford), who {{provided}} a good foil for Rachel. Down-to-earth Ada could sit in her kitchen on Bowman Street and be perfectly content with her life. Rachel, on the other hand, was a schemer who was determined to escape her impoverished background, even if it <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> {{had to resort to}} underhanded means.|$|E
60|$|He {{kissed her}} silently. There really was anguish in her tone, {{and he was}} frightened. It had never {{occurred}} to him that <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> what <b>she</b> said quite, quite seriously.|$|R
60|$|And <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> what <b>she</b> said. The {{madness of}} remorse and disappointment, so {{common in the}} wild middle age, had come over her; {{and with it the}} twin madness of self-torture.|$|R
6000|$|... "Recollect yourself, Gerald, {{you know}} <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> that <b>she</b> had {{put you in}} mind that you ought not; and don't you think that, true or not, your speech was very rude?" ...|$|R
25|$|Barty then {{travelled}} to USA {{playing a}} series of ITF tournaments and the WTA tournament in Charleston. She had limited success in singles with her best result being a semi-final finish in the $25,000 ITF tournament in Pelham. In doubles, however, she continued to perform well, reaching a WTA semi-final in Charleston with (w/Anastasia Rodionova) which <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> had reached the semi-finals in all three WTA doubles tournaments she had entered. She also won ITF titles in Pelham (w/ Arina Rodionova) and Innisbrook (w/ Alize Lim).|$|E
25|$|Soghoghtani's husband Tolui, whose appanages {{included}} eastern Mongolia, {{parts of}} Iran and North China, {{died at the}} age of 40 in 1232. Ögedei Khan, Genghis's third son who had succeeded his father, gave her enduring authority to handle Tolui's estates. The Secret History suggests that Ögedei may have consulted Sorghaghtani on various matters, and he always held her in high regard. Ogedei appointed her in charge of the Empire's administration, which <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> played a pivotal role in securing the lands won under Genghis Khan.|$|E
25|$|Abe's {{encounter}} with the geisha world {{proved to be a}} frustrating and disappointing one. To become a true star among geisha required apprenticeship from childhood with years spent training and studying arts and music. Abe never progressed beyond a low rank, at which one of her main duties was to provide sex for clients. She worked for five years in this capacity, and eventually contracted syphilis. Since this <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> would be required to undergo regular physical examinations, as would a legally licensed prostitute, Abe decided to enter that better-paying profession.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then Blackbeard is a liar," [...] said Toolooha quietly, though {{without a}} {{thought of being}} rude. <b>She</b> merely <b>meant</b> what <b>she</b> said, and said what <b>she</b> <b>meant,</b> being a {{naturally}} candid woman.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{talked a}} great deal about him, {{especially}} Anne Cox. I do not know what <b>she</b> <b>meant,</b> but <b>she</b> asked me if I thought I should go and stay there again next summer." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{she made}} it quite clear not only to Jobbet (which was easy), but to every {{one else in the}} village, {{including}} young Caddles, that in this matter, as in all things, <b>she</b> <b>meant</b> what <b>she</b> said.|$|R
25|$|She {{successfully}} defended her U.S. Women's Open {{title in}} 2001 {{and won the}} LPGA Championship to become the youngest winner of the LPGA Career Grand Slam. She teamed with David Duval to play against Annika Sörenstam and Tiger Woods in a made-for-TV Battle at Bighorn between the two best male and two best female players in the world. At the time, it provided women's golf its largest audience ever. Webb's win at the 2002 Women's British Open, which had become an LPGA major in 2001, <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> completed a Super Career Grand Slam – every available major championship in women's golf in her career.|$|E
25|$|Wells was {{allegedly}} {{drawn into the}} plot through Barnes, whom he knew through Diehl-Armstrong. The plot was hatched to get funds to pay Barnes enough money to kill Diehl-Armstrong's father, so that Diehl-Armstrong would receive an inheritance, according to authorities. However, Wells had only stolen $8,702, far from the $125,000 needed for the killing. Furthermore, the inheritance Diehl-Armstrong reportedly coveted was ultimately denied to her. Her father's estate had once been valued near $2 million, but gifts to friends had lowered the value to less than $200,000 at his death. Additionally, his {{last will and testament}} left only $2,000 to Diehl-Armstrong, yet the estate's obligation to pay outstanding medical bills before inheritances <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> received nothing.|$|E
25|$|At the 1986 Asian Games the 21-year-old Isozaki {{was entered}} to defend all her titles. She ran her {{individual}} finals faster {{than she had}} done four years earlier, but the standard of women's sprinting in Asia had improved and this <b>meant</b> <b>she</b> was fifth in the 200m and third in the 400m. P. T. Usha succeeded Isozaki in both disciplines with another Indian, Shiny Abraham, finishing ahead of the Japanese sprinter in the 400m. The Japanese short relay team fell to fifth in the rankings but the national long relay team remained competitive as Isozaki anchored home a quartet including Keiko Honda, Koshimoto and Ayako Arai to the silver medal behind the Indian women.|$|E
6000|$|... "Punishment?" [...] {{repeated}} Heyst. He {{could not}} understand what <b>she</b> <b>meant.</b> When <b>she</b> explained, he was still more surprised. [...] "A sort of retribution, from an angry Heaven?" [...] he said in wonder. [...] "On us? What on earth for?" ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Kendal {{looked as}} much amused as he ever did, {{but no one}} else gave the least token of so much as knowing what <b>she</b> <b>meant,</b> and <b>she</b> felt {{as if she had been}} making a foolish attempt at wit.|$|R
