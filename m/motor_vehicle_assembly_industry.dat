5|$|In 2004, {{the number}} of people {{employed}} in the <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>industry</b> in Ohio was reported to be around 31,000, down from about 40,000 throughout the 1990s, while in the motor vehicle parts production industry in Ohio, in December 1997, employment stood at approximately 122,000 employees; however, that number dropped by about 26% to 90,000 employees by 2004. Despite the growth facts above, the loss of employment is more likely to directly affect Ohio's economy. The Ohio Bureau of Labor Market Information estimates that there will be 3,300 less assembly employees and 2,400 less parts manufacturing employees in 2012 than 2002. Major firms operating in the state include Ford, Honda, and General Motors. Some major motor vehicle assembly production plants in the state include the Toledo Complex, Lordstown Assembly, Marysville Auto Plant, East Liberty Auto Plant, Ohio Assembly, and Toledo North Assembly.

40|$|This study investigates {{whether there}} are {{productivity}} effects through international technology transfer in the Turkish automotive parts industry. Being at sector level, previous studies cannot account for heterogeneities across sectors and within sectors. Before conducting this investigation, this study develops a more accurate measure of technological intensity for individual automotive parts, namely patent counts enabling identification of technological and economic characteristics of the industry. Focusing mainly on the <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>assembly</b> section of the industry, previous case studies have not thoroughly examined the automotive parts supply section. Hence, this study does not only enhance the understanding of both <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>assembly</b> and automotive parts supply sections of the industry, but it also provides insights into technological and economic relations of the global automotive industry with a developing economy. This study reveals first that the Turkish automotive <b>industry</b> is a <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>assembly</b> hub integrated well with the European automotive value chain. Second, higher the technological intensity of an automotive part, greater the import of that automotive part becomes, whereas smaller the export of that automotive part becomes in Turkey during 2002 - 2013. On the other hand, there is not clear technological intensity concentration on automotive parts produced in Turkey during 2005 - 2012, to some extent, reflecting the recent R&D efforts pursued by the industry to build up technological capability. Third, automotive parts supplying enterprises with international linkages in Turkey are more productive, pay more and employ more during 2003 - 2011. Therefore, this study argues {{that the government should}} specifically promote design and R&D activities, and international economic interactions of automotive parts suppliers more that increasingly constitute a larger section of the industry...|$|R

40|$|The global {{automotive}} {{supplier industry}} {{is undergoing a}} major restructuring and consolidation. The defining characteristics of the industry in the year 2000 and beyond will be fewer suppliers {{at all levels of}} the supply chain, but especially among the ranks of direct suppliers to the <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> manufacturers. Direct suppliers will consist primarily of systems integrators that are capable of designing, manufacturing and delivering complete modules to <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>assembly</b> plants. Many of the systems integrators will have global reach. Since there will be relatively few systems integrators, suppliers that do not become an integral part of a systems integrator must either carve out a position as an indirect supplier in the supplier hierarchy that evolves or leave the business. In order to remain part of the automotive supplier base in the long term all suppliers must decide where they will best fit in the supplier hierarchy and determine what they must do to survive the transition and position themselves to thrive after the restructuring and consolidation of the supply base is complete. In this paper the options available to Canadian suppliers and the strategies that some of them are following to position themselves in the year 2000 and beyond are explored.

40|$|The <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{industry}} in the U. S. spends about $ 3. 6 billion on energy annually. In this report, we focus on auto assembly plants. In the U. S., over 70 assembly plants currently produce 13 million cars and trucks each year. In assembly plants, energy expenditures is a relatively small cost factor in the total production process. Still, as manufacturers face an increasingly competitive environment, energy efficiency improvements can provide a means to reduce costs without negatively affecting the yield or {{the quality of the}} product. In addition, reducing energy costs reduces the unpredictability associated with variable energy prices in today?s marketplace, which could negatively affect predictable earnings, an important element for publicly-traded companies such as those in the <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> industry. In this report, we first present a summary of the <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>assembly</b> process and energy use. This is followed by a discussion of energy efficiency opportunities available for assembly plants. Where available, we provide specific primary energy savings for each energy efficiency measure based on case studies, as well as references to technical literature. If available, we have listed costs and typical payback periods. We include experiences of assembly plants worldwide with energy efficiency measures reviewed in the report. Our findings suggest that although most <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> companies in the U.

Further research on the economics of the measures for individual assembly plants, as part of an energy management program, is needed to assess the potential impact of selected technologies at these plants...|$|R
5000|$|In 1963, Rootes {{introduced}} the Hillman Imp, a compact rear-engined saloon with an innovative all-aluminium OHC engine, {{based on a}} Coventry Climax engine design (originally used for a fire pump). It {{was intended to be}} a response from Rootes to rival BMC's popular Mini, and a new factory in Linwood, Renfrewshire was built for its assembly. The move to Linwood was forced upon the company by the British government, which had {{introduced the}} principle of [...] "industrial development certificates" [...] (IDCs) to build factories in depressed areas. The Linwood workforce had no experience in <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>assembly</b> and the build quality and reliability of the cars suffered. Another problem was that the component suppliers were still based in the Midlands, and the company incurred costs transporting half-finished engine castings from Linwood to be machined at Ryton and returned to Linwood once they had been assembled. Completed Imps returned south to Ryton, resulting in a 600 mi round trip.The Imp itself was underdeveloped, and the build quality and reliability problems, coupled with buyer apathy towards the design were reflected in poor sales. After a reasonably successful start in 1963-65, the Imp did not sell well. Lost production caused by frequent strike action at Linwood and escalating warranty claims left Rootes no money to develop other models.|$|R

It focuses upon a case study of Volkswagen’s bus and truck plant and its workers at Resende. The plant opened in 1996 on a green-field site and was presented as a major development in <b>vehicle</b> <b>assembly.</b> The unique feature of the plant’s production system rests on the relationship between the assembler (VW) and its component suppliers. At Resende these were involved in a joint enterprise to establish a «modular system » of production. In this system, the component suppliers finance a part of the factory and organise the assembly of their components on site. As such few of the production workers are employed by the assembler whose main role in the process is to co-ordinate production and market the vehicle. The restructuring of production and new ways of managing the workforce in Brazil have been accelerated {{since the beginning of the}} 1990 ’s, by the increase in foreign investment in industrial activities and the need for firms to compete in the world market.
