[...] On November 9, 2012, the first regular season for Frazier as a senior, he logged his 19th career 20-point game against Saint Francis (PA).

It was announced that he had a recovery period of about 12 months and would be out for the season. The injury was described as a [...] "devastating blow" [...] to the program by ESPN.com writer Eamonn Brennan. Chambers addressed the situation, saying, [...] "I have no doubt he will meet this challenge and will again be one of the top players in the nation," [...] in accordance to his potential fifth year of NCAA eligibility. Frazier redshirted the season shortly after it was announced by the school that he would undergo surgery. He said, [...] "I will never forget that game, that injury, never forget that camera. I'm sitting there on the sideline with the (television) camera just zooming in on my foot. I'll never forget the look on my sister's face, <b>my</b> <b>mom</b> <b>and</b> dad's face." [...] During his rehabilitation, Frazier began using the elliptical machine, doing work in the swimming pool, and taking part in weight training. He was guided by Penn State's athletic trainer, Jon Salazer, throughout the process. Frazier's sister Krystal had torn her right Achilles tendon when playing college basketball nearly seven years prior, and had gone through a similar rehabilitation before resuming her playing career.|$|E
