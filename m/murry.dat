5|$|The {{film was}} a Powers Picture Plays {{directed}} by Edwin August and {{distributed by the}} Universal Film Manufacturing Company. The film's production number was 0101. The screen play was written by Jeanie MacPherson who also {{played the role of}} The Girl. Simon Louvish, author of Cecil B. DeMille: A Life in Art, states this uncredited screenplay {{was the first one to}} be authored by MacPherson. Louvish also refers to this film as a two-reeler. Lon Chaney and Robert Z. Leonard had previously worked together for the Ferris Hartman Troupe. Three years prior to the release of the film, the two were involved in the production of musical comedies for the Troupe. In 1918, Leonard would later direct his wife, Mae <b>Murry,</b> and Lon Chaney in Danger, Go Slow.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the Cardinals were {{wavering}} between starting <b>Murry</b> Dickson or Harry Brecheen in game two, {{while the}} Dodgers {{were looking to}} use either Higbe, who had pitched in the previous game, or Joe Hatten; the two clubs went with Dickson and Hatten. Hatten began {{the game in the}} top of the first inning by only allowing one hit to Terry Moore. In the bottom of the first, the Dodgers scored the game's first run. After Eddie Stanky struck out, and Dick Whitman flied out, Augie Galan singled. He was brought home by a walk and another single. After Carl Furillo flied out, the first inning ended with a score of 1–0. In the top of the second, the Cardinals responded when Erv Dusak tripled after a Slaughter ground out. Marty Marion hit a sacrifice fly to score Dusak, and after a single by Clyde Kluttz, Dickson tripled to score another run, giving St. Louis a 2–1 lead, before a fly out ended their half of the inning. Dickson walked Bruce Edwards, but retired the next three batters, leaving the score 2–1 at the end of the second inning.|$|E

5|$|On November 14 VanVleet tallied 7 steals in {{the opener}} against New Mexico State, which tied a school record. On December 3, against #25 Utah VanVleet, helped Wichita State recover from a 9-point deficit in the final 2:45 of {{regulation}} with 8 points (including two three-point shots in the final 1:15) and an assist on a three-point shot, but with 7 seconds remaining in overtime and Wichita trailing by one, he missed {{the front end of}} a one and one. In his return visit to Chicago and the Gentile Center to play Loyola on January 11, he again was perfect from the field with a 5-for-5 performance and added a career-high tying 10 assists (as well as 6 rebounds and 3 steals) for his first career double-double. VanVleet, however, snapped his perfect streak of 20 free throws made in his home state with a 3-for-4 performance. In the rematch against Loyola on January 28, VanVleet posted a career-high 27 points. On February 7, VanVleet posted the first triple double for Wichita State Shockers men's basketball in 43 years with a 10-point 10-rebound 11-assist 4-steal performance against Missouri State. On February 16, VanVleet was Missouri Valley Conference Co-Player of the Week (with Seth Tuttle). On February 26, VanVleet broke the all-time Wichita State career assist record against Evansville with 431 assists, surpassing Warren Armstrong who had 429 and Toure <b>Murry</b> who had 430. VanVleet was one of 17 finalists for the Cousy Award. The Shockers defeated Northern Iowa on February 28 to win the Missouri Valley Conference regular season title. In the opening game of the 2015 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament for the Shockers, VanVleet matched a career high with 27 points against Indiana. He finished the tournament with 17-point and 25-point performances against #2-seeded Kansas and #3-seeded Notre Dame, respectively.|$|E
25|$|This series {{follows the}} lives of Meg <b>Murry,</b> her {{youngest}} brother Charles Wallace <b>Murry,</b> and their friend Calvin O'Keefe {{as they try to}} save the world from evil forces. The remaining <b>Murry</b> siblings, twins Sandy and Dennys <b>Murry,</b> take up the struggle in one volume from which the other protagonists are largely absent. A further book about Polly O'Keefe, the eldest child of Meg and Calvin, features several characters from the other novels and completes the Time Quintet.|$|E
25|$|Vicky Austin is {{the most}} {{frequent}} protagonist in the fiction of Madeleine L'Engle, filling that function in four novels and two shorter works. Meg <b>Murry</b> is the protagonist of three books (arguably sharing that function with Charles Wallace <b>Murry</b> in one of these), while Polly O'Keefe, although she appears in four novels, is the protagonist in only two of them.|$|E

25|$|In October 1912 the {{publisher}} of Rhythm, Charles Granville (sometimes known as Stephen Swift), absconded to Europe and left <b>Murry</b> responsible for the debts the magazine had accumulated. Mansfield pledged her father's allowance towards the magazine, but it was discontinued, being reorganised as The Blue Review in 1913 and folding after three issues. Mansfield and <b>Murry</b> were persuaded by their friend Gilbert Cannan to rent a cottage next to his windmill in Cholesbury, Buckinghamshire in 1913, {{in an attempt to}} alleviate Mansfield's ill health. In January 1914 the couple moved to Paris, in the hope that a change of setting would make writing easier for both of them. Mansfield wrote only one story during her time there ("Something Childish But Very Natural") before <b>Murry</b> was recalled to London to declare bankruptcy.|$|E

25|$|M. pristinus {{was first}} {{described}} and named by Maurice G. Mehl in 1928 as the type species of Pseudopalatus, Pseudopalatus pristinus, {{on the basis}} of the holotype MU 525, nearly complete skull. It was collected, from the Norian-aged Upper Petrified Forest Member of the Chinle Formation, near Adamana, Arizona. Additional skulls and postcranial material, some articulated skeletons, from the same member were referred to this species by Colbert (1946) and Long and <b>Murry</b> (1995) from Arizona, and by Lawler (1979), Ballew (1986) and Long and <b>Murry</b> (1995) from New Mexico. Charles Camp (1930) described and named Machaeroprosopus tenuis {{on the basis of}} UCMP 27018, a nearly complete skull, lower jaws, and some complete postcranial material, from the Billings Gap locality (UCMP 7043, Upper Petrified Forest Member), Apache County of Arizona. This specimen was occasionally referred to as Rutiodon tenuis, although since Long and <b>Murry</b> (1995) it is considered to be a junior synonym of M. pristinus. Long and <b>Murry</b> (1995) also suggested that Redondasaurus gregorii from the Redonda Formation of New Mexico is a junior synonym of M. pristinus, although this was not accepted by subsequent authors. Other, then unnumbered, specimens from the upper Church Rock Member (Chinle Formation, Utah), Bull Canyon Formation and Travesser Formation (New Mexico) and Cooper Canyon Formation (Texas), were referred to M. pristinus by Long and <b>Murry</b> (1995), although recent studies suggest that M. pristinus is currently known only from the Upper Petrified Forest Member of Arizona and New Mexico.|$|E

His mother is a very cranky, tired woman with too many children. Neglected by his own family, Calvin joyfully enters the lives of the <b>Murry</b> family, starting in Chapter Two. He also loves Meg <b>Murry.</b> He shows some signs of being able to communicate telepathically, the same power Charles Wallace seems to have, a technique referred to in later books as kything. He also feels as if he has been hiding his true self all his life, and likes the <b>Murry</b> family much more than his own, which is characterized by abuse and dysfunctional dynamics. Calvin also supported Meg through the adventure.|$|E
