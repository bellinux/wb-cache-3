40|$|Respondents, Dedric Holman and Christina Edwards, were {{gambling}} at the Gold Coast Hotel when {{a physical}} confrontation arose between John Nittinger, a security guard, and Holman. When Holman tried to run, security officers pursued him {{and held him}} to the ground. According to Holman’s testimony, the guards made racial slurs, punched, kicked and beat him. The security shift supervisor was present during part of the incident. The district court instructed the jury that it could find the Gold Coast liable for punitive damages if a “managerial agent” authorized or ratified the guards’ conduct. The jury awarded respondents $ 198, 000 in compensatory damages from the security guards and the Gold Coast. The jury also awarded the respondents $ 371, 000 in punitive damages from the Gold Coast. On appeal, appellant Gold Coast argued that because the security shift supervisor was not a <b>managerial</b> <b>agent,</b> {{it could not be}} liable for punitive damages. The Nevada Supreme Court agreed, therefore reversing the imposition of punitive damages on the Gold Coast...|$|E
40|$|As an {{organizational}} form, franchising has evolved {{to the point}} where it now accounts for 38 % of all retail sales in the U. S. This unqualified success of the franchise form can be attributed to its inherent strategic advantages. The most central of these strategic advantages is economies of scale. But scale, and the ensuing spatial preemption, are only attained through the acquisition of external financial resources and <b>managerial</b> <b>agents.</b> Once attained, scale economies and the enforcement of quality standards can lead to internal growth through an integrated lowcost and differentiation-based competitive advantage.

40|$|For several decades, American {{corporate}} scholars {{assumed the}} inevitability of the widely held Berle and Means 2 ̆ 7 corporation. The argument was simple. In a rapidly developing industrial economy, economic prosperity dictated the infusion of massive amounts of capital into owner-managed corporations. Without ample capital, entrepreneurs {{would be unable to}} realize the scale economies or technological innovations necessary for industrial growth. The rub in the story, however, was that to raise the necessary capital, owner-managers had to sell off equity interests. Inevitably, the pressure for capital meant that ownership ended up being dispersed among numerous small stakes shareholders. With ownership fractured, sundry collective action problems subverted the capacity of shareholders to wield effective control over their <b>managerial</b> <b>agents,</b> which, in tum, meant efficiency losses from sub-optimal resource utilization. Recently, however, recognition of the survival of concentrated share ownership corporations in other countries, namely Germany and Japan and even in the United States, has caused American scholars to reconsider their commitment to the evolutionary inevitability of the Berle and Means 2 ̆ 7 corporation. No longer the byproduct of innate economic forces, the American corporation has of late been viewed by many as merely path dependent, more particularly the result of a confluence of political, historical and cultural factors. Perhaps the most important was the restriction barring financial intermediaries from holding or voting ownership interests in commercial companies. Had these barriers not been created, ownership may have come to reside in sophisticated large stakes shareholders, who were much more likely than retail investors to control <b>managerial</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|R

Obviously, this is more of a matter for the higher <b>managerial</b> positions. <b>Agents</b> operating abroad should be especially prudent.

40|$|Managerial {{ownership}} and firm performance are endogenously determined by exogenous (and only partly observed) {{changes in the}} firm’s contracting environment. To develop the testable hypothesis {{the extension of the}} cross-sectional results runed by Demesetz and Lehn (1985) (Journal of Political Economy, 93, 1155 - 1177) has been used and the panel data been used to show that managerial ownership is explained by key variables in the contracting environment in a way consistent with the predictions of principal-agent models. A large fraction of the cross-sectional variation in managerial ownership is explained by unobserved firm heterogeneity. Moreover, after controlling both for observed firm characteristics and firm fixed effects; it cannot be concluded (econometrically) that changes in <b>managerial</b> ownership <b>agent</b> firm performance...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} why the price of nontradables relative to tradables is positively correlated with income per worker. I construct a two-sector model in which agents differ with respect to <b>managerial</b> ability. <b>Agents</b> sort themselves by choosing to become a worker, a manager in nontradables, or a manager in tradables. A fixed cost of exporting places the most productive managers in the tradable sector, and the magnitude of the fixed cost determines the extent of this margin. Fixed costs together with trade costs determine the amount of competition across sectors which in turn determines prices across sectors. The calibrated model explains more than 60 % of the cross-country differences in the relative price of nontradables, due to the presence of larger fixed costs in poor countries combined with nontrivial import costs. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This study {{presents}} an inquiry {{on the historical}} evolution of the uniforming movement in cost accounting and its current position in the lodging sector. Its paramount objective is ‘to learn from the past' and, at the same time, to pose a question of future: where are aiming the current techniques of cost management in the lodging industry to? A specific purpose of this inquiry was fixed, {{on the base of}} a necessary retrospective look, in outlining and analyzing the actual accounting informative needs of today’s hotel complexes, considering the two main directions that hotel accounting has taken throughout its (long) history in search of uniformity. A uniform purpose that, from 1926 on, the successive versions of the USAH - Uniform System of Accounts for Hotels has being pursuing (an acronym modified in 1996 as USALI - Uniform System of Accounts for Lodging Industries). Design/methodology: This work composes of two parts differentiated and clearly interconnected: • In a first study it examines the movement uniform system in its most dynamic period, as they were the years between the two WW (1920 - 1940), its aims and most outstanding contributions, its economic and politician circumstances, social influences, etc. • In a second study the interest is focused in the current period and specifically in the Spanish lodging industry, where, by means of the method of the survey and personal interviewing, it aims to evaluate and interpret the degree of need perceived by the <b>managerial</b> <b>agents</b> of the sector about an accounting uniform movement in Spain. Findings: The inquiry offers two types of contributions and results: on the one hand, a reconfiguration of the role exerted by the ‘uniforming’ movement in the history of management accounting; on the other hand, it makes evident, by means of a field inquiry, which are the main informative needs of the lodging sector in Spain, beyond a mere sectorial adaptation of the current general plan of accounting. Originality/value: The authors have focused their inquiry on the big evolutionary lines that have given fruit in the different versions of the USALI, considering its utility as the starting point for a hypothetical system of accounting management adjusted to the needs and idiosyncrasy of the Hispanic sector. One of the main conclusions that can be extracted is that, either by looking at the review of the past or by summarizing the analysis of the present needs, the evidence shows that the European hotel industry faces a pending task that the North American tradition has been successful to channel in a way comparatively more advanced: the fact of having a complete and uniform instrument of accounting information...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedMy {{dissertation}} {{covers a}} hitherto overlooked {{dimension of the}} classical Hollywood film industry: the role of talent agents in the 1930 s and 1940 s, the formative years of the studio system. Through extensive primary archival research I have unearthed the strong function served by talent agents in the studio system of the 1930 s and 1940 s. Drawing on recent work in economics, economic sociology and theories of institutions, my project broadens and complicates traditional depictions of the studio era. I trace the syndicate of <b>managerial</b> roles [...] <b>agents</b> in particular, but studio executives as well [...] that constituted the studio "system" {{as much as the}} concentrated management within the major film production companies. I demonstrate the social connections that translated into business relationships and how this system aided and abetted the individual reputations of stars, directors, and writers [...] as well as the reputations of the agents themselves. Thus, my project, in addition to documenting the early history of agents, adds a new theoretical perspective on agency within the studio system...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{establishes}} {{the existence of}} a stationary equilibrium and a procedure to compute solutions to a class of dynamic general equilibrium models with two important features. First, occupational choice is determined endogenously as a function of heterogeneous agent type, which is defined by an <b>agent’s</b> <b>managerial</b> ability and capital bequest. Heterogeneous ability is exogenous and independent across generations. In contrast, bequests link generations and the distribution of bequests evolves endogenously. Second, there is a financial market for capital loans with a deadweight intermediation cost and a repayment incentive constraint. The incentive constraint induces a non convexity. The paper proves that the competitive equilibrium can be characterized by the bequest distribution and factor prices, and uses the monotone mixing condition to ensure that the stationary bequest distribution that arises from the agent’s optimal behavior across generations exists and is unique. The paper next constructs a direct, non-parametric approach to compute the stationary solution. The method reduces the domain of the policy function, thus reducing the computational complexity of the problem. ...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} competition on <b>managerial</b> incentives when <b>agents</b> have private information about the firms' productivities. Two types of firms are considered: managerial firms (delegation) and entrepreneurial firms (no delegation). Due to the asymmetry of information managerial firms are less efficient (productive efficiency) than entrepreneurial firms and entrepreneurial firms competition may actually reduce the managerial firms' productive inefficiency. When a non-profit maximizing firm (managerial type) {{is present in the}} market, the net effect in terms of social welfare is ambiguous: if the number of competing firms is high enough to introduce a non-profit maximizer is not worthwhile since the extra cost in terms of informational rent is not outweighed by sufficiently high increase of the quantity produced. The non-profit maximizing firm introduces a trade-off between allocative efficiency and productive inefficiency. Under the assumption of imperfect correlation we show that expected social welfare is a decreasing function of the correlation degree between firms' productivities. Moreover managerial informational rents are larger when firms' productivities are positively correlated. Mixed oligopoly; Delegation; Asymmetry of information...|$|R
