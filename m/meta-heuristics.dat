Most real-world systems involve con-straints, so improving algorithms for covering array generation (CAG) with constraints is beneficial. Two popular methods for constrained CAG are greedy construction and <b>meta-heuristic</b> search. Recently, a <b>meta-heuristic</b> framework called two-mode local search has shown great success in solving classic NP-hard problems.

40|$|Abstract: Scheduling {{is one of}} {{the core}} steps to {{efficiently}} exploit the capabilities of heterogeneous distributed computing systems and represents an NP-complete problem. Therefore, using <b>meta-heuristic</b> algorithms is a suitable approach in order to cope with its difficulty. In many <b>meta-heuristic</b> algorithms, generating individuals in the initial step has an important effect on the convergence behavior of the algorithm and final solutions. Using some pure heuristics for generating one or more near-optimal individuals in the initial step can improve the final solutions obtained by <b>meta-heuristic</b> algorithms. Pure heuristics may be used solitary for generating schedules in many real-world situations in which using the <b>meta-heuristic</b> methods are too difficult or inappropriate. Different criteria can be used for evaluating the efficiency of scheduling algorithms, the most important of which are makespan and flowtime. In this paper, we propose an efficient pure heuristic method and then we compare the performance with five popular heuristics for minimizing makespan and flowtime in heterogeneous distributed computing systems. We investigate the effect of these pure heuristics for initializing simulated annealing <b>meta-heuristic</b> approach for scheduling tasks on heterogeneous environments...|$|R

30|$|Exploration and {{exploitation}} are two essential concepts of <b>meta-heuristic</b> algorithms.

On the other hand, the aim of exploitation is to create new solutions based on the solutions which have previously been found during the search process. If a <b>meta-heuristic</b> algorithm just focuses on exploration, it acts like a random search algorithm which is a highly inefficient way to search the solution space. On the other hand, if a <b>meta-heuristic</b> algorithm just focuses on exploitation, it is not able to efficiently discover and search all regions of solution space.
