50|$|Like {{other species}} of the genus Loxosceles, bites from the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>recluse</b> <b>spider</b> can have {{dangerous}} effects, causing skin lesions - a condition known as loxoscelism. Despite co-occurrence with humans for millennia, {{there is only a}} single report of a human fatality linked to a bite from this species, a case report from 2016 in which no spider was captured for a confirmed identification, and in which the victim suffered from an autoimmune disorder (myasthenia gravis).|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} and most famous species in the United States is the brown recluse spider (Loxosceles reclusa). It is found in a large area of the Midwest, west to Colorado and the New Mexico state line and east to {{northern}} Georgia. Sporadic records from other locations only represent incidental introductions, not established populations. The brown recluse feeds on whatever small prey is available, and has been observed to prefer scavenging over actively hunting. Other notable members of this genus include the Chilean recluse spider (L. laeta) and the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>recluse</b> <b>spider</b> (L. rufescens).|$|E
40|$|Background: Brown <b>recluse</b> <b>spider</b> bites cause {{significant}} trauma via their tissue toxic venom. Diagnosis {{of these}} injuries and envenomation {{is difficult and}} many times presumptive. Treatment is varied and dependent upon presentation and course of injury. Materials and Methods: We present {{a case of a}} previously unreported incidence of osteomyelitis of the mandible {{as a result of a}} brown <b>recluse</b> <b>spider</b> bite. A review of the literature and discussion of diagnosis and treatment of brown <b>recluse</b> <b>spider</b> bites are presented. Results: Osteomyelitis of the mandible causing a chronic wound was the presenting finding of a patient with a history of spider bite and exposure to brown <b>recluse</b> <b>spiders.</b> Operative debridement and wound closure resulted in successful treatment. Brown <b>recluse</b> <b>spider</b> envenomation varies in its presentation and treatment is based on the presenting clinical picture. Conclusion: Treatment regimens for brown <b>recluse</b> <b>spider</b> bite envenomation should include the basics of wound care. Systemic antibiotics, topical antimicrobials, dapsone, and surgical debridement are valuable adjuncts of treatment, as indicated, based on the clinical course. Brown <b>recluse</b> <b>spider</b> bite envenomation can be a significant traumatic injury. Probabl...|$|R
50|$|Even if {{the tiger}} spider {{is famous for}} preying on the <b>recluse</b> <b>spider,</b> University of Chile's {{studies have shown that}} only 50% of {{encounters}} between the two kinds of spider result in a fight between them, out of which only 75% result in the tiger spider actually killing the <b>recluse</b> <b>spider.</b> The title of natural predator of the <b>recluse</b> <b>spider</b> is therefore open to doubt.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>recluse</b> <b>spiders</b> {{or brown}} spiders, genus Loxosceles (...) , {{also known as}} fiddle-backs, violin spiders, or reapers, are a genus of venomous spiders known for their bite, which {{sometimes}} produces a characteristic set of symptoms known as loxoscelism. <b>Recluse</b> <b>spiders</b> are now identified {{as members of the}} family Sicariidae, having formerly been placed in their own family, the Loxoscelidae. Although <b>recluse</b> <b>spiders</b> have a bad reputation, they are usually not aggressive.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{whether the number of}} brown <b>recluse</b> <b>spider</b> bites diagnosed by South Carolina physicians coincides with evidence of brown <b>recluse</b> <b>spiders</b> found in the state. Methods: Brown <b>recluse</b> <b>spider</b> bite diagnosis data were extracted from 1990 and 2004 surveys of South Carolina physicians. This was compared with the known historical evidence of brown recluse spi-ders collected in South Carolina and derived from various sources, including state agencies, arachnolo-gists, and museum specimens. Results: South Carolina physicians diagnosed 478 brown <b>recluse</b> <b>spider</b> bites in 1990 and 738 in 2004. Dating to 1953, 44 brown <b>recluse</b> <b>spider</b> specimens have been verified from 6 locations in South Carolina. Discussion: The number of brown recluse bites reportedly diagnosed in South Carolina greatly out-numbers the verified brown recluse specimens that have been collected in the state. The pattern of bite diagnoses outnumbering verified brown recluse specimens has been reported in other areas outside of this spider’s known endemic range. (J Am Board Fam Med 2007; 20 : 483 – 488.)

40|$|The venom of Loxosceles reclusa (Brown <b>Recluse</b> <b>spider)</b> {{can cause}} a severe, {{life-threatening}} hemolysis in humans for which no therapy is currently available in the USA beyond supportive measures. Because this hemolysis is uncommon, relatively {{little is known about}} its clinical manifestation, diagnosis, or management. Here, we aimed to clarify the clinical details of envenomation, to determine the efficacy of the complement inhibitor eculizumab to prevent the hemolysis in vitro, and to investigate markers of exposure to Brown Recluse venom. We performed a 10 -year chart review of cases of Brown <b>Recluse</b> <b>spider</b> bite-mediated hemolysis at our institution. We also designed an in vitro assay to test the efficacy of eculizumab to inhibit hemolysis of venom exposed red blood cells. Finally, we compared levels of CD 55, CD 59 and glycophorin A on venom exposed versus venom-naïve cells. Most victims of severe Brown <b>Recluse</b> <b>spider</b> mediated hemolysis at our institution are children and follow an unpredictable clinical course. Brown <b>Recluse</b> <b>spider</b> bite mediated hemolysis is reduced by 79. 2 % (SD= 18. 8 %) by eculizumab in vitro. Erythrocyte glycophorin A, but not CD 55 or CD 59, is reduced after red blood cells are incubated with venom in vitro. Taken together, our laboratory data and clinical observations indicate that L. reclusa venom exposure results in non-specific antibody and complement fixation on red blood cells, resulting in complement mediated hemolysis that is curtailed by the complement inhibitor eculizumab in vitro. Glycophorin A measurement by flow cytometry may help to identify victims of L. reclusa envenomation...|$|R
