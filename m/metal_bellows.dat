50|$|The <b>metal</b> <b>bellows</b> {{accumulators}} function {{similarly to}} the compressed gas type, except the elastic diaphragm or floating piston {{is replaced by}} a hermetically sealed welded <b>metal</b> <b>bellows.</b> Fluid may be internal or external to the bellows. The advantages to the <b>metal</b> <b>bellows</b> type include exceptionally low spring rate, allowing the gas charge to do all the work with little change in pressure from full to empty, and a long stroke relative to solid (empty) height, which gives maximum storage volume for a given container size. The welded <b>metal</b> <b>bellows</b> accumulator provides an exceptionally high level of accumulator performance, and can be produced with a broad spectrum of alloys resulting in a broad range of fluid compatibility. Another advantage to this type {{is that it does not}} face issues with high pressure operation, thus allowing more energy storage capacity.|$|E

30|$|Phase {{changes in}} materials, {{resulting}} from temperature changes, produce huge volume changes, especially in liquid/gas phase changes. This attribute is utilized {{to provide a}} power source for micro-pumps and valves in combination with MEMS (micro-electromechanical system) heaters, micro-channels, diaphragms, and membranes [1 – 10]. Kato et al. used this phenomenon to provide a power source for actuators and robots. They made a <b>metal</b> <b>bellow</b> actuator to control cutting equipment and a pipe inspection robot [11, 12]. Phase change is used not only in actuators but also in some kinds of pressure sources. For example, Kitagawa et al. used the triple point of carbon dioxide as a mobile pressure source [13], and Shibuya et al. developed a buoyancy control device for underwater robots using paraffin oil [14].|$|R
40|$|Accumulators {{are used}} in lots of applications. So they are used as a {{pressure}} accumulator for quick energy supply to hold a constant pressure (equalization of leakage), for pulsation damping and as an element of suspension. We can differ between 3 types of accumulators: 1. Diaphragm Accumulator, 2. Piston Accumulator 3. <b>Metal</b> <b>Bellow</b> Accumulator. At applications with high requirements to permeation the diaphragm accumulators are equipped with so called multi-layer diaphragms. During test series some of these accumulators failed because of big gas losses. At a first look, no external damage could be seen, so that the damage was assumed in the internal layer. In this contribution {{the results of a}} detailed X-ray based non-destructive testing (NDT) of accumulator membranes are reported. This includes digital X-ray fluoroscopy using a Philips Computed Radiography (PCR) system as well as conventional and micro CT investigations. ...|$|R

The necessity of dynamic quality increase for {{automatic control system}} of the hydrostatic bearing {{with the use of}} correcting means in the form of RC-chains is shown. The features of correction parameters choice coming from the existence of the crossing connections in automatic control system structure are noted. We propose the block diagram of automatic control system of the hydrostatic bearing in Simulink working field and cyclic algorithm for determination program of RC-chain parameters implemented in MATLAB taking into account typical thermal processes for the finishing treatment. Graphic-analytical method for the correction parameters choice is presented based on the stability stock phase gradient for dynamic quality determination of automatic control system. Researches of the method estimability in case of using the standard <b>metal</b> <b>bellow</b> valve as the hydrocapacity for RC-chain are also carried out. Recommendations for the bellow valve choice are formulated. The check of dynamic quality indicators concerning transition processes calculated by means of the appropriate programs developed for MATLAB is performed.

40|$|Abstract — Electrodeposition of {{polypyrrole}} {{was carried}} out on aluminum coated silicon substrates using various counter electrodes in the galvanostatic mode. It {{was found that the}} counter electrode plays a vital role along with the working electrode in the electrodeposition of polypyrrole. The electrodeposited films were studied under Atomic Force Microscope in contact mode. There were significant differences in the morphology of the PPy/TBACF 3 SO 3 films electrodeposited using different counter electrode material. The counter electrodes used were Ti, stainless steel, Ni, Pt and Au. This study reveals that Pt counter electrode gives very uniform and well grown PPy films while stainless steel is the best cost effective choice when a low grown but uniform film is needed. Index Terms—AFM study, conducting polymer, active metals, counter electrode, film morphology, surface morphology effect of counter electrode material on film morphology and this study revealed that the choice of counter electrode with respect to the working electrode is very important for the electrodeposition process. For this study, a metal in the upper side of the electrochemical activity series (an active metal) has been chosen as the working electrode and different <b>metals</b> <b>bellow</b> it in the same series were chosen as counter electrodes to analyze the morphological changes of films. Therefore, in this study electrodeposition of polypyrrole(PPy) {{was carried out}} on aluminum coated silicon wafer using Tetra-n-Butylammonium Trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TBACF 3 SO 3) as dopant and methyl benzoate as solvent with Ti, stainless steel(SS), Ni, Pt and Au as counter electrodes in galvanostatic mode.

50|$|The axial {{expansion}} joint absorbs movement in an axial direction. Standard connectors of the {{axial expansion}} joint are welded ends, fixed flanges and loose flanges. Axial expansion joints are often equipped with a guiding tube {{on the inside of}} the <b>metal</b> <b>bellows.</b> This reduces the flow resistance and prevents damage caused by direct contact with the flowing medium. Axial expansion joints, which can absorb large movements, frequently consist of two <b>metal</b> <b>bellows</b> and an inside or outside sleeve that protects against buckling under internal pressure. For small nominal diameters, protective tubes prevent mechanical damage during installation and operation. Axial expansion joints are suitable for internal and external overpressure. If pressure is applied to the outside of the <b>metal</b> <b>bellows</b> of {{axial expansion joint}}s, the expansion joints permit very large axial movements in case of internal pressure in a pipeline. Because there is no danger of buckling when an external overpressure is applied, the creator of the metal expansion joint was by a professor called Joshua Yap.|$|E

500|$|Free reed aerophone: The musical {{pipe organ}} {{employing}} <b>metal</b> piston <b>bellows</b> {{had a long}} history in the West, dating back to the Hellenistic period. However, the Western pipe organ did not make use of the reed, which the ancient Chinese mouth organ employed. The latter instrument, called a sheng and made traditionally of bamboo pipes, was first mentioned in the Shi Jing of the Zhou Dynasty (c. 1050–256 BC). The Chinese sheng is considered the ancestor of the harmonica, harmonium, concertina, accordion, and [...] A free reed organ was invented in the Arab world in the 13th century, while the German organ builder Heinrich Traxdorf (fl. 15th century) of Nuremberg built one around 1460 AD.

50|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>bellows</b> {{are created}} by rolling annular {{corrugations}} into a smooth extruded or welded pipe. In 1946, Albert Dreyer developed a multi-walled joint {{that was designed to}} accommodate axial movements as well: the axial expansion joint.|$|E
5000|$|Emil Witzenmann was {{considered}} the inventor of expansion joints. [...] In 1920, he applied for a patent for the first so-called flexible metal tube expansion joint, German Reichspatent No. 367 185, from 29 July 1920. From a technical point of view, this precursor of today's expansion joints is a large, pressure-tight flexible metal hose with a defined, restricted freedom of movement. In the 1930s, the 'metal hose' or 'flexible metal tube' principle {{was replaced by the}} <b>metal</b> <b>bellows</b> as the central functional element.

50|$|Expansion joints {{are often}} {{included}} in industrial piping systems to accommodate movement due to thermal and mechanical {{changes in the}} system.

5000|$|Mechanical seals are {{generally}} classified into two main categories: [...] "Pusher" [...] or [...] "Non-Pusher".

Pusher seals will employ a dynamic secondary seal (typically an o-ring) which moves axially with the primary seal face. Non-pusher seals will employ a static secondary seal (either an O-ring, high temperature graphite packing, elastomeric bellows or <b>metal</b> <b>bellows).</b> In this case, the face tracking is independent of the secondary seal which is always static against the shaft/sleeve.|$|E
50|$|Welded bellows (also called edge-welded, or {{diaphragm}} bellows) {{are manufactured}} by welding {{a number of}} individually formed diaphragms to each other. The comparison between the two bellows types generally centers on cost and performance. Hydroformed bellows generally have a high tooling cost, but, when mass-produced, may have a lower piece price. However, hydroformed bellows have lower performance characteristics due to relatively thick walls and high stiffness. Welded <b>metal</b> <b>bellows</b> are produced with a lower initial tooling cost and maintain higher performance characteristics.

The multi-ply structure consists of a pressure-tight, longitudinally welded outer and inner cylinder of stainless steel. In between these cylinders is an open, spiral cylinder which forms multiple plies depending on the design. The multi-walled structure consists of several concentric, longitudinally welded cylinders. Each cylinder forms a pressure-tight and closed [...] "wall".|$|E
