5|$|Many {{over-the-counter}} and prescription-only medications contain paracetamol.

Paracetamol toxicity {{is one of the}} most common causes of poisoning worldwide. In the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, paracetamol is the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> drug overdoses.

5|$|Worldwide, {{too little}} iodine {{in the diet}} is the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> hypothyroidism.

Less common causes include: previous treatment with radioactive iodine, injury to the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary gland, certain medications, a lack of a functioning thyroid at birth, or previous thyroid surgery. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism, when suspected, can be confirmed with blood tests measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine levels.|$|E

5|$|In {{secondary}} adrenal insufficiency, a dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis {{leads to}} decreased {{stimulation of the}} adrenal cortex. Apart from suppression of the axis by glucocorticoid therapy, the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> secondary adrenal insufficiency are tumors that affect the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary gland. This type of adrenal insufficiency usually {{does not affect the}} production of mineralocorticoids, which are under regulation of the renin-angiotensin system instead.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, an {{increasing}} number of products used for everyday life proved to be poisonous.

5|$|Iodine {{deficiency}} is the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> primary hypothyroidism and endemic goiter worldwide. In {{areas of}} the world with sufficient dietary iodine, hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis). Hashimoto's may be associated with a goiter. It is characterized by infiltration of the thyroid gland with T lymphocytes and autoantibodies against specific thyroid antigens such as thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin and the TSH receptor.|$|E
5|$|Paracetamol {{poisoning}} {{was first}} {{described in the}} 1960s. Rates of poisoning vary significantly between regions of the world. In the United States more than 100,000 cases occur a year.

5|$|An {{underactive thyroid}} gland results in hypothyroidism. Typical {{symptoms}} are abnormal weight gain, tiredness, constipation, heavy menstrual bleeding, hair loss, cold intolerance, and a slow heart rate. Iodine deficiency is the <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> hypothyroidism worldwide, and the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis {{is the most}} common cause in the developed world. Other causes include congenital abnormalities, diseases causing transient inflammation, surgical removal or radioablation of the thyroid, the drugs amiodarone and lithium, amyloidosis, and sarcoidosis. Some forms of hypothyroidism can result in myxedema and severe cases can result in myxedema coma.|$|E
5|$|Biological, clinical, and {{demographic}} {{factors contribute to}} the likelihood that an injury will be fatal. In addition, outcome depends heavily on the cause of head injury.

The <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> endogenous Cushing's {{syndrome is}} a pituitary adenoma which causes an excessive production of ACTH. The disease produces a wide variety of signs and symptoms which include obesity, diabetes, increased blood pressure, excessive body hair (hirsutism), osteoporosis, depression and, most distinctively, stretch marks in the skin, caused by its progressive thinning.|$|E

5|$|Rotaviral {{enteritis}} is a mild {{to severe}} disease characterised by nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhoea and low-grade fever.
