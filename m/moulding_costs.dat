To manufacture panels with filigree geometries while using lower pin arrangement densities, attaching rapid tooling moulds is useful.

5|$|Since moulds {{have been}} {{expensive}} to manufacture, they were usually only used in mass production {{where thousands of}} parts were being produced. Typical moulds are constructed from hardened steel, pre-hardened steel, aluminium, and/or beryllium-copper alloy. The choice of material to build a mould from is primarily one of economics; in general, steel <b>moulds</b> <b>cost</b> more to construct, but their longer lifespan will offset the higher initial cost over a higher number of parts made before wearing out. Pre-hardened steel moulds are less wear-resistant and are used for lower volume requirements or larger components; their typical steel hardness is 38–45 on the Rockwell-C scale. Hardened steel moulds are heat treated after machining; these are by far superior in terms of wear resistance and lifespan. Typical hardness ranges between 50 and 60 Rockwell-C (HRC). Aluminium <b>moulds</b> can <b>cost</b> substantially less, and when designed and machined with modern computerised equipment can be economical for moulding tens or even {{hundreds of thousands of}} parts. Beryllium copper is used in areas of the mould that require fast heat removal or areas that see the most shear heat generated. The moulds can be manufactured either by CNC machining or by using electrical discharge machining processes.|$|R
40|$|AbstractLaminating carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) {{traditionally}} uses rigid moulds. This {{process means}} that customising CFRP components is expensive since {{the costs of}} each rigid mould are allocated fully to only one associated CFRP. Therefore, using form-flexible moulds is beneficial, because it would eliminate the conventional restriction that each CFRP geometry needs one single rigid <b>mould.</b> The <b>costs</b> of one flexible mould would be allocated to all produced CFRP components. Thus, the more CFRP laminated on this single form-flexible mould, the less the CFRP is affected by <b>mould</b> <b>costs.</b> Creating form-flexible <b>moulds</b> by using pin-type tooling results in a discrete pin accumulation. To achieve the required continuous laminating surface, an interpolation layer {{is placed on the}} pins. However, compared to conventional CFRP moulds, normally made by CNC-milling, pin-type tooling complicates accuracy achievement. This {{is due to the fact}} that the elastic, silicone-like interpolation layer as well as several tolerances or inaccuracies within the mould mechanics, as an assembly, accumulate into the range of millimeters. Instead of using more accurate pin-type moulds, which is associated with increasing costs, this paper introduces an approach to integrate 3 D surface detection methods into the process of form-flexible moulding of spatially curved CFRP using pin-type tools, which maintains costs and increases accuracy. The developed control loop compensates deviations dynamically and results in accuracies in the same range as parts produced using CNC-milled rigid moulds...|$|R

40|$|Recently {{the use of}} {{injection}} moulded bonded magnets has become very widespread. This is mainly due to their good value and low cost. There are several bonded-magnet compounds commercially available, even with rare hearth alloys that yield magnetic performances comparable to those ones offered by sintered magnets. However the magnetic properties of {{injection moulded}} bonded magnets are negatively affected by the thick solidification layer which develops during the filling of a mould cavity.

This paper presents an approach to improve the magnetic performance by applying a fast mould heating and cooling system and by varying some influent process parameters. A fast mould heating and cooling system based on cartridge heaters has been implemented in a CFD code, in order to simulate the mould thermal behavior.

Mould steel influences the cost of plastic parts more through its machinability, since machining cost exceeds {{more than half of}} the <b>cost</b> of a <b>mould.</b> Milling and drilling are the machining operations that are mostly used in production of a mould and the highest volume of material removal performs through these two categories of operations and specially milling.

Additionally, to avoid distortion and dimensional inaccuracy, the mould steels are supplied in prehardened condition which impairs their machinability. In this work, machinability of some of the most popular grades of prehardened plastic mould steels is compared in two milling and two drilling operations.

Manufacturing of tools and moulds influences the entire production {{of a large number}} of components, subassemblies and assemblies in many sectors, like motor vehicles, electronics, appliances, packaging. Short lead times, continuous changes in quantity and quality of orders and absence of correct work methods may cause fluctuations up to 40 percent between the pre and post calculation cost (and consequently variation of price). In the lapse of time between customer offer and <b>mould</b> production <b>costs</b> could vary up to 30 %; thus time dynamic costs, such as material cost and labor cost must be expected to reach a correct estimation of final price. A possible solution of the problem of miscalculation depending on disregarding time-dynamic costs is the integration of stock-market related pricing methods in the tool and mould manufacturing industry. Based on the described problems, the focus of this thesis is to establish a method to integrate time-dynamics costs, such as material costs or external labor, in the price estimation of the tool and mould manufacturing industries, to reduce price fluctuations.

Cost reduction is demonstrated using vacuum consolidation, special moulds and several welding techniques. The first example is a rudder from the vertical tail plane of a military aircraft. Several manufacturing steps including forming or shaping with flat plates, positioning stringers during vacuum consolidation, welding of ribs and welding of the central spar are shown. A cost statement is given analysing the overall manufacturing process. The second example shows the design study of a hybrid fan blade of an aero engine, made from titanium and CFRP part joined along an extended surface.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the most important}} production constraints and associated yield losses for six major food crops in 13 farming systems with high poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and East Asia, surveys were conducted with 672 experts representing a diversity of backgrounds and experience. Respondents reported large gaps between highest achieved crop yield on smallholder farms and average yield on farm. Yield gaps were smallest for rice (about 60 % of current average smallholder farm grain yields), mid size for wheat and cassava, and larger (sometimes double current farm yields) for sorghum, cowpea and chickpea. Gaps were also smaller in the high input and yield farming systems of East Asia and largest in the marginal, drier systems, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Four categories of production constraint (abiotic, biotic, management and socio-economic) were considered important contributors to yield gaps. A diversity of specific constraints was reported for the crops in the different systems. The most severe and widespread specific constraints for wheat involved the deficiency, high cost and poor management of N fertilizer, and problems associated with drought stress at grain filling, mid season drought and irrigation management. Those for rice included N fertilizer problems, soil fertility depletion, various leaf, stem and head pests and diseases, weed competition and inadequate water management. Striga and weed competition, soil resource degradation, poor soil fertility management, and drought were the most severe specific constraints for sorghum. Insect pests of pod, leaf, stem and flower and {{the high cost of}} their control dominated the constraint set for cowpea.

These limitations can now be overcome by a new manufacturing technology—Additive Manufacturing (AM), which provides the users much more freedom to design and produce structures in one piece. Additive manufacturing refers {{to a range of}} processing technologies, which fabricate 3 D parts by adding successive layers. With this technology, complex 3 D structures can be produced directly following the production of a geometric data. Additive manufacturing also enables production without the need of tooling, which brings the prospect of a revolution in the manufacturing industry. Material jetting is one of the additive manufacturing techniques, which generates material layers through inkjet printing. This technology also allows the user to build structures consisting of more than one material, which further expands the capability of additive manufacturing to include the production of multi-functional products. However, due to the strict requirements on the rheology of usable inks, there is a limited number of materials available for use in this technology. This research aims to develop a novel polycaprolactone based ink which is suitable for material jetting and could be potentially used for fabricating scaffolds. The bespoke nature of these devices often require a complex structures, customized design and small batch sizes, which all together make the product costly when using the traditional {{manufacturing methods}}. Additive manufacturing technology can reduce these costs, in the main due to the nil marginal cost (e. g. tooling <b>cost,</b> <b>mould</b> design etc.) when changing product design.
