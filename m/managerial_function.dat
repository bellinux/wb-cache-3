40|$|One of {{the renowned}} agendas’ of the {{management}} study around the globe encircles the gender biasness or non-biasness in performing the basic <b>managerial</b> <b>functions.</b> Pertaining to the factual studies, mixed views {{have been brought to}} light that whether male supervisors have a good relationship with male subordinates or female subordinates and whether female supervisors have good relationship with female subordinates or male subordinates. It is often assumed that cross gender supervisor subordinate relationships are better than same gender supervisor subordinate relationships. The involvement of subordinates in the four <b>managerial</b> <b>functions</b> namely planning, organizing, controlling and motivating are investigated to conclude the effects of gender on subordinate involvement in management functions by the supervisors. A sample of 1000 respondents were specifically chosen from banking sector to identify if gender of supervisor and subordinate has any effect on subordinates’ involvement across <b>managerial</b> <b>functions.</b> To achieve this, firstly, mean of male supervisor with same and cross gender subordinates is compared {{on the basis of their}} involvement in <b>managerial</b> <b>functions</b> through applying the split analysis. Results revealed that male supervisors involve male subordinates more in <b>managerial</b> <b>functions</b> than female subordinates. As for female supervisors they have the same level of involvement of both the genders across <b>managerial</b> <b>functions</b> but somehow these involvements are more towards the male subordinates. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Exploring <b>managerial</b> <b>functions</b> {{and related}} {{activities}} of inexperienced projectmanagers in the front-end of the innovation process (FEI). Design/methodology/approach: Fifteen student project managers were interviewed {{while they were}} engaged in the front-end phase of their respective 8 -month projects. 757 interview transcript segments on their perceptions of <b>managerial</b> <b>functions</b> were categorized based on thematic similarity of content. Findings: Four major <b>managerial</b> <b>functions</b> emerged: providing structural support, coordinating and acting as a link, empowering the team, and encouraging and providing social support. Out of these, traditional task-oriented <b>managerial</b> <b>functions</b> were emphasized. Research limitations/implications: Although limited by {{the small amount of}} participants in a university setting, the results suggest that task-oriented <b>managerial</b> <b>functions</b> are dominant even in the FEI for inexperienced project managers. More research is needed to understand the antecedents and consequences of such task- dominance, and whether it persists as more experience is accrued. On the other hand, domain knowledge seemed to play a smaller role than indicated by previous research. Practical implications: Project managers should pay attention to creating structure in the uncertain front-end phase. Swift familiarization with the capabilities and practices of each team member cannot be overemphasized, as otherwise the heterogeneity of the team might become a limitation rather than asset. On the other hand, domain experience of the manager may not be necessary in the FEI. Originality/value: The study addresses the gap in previous research on <b>managerial</b> <b>functions</b> specifically in the FEI. Task-oriented <b>managerial</b> <b>functions</b> emerged as way of novice project managers attempting to deal with the fluctuating contingencies in order to foster innovation. Peer reviewe...|$|R

A clear line demarcated the elite, but according to Burton, the line between poor and yeoman was never very distinct. Stephanie McCurry argues that yeomen were clearly distinguished from poor whites by their ownership of land (real property). Edgefield's yeomen farmers were [...] "self-working farmers," [...] distinct from the elite because they worked their land themselves alongside any slaves they owned. By owning large numbers of slaves, planters took on a <b>managerial</b> <b>function</b> and did not work in the fields.|$|E

In order to successfully dismiss a worker, the manager must provide sufficient evidence that his decision to fire was fair to all parties. This is judged in a court of law.====Johnstone v Bloomsbury: Health Authority==== Johnstone v Bloomsbury: Health Authority is an example of managerial prerogatives used in an abusive manner. Dr. Johnstone had been asked to work for a set time per week and also be ready when asked to work for additional hours. This was abused when his manager asked him to work inhumane hours, affecting Johnstone’s health and well-being. His manager was able to impose these hours on Dr. Johnstone but there are human rights in the UK that protect Johnstone and his health.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Compliance with {{surgical}} checklist use {{remains an}} obstacle {{in the context}} of checklist implementation programs. The theory of planned behaviour was applied to analyse attitudes, perceived behaviour control, and norms as psychological antecedents of individuals' intentions to use the checklist. METHODS A cross-sectional survey study with staff (N[*]=[*] 866) of 10 Swiss hospitals was conducted in German and French. Group mean differences between individuals with and without <b>managerial</b> <b>function</b> were computed. Structural equation modelling and confirmatory factor analysis was applied to investigate the structural relation between attitudes, perceived behaviour control, norms, and intentions. RESULTS Significant mean differences in favour of individuals with <b>managerial</b> <b>function</b> emerged for norms, perceived behavioural control, and intentions, but not for attitudes. Attitudes and perceived behavioural control had a significant direct effect on intentions whereas norms had not. CONCLUSIONS Individuals with <b>managerial</b> <b>function</b> exhibit stronger perceived behavioural control, stronger norms, and stronger intentions. This could be applied in facilitating checklist implementation. The structural model of the theory of planned behaviour remains stable across groups, indicating a valid model to describe antecedents of intentions {{in the context of}} surgical checklist implementation...|$|E
