40|$|Introduction <b>Multi-membered</b> {{evolution}} strategies, as {{introduced by}} Schwefel [1], {{are known to}} be robust optimum seeking procedures for a variety of parameter optimization problems. On account of their inherent parallelism <b>multi-membered</b> evolution strategies can be implemented easily on parallel computers. However, while there have been several studies on parallel versions of genetic algorithms [2][3], only little work has been done on parallel versions of evolution strategies. The approach taken here to parallelize the evolution strategy can be considered as a coarse grained one: A large population is divided into several subpopulations - each of them 'living' on a different transputer. After one or more generations some individuals migrate to a neighboring subpopulation, or in other words: the distributed optimization processes exchange information during the search.

40|$|Large scale {{offshore}} wind power has been recognized as a key technology to increase the share of renewable energy. However, as this energy source is currently still relatively expensive, efforts are made to significantly reduce its costs. Cost reductions are to be achieved, for instance, by installing larger turbines in larger {{offshore wind}} farms in order to benefit from economies of scale. Many of these large wind farms have to be built further offshore in deeper waters, where the waves are also higher. As a result traditional monopile foundations are not always feasible and <b>multi-membered</b> foundations, such as jackets and tripods, are required. The design of these foundations is generally done by a specialized company, which needs to take the loading from the wind turbine into account. In order to quantify this loading over the design lifetime, typically thousands of aero-elastic simulations are required. These aero-elastic models account for all the physical phenomena that are relevant for an offshore wind turbine, such as the structural-, aero-, hydro-, and controller dynamics. However, as models of <b>multi-membered</b> foundations are significantly larger than their monopile counterparts, more compact models are required to limit the computational costs of these simulations. Hence, advanced methods are required to enable the use of reduced models in wind turbine simulations. In addition, these techniques should also be used in an efficient and accurate design process involving multiple parties. In this thesis several computational approaches are proposed to fulfill these needs. It is shown that one is able to obtain accurate results, while speeding up calculations and that these methods fit perfectly into a multi-party design process.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{discusses}} {{the subject of}} automatic evolutionary sound matching: systems in which evolutionary algorithms are used to automatically derive the parameters of a synthesiser to produce a sound that matches a specified target sound. The paper describes prior work and identifies the principal causes of match inaccuracy, which are often due to optimiser limitations {{as a result of}} search space problem difficulty. The components of evolutionary matching systems contributing to problem difficulty are discussed and suggestions as to how improvements can be made through problem simplification or optimiser sophistication are considered. Subsequently, a novel clustering evolution strategy is presented which enables the concurrent optimisation of multiple distinct search space solutions, intended for the purposes of sound matching with standard frequency modulation (FM) synthesisers. The algorithm is shown to outperform standard <b>multi-membered</b> and multi-start (1 ? 1) evolution strategies in application to different FM synthesis models for static and dynamic sounds. The comparative study makes use of a contrived matching method, which ensures that results are not affected by the limitations of the matching synthesiser. ...|$|E
40|$|Many {{real-world}} {{scientific and}} engineering problems are constrained optimization problems (COPs). To solve those COPs, {{a variety of}} evolutionary algorithms have been proposed by incorporating various constraint handling techniques. However, {{many of them are}} not able to achieve the global optimum due to the presence of highly constrained, isolated feasible regions in the search space. To effectively address the low ratio of feasible regions in the search space, this paper presents a genetic programming based approximation approach in combination with a <b>multi-membered</b> evolution strategy. In the proposed constraint-handling method, we generate an approximate model for each constraint function with an increasing accuracy, from a linear-type approximation to a model that has a complexity similar to the original constraint functions, thereby manipulating the complexity of the feasible region. Thanks to this feature, our constrained evolutionary optimization algorithm can achieve the optimal solution, effectively. Simulations are carried out to compare the proposed algorithm with the state-of-the-art algorithms for handling COPs on 13 benchmark problems and three engineering optimization problems. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art on most test problems, and clearly outperforms many algorithms in solving the engineering design optimization problems. © 2011 ICIC INTERNATIONAL...|$|E
40|$|In {{engineering}} {{problems the}} randomness and uncertainties are inherent, thus the scatter of structural parameters from their nominal ideal values is unavoidable. Robust Design Optimization (RDO) methods primarily seek {{to minimize the}} influence of stochastic variations on the mean design, and traditionally rely on rough approximations of the stochastic response about the mean design. RDO yields a design with a state of robustness, so that its performance is the least sensitive to the variability of uncertain variables. The Monte Carlo Simulation method, that has been employed in the present work, has been proven to be very efficient for studying the stochastic response of large-scale structural systems {{with a large number}} of random variables. In this study, the task of robust design optimization of structures is formulated as a multi-criteria optimization problem, in which the design variables of the optimization problem, together with other design parameters, such as the modulus of elasticity and the yield stress, are considered as random variables having mean values equal to their nominal values. In the present study the aim is to minimize both structural weight and the variance of the structural response. The optimization algorithm employed is a two stage <b>multi-membered</b> Evolution Strategies scheme, specially tailored for solving multi-criteria structural optimization problems. 2.

In this paper, we describe an analysis of indel regions that accommodate length variations amongst related proteins. We have developed an algorithm CUSP, to examine <b>multi-membered</b> PASS 2 superfamily alignments to identify indel regions in an automated manner. Further, we have used the method to characterize the length, structural type and biochemical features of indels in related protein domains. Results CUSP, examines protein domain structural alignments to distinguish regions of conserved structure common to related proteins from structurally unconserved regions that vary in length and type of structure. On a non-redundant dataset of 353 domain superfamily alignments from PASS 2, we find that 'length- deviant' protein superfamilies show > 30 % length variation from their average domain length. 60 % of additional lengths that occur in indels are short-length structures (15 residues in length. Structural types in indels also show class-specific trends. Conclusion The extent of length variation varies across different superfamilies and indels show class-specific trends for preferred lengths and structural types. Such indels of different lengths even within a single protein domain superfamily could have structural and functional consequences that drive their selection, underlying their importance in similarity detection and computational modelling. The availability of systematic algorithms, like CUSP, should enable decision making in a domain superfamily-specific manner. </p...|$|E
40|$|Compliant {{mechanisms}} are joint-free monolithic substitutes for <b>multi-membered</b> rigid-body mechanisms. They offer numerous advantages in their manufacturing and performance. This thesis addresses the topology optimization of compliant mechanisms for flexibility, stiffness, and strength. Three new developments are reported. First, {{in order to}} take advantage of the computational efficiency of the optimality criteria method, an optimal property for compliant mechanisms is derived for a generalized multi-criteria flexibility-stiffness formulation. This property states that the ratio of the mutual strain energy density to the strain energy density is uniform through out the continuum excluding portions that are bounded by gage constraints. Using this property, robust topology design software, called PennSyn, is developed. With a graphical user interface, PennSyn enables fully automated design of compliant mechanisms from functional specifications to manufacturable form. Second, in order to obtain compliant and strong designs, local failure criteria are included in the topology optimization. Stress constraints are relaxed using quality functions that eliminate the problems associated with singularities. Solutions obtained with the flexibility-strength formulations are observed to be better than those obtained with flexibility-stiffness formulations. Third, geometric nonlinearity associated with large displacements is accounted for in the function evaluation and sensitivity analysis. Using the nonlinear topology optimization algorithm, prescribed nonlinear force-deflection characteristic and curved output path generation are demonstrated. Numerous examples are included to illustrate, analyze, and interpret the problem formulations and algorithms developed in this thesis, including the convexity issues. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOne {{increasingly}} popular type of foundations for offshore wind turbines {{in shallow water}} are truss structures. These are exposed to wave slamming forces from breaking wave events. These forces depend, among other parameters, on the slamming factor Cs that typically takes values between π - 2 π. So far, several studies about slamming forces have been done for monopile structures, but not much {{work has been done}} regarding truss structures such as offshore jackets. This paper is based on the WaveSlam project in which an instrumented <b>multi-membered</b> truss model has been subjected to regular and irregular waves in the large wave flume at FZK Hannover in 2013. The structure was built at scale 1 : 8 and equipped with force transducers along the bracings and columns that measured the structural response from the breaking waves. The goal {{of this study was to}} characterize the breaking wave forces acting on the front bracings of the structure, in order to estimate the respective slamming factors. The tested structure has been modelled and validated with a finite element model in ANSYS and a wave run test is analyzed. The wave loads have been defined as uniform loads with a triangular force time history acting along the bracings. Through a fitting procedure, the initial responses from ANSYS and from the data were matched with a relative error of 3 % for one single wave test. From this, a slamming factor of 4. 78 is found in the highest part of the front bracings. The characterization of more breaking wave loads is recommended in order to get an estimate of the largest slamming factor, which is relevant for design purposes...|$|E
