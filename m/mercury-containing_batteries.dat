When each battery reaches end of life it must be disposed of to prevent environmental damage. Batteries are one form of electronic waste (e-waste). E-waste recycling services recover toxic substances, which can then be used for new batteries. Of the nearly three billion batteries purchased annually in the United States, about 179,000 tons end up in landfills across the country. In the United States, the Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act of 1996 banned the sale of <b>mercury-containing</b> <b>batteries,</b> enacted uniform labeling requirements for rechargeable batteries and required that rechargeable batteries be easily removable. California and New York City prohibit the disposal of rechargeable batteries in solid waste, and along with Maine require recycling of cell phones. The rechargeable battery industry operates nationwide recycling programs in the United States and Canada, with dropoff points at local retailers.|$|E

In 1996 the United States Congress passed the Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act that prohibited further sale of <b>mercury-containing</b> <b>batteries</b> unless manufacturers provided a reclamation facility, effectively banning their sale.|$|E
50|$|The Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act of 1996 is {{a similar}} law in the United States, banning the sale of <b>mercury-containing</b> <b>batteries</b> (except small button cells), and {{requiring}} labeling for disposal and recycling.

50|$|In the United States, the <b>Mercury-Containing</b> and Rechargeable <b>Battery</b> Management Act (the Battery Act) (Public law 104-142) {{was signed}} into law on May 13, 1996. The purpose of the law was to phase out the use of mercury in {{batteries}} and to provide for the efficient and cost-effective collection and recycling, or proper disposal, of used nickel cadmium batteries, small sealed lead-acid batteries, and certain other batteries.|$|R
5|$|In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency {{is charged}} with {{regulating}} and managing mercury contamination. Several laws give the EPA this authority, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Safe Drinking Water Act. Additionally, the <b>Mercury-Containing</b> and Rechargeable <b>Battery</b> Management Act, passed in 1996, phases out the use of mercury in batteries, and provides for the efficient and cost-effective disposal of many types of used batteries. North America contributed approximately 11% of the total global anthropogenic mercury emissions in 1995.|$|R
