The detector pixel size was 200 x 300 mu m(2) and images were acquired by scanning the test object between the laminar detector and the x-ray source with a scanning step of 100 mu m. A molybdenum anode tube was used with two different filtrations: 2 mm aluminium and 25 mu m molybdenum. Conventional film-screen images were also obtained in order to compare spatial and contrast resolution. In our digital images {{it is possible to}} recognize low-contrast details having dimensions smaller than or equal to the dimensions of details visible by means of a clinical <b>mammographic</b> <b>unit.</b> The detection of microcalcifications smaller than 150 mu m was possible only when using the Mo filtration. However a copper wire of 50 mu m diameter was detectable when embedded in a simulated tissue. We discuss in detail the mean glandular doses (MGDs) delivered during the image acquisition. The MGDs necessary to obtain good-quality images are always smaller than at a conventional <b>mammographic</b> <b>unit.</b> Since MGDs depend on the x-ray spectrum, the dose reduction becomes larger when the applied spectrum is harder than in film-screen acquisition (Al filtration and 35 kVp) ...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{tested a}} new {{equipment}} containing a phantom to check quality mammographic image and an electronic instrument to measure incident radiation (Phan-EX). The phantom contains objects which have similar characteristics {{to the details}} of diagnostic interest and allows an easy and accurate estimation of image quality {{on the basis of the}} number of objects detected. The radiation detector, consisting of a solid state photodiode, provides an integer proportional to the input exposure. The results obtained highlighted a good reproducibility of instrument output and a good relationship between these values and the exposure ones obtained with a much more expensive ionization chamber. The device response was linear in varying both the anodic exposure (mAs) and the x-ray tube voltage (varying the energy, the calibration factor varied only by a small percent). The authors conclude that the Phan-EX may be useful for quality assurance of the <b>mammographic</b> <b>unit.</b> Furthermore, they suggest some of its practical applications: daily tests of qualitative of the <b>mammographic</b> <b>unit</b> and the treatment system performance, control of the automatic exposure probe, choice and optimization of exposure and treatment of the film parameters, the determination of the output of the x-ray tube, the evaluation of the sensitivity of different screen/film system...|$|E

Within roughly 5 min, the usual cranio-caudal and medio-lateral oblique views of both breasts are taken bilaterally, each of them composed by a low-energy and a high-energy image. The combination of the two images by a dedicated software allows for obtaining a new image where the presence of contrast uptake is easily recognised.|$|E

In Serbia, mammography is performed only clinically, {{although there is a}} plan to introduce mammography as a screening method. Currently, there are 60 <b>mammographic</b> <b>units</b> in practice, resulting in 70 000 mammographies annually. The survey was conducted in order to investigate mammographic practice in Serbia, identify weak points and suggest appropriate corrective measures. Basic technical parameters of the X-ray tube and generator, processing, image quality, and patient doses in 20 <b>mammographic</b> <b>units</b> were studied. The survey demonstrated considerable variations in technical parameters that affect image quality, and patients doses. Patient dose levels, in terms of the mean glandular dose, were fairly consistent with current European reference levels: 1. 8 (0. 40 - 4. 3) mGy. However, due to inappropriate image receptors, image processing and viewing conditions and automatic exposure control adjustment, suboptimal image quality was a common finding. Simple improvements of the radiographic technique and maintenance procedure, along with the rigid implementation of the quality control procedure and training of the operating staff, would improve the performance levels of mammographic practice in Serbia, i. e. result in the production of high quality images with a reasonably low radiation risk to patients...|$|R

40|$|International audienceImage quality {{assessment}} {{is required for}} an optimal use of <b>mammographic</b> <b>units.</b> On the one hand, there are objective image {{quality assessment}} methods based on the measure- ment of technical parameters such as modulation transfer function (MTF), noise power spectrum (NPS) or detection quantum efficiency (DQE) describing performances of dig- ital detectors. These parameters are, however, without direct relationship with lesion detectability in clinical practice. On the other hand, there are image quality assessment methods involving time consuming procedures, but presenting a direct relationship with lesion detectability. This contribution describes an X-ray source/digital detector model leading to the simulation of virtual contrast-detail phantom (CDMAM) images. The virtual image computation method requires the acquisition of only few real images and allows for an objective image quality assessment presenting a direct relationship with lesion detectability. The transfer function of the proposed model takes as input physical parameters (MTF* and noise) measured under clinical conditions on <b>mammographic</b> <b>units.</b> As presented in this contribution, MTF* is a modified MTF {{taking into account the}} effects due to X-ray scatter in the breast and magnification. Results obtained with the structural similarity index prove that the simulated images are quite realistic in terms of contrast and noise. Tests using contrast detail curves highlight the fact that the simulated and real images lead to very similar data quality in terms of lesion detectability. Finally, various statistical tests show that quality factors computed for both the simulated images and the real images are very close for the two data sets...|$|R

30|$|This is {{obtained}} {{with the same}} <b>mammographic</b> <b>unit</b> that acquires either the usual digital mammograms or tomosynthesis studies. The same cranio-caudal and medio-lateral oblique views are acquired for both examinations and the patient preparation and positioning are alike. The most important difference {{is the use of}} a moving x-ray source in tomosynthesis. During a tomosynthesis examination, the x-ray source moves following an arc over the breast and acquires several projections. At the end, numerous images per view are obtained, each of them showing a slice of the breast [19 – 21]. Tomosynthesis can be acquired as an additional imaging to the usual mammograms or it can be acquired alone. The latter protocol is possible because images very similar to the usual mammograms can be reconstructed from the tomosynthesis data set: these so-called synthetic mammograms can avoid the need for acquiring the original usual mammograms [20, 22]. According to the device used, radiation exposure is equal to slightly higher, as compared to mammography, but it is still within the limits recommended by international radiation safety guidelines [23]. Results of different studies comparing mammography alone with mammography with tomosynthesis demonstrated that tomosynthesis is able to significantly increase cancer detection up to 30 – 40  % [21].|$|E

The SYRMEP beam is an ideal tool for tomography due to the laminar and monochromatic beam with negligible divergence.

30|$|As with contrast-enhanced MRI, {{the basis}} of contrast-enhanced {{mammography}} is the fact that, during the development and growth of a tumour, it develops its own new blood vessels, {{which can be a}} bit leaky, allowing an intravenously injected contrast agent to enrich the tumour.

To be able to show this tumour contrast uptake in a mammographic image, you have to acquire two exposures of the breast within the time of one compression, each of them with a different x-ray energy composition, a technical possibility available for some new <b>mammographic</b> <b>units.</b> This results in a low-energy image, identical with a normal mammogram, and a high-energy image containing information about contrast agent distribution in the breast; the use of different energies is the reason for the denomination spectral mammography.

Material and methods: The imaging was undertaken using a Hologic Selenia full field digital <b>mammographic</b> <b>unit.</b> The proposed method utilises an ATOM phantom containing thermoluminescent dosimeters and a perspex-polyethylene breast phantom to measure organ doses during a standard four view screening mammogram. Effective dose was calculated and effective risk was modelled {{for a range of}} client ages. The total lifetime effective risk was then calculated for the UK national screening programme. Calculation of effective risk includes the radiation dose to examined and contralateral breasts in addition to other body organs; this is an advantage over the mean glandular dose. Results: The contralateral breast, thyroid, thymus, brain, lung, salivary glands, and bone marrow all receive more than 1 mGy radiation dose during screening mammography. A major difference exists for total effective lifetime risk of radiation-induced cancer between clients with average and high breast cancer risk. Differences are attributed to the commencement age of screening and time interval between screens.

40|$|In routine applications, {{information}} about the photon flux of x-ray tubes is obtained from exposure measurements and cataloged spectra. This approach relies mainly {{on the assumption that}} the real spectrum is correctly approximated by the cataloged one, once the main characteristics of the tube such as voltage, target material, anode angle, and filters are taken account of.

The simulated ESD are about 5 %- 10 % higher than the measured ESD values. The deviation between the measured and simulated MGD values in the phantom is of about 15 %.

40|$|Purpose: To {{measure the}} {{distribution}} of scattered radiation in a mammography unit for shielding design purposes. Methods and Materials: Measurements were carried out with an anthropomorphic phantom used to simulate a body from one adult patient. The dose rate for scattered radiation was recorded by placing a solid state sensor (Unfors Xi Survey Detector) every 10 degrees at 1 m distance from the FOV centre, in the axial and coronal planes of the breast. The scattered radiation distribution was treated as isodose curves, specifying the amount of radiation that will be delivered to a specific point in the room around the equipment (GE Senographe DMR). More than 50 exposures were made with a tube voltage of 30 kVp, anode-filter combination Mo/Mo and large focus. Results: In the axial plane, {{results show that the}} scattered radiation is absorbed up to 73 % {{on the back of the}} anthropomorphic phantom, at the potter bucky plane height. In the coronal plane, the scattered radiation significantly increases with the angle due to backscattering effect.

This paper presents a 3 -D reconstruction method for such clusters using two 2 -D views acquired during standard mammographic examinations. For this purpose, the <b>mammographic</b> <b>unit</b> was modeled using a camera with virtual optics. This model was used to calibrate the acquisition unit and then to reconstruct the clusters in the 3 -D space after microcalcification segmentation and matching.

Three-dimensional reconstruction results are presented here to prove the validity of the method. Tests were first performed using a phantom with a well-known geometry. The latter contained X-ray opaque glass balls representing microcalcifications. The positions of these balls were reconstructed with a 16. 25 -μm mean accuracy. This very high inherent algorithm accuracy is more than enough for a precise 3 -D cluster representation. Further validation tests were carried out using a second phantom including a spherical cluster. This phantom was built with materials simulating the behavior of both mammary tissue and microcalcifications toward Xrays. The reconstructed shape was effectively spherical.

The obtained results for the presampled PSF 0 show that the single Gaussian approximation is not appropriate, and the sum of two Gaussian approximations providing the best fit predicts the existence of a large (~ 50 %) narrow component. Another proof of this fact is the latest simulation study of columnar indirect digital detectors by A. Badano et al. The sampled two-dimensional PSF is determined using Monte Carlo simulation for the L-shape uniform distributed acceptance function for different values of fill factors. The detector spatial resolution is estimated using sampled PSF and has values 54 and 58 mkm for two different units. The calculation of the presampled modulation transfer function based on the PSF 0 estimation shows that the existing data can only be reproduced using a single Gaussian approximation and the usage of the sum of two Gaussian show significantly larger values in the higher frequency region for both units.

40|$|This article {{reports the}} results of {{mammography}} screening among socioeconomically disadvantaged women in Bronx, NY using a federally funded low-cost or no-cost cancer screening service. The New York State Department of Health provided funds for the uninsured through the Bronx Breast Health Partnership. All women < or = 40 years underwent screening mammography using both a mobile van <b>unit</b> and hospital-based <b>mammographic</b> x-ray <b>unit,</b> both American College of Radiology (ACR) accredited. Return visits were coordinated by a follow-up clinic at Montefiore Medical Center using a patient navigator who acted as an advocate for patients with abnormal screening findings. The overall detection rate of 12. 9 per 1000 women screened {{was significantly higher than}} the New York State detection rate of 6 per 1000 and 5. 1 per 1000 nationally. Availability of a patient navigator was an essential factor in the effectiveness of the work-up of problem cases. Low-cost or no-cost breast cancer screening programs can improve the availability, accessibility, acceptability, and utilization of mammography among underserved and uninsured women who are least likely to be screened otherwise...|$|R
40|$|To compare pain, {{projected}} breast area, {{radiation dose}} and image quality between flexible (FP) and rigid (RP) breast compression paddles. The {{study was conducted}} in a Dutch <b>mammographic</b> screening <b>unit</b> (288 women). To compare both paddles one additional image with RP was made, consisting of either a mediolateral-oblique (MLO) or craniocaudal-view (CC). Pain experience was scored using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Projected breast area was estimated using computer software. Radiation dose was estimated using the model by Dance. Image quality was reviewed by three radiologists and three radiographers. There was no difference in pain experience between both paddles (mean difference NRS: 0. 08 [*]±[*] 0. 08, p[*]=[*] 0. 32). Mean radiation dose was 4. 5 % lower with FP (0. 09 [*]±[*] 0. 01 p[*]=[*] 0. 00). On MLO-images, the projected breast area was 0. 79 % larger with FP. Paired evaluation of image quality indicated that FP removed fibroglandular tissue from the image area and reduced contrast in the clinically relevant retroglandular area at chest wall side. Although FP performed slightly better in the projected breast area, it moved breast tissue from the image area at chest wall side. RP showed better contrast, especially in the retroglandular area. We therefore recommend the use of RP for standard MLO and CC view...|$|R

40|$|A {{detectable}} {{difference in}} x-ray diffraction data of healthy and diseased breast tissues {{has been observed}} This information {{can be used to}} generate images with a higher contrast than that of conventional transmission mammography. A diffraction enhanced breast imaging (DEBI) system that simultaneously combines transmission and diffraction breast images is currently being developed. This paper presents the imaging system requirements for a clinical DEBI system. The DEBI imaging system employs a phosphor coated L 3 Vision CCD camera. The DEBI principle has been assessed at the SYRMEP synchrotron beamline (Elettra, Trieste) and with a purpose built <b>mammographic</b> x-ray imaging <b>unit</b> Diffraction enhanced images have been obtained of realistic breast tissue phantoms, consisting of 4 cm thick slabs of excised breast tissue containing embedded carcinomas. The images were obtained at pre-determined momentum transfer values, allowing some tissue characterization to be achieved during imaging, as well as optimizing image contrast. This paper presents {{the current state of the}} project The spatial resolution of the diffraction images have been studied using test phantoms and suggestions are made for the collimation systems necessary for a clinical system. A correction procedure applied to the diffraction images is also presented...|$|R
40|$|PurposeModel {{observers}} (MOs) are {{of interest}} in the field of medical imaging to assess image quality. However, before procedures using MOs can be proposed in quality control guidelines for mammography systems, we need to know whether MOs are sensitive to changes in image quality and correlations in background structure. Therefore, as a proof of principle, in this study human and model observer (MO) performance are compared for the detection of calcification-like objects using different background structures and image quality levels of unprocessed mammography images. MethodThree different phantoms, homogeneous polymethyl methacrylate, BR 3 D slabs with swirled patterns (CIRS, Norfolk, VA, USA), and a prototype anthropomorphic breast phantom (Institute of Medical Physics and Radiation Protection, Technische Hochschule Mittelhessen, Germany) were imaged on an Amulet Innovality (FujiFilm, Tokyo, Japan) <b>mammographic</b> X-ray <b>unit.</b> Because the complexities of the structures of these three phantoms were different and not optimized to match the characteristics of real mammographic images, image processing was not applied in this study. In addition, real mammograms were acquired on the same system. Regions of interest (ROIs) were extracted from each image. In half of the ROIs, a 0. 25 -mm diameter disk was inserted at four different contrast levels to represent a calcification-like object. Each ROI was then modified, so four image qualities relevant for mammography were simulated. The signal-present and signal-absent ROIs were evaluated by a non-pre-whitening model observer with eye filter (NPWE) and a channelized Hotelling observer (CHO) using dense difference of Gaussian channels. The ROIs were also evaluated by human observers in a two alternative forced choice experiment. Detectability results for the human and model observer experiments were correlated using a mixed-effect regression model. Threshold disk contrasts for human and predicted human observer performance based on the NPWE MO and CHO were estimated. ResultsGlobal trends in threshold contrast were similar for the different background structures, but absolute contrast threshold levels differed. Contrast thresholds tended to be lower in ROIs from simple phantoms compared with ROIs from real mammographic images. The correlation between human and model observer performance was not affected by the range of image quality levels studied. ConclusionsThe correlation between human and model observer performance does not depend on image quality. This is a promising outcome for the use of model observers in image quality analysis and allows for subsequent research toward the development of MO-based quality control procedures and guideline...|$|R
