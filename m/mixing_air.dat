500|$|The album's title [...] {{is a word}} {{coined by}} Yamaguchi. It {{is related to the}} term , a term {{describing}} the brackish water around river heads, where fresh water and salt water mix together. Yamaguchi replaced the character referring to water with the character referring to sky, applying the concept to <b>mixing</b> <b>air</b> instead. This phrase is used to represent the album's theme: mixing the unmixable. This idea related to how each member had completely different music tastes, but somehow were able to create music together. Similarly, it related to the idea of how Sakanaction as a band mixed rock, club and folk music, but were able to blend different tastes to find an equilibrium that a wide range of people would like. The band created the song [...] "Me ga Aku Aiiro" [...] as a song that would represent the album's theme in a single song. The album's introduction, a mix of recordings taken by Yamaguchi on his iPhone at the recording studio, was similarly created to match this theme.|$|E

One {{of them is the}} selective inverted sink prevents frost by drawing cold air from the ground and blowing it up through a chimney. It was originally developed to prevent frost damage to citrus fruits in Uruguay. In New Zealand, helicopters are used in a similar function, especially in the vineyard regions like Marlborough. By dragging down warmer air from the inversion layers, and preventing the ponding of colder air on the ground, the low-flying helicopters prevent damage to the fruit buds. As the operations are conducted at night, and have in the past involved up to 130 aircraft per night in one region, safety rules are strict.

50|$|Fog nozzles play an {{important}} part in firefighting tactics due to their versatility. The wide variety of fog nozzle manufacturers allows them to accommodate different sizes of fire hose- most often attack hand line- and streams and are capable in both fire protection and attack. With regard to flow rate, it is imperative to be sure that each fog nozzle be able to handle the flow rate of its water supply because the master stream devices to which they are sometimes attached can expel up to 2000 gal per minute. Nevertheless, as with almost all fog nozzles, those on master stream devices come with either automatic or manual spray pattern and stream adjustments. However, one significant disadvantage of fog nozzles is that Compressed Air Foam (CAF) bubbles' ratio of surface area to volume (which are formed by <b>mixing</b> <b>air</b> into a solution of water and foaming agents at the pump) exceeds that of fog nozzles' water droplets; therefore, the mechanical deflection in the nozzles themselves causes a loss of bubble structure, thereby reducing the CAF's ability to absorb heat. Despite this drawback, provided an appropriate nozzle pressure and water supply, fog nozzles are effective for any ground fire situation.|$|E

In this study, three colors of LEDs lights, red (620. 084 nm), white (464. 979 nm), and blue (458. 317 nm), respectively, are used to simulate light intensity in the space of cylindrical tank where photosynthetic bacteria is supposed to be cultured inside. The illuminations inside the tank are measured by an optical fiber which is connected to the AvaSpec- 2048 spectrometer. Average cosine corrector is installed on the fiber head. Photon fluxes are measured by LI-COR- 190 SA with LI- 1400 data logger. Based upon the experimental results for three different mediums, the illumination in the aqueous medium are the highest, followed by in the water <b>mixing</b> <b>air</b> bubbles medium, then in the air medium. If light sources of are altered, the illumination values from large to small are in the sequence of white, blue, red, respectively. Illumination experimental results show that the values in water <b>mixing</b> <b>air</b> bubbles medium are slightly lower than in the aqueous medium, but the difference is not significant. Therefore, for hydrogen production, using the water <b>mixing</b> <b>air</b> bubbles medium is proper because the bubble will not cause great illuminance decays and will increase the mixing effects in the cultivation container; it will be beneficial for the growth of algae and to improve the efficiency of hydrogen production purposes...|$|E
