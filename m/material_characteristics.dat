The boat will be built {{employing}} the techniques of the time – both to exploit the <b>material</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the timber and to develop an understanding of how large vessels were built in that period. Construction of a copy of the Nydam Boat will be based on the oak boat found in 1859. The construction of the Nydam Boat is divided into two phases. Phase 1 is feasibility study to investigate the construction of the boat. Here the builders will investigate prerequisites and gather experience for use in Phase 2, which comprises building the complete boat.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the capital}} outlay can be high, it is {{desirable}} to use a meter-mix or dispense unit for even low-volume production operations that require a steady output of finished parts. Dispense equipment consists of material holding (day) tanks, metering pumps, a mix head, and a control unit. Often, a conditioning or heater-chiller unit is added to control material temperature {{in order to improve}} mix efficiency, cure rate, and to reduce process variability. Choice of dispense equipment components depends on shot size, throughput, <b>material</b> <b>characteristics</b> such as viscosity and filler content, and process control. Material day tanks may be single to hundreds of gallons in size, and may be supplied directly from drums, IBCs (intermediate bulk containers, such as totes), or bulk storage tanks. They may incorporate level sensors, conditioning jackets, and mixers. Pumps can be sized to meter in single grams per second up to hundreds of pounds per minute. They can be rotary, gear, or piston pumps, or can be specially hardened lance pumps to meter liquids containing highly abrasive fillers such as chopped or hammer milled glass fibres and wollastonite.|$|E
