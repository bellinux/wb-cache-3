40|$|Osteopetrosis, {{also called}} as <b>marble</b> <b>bone</b> disease or the Albers Schonberg disease; is an {{extremely}} rare inherited disorder. The basic pathology is the defective resorption of bone by the osteoclasts. This results in an increased bone mass along with a decreased hematopoietic tissue, leading to normocytic normochromic anaemia. We recently encountered a case in a 4 month infant presenting with delayed milestones, pallor and mild hepatosplenomegaly. On hematological examination, the smear showed a leukoerythroblastic picture. The bone marrow biopsy and radiological features were instrumental in the diagnosis of this rare disease.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{occurrence}} of spondylolysis and/or spondylolisthesis of the lumbar vertebrae in five patients with osteopetrosis, four of them having multiple lesions. The case histories indicate that spondylolysis had developed in the pathological bone {{as a result of}} increased stress and that it is an acquired lesion. <b>Marble</b> <b>bone</b> disease was first described early in the 20 th century (Albers-Schonberg 1904; 1907) although it appears to have occurred even in prehistoric man (RegOly-M#{ 233 }rei 1962). About 200 to 300 cases ofthis rare condition have been reported (Johnston et al. 1968; Aegerter and Kirkpatrick 1975). The term osteopetrosis was first used by Karshner in 1926. Osteopetrosis is characterised by increased density and widening of the bones. Essentially, the lesion is one which involves the failure of resorption of calcified fetal chondroid and of primary bone, which prevents replace-ment by mature lamellar bone. Many authors have reported its clinical features and described its histopath-ology (Krompecher 1940; Cohen 195 1; Johnston et a!. 1968). Shapiro et al. in 1980 confirmed that the cause of the disease is impaired function ofosteoclasts. The exact molecular biology is not yet known. There is no effective treatment, and pathological fractures are an important complication. Their treat-ment may be difficult because of the abnormal bone structure and an increased susceptibility to bone infection. Although spondylolisthesis has been recognised for over 200 years (Andry 1741) and has an extensive literature we could find only two reports on the association of spondylolysis with osteopetrosis (Grep...|$|R

40|$|ClC- 7 is a ubiquitously {{expressed}} chloride {{channel that}} is mainly localized in late endosomes and lysosomes. Clcn 7 / mice show a severe osteopetrosis (<b>marble</b> <b>bone</b> disease) that becomes apparent shortly after birth (Kornak et al. 2001. Cell. 104 : 204 – 215). Although osteoclasts {{are present in}} normal numbers, they fail to resorb bone. In osteoclasts, ClC- 7 is highly expressed in the ruffled membrane that is formed by the fusion of H -ATPase containing late endosomal vesicles. We could show that chloride ions conducted by ClC- 7 provide the necessary countercharge to allow the H -ATPase to efficiently pump large amounts of protons into the resorption lacuna. The murine phenotype closely resembles human infantile malignant osteopetrosis. A screening for mutations in the human gene, CLCN 7, was performed in 18 patients suffering from this disease. Two patients were compound heterozygous for a nonsense mutation and two different missense mutations. Two of these mutations lead to a complete loss of the ClC- 7 protein in cultured patient fibroblasts corresponding {{to the loss of}} ClC- 7 in Clcn 7 / mice. Recently, mutations in CLCN 7 were found to cause also the much milder autosomal dominant form of osteopetrosis (ADOII) (Cleiren et al. 2001. Hum. Mol. Gen. 10 : 2861 – 2867). Investigation of primary osteoclasts from several ADOII patients revealed that ClC- 7 levels and subcellular localization are not detectably altered. Nevertheless, their resorptive activity is diminished. was increased in the channel open state. This implies that dominant mutations most likely perturb the electrophysiological function of ClC- 7 and that changes in the chloride conductance of the ruffled membrane are able to regulate bone resorption and bone density...|$|R

40|$|ClC- 7 is a ubiquitously {{expressed}} chloride channel whose {{function was}} unknown so far. Mice deficient for ClC- 7 were generated using two different gene targeting strategies. Whereas targeting construct C 7 A abolished expression of ClC- 7 completely, the LacZ gene was fused in frame into exon 7 of Clcn 7 {{as a reporter}} gene in construct C 7 B. Using the reporter gene to assess the expression pattern of ClC- 7, we detected strong signals in osteoclasts, dorsal root ganglia, trigeminal ganglion, retina, spinal cord and brain beside a ubiquitous basal expression level. These findings were corroborated by in situ hybridization. Clcn 7 -/- mice of both knockout-strains show the same severe osteopetrosis (<b>marble</b> <b>bone</b> disease) that becomes apparent shortly after birth, leading to an increased early postnatal lethality. Life expectancy of the surviving animals was reduced to maximal 45 days. Those mice were anemic and much smaller than wildtype mice. Additionally, there was progressive neurodegeneration in the retina and the brain. It could be excluded that this degeneration was secondary to osteopetrotic changes in Clcn 7 -/- mice. An accumulation of a lipofuscine-like material was detected in cerebral neurons, whereas no such material {{could be seen in}} the retina. Although osteoclasts are present in normal numbers, they fail to resorb bone because they cannot acidify the extracellular resorption lacuna. In osteoclasts, ClC- 7 is highly expressed in the ruffled membrane that is formed by the fusion of H + -ATPase containing vesicles and that secretes protons into the lacuna. In the proximal tubule of the kidney ClC- 7 probably resides in late endosomes and lysosomes. The murine phenotype closely resembles human infantile malignant osteopetrosis. Therefore, in 12 patients suffering from this disease a screening for mutations in the human gene, CLCN 7, was performed. One patient was compound heterozygous for a nonsense and a missense mutation. These mutations lead to a complete loss of the ClC- 7 protein from cultured fibroblasts of the patient. It is concluded that ClC- 7 provides the chloride conductance required for an efficient proton pumping by the H + -ATPase of the osteoclast ruffled membrane. The insufficient acidification in Clcn 7 -/- mice therefore prevents bone resorption. A similar acidification defect in lysosomal compartments may cause neuronal storage because of decreased degradati on. </body...|$|R

5000|$|The {{philosophical}} {{concept of}} li is inherently {{difficult to define}} and is easily mistranslated into various simplifications of the core idea.Many philosophers have tried to better explain it, Alan Watts {{being one of the}} prominent 20th century authors on the subject. The tao is a certain kind of order, and this kind of order is not quite what we call order when we arrange everything geometrically in boxes, or in rows. That is a very crude kind of order, {{but when you look at}} a plant it is perfectly obvious that the plant has order. We recognize at once that it is not a mess, but it is not symmetrical and it is not geometrical looking. The plant looks like a Chinese drawing, because they appreciated this kind of non-symmetrical order so much that it became an integral aspect of their painting. In the Chinese language this is called li, and the character for li means the markings in jade. It also means the grain in wood and the fiber in muscle. We could say, too, that clouds have li, marble has li, the human body has li. We all recognize it, and the artist copies it whether he is a landscape painter, a portrait painter, an abstract painter, or a non-objective painter. They all are trying to express the essence of li. The interesting thing is, that although we all know what it is, there is no way of defining it. Because tao is the course, we can also call li the watercourse, and the patterns of li are also the patterns of flowing water. We see those patterns of flow memorialized, as it were, as sculpture in the grain in wood, which is the flow of sap, in <b>marble,</b> in <b>bones,</b> in muscles. All these things are patterned according to the basic principles of flow. In the patterns of flowing water you will find all kind of motifs from Chinese art, immediately recognizable, including the S-curve in the circle of yang-yin.So li means then the order of flow, the wonderful dancing pattern of liquid, because Lao-tzu likens tao to water:The great tao flows everywhere, to the left and to the right, It loves and nourishes all things, but does not lord it over them.
