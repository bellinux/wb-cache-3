5|$|In 1907, Besant {{became the}} {{president}} of the Theosophical Society globally, and set to work with a major expansion of the organisation's headquarters at Adyar, in what was then, Madras. When it was announced that Besant would undertake a speaking tour of Australia in 1908, she was expected to stay with Fuller while in Perth. Some months later in 1908, Fuller left Western Australia and travelled to India, staying at Adyar. Of her time in India, Fuller wrote:I went in search not only of beauty, and light, and colour, and the picturesqueness in general, which delight the eye and emotions of all artists—but of something deeper—something less easily expressed. I spent {{two and a half years}} in a community that is quite unique—perhaps the most cosmopolitan settlement in the world—the headquarters of the Theosophical Society... Well, I painted there, of course, but <b>my</b> <b>art</b> was undergoing a change, and I felt that it could not satisfy me unless it became so much greater.|$|E
5|$|The {{sixth and}} final symphony, Sinfonia semplice, {{was written in}} 1924–25. After {{suffering}} a serious heart attack in 1925, Nielsen was forced to curtail much of his activity, although he continued to compose until his death. His sixtieth birthday in 1925 brought many congratulations, a decoration from the Swedish government, and a gala concert and reception in Copenhagen. The composer, however, was in a dour mood; {{in an article in}} Politiken on 9 November 1925 he wrote: If I could live my life again, I would chase any thoughts of Art out of my head and be apprenticed to a merchant or pursue some other useful trade the results of which could be visible in the end... What use is it to me that the whole world acknowledges me, but hurries away and leaves me alone with my wares until everything breaks down and I discover to my disgrace that I have lived as a foolish dreamer and believed that the more I worked and exerted myself in <b>my</b> <b>art,</b> the better position I would achieve. No, it is no enviable fate to be an artist.|$|E

25|$|I knew Germany was in {{a terrible}} crisis; I felt {{responsible}} for German music, {{and it was my}} task to survive this crisis, as much as I could. The concern that <b>my</b> <b>art</b> was misused for propaganda had to yield to the greater concern that German music be preserved, that music be given to the German people by its own musicians. These people, the compatriots of Bach and Beethoven, of Mozart and Schubert, still had to go on living under the control of a regime obsessed with total war. No one who did not live here himself in those days can possibly judge what it was like.|$|E

He would not be specific on their themes or message. [...] "I see my work as waves on the ocean", he told the latter. [...] "Some people look for shells in it, some surf, others—dive". He had always intended for them to be a series, regardless of whether they went viral or not. [...] "Currently, there is a call for more, and I aim to please", he admitted.

By 1841 Etty had around £300 invested, rising to £8500 in 1845 and £17,000 in 1849.

500|$|Due to {{his support}} for the LGBT community, and his {{portrayal}} of gay characters in his projects, Franco's sexuality has been a subject of discussion in [...] media sources, relentlessly questioning if he himself is gay. In response to questions regarding his sexuality, he insists he finds plenty more dimensions to the characters than their bedroom proclivities. [...] "Or, you know what," [...] he quipped, [...] "maybe I’m just gay". In a March 2015 interview with Four Two Nine magazine, Franco again opened up about his sexuality, commenting that it is not who you have sex with that defines your sexuality, but instead how you act. [...] "In the twenties and thirties, they used to define homosexuality by how you acted and not by whom you slept with. Sailors would fuck guys all the time, but as long as they behaved in masculine ways, they weren’t considered gay". Franco added, [...] "Well, I like to think that I’m gay in <b>my</b> <b>art</b> and straight in my life".|$|E

[...] He said, [...] "Everything I did was focused on making good music and being a great musician, not running a business. Yet it takes a businessperson to bring music to the masses." [...] But some artists just want to [...] be involved in the music and do not like the added problems or have the personality to work with both. [...] Joseph suggests newer artists read and study both courses and pick one that best suits their needs and wants. [...] He advises, [...] "...to keep your eyes and ears open all the time. [...] All the information you need is available to you to have a successful career in music, if you're paying attention, and not closed off to anything." [...] He explains, [...] "Time and persistence has shown me that I can succeed at sharing <b>my</b> <b>art</b> with others as a musician while running my own music business.

[...] Through 2003, he was active as inker on several Marvel Comics titles, including Daredevil (#248–300), Spider-Man 2099 (#1–25), and Spider-Girl (#1–61), and such non-superhero projects as the four-issue Marvel / Epic Comics miniseries Atomic Age (Nov. 1990 – Feb. 1991), by writer Frank Lovece and penciler Mike Okamoto, for which Williamson won a 1991 Eisner Award for Best Inker. Daredevil penciler John Romita Jr. recalled that, [...] "Working with Al Williamson was much like working with my father [...] in that I felt that I was protected from mistakes. ...
