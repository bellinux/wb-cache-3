Dihydromorphine can be acetylated into another 3,6 morphine diester, namely diacetyldihydromorphine (Paralaudin), and hydrocodone into thebacon.|$|E
500|$|The {{masked shrike}} was {{described}} by German explorer and naturalist Martin Lichtenstein in 1823 under its current scientific name. Lanius is the Latin for a butcher, and comes from the shrikes' habit of impaling prey, reminiscent of a butcher hanging carcasses, and nubicus means [...] "Nubian" [...] (from northeast Africa). The bird was independently described by Dutch zoologist Coenraad Temminck in 1824 as Lanius personatus, from the Latin personatus [...] "masked", referring, as does the English name, to the bird's appearance, but the older name takes precedence. A later synonym from 1844 was L. leucometopon from the Greek leukos, [...] "white", and <b>metopon,</b> [...] "forehead", describing {{a feature of the}} distinctive head pattern. [...] "Shrike", first recorded in 1545, derives from the shrill cries given by this family, and the traditional common name [...] "butcher-bird" [...] again refers to the characteristic prey storage, and has been in use since at least 1668.|$|E
50|$|<b>Metopon</b> is {{sometimes}} used in medicine, although longer acting than hydromorphone, <b>Metopon</b> is less potent and its oral bioavailability is fairly low. Generally, <b>Metopon</b> has few advantages to {{distinguish it from}} other, more commonly used opioid analgesics, although {{it does have a}} slightly lower tendency to produce nausea and respiratory depression compared to morphine.|$|E
5000|$|In Canada, as of 1948, the {{hydrochloride}} of <b>metopon</b> (free base {{conversion ratio}} 0.891, molecular weight 335.8) was available only for oral administration for malignant pain and for maintenance of those habituated to morphine; the only dosage form available was singly scored 8 mg tablets. It was manufactured by Parke, Davis, & Co., {{and was only}} for sale to doctors and hospitals. Parke, Davis & Co. did not sell <b>metopon</b> to pharmacies. [...] It is unknown whether <b>metopon</b> tablets are still manufactured and sold in Canada.|$|E

50|$|<b>Metopon</b> (5-methyldihydromorphone) is an opioid {{analogue}} {{that is a}} methylated {{derivative of}} hydromorphone which was invented in 1929 as an analgesic.|$|E
50|$|<b>Metopon</b> tablets, ampoules, and suppositories are {{available}} in Switzerland, Austria, Germany, and other countries in Continental Europe and the drug is used in Patient Controlled Analgesia pumps for severe chronic pain in particular. <b>Metopon</b> is listed under Schedule II of the US Controlled Substances Act 1970, meaning it has an accepted medical use, but at this time it is not produced commercially and is seen only in laboratory research. It did see some use in medicine — oncology in particular — in the USA in the 1950s. Currently <b>metopon,</b> which has a DEA ACSCN of 9260, {{does not have an}} annual manufacturing quota listed in the Federal Register and the bulk of the research on the drug at this time is taking place in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria.|$|E
50|$|N-Phenethyl-14-ethoxymetopon is a {{drug that}} is a {{derivative}} of <b>metopon.</b> It is a potent analgesic, around 60 times stronger than morphine and produces significantly less constipation.|$|E
5000|$|... 14-Ethoxymetopon is an opioid analog {{that is a}} {{derivative}} of <b>metopon</b> which has been substituted with an ethoxy group at the 14-position. It is a highly potent analgesic drug several hundred times more potent than morphine.|$|E
5000|$|Its Ancient Greek {{name was}} Κριού Μέτωπον (Kriou <b>Metopon)</b> meaning Ram's Brow. [...] The Slavic {{language}} variants of the mountain's name are translations from the Crimean Tatar name and mean Bear Mountain ("bear"-медведь in Russian, ведмідь in Ukrainian, ayuv in Crimean Tatar; [...] "mountain"-гора in Russian and Ukrainian, dağ in Crimean Tatar).|$|E
5000|$|... 14-Phenylpropoxymetopon (PPOM) is an opiate {{analogue}} that is {{a derivative}} of <b>metopon</b> which has been substituted with a γ-phenylpropoxy group at the 14-position. It is a highly potent analgesic drug several thousand times stronger than morphine, with a similar in vivo potency to etorphine. The 14-phenylpropoxy substitution appears to confer potent μ-opioid agonist activity, even when combined with substitutions such as N-cyclopropyl or N-allyl, which normally result in μ-opioid antagonist compounds.|$|E

50|$|Very small {{quantities}} of hydromorphone are detected in assays of opium on rare occasions; {{it appears to}} be produced by the plant under circumstances and by processes which are not understood at this time and may include the action of bacteria. A similar process or other metabolic processes in the plant may very well be responsible for the very low quantities of hydrocodone also found on rare occasions in opium and alkaloid mixtures derived from opium. Dihydrocodeine, oxymorphol, oxycodone, oxymorphone, <b>metopon,</b> and possibly other derivatives of morphine and hydromorphone also are found in trace amounts in opium.|$|E
50|$|Opiates {{belong to}} the large biosynthetic group of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, and are so named because they are {{naturally}} occurring alkaloids found in the opium poppy. The major psychoactive opiates are morphine, codeine, and thebaine. Papaverine, noscapine, and approximately 24 other alkaloids are also present in opium but have little to {{no effect on the}} human central nervous system, and as such are not considered to be opiates. Very small quantities of hydrocodone and hydromorphone are detected in assays of opium on rare occasions; it appears to be produced by the plant under circumstances and by processes which are not understood at this time and may include the action of bacteria. Dihydrocodeine, oxymorphol, oxycodone, oxymorphone, <b>metopon</b> and possibly other derivatives of morphine and/or hydromorphone also are found in trace amounts in opium.|$|E
5000|$|... 14-Methoxymetopon is an opiate {{analogue}} {{developed by}} {{a team led by}} Professor Helmut Schmidhammer at the University of Insbruck in the mid 1990s. It is a derivative of <b>metopon</b> in which a methoxy group has been inserted at the 14-position. It is a highly potent analgesic drug that is around 500x stronger than morphine when administered systemically; however, when given spinally or supraspinally, it exhibits analgesic activity up to a million fold greater than morphine. It binds strongly to the μ-opioid receptor and activates it {{to a greater extent than}} most similar opioid drugs. This produces an unusual pharmacological profile, and although 14-methoxymetopon acts as a potent μ-opioid full agonist in regard to some effects such as analgesia, a ceiling effect is seen on other effects such as constipation and respiratory depression which is believed to involve interaction with the κ-opioid receptor ...|$|E

40|$|Morphine {{depresses}} the twitch and tetanus of stimulated guinea-pig ileum {{by reducing}} acetylcholine released from cholinergic nerve endings. Acetylcholine output per shock falls to {{roughly the same}} residual amount at varying stimulation rates. Since normal output per shock declines with increasing stimulus frequency, the proportionate effect of morphine diminishes as stimulus frequency rises. Acute “tolerance” to morphine and a state of “morphinedependence” can be produced. Phenadoxone, dihydromorphinone, <b>metopon,</b> methadone, and heroin are more active, codeine and pethidine less active, than morphine. Nalorphine also depresses the twitch and can desensitize the gut both to itself and to morphine...|$|E
