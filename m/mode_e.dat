50|$|On 31 August 2009, DRM+ (<b>Mode</b> <b>E)</b> {{became an}} {{official}} broadcasting standard {{with the publication}} of the technical specification by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute; this is effectively a new release of the whole DRM spec with the additional mode permitting operation above 30 MHz up to 174 MHz.|$|E
50|$|Wider {{bandwidth}} {{channels are}} used, which allows radio stations to use higher bit rates, thus providing higher audio quality. A 100 kHz DRM+ channel has sufficient capacity to carry one low-definition 0.7 megabit/s wide mobile TV channel: {{it would be}} feasible to distribute mobile TV over DRM+ rather than DMB or DVB-H. However, DRM+ (DRM <b>Mode</b> <b>E)</b> as designed and standardized only provides bitrates between 37.2 and 186.3 kbit/s depending on robustness level, using 4-QAM or 16-QAM modulations and 100 kHz bandwidth.|$|E

30|$|All {{dispersion}} {{curves of}} the <b>E</b> <b>mode</b> are doubly degenerate because the irreducible {{representation of the}} <b>E</b> <b>mode</b> is two-dimensional. For the <b>E</b> <b>modes,</b> the lowest dispersion curve near k = 0 is proportional tok 2. This parabolic behavior {{is due to the}} fact that these modes correspond to the bending of the NWSL. Figure 2 e clearly shows that the <b>E</b> <b>modes</b> have a feature of flexural mode.|$|R
50|$|IEC 61107 or {{currently}} IEC 62056-21, was {{an international}} standard {{for a computer}} protocol to read utility meters. It is designed to operate over any media, including the Internet. A meter sends ASCII (in modes A..D) or HDLC (<b>mode</b> <b>E)</b> data to a nearby hand-held unit (HHU) using a serial port. The physical media are usually either modulated light, sent with an LED and received with a photodiode, or a pair of wires, usually modulated by a 20mA current loop. The protocol is usually half-duplex.|$|E
5000|$|The general {{protocol}} {{consists of}} a [...] "sign on" [...] sequence, in which a handheld unit identifies itself to the metering unit. During sign-on, the handheld unit addresses a particular meter by number. The meter and hand-held unit negotiate various parameters such as the maximum frame length during transmission and reception, whether multiple frames can be sent without acknowledging individual frames (windowing), the fastest communication rate that they can both manage (only in case of <b>mode</b> <b>E</b> switching to HDLC) etc.Next the meter informs the hand held unit about the various parameters that are available with it in various security settings viz. the 'no security logical group', ' the low security logical groups' and ' the high security logical groups'.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{coordination}} types {{have been}} observed for transition metal phosphinimide complexes including terminal, μ2-N-bridging, and μ3-N-bridging. In the terminal bonding mode the ligand can have either a linear or a bent geometry at nitrogen, and in the μ2-N-bridging mode, four-membered M2N2 rings can be formed either in an unsymmetrical fashion or in a symmetrical fashion. [...] The preferred coordination type is largely dependent upon the oxidation state of the metal as well as, to a lesser extent, upon the ligand sphere of the metal and the steric and electronic properties of the R groups on phosphorus. Bonding modes (A) and (B) are primarily seen in complexes containing metals in high oxidation states, <b>mode</b> (<b>E)</b> is preferred by metals with low oxidation states, and modes (C) and (D) are preferred by metals with medium oxidation states.|$|E

40|$|Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) {{refers to}} “communication {{that takes place}} between human beings via [networked] {{computers}} ” (Herring, 1996), which includes both synchronous <b>modes</b> (<b>e.</b> g., real-time chat and video-conferencing) and asynchronous <b>modes</b> (<b>e.</b> g., e-mails and bulletin boards). This new type of communication is now widely used in foreign language learning and teaching either {{in the form of}} telecollabration (class-to-class collaboration) or tandem learning (student-to-student collaboration). The studies on CMC-based language learning, on the whole, have been framed within the Interactionist theory; however, recently, prompted by the suggestion of the sociocognitive approach to the study of CMC (Kern & Warschauer, 2000; Chapelle, 2001), the frameworks used in researching CMC have been expanded to include Sociocultural theory. The sociocultural frameworks for CMC-based language learning, by and large, are based on the claims of scholars calling for sociocultural approaches to second language (L 2) and foreign language (FL...|$|R

40|$|On real {{processes}} many junctional {{states are}} usually observed. However {{some of them}} may represent different significant levels (or rates) of the same functional node. They do not represent by themselves a functional mode, they are only sub-modes of the same functional <b>mode</b> (<b>e.</b> g. one of the functional mode of my car is tank empty; some functional states observed may be 10 % empty tank, 50 % empty tank, 96 % empty tank). Thus the interest is not only to diagnose the functional <b>mode</b> (<b>e.</b> g. tank empty, sleeping driver) but also to highlight the gravity level of this functional <b>mode</b> (<b>e.</b> g. the reaction in the middle of desert, confronted to a 4 % empty tank {{is not the same as}} confronted to a 98 % empty tank). The aim of this paper is to present a diagnosis method based on fuzzy pattern recognition. Such a method allows the diagnosis of the current functional mode of a process and its gravity level. Usually in pattern recognition area, a membership function is a monotonic decreasing function of a Euclidean distance between two objects. Those objects represent two states of the process and a distance here is a dissimilarity measure between those states. Such a distance is defined in all the fuzzy subset associated with this membership function. So that function is monotonic decreasing in all subset directions. In this paper directional membership functions are proposed. In this case the distance is defined only by reference to a path describing the evolution from one functional state to another one. Then the obtained membership function is oriented according to this path and do not decrease identically within all directions in the subset. Such membership functions are then suitable in order to diagnose the state associated with data evoluting between known functional modes. An application to the French telephone network illustrates this method...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between telecommunications and travel {{has been a}} fertile area of research for several decades. Early speculation (e. g., Owen, 1962) focused on the potential of telecommunications to replace travel. That hope {{eventually led to the}} establishment of several telecommuting programs, and empirical evaluations of those programs (e. g., Hamer, et al., 1991; Mokhtarian, et al., 1995) seemed to support the substitution expectation. While empirical evidence for other telecommunications applications was far more scarce, it was similarly expected that teleconferencing, teleshopping, distance learning, and other such services would also replace travel. In the meantime, however, some scholars (e. g. Albertson, 1977; Salomon, 1985; Mokhtarian, 1990, 2003; Niles, 1994) began to point out that substitution was not the only possible impact of telecommunications on transportation. In particular, it was argued that a very likely impact would be the generation of more travel, or complementarity. In the short term, this effect could arise in two kinds of ways, which the literature (Salomon, 1986) labels enhancement and efficiency. * Enhancement refers to a direct impact of one mode of communications (e. g. telecommunications) on the demand for another <b>mode</b> (<b>e.</b> g. travel). For example, the increasing ease of electronically obtaining information about interesting locations, activities, and people could stimulate the demand for travel to visit those locations or people and engage in those activities (Gottman, 1983; Couclelis, 1999). * Efficiency refers to the use of one <b>mode</b> (<b>e.</b> g. telecommunications) to improve the operation of another <b>mode</b> (<b>e.</b> g. the transportation network). The effect on demand is indirect in this case, by increasing the effective supply of transportation and hence, by lowering its (generalized) cost, making travel more attractive and thus increasing the demand for it.

40|$|We perform {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} turbulent convection for infinite Prandtl number with free-slip walls, {{and study the}} dynamics of flow reversals. We show interesting correlations between the flow reversals and the nonlinear interactions among the large-scale flow structures represented by the modes (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1) and some others. After a flow reversal, the odd <b>modes,</b> <b>e.</b> g. (1, 1), (3, 1), switch sign, but the even <b>modes,</b> <b>e.</b> g. (2, 2), retain their sign. The mixed modes (1, 2) and (2, 1) fluctuate around zero. Using {{the properties of the}} modes and their interactions, we show that they form a Klein four-group Z_ 2 × Z_ 2. We also show that for the free-slip boundary condition, the corner rolls and vortex reconnection are absent during a flow reversal, in contrast to active role played by them in flow reversals for the no-slip boundary condition. We argue that the flow reversals with the no-slip and free-slip boundary conditions are different because they are induced by nonlinearities (u·∇) u and (u·∇) θ respectively.
