40|$|A {{methodology}} is developed, {{which combines}} a top-down design procedure for manufacturing systems with a decomposition of <b>manufacturing</b> system <b>requirements.</b> Traditional design procedures for manufacturing system design guide {{the design process}} from {{the analysis of the}} product to be produced through detailed design of the system to operational execution planning. While such design procedures provide the designer with a structured top-down approach, it does not enable the designer to recognize how design decisions at various stages affect the overall system requirements. The decomposition of <b>manufacturing</b> system <b>requirements</b> applies axiomatic design. It relates system objectives to design solutions and enables the connection of design decisions such as equipment selection and operator work loop design with higher-level system objectives such as improvement of quality, reduction of throughput time, and cost control. However, the decomposition does not provide the designer with a procedure for the physical system design. The paper elaborates how the traditional design procedure can be linked with the decomposition of <b>manufacturing</b> system <b>requirements.</b> The combination of the design procedure with the functional decomposition provides designers with a better tool to efficiently design manufacturing systems by considering <b>manufacturing</b> system <b>requirements</b> throughout the design process.

The present investigation centered on the feasibility of this technology for the widely used Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy. Impact process parameters were established and mechanical properties were investigated. In general, static properties were good. Fatigue strength reduced however, although much less so for notched specimens compared to un-notched material. Fatigue crack initiation could be linked to complex features within the (wavy) weld interface associated with the 'first generation' impact welding parameters. Next steps are foreseen to improve the fatigue performance.
