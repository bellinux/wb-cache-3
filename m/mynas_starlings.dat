50|$|The brahminy <b>myna</b> or brahminy <b>{{starling}}</b> (Sturnia pagodarum) is {{a member}} of the starling family of birds. It is usually seen in pairs or small flocks in open habitats on the plains of the Indian subcontinent.|$|R
25|$|Sydney is home {{to dozens}} of bird species, which {{commonly}} include the Australian raven, Australian magpie, crested pigeon, noisy miner and the pied currawong, among others. Introduced bird species ubiquitously found in Sydney are the common <b>myna,</b> common <b>starling,</b> house sparrow and the spotted dove. Reptile species are also numerous and predominantly include skinks. Sydney has a few mammal and spider species, such as the grey-headed flying fox and the Sydney funnel-web, respectively.|$|R
50|$|The grosbeak {{starling}} (Scissirostrum dubium), {{also known}} as the grosbeak myna, finch-billed <b>myna,</b> or scissor-billed <b>starling,</b> is a species of starling in the family Sturnidae. It is monotypic in the genus Scissirostrum. It is endemic to Sulawesi, Indonesia.|$|R
50|$|Common mynas roost communally {{throughout}} the year, either in pure or mixed flocks with jungle <b>mynas,</b> rosy <b>starlings,</b> house crows, jungle crows, cattle egrets and rose-ringed parakeets and other birds. The roost population {{can range from}} less than one hundred to thousands. The time of arrival of mynas at the roost starts before and ends just after sunset. The mynas depart before sunrise. The time and timespan of arrival and departure, time taken for final settlement at the roost, duration of communal sleep, flock size and population vary seasonally.|$|R
50|$|This myna {{is almost}} entirely arboreal, moving in large, noisy groups {{of half a dozen}} or so, in tree-tops {{at the edge of the}} forest. It hops {{sideways}} along the branch, unlike the characteristic jaunty walk of other <b>mynas.</b> Like most <b>starlings,</b> the hill <b>myna</b> is fairly omnivorous, eating fruit, nectar and insects.|$|R
50|$|The insectivorous, {{carnivorous}} {{and most}} of the omnivorous birds help control the insect and rodent pests in the forest {{as well as in the}} agricultural ecosystem adjoining the forest. Frugivores like the hornbills, barbets, pigeons and koel, along with some of the omnivores like crows, <b>mynas</b> and <b>starlings</b> that feed on fruits serve as seed dispersers. Nectarivores and some of the insectivores and omnivores that feed on nectar help in plant pollination. There are terrestrial piscivores like the kingfishers, brown fish owl and osprey and 31 aquatic species that depend on the rivers and streams inside the forest and the agricultural fields along the forest edge.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} species of {{starling}} in South Africa, {{two of which are}} introduced species: the common starling and the common <b>myna.</b> The common <b>starling</b> was introduced by Cecil John Rhodes in 1890 from Europe in Cape Town. The common myna was introduced in Durban in 1902 and has become common in Kwa-Zulu Natal and has spread further north to Gauteng. Fortunately, it has no significant impact on rural and natural habitats.|$|R
50|$|Locally rare native {{bird species}} {{that have been}} {{recorded}} in the park include little egret, laughing kookaburra, Australian shelduck, Cape Barren goose, great-crested grebe, white-bellied sea eagle and whiskered tern, while little ravens, Australian magpies, long-billed corella, sulphur-crested cockatoo, willie wagtails and magpie-larks are common. Common lake birds include black swans and Pacific black ducks, Australasian grebe, Eurasian coots, purple swamphen, dusky moorhen and all four freshwater cormorant species. Feral white swans {{were removed from the}} park between the 1980s and 1990s. Feral common <b>mynas</b> and common <b>starling</b> are also numerous in the park.|$|R
50|$|The {{breeding}} range of this bird is from easternmost Europe across temperate southern Asia. It {{is a strong}} migrant, and winters in India and tropical Asia. In India in winter, it often appears to outnumber the local <b>starlings</b> and <b>mynas.</b> The rosy <b>starling</b> is a bird of steppe and open agricultural land. In years when grasshoppers and other insects are abundant, it will erupt well beyond its core range, with significant numbers reaching France and the United Kingdom. The starling is a summer visitor for northwestern Afghanistan, passage migrants {{in the rest of}} the Afghanistan and winter visitor in almost entire world population in Sri Lanka and India including the southern India including Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.|$|R
40|$|Santalum album, {{a medium}} sized {{evergreen}} tree found in dry forest tracts of the Deccan Peninsula, India is vulnerable (IUCN) and red listed species in southern India. The paper discusses {{the role of}} avian frugivores in seed dissemination of S. album in Tamil Nadu. Observations from different locations of Western and Eastern Ghats of Tamil Nadu are presented. The forest type of the study sites comprise of southern dry mixed deciduous forest. Extended watches of 3 -hr duration were made on focal trees. During the extended observations, the observer noted {{the name of the}} visitor, frequency of fruit-feeding visits by different species, and fruit handling behaviour. A total of 10 species of birds and Three-striped Palm Squirrel foraged fruit crops. Birds constituted the principal seed dispersers of Santalum album. Role of Indian Grey Hornbill in regeneration of S. album was evidenced by the presence of sandalwood seedlings in hornbillâ€™s nest middens. Although bulbuls made frequent foraging visits, they ate the fruits in piecemeal and did not move the seeds away from the parent trees. Among the avian foragers, Asian Koel, Common <b>Myna,</b> Brahminy <b>Starling,</b> Brown-headed Barbet, White-headed Babbler and Indian Grey Hornbill constituted the major seed dispersers of S. album. These birds visited the fruit crops more frequently and swallowed the fruits wholly. Conservation efforts need to focus in providing a healthy habitat for the seed dispersing birds such as koel, as the population of sandalwood tree is dwindling in the wild...|$|R
