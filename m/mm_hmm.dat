40|$|This study explores English {{language}} pragmatic {{phenomena in}} the Mandarin speech {{of a native}} Chinese language teacher as she interacts with American learners of Mandarin in a university classroom setting. I document and analyze her use of English backchannel 2 ̆ 7 <b>mm</b> <b>hmm</b> 2 ̆ 7 in interactions that are otherwise in Mandarin, and I document and analyze the transfer of American interaction rituals and English syntax to her Mandarin language interactions with students. In this context, her patterns of communication both reflect and constitute cultural worlds. These pragmatic transfers to her Mandarin reflect her cultural and communicative assimilation to America, but they also serve to constitute pedagogical contexts that are familiar to American students and may facilitate their learning, and they serve to constitute a sojourner Chinese scholar identity for the teacher...|$|E

40|$|The unlabeled (cold) minimal model (MM) and the labeled (hot) minimal model (HMM) are a {{powerful}} tool to investigate in vivo metabolism from a standard intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) or hot IVGTT (HIVGTT). They allow to estimate metabolic indexes of the glucose-insulin system, namely glucose effectiveness (GE) and insulin sensitivity (IS) (of uptake and production those of MM, and of uptake only those of HMM). Here, {{the consequences of the}} single-compartment glucose kinetics approximation used in the MM's are investigated via Monte Carlo simulation, using a physiologic reference model (RM) of the system. RM allows to generate noisy synthetic plasma concentrations of glucose, tracer glucose, and insulin during IVGTT and HIVGTT, which are then analyzed with <b>MM</b> and <b>HMM.</b> The <b>MM</b> and <b>HMM</b> GE and IS are then compared with the RM ones. Results of 400 runs show that: 1) correlation of MM GE with the RM index is weak; 2) MM IS is well correlated with the RM index, but severely underestimates it; 3) HMM clearance rate is correlated with RM clearance; and 4) HMM IS is well correlated and only slightly overestimates the RM index. These results demonstrate that GE of MM is most affected by the single-compartment approximation and the indexes of HMM are more robust than those of MM...|$|R
40|$|Multiple myeloma (MM) is {{a cancer}} of antibody-making plasma cells. It {{frequently}} harbors alterations in DNA and chromosome copy numbers, {{and can be}} divided into two major subtypes, hyperdiploid (HMM) and non-hyperdiploid multiple myeloma (NHMM). The two subtypes have different survival prognosis, possibly due to different but converging paths to oncogenesis. Existing methods for identifying the two subtypes are fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and copy number microarrays, with increased cost and sample requirements. We hypothesize that chromosome alterations have their imprint in gene expression through dosage effect. Using five MM expression datasets that have HMM status measured by FISH and copy number microarrays, we have developed and validated a K-nearest-neighbor method to classify <b>MM</b> into <b>HMM</b> and NHMM based on gene expression profiles. Classification accuracy for test datasets ranges from 0. 83 to 0. 88. This classification will enable researchers to study differences and commonalities of the two MM subtypes in disease biology and prognosis using expression datasets without need for additional subtype measurements. Our study also supports the advantages of using cancer specific characteristics in feature design and pooling multiple rounds of classification results t...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTwo speech {{inversion}} {{methods are}} implemented and compared. In the first, multistream Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) of phonemes are jointly trained from synchronous streams of articulatory data acquired by EMA and speech spectral parameters; an acoustic recognition system uses the acoustic {{part of the}} HMMs to deliver a phoneme chain and the states durations; this information is then used by a trajectory formation procedure based on the articulatory part of the HMMs to resynthesise the articulatory data. In the second, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are trained on these streams to associate directly articulatory frames with acoustic frames in context. Over a corpus of 17 minutes uttered by a French speaker, the RMS error was 1, 66 <b>mm</b> with the <b>HMMs</b> and 2, 25 mm with the GMMs...|$|R
