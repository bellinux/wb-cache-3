25|$|As {{with most}} European standards, {{compliance}} by the member {{countries of the}} European Union is purely voluntary, and to be determined {{at the level of}} the member country, usually by means of legislation, or by its own standards organization. To illustrate, this standard, which has been accepted by the United Kingdom, is known locally as BS EN 1789:2007, with the 'BS' referring to British Standards. As a result, the adoption of this standard has varied considerably from one country to another. Most countries, for example, have adopted the sections dealing with vehicle design and performance, while only a few (the UK, Ireland, and Sweden at this writing), have fully adopted the colour, warning system, and livery schemes for such vehicles. To further complicate matters, some countries have adopted some portion of the visual identity standards, but not all. In the Netherlands, Belgium, and some parts of Germany, the conversion to the basic identifying colour (yellow) is occurring, but the balance of visual identity provisions are not. In addition, some countries which are not currently members of the European Union, such as Norway are adopting some portions of the standards, primarily because few other good standards exist for this purpose, particularly those that reflect European realities. The rate and degree of compliance with the standard is a conscious choice by individual countries, while in others, compliance is a matter of the priorities for the changing of older, country specific, legislation. As previously stated, compliance with the standard is purely voluntary. There are no untoward financial implications to compliance, since only ambulances purchased after ratification of the standard by each country are required to be compliant. There is no <b>mandatory</b> <b>provision</b> for the retrofitting of existing ambulances.|$|E

In particular the application of overriding <b>mandatory</b> <b>provisions</b> might disturb the planned operation of CESL and render the desired harmonisation illusory. This should be taken as a reason to rethink the overly broad definition of overriding <b>mandatory</b> <b>provisions</b> under the Rome I Regulation and rationalise this intruder into the conflict of laws system...|$|R

The elements are: the <b>mandatory</b> <b>provision</b> of reception facilities in all ports; the mandatory use of such facilities by all ships; notification requirements on all ships; a mandatory common charging system; and compliance provisions.

This paper, informed by the experience of Hablamos Juntos, a national demonstration project funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, argues that national and health industry investments are needed to develop population-based approaches supported by communication and information technology, and that these investments may prove useful to improving healthcare communication for English-speaking patients as well.

30|$|An {{alternative}} {{mechanism that}} could explain our results is the <b>mandatory</b> <b>provision</b> {{of child care}} facilities at NREGS work sites. Mothers who participated in NREGS work may have had better access to child care facilities. This would free up the time of school-going age siblings, particularly girls, who could then attend school more regularly. The 2007 YLS survey respondents were asked whether the NREGS participant had “benefited from child care facilities at the worksite.” In the 2009 – 2010 survey, the respondents were asked: “Were there child care facilities in the last (NREGS) worksite?” Only 1  % of households report using on-site child care facilities in 2007 while more than 80  % of households report absence of child care facilities at the last worksite in 2009 – 2010. We, therefore, do not consider this as a valid explanation of our findings.|$|E

We analyze a model of multi-product monopoly with horizontal differentiation and random country-specific input costs. We find that if the variability in the input costs is sufficiently high and the share of consumers with high valuations is in some intermediate range, the seller prefers to withhold information about product origin. Mandatory labeling of products with their country of origin may reduce or increase welfare depending on the share of consumers with high valuations. We also discuss extensions of the basic model that allow for continuous distributions of valuations and input costs, and consumer learning.

40|$|Background: Research, {{education}} and extension are integral parts of any University system. The reputation of any University depends on quality {{of research and}} education. Various assessment, accreditation and ranking agencies worldwide give substantial weightage to {{quality and quantity of}} research undertaken by faculty and students of the University. Research quality, quantity and impact can be measured by various ways. The number of quality publications in peer reviewed reputed journals, their citations and utility of patents are commonly used for such metrics. Higher the number of quality research publications, citations and patents, higher is the academic reputation of the University. Research publications carry substantial weight in the faculty selection, promotions, increment and academic performance index (API) as advised by the University Grants Commission (UGC).
