This approach generated 416 equivalence classes, somewhat less effective than the theoretical 336 <b>minimum</b> <b>limit</b> for a full reduction. Application of counting symmetry patterns for duplicate paired digits achieved reduction to 174 and then to 71 equivalence classes. The introduction of equivalence classes based on band counting symmetry (subsequent to Felgenhauer/Jarvis by Russell) reduced the equivalence classes to a minimum generating set of 44.|$|E
25|$|As {{the feature}} size of flash memory cells reaches the 15-16 nm <b>minimum</b> <b>limit,</b> further flash density {{increases}} will {{be driven by}} TLC (3bits/cell) combined with vertical stacking of NAND memory planes. The decrease in endurance and increase in uncorrectable bit error rates that accompany feature size shrinking can be compensated by improved error correction mechanisms. Even with these advances, it may be impossible to economically scale flash to smaller and smaller dimensions {{as the number of}} electron holding capacity reduces. Many promising new technologies (such as FeRAM, MRAM, PMC, PCM, ReRAM, and others) are under investigation and development as possible more scalable replacements for flash.|$|E

Michael Rasmussen was known for his care for detail when considering weight. With a low weight (60kg) he was usually one of the lightest riders in his class. He was known for peeling off unnecessary stickers from his bike, not wearing the Livestrong wristband which was common among many Tour de France riders, due to the additional grams. He used to count each grain of rice before eating and had water with his breakfast cereal, instead of milk.

25|$|In {{the second}} book, Hipparchus starts from the {{opposite}} extreme assumption: he assigns a (minimum) distance to the Sun of 490 Earth radii. This would correspond to a parallax of 7', which is apparently the greatest parallax that Hipparchus thought would not be noticed (for comparison: the typical resolution of the human eye is about 2'; Tycho Brahe made naked eye observation with an accuracy down to 1'). In this case, {{the shadow of the}} Earth is a cone rather than a cylinder as under the first assumption. Hipparchus observed (at lunar eclipses) that at the mean distance of the Moon, the diameter of the shadow cone is 2+½ lunar diameters. That apparent diameter is, as he had observed, 360/650 degrees. With these values and simple geometry, Hipparchus could determine the mean distance; because it was computed for a minimum distance of the Sun, it is the maximum mean distance possible for the Moon. With his value for the eccentricity of the orbit, he could compute the least and greatest distances of the Moon too. According to Pappus, he found a least distance of 62, a mean of 67+1/3, and consequently a greatest distance of 72+2/3 Earth radii. With this method, as the parallax of the Sun decreases (i.e., its distance increases), the <b>minimum</b> <b>limit</b> for the mean distance is 59 Earth radii – exactly the mean distance that Ptolemy later derived.|$|E

40|$|High-latitude {{landscape}} evolution processes {{have the}} potential to preserve old, relict surfaces through burial by cold-based, nonerosive glacial ice. To investigate landscape history and age in the high Arctic, we analyzed in situ cosmogenic 10 Be and 26 Al in 33 rocks from Upernavik, northwest Greenland. We sampled adjacent bedrock-boulder pairs along a 100 km transect at elevations up to 1000 m above sea level. Bedrock samples gave signifi cantly older apparent exposure ages than corresponding boulder samples, and <b>minimum</b> <b>limiting</b> ages increased with elevation. Two-isotope calculations (26 Al/ 10 Be) on 20 of the 33 samples yielded <b>minimum</b> <b>limiting</b> exposure durations up to 112 k. y., <b>minimum</b> <b>limiting</b> burial durations up to 900 k. y., and <b>minimum</b> <b>limiting</b> total histories up to 990 k. y. The prevalence of 10 Be and 26 Al inherited from previous periods of exposure, especially in bedrock samples at high elevation, indicates that these areas record long and complex surface exposure histories, including signifi cant periods of burial with little subglacial erosion. The long total histories suggest that these highelevation surfaces were largely preserved beneath cold-based, nonerosive ice or snowfi elds for at least {{the latter half of the}} Quaternary. Because of high concentrations of inherited nuclides, only the six youngest boulder samples appear to record the timing of ice retreat. These six samples suggest deglaciation of the Upernavik coast at 11. 3 ± 0. 5 ka (average ± 1 standard deviation). There is no difference in deglaciation age along the 100 km sample transect, indicating that the ice-marginal position retreated rapidly at rates of 120 m yr− 1...|$|R
