40|$|Receptor-mediated {{targeting}} of nano-metric drug or contrast agent carriers holds {{great potential for}} treating cardiovascular and vascular-associated diseases. However, predicting the adhesive behavior of these vectors under dynamic conditions is complex due to the interplay of transport, hydrodynamic force and multivalent bond formation dynamics. To address this problem we first developing techniques to analyze multivalent particle adhesion using data that was generated using a model nanocarrier comprised of a 200 nm diameter polystyrene particle coated with monoclonal antibody (Chapter 3). These analytical techniques included a transport-reaction model to track particle species, account for transport phenomena and define kinetic parameters for attachment and detachment. In addition, since particles displayed history-dependent detachment behavior, we employed a Monte Carlo simulation to recreate binding data by stochastically sampling for detachment events based on a time-dependent detachment rate. Next we extended the model system to include 40 nm and 1 µm particles, and demonstrated that size can dramatically affect both carrier recruitment efficiency and bound-state stability (Chapter 4). This included influences from both fluid flow dependent factors {{as well as the}} size of the contact area. Furthermore, we demonstrated how particle size can be exploited to engineer delivery carriers with optimal binding characteristics for given therapeutic applications. Next we examined the dependence of receptor/ligand bond properties on nanoparticle <b>adhesion</b> using numerous <b>molecular</b> <b>adhesion</b> <b>systems,</b> including recombinant antibody fragment proteins engineered with specific kinetic and structural characteristics (Chapter 5). Using these systems we demonstrated a significant role for receptor size but observed limited influences from kinetics and mechanics. Finally, we developed a novel single-chain antibody that was specific for VCAM- 1 and demonstrated that it can effectively mediate nanoparticle binding under flow, and thus could serve as a viable option to target nanocarriers to VCAM- 1 related pathologies such as atherosclerosis and inflammation (Chapter 6). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that targeted nanocarrier adhesion can be engineered through appropriate selection of carrier size, molecular binding efficiency and valency tuning, which could hold important implications for optimizing the efficacy of targeted therapies. ...|$|R

40|$|Early hair {{follicle}} morphogenesis proceeds with {{the formation of}} a hair placode, the downgrowth of the hair plug into the mesenchyme, and the development of an elongated {{hair follicle}} - processes that involve a series of exchange of messages between epithelium and mesenchyme. Regulation of epithelial cell adhesion during hair morphogenesis has been demonstrated in terms of the changing expression patterns of E- and P-cadherins. In this study, distribution patterns of several major components of desmosomes and hemidesmosomes, which are the most prominent cell <b>adhesion</b> <b>systems</b> in epidermal tissues, were examined during early morphogenesis of mouse pelage hair follicles. We found that both desmosomal and hemidesmosomal <b>adhesion</b> <b>systems</b> became downregulated in hair placodes and were much reduced or almost lost in hair plugs, which persisted in the region containing hair matrix. Downregulation of the <b>adhesion</b> <b>systems</b> in hair plugs was confirmed by electron microscopy.

Upon modulus gradation, multiple molecular bonds can be elastically decoupled but statistically cooperative.

40|$|SummaryBasement {{membrane}} (BM), a sheet-like form of extracellular matrix, surrounds most tissues. During organogenesis, specific adhesions between adjoining tissues frequently occur; however, their {{molecular basis}} is unclear. Using live-cell imaging and electron microscopy, we identify an <b>adhesion</b> <b>system</b> {{that connects the}} uterine and gonadal tissues through their juxtaposed BMs {{at the site of}} anchor cell (AC) invasion in C.  elegans. We find that the extracellular matrix component hemicentin (HIM- 4), found between BMs, forms punctate accumulations under the AC and controls BM linkage to promote rapid invasion. Through targeted screening, we identify the integrin-binding cytolinker plakin (VAB- 10 A) and integrin (INA- 1 /PAT- 3) as key BM-BM linkage regulators: VAB- 10 A localizes to the AC-BM interface and tethers hemicentin to the AC while integrin promotes hemicentin punctae formation. Together, plakin, integrin, and hemicentin are founding components of a cell-directed <b>adhesion</b> <b>system,</b> which we name a BM-LINKage (B-LINK), that connects adjacent tissues through adjoining BMs...|$|R

Additionally, acyl hydrazones have been shown to inhibit the Wnt signaling characteristic of many cancers by destabilizing β-catenin, thus disrupting Wnt signaling and preventing the aberrant cell growth associated with cancer.

The neuroligin-neurexin complex is a heterophilic <b>adhesion</b> <b>system</b> that promotes assembly and maturation of synapses through bidirectional signaling. In this protein complex, postsynaptic neuroligins are thought to interact trans-synaptically with presynaptic neurexins. However, the subcellular localization of neurexins has not been determined.

Unexpectedly, neurexins are also abundant in the postsynaptic density. cis-expression of neurexin- 1 beta with neuroligin- 1 inhibits trans-binding to recombinant neurexins, blocks the synaptogenic activity of neuroligin- 1, and reduces the density of presynaptic terminals in cultured hippocampal neurons.
