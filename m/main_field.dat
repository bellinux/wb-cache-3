5|$|A {{trap crop}} is {{a crop of}} a plant that attracts pests, {{diverting}} them from nearby crops. Pests aggregated on the trap crop can be more easily controlled using pesticides or other methods. However, trap-cropping, on its own, has often failed to cost effectively reduce pest densities on large commercial scales, {{without the use of}} pesticides, possibly due to the pests' ability to disperse back into the <b>main</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{was decided}} to station the Chinooks at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, located at the {{midpoint}} between the Army's <b>main</b> <b>field</b> formations based in the outskirts of Sydney in New South Wales and the north Queensland city of Townsville. Construction began on support facilities for the helicopters at Amberley shortly after the order for them was confirmed in 1972.|$|E
5|$|An {{electric}} field generally varies in space, and its strength {{at any one}} point {{is defined as the}} force (per unit charge) that would be felt by a stationary, negligible charge if placed at that point. The conceptual charge, termed a 'test charge', must be vanishingly small to prevent its own {{electric field}} disturbing the <b>main</b> <b>field</b> and must also be stationary to prevent the effect of magnetic fields. As the electric field is defined in terms of force, and force is a vector, so it follows that an electric field is also a vector, having both magnitude and direction. Specifically, it is a vector field.|$|E

5|$|The Indians were {{a harder}} fight; {{they were out}} of the <b>main</b> <b>field</b> of battle, skirmishing on the edge of an {{adjacent}} swamp. Richard Johnson eventually ordered a suicide squad of twenty men to ride forward and draw the Indians' fire, planning to charge with the rest as they reloaded. But the ground before the Indian position was too swampy to support many cavalry. Johnson had to order his men to dismount and hold until Shelby's infantry came up. But eventually they broke, and fled into the swamp, during which time Tecumseh was slain, some say by Johnson, others believing it was someone else.|$|E
5|$|Construction of Lerkendal {{started as}} a public works during the 1930s, as a measure to create jobs. It opened on 10 August 1947, and {{consisted}} of a main grass field, two gravel fields, two handball courts and two tennis courts. The <b>main</b> <b>field</b> had a spectator capacity for 37,000 on temporary stands, making it the second-largest stadium in the country. The long sides consisted of temporary wooden stands, with seating on the south stand and standing places on terraces on the north stand. The end sides of the stadium consisted of grass embankments at a 30 percent angle, allowing for standing space for spectators without having to build stands. Changing rooms were located in a nearby German-built barracks dating from the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Cousin took ninth at the Polynormande, {{in fourth}} {{position}} from the peloton behind five breakaway riders. Haddou took fifth {{in a field}} sprint at the Châteauroux Classic, behind 's Anthony Ravard. Voeckler took a podium finish at the GP Ouest-France. 's Grega Bole broke away in the final kilometer to win the race, and Simon Gerrans and Voeckler tried to bridge up to him. Though everyone in the peloton had the same time at the finish, Bole, Gerrans, and Voeckler finished {{just ahead of the}} <b>main</b> <b>field,</b> in that order to round out the podium. Voeckler also turned in the team's best ride at the Tour de la Somme, finishing ninth in the field sprint. At the Tour de Vendée, which took place not far from the team's headquarters, they had two riders take top-ten placings, Charteau in sixth and Quemeneur in seventh.|$|E

5|$|Stage 11 into L'Aquila {{provided}} for major {{changes to the}} overall standings. More than 50 riders formed the day's escape group, and they quickly took 20 minutes advantage. Among them were Sastre, Wiggins, and 's Richie Porte, who was holding the white jersey as best young rider and, at sixth overall, was the best-placed man in the group. Sastre, Wiggins, and Porte all had multiple support riders {{with them in the}} breakaway who set strenuous paces to keep the group away. The <b>main</b> <b>field,</b> containing the Giro's top favorites, pulled back a little time but was still nearly 13 minutes behind stage winner Evgeni Petrov at the finish. The day's result massively shuffled the overall classification. Porte was the only rider {{who had been in the}} top ten before the stage who remained there afterward, and took the pink jersey. Sastre and Wiggins, who entered the Giro as contenders but had fallen well back in the overall standings before this stage, both moved back into the top ten.|$|E
5|$|The event's tenth stage {{featured}} a summit finish to Monte Terminillo. The general classification contenders {{were all in}} a group together {{as they reached the}} final climb of the day. Piotr Ugrumov {{was the first of the}} group to attack and was joined by Roberto Conti shortly after. Behind, Indurain led a chase group that contained Andrew Hampsten, Chiappucci, Giovannetti, and Luis Herrera, while general classification hopefuls Chioccioli and Fignon dropped off the back since they could not keep pace. The group caught Conti, who was alone after Ugrumov slowed, and from there, Herrera attacked to win the stage. The next day's route was an undulating one. Chioccioli, Roberto Pagnin, and Marco Lietti formed a breakaway group and gained an advantage of three and a half minutes over the <b>main</b> <b>field</b> which was led by Indurain's team, Banesto. The group remained in front, Pagnin took the stage victory, and Indurain finished over two minutes later. With around nine kilometers remaining in the twelfth stage, there was an accident that saw Chiappicci and Giovannetti amongst others go down. The peloton continued on, gearing up for a sprint finish that Leoni won.|$|E
5|$|The team {{took several}} wins in August. Dumoulin took a {{win in the}} first stage of Paris–Corrèze, {{breaking}} away {{near the end of the}} day to finish 4 seconds better than the <b>main</b> <b>field.</b> By finishing in the front group the next day, he secured overall victory in the two-day event. On the same day Dumoulin secured Paris–Corrèze, Cusin narrowly defeated 's Matti Breschel at the end of stage 2 at the Tour of Denmark. After laying 28 seconds down in the overall classification before the final day at the Tour de l'Ain, Moncoutié secured overall victory the next day. He missed out on the stage win to 's Thibaut Pinot, but by finishing only 3 seconds back he moved past previous race leader Wout Poels to win the event itself. Lastly, Gallopin took a stage at the Tour du Limousin. He took his second win of the season by breaking away from the peloton within stage's final kilometer, and holding on for first by 6 seconds.|$|E

5|$|Neither {{dropped below}} 11th place overall {{heading into the}} stage 10 {{individual}} time trial, where the squad had three riders finish in the top ten. Cancellara's fourth-place ride was perhaps a disappointment, in that he finished a minute and 27 seconds slower than the stage winner Tony Martin, the rider seen as his chief rival for the world championships time trial. Fuglsang took sixth on the day and Monfort tenth, putting Fuglsang 12 seconds off the race lead in second place overall and Monfort sixth 59 seconds back. Both of them lost time in stage 11, finishing in a group 27 seconds back of the group containing most of the race's top riders, but both remained in the top ten overall. Both again fell down the standings in stage 14 on La Farrapona, a day when {{out of the first}} 50 riders no more than four finished together. Their overall positions reversed the next day on the storied Alto del Angliru. Monfort finished with a group that lost time to only six riders, while Fuglsang was a further minute and eight seconds down the road from his teammate. This left Monfort fifth overall and Fuglsang seventh, after Fuglsang had been the higher-placed of the two for the entire race to that point. The next major mountain was Peña Cabarga in stage 17. Both riders were well off the pace, with Monfort finishing 19th and Fuglsang 31st. Monfort still held sixth overall with the result, but Fuglsang fell out of the top ten, down to 12th place. Fuglsang improved a place to 11th after stage 19, when Wouter Poels, who had been ahead of him, finished six minutes behind the <b>main</b> <b>field.</b> Those were their final overall positions, with both Monfort's sixth place and Fuglsang's 11th representing the best such finishes for either of them in a Grand Tour. The day before the race ended, Bennati gave the team a second stage win, coming home first in a large sprint finish in stage 20 at Vitoria.|$|E
5|$|The {{first modern}} historians {{to deal with}} the reign of Edward II – William Stubbs, Thomas Frederick Tout and James Conway Davies – added little to the {{understanding}} of Gaveston. While generally agreeing with the chronicles, they allotted him no importance within their own <b>main</b> <b>field</b> of interest, that of constitutional history. For later generations of historians, the focus shifted from constitutional to personal issues. From the 1970s onwards, the topic of study became the personal relations between magnates and the crown, and the distribution of patronage. It is to this school of thought that Hamilton's biography belongs, in which he argues that it was Gaveston's exclusive access to royal patronage that was {{the driving force behind the}} baronial animosity towards him. Chaplais, on the other hand, takes a different approach to the study of Gaveston and his place in the reign of Edward II. According to Chaplais, Edward was more or less indifferent to the practice of kingship, and essentially delegated the job to Gaveston. As an alternative to a homosexual relationship, Chaplais suggests that the bond that existed between the King and Gaveston was that of an adoptive brotherhood. This concept had a Biblical precedent in the traditionalist, platonic interpretation of the relationship between David and Jonathan, and also existed in the Middle Ages, as exemplified in The Song of Roland, the story of Roland and Olivier.|$|E
5|$|The {{team was}} {{successful}} in stage-hunting at events later in the season. Chavanel took his first win since rejoining the team, and first in three years, at the Circuit de Lorraine, winning a nearly full field sprint. Kern took a strong win at the Critérium du Dauphiné, finishing alone 9 seconds clear of the <b>main</b> <b>field</b> full {{of some of the}} best climbers in the world, atop the short, steep climb at Les Gets. The team had been very active in the finale, with Rolland and Voeckler launching attacks in the run into the finish before Kern got clear. The team's performances on the race's last day got them the victory in the race's teams classification as well. Later in June, Turgot won the prologue time trial at the Boucles de la Mayenne, besting 's Alexander Wetterhall by less than a second. The squad won the team award at this race as well. Charteau showed his climbing prowess and cunning in stage 2 at the Route du Sud, outpacing 's Vasil Kiryienka to win alone on a Pyreneean hilltop in Cauterets. The team did not win any stage at the Tour du Poitou-Charentes, but they did win two jersey classifications, with Pichot taking the mountains classification and Gaudin the sprints.|$|E
