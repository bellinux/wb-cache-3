40|$|In {{the context}} of a {{probabilistic}} voting model with dichotomous choice, we investigate the consequences of choosing among voting rules according to the <b>maximin</b> <b>criterion.</b> A voting rule is the minimum number of voters who vote favorably on a change from the status quo required for it to be adopted. We characterize the voting rules that satisfy the <b>maximin</b> <b>criterion</b> {{as a function of the}} distribution of voters’ probabilities to favor change from the status quo. We prove that there are at most two maximin voting rules, at least one is Pareto efficient and is often different to the simple majority rule. If a committee is formed only by “conservative voters” (i. e. voters who are more likely to prefer the status quo to change) then the <b>maximin</b> <b>criterion</b> recommends voting rules that require no more voters supporting change than the simple majority rule. If there are only “radical voters”, then this criterion recommends voting rules that require no less than half of the total number of votes.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the application of the Islamic financing method based on direct musharakah to the conventional capital asset pricing model yielding several interesting hypotheses. Design/methodology/approach – Theoretical methodology, with <b>maximin</b> <b>criteria,</b> and rational economic optimization. Findings – There are four major findings. First, an Islamic financing partnership based on complementary capital is proven to necessarily yield a lower beta-risk of investments than that compared to the market. Second, in order for the above conclusion to hold, capital lenders (such as banks) must abide by a maximum partnership share inversely proportional to project risk and increasing with opportunity cost of capital. Third, the sum of lender's share and relative risk level balances to unity at equilibrium. Hence, tradeoffs exist in risk-shares and not in risk-returns. Fourth, without accounting for inflation, and in contrast to predetermined fixed interest, a maximin strategy of financing partnerships (maximum return with minimum risk) imply an existence of an optimum zero risk-free rate. Research limitations/implications – The paper's findings are limited to a Direct Musharakah Partnership. Originality/value – A comparison between Islamic risks and returns to conventional risk management is deduced. Several implications on the conduct of Islamic financing are discussed...|$|E
40|$|International {{conference on}} {{sensitivity}} analysis of model output, La Réunion, FRA, 30 -/ 11 / 2016 - 03 / 12 / 2016 International audienceIrstea developed a methodology which allows designing site-specific VFS by simulating their efficiency to limit transfers among a hillslope. The modeling toolkit BUVARD (BUffer strip for runoff Attenuation and pesticides Retention Design tool) consists in several steps like analyzing the watershed and its characteristics (soil, climate, cultural practices), and running dynamical models, {{in particular the}} mechanistic model VFSMOD (Munoz-Carpena et al., 1999). At the end this toolkit delivers the optimal VFS width considering the needed filter efficiency (for example, 70 % of runoff reduction). The present study aims at making possible to simplify this very complete method, to determine its sensitivity to input parameters in new climatic and agronomic conditions by reducing the computational cost of the modeling toolkit. A metamodel (or surrogate model) developed on local conditions would allow to perform GSA with low cost yet ensuring {{it is based on}} physics. It would help users understanding the most important processes in the VFS they want to design and would increase the operational scope of the modeling toolkit. We performed a much smaller sampling of input parameters using the Latin Hypercube Sampling method optimized with a <b>maximin</b> <b>criteria.</b> The metamodel is then be based on a Kriging approach with a very good quality of prediction. It is a promising tool to perform uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis at alow cost...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} maximin and Bayesian $D$-optimal {{designs for}} nonlinear regression models. The <b>maximin</b> <b>criterion</b> requires the specification {{of a region}} for the nonlinear parameters in the model, while the Bayesian optimality criterion assumes that a prior for these parameters is available.

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} the question, how environmental policy decisions under uncertainty {{depend on the}} underlying welfare concept. We study three different welfare measures: The first is directly based on the ex ante (expected) utility of a representative consumer whereas the second and the third {{are based on a}} valuation of policy changes compared to the status quo. Here the second criterion is based on the ex ante, the third on the ex post willingness-to-pay for policy changes with respect to the status quo. We show that decisions based on these measures coincide if and only if a risk neutral expected utility maximization is applied. Differences between the decisions are analyzed for both, risk averse expected utility maximization and the <b>MaxiMin</b> <b>criterion.</b> For risk-averse decision makers differences between the first and the second concept arise if the absolute risk-aversion of the decision maker is not constant in income. For risk aversion and the <b>MaxiMin</b> <b>criterion,</b> emission levels based on an optimization of ex post utility changes, e. g. abatement costs, exceed those based on the first or second concept if a reduction of emissions is socially optimal. Implications for applying the concepts of abatement costs and benefits from abatement are discussed. ...|$|R
