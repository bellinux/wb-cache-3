40|$|Short fiber-reinforced {{semi-solid}} fresh cement pastes and mortars, tailored for extrusion, {{have much}} lower water-to-binder ratio and higher viscosity than normal cement pastes <b>or</b> <b>mortars.</b> The rheology of these pastes <b>or</b> <b>mortars</b> cannot {{be characterized by}} traditional rheology test methods suitable for normal fresh cement pastes <b>or</b> <b>mortars</b> with much greater water-to-binder ratio and lower viscosity. In this paper, orifice extrusion is employed to calibrate rheology of the semi-solid fresh cement mortar. An analytical model is developed for orifice extrusion of semi-solid pastes and mortars obeying a rigid-viscoplastic constitutive relationship, von-Mises yield criterion and the associated flow rule. Orifice extrusion results are interpreted using the analytical model and the established experiment data interpretation method, and the associated rheological parameters are derived for the semi-solid fresh cement mortar. This study provides a simple analytical model, together with experiment and data interpretation methods, for characterizing the complex intrinsic rheological behavior of semi-solid fresh cement pastes <b>or</b> <b>mortars.</b> (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|In {{simple terms}} rising damp occurs when ground water travels upwards through porous {{building}} {{materials such as}} brick, sandstone, <b>or</b> <b>mortar,</b> much {{in the same way}} that oil travels upwards through the wick of a lamp. The effect can easily be seen by simply placing a piece of porous brick, stone, <b>or</b> <b>mortar</b> in a shallow tray of water and observing how the water is absorbed into the porous material and is transported above the water line.|$|R

40|$|The {{determination}} {{of the extent of}} carbonation in concrete and mortars is important in assessing the extent of curing that has occurred. Many factors affect the curing process, including the reaction of the CO 2 in the atmosphere with lime in the concrete <b>or</b> <b>mortar,</b> to form calcium carbonate. The carbonation process is accompanied by a loss of basicity.
