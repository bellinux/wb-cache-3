A project to insert barcodes into each book, begun in the late 1970s, had some 1million volumes yet to reach as of 2006.|$|E
6000|$|The cabman left me; {{but after}} awhile I picked up another man, who {{was full of}} figures, and into my ears he poured them as {{occasion}} required or the big blank factories suggested.

5|$|The grey-headed {{flying fox}} {{is now a}} {{prominent}} federal conservation problem in Australia. Early in the last century, the species was considered abundant, with numbers estimated in the <b>many</b> <b>millions.</b> In recent years, though, direct evidence has been accumulating that the species is in serious decline. Current estimates for the species are between 200,000 - 300,000 and the national population may have declined by over 30% between 1989 and 1999 alone.|$|E
5|$|The {{proximity}} of the Peak to major conurbations and urban areas (an estimated 20 million people live within an hour's drive) poses unique challenges for managing the area. The Peak District National Park Authority and the National Trust, with other landowners, attempt to balance keeping the upland landscape accessible to visitors for recreation, whilst protecting it from intensive farming, erosion and pressure from visitors themselves. An inevitable tension exists between {{the needs of the}} 38,000 residents of the Peak District National Park, the needs of the <b>many</b> <b>millions</b> of people who visit it annually, and the conservation requirements of the area.|$|E
5|$|These claims {{challenge}} the title {{not only of}} every purchaser and holder of lands {{within the boundaries of}} the grant of August 31, 1826, but also the title to <b>many</b> <b>millions</b> of acres of lands in this state, held under Indian treaties made by the state of New York with the Indian tribes within its borders, or under grants made by Indians to individuals under the authority of the state, where no treaty had been made between the United States and the Indian occupants.|$|E

5|$|After 150 {{million years}} of volcanism, plutonism, metamorphism, and thrust {{faulting}} had run their course, {{the early part}} of the Cenozoic era (early Tertiary, 6530 Ma) was a time of repose; neither igneous nor sedimentary rocks of this age are known here. A relatively featureless plain was created from erosion over <b>many</b> <b>millions</b> of years. Deposition resumed some 35 Ma in the Oligocene epoch on a flood plain that developed in the area; sluggish streams migrated laterally over the surface, laying down cobbles, sand, and mud. Outcrops of the resulting conglomerates, sandstone, and mudstone of the Titus Canyon Formation can be observed in road cuts at Daylight Pass on Daylight Pass Road, which becomes State Route 374 a short distance from the pass. Several other similar formations were also laid down.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{lithosphere}} {{is divided}} into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over periods of <b>many</b> <b>millions</b> of years. About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water, mostly by oceans. The remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands that together have many lakes, rivers and other sources of water {{that contribute to the}} hydrosphere. The majority of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack. Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates the Earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|Like all catalysts, enzymes {{increase}} the reaction rate by lowering its activation energy. Some enzymes {{can make their}} conversion of substrate to product occur <b>many</b> <b>millions</b> of times faster. An extreme example is orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase, which allows a reaction that would otherwise take millions of years to occur in milliseconds. Chemically, enzymes are like any catalyst and are not consumed in chemical reactions, nor do they alter the equilibrium of a reaction. Enzymes differ from most other catalysts by being much more specific. Enzyme activity can be affected by other molecules: inhibitors are molecules that decrease enzyme activity, and activators are molecules that increase activity. Many therapeutic drugs and poisons are enzyme inhibitors. An enzyme's activity decreases markedly outside its optimal temperature and pH.|$|E

6000|$|I spent {{ten hours}} in that huge wilderness, {{wandering}} through scores {{of miles of}} these terrible streets, and jostling some few hundred thousand of these terrible people who talked money through their noses. The cabman left me: {{but after a while}} I picked up another man who was full of figures, and into my ears he poured them as occasion required or the big blank factories suggested. Here they turned out so many hundred thousand dollars' worth of such and such an article; there so <b>many</b> <b>million</b> other things; this house was worth so <b>many</b> <b>million</b> dollars; that one so <b>many</b> <b>million</b> more or less.

He demanded that I should admire; and the utmost that I could say was: [...] "Are these things so? Then I am very sorry for you." [...] That made him angry, and he said that insular envy made me unresponsive. So, you see, I could not make him understand.|$|R
50|$|This {{method is}} {{especially}} useful, {{because it can}} be fully automated to find uranium particles in a sample of <b>many</b> <b>million</b> particles in a matter of hours. Particles of interest can then be imaged and further analyzed with very high isotopic precision.|$|R
5|$|Scientific {{investigation}} {{has resulted in}} several culturally transformative shifts in people's view of the planet. In the West, belief in a flat Earth was displaced {{by the idea of}} spherical Earth, credited to Pythagoras in the 6th century BC. Earth was further believed {{to be the center of}} the universe until the 16th century when scientists first theorized that it was a moving object, comparable to the other planets in the Solar System. Due to the efforts of influential Christian scholars and clerics such as James Ussher, who sought to determine the age of Earth through analysis of genealogies in Scripture, Westerners before the 19th century generally believed Earth to be a few thousand years old at most. It was only during the 19th century that geologists realized Earth's age was at least <b>many</b> <b>millions</b> of years.|$|E
5|$|Sporting {{competitions}} {{have always}} provided entertainment for crowds. To distinguish the {{players from the}} audience, the latter are often known as spectators. Developments in stadium and auditorium design, {{as well as in}} recording and broadcast technology, have allowed off-site spectators to watch sport, with the result that the size of the audience has grown ever larger and spectator sport has become increasingly popular. Two of the most popular sports with global appeal are association football and cricket. Their ultimate international competitions, the World Cup and test cricket, are broadcast around the world. Beyond the very large numbers involved in playing these sports, they are notable for being a major source of entertainment for <b>many</b> <b>millions</b> of non-players worldwide. A comparable multi-stage, long-form sport with global appeal is the Tour de France, unusual in that it takes place outside of special stadia, being run instead in the countryside.|$|E

50|$|Below is a {{cladogram}} with {{extinct species}} {{in which the}} crown Catharrhini emerged within the Dendropithecidae, which emerged in the Propliopithecoidea. Also, Saadaniodiea is sister of the Cercopithecoidea rather than of the Crown Catharrhini here. It is indicated how <b>many</b> <b>million</b> years ago (Mya) the clades diverged into newer clades.|$|R
25|$|In {{irregular}} galaxies, open clusters may {{be found}} throughout the galaxy, although their concentration is highest where the gas density is highest. Open clusters are not seen in elliptical galaxies: star formation ceased <b>many</b> <b>millions</b> of years ago in ellipticals, and so the open clusters which were originally present have long since dispersed.|$|E
25|$|Since then, <b>many</b> <b>millions</b> of cavity {{magnetrons}} {{have been}} manufactured; while {{some have been}} for radar the vast majority have been for microwave ovens. The use in radar itself has dwindled to some extent, as more accurate signals have generally been needed and developers have moved to klystron and traveling-wave tube systems for these needs.|$|E
25|$|Geochronology is {{the science}} of {{determining}} the absolute age of rocks, fossils, and sediments {{by a variety of}} techniques. These methods indicate that the Earth as a whole is about 4.54 billion years old, and that the strata that, according to flood geology, were laid down during the Flood some 6,000 years ago, were actually deposited gradually over <b>many</b> <b>millions</b> of years.|$|E
50|$|MOT is {{a measure}} of how <b>many</b> <b>million</b> sperm cells per ml are highly motile, that is, {{approximately}} of grade a (>25 micrometer per 5 sek. at room temperature) and grade b (>25 micrometer per 25 sek. at room temperature). Thus, it is a combination of sperm count and motility.|$|R

25|$|The dengue viruses produce <b>many</b> <b>millions</b> of infections {{annually}} due to transmission by {{a successful}} global mosquito vector. As mosquito control has failed, several dengue vaccines are in varying stages of development. CYD-TDV, sold under the trade name Dengvaxia, is a tetravalent chimeric vaccine that splices structural genes {{of the four}} dengue viruses onto a 17D yellow fever backbone. Dengvaxia is approved in five countries.|$|E
25|$|The {{first part}} of the book {{explains}} the origin and evolution of the universe itself, in terms derived from the Hindu concept of cyclical development. The world and everything in it is said to alternate between periods of activity (manvantaras) and periods of passivity (pralayas). Each manvantara lasts <b>many</b> <b>millions</b> of years and consists of a number of Yugas, in accordance with Hindu cosmology.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} extinct volcanoes on Mars, four {{of which are}} vast shield volcanoes far bigger than any on Earth. They include Arsia Mons, Ascraeus Mons, Hecates Tholus, Olympus Mons, and Pavonis Mons. These volcanoes have been extinct for <b>many</b> <b>millions</b> of years, but the European Mars Express {{spacecraft}} has found evidence that volcanic activity may have occurred on Mars {{in the recent past}} as well.|$|E
