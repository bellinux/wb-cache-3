5|$|Planning was {{underway}} for {{the extension of}} SR75 east to the then-proposed SR125 by 1963. The California Highway Commission endorsed the routing for SR75 in 1965 along Otay Mesa Road, away from future residential developments. There were plans as early as 1970 to have a highway heading southwest to a new border crossing that would bypass the Tijuana area. The next year, James Moe, the state public works director, subsequently asked the California State Legislature to lengthen SR75 to connect to this new crossing, rather than using I-5 to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>connection.</b>|$|E

5|$|Before being {{upgraded}} to a freeway between Britannia Boulevard and Siempre Viva Road, SR905 {{had a direct}} connection with SR 125 via two at-grade intersections on Otay Mesa Road. When that segment of the SR905 freeway was opened in 2010, the interchange with SR125 had initially been omitted, forcing traffic on SR905 and SR125 to exit their respective freeways and use Otay Mesa Road (which continues to parallel SR905) to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>connection.</b> To help fix this problem, ramps from SR905 in both directions and SR11 westbound to SR125 northbound were completed on November 30, 2016, {{at a cost of}} over $21 million. Southbound traffic on SR125 must currently still exit to Otay Mesa Road at that toll road's south end in order to connect to SR905, but the southbound ramps are scheduled to begin construction in 2018.|$|E
5|$|In Flint Township, M-21 follows Corunna Road {{and meets}} I-75/US23 at exit118. The road crosses a former branch {{line of the}} Canadian National Railway (converted into a bicycle trail) east of the interchange. Corunna Road angles to the {{northeast}} near Bradley Avenue and terminates at Court Street. The trunkline turns east and follows Court over {{a tributary of the}} Flint River near Aldrich Park. Northeast of the stream, M-21 splits along a one-way pairing of Court and 5th streets. Eastbound traffic follows 5th Street past the city and county buildings in the area. The highway passes over I-475 and terminates at the east frontage road. Traffic connecting between M-21 and I-475 must use the frontage roads to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>connection.</b>|$|E
5|$|Previously, SR125 had {{a direct}} {{connection}} with SR905 via two at-grade intersections on Otay Mesa Road.

SR11 is planned to be a toll facility that will serve a new border crossing east of Otay Mesa. Ramps from SR 11 westbound and eastbound to SR 125 northbound were completed on November 30, 2016, at a cost of over $21 million.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, the California Transportation Commission (CTC) {{approved}} shifting SR 111 {{onto the}} new SR 86 expressway {{after it was}} completed, using SR 195 to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>connection.</b> When the SR 86 expressway was fully constructed, SR 195 was {{to be removed from}} the state highway system according to state law; that expressway was finished in 2001. However, this removed the connection from the highway portion of SR 111 to the new expressway carrying both SR 111 and SR 86 north from the state highway system. Caltrans officially deleted most of SR 195 in 2009, leaving a gap in SR 111 following deletions of the old routing that was now bypassed by the expressway. In December 2014, with Riverside County and Caltrans both supporting, the CTC transferred the remaining portion of SR 195, from the new SR 86 expressway to SR 111, to become part of SR 111. SR 195 still appears in Caltrans documents dated from 2014.|$|E
5|$|M-49 {{was added}} to the state highway system in 1930, running along its current routing between M-9 (now M-99) in Litchfield and the Ohio state line south of Camden. Near the state line, the highway jogged along Territorial Road for a short {{distance}} to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> with the continuation of SR49. The second version of M-120 ran concurrently with M-49 on this section of Territorial Road starting in 1939. This concurrency was removed in late 1946 or early 1947 when M-49 was realigned to smooth out the corners in the roadway at M-120. The routing of M-49 has remained the same since. It is currently the only state highway that connects with a like-numbered state highway from another state. The only other highways in Michigan to share a number with a cross-border connection are components of the Interstate Highway System or the United States Numbered Highways.|$|E
