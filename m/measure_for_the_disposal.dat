40|$|The {{notion that}} {{inadequate}} health services {{might have been}} one of <b>the</b> reasons <b>for</b> <b>the</b> fall of the Roman Empire is investigated. Despite many factors preventing the early development of an adequate public health service, the Romans had achieved much by the 5 th century AD. Apart from many laws promoting public health, various official measures were taken by <b>the</b> Roman government, <b>for</b> example <b>the</b> appointment of state physicians and free medical services <b>for</b> <b>the</b> poor. But the greatest contribution of the Romans was the provision of facilities which served as an indispensable infra-structure for public health care, such as the provision of an ample supply of pure water, public baths, advanced <b>measures</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>disposal</b> of sewage, and somewhat later under the influence of Christianity, hospitals <b>for</b> <b>the</b> general public. Although there were still deficiencies, the Roman government cannot be criticised for laxity as far as the provision of health services was concerned. Inasmuch as they were in default, it was because of lack of scientific medical knowledge which only evolved c. 1 500 years later. 1...|$|R
40|$|Law no. 59 / 1993, {{amending}} the Code of Civil Procedure, has reintroduced the referral {{in the interest}} of the law, the referral being readjusted by the provisions of article 329 of the Code of Civil Procedure, modified through the provisions of Law no. 202 / 2010 regarding <b>measures</b> <b>for</b> accelerating <b>the</b> <b>disposal</b> of <b>the</b> lawsuits. According to the Code of Civil Procedure, it is known that the referral in the interests of the law has become a legal remedy having the purpose of ensuring the unitary interpretation and implementation of the law across the Romanian territory. This subject matter needs to be given a high level of importance by both legal practitioners and theoreticians. This study is briefly covering a potential and legal approach regarding this subject matter with an emphasis on the amendments contained in the present legislation, as compared to other countries' legislation...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{solution}} to evacuation of the population from the zone of emergency planning of the nuclear power station Temelín {{in the event of}} an incident connected with the release of radioactive substances. It analyzes the way of evacuation of the persons, as one of the most important safety measures to ensure protection of the population. In particular, the work focuses on the correct procedures in the case of realization of the evacuation and competence of the persons involved in safety measures. It lists the basic criteria which are applied in protection of the population from the effects of ionizing radiation in vicinity of nuclear power plants. It proposes improving of quality of security protection and information of persons in the zone of emergency planning. The work is based on valid law regulations and special publications of the examined problems. The predominantly part is based on the laws in force, and expertise of publications covering the evacuation of the area. It refers to the external emergency plan, as <b>the</b> basic document <b>for</b> <b>the</b> planning of <b>measures</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>disposal</b> of <b>the</b> consequences of radiation accidents or radiation accidents and the limitation of their consequences <b>for</b> <b>the</b> zone of emergency planning. The theoretical part proceeeds from analysis of contemporary legislation concerning the stated problematics, presents the general characteristics of a nuclear device and zone of emergency planning, defining the basic concepts and discusses the important measures in addressing emergencies arising in connection with radiation accidents in nuclear power plant. The work puts emphasis on the principle of correct behaviour of the population in the event of such an accident. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> processing of the thesis there has been used an exploration method, which is based on the proposed methodology. On the base of analysis of survey, possible ways of improvement of this branch were suggested. From the collected data there have been assessed possible system measures of evacuation with regard to their application in practice...|$|R
