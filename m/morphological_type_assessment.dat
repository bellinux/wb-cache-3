40|$|The Tully-Fisher {{relation}} of spiral galaxies shows notable dependence on <b>morphological</b> <b>types,</b> with earlier type spirals having systematically lower luminosity at fixed maximum rotation velocity $V_{max}$. This decrement of luminosity is more significant in shorter wavelengths. By modeling the rotation curve and stellar population of different <b>morphological</b> <b>type</b> spiral galaxies in combination, {{we find the}} $V_{max}$ of spiral galaxies is weakly dependent on the <b>morphological</b> <b>type,</b> whereas the difference of the stellar population originating from the bulge disk composition effect mainly account for the <b>morphological</b> <b>type</b> dependence of the Tully-Fisher relation.

40|$|Results of a {{study of}} galaxy {{morphology}} in a homogeneous sample of 98 compact groups of galaxies are reported. Of all the galaxies, 49 percent are of late <b>morphological</b> <b>type</b> (S + Irr), somewhat less than the corresponding fraction for field galaxies. Similarly, for first-ranked galaxies only, 48 percent are late type. Several strong correlations are found between galaxy type and the galaxy environment. Morphological concordance occurs between galaxies within a group. Galaxy <b>morphological</b> <b>type</b> correlates with group optical luminosity, and galaxy morphology correlates with velocity dispersion. The latter correlation {{is found to be}} the more fundamental of the two. No strong correlation between <b>morphological</b> <b>type</b> and galaxy space density is found in these compact groups, contrary to the situation in rich clusters and loose groups.

It has been established that the galaxy morphology strongly depends on the environment in which the galaxy resides (e. g., Dressler 1980). Galaxy pairs correspond to the smallest scales of galaxy clustering and may provide important clues to how the environment influences the formation and evolution of galaxies.

40|$|We {{determine}} the <b>morphological</b> <b>types</b> of 2295 galaxies from the ESO Nearby Abell Cluster Survey (ENACS) from CCD images obtained with the Dutch telescope on La Silla. A comparison with <b>morphological</b> <b>types</b> {{from the literature}} for 450 of our galaxies shows that the reliability of our classification is quite {{comparable to that of}} other classifiers. We recalibrate the ENACS spectral classification with the new <b>morphological</b> <b>types,</b> and find that early- and late-type galaxies can be distinguished from their spectra with 83 % reliability. Ellipticals and S 0 galaxies can hardly be distinguished {{on the basis of their}} spectra, but late spirals can be classified from the spectrum alone with more than 70 % reliability. We derive pseudo-colors and linestrengths from the ENACS spectra for the galaxies of different <b>morphological</b> <b>types.</b> We consider the bright (MR ≤ − 20) and faint (MR> − 20) subsets of the galaxies without emission lines (non-ELG) separately. We find a strong and significant correlation between the average color and the average strength of the metal absorption lines. The average metallicity decreases and the average color gets bluer towards later Hubble type. Also, the faint galaxies in each morphological class are bluer and less metal-rich than their brighter counterparts, which extends the well-established color-magnitude relation of early-type galaxies to (late) spirals. In view of these very strong global trends, the colors and metallicities of faint S 0 galaxies and bright early spirals are remarkably similar. The bright early spirals may, on average, have somewhat stronger Hδ absorption than the other galaxies, which could be due to recent starformation. The galaxies with emission lines (ELG) have a bluer spectral continuum than the non-ELG, and the amount of blueing hardly depends on <b>morphological</b> <b>type.</b> The fraction of ELG depends strongly on <b>morphological</b> <b>type</b> (varying from 4 ± 1 % for ellipticals to 59 ± 4 % for lat...|$|R

40|$|An {{observational}} {{evidence for}} the tidal shear effect of the large-scale structure on the galaxy <b>morphological</b> <b>type</b> is presented. By analyzing a sample of 15, 882 well-resolved nearby galaxies from the Tully Catalog and the real space tidal field reconstructed from the 2 Mass Redshift Survey (2 MRS), we investigate the dependence of galaxy <b>morphological</b> <b>type</b> on the shear of large-scale environment. We first divide the Tully galaxies into six subsamples according to their <b>morphological</b> <b>types.</b> Then, we calculate the density (δ), ellipticity (e), prolateness (p), and Q-factor of the regions where the subsample galaxies are located by interpolating the 2 MRS tidal shear field. Here, the Q-factor differentiates among a void-like (Q = − 1), a sheet-like (Q = − 1 / 3), a filament-like (Q = 1 / 3), and a halo-like (Q = 1) environment. Averaging the four quantities over the six subsamples separately, we show how the mean values of δ, e, p and Q change with the six subsamples. It is found that there exist systematic changes of 〈e〉, 〈p 〉 and 〈Q〉 with galaxy <b>morphological</b> <b>type.</b> We also calculate the conditional number densities of the subsample galaxies located in the void-like, sheet-like, filament-like, and halo-lik...|$|R
