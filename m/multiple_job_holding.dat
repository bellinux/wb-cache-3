The programme has two linked research objectives- (i) creating a quantitative {{profile of the}} incidence of <b>multiple</b> <b>job</b> <b>holding</b> in New Zealand; and (ii) investigating the dynamics of becoming a multiple job holder in New Zealand and the social consequences of <b>multiple</b> <b>job</b> <b>holding.</b> Organised around these two objectives, this programme of social research is investigating the role of <b>multiple</b> <b>job</b> <b>holding</b> as a positive change strategy for individuals, families and communities. It focuses particularly on factors that influence the adoption of <b>multiple</b> <b>job</b> <b>holding</b> by individuals, and the effects that a <b>multiple</b> <b>job</b> <b>holding</b> workstyle has on individuals, families and communities.

Higher education nearly doubles this probability.

40|$|<b>Multiple</b> <b>job</b> <b>holding</b> is a {{significant}} feature of the contemporary New Zealand labour market, {{with at least one}} in ten people actively involved in the workforce holding more than one job at a time. Research into the effects of <b>multiple</b> <b>job</b> <b>holding</b> on the lives of workers in three sectors shows there can be considerable impact on their work-life balance. The researchers conducted in-depth interviews with male and female health professionals. farmers. and caje or restaurant workers.

However, this occurred within a context of growing inequality as indicated by a segmented labour market between standard and non-standard employment.

Of importance, the study finds that resources are an essential factor when considering how whānau cope.

The research is based on structured face-to-face interviews with 73 people aged 18 - 34 years who worked in café/restaurant and/or creative occupations. Young people working in either occupational group were ambivalent about why they held multiple jobs: they reported wanting to work in this way and also having to, for financial and other reasons. However, whereas those in café/restaurant jobs often saw <b>multiple</b> <b>job</b> <b>holding</b> as a transitional work arrangement to support themselves and their lifestyle while they pursued other activities, those in creative occupations tended to view <b>multiple</b> <b>job</b> <b>holding</b> as a long-term working arrangement. Despite the negative impacts <b>multiple</b> <b>job</b> <b>holding</b> had on many aspects of their personal and social life, most young people described <b>multiple</b> <b>job</b> <b>holding</b> overall as a positive experience.

40|$|Essays in this {{dissertation}} address three research questions. (1) What {{types of}} persons hold dual jobs {{and what are}} their motives for doing so? In essay 1, I investigate multiple factors that affect the decision to hold {{more than a single}} job. Using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS), the first essay documents the characteristics of second jobs and multiple job holders in the U. S. I characterize the types of people who hold dual jobs and use additional information from the BLS to find out workers’ motives for holding multiple jobs. I examine how <b>multiple</b> <b>job</b> <b>holding</b> differs with respect to age, education, race and ethnicity, sex, foreign-born status, marital status, public-private worker status, broad industry and occupation. (2) How does dual job holding vary with the business cycle and state of the labor market? Essay 2 explores a large micro data set for 1998 - 2013 that covers most U. S. urban labor markets. We find clear-cut evidence that <b>multiple</b> <b>job</b> <b>holding</b> across labor markets and over time is weakly cyclical, thus (slightly) exacerbating rather than mitigating the severity of business cycles. Much of the cyclicality in <b>multiple</b> <b>job</b> <b>holding</b> seen across labor markets, however, is not causal, dropping sharply after accounting for MSA fixed effects. Using longitudinal worker data, there is minimal response to unemployment changes within labor markets over time. Our large CPS sample size produces precise estimates, albeit ones close to zero, helping explain conflicting results in prior studies based on far smaller data sets. (3) How might one explain the persistent geographical differences in <b>multiple</b> <b>job</b> <b>holding?</b> Essay 3 documents what are systematic (i. e., long-run) differences in <b>multiple</b> <b>job</b> <b>holding</b> across labor markets (MSAs) and explores possible explanations for these differences. Geographical differences in <b>multiple</b> <b>job</b> <b>holding</b> rates have received little attention, although the <b>multiple</b> <b>job</b> <b>holding</b> rates in some regions of the country are substantially higher than in other regions, and these differences have been persistent over time. Examining correlates of these labor market differences in <b>multiple</b> <b>job</b> <b>holding</b> provides us with {{a better understanding of the}} determinants of labor supply and how local labor markets work...|$|E

(2014), and Panos et al. (2014).

30|$|In {{measuring}} labor {{supply for}} <b>multiple</b> <b>jobs,</b> we observe whether workers <b>hold</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>jobs,</b> {{but do not}} observe whether workers with a single job seek a second job. Hence, one cannot directly observe the labor supply for <b>multiple</b> <b>jobs</b> (conditional on the wage) absent the unrealistic assumption of market clearing. And it makes little sense to assume that markets clear if one is studying employment over the business cycle. Hence, our empirical work can identify the relationship between MJH and the business cycle, but the observed relationship reflects labor demand and job opportunities as well as labor supply preferences. Even if labor supply for <b>multiple</b> <b>jobs</b> is countercyclical, this need not result in increased MJH during a recession. That said, we provide supplementary evidence showing that among married couples, income shocks from changes in husbands’ employment affects wives’ MJH status. We see minimal response in husbands’ MJH behavior following changes in wives’ labor force status.|$|R
