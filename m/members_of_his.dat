5|$|After {{finishing}} his schooling Kagame made two visits to Rwanda, in 1977 and 1978. He was initially hosted by family <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> former classmates, but upon arrival in Kigali he {{made contact with}} <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own family. He kept a low profile on these visits, believing that {{his status as a}} well-connected Tutsi exile could lead to arrest; on his second visit he entered the country through Zaire rather than Uganda to avoid suspicion. Kagame used his time in Rwanda to explore the country, familiarise himself with the political and social situation, and make connections that would prove useful to him in his later activities.|$|E

After Jesus' death, many <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> family joined the Christian movement. Jesus' brother James became a leader of the Jerusalem Church.|$|E

5|$|Although Chaplin {{remained}} {{politically active}} {{in the years following}} the failure of Monsieur Verdoux, his next film, about a forgotten vaudeville comedian and a young ballerina in Edwardian London, was devoid of political themes.
