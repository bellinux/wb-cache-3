40|$|Global {{population}} growth requires intensification of agriculture, {{for which a}} sustainable supply of phosphorus (P) is essential. Since natural P reserves are diminishing, recovering P from wastes and residues is an increasingly attractive prospect, particularly as technical and economic potential in the area is growing. In addition to providing phosphorus for agricultural use, precipitation of P from waste residues and effluents lessens their nutrient loading prior to disposal. This paper critically reviews published methods for P recovery from waste streams (<b>municipal,</b> <b>farm</b> and industrial) with emphasis on struvite (MgNH 4 PO 46 H 2 O) crystallisation, including pre-treatments to maximise recovery. Based on compositional parameters {{of a range of}} wastes, a Feedstock Suitability Index (FSI) was developed as a guide to inform researchers and operators of the relative potential for struvite production from each waste...|$|E
40|$|There {{is growing}} public concern in Zimbabwe over the illegal {{cultivation}} of vegetables on soils amended with sewage sludge or irrigated with admixtures of sewage and sewage sludge. Excessive accumulation of heavy metals in agricultural soils may not only result in environmental contamination, but lead to elevated heavy metal uptake by crops, which may affect food quality and safety. The work reported here studied heavy metal concentrations in crops irrigated with sewage sludge and sewage/sewage sludge admixtures at Firle <b>Municipal</b> <b>Farm</b> in Harare. The crops analysed {{in this study}} are heavily contaminated with the four regulated elements Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn. This contamination is at its highest in two of the staple dietary crops maize and tsunga. Tsunga leaves contained 3. 68 mg kg- 1 Cd, over 18 times the permissible level by the EU standards (0. 2 mg kg- 1); Cu concentrations were 111 mg kg- 1, 5 times the EU Standard (20 mg kg- 1); concentrations of Pb were 6. 77 mg kg- 1, over 22 times the permissible levels allowed by both EU standards and UK guidelines (0. 3 mg kg- 1); Zn concentrations were 221 mg kg- 1, over 4 times the guideline value (50 mg kg- 1). The other plants (beans, maize, peppers and sugarcane) also contained concentrations of heavy metals above the permissible levels. Furthermore the concentrations observed in this study were higher than those reported by other workers who have examined vegetation from other contaminated sites. This study highlights the potential risks involved in the cultivation and consumption of vegetables on plots irrigated with sewage sludge, a practice which may place at risk the health of the urban population who consume these vegetables...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effectiveness of wood residues in the removal of nutrients (ammonium-N; NH 4 -N) from nutrient-rich (NH 4 -N) waters. The water holding capacity of the wood materials was also determined. Carried out at Rothamsted Research, North Wyke, UK, this controlled laboratory experiment tested two wood residues; in length, one being 1 - 2 cm and the other from 150 µm (microns) to 9. 5 mm. Although a wide range of studies have shown the effectiveness and performance of various absorbent materials as animal beddings, such as straw (cereal straw), woodchip (sawdust, bark or wood shavings), bracken and rushes, only few have focused on the NH 4 -N sorption/desorption capacity. The depuration capacity of wood residues from nutrient-rich effluents such as those from cattle bedded on woodchip or straw will be controlled by processes such as sorption (adsorption-absorption) and desorption of nutrients. Studies have reported the nitrogen removal capacity of woodchip materials and biochar from woodchip as well as removal of NH 4 +-N from domestic and <b>municipal</b> wastewater, <b>farm</b> dirty water, landfill and industry effluents. These studies have observed that the mechanism of removal of nitrogen is by either increasing NO 3 [...] N removal form leachate by enhancing N 2 O losses via denitrification (biochar as carbon source for denitrifiers) or by decreasing NH 4 +-N in leachate through adsorption to negatively charged sites. Results showed that although the cation exchange capacity (CEC) and surface area (SA) are both fundamental properties of adsorbent materials, no correlation was found with CEC and adsorption or desorption. Nor did changes in pH appear to be sufficiently important to cause changes in CEC. For this reason, osmotic pressure appeared to be a more predominant parameter controlling processes of adsorption and desorption of NH 4 +-N in both wood residues. Thus, wood residues high in NH 4 +-N should be avoided, as they could have an opposite effect in the adsorption of nutrients from nutrient-rich effluents. The results also showed that some wood residues (G 30) had great capacity to adsorb NH 4 +-N to levels up to nearly 90...|$|R

5000|$|This was {{the reason}} that {{despite a lack of}} schooling, {{straight}} after his confirmation, Augustinussen was employed as the communal school teacher by pastor Krogh. The communal school was meant to be preparation for regular school, where children would learn [...] "how to read" [...] and [...] "the understanding of words". From 1826 he was also a home tutor for pastor Krogh's children. Here he was given access to Krogh's relatively rich library. The regular school in Nesna was built in 1823, 37 years before the common school law of 1860 demanded that schools of more than 30 pupils needed their own school building. It was tradition that the curate was the teacher there. Peter Eggen was finally suspended from his position as curate in 1829 and died the same year. When the curate position became available, Augustinussen was appointed in 1830, at the young age of 22.

30|$|Historically, {{humans were}} resided around {{the rivers and}} {{following}} this, cities, agriculture and industries were developed near the rivers. Rivers {{are one of the}} most vital sources for water supplying for humans (Sánchez et al. 2007; Simeonov et al. 2003). Parallel to population growth, the water demand has been increased. Furthermore, due to increase in agricultural and industrial activities and water pollution, the available water resources have been limited. Therefore, management and quality control of water resources is necessary (Fataei 2012). Karoon River is the longest river in Iran that supplies 70 % of drinking water of Khuzestan Province. This river is contaminated with different wastewaters, and any interruption in its disinfection will lead to contamination and infection in peoples. Presently, high volume of agricultural drainages and industrial, aquaculture and municipal wastewaters are discharged to this river, which reduces the water quality, especially in low-rain seasons (Madadi Nia et al. 2014). Heavy metals and antibiotics are important contaminants that are introduced with these wastewaters into Karoon River (Audi 1994; Mara and Horan 2003). Heavy metals can be accumulated in food chain, and hence this leads to human toxicity. In addition, these contaminants will lead to the selection of heavy metal-resistant microorganisms that are health hazards for humans and animals (Johnson et al. 2007). Antibiotics are routinely used for treatment of bacterial infections in medicine as well as veterinary medicine. <b>Municipal,</b> hospital, animal <b>farms</b> and aquaculture wastewaters are the main sources of antibiotics that are directly introduced into Karoon River and consequently will increase antibiotic-resistant microorganisms in environment. Such microorganisms can cause infections that are resistant to treatment or during horizontal gene transfer, will donate resistance genes to pathogenic bacteria, and hence this can cause even life-threatening infections (Kümmerer 2004; Rahube and Yost 2010). With regard to this fact, frequent monitoring of the Karoon River water quality is vital for prevention of the undesirable outcomes of water contamination. The aim of the present study was to investigate water quality of Karoon River in different seasons and determine the antibiotic resistance profile of bacterial isolates. These data are useful guidelines for control and prevention of infectious disease epidemics and restriction of the distribution of antibiotic resistance among bacterial species.|$|R

This makes the task of the valuer complex, and it increases the possibility of large differences in the estimated market value determined and the actual selling price. The development and use of AVM (Automated Valuation Method) models in the valuation of especially residential property, is a worldwide phenomenon. The majority of AVM models use MRA (Multiple Regression Analysis) as a basis. The accuracy of a MRA relies heavily on the quality and accuracy of the data that are used. Thus, the availability of quality and accurate data has {{a significant impact on the}} potential accuracy of a MRA. Accurate MRA valuation estimates will be fair to individual farm owners regarding their municipal tax assessments and it will lead to a wider use of MRAs for the valuation of farms, with the associated benefits of lower valuation costs and speedier valuations, especially by financial institutions. This study analyses the unique and distinctive attributes of farms, which must be taken into account when a MRA model is developed. By following a stepwise regression approach, a regression model is developed which is fairly accurate, but it does not achieve a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, the results of the study show that it is difficult to have enough appropriate and accurate data available to develop a regression analysis for agricultural property to satisfy accuracy requirements. Although it is difficult, it is possible to develop MRA models that are fairly accurate. Therefore, if MRA models are currently used for the <b>municipal</b> valuation of <b>farms,</b> which are not fairly accurate, it should be possible to improve the accuracy. However, maximum accuracy cannot be achieved with MRA models. Thus, it cannot replace a valuation done by a skilled and knowledgeable professional valuer, when maximum accuracy is required.

40|$|Os fragmentos naturais de florestas inundáveis conhecidos como ipucas localizam-se na planície do Araguaia, sob a forma de depressões naturais, que no Estado do Tocantins estão situados em áreas de planícies de inundação, que favorece seu alagamento e, conseqüentemente, o maior tempo de retenção da água em épocas de elevada precipitação. O presente estudo foi desenvolvido na fazenda Lago Verde, Município de Lagoa da Confusão, Tocantins, situado entre as coordenadas UTM: 643586 e 644060 leste e 8792795 e 8799167 norte. O objetivo do trabalho foi caracterizar a estrutura de um fragmento de floresta inundável de aproximadamente um hectare, inserido em área de orizicultura irrigada. Para o levantamento fitossociológico, foram amostrados todos os indivíduos arbustivo-arbóreos com perímetro a 1, 30 m do solo (PAP) > 15 cm. Ao todo, foram encontrados 807 indivíduos, 35 famílias e 70 espécies. As espécies com maior VC, em ordem decrescente, foram Hirtella racemosa Lam., Qualea multiflora Mart. e Cecropia pachystachya Trécul. As famílias mais ricas em espécies foram Fabaceae (9), Vochysiaceae (6), Annonaceae e Malvaceae (4). O índice de diversidade de Shannon (H') foi de 3, 44. A distribuição de classes de diâmetro apresentou curva na forma de "J" invertido, estando a maioria dos indivíduos na primeira classe. The natural {{fragments}} of floodplain forests known as "ipucas" {{are located in}} the Araguaia plain, in form of natural depressions, which are located in areas of floodplains in the State of Tocantins, favoring its flooding and, consequently, the largest period of water retention during periods of high precipitation. The present study was developed at Lagoa Verde <b>farm,</b> <b>municipal</b> district of Lagoa da Confusão, Tocantins between the coordinates UTM: 643586 and 644060 east and 8792795 and 8799167 north. The objective of the work was to characterize the structure of a floodplain forest fragment of approximately one-hectare area, inserted in area of irrigated rice cultivation. For the phytosociological survey, all the tree/shrub individuals with perimeter at 1. 30 m (PBH) > 15 cm were sampled. On the whole, 807 individuals, 35 families and 70 species were sampled. The species with higher VC, in descending order, were Hirtella racemosa Lam., Qualea multiflora Mart. and Cecropia pachystachya Trécul. The richest families in species were Fabaceae (9), Vochysiaceae (6), Annonaceae and Malvaceae (4). The Shannon diversity index (H') was 3. 44. The distribution of diameter classes showed an inverted "J" curve, with most of the individuals being in the first class...|$|R
40|$|Pressures on {{the natural}} resources, {{especially}} land and water, continue to increase {{as a result of}} an ever-increasing world population and continuing economic growth. These pressures originate from the many claims of stakeholders at different scales on the limited resources, and are aggravated by their different and often conflicting goals. Discussions on alternative resource uses, prioritizing different goals, and formulation and implementation of land use policies would greatly benefit from a quantitative assessment of the economic, social and environmental benefits and costs associated with the alternatives. In this study, a multi-scale and model-based approach was developed and applied in support of joint-learning, policy discussions and decision-making with respect to agricultural land use. The methodology was operationalized, in consultation with stakeholders, for the province of Ilocos Norte in the northwest of the Philippines, and its most populous municipality, Batac.  Six optimization models with different specifications were developed for different spatial scales: one for the farm, four for the municipal and one for the provincial scale. Results of the farm household analysis show the comparative attractiveness of alternative agricultural technologies, although adoption behaviour with respect to these technologies is different for poor, average and better-off households. The provincial analysis provides a quantitative assessment of the trade-off involved in prioritizing economic goals over social goals of food self-sufficiency and increased employment in agriculture. Results of the municipal analysis show that limited markets, inadequate infrastructure and resource endowments of farm households strongly affect resource use and goal achievement in Batac. As the effects of these factors in the model are significant, ignoring them may result in misleading simulation results and, hence, policy conclusions. The multi-scale approach was used to quantify the effects of agricultural policies pertaining to attainment of food self-sufficiency goals, liberalization of rice prices, infrastructure improvements and volumetric water pricing on income, food production, resource use, and environmental indicators at the <b>farm,</b> <b>municipal</b> and provincial scales. Food self-sufficiency goals can be achieved but conflict with economic objectives. Liberalization of rice prices results in lower income for farmers but benefits rice consumers as a result of lower rice prices. Irrigation improvements can contribute to increased rice production, however, at the expense of income. Similarly, volumetric water pricing can result in more efficient water use at the <b>farm</b> and <b>municipal</b> scale, but at the expense of income in the short-run. Many of these results seem trivial, but the model-based analyses result in quantitative estimates for the effects on the economic, agricultural and environmental dimensions of the problem. It is anticipated that model-based analyses has a potential to play a key role in participatory land use policy formulation. Results from the multi-scale approach presented in this thesis can provide valuable information for policy development and assessment. This may enhance transparent discussions among stakeholders on the implications of various objectives and priorities at different scales for resource use. This also allows ex-ante analysis of agricultural and natural resource use policies, including assessment of the potentials of new agro-technologies.
