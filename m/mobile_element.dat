This raises potential problems to reconstruct their history. Here, we combine phylogenetic and genomic context analyses {{to study the}} evolution of the replicative minichromosome maintenance (MCM) helicases in Archaea. Several archaeal genomes encode more than one copy of the mcm gene. Genome context analysis reveals that most of these additional copies are encoded within <b>mobile</b> <b>elements.</b> Exhaustive analysis of these elements reveals diverse groups of integrated archaeal plasmids or viruses, including several head-and-tail proviruses. Some MCMs encoded by <b>mobile</b> <b>elements</b> are structurally distinct from their cellular counterparts, with one case of novel domain organization. Both genome context and phylogenetic analysis indicate that MCM encoded by <b>mobile</b> <b>elements</b> were recruited from cellular genomes. An accelerated evolution and a dramatic expansion of methanococcal MCMs suggest a host-to-virus-to-host transfer loop, possibly triggered by the loss of the archaeal initiator protein Cdc 6 in Methanococcales. Surprisingly, despite extensive transfer of mcm genes between viruses, plasmids, and cells, the topology of the MCM tree is strikingly congruent with the consensus archaeal phylogeny, indicating that <b>mobile</b> <b>elements</b> encoding mcm have coevolved with their hosts and that DNA replication proteins can be also useful to reconstruct the history of the archaeal domain...|$|R

5000|$|Somatic {{mutation}} {{leading to}} mosaicism is {{prevalent in the}} beginning and end stages of human life. [...] Somatic mosaics are common in embryogenesis due to retrotransposition of L1 and Alu transposable elements. In early development, DNA from undifferentiated cell types may be more susceptible to <b>mobile</b> <b>element</b> invasion due to long, un-methylated regions in the genome. [...] Further, the accumulation of DNA copy errors and damage over a lifetime lead to greater occurrences of mosaic tissues in aging humans. As our longevity has increased dramatically over the last century, our genome may not have had time to adapt to cumulative effects of mutagenesis. Thus, cancer research has shown that somatic mutations are increasingly present throughout a lifetime and are responsible for most leukemia, lymphomas, and solid tumors.|$|E
50|$|Sub-microscopic {{structural}} variants {{are much}} harder to detect owing to their small size. The first study in 2004 that used DNA microarrays could detect tens of genetic loci that exhibited copy number variation, deletions and duplications, greater than 100 kilobases in the human genome. However, by 2015 whole genome sequencing studies could detect around 5,000 of structural variants as small as 100 base pairs encompassing approximately 20 megabases in each individual genome. These structural variants include deletions, tandem duplications, inversions, <b>mobile</b> <b>element</b> insertions. The mutation rate is also much higher than microscopic structural variants, estimated by two studies at 16% and 20% respectively, {{both of which are}} probably underestimates due to the challenges of accurately detecting structural variants.

We investigate the possibility that molecular machineries of disparate <b>mobile</b> <b>elements</b> may functionally interact, using the example of a retrotransposon, {{in the form of a}} mobile group II intron, found on a conjugative plasmid pRS 01 in Lactococcus lactis. This intron resides within the pRS 01 ltrB gene encoding relaxase, the enzyme required for nicking the transfer origin (oriT) for conjugal transmission of the plasmid into a recipient cell. Here, we show that relaxase stimulates both the frequency and diversity of retrotransposition events using a retromobility indicator gene (RIG), and by developing a high-throughput genomic retrotransposition detection system called RIG-Seq. We demonstrate that LtrB relaxase not only nicks ssDNA of its cognate oriT in a sequence- and strand-specific manner, but also possesses weak off-target activity. Together, the data support a model in which the two different <b>mobile</b> <b>elements,</b> one using an RNA-based mechanism, the other using DNA-based transfer, do functionally interact. Intron splicing facilitates relaxase expression required for conjugation, whereas relaxase introduces spurious nicks in recipient DNA that stimulate both the frequency of intron mobility and the density of events.

40|$|Abstract—The {{introduction}} of <b>mobile</b> <b>elements</b> in {{wireless sensor networks}} creates {{a new dimension to}} reduce and balance the energy consumption for resource-constrained sensor nodes; however, it also introduces extra latency in the data collection process due to the limited mobility of <b>mobile</b> <b>elements.</b> Therefore, how to arrange and schedule the movement of <b>mobile</b> <b>elements</b> throughout the sensing field is of ultimate importance. In this paper, the online scenario where data collection requests arrive progressively is investigated, and the data collection process is modeled as an M/G/ 1 /c–NJN queuing system, where NJN stands for nearest-job-next, a simple and intuitive service dis-cipline. Based on this model, the performance of data collection is evaluated through both theoretical analysis and extensive simulation. The NJN discipline is further extended by considering the possibility of requests combination (NJNC). The simulation results validate our analytical models and give more insights when comparing with the first-come-first-serve (FCFS) discipline. In contrast to the conventional wisdom of the starvation problem, we reveal that NJN and NJNC have a better performance than FCFS, in both the average and more importantly the worst cases, which gives the much needed assurance to adopt NJN and NJNC in the design of more sophisticated data collection schemes for <b>mobile</b> <b>elements</b> in wireless ad hoc sensor networks, as well as many other similar scheduling application scenarios.

40|$|Abstract — Several {{studies in}} recent years have {{considered}} the use of mobile elements for data gathering in wireless sensor networks, so as to reduce the need for multi-hop forwarding among the sensor nodes and thereby prolong the network lifetime. Since, typically, practical constraints preclude a <b>mobile</b> <b>element</b> from visiting all nodes in the sensor network, the solution must involve a combination of a <b>mobile</b> <b>element</b> visiting a subset of the nodes (cache points), while other nodes communicate their data to the cache points wirelessly. This leads to the optimization problem of minimizing the communication distance of the sensor nodes, while keeping the tour length of the <b>mobile</b> <b>element</b> below a given constraint. Several algorithms in existing literature have tackled this problem by separating the construction of the <b>mobile</b> <b>element</b> tour from the computation of the forwarding trees to the cache points. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that alternates between these phases and iteratively improves the outcome of each phase, based on the result of the other. We compare the resulting performance of our algorithm with that of previous work, and show that it closes a considerable portion of the gap from the theoretical optimal solution.

40|$|International audienceBackground: Diverse transposable {{elements}} are abundant in genomes of cellular organisms {{from all three}} domains of life. Although transposons are often regarded as junk DNA, {{a growing body of}} evidence indicates that they are behind some of the major evolutionary innovations. With the growth in the number and diversity of sequenced genomes, previously unnoticed <b>mobile</b> <b>elements</b> continue to be discovered. Results: We describe a new superfamily of archaeal and bacterial <b>mobile</b> <b>elements</b> which we denote casposons because they encode Cas 1 endonuclease, a key enzyme of the CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity systems of archaea and bacteria. The casposons share several features with self-synthesizing eukaryotic DNA transposons of the Polinton/Maverick class, including terminal inverted repeats and genes for B family DNA polymerases. However, unlike any other known <b>mobile</b> <b>elements,</b> the casposons are predicted to rely on Cas 1 for integration and excision, via a mechanism similar to the integration of new spacers into CRISPR loci. We identify three distinct families of casposons that differ in their gene repertoires and evolutionary provenance of the DNA polymerases. Deep branching of the casposon-encoded endonuclease in the Cas 1 phylogeny suggests that casposons played a pivotal role in the emergence of CRISPR-Cas immunity. Conclusions: The casposons are a novel superfamily of <b>mobile</b> <b>elements,</b> the first family of putative self-synthesizing transposons discovered in prokaryotes. The likely contribution of capsosons to the evolution of CRISPR-Cas parallels the involvement of the RAG 1 transposase in vertebrate immunoglobulin gene rearrangement, suggesting that recruitment of endonucleases from <b>mobile</b> <b>elements</b> as ready-made tools for genome manipulation is a general route of evolution of adaptive immunity...|$|R
