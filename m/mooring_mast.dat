5|$|In 1907, John Clark Udall oversaw {{construction}} of a north wing, {{increasing the number of}} rooms to 150. In 1909, Udall oversaw a 72-room seven-story west wing, further increasing the rooms to 221. In Germany, it was advertised in January 1909 that the management of the Briarcliff Lodge and its architect Guy King planned to construct the platform to launch and dock airships, to cost $100,000. The platform would extend over the whole roof, and the tracks for the airship launch would be on an incline 105 meters long. The plans also included the purchase of a searchlight to guide the airships. A <b>mooring</b> <b>mast</b> for docking airships was constructed on top of the west wing, however no record exists of it having been used. The <b>mooring</b> <b>mast</b> nonetheless was the first built for docking airships.|$|E

Contrary to popular belief, the Hindenburg had flown an entire year of successful voyages before it caught on fire. Questions and controversy surround the accident to this day: theories for the sudden burst of flames include sabotage against the German Nazis, static buildup, and flammable fabric.|$|E

25|$|The Michigan Central Railway Tunnel between Detroit and Canada {{opened in}} 1910 {{followed}} by a rushed opening of the Michigan Central Station in 1913 after a fire at the previous station, the first train to depart from the new station terminated in Bay City, Michigan. The New York State Barge Canal opened in 1918 offering an improved route to the Eastern seaboard compared to the Erie Canal. The Ford Airport (Dearborn) opened in 1924, which added an airship <b>mooring</b> <b>mast</b> in the following year. The Ford River Rouge Complex was completed in 1928, by which time {{it was the largest}} integrated factory with some 100,000 employees during the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|Afterward, {{work on the}} building's {{interior}} and crowning mast commenced. The <b>mooring</b> <b>mast</b> topped out on November 21, {{two months after the}} steelwork had been completed. Meanwhile, work on the walls and interior was progressing at a quick pace, with exterior walls built up to the 75th floor by the time steelwork had been built to the 95th floor. The majority of the facade was already finished by the middle of November. Because of the building's height, it was deemed infeasible to have many elevators or large elevator cabins, so the builders contracted with the Otis Elevator Company to make 66 cars that could speed at , which represented the largest-ever elevator order at the time.|$|E
25|$|No.9r {{was then}} sent to the RNAS airship station at Howden in the East Riding of Yorkshire where it {{spent most of the}} time being used for {{experimental}} mooring and handling tests. From 17 October 1917 to June 1918 it was stationed at RNAS Pulham in Norfolk where it was finally dismantled due to demand for shed space to allow construction of newer airships, having spent 198 hours and 16 minutes in the air, of which some 33 hours were at a <b>mooring</b> <b>mast.</b> Although unable to compete against contemporary Zeppelins, No.9r provided valuable experience of handling a rigid airship and the use of mooring masts, which would evolve into a unique method of mooring airships.|$|E

At one time, it was used in the construction of houses, but people are finding it more difficult to find suitable trees for that purpose.|$|R
5000|$|The US Army {{believed}} that the project's technical data and computer software could be useful for future projects but that selling it would save money. Hybrid Air Vehicles {{expressed an interest in}} purchasing the airship, saying they wanted to use it for cold-weather flights and other testing for the development of their proposed [...] "Airlander 50" [...] 50-ton cargo airship. The HAV offer included the basic avionics, <b>mooring</b> <b>masts</b> and spare engines but not the specialist equipment or helium. With this the only offer on the table, in September 2013 the Pentagon sold the LEMV airship back to HAV for $301,000.|$|R
25|$|On 2 September 1925, Shenandoah {{departed}} Lakehurst on {{a promotional}} {{flight to the}} Midwest that would include flyovers of 40 cities and visits to state fairs. Testing of a new <b>mooring</b> <b>mast</b> at Dearborn, Michigan, {{was included in the}} schedule. While passing through an area of thunderstorms and turbulence over Ohio early in the morning of 3 September, during its 57th flight, the airship was caught in a violent updraft that carried it beyond the pressure limits of its gas bags. It was torn apart in the turbulence and crashed in several pieces near Caldwell, Ohio. Fourteen crew members, including Commander Zachary Lansdowne, were killed. This included every member of the crew of the control cabin (except for Lieutenant Anderson, who escaped before it detached from the ship); two men who fell through holes in the hull; and several mechanics who fell with the engines. There were twenty-nine survivors, who succeeded in riding three sections of the airship to earth. The largest group was eighteen men who made it out of the stern after it rolled into a valley. Four others survived a crash landing of the central section. The remaining seven were in the bow section which Commander (later Vice Admiral) Charles E. Rosendahl navigated as a free balloon. In this group was Anderson who—until he was roped in by the others—straddled the catwalk over a hole.|$|E
500|$|After {{they took}} off, they headed towards Barber's Point at the {{southwest}} tip of Oahu, and initially saw an unarmed group of American B-17 Flying Fortress bombers arriving {{from the mainland}} United States. They soon arrived at Ewa <b>Mooring</b> <b>Mast</b> Field, which was being strafed by at least 12 Aichi D3A [...] "Val" [...] dive bombers of the second Japanese attack wave after expending their bomb ordnance at Pearl Harbor. Although the two pilots were outnumbered six-to-one, they immediately began firing on the dive bombers. Taylor shot down two dive bombers {{and was able to}} damage another (the third damaged aircraft was considered Taylor's first probable kill). When both pilots ran out of ammunition, they headed for Wheeler Field to get additional [...]50 cal ammunition, since Haleiwa did not carry any. As he landed around 8:40a.m., he had to avoid friendly anti-aircraft and ground fire. Once he was on the ground, several officers told Taylor and Welch to leave the airplanes, but the two pilots were able to convince the officers into allowing them to keep fighting.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1924, the oiler [...] put in at Norfolk Naval Shipyard for {{extensive}} {{modifications to}} become the Navy's first airship tender. An experimental <b>mooring</b> <b>mast</b> [...] above the water was constructed; additional accommodations both for the crew of Shenandoah and for the men who would handle and supply the airship were added; facilities for the helium, gasoline, and other supplies necessary for Shenandoah were built, as well as handling and stowage facilities for three seaplanes. Shenandoah engaged in a short series of mooring experiments with Patoka to determine the practicality of mobile fleet support of scouting airships. The first successful mooring was made on 8 August. During October 1924, Shenandoah flew from Lakehurst to California and on to Washington State to test newly erected mooring masts. This was the first flight of a rigid airship across North America.|$|E

5000|$|Airship hangars or airship sheds are {{generally}} larger than conventional aircraft hangars, particularly in height. Most early airships used hydrogen gas {{to provide them}} with sufficient buoyancy for flight, so their hangars had to provide protection from stray sparks to keep the gas from exploding. Hangars that held several airships were at risk from chain-reaction explosions. For this reason, most hangars for hydrogen-based airships were built to house only one or two such craft. During the [...] "Golden Age" [...] of airship travel from 1900, <b>mooring</b> <b>masts</b> and sheds were constructed to build and house airships. The British government built a shed in Karachi for the R101, the Brazilian government built one in Rio de Janeiro, the :pt:Hangar do Zeppelin for the German Zeppelins and the US government constructed Moffett Field, Akron, Ohio and Lakehurst Naval Air Station, Lakehurst, New Jersey.|$|R

2500|$|On August 25, 1927, when captain Charles E. Rosendahl {{was on the}} ground, Settle {{happened}} be {{the senior}} officer on board Los Angeles when the airship, tied to a <b>mooring</b> <b>mast,</b> literally [...] "stood on its nose". At 13:29 a sudden cold weather front hit Los Angeles; the resulting increase in the buoyancy of the airship, warmed by sunlight, pushed it upward. The tail freely went up while the nose remained tied to the tower. Settle requested Rosendahl's permission to disengage from the tower, but the captain [...] "saw no need for it". Winds threw the tail further upward; Settle sent the men into the tail, but Los Angeles kept rising until reaching a nearly vertical (88 degrees) nose-down position. The airship slowly rotated back; Settle called his men back and released aft balance, saving Los Angeles from a tail-first impact. Los Angeles survived the accident and served until 1932, performing 331 flights without major accidents or fatalities.|$|E

Lieutenant-Colonel Richmond was appointed Director of Design: later he was credited as [...] "Assistant Director of Airship Development (Technical)" [...] with Squadron Leader Michael Rope as his assistant, and the Director for Flying and Training, responsible for all operational matters for both airships, was Major G.H. Scott, who had developed the design of the <b>mooring</b> <b>masts</b> that were to be built. It was based at the Royal Airship Works at Cardington, Bedfordshire, which had been built by Shorts during the First World War and had been employed by the Admiralty to copy and improve on the latest German designs from captured rigid airships. It had been nationalised in 1919 but after the loss of the R38 (then in the process of being transferred to the US as ZR2) naval airship development was stopped and it had been placed on a care and maintenance basis.|$|R
2500|$|On Monday 22 May 1911 Mayfly {{was removed}} from the shed for {{handling}} and mooring trials.
