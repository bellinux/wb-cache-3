When Fock's publication pre-empted Hartree's work on equations with exchange, Hartree turned his research to radio-wave propagation {{that led to the}} Appleton-Hartree equation. In 1935, his father, William Hartree, offered to do calculations for him. Results with exchange soon followed. Douglas recognised the importance of configuration interaction that he referred to as [...] "superposition of configurations".The first <b>multiconfiguration</b> Hartree-Fock results were published by father, son, and Bertha Swirles (later Lady Jeffreys) in 1939.|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} PQS program was {{developed}} by Meyer and Pulay in the late 1960s. They both were at the Max-Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics in Munich when they began to write a new ab initio program. The main purpose was to establish new ab initio techniques. Pulay and Meyer had slightly different interests. Pulay was interested in implementing gradient geometry optimization, analytical energy derivatives (force), and force constant calculations via the numerical differentiation of analytical forces, while Meyer enthused about the coupled-electron pair approximation (CEPA), spin density calculation, and extremely accurate correlation methods like pseudonatural orbital-configuration interaction (PNO-CI). At that time, analytical gradients were limited to closed-shell Hartree-Fock wavefunctions. However, {{they were able to}} do it for unrestricted (UHF) and restricted open-shell (ROHF) methods in 1970. The first version of the code was completed in 1969 at Max-Planck institute and University of Stuttgart. Then, Meyer named it “MOLPRO” and used Gaussian lobe basis sets. In the 1970s, the current version of MOLPRO added a number of advanced methods such as <b>multiconfiguration</b> self-consistent field (MC-SCF) and internally contracted multireference configuration interaction (MR-CI). Simultaneously, in the 1980s, MOLPRO was extended and mostly rewritten by Hans-Joachim Werner, Peter Knowles and Meyer’s coworkers.|$|E

By applying the rigorous Kohn-Sham method to this case, we construct the proper interacting and non-interacting energy functionals. Following the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem for both energy functionals, we derive the corre-sponding <b>multiconfiguration</b> Kohn-Sham equations. At the end of the analysis we show that, at the ground state, the <b>multiconfiguration</b> wavefunction must collapse into a single-determinant wavefunction, equal to the regular KS wavefunction.

40|$|<b>Multiconfiguration</b> wave {{function}} expansions combined with configuration interaction methods are {{a method of}} choice for complex atoms where atomic state functions are expanded in a basis of configuration state functions. Combined with a variational method such as the <b>multiconfiguration</b> Hartree-Fock (MCHF) or <b>multiconfiguration</b> Dirac-Hartree-Fock (MCDHF), the associated set of radial functions can be optimized for the levels of interest. The present review updates the variational MCHF theory to include MCDHF, describes the multireference single and double process for generating expansions and the systematic procedure of a computational scheme for monitoring convergence. It focuses on the calculations of energies and {{wave function}}s from which other atomic properties can be predicted such as transition rates, hyperfine structures and isotope shifts, for example.

40|$|A <b>multiconfiguration</b> {{microscopic}} method {{has been applied}} with the Gogny effective interaction to the calculation of low-lying positive-parity states in even-even $^{ 26 - 28 }$Si isotopes. The aim {{of the study is}} to compare the results of this approach with those of a standard method of GCM type and to get insight into the predictive power of <b>multiconfiguration</b> methods employed with effective nucleon-nucleon force taylored to mean-field calculations. It is found that the <b>multiconfiguration</b> approach leads to an excellent description of the low-lying spectroscopy of $^{ 26 }$Si, $^{ 28 }$Si and $^{ 32 }$Si, but gives a systematic energy shift in $^{ 30 }$Si. A careful analysis of this phenomenon shows that this discrepancy originates from too large matrix elements in the proton-neutron residual interaction supplied by the Gogny interaction. Finally, a statistical analysis of highly excited configurations in $^{ 28 }$Si is performed, revealing exponential convergence in agreement with previous work {{in the context of the}} shell model approach. This latter result provides strong arguments towards an implicit treatment of highly excited configurations. Comment: 17 pages, 13 figures, 11 table...|$|E

40|$|The <b>multiconfiguration</b> {{methods are}} the natural {{generalization}} of the well-known Hartree-Fock theory for atoms and molecules. By a variational method, we prove {{the existence of}} a minimum of the energy and of infinitely many solutions of the <b>multiconfiguration</b> equations, a finite number of them being interpreted as excited states of the molecule. Our results are valid when the total nuclear charge Z exceeds N − 1 (N is the number of electrons) and cover most of the methods used by chemists.

40|$|We {{present a}} new method for the {{computation}} of electronic excited states of molecular systems. This method {{is based upon}} a recent theoretical definition of <b>multiconfiguration</b> excited states (due to one of us, see M. Lewin, Solutions of the <b>Multiconfiguration</b> Equations in Quantum Chemistry, Arch. Rat. Mech. Anal. 171 (2004) 83 - 114). Contrarily to previously used methods, our algorithm always converges to a stationary state of the <b>multiconfiguration</b> model, which {{can be interpreted as}} an approximate excited state of the molecule. We also compare our method to other approaches and give some explanation of the unsatisfactory behaviours which are sometimes observed when using the latter. The definition is variational. To compute the first excited state, one has to deform paths on a manifold, like this is usually done in the search for transition states between reactants and products on potential energy surfaces. We propose here a general method for the deformation of paths which could also be useful in other settings. Numerical results for the special case of two-electrons systems are provided. We compute the first singlet excited state potential energy surface of the $H_ 2 $ molecule, and give some numerical results concerning Helium-like atoms...|$|E

40|$|We present recent {{advances}} {{in the development of}} atomic ab initio <b>multiconfiguration</b> Dirac– Hartree–Fock theory, implemented in the GRASP relativistic atomic structure code. For neutral atoms, the deviations of properties calculated within the Dirac–Hartree–Fock (DHF) method (based on independent particle model of an atomic cloud) are usually dominated by electron correlation effects, i. e. the non-central interactions of individual electrons. We present the {{recent advances}} in accurate calculations of electron correlation effects in small, medium, and heavy neutral atoms. We describe methods of systematic development of <b>multiconfiguration</b> expansions leading to systematic, controlled improvement of the accuracy of the ab initio calculations. These methods originate from the concept of the complete active space (CAS) model within the DHF theory, which, at least in principle, permits fully relativistic calculations with full account of electron correlation effects. The calculations within the CAS model on currently available computer systems are feasible only for very light systems. For heavier atoms or ions with more than a few electrons, restrictions have to be imposed on the <b>multiconfiguration</b> expansions. We present methods and tools, which are designed to extend the numerical calculations in a controlled manner, where <b>multiconfiguration</b> expansions account for all leading electron correlation effects. We show examples of applications of the GRASP code to calculations of hyperfine structure constants, but the code may be used for calculations of arbitrary bound-state atomic properties. In recent years it has been applied to calculations of atomic and ionic spectra (transition energies and rates), to determinations of nuclear electromagnetic moments, as well as to calculations related to interactions of bound electrons with nuclear electromagnetic moments leading to violations of discrete symmetries...|$|E
