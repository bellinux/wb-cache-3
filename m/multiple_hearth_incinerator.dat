40|$|The King 2 ̆ 7 s Landing Wastewater Treatment Plant treats {{industrial}} sewer wastewater {{from nearly}} 200 manufacturing buildings for Eastman Kodak Company located at Kodak Park in Rochester, NY. The average throughput for {{the facility is}} 28 million gallons of wastewater per day (MGD) and discharges the resulting effluent into the Genesee River. Through a series of physical, chemical, and biological treatment processes, materials are removed from the wastewater and sludge is produced. The sludge is conveyed through a belt press for dewatering prior to incineration. The dewatered sludge is sent to a <b>multiple</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>incinerator</b> with a secondary combustion chamber/afterburner for thermal treatment. From the combustion and incineration process, off-gases are produced. Therefore, air pollution control equipment is needed to treat the gas stream. At King 2 ̆ 7 s Landing, an induced draft fan creates negative pressure through the hearth along {{with a series of}} air pollution control equipment (APCE) consisting of a quench chamber, condenser/scrubber, venturi, entrainment separator, and a wet electrostatic precipitator (WESP). This equipment captures the components in the air stream through processes such as gas saturation, caustic neutralization, and electron particle collection. The WESP is a device that is used for fine particle collection in the range of 1 micron or less. Upon entereing the unit, the particles in the gas stream are given a charge. The particles accumulate {{on the surface of the}} WESP and are periodically flushed out and collected in the wash water. The efficiency of particles removed from the WESP can be indirectly correlated by the power value measured in KVA (kilovolt amps). As the power decreases, the particulate collection efficiency is lowered. This is due to the increased resistance in the system. Although there is system variability, the King 2 ̆ 7 s Landing <b>multiple</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>incinerator</b> and associated air pollution control equipment operates in accordance with all relevant environmental standards. The purpose of this thesis is to use statistical analysis tools to determine the significant variables that affect the performance and efficiency of the WESP. The WESP is the last unit in the air pollution control equipment (APCE) system at King 2 ̆ 7 s Landing. Since the WESP is the final air-polishing device in the system, its optimal performance is critical. The WESP is subject to the most variability from the upstream APCE as well as the combustion process because it is the final unit in the system. This paper will analyze multiple predictor variables, which are inputs into the WESP, and determine their significance on the power reading that will serve as the response variable...|$|E

The two plants have a combined capacity of 36 million gallons per day of wastewater. In 1992, the Osborne plant concluded a study evaluating its options for future municipal sewage sludge disposal. The study included the options of rehabilitation of an existing eight year old <b>multiple</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>incinerator,</b> addition of a new multiple hearth, addition of a new fluid bed system, drying, composting and land application. The choice was a new fluid bed system based on both economic and environmental reasons. Design of the new fluid bed system began in December 1994 and equipment delivery for the incineration system was begun in April 1995. Initial operation occurred in August 1996. Primary and secondary sludge, dewatered to 28 % dry solids by centrifuge, is delivered by piston pumps to the 20 ’ freeboard ID incinerator. A shell and tube heat exchanger recuperates heat from the exhaust gas and preheats the combustion air to 1250 F, resulting in minimal auxiliary fuel use. The air pollution control device is a high energy dual tandem nozzle scrubber. Greensboro was the initial installation of this scrubber design on a fluid bed incinerator and its characteristics and performance are discussed.

The implementation of the EMPC requires a dynamic model which is simplified from a previously developed mechanistic model of the MHF. The simplified model is developed {{in the form of}} a nonlinear Hammerstein-Wiener model, which is linearized at every sampling time to carry out the state estimation and MPC optimization tasks. As the accuracy of the simplified process model is crucial for performance of the EMPC, the thesis aims to compare the simulation results of the mechanistic model and the simplified one. The comparison of the models show that the simplified model follows accurately the mechanistic model in all cases. A description of the process of interest is given, with an emphasis in outlining the overall control strategy currently implemented. Next the components of the EMPC design are illustrated, including the overall strategy, the cost function and the necessary models of the process.

Control over process variables and other process variations ensure a reliable end product quality and provide stability and efficiency for the process. The process considered in this thesis is the calcination of Kaolin in a <b>Multiple</b> <b>Hearth</b> furnace which consists of 8 hearths with four burners each on hearths 4 and 6 that supply the energy required for calcination. The aim of this thesis is to develop data based models for the gas temperature profile in the <b>multiple</b> <b>hearth</b> furnace which is a key process variable determining the gas-solid heat exchange, and thus, affecting the final product quality. The models can be utilized to forecast furnace dynamics, to develop a model-based control which reduces variations in the gas flow rates into the hearths {{as well as for}} model based optimization which determines the optimal gas flow rates to hearths 4 and 6. These benefits of the gas temperature profile prediction may help to minimize the energy consumed by the burners and also to improve the control of the final product quality while maintaining the quality constraints. In this thesis, the relevant literature on statistical data processing methods are reviewed and case studies are presented to demonstrate the application of data based modeling in mineral processing. Thereafter, required data-based static and dynamic models are constructed using statistical techniques such as the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and the Partial Least Squares (PLS). The model accuracy is improved by combining the process data with the chemical engineering knowledge of the process. The models are constructed for the most common feed rates and finally validated using process data not used for training. Results are presented and the models were able to predict the gas temperature profiles in the furnace in each of the hearths; the dynamic models improved the model quality when compared to the static models. In addition, a future prediction of the temperature profile was carried out to confirm the ability of the dynamic models to predict the furnace behavior. Also, the possibility of utilizing the dynamic models for process control and optimization is discussed...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{records the}} {{research}} into {{aspects of the}} late- 17 th century Sheffield cutlery trades. The key research resources are the 1672 Ladyday Hearth Tax returns for the parishes of Sheffield, Ecclesfield and Handsworth in the Scarsdale Hundred and the records of apprentices and freedoms of the Cutlers' Company in Hall=shire. These documents, which provide correlating evidence for the numbers and distribution of cutlers and other cutlery craftsmen, have been combined with data from probate inventories, parish records, leases and rentals. This particular Hearth Tax return {{is important because it}} had separate listings of the smithy hearths, because of local opposition to the tax. Although work has been done into the size of the late- 17 th century Sheffield cutlery industry, it has not previously been possible to show the occupations of the taxpayers. By correlating these two contemporary sets of records, the cutlery craftsmen have been identified and located, revealing that numbers of craftsmen did not own a smithy hearth and that some craft groups generally had <b>multiple</b> <b>hearths.</b> These factors, men with <b>multiple</b> smithy <b>hearths</b> and men without one, all indicate a manufacturing organisation more complex than the simple system of a master involved in all processes, assisted by his journeyman and apprentice. This research has refined earlier descriptions by locating the craftsmen more accurately and linking their distribution with geographical features, such as the available waterpower, or with the social influence of an existing community dominated by core families. The research presents data, which shows that by 1672, the trades were fragmenting, and many men were probably specialising in one or more manufacturing process. The reconstruction of the communities, based on the Hearth Tax returns, has shown that expansion during the 18 th century was often based on the characteristics developed in the previous century and that 19 th and 20 th century work practices had their roots in the 17 th century.

The overall control strategy for the MHF is developed as a three level control hierarchy: optimizing level, stabilizing level, and basic level. In the literature part of the thesis, first, the kaolin and its formation process is discussed. Next, the general information about calcination process is provided and the calcination of kaolin is discussed. Finally, few past researches having similar objective to this study are reviewed to study the various different control approaches developed so far and the possibility to implement them in our study. In the experimental part, analysis of the process is carried using the experimental data. During the data analysis, activation/ deactivation of the exothermic reaction in the hearth 4 is seen, which is crucial in determining the temperature profile of the furnace. Hence, the soft sensor based on the energy balance to estimate the intensity of the exothermic reaction, which plays a key role in developing the control strategy for the MHF, is developed. Both the static and dynamic energy balance equations are presented, calculated and compared in order to study the dynamic behaviour in the process. It is seen that the dynamic energy balance provides more accurate results than the static energy balance due to the consideration of the transition period...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{results of}} chemical, {{mechanical}} and metallographic studies of {{elements of the}} design of a <b>multiple</b> <b>hearth</b> furnace from the steel 1. 4837 and 1. 4857 according to EN 10295 : 2002 are given in order to establish possible causes of its emergency shutdown. Among the possible causes of failures of elements the following ones are considered: non-operation of the safety device, degradation of material properties, as well as development of cracks in these surfaces caused by the high temperature and force action. The study has found out that the basic chemical composition, structure, and mechanical properties of the construction material ensure normal operation of the furnace to a temperature of up to 10500 С. Exceeding this temperature and periodical heating and cooling of the basic elements (thermal cycles) leads to emission of complex carbide inclusions on the dendrite boundaries. Frequent thermal cycles as well as the significant heterogeneity in distribution of non-metallic inclusions and carbides leads to degradation of material properties. While establishing causes of a failure of a safety device, the authors have found out that the increase of the gap between the sleeves results in a relatively small change in the cutoff force by increasing the proportion of normal stresses from bending. A more significant increase in the shear force occurs at the minimum cross section of the pin offset {{from the edge of the}} plane.

[...] Hayden’s team excavated Housepit #7 which measured 19 meters in diameter from rim crest to rim crest. They estimated that at least 45 people lived in this structure at one time—perhaps eight separate families or domestic units. The deposits found here indicated that these occupants enjoyed substantial economic resources and wealth compared to the residents of small structures. Higher grade construction materials and processes were employed. There were <b>multiple</b> <b>hearths</b> used regularly, some of them unusually large. Per capita storage areas were far larger and numerous than other housepits. [...] High quality foods were available including more meat products (such as fox, bear, and sheep) and some unexpected species (such as scallops which would have been obtained in trade from the coast). [...] These occupants had access to a wide array of wealth items. Overall, they were economically well off. It is possible that they even had dogs as pets.Separate domestic units in the large housepit each contained hearths, tools, comforts, and conveniences. The structure held a central communal area with an especially large hearth. The division of the overall space indicates the possibility of sexual division of workspaces and for a “fundamental socioeconomic division” within the structure - perhaps including controlling families and tenant families or those who worked for the household. [...] It is possible that some members of this household held high status in the community at large.Evidence indicates that the major housepits were continuously occupied over several generations, perhaps more than 1,000 years, by “a single, identifiable social group” which maintained the structure’s roof, storage areas, and basic organization.

As one of the earliest known Pleistocene sites in Australia, with archaeologically sterile sediment beneath deposits containing occupation, the chronology of the site is important in renewed debates surrounding the colonization of Sahul. Charcoal is preserved throughout the sequence and within <b>multiple</b> discrete <b>hearth</b> features. Prior to 14 C dating, charcoal has been pretreated with both acid-base-acid (ABA) and acid base oxidation-stepped combustion (ABOx-SC) methods at multiple laboratories. Ages are consistent between laboratories and also between the two pretreatment methods, suggesting that contamination is easily removed from charcoal at Riwi and the Pleistocene ages are likely to be accurate. Whilst some charcoal samples recovered from outside hearth features are identified as outliers within a Bayesian model, all ages on charcoal within hearth features are consistent with stratigraphy. OSL dating has been undertaken using single quartz grains from the sandy matrix. The majority of samples show De distributions that are well-bleached but that also include evidence for mixing as a result of post-depositional bioturbation of the sediment. The results of the two techniques are compared and evaluated within a Bayesian model. Consistency between the two methods is good, and we demonstrate human occupation at this site from 46. 4 - 44. 6 cal kBP (95. 4 % probability range). Importantly, the lowest archaeological horizon at Riwi is underlain by sterile sediments which have been dated by OSL making it possible to demonstrate the absence of human occupation for between 0. 9 - 5. 2 ka (68. 2 % probability range) prior to occupation...|$|R
40|$|Sulfur {{polymer cement}} (SPC) is a {{thermoplastic}} polymer consisting of 95 wt% elemental sulfur and 5 wt% organic modifiers to enhance long-term durability. SPC was originally {{developed by the}} U. S. Bureau of Mines {{as an alternative to}} hydraulic cement for construction applications. Previous attempts to use elemental sulfur as a construction material in the chemical industry failed due to premature degradation. These failures were caused by the internal stresses that result from changes in crystalline structure upon cooling of the material. By reacting elemental sulfur with organic polymers, the Bureau of Mines developed a product that successfully suppresses the solid phase transition and significantly improves the stability of the product. SPC, originally named modified sulfur cement, is produced from readily available, inexpensive waste sulfur derived from desulfurization of both flue gases and petroleum. The commercial production of SPC is licensed in the United States by Martin Resources (Odessa, Texas) and is marketed under the trade name Chement 2000. It is sold in granular form and is relatively inexpensive ({approx}$ 0. 10 to 0. 12 /lb). Application of SPC for the treatment of radioactive, hazardous, and mixed wastes was initially developed and patented by Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) in the mid- 1980 s (Kalb and Colombo, 1985; Colombo et al., 1997). The process was subsequently investigated by the Commission of the European Communities (Van Dalen and Rijpkema, 1989), Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (Darnell, 1991), and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (Mattus and Mattus, 1994). SPC has been used primarily in microencapsulation applications but can also be used for macroencapsulation of waste. SPC microencapsulation has been demonstrated to be an effective treatment {{for a wide variety of}} wastes, including <b>incinerator</b> <b>hearth</b> and fly ash; aqueous concentrates such as sulfates, borates, and chlorides; blowdown solutions; soils; and sludges.

The site of Limon-Raspail is localized on a small hill at 350 m height and covers a surface of almost 15 000 square meters. The site dominates the Mormoiron depression in the south and the one of Bédoin in the north. The excavation carried out on a surface of 250 square meters has allowed discovery of a settlement organized around thirty-five pits. It is assigned to the Final Neolithic and dated to a time span of between 2880 and 2580 cal BC at most. This interval is based on six radiocarbon AMS dates made from faunal remains and charcoal all stemming from distinct features. Multiple occupations are possible as some of the pits overlap. As a matter of fact, with this in mind, the homogeneity of the pottery and lithic assemblages as well as the uniformity of all the radiocarbon measurements indicate that the different phases of pit digging have occurred within a rather short time span and that the site of Limon-Raspail is consistent from the chronological and cultural viewpoint. These pit features mirror an area of activities related to a dwelling. As a matter of fact, a group of rather deep pits with narrow shape was unearthed in the excavated sector. A form of silo pit, they may be destined for storage purposes. Associated with these storage features, fire places are also discovered, for example shallow pits or depressions as well as hearth structures. Large amounts of daub and unbaked clay found on the site are used for <b>multiple</b> purposes (artefacts, <b>hearth</b> features, sealing of storage features, rendering of the bottom). The importance of daub remains discovered in the pits suggests the presence of earth architecture: the large size of the identified fragments and the important dimensions of wattle imprints on those fragments at least testify to the presence of important elevations of settlement walls. This monographic paper presents an exhaustive description of all artefacts (pottery, lithics, ornaments, bone industry, axe blades, grinding tools) and construction remains discovered at Limon-Raspail. In addition, the pottery and the axe blades have been part of an advanced petrographical analysis. Furthermore, the results of the use wear analysis of the lithic industry are published here. Finally, the determination of the faunal remains allows detailed conclusion on the adopted food economy during the Final Neolithic occupation of the site. At Limon-Raspail, the artefacts can hardly be compared to the current assemblages, representing three main cultural groups invoked since almost thirty years {{in the construction of the}} chronological and cultural framework in this area of Southeastern France: the Fraischamp, the North Vaucluse and the Rhône-Ouvèze group. Yet, the site of Limon-Raspail is neighbouring the eponymous sites of these three groups. On the other hand, the location of the settlement, at the northern margins of Province adjacent to the central Rhone valley enables us to make broader comparison with the Drôme region (Allan and Les Bruyères groups), with the Saône-Rhône axis (groups of Lüscherz and Clairvaux) and with the Piedmont in Italy (Mont Viso group). The central Rhone valley thus appears to be at the crossroads of interaction processes connecting the different groups of Southern France to those of more eastern and northern regions. Established in a buffer zone, the site of Limon-Raspail is the only representative of the mecanisms that contribute to the development of multipolar margin groups and to the junction of the different cultural flows that structure the Final Neolithic. À Bédoin dans le Vaucluse, la fouille de sauvetage urgent du Limon- Raspail dirigée par J. Cauliez en 2005 a livré, sur une surface de 250 m 2, une trentaine d'aménagements creusés révélant l'existence d'un habitat relativement bien préservé et implanté en position privilégiée à près de 350 m d'altitude. Le site est daté du Néolithique final, entre 2880 et 2580 av. J. -C. Cette trentaine de structures en creux offre la vision d'une zone d'activités, là où se concentrent des foyers et des aménagements liés à la conservation, tous réutilisés comme dépotoirs. Voisin de sites éponymes à l'origine de l'identification de trois des quatre principales cultures du Néolithique final du sud-est de la France - les groupes Rhône-Ouvèze, de Fraischamp et du Nord-Vaucluse -, le gisement du Limon-Raspail ne s'accorde pas, sur le plan chronoculturel, avec l'un ou l'autre de ces ensembles. L'originalité du site peut s'expliquer par sa localisation dans une zone tampon. Il est à la limite nord des aires d'extension reconnues pour les groupes provençaux. Il s'inscrit également dans des flux de circulations alimentés par le Piémont italien; il pourrait être enfin en liaison avec des groupes de régions plus septentrionales, tels que ceux de l'axe Saône- Rhône, dont les influences seraient perceptibles, au Néolithique final, jusque dans la moyenne vallée du Rhône...|$|R
