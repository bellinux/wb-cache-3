40|$|This paper {{emerges from}} an {{ethnography}} {{of the economic}} and cultural life of Rye Lane, an intensely multi-ethnic street in Peckham, South London. The effects of accelerated migration into London are explored through the reshaping and diversification of its interior, street and city spaces. A ‘trans-ethnography’ is pursued across the compendium of micro-, meso- and <b>macro-urban</b> spaces, without reifying one above the other. The ethnographic stretch across intimate, collective and symbolic city spaces serves to connect how the restrictions and circuits of urban migration have different impacts and expressions in these distinctive but interrelated urban localities. The paper argues for a trans-ethnography that engages within and across a compendium of urban localities, to understand how accelerated migration and urban ‘super-diversity’ transform the contemporary global city...|$|E
40|$|The Fourier {{transform}} and {{spectral analysis}} are employed {{to estimate the}} fractal dimension and explore the fractal parameter relations of urban growth and form using mathematical experiments and empirical analyses. Based on the models of urban density, two kinds of fractal dimensions of urban form can be evaluated with the scaling relations between the wave number and the spectral density. One is the radial dimension of self-similar distribution indicating the <b>macro-urban</b> patterns, and the other, the profile dimension of self-affine tracks indicating the micro-urban evolution. If a city's growth follows the power law, the summation of the two dimension values may be a constant under certain condition. The estimated results of the radial dimension suggest a new fractal dimension, which can be termed “image dimension”. A dual-structure model named particle-ripple model (PRM) is proposed to explain the connections and differences between the macro and micro levels of urban form...|$|E

This study analyzes spatio-temporal characteristics of urban expansion in China using satellite images and regionalization methods. Landsat TM images at three time periods, 1990 / 1991, 1995 / 1996, and 1999 / 2000, are interpreted to get 1 : 100000 vector land use datasets. The study calculates the urban land percentage and urban land expansion index of every 1 km(2) cell throughout China. The study divides China into 27 urban regions to conceive dynamic patterns of urban land changes. Urban development was achieving momentum in the western region, expanding more noticeably {{than in the previous}} five years, and seeing an increased growth percentage. Land use dynamic changes reflect the strong impacts of economic growth environments and <b>macro-urban</b> development policies. The paper helps to distinguish the influences of newly market-oriented forces from traditional administrative controls on China's urban expansion. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSoutheast Asia {{has been}} {{situated}} on the crossroads of maritime trading routes for centuries, and has been the hub of overseas trade and cultural exchange throughout recorded history. Southeast Asian civilizations and the lifestyles of Southeast Asian peoples {{have been influenced by}} trade, and the evolutionary process of urban morphology and building typology of its commercial port cities are testimony to this. This paper is a study of Southeast Asian port cities and their most predominant traditional dwellings – shophouses – that are subject to a typo-morphological analysis. The study is an examination of these trends at both a <b>macro-urban</b> level and a micro-building level – the development of cities, and the characteristics of shophouses, respectively. The morphological evolution of Southeast Asian port cities is described in chronological order. By selecting two cities – Malacca, and Penang –as case studies, both the specific driving factors of urban evolution and the cultural continuity that is reflected in this process are discussed. Shophouses in Southeast Asian port cities are classified into several types, including serial, partitioned, and combined types. Some sustainable strategies which are used to satisfy people's changing requirement are expounded in each type. It is shown in the study that Southeast Asian port cities have gone through the transition process from closed to open, from single to diverse and from traditional to modern...|$|E
