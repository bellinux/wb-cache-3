40|$|An {{important}} "empirical regularity" is {{the strong}} positive effect of money shocks on output and employment. One strand of business cycle theory relates this finding to temporary confusions between absolute and relative price changes. These models predict positive output effects of unperceived <b>monetary</b> <b>movements,</b> but the quantitative importance of unperceived shifts in nominal aggregates {{is subject to}} question. Another strand of theory, based on long-term nominal contracts and analogous price-setting institutions, generates output effects from unanticipated, but not necessarily contemporaneously unperceived, money shocks. However, the real effects of unpredicted, but contemporaneously understood, monetary changes are not obviously consistent with efficient institutional arrangements. The present paper provides some empirical evidence on {{the two types of}} theories by analyzing the output effects associated with revisions in the money stock data, where the revisions are interpreted as components of unperceived <b>monetary</b> <b>movements.</b> The revisions turn out to have no significant explanatory power for output. Previous findings that innovations from an estimated money growth equation have a significant output effect remain intact when the revisions are included as separate explanatory variables. Overall, the study provides a small amount of evidence against the special role of unperceived, as opposed to unanticipated, money movements as a determinant of business fluctuations. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the interaction of}} money and the price level with a business cycle that is fully real in origin, adopting a view which differs sharply from traditional theories that assign a significant causal influence to <b>monetary</b> <b>movements.</b> The theoretical analysis focuses on a banking system that produces transaction. services on demand and thus reflects market activity. Under one regime of bank regulation and fiat money supply by the monetary authority, the real business cycle theory predicts that (i) movements in external monetary measures should be uncorrelated with real activity and(ii) movements in internal monetary measures should be positively correlated with real activity. Preliminary empirical analysis provides general support for this focus on the banking sector since much of the correlation between monetary measures and real activity is apparently with inside money. ...|$|E

The analysis reveals that the actual monetary policy is correlated with the indications of the monetary policies proposed by the switching model.

The small role that monetary changes played in explaining demand fluctuations in the first postwar decade helped maintain intact the Keynesian multiplier framework, but the increasing importance of autonomous <b>monetary</b> <b>movements</b> in the second decade laid the groundwork for a greater emphasis on the potency of monetary policy in the late 1960 s. The widespread acceptance of monetarism owes much to the coincidence in 1968 of an unexpected acceleration in inflation together with the failure of the tax surcharge enacted in that year. Similarly, the increased degree of inertia evident in the behavior of inflation from 1954 on helped win ready acceptance for the idea of a stable Phillips-curve tradeoff, while the refusal of inflation to abate in 1970 helped solidify the victory of the natural hypothesis. A major theme of the paper is the gradual but profound shift in macroeconomics from the dominance of demand issues to a new emphasis on supply topics. Price controls, crop failures, and OPEC actions in the l 970 s have brought supply shocks to the forefront of policy discussions, revived fiscal policy asa means of countering supply shocks, and lessened support for a monetarist reliance on simple policy rules. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{globalization}} {{of the international}} economic, financial and <b>monetary</b> <b>movements</b> around the world, the greater concentration and decentralization {{in the process of}} manufacture, the commerce and the capital, as well as the opening of the national economies opened to the world, enforce the corporations to rationalize its own path of development, as well as their manufacturing and financial policy. In order to all this the corporations should modernize and improve the policy of the financial and dividend policy on middle and long term. And that it’s exactly here, that we can focus the basic problem, an issue that a lot of corporations are faced to, can be most clearly seen. Furthermore, it is the main issue of financing, the investment and dividend policy. The relevance of these social problems, for me, was not only a great challenge, for researching and analyzing, but a great obligation for serious access in its elaboration as well. The dividend policy represents an area interesting for shareholders, {{but at the same time}} it is an area, where the corporative management regarding the possibility of mutual connection between the dividend and the market corporation value, endevours to keep its own interests. The successful realization of dividend policy is a satisfactory base for efficiency of the investment policy, where the influence of great number of other factors is significant such as: the question of insolvency, the financial structure, the stability of net income, the degree of profitability and soon. Providing of the healthy investment policy that will be the leading factor of the national economy towards stability, success and balance, the chances for success will be enormously satisfactory, having in mind the dividend policy as well, that will be aiming at total satisfaction for share holder’s interests, which means payment of high dividend, as a stimulus and potentiality for further investments. The corporations that continually create profit and invest a great part of it, are regarded as successful corporations, which means that they are improving continually and they create better perspective at the same time. It might be criticized, having in mind the shareholder’s aspect, but in a longer term period it would be completely different. By the investment in the corporation itself, by help of the profit means as well as by more successful management and increasing of its economic and financial image, the value of the corporation is enlarging at the same time and consequently the share’s values. In the corporations where the investment is less done, and where the great part of it goes to the dividend, if might come the situation of regressing, and the process of retrogression in other words a development characterized with slow dynamics, and by the point of view of long term period having in mind the aspect of extreme distance, they lose more than they make real profits. The total issue, that has been mentioned so far, I have succeeded in analyzing and researching in eight categories of questions in which synthesis the following fields can be followed. 	the policy of financing, the way and the forms of its implementation and the importance of making the decisions, regarding the investment 	and the dividend police, the stability of dividend payments, the altitude of the dividend payment, as well as the decision to keep or reinvest the achieved profit. The researching and the detailed elaboration of these thematic fields, initiated the awareness to me that in conditions of disadvantageous economic activities, as a result of our reduced investment activity followed by a range of negative economic and social implications especially expressed in unemployment and the social insecurity, the most important thing that should urgently be done is the economic reconstruction, by entrepreneurship, of new, small private enterprises and business, creating conditions for implementation of economic principals in business, strengthening the competition and its ability in the national economy. ...|$|E

40|$|It is well {{documented}} in the literature that identified vector autoregression (VAR) models often produce puzzling results when the effect of unexpected <b>monetary</b> policy <b>movements</b> is estimated. Many authors find that raising interest rate generates protracted appreciation of the exchange rate (the so-called delayed overshooting puzzle) which is in contradiction with traditional theory of exchange rate dynamics based on uncovered interest parity. Since the dynamics of exchange rate is determined to a substantial extent by carry traders, we investigate the behaviour of the exchange rate and carry trade activity within the same VAR for a panel of small open economies. We identify structural shocks by allowing the interest rate and exchange rate to react simultaneously to monetary policy and changes in expected risk premium.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{framework}} is constructed {{within which the}} ability of asset prices to convey information about the underlying shocks hitting the economy can be assessed. An identified VAR is used to establish a set of stylised facts as to how asset prices respond to exogenous <b>monetary</b> policy <b>movements.</b> A theoretical model {{of the economy is}} then developed, and used to analyse how asset prices modelled within it respond to different shocks. Consumers in the model consume both market-produced and home-produced goods.

Non-traded goods producers face costs of adjusting their capital stocks and can only reset their prices once a year in a staggered fashion. It is shown that the model is able to replicate the stylised facts found in the empirical exercise. It is then shown how asset prices respond to shocks to productivity in the traded, non-traded and household production sectors and a shock to the world price of traded goods. With these results, it is possible to assess what information asset prices may give us about the shocks affecting the economy at any particular time. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{exchange}} rate {{is an important}} part of the transmission mechanism in the determination of <b>monetary</b> policy because <b>movements</b> in the {{exchange rate}} have significant effect on the macroeconomy. It can be diffcult to measure the reaction of monetary policy to the movements of the exchange rate, due to the simultaneous response of monetary policy to the exchange rate and the possibility that both variables respond to several other variables. This study addresses these problems by using an identification method based on the heteroscedasticity in the high-frequency data. The results in this paper suggest that the ECB systematically responds to exchange rate movements but that quantitative effects are small. Such a significant but small reaction coefficient seems consistent with the hypothesis that the central banks do not target the fluctuations in the exchange rate but consider them only to the extent they impact on the expected inflation and output path. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a theoretical framework}} to study the relationship between <b>monetary</b> policy and <b>movements</b> in risk.

Accordingly, prices for risky assets respond sharply to aggregate shocks because only a relatively small subset of attentive consumers are available to absorb these shocks. We show that the model can account for both the mean and the volatility of returns on equity and the risk-free rate, and in line with empirical evidence generates {{a decline in the}} equity premium following an unanticipated easing of monetary policy.

To the policy makers, the influence {{and the existence of}} special relationship between monetary aggregates and other macroeconomic variables are important in designing policies such as to curb inflation pressure, stimulating economic growth and reduce unemployment problem. On the other hand, the researchers may use these aggregates and their relations with macroeconomic variables to estimate a complex macro model of an economy. In Malaysia, traditionally, monetary aggregate has been the major monetary policy strategy. Targeting M 1, M 2 and M 3 has been the main policy targets until the mid- I 990 s. However, by the mid- 1990 s, the Central Bank of Malaysia (BNM) has shifted their policy strategy from monetary targeting to interest rate targeting. As a matter of fact, the de-emphasizing of monetary aggregates as intermediate target begins with the de-emphasizing of MI in 1987. One of the major reasons for de-emphasizing monetary aggregates as policy variables is the availability of alternative interest-bearing financial assets in the markets as a result of active financial liberalization in recent years. As a result of the shifting of money into interest- bearing financial assets, the relationship between money and income becomes unstable, consequently, monetary policy actions using monetary aggregates as targets become ineffective. Our question is: Does the move made by BNM to de-emphasis monetary aggregates point to the fact that money does not affect output in Malaysia? In other words, one can ask: Does changes in money bring about in the changes on real economic variables? If none of the real economic variables would change in response to the change in money, we say that money is neutral. The neutrality of money has important implications for the role of monetary policy. In monetary-business-cycle (MBC) models...|$|R

40|$|A {{feature of}} U.

First, {{at least part of the}} paper-bill spread's predictive content with respect to business cycle fluctuations stems from its role as an indicator of monetary policy, but the 1990 - 91 recession was unusual in post-war U.

Second, <b>movements</b> of the spread during the few years just prior to the 1990 - 91 recession were strongly influenced by changes in the relative quantities of commercial paper, bank CDs and Treasury bills that occurred for reasons unrelated to the business cycle.

Anticipated exchange rate depreciation, through the supply channel, has limited effects on output growth and inflation. Unanticipated currency fluctuations appear more significant, with varying effects on output growth and price inflation across developing countries.

40|$|Financing pension systems necessitates that {{actual output}} is redistributed from workers and {{entrepreneurs}} actually in activity {{in favour of}} retirees. Therefore, in a closed economy, the return on accrued pension funds, to be distributed to pensioners, is ceiled by the real growth of income, unless the share of income levied on active workers increases indefinitely. Only possible revenues from past foreign investment can increase the overall resources available to pay domestic pensions. Thus, an efficient pre funded pension system inevitably stimulates large international capital movements. The paper sheds some light on an issue often overlooked in {{the debate on the}} merits and drawbacks of different systems, i. e. their possible consequences on interest and exchange rates. In order to provide an explicit solution for the dynamics of the relevant variables, the paper adopts an analytical approach more simple than the usual overlapping generation models. In particular, the paper confirms that in an aging society, with a fully indexed PAYG system, a constant contribution rate would make the public debt and related interest rates explode. On the other hand, in a pre-funded system, interest rates should be set below the national growth rates, and exchange rates must be ready to accommodate to large deficit of the balance of payment for many decades after the switch from a PAYG system, and later to large surplus.
