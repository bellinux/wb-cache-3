5000|$|McLeod {{attended}} St Peter's Collegiate Girls' School {{and started}} singing {{in her late}} teens. In 1990 she commenced a university course doing a bachelor of arts at Flinders University in Adelaide. 3 months into the course she went on a holiday with friends to Bali, where she was invited to join a Balinese band. Although being her first time on stage , she took to it like a duck to water and played with the band every night during her visit. McLeod later remembered [...] "I could already play a bit of guitar by then but did little more than sing and play to <b>my</b> <b>buddies</b> at home." [...] Upon her return to Adelaide , armed with a new passion for performing, she quit uni and formed her first group, Fallen Down Monster (FDM). She displayed her rock-chick characteristics and honed her vocal and guitar skills, and fun-loving, energetic stage presence. FDM performed indie band covers, McLeod wrote original tracks which were not recorded.|$|E
5000|$|When he came {{to enroll}} at Auburn University, the clerk at the Registrar's office asked him if the Marine Corps taught him {{anything}} useful.

But some of us had to do the killing — and most of <b>my</b> <b>buddies</b> got killed or wounded." [...] He found his salvation in science, as it kept the flashbacks of Peleliu and Okinawa at bay. Close, constant study of nature prevented him from going mad; however, the war stayed with him, and finally at the urging of his wife, he began to put his thoughts on paper, at last allowing him to put his horrors behind him. He returned to Auburn in 1953 where he worked as a research assistant until 1955. That same year he graduated from API with a Master of Science degree in botany.|$|E

Under the name [...] "Vivian Alice Elaine Dobbs," [...] she {{attended}} the Venable Public Elementary School of Charlottesville for four terms, from September 1930 until May 1932. Stephen Jay Gould wrote:She was an student, neither particularly outstanding nor much troubled. In those days before grade inflation, when C meant [...] "good, 81-87" [...] (as defined on her report card) rather than barely scraping by, Vivian Dobbs received As and Bs for deportment and Cs for all academic subjects but mathematics (which was always difficult for her, and where she scored a D) during her first term in Grade 1A, from September 1930 to January 1931. She improved during her second term in 1B, meriting an A in deportment, C in mathematics, and B in all other academic subjects; she was on the honor roll in April 1931. Promoted to 2A, she had trouble during the fall term of 1931, failing mathematics and spelling but receiving an A in deportment, B in reading, and C in writing and English. She was [...] "retained in 2A" [...] for the next term -- or [...] "left back" [...] as was formerly said, and scarcely a sign of imbecility as I remember all <b>my</b> <b>buddies</b> who suffered a similar fate. In any case, she again did well in her final term, with B in deportment, reading, and spelling, and C in writing, English, and mathematics during her last month in school. This offspring of [...] "lewd and immoral" [...] women excelled in deportment and performed adequately, although not brilliantly, in her academic subjects.|$|E
