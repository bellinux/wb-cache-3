40|$|Abstract. Based on {{different}} statistics, we could {{consider that the}} most frequent operation in plastic surgery is breast surgery {{with the support of}} <b>mammary</b> <b>implants.</b> Some women have from the beginning those aesthetic features to seduce the audience but others need some improvements by using artificial implants and surgical techniques to obtain similar results. In the last time, specialists from medicine and engineering try to find out technical solutions to obtain good quality <b>mammary</b> <b>implants</b> using advanced polymeric biomaterials or surface modifying techniques, in order to assure more time lasting for these implants and less reactivity from the human body. Today, the <b>mammary</b> <b>implants</b> are manufactured currently by a silicone elastomer shell filled with cohesive silicone gel or with saline liquid.

40|$|Background: {{the most}} common {{complication}} experienced by patients who have undergone <b>mammary</b> <b>implant</b> surgery is capsular contracture. This matter concerns physicians and patients, but to date, there is no effective way to avoid this complication. Surgical intervention usually is required. in 2002, the use of zafirlukast, a leukotriene inhibitor (a drug used for asthma treatment), was reported {{for the treatment of}} capsular contracture, with good results. Methods: for this study, 30 female Wistar rats were used. These animals received two silicone implants each: one with a smooth surface and one with a textured surface. All the animals received daily intraperitoneal injections for 90 days and were divided as follows: control group (C) receiving only saline solution, experimental group 1 (E-I) receiving 1. 25 mg/kg/day of zafirlukast, and experimental group 2 (E-II) receiving 5 mg/kg/day of zafirlukast. Histologic analysis used hematoxilin and eosin to verify vessels, capsule thickness, and inflammatory cells. Immunoistochemical analysis with smooth muscle anti-actin antibody was used for myofibroblast verification. Picro-Sirius under polarized light was used for collagen analysis. Results: Textured implant experimental groups presented smaller numbers of vessels, thinner capsules, lower collagen density, and smaller numbers of mastocytes and eosinophils than the control group. No significant differences were found in smooth surface implants, as compared with the control group. Conclusion: Zafirlukast reduced the occurrence of factors directly and indirectly connected with capsular contracture.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to ascertain i f <b>mammary</b> <b>implants</b> are prone to any change in conformation or structure i f submitted to recreational diving. Material and methods: Severi new implants (Mentor Siltex® Round gel and Siltex® Becker 50 Expander/ Mammary implant; McGhan style 120, 110, 150 and 410) and one undamaged implant removed after two years (McGhan style 410), were submitted to 40 simulated dives in a hyperbaric air compressed facility. Four matching implants were used as a control. Two immersions a day (maximum depth and bottom time of - 39 mt and 30 min) were simulated, at controlied temperature (21 °C) and humidity (between 60 and 70 %). A photograph of ali implants was taken before and after the study. The volume of <b>mammary</b> <b>implants</b> was assessed at sea lcvel before and after each simulated dive by immersing the devices in a closed, water filled container where volume changes were determined by variations of water level in a capillary tube. After each simulated dive, the integrity of the implants was checked. Computerised tomography scan of each implant was done at the end of the protocol to assess variations in gel density, using the Hounsfield unit scale. Results: No implants showed ruptures or variation in volume. Ali implants showed shape alterations, doublé lumen implants showed also irregularity of the inner shell. No alterations of the density could be detected in new implants group. The two-year-old implant showed a hyperdense irregularly ovai shaped profile inside the implant.

Physical examinations and complications were recorded by physicians at 3 months and annually thereafter until 10 years postimplantation. Descriptive statistics were used and key complications were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier analysis method. Results: Two ruptures were observed within 5 years postimplantation, {{one of which was}} subject to mechanical trauma during reoperation and the other was identified during routine screening. Capsular contracture, {{one of the most common}} complications associated with breast implants, was reported in 6. 6 % implants across all indications through 5 years.

40|$|Background One of {{the causes}} of capsular {{contraction}} is the forming of a biofilm through contamination of the implant with coagulase negative staphylococci. These commensal bacteria are non-pathogenous but can contaminate the implant during or after surgery. Objective Preventing colonization of the implant by irrigating it with teicoplanin before implantation in two-stage breast surgery. This procedure should lead to decrease capsular contracture. Methods Thirty tissue expanders in 26 patients were included in the study over a period of 21 months. Tissue expanders were irrigated with saline or teicoplanin before implantation. In the second stage surgery samples were taken from the capsule and the tissue expander. The independent samples t-test and the chi-square test were performed to do the statistical analyses. Results Thirty tissue expanders were implanted and 25 were exchanged for a definite implant. Five tissue expanders were colonized with coagulase negative staphylococci. There was no grade III/IV capsular contraction in any of the cases. Every tissue expander resulted in a grade I capsular contracture. No relation was found between the use of teicoplanin and colonization of the implant. Conclusion Antimicrobial coating with teicoplanin is not likely to reduce the colonization of S. epidermidis <b>mammary</b> <b>implants</b> or to reduce capsular contraction in breast surgery. Neither does the use of teicoplanin result in fewer complications. This is the first study to look at the effects of local use of antibiotics on capsular contracture in breast surgery.

40|$|The use of <b>mammary</b> <b>implants</b> {{may lead}} to a variety of early and delayed {{complications}}. The most common delayed complications are capsular contracture and implant failure. Late seroma has seldom been reported. In a long-term prospective observational study, cases of late seroma were assessed and recorded. Between March 2005 and November 2009, suspected cases of late seroma in patients who had undergone breast augmentation or reconstruction with textured implants were evaluated clinically and with instrumental analyses. An ultrasound-guided needle aspiration of the fluid was performed. In this study, 13 cases of late seroma (8 augmentations and 5 reconstructions) were observed. The overall incidence of this complication was 1. 68 %. Chemical analyses confirmed the diagnosis of seroma, which recurred in all the patients within days of evacuation. For 12 patients, a reoperation was performed, during which the implant was removed, a total capsulectomy was performed, and in cases of subglandular breast augmentation, the implant pocket was changed to a submuscular placement before a new prosthesis was inserted. One patient underwent a second ultrasound-guided needle aspiration. No seroma recurrence was observed in any of the patients during the follow-up period. In case of unexpected breast enlargement after prosthesis implantation, the physician should first rule out infection, then investigate possible friction irritation from either a fold in the device or rubbing of a textured implant. According to the authors' experience and another report, this complication occurs in 1 % to 2 % of cases. The inclusion of this complication in the informed consent form should be considered.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{paper is}} a survey {{on the problem}} of {{traceability}} in healthcare. Traceability covers many different aspects and its understanding varies among different players. In supply chains and retails, traceability usually covers aspects pertaining to logistics. The challenge is to keep trace of objects manufactured, to track their locations in a production and distribution processes. In food industry, traceability has received a lot of attention because of public health problems related to infectious diseases. For instance, in Europe, the challenge of traceability has been to build the tracking of meat, from the living animal to the shell. In the health sector, traceability has mostly been involved in patient safety around human products such as blood derivates contaminants or implanted devices and prosthesis such as <b>mammary</b> <b>implants.</b> There are growing interests involving traceability in health related to drug safety, including the problem of counterfeited drugs, and to privacy. Traceability is also increasingly seen as a mean to improve efficiency of the logistics of care and a way to better understand costs and usage of resources. METHODS: This survey is reviewing the literature and proposes a discussion based on the real use and needs of traceability in a large teaching hospital. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Traceability in healthcare is at the crossroads of numerous needs. It is therefore of particular complexity and raises many new challenges. Identification management and entity tracking, from serialization of consumers' good production in the supply chains, to the identification of actors, patients, care providers, locations and processes is a huge effort, tackling economical, political, ethical and technical challenges. New requirements are needed, not usually met in the supply chain, such as serialization and persistence in time. New problems arise, such as privacy and legal frameworks. There are growing needs to increase traceability for drug products, related to drug safety, counterfeited drugs, and to privacy. Technical problems around reliability, robustness and efficiency of carriers are still to be resolved. There is a lot at stakes. Traceability is a major aspect of the future in healthcare and requires the attention of the community of medical informatics...|$|R

Biodistribution of doxorubicin to the cutaneous tissues of mice (skin and paws) and to orthotopically <b>implanted</b> <b>mammary</b> tu-mors (4 T 1) was examined. Weekly intravenous administration of pegylated (STEALTH) liposomal doxorubicin (SL-DXR) at {{a dose of}} 9 mg/kg (every week 4 doses) resulted in accumu-lation of doxorubicin in cutaneous tissues of mice and devel-opment of lesions resembling palmar-plantar erythrodysesthe-sia (PPE). Lengthening the dose interval to every 2 weeks 4 doses reduced the accumulation of doxorubicin and lowered the incidence of PPE-like lesions. A dose interval of every 4 weeks 4 resulted in complete clearance of doxorubicin fro...|$|R
40|$|Rapidly growing {{mycobacteria}} (RGM) are opportunistic microorganisms {{and widely}} distributed into aqueous environment and soil. Human RGM infections are {{usually associated with}} contaminated solutions or medical instruments used during invasive procedures. RGM postsurgical infections have recently emerged in Brazil and have caused national alert, considering the risk factors and epidemiological aspects. This study aimed at analysing the main factors linked to the recent RGM outbreaks, with focus on the national epidemic of Mycobacterium massiliense infections related to the BRA 100 strains resistant to 2 % glutaraldehyde commercial solutions commonly used for preoperative high-level disinfection. Based on previous studies and laboratorial results of assays and colaborations, {{it has been observed}} that the cases have been associated with videolaparoscopy for different applications and elective esthetic procedures, such as lipoaspiration and <b>mammary</b> prosthesis <b>implant.</b> Furthermore, outbreaks between 2004 and 2008 and the epidemic in Rio de Janeiro state may be considered particular Brazilian events. Although there are a few epidemiological published studies, some hypotheses based on common aspects related to most national nosocomial occurrences are possible, such as lack of protocols for cleaning and high-level disinfection, use of 2 % glutaraldehyde as high-level disinfectant for surgical instruments, and dissemination of M. massiliense BRA 100 by unknown mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Histological, {{haematological}} and immunocytochemical {{analyses were}} performed on a <b>mammary</b> adenocarcinoma <b>implanted</b> in Dark Agouti rats treated with LPS to further elucidate the role of TNF-alpha in tumour biology. Tumours were examined 4 – 12 days after implantation with parallel studies on rats treated with LPS (200 mug/ 100 g bodyweight [b. w. J) 24 h before removal. Tumour tissue from rats with 12 -day-old lesions was also examined over the 24 h period after LPS administration. Haemorrhagic necrosis was evident 6 h after endotoxin treatment and became profound by 24 hours, at which stage only a thin band of viable cells was seen at {{the rim of the}} tumour. Using immunocytochemical techniques and a monoclonal anti-macrophage antibody, macrophage numbers were seen to increase throughout the tumour following LPS administration at each stage of tumour growth. Immunocytochemical staining for intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM-I), an adhesion molecule normally involved in monocyte recruitment, could not be detected in vascular channels within the tumours investigated. However, subcutaneous vessels at the tumour periphery produced a strong linear reaction. The results show that macrophage numbers in tumours increase after LPS administration, concurrently with the development of haemorrhagic necrosis. This cellular infiltration was associated with peripheral monocytopenia. ICAM-I expression on the vascular endothelium within tumours was deficient...|$|R
