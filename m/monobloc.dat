25|$|Early {{production}} guns had a built-up barrel, {{but later}} ones used a <b>monobloc.</b> There were {{problems with the}} breech mechanism early in the production run {{and a number of}} the first year's production run lacked the semi-automatic breech entirely.|$|E
25|$|In 1898, de Dietrich debuted the Torpilleur (Torpedo) racer, which {{featured}} a four-cylinder engine and independent suspension in front, for the Paris-Amsterdam Trial; Gaudry wrecked en route, but still placed third. The response was substantial, exceeding one million gold francs. The 1899 torpilleur was less successful, despite underslung chassis, a rear-mounted <b>monobloc</b> four, and twin carburettors; poor preparation left {{none of the}} works teams able to complete the Tour de France.|$|E
25|$|The Lynx is a {{multi-purpose}} twin-engine battlefield helicopter, {{of which}} specialized versions {{have been developed}} for both sea and land-based warfare. A distinguishing feature between early and later aircraft is the undercarriage: early Army versions of the Lynx were equipped with skids, while the Naval and later models have been outfitted with wheels, a requirement for easy ground handling on the deck of a warship. Early versions of the Lynx were powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce Gem turboshaft engines, which powered a four-blade rotor. Mounted on a rigid titanium <b>monobloc</b> rotor head of the kind pioneered by the MBB BO105 a few years earlier. The innovative blade design comprised a honeycomb sandwich structure and made out of composite material. For shipboard stowage, both the rotor blades and tail can be folded. Lag dampers were incorporated but these are not required in flight (owing to the rigidity of the <b>monobloc</b> rotor head). In flight, the main rotor is kept at a constant speed, simplifying aircraft control; the rotor also features a vibration absorption system.|$|E
50|$|Honda {{produces}} {{many other}} head-block-crankcase <b>monoblocs</b> under {{a variety of}} different names, such as the GXV-series. They may all be externally identified by a gasket which would bisect the crankshaft on an approximately 45° angle.|$|R
50|$|The last of {{the sealed}} {{anamorphic}} <b>monoblocs,</b> the 2005 was built out of the cheap I.O.R.-made second iteration of the Pentacon Prakticar 50mm 2.4 pancake lens. The Iscorama 2005 was multicoated and had a Praktica B Mount.|$|R
50|$|Final {{sale price}} auction data {{indicate}} that the Iscorama 54 and original 1960s Iscorama are the most valuable of the true DSLR compatible Iscoramas (the projector lenses are worth relatively little), whilst the 2000 series sealed <b>monoblocs</b> fetch the least at auction.|$|R
25|$|Bi-block (or twinblock) ties {{consist of}} two {{concrete}} rail supports {{joined by a}} steel bar. Advantages include increased lateral resistance and lower weight than <b>monobloc</b> concrete ties, as well as elimination of damage from torsional forces on the ties center due the more flexible steel connections. This tie type is in common use in France, and are used on the high-speed TGV lines. Bi-block ties are also used in ballastless track systems.|$|E
25|$|The Veyron's brakes use cross drilled, {{radially}} vented {{carbon fibre}} reinforced silicon carbide (C/SiC) composite discs, manufactured by SGL Carbon, {{which have a}} much greater resistance to brake fade when compared with conventional cast iron discs. The lightweight aluminium alloy <b>monobloc</b> brake calipers are made by AP Racing; the fronts have eight titanium pistons and the rear calipers have six pistons. Bugatti claims maximum deceleration of 1.3g on road tyres. As an added safety feature, {{in the event of}} brake failure, an anti-lock braking system (ABS) has also been installed on the handbrake.|$|E
25|$|The {{acetabular}} cup is {{the component}} which is placed into the acetabulum (hip socket). Cartilage and bone {{are removed from}} the acetabulum and the acetabular cup is attached using friction or cement. Some acetabular cups are one piece, while others are modular. One-piece (<b>monobloc)</b> shells are either UHMWPE (ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene) or metal, they have their articular surface machined on the inside surface of the cup and do not rely on a locking mechanism to hold a liner in place. A <b>monobloc</b> polyethylene cup is cemented in place while a metal cup is {{held in place by}} a metal coating {{on the outside of the}} cup. Modular cups consist of two pieces, a shell and liner. The shell is made of metal; the outside has a porous coating while the inside contains a locking mechanism designed to accept a liner. Two types of porous coating used to form a friction fit are sintered beads and a foam metal design to mimic the trabeculae of cancellous bone and initial stability is influenced by under-reaming and insertion force. Permanent fixation is achieved as bone grows onto or into the porous coating. Screws can be used to lag the shell to the bone providing even more fixation. Polyethylene liners are placed into the shell and connected by a rim locking mechanism; ceramic and metal liners are attached with a Morse taper.|$|E
5000|$|A 322 cuin L [...] "monobloc" [...] {{engine was}} used in 1936's Series 60. It was {{designed}} to be the company's next-generation powerplant at reduced cost from the 353 and Cadillac V12. The <b>monobloc's</b> cylinders and crankcase were cast as a single unit, [...] and it used hydraulic valve lifters for durability. This design allowed the creation of the mid-priced Series 60 line.|$|R
5000|$|The company {{originated}} {{as a small}} {{hardware store}} in Palam, Delhi in May, 1984 by brothers Avinash and Amit Jain and was then known as [...] "Jain Brothers". Arise established its first manufacturing workshop in 1992 in Sonipat, Haryana. It specializes in <b>monoblocs</b> and submersibles pump sets and batteries. Another unit at Kala Amb, Himachal Pradesh manufactures UPS systems, inverters and gas and electric geysers.|$|R
5000|$|Launched in 1996, the Scoot'elec {{was based}} on the Zenith, with which it shares body panels and {{suspension}} parts. It is powered by a [...] DC motor fed from three Saft nickel-cadmium <b>monoblocs</b> giving an 18 V, 100 A·h battery. Built around a [...] "double cradle", the frame holds the batteries low down between and behind the rider's feet, providing a very low centre of gravity. The electronic controller and onboard charger are housed under the seat.|$|R
25|$|The T-3 was {{the third}} {{in the line of}} 'T' (Tornado) series engines {{developed}} by Wright Aeronautical on the lines of the Wright-Hisso engines produced during the First World War using <b>monobloc</b> cylinder blocks and gear driven overhead camshafts. The T-1 of 1921 had a power output of 500hp (373kW), and went into production as the T-2 in 1922 with an increase in power to 525hp (391kW). The T-3 and T-3A appeared from 1923 producing 575hp (429kW) with the final development, the T-4, producing 675hp (503kW) by December of that year. Wright attempted to build a racing version of the T rated at 700hp (522kW) to rival the Curtiss D-12, but this was not pursued.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the German {{practice}} of sliding block breeches {{that required a}} metallic cartridge case to seal the gun's chamber against combustion gases, Škoda preferred to use an interrupted screw breech with a deBange obdurator to seal the chamber. This lowered the rate of fire, but had the great economic advantage of allowing bagged propellant charges that didn't use scarce brass or steel cartridge case when those metals were in short supply. The other unusual feature of the gun was that it used a <b>monobloc</b> auto-frettaged barrel. This was {{a single piece of}} steel that was radially expanded under hydraulic pressure. This had the advantage of placing the steel of the barrel under compression, which helped it resist the stresses of firing and was simpler and faster to build since the barrel didn't require assembly as with more traditional construction techniques.|$|E
2500|$|Aviation {{reporter}} and author Harry Harper, who had witnessed Latham's career from his cross-Channel attempts {{to the failure}} of the <b>Monobloc</b> at the French military trials two years later, wrote the following about Hubert Latham in his final book, published in 1956: ...|$|E
50|$|The Look 596 is {{constructed}} from high modulus carbon fibre, where aerodynamic efficiency {{was the top}} priority during the design phase. Each tube which makes up the frame is positioned to optimise airflow between the rider and the bike, with a claimed improvement in aerodynamic efficiency of 10%. The aerodynamics (and rigidity) of the bike were achieved by integration of the bottom bracket into the downtube, in one continuous piece. Like the track variant the 596 is constricted from three <b>monoblocs.</b> The front fork also acts as a fairing.|$|R
40|$|Several nonintrusive, {{continuous}} battery monitoring {{devices for}} lead-acid batteries in standby applications, such as uninterruptible power systems (UPS), are available {{today on the}} market. Some of them are using impedance measurements on every bloc of a battery string for determining the state of health of each bloc. The paper will present {{the results of an}} extensive validation test, comparing the results provided on the one hand by low cost monitoring devices {{and on the other hand}} by a full scale, laboratory impedance spectroscope. For the validation tests, accelerated ageing on many different lead-acid battery products have been performed. The batteries vary in terms of size (Ah), bloc voltage, battery brands and technologies. The targeted standby applications often use large batteries consisting of many single cells or <b>monoblocs</b> with six or twelve volts each connected in series. These batteries grow old during their utilization and show several ageing phenomena, which could lead to a reduced bridging time and, therefore, unforeseen failure of the system connected to the UPS in case of blackout. Nonhomogenous ageing of the cells or <b>monoblocs</b> is much more the normal case than homogenous ageing of all elements. The scope of the investigation is a detailed analysis on impedance as a measure for the ageing. The aim is to qualify devices and procedures for the use in UPS systems and to understand, in detail, which ageing effects can be detected at which frequencies. A low cost monitoring system has been evaluated with regard to its performance to make use of the information...|$|R
40|$|Resilon {{broadens}} {{the dimensions}} of endodontic adhesion by introducing the possibility of creating <b>monoblocs</b> between root canal filling materials and intraradicular dentin by using methacrylate-based sealers. The adhesive strength of Resilon to RealSeal, a methacrylate-based root canal sealer, was evaluated using a modified microshear bond testing design. Flat Resilon surfaces with different roughness were created for bonding to the sealer and compared to a composite control. The composite control exhibited mean shear strength 7. 3 to 26. 9 times {{higher than those of}} the Resilon groups. Shear strength differences among the Resilon groups of different surface roughness highlighted the contribution of micromechanical versus chemical coupling in sealer retention. Ultrastructural evidence of phase separation of polymeric components in Resilon suggested that the amount of dimethacrylate incorporated into this filled, thermoplastic composite may not yet be optimized for effective chemical coupling to methacrylate-based sealers...|$|R

2500|$|The 50-caliber Mle 1929 was a {{lengthened}} {{version of}} the Modèle 1927. It used the semi-automatic action of the older gun {{as well as its}} horizontal sliding block breech. It had an autofretted <b>monobloc</b> barrel as well. It weighed , but the later Modèle 1934 weighed [...] for some reason, but appears to have been otherwise identical.|$|E
2500|$|The era {{also saw}} the first use of {{monocoque}} construction, first seen in Eugene Ruchonnet's Aero-Cigare and notably used in the Deperdussin Monocoque of 1912, which won the Gordon Bennett race in both 1912 and 1913. [...] Another structurally advanced and influential (although unsuccessful) aircraft was the Antoinette <b>Monobloc,</b> {{which was the first}} monoplane to have a cantilever wing without any external bracing wires.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this pilot}} study was to determine, in a new {{experimental}} model, whether complex bioartificial <b>monoblocs</b> of relevant size and stability can be prefabricated in a defined three-dimensional design, in which the latissimus dorsi muscle serves as a natural bioreactor and the thoracodorsal vessel tree is prepared for axial construct perfusion. Eighteen sheep {{were included in the}} study, with six animals in each of three experimental groups. Vitalization of the β-tricalcium phosphate-based constructs was performed by direct application of unmodified osteogenic material from the iliac crest (group A), in vivo application of nucleated cell concentrate (NCC) from bone marrow aspirate (group B), and in vitro cultivation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) in a perfusion bioreactor system (group C). The contours of the constructs were designed digitally and transferred onto the bioartificial bone grafts using a titanium cage, which was bent over a stereolithographic model of the defined subvolume intraoperatively. At the end of the prefabrication process, only the axial vascularized constructs of group A demonstrated vital bone formation with considerable stability. In groups B and C, the applied techniques were not able to induce ectopic bone formation. The presented computer-assisted workflow allows the prefabrication of custom-made bioartificial transplants...|$|R
2500|$|Meanwhile, the Packard One-Twenty {{had been}} {{introduced}} in 1935, and had taken off like a rocket. Additional competition from the Lincoln-Zephyr, introduced in 1936, did not help, either. For 1937, Cadillac made the LaSalle its own again, giving it the [...] <b>monobloc</b> V8 of the Series 60, new styling, a lower price range, and a heavy promotion, emphasizing the car was completely Cadillac built. It was too late. Model year sales of 32,000 LaSalles was a terrific leap forward, but remained leagues behind the junior Packard.|$|E
2500|$|An {{electric}} power steering rack with a 14.3:1 gear ratio is used. The front suspension utilizes a double-wishbone arrangement {{and there is a}} multi-link arrangement at the rear with coil-over dampers at all wheels. The dampers are a monotube design, each with a remote fluid reservoir that includes an expanding and contracting bellows: a purely mechanical system. The LFA further features six-piston front and four-piston rear Brembo <b>monobloc</b> brake calipers with [...] front and [...] rear carbon ceramic discs controlled by Toyota's Electronically Controlled Brake brake-by-wire system. Forged 20-inch BBS wheels fitted with [...] front and [...] rear Bridgestone next-generation Potenza tires are standard.

2500|$|The 1913 six-cylinder {{models were}} the first cars to employ the {{important}} advancement of <b>monobloc</b> engine casting which became associated with a production-economy drive in {{the years of the}} war. At that time, a 28-year-old university graduate engineer, Fred M. Zeder, was appointed chief engineer. He was the first of a trio of brilliant technicians, with Owen R. Skelton and Carl Breer, who launched the successful 1918 models, and were known as [...] "The Three Musketeers". They left in 1920 to form a consultancy, later to become the nucleus of Chrysler Engineering. The replacement chief engineer was Guy P. Henry, who introduced molybdenum steel, an improved clutch design, and presided over the six-cylinders-only policy favored by new president Albert Russel Erskine who replaced Fred Fish in July 1915.|$|E
2500|$|The USAAC was {{interested}} in very large bomber designs, and in engines that could be buried in the wings {{in order to improve}} streamlining. [...] From this requirement they designed a 12-cylinder horizontally opposed engine using twelve separate [...] "hyper" [...] cylinders. [...] Although this sort of arrangement, with entirely separate cylinders from each other and the crankcase, was common for liquid-cooled Central Powers World War I-era inline-6 aviation engines, as in the German Mercedes D.III of nearly two decades earlier - and had been used for the 1918-era Allied Liberty L-12 liquid-cooled aviation engine with significant success - it had fallen from use in favor of engines featuring a <b>monobloc</b> engine design philosophy, with a cylinder block that combined the cylinders and the crankcase, leading to much stiffer engines, that were better able to handle increased power.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the autumn}} of 1911, Levavasseur had {{completed}} building an aeroplane known as the <b>Monobloc</b> or Antoinette blindé (Fr. 'armoured') that was engineered and designed {{in accordance with the}} French Ministry of War's requirements. It was entered in the military trials staged at Reims in October 1911 to compete with 10 other entries from as many companies. [...] Levavasseur insisted that Latham would be the pilot. Unfortunately, in the rush to have his aeroplane built in time to enter the trials, Levavasseur never had the chance to test it. [...] The result was that the aeroplane failed to get airborne despite two attempts by Latham because Levavasseur did not have a powerful enough motor that could cope with the significant weight of the aircraft. [...] The Monobloc's failure and subsequent loss of a potentially lucrative government contract was the final blow to the Antoinette company which folded the next month.|$|E
50|$|The last {{engines to}} make {{widespread}} use of <b>monobloc</b> cylinder heads were large air-cooled aircraft radial engines, such as the Wasp Major. These have individual cylinder barrels, so access as a <b>monobloc</b> is less restricted than on inline engine. As they are also of high specific power and require the utmost reliability, {{the advantages of the}} <b>monobloc</b> remained attractive.|$|E
50|$|In most cases, any use of {{the term}} {{describes}} a deliberate single-unit construction, opposed to the more common contemporary practice. Where the <b>monobloc</b> technique has later become the norm, the specific term falls from favour. It is now usual and un-noteworthy practice to use <b>monobloc</b> cylinders and crankcases, but a <b>monobloc</b> head (for a water-cooled inline engine at least) would be regarded as peculiar and obsolescent.|$|E
5000|$|The {{communal}} {{water jacket}} of <b>monobloc</b> designs permitted closer spacing between cylinders. The <b>monobloc</b> design also improved the mechanical stiffness {{of the engine}} against bending and the increasingly important torsional twist, as cylinder numbers, engine lengths, and power ratings increased.|$|E
5000|$|... 1982 saw the {{addition}} of the Iscorama 42 to the range, and in the early 1990s, ISCO introduced a new series of sealed <b>monobloc</b> 50mm focal length anamorphic lenses, plus a pair of matching anamorphic projector lenses, all under the Iscorama brand.

50|$|An {{alternative}} solution was the <b>monobloc</b> engine, where {{the block and}} head were formed as one piece. This solved the sealing problem, but complicated manufacture and maintenance. Particularly when routine maintenance still required frequent head removal for de-coking, on a <b>monobloc</b> engine this required {{the removal of the}} pistons from the crankshaft end beneath.|$|E
5000|$|A {{cylinder}} block is a unit comprising several cylinders (including their cylinder walls, coolant passages, cylinder sleeves if any, and so forth). In the earliest decades of {{internal combustion engine}} development, <b>monobloc</b> cylinder construction was rare; cylinders were usually cast individually. Combining their castings into pairs or triples was an early win of <b>monobloc</b> design.|$|E
