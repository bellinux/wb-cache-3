40|$|Replacing {{expensive}} silver with inexpensive copper for the metallisation {{of silicon}} wafer solar cells {{can lead to}} substantial reductions in material costs associated with cell production. Copper metallisation is especially applicable to hydrogenated amorphous/crystalline silicon heterojunction cells since the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer in such cells is expected to provide an adequate barrier to prevent cell degrading copper diffusion into silicon. For copper plating on heterojunction cells {{it is necessary to}} mask the TCO surface to define the grid electrode. In this paper we investigate screen-printed masking of TCO surfaces to define copper-plated electrodes of heterojunction cells. A <b>masking</b> <b>process</b> is developed and various masking and plating aspects are evaluated. The focus of these investigations is on the characterisation of metal-TCO interfaces and on determining the influence of textured silicon wafer surfaces on the <b>masking</b> <b>process.</b> As a proof of concept, heterojunction cells are fabricated with copper-plated front contacts defined by screen-printed TCO masking.

40|$|The Leu 3 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{regulates the}} {{transcription}} of genes involved in branched-chain {{amino acid biosynthesis}} and in ammonia assimilation. Leu 3 p can either activate or repress gene transcription depending on the intracellular level of α-isopropylmalate, an intermediate of the leucine biosynthesis pathway. This functional control process is called modulation. Leu 3 p modulates its function through masking/unmasking its activation domain. The observation that Leu 3 p retains its modulation properties even when expressed in mammalian cells suggests that this process requires no participation of auxiliary factors. This thesis addresses the molecular mechanism of the activation domain <b>masking</b> <b>process.</b> Characterization of an activation domain mutant (D 872 N/D 874 N), designated Leu 3 -dd, shows {{that it is an}} inactive molecule because its activation domain is permanently masked. A modified yeast two hybrid experiment demonstrates that the activation domain indeed interacts with another portion of Leu 3 p. Experiments of domain swapping between Leu 3 p and Cha 4 p (another yeast transcription factor involved in serine/threonine degradation) further delimits the activation domain masking region to the middle region of Leu 3 p, and indicates that the masking interactions between the activation domain and the middle region are highly specific. To identify the key residues involved in activation domain masking, the phenotype of Leu 3 -dd containing cells (very slow growth on SD plates) was used to select for suppressor mutations in the middle region. Eight amino acids are identified and allocated in a relatively small region. When anyone of them is mutated, the activation domain masking interactions between the activation domain and the middle region are essentially abolished, and the mutant Leu 3 p behaves as a “constitutively” active molecule. Finally, it is demonstrated that in vivo Leu 3 p can be modulated by its own concentration, suggesting a second mechanism to regulate the activation domain <b>masking</b> <b>process.</b> ...|$|E
