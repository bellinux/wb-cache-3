500|$|According to its specifications, the Links' Wi-Fi {{will cover}} a radius of 150 feet (46 m) [...] to 400 feet (120 m). The Links' Wi-Fi {{is capable of}} running at 1 gigabit per second or 1000 megabits per second, [...] more than 100 {{times faster than the}} 8.7 <b>megabit</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> speed of the average public Wi-Fi network in the United States. The fast speeds make LinkNYC only gigabit-speed {{internet}} service provider in North America. LinkNYC's routers have neither a bandwidth cap nor a time limit for usage, meaning that users can use LinkNYC Wi-Fi {{for as long as they}} need to. The free phone calls are also available for unlimited use. The network is only intended for use in public spaces, though this may be subject to change in the future. In the future, the LinkNYC network could also be used to [...] "connect lighting systems, smart meters, traffic networks, connected cameras and other IoT systems," [...] as well as for utility monitoring and for 5G installations.|$|E

50|$|Assuming equal {{operating}} parameters to an 802.11g network achieving 54 <b>megabits</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (on a single 20 MHz channel with one antenna), an 802.11n network can achieve 72 <b>megabits</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (on a single 20 MHz channel with one antenna and 400 ns guard interval); 802.11n's speed may {{go up to}} 150 <b>megabits</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> if there aren't other Bluetooth, microwave or Wi-Fi emissions in the neighborhood by using two 20 MHz channels in 40 MHz mode. If more antennas are used, then 802.11n can go up to 288 <b>megabits</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> in 20 MHz mode with four antennas, or 600 <b>megabits</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> in 40 MHz mode with four antennas and 400 ns guard interval. Because the 2.4 GHz band is seriously congested in most urban areas, 802.11n networks usually have more success in increasing data rate by utilizing more antennas in 20 MHz mode rather than by operating in the 40 MHz mode, as the 40 MHz mode requires a relatively free radio spectrum which is only available in rural areas away from cities. Thus, network engineers installing an 802.11n network should strive to select routers and wireless clients with the most antennas possible (one, two, three or four as specified by the 802.11n standard) {{and try to make}} sure that the network's bandwidth will be satisfactory even on the 20 MHz mode.|$|R

Demand priority shifts {{network access control}} from the workstation to a hub. This access method works with a star topology.In this method, a node that wishes to transmit indicates this wish to the hub and also requests high- or regular-priority service for its transmission. After it obtains permission, the node begins transmitting to the hub.|$|E
