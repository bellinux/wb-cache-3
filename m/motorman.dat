5|$|On August 23, 1954, a D train {{relaying}} east of {{the station}} overshot the bumper blocks {{at the end of}} the track, crashing into the wall {{at the end of the}} line. The train <b>motorman</b> was trapped in the tunnel for seven hours, and when he was freed, his left foot had to be amputated.|$|E
5|$|The trams are bidirectional, with a driver's cab at each end. These cabs {{are built}} so the <b>motorman</b> can also sell tickets. The cab's have {{a door to}} close them off, so the riders cannot access rear cab. There are four doors on both sides; the front door is single while the three back doors are double. In {{addition}} to the front door, there is one door in each section. To operate the doors on the left side, the <b>motorman</b> must engage a security switch. It is also possible to open each individual door {{on the right side}} from the driver's cab. Half the length is low-floor, with an entry height at , including three of the four doors. There are 88 seats, of which 64 are on the high-floor section, giving a total capacity of 212 riders.|$|E
5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of January 4, 1962, the three-car automated train began service, with a ceremony. The trains carried a stand-by <b>motorman</b> during the six-month trial period. The train had scheduled to begin service on December 15, 1961, but Quill threatened to strike all city- and private-owned transit in the city if the train ran. Under the new contract with the TWU, the NYCTA agreed to put a <b>motorman</b> in the train during the experimental period. While in its experimental period, the automated train was only operating during rush hours. In July, the test was extended for three more months, and in October the test was extended for six additional months. The chairman of the NYCTA, Charles Patterson, was disappointed by the automated shuttle train, doubting that the train could be operated without any transit personnel on board. Initially, the automation of the shuttle was expected to save $150,000 a year in labor costs; however, with one employee still required on the train, there would essentially be no savings. If the test succeeded, it was planned to automate the IRT Flushing Line, the Franklin Avenue Shuttle, and the Culver Shuttle. However, the NYCTA did not have plans to automate the whole system.|$|E
50|$|Moreover, the <b>motormen,</b> until 1962, {{were mostly}} from Moscow, {{as there was}} no {{institution}} that provided appropriate education in Ukraine. There were some railway engineers employed at first from Kiev, such as one that opened the underground, {{even though they had}} to qualify for <b>motormen</b> in Moscow.|$|R

25|$|On December 16, 1957 another {{representation}} {{election for}} the TWU was scheduled, and the <b>motormen</b> from the MBA {{did not want}} to have a small role in the TWU, and threatened to strike, but were stopped by court injunctions. As a result, the <b>motormen</b> wanted to hold an election for the representation of their craft independent of the NYCTA-wide elections. The management of the NYCTA did not recognize the MTA as a bargaining unit as the TWU officially represented the <b>motormen.</b> A request for a separate election was denied, and as a result the <b>motormen</b> wanted to show their power and to acquire their own representation. As a result, on December 9, 1957, the <b>motormen</b> went on strike, resulting in subway service being reduced in half for eight days. Riders using the IND lines in Queens, the Bronx, and Upper Manhattan, and the southern Brooklyn lines of the BMT were the hardest hit. The leaders of the MBA were punished after going against injunctions prohibiting strikes. Afterwards, the MBA leaders were punished, and on the first morning of the strike, the MBA President Theodore Loos and three other MBA officials were arrested and sent to jail. In 1958, the TWU and the MBA reached a settlement. The <b>motormen</b> became a separate United Motormen's Division within the TWU and benefitted from a fund for skilled craft workers. Theodore Loos became its head.|$|R
5|$|A severe {{fire at the}} Grand Central {{station on}} April 21, 1964, {{destroyed}} the demonstration train and manual operation had been restored since. The fire began under a shuttle train on track 3, and it became larger, feeding on the wooden platform. The train on Track 1 was saved when the <b>motorman</b> saw smoke, and reversed the train. The basements of nearby buildings were damaged. Tracks 1 and 4 returned to service on April 23, 1964, while Track 3 returned to service on June 1, 1964. The reinstallation of Track 3 was delayed {{because of the need}} to replace 60 beams that were damaged in the fire. Initially, a decision was not made concerning whether or not the automated shuttle train should be reintroduced.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, Dean applied to the US Military Academy, but was rejected. He then tried to enlist in the United States Army during World War I, {{but he was too}} young to do so without his parents' permission, and his mother refused. Dean instead {{attended}} University of California at Berkeley studying pre-law. During this time, he also took a variety of side jobs, including a stevedore at the San Francisco docks, a <b>motorman,</b> and briefly as a patrolman for the Berkeley Police Department, where he worked under police chief August Vollmer. Dean originally sought to attain a Doctor of Law degree but only completed a Bachelor of Arts degree from Berkeley in 1922 before joining the Army.|$|E
5|$|The Østensjø Line {{became part}} of the Oslo Metro in 1967, and several of the Class E trams were {{transferred}} {{to other parts of the}} tramway. However, the Lilleaker Line was instead tied to the Ekeberg Line on the east side of the city, and the trams started operating on the Jar–Ljabru service. After the last bus route had been converted to one-man operation and the conductor replaced with a ticket-selling <b>motorman,</b> Oslo Sporveier started the process of converting their tram fleet. No. 176 was converted as a trial, and after 1971, all the remaining Gullfisks were converted. Because the trams had been delivered with a single front door, the cost of converting the trams was very little, and the single-manning highly profitable.|$|E

5|$|During 1997, {{there were}} five {{incidents}} where NSB's Nordic Mobile Telephone equipment interfered with the locomotive's electronics, causing the emergency brakes to activate. This caused a temporary halt until the <b>motorman</b> had unlocked the brakes. The problem was fixed by moving NSB's mobile senders. The units were taken into use on the Bergen Line from 5 January 1997. Later they entered into use on the Dovre and Sørland Lines, and then on regional trains around Oslo, such as the Vestfold Line. In August 1998, NSB stated that El 18 used more power {{than some of the}} substation transformers along the line could handle, particularly along the Vestfold Line. Part of the problem was caused by a mechanism in the locomotives whereby the motor was turned off if the wheels spin. The result was that the full power output of the El 18 along parts of the railway network could not be utilized.|$|E
5|$|To {{replace the}} aging Class C trains, from 1985 to 1987, ten T4s were {{converted}} to T1300. They were equipped with a pantograph, received a new front and the doors were moved. Six additional T4s were converted in 1989, and given the designation T8. These only had the pantographs equipped and kept the same front and door arrangement. With {{the introduction of the}} T1300, the western lines could remove the conductor and have single-manned trains with the <b>motorman</b> selling tickets. The T1300-units have had better regularity than the older models they replaced. However, because they are designed for a closed system with automatic train protection, the braking systems are not sufficiently dimensioned for when the drivers use line of sight to regulate the speed and distances between trains. The 1300 units were numbered 1301–1349. After the conversions, Oslo Sporveier operated 49 T1300-cars and 146 T1000-cars. The trains were originally painted red with a beige cheatline.|$|E

50|$|The term {{refers to}} the person {{who is in charge of}} the motor (of the {{electric}} car) in the same sense as a railroad engineer is in charge of the engine. The term was (and, where still used, is) gender-neutral. Though <b>motormen</b> have historically been male, females in the position (such as in the United States during the World Wars) were usually also called <b>motormen</b> as a job title.|$|R
25|$|Additionally, {{like all}} of the old high voltage equipment, the cars {{featured}} a ten point brass controller with manual acceleration, which required motormen to notch up gradually as the train came up to speed. Should a <b>motorman</b> advance too quickly with the controller handle, however, a device would actually prevent the car's propulsion system from notching up at too rapid a rate. Mounted {{on the top of}} the controller handle was a button which had to be depressed at all times, acting as a deadman's switch, which would automatically apply the train's emergency brakes should the <b>motorman</b> let go. This was a safety feature designed to stop a train should a <b>motorman</b> become incapacitated. Variations of a deadman's switch, or deadman's device, have been used continuously since and are still used on all current New York City Subway rolling stock.|$|E
