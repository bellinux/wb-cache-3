25|$|Macneil's work {{is often}} {{considered}} inaccessible {{and difficult to}} read. And Macneil himself has expressed some disappointment at the reception of the work among legal scholars: 'I have now had over a decade to accept that {{there had never been}} any race to a relational theory of contract, nor have the succeeding years seen either widespread acceptance of (or indeed much challenge to) <b>my</b> <b>particular</b> theory or the development of other relational theories.' However, the Northwestern symposium and other more recent work goes some way to correcting that omission. In particular, David Campbell has published an edited collection of Macneil's relational contract theory work. Macneil's work in particular has also been discussed by Richard Austen-Baker, who relates Macneil's system of norms to English contract law doctrine, and used Macneil's theory to discuss the need or otherwise of further regulation of consumer contracts.|$|E

[...] In a 2008 interview, he stated that he believed education was [...] "investment in the future—an investment in human capital. I've been active {{in a range of}} other things, but education's always been <b>my</b> <b>particular</b> love".|$|E
500|$|Several of the show's crew praise Bumpass for his {{performance}} and similitude to the character. Kenny called Bumpass [...] "brilliant" [...] and said, [...] " [...] {{is sort of}} like Squidward". Staff writer Kent Osborne said, [...] "I remember thinking about how much Rodger talks and acts like Squidward. That's why it's such a good voice—he's so connected to it". However, Bumpass said, [...] "I'm not him and he's not me, but what I'm required to do for him and what I am enabled to do for him is what makes it like me. It fits <b>my</b> <b>particular</b> talents and skills very well. So in that respect, yeah, he is me, but I am not the cranky, sarcastic, underachieving kind of guy that he is. He's easy to fall in, I will say that." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1899, that {{prediction}} suddenly came true. At {{the age of}} forty-two, Elgar {{produced the}} Enigma Variations, which were premiered in London under the baton of the eminent German conductor Hans Richter. In Elgar's own words, [...] "I have sketched a set of Variations on an original theme. The Variations have amused me because I've labelled them with the nicknames of <b>my</b> <b>particular</b> friends ... {{that is to say}} I've written the variations each one to represent the mood of the 'party' (the person) ... and have written what I think they would have written – if they were asses enough to compose". He dedicated the work [...] "To my friends pictured within". Probably the best known variation is [...] "Nimrod", depicting Jaeger. Purely musical considerations led Elgar to omit variations depicting Arthur Sullivan and Hubert Parry, whose styles he tried but failed to incorporate in the variations. The large-scale work was received with general acclaim for its originality, charm and craftsmanship, and it established Elgar as the pre-eminent British composer of his generation.|$|E
500|$|In 1803, after a {{succession}} of commands, Heywood was promoted to post-captain. In command of , Heywood {{conducted a series of}} surveys of the eastern coasts of Ceylon and India, areas that had not been studied previously, and produced what Alexander describes as [...] "beautifully drafted charts". In later years he was to produce similar charts for the north coast of Morocco, the River Plate area of South America, parts of the coasts of Sumatra and north-west Australia, and other channels and coastlines. His skill in this area may well have developed from Bligh's tutelage in the earlier stages of the Bounty voyage. Bligh, an accomplished draughtsman, had written of Christian and Heywood: [...] "These two had been objects of <b>my</b> <b>particular</b> regard and attention, and I had taken great pains to instruct them." [...] James Horsburgh, who was hydrographer to the East India Company, wrote that Heywood's work had [...] "essentially contributed to making my Sailing Directory for the Indian navigation much more perfect than it would otherwise have been." [...] The extent of Heywood's professional reputation was demonstrated when the position of Admiralty Hydrographer was offered to him in 1818, after he had retired from the sea. He declined, and the appointment went to Francis Beaufort on Heywood's recommendation.|$|E
500|$|The {{first part}} of the novel {{establishes}} Yolanda at the centre of the story as she narrates the opening and closing chapter: [...] "Antojos" [...] and [...] "The Rudy Elmenhurst Story", respectively. In third person, Yolanda's return to Dominican Republic as an adult is described {{in the context of a}} family birthday party and a road trip. Their unity as sisters as [...] "The Four Girls" [...] is introduced in the third chapter, which is a communally narrated. They celebrate Carlos, the patriarch's, birthday, and Sofía introduces her baby son to his grandfather, helping to repair the father and daughter's relationship somewhat. [...] During Sofía's chapter, [...] "The Kiss", it is revealed that Carlos discovered a packet of love letters addressed to his daughter, enraging him and leading to a conflict which ends in Sofía running away to her German lover. [...] A major focus in this section is the romantic relationships between the four sisters and their partners. Sofía is married to a [...] "world-class chemist"; Carla and Sandra are in long-term relationships; and Yolanda is in love with her psychiatrist and has previously broken up with a man named John. Part I closes with [...] "The Rudy Elmenhurst Story", narrated by Yolanda. This describes Yolanda's first real relationship, and the tension between her upbringing and American relationships: [...] "I would never find someone who would understand <b>my</b> <b>particular</b> mix of Catholicism and agnosticism, Hispanic and American styles." ...|$|E

She {{suffered}} a miscarriage during her marriage to Gallagher, and the couple were childless. Asked about children in an October 2000 interview, Pleshette stated: [...] "I certainly {{would have liked to}} have had Tommy’s children. But my nurturing instincts are fulfilled in other ways. I have a large extended family; I'm the mother on every set. So if this is <b>my</b> <b>particular</b> karma, that's fine." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Plummer said of {{the film}} and his role that he was [...] "...a bit bored with the character. Although we worked hard {{enough to make him}} interesting, it was a bit like {{flogging}} a dead horse. And the subject matter is not mine. I mean, it can't appeal to every person in the world." [...] However, Plummer admits the film itself was well made and, despite his reservations, is proud to be associated with a film with such mass appeal. [...] "The world has seen [...] so many times. And there's a whole new generation every year—poor kids—that have to sit through it [...] But it was a very well-made movie, and it's a family movie and we haven't seen a family movie, I don't think, on that scale for ages. I don't mind that. It just happened to be not <b>my</b> <b>particular</b> cup of tea." [...] His singing voice was mostly dubbed by Bill Lee.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout {{the early}} 1990s, Blackwell {{remained}} active in performances with opera companies throughout the United States and Europe. Most notably, in 1994 Blackwell replaced Kathleen Battle as Marie in La fille du régiment at the Metropolitan Opera {{for the entire}} run when Battle was fired from the production for unprofessional conduct. This has inevitably caused critics to compare the two singers, and indeed both women have played {{many of the same}} roles and share a similar vocal quality. In a 2003 interview Blackwell said, [...] "Kathleen has been very supportive and very good to me over my career. Mattiwilda Dobbs, Reri Grist and Kathy were basically the predecessors for me and I really am grateful to those women, especially with <b>my</b> <b>particular</b> fach. I mean, singing Aïda or Leonora is one thing, but the lyric repertory roles are not star vehicles. It just doesn't happen and I think these women have really helped in that respect." ...|$|E
