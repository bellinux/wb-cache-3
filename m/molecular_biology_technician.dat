25|$|<b>Molecular</b> <b>biology</b> is {{the study}} of {{molecular}} underpinnings of the process of replication, transcription and translation of the genetic material. The central dogma of <b>molecular</b> <b>biology</b> where genetic material is transcribed into RNA and then translated into protein, despite being an oversimplified picture of <b>molecular</b> <b>biology,</b> still provides a good starting point for understanding the field.

40|$|<b>Molecular</b> <b>biology</b> {{has evolved}} {{far beyond that}} {{which could have been}} {{predicted}} at the time DNA identity testing was established. Indeed we should now perhaps be referring to forensic <b>molecular</b> <b>biology.</b> Aside from DNA’s established role in identifying the who in crime investigations, other developments in medical and developmental <b>molecular</b> <b>biology</b> are now ripe for application to forensic challenges. The impact of DNA methylation and other post-fertilization DNA modifications, plus the emerging role of small RNAs in the control of gene expression, is re-writing our understanding of human biology. It is apparent that these emerging technologies will expand forensic <b>molecular</b> <b>biology</b> to allow for inferences about when a crime took place and what took place. However, just as the introduction of DNA identity testing engendered many challenges, so the expansion of <b>molecular</b> <b>biology</b> into these domains will raise again the issues of scientific validity, interpretation, probative value, and infringement of personal liberties. This Commentary ponders some of these emerging issues, and presents some ideas on how they will affect the conduct of forensic <b>molecular</b> <b>biology</b> in the foreseeable future...|$|R
