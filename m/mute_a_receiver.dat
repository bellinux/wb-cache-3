40|$|Brass players use <b>a</b> {{variety of}} <b>mutes</b> {{to change the}} sound of their {{instrument}} for artistic expression. However, mutes can also modify the intonation and the playability of the muted instrument. An example is the use of <b>a</b> straight <b>mute</b> on <b>a</b> trombone, which makes it very difficult to play stable pedal notes. Previous studies have shown that using <b>a</b> straight <b>mute</b> establishes <b>a</b> parasitic acoustic resonance in the trombone. To cancel this modification, an active control device was developed and integrated into <b>a</b> <b>mute,</b> with satisfying experimental results [Meurisse et al., 2015]. With this device, the perturbed pedal notes can easily be played again. This paper investigates the ability of a physical model of brass instrument to reproduce the behaviour of the trombone pedal Bb without <b>mute,</b> or with <b>an</b> "active" or <b>a</b> "passive" straight <b>mute.</b> Linear stability analysis and time-domain simulations are used to analyse the behaviour of the model in the parameter range corresponding to the pedal note. Numerical results are compared for different models of instruments: a trombone, a trombone with <b>a</b> straight (passive) <b>mute,</b> <b>an</b> a trombone with <b>an</b> active <b>mute.</b> It is shown that the simple physical model considered behaves similarly to what is experienced with real instruments: the playing of the pedal note is perturbed with <b>a</b> passive <b>mute,</b> whereas the model of trombone with the experimental active mute gives results very similar to those obtained with an open trombone...|$|R
