For example, they can change their environment's albedo, increase runoff interception, stabilise <b>mineral</b> <b>soils</b> and develop their organic content, and affect local temperature. Plants compete with other organisms in their ecosystem for resources. They interact with their neighbours {{at a variety of}} spatial scales in groups, populations and communities that collectively constitute vegetation. Regions with characteristic vegetation types and dominant plants as well as similar abiotic and biotic factors, climate, and geography make up biomes like tundra or tropical rainforest.|$|E

40|$|Eucalyptus obliqua, {{the most}} {{widespread}} timber tree in Tasmania, is a pioneer after fire which can eliminate the organic layer of forest soil, exposing the underlying <b>mineral</b> <b>soil.</b> We compared seedling growth, mycorrhiza formation, and mineral nutrient limitation in organic layer versus <b>mineral</b> <b>soil.</b> We grew E. obliqua seedlings separately in pots of organic layer and <b>mineral</b> <b>soil</b> in a glasshouse. Additional treatments of organic soil only, involved fully crossed methyl-bromide fumigation and fertilization. Fertilization comprised chelated iron for 121 days after transplant (DAT) followed by soluble phosphorus. At 357 DAT, whole plant dry weight was three times greater in ambient organic than in <b>mineral</b> <b>soil.</b> In organic soil, fumigation halved ectomycorrhiza abundance and reduced seedling growth at 149 DAT, but by 357 DAT when negative effects of fumigation on seedling growth had disappeared, neither fumigation nor fertilization affected mycorrhiza abundance. Iron fertilization diminished seedling growth, but subsequent phosphorus fertilization improved it. E. obliqua seedlings grow much better in organic layer <b>soil</b> than in <b>mineral</b> <b>soil,</b> although phosphorus remains limiting.

40|$|Invasion {{of north}} {{temperate}} forest soils by exotic earthworms {{has the potential}} to alter microbial bio-mass and activity over large areas of North America. We measured the distribution and activity of micro-bial biomass in forest stands invaded by earthworms and in adjacent stands lacking earthworms in sugar maple-dominated forests in two locations in New York State, USA: one with a history of cultivation and thin organic surface soil horizons (forest floors) and the other with no history of cultivation and a thick (3 – 5 cm) forest floor. Earthworm invasion greatly reduced pools of microbial biomass in the forest floor and increased pools in the <b>mineral</b> <b>soil.</b> Enrichment of the <b>mineral</b> <b>soil</b> was much more marked at the site with thick forest floors. The increase in microbial biomass carbon (C) and nitro-gen (N) in the <b>mineral</b> <b>soil</b> at this site was larger than the decrease in the forest floor, resulting in a net increase in total soil profile microbial biomass in the invaded plots.

The thinned wildfire treatment produced less charcoal C than unthinned wildfire and thinned prescribed fire treatments. The charcoal formation rate was 1 to 8 % of woody fuels consumed, and this percentage was negatively related to woody fuels consumed, resulting in less charcoal formation with greater fire severity.

The research goal was to understand C storage in the forest floor and <b>mineral</b> <b>soil</b> and the major determinants. Relative to the northern forest (NF), the southern forest (SF) was found to produce higher amounts of litterfall (4. 3 vs. 2. 5 Mg·ha− 1) and to store less C in the forest floor (~ 8 vs. ~ 12 Mg·ha− 1) but more C in the <b>mineral</b> <b>soil</b> (~ 148 vs. ~ 72 Mg·ha− 1). Newly-shed litter of NF had lower P (0. 4 vs. 0. 6 mg·g− 1) but higher N concentration (13 vs. 10 mg·g− 1) than SF. Despite its lower Mn concentration (0. 06 vs. 0. 18 mg·g− 1), SF litter produces a Mn-richer humus (0. 32 vs. 0. 16 mg·g− 1) that is less stable. The data suggest that decomposition in the NF forest floor {{is limited by the}} shorter growing season (178 days vs. 238 days) and the higher N concentrations in newly shed litter and forest floor. Differences in C stock in the <b>mineral</b> <b>soil</b> reflect differences in ecosystem productivity and long-term organic-matter accumulation.

40|$|Subsurface flow within forest hillslopes is {{not well}} understood. A soil pit {{containing}} macropores was prepared and instrumented for subsurface flow measurements at the Hitachi Ohta Experimental Watershed. The subsurface flow from the soil profile was divided into five groups: the porous (including macropores) organic-rich soil layer; three macropore groups in the <b>mineral</b> <b>soil</b> layer; and the <b>mineral</b> <b>soil</b> matrix excluding visible macropores. The outflow from the organic-rich soil layer coincided with rainfall and depended strongly on rainfall intensity. Such a response {{is related to the}} location of the organic-rich layer in the uppermost portion of the soil profile. One macropore in the <b>mineral</b> <b>soil</b> was connected directly to a hydraulically active fracture in the bedrock. Therefore, the flow from this macropore group was high and delayed relative to rainfall even though the group is located in the upper left portion of the <b>mineral</b> <b>soil</b> layer. Most of the hillslope discharge occurred from the soil matrix excluding visible macropores. Preferential flow pathways in the <b>mineral</b> <b>soil,</b> as evidenced by staining tests, contributed to stormflow. The flow from two macropores just above bedrock was generally very low and responded gradually to rainfall inputs. This minor outflow was influenced by preferential flow above bedrock. Four macropores in the upper right portion of the <b>mineral</b> <b>soil</b> layer did not connect to preferential flow pathways. Therefore, outflow from this group was measured only when large rain events occurred. Soil moisture, amounts and intensities of rainfall, and bedrock topography affected heterogeneous outflow from the soil profile. The expansion and extension of macropore networks might contribute to stormflow. Results indicate that hydrometric measurements are needed to support inferences derived from end member mixing analysis and topographic-based hydrologic models related to complex preferential flow pathways in forest catchments.
