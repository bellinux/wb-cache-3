5|$|As I {{look back}} on it today, I see the whole picture very differently. It's true that I hated missing out on Sexton. And the first few months, I was miserable at Everett.

It got me out of my own little world and taught <b>me</b> <b>how</b> to understand white people, how to communicate and deal with them.|$|E

Let me tell you that no one has ever made a film with too much passion and violence.” So I pressed on. Everyone was dying. At {{the end of the film}} half of the city was dead.|$|E

What is needed from my openers, and is most important, is {{patience}} and plenty of it.' I was completely willing to be guided by anything that Bradman wanted me to do.|$|E

25|$|Would you ask <b>me</b> <b>how</b> I dare {{to compare}} the civil rights {{struggle}} with the struggle for lesbian and gay rights?

And I can sum up that difference in one word: none.|$|E

Any successful program functions as an integrated whole of many factors. Trying to select one aspect as the key one will not work. Each element depends on all the others.|$|E

25|$|The Test to Measure Upper Limb Apraxia (TULIA) is {{one method}} of {{determining}} upper limb apraxia through the {{qualitative and quantitative}} assessment of gesture production. In contrast to previous publications on apraxic assessment, {{the reliability and validity}} of TULIA was thoroughly investigated. The TULIA consists of subtests for the imitation and pantomime of non-symbolic (“put your index finger on top of your nose”), intransitive (“wave goodbye”) and transitive (“show <b>me</b> <b>how</b> to use a hammer”) gestures. Discrimination (differentiating between well- and poorly performed tasks) and recognition (indicating which object corresponds to a pantomimed gesture) tasks are also often tested for a full apraxia evaluation.|$|E
