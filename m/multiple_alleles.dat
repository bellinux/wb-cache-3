25|$|All {{the common}} blood types, {{such as the}} ABO blood group system, are genetic polymorphisms. Here we see a system where {{there are more than}} two morphs: the phenotypes A, B, AB and O are present in all human populations, but vary in {{proportion}} {{in different parts of the}} world. The phenotypes are controlled by <b>multiple</b> <b>alleles</b> at one locus. These polymorphisms are seemingly never eliminated by natural selection; the reason came from a study of disease statistics.|$|E
25|$|The grove snail, Cepaea nemoralis, {{is famous}} for the rich {{polymorphism}} of its shell. The system is controlled {{by a series of}} <b>multiple</b> <b>alleles.</b> The shell colour series is brown (genetically the top dominant trait), dark pink, light pink, very pale pink, dark yellow and light yellow (the bottom or universal recessive trait). Bands may be present or absent; and if present from one to five in number. Unbanded is the top dominant trait, and the forms of banding are controlled by modifier genes (see epistasis).|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although many low-penetrant genetic {{risk factors}} for breast cancer have been discovered, {{knowledge}} {{about the effect of}} <b>multiple</b> risk <b>alleles</b> is limited, especially in women o 50 years. We therefore investigated the association between <b>multiple</b> risk <b>alleles</b> and breast cancer risk as well as individual effects according to age-approximated pre- and post-menopausal status. METHODS: Ten previously described breast cancer-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analysed in a joint European biobank-based study comprising 3584 breast cancer cases and 5063 cancer-free controls. Genotyping was performed using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and odds ratios were estimated using logistic regression. RESULTS: Significant associations with breast cancer were confirmed for 7 of the 10 SNPs. Analysis of the joint effect of the original 10 as well as the statistically significant 7 SNPs (rs 2981582, rs 3803662, rs 889312, rs 13387042, rs 13281615, rs 3817198 an...|$|R
30|$|Another key {{finding in}} this study is that <b>multiple</b> Pokkali <b>alleles</b> were found at the Saltol locus between {{different}} RILs in the original mapping population. Subsequently, backcross lines with <b>multiple</b> Pokkali <b>alleles</b> were developed to further investigate the allelic variation at Saltol. In addition to the two major alleles found in the RIL population, as seen in FL 540 and FL 378 versus the distinct allele in FL 478, two additional alleles were seen in the backcross lines developed from the families NIL- 17 and NIL- 30 (Fig.  3). Although the marker patterns differed across the Saltol region, a gene-based marker at SKC 1 revealed that the NIL- 17 line was similar to the common Pokkali allele, while the NIL- 30 line shared an allele with IR 29 at that marker locus, i.e. {{they do not have the}} Saltol locus. Progeny from these two families were further characterized for expression of candidate genes underlying Saltol, revealing that the SKC 1 gene transcripts increased in Pokkali and NIL- 17 at 7 and 14  days after salinization, but not in NIL- 30, FL 478, or IR 29 (Tumimbang-Raiz and Blumwald, unpublished data). Sequencing of the SKC 1 alleles across the different NILs may help identity the origin of the different Pokkali alleles and would allow for characterization of any functional polymorphisms that may contribute to the Saltol phenotype. Although the presence of <b>multiple</b> Pokkali <b>alleles</b> has complicated the validation and application of the Saltol locus, it also presents an opportunity to further investigate the effect of allelic variation from different Pokkali alleles on the underlying tolerance mechanisms.|$|R
25|$|Thomas Hunt Morgan {{began using}} fruit flies in {{experimental}} studies of heredity at Columbia University in 1910 in a laboratory known as the Fly Room. The Fly Room was cramped with eight desks, each occupied by students and their experiments. They started off experiments using milk bottles to rear the fruit flies and handheld lenses for observing their traits. The lenses were later replaced by microscopes, which enhanced their observations. Morgan and his students eventually elucidated many basic principles of heredity, including sex-linked inheritance, epistasis, <b>multiple</b> <b>alleles,</b> and gene mapping.|$|E
25|$|Regardless {{of their}} {{ambiguous}} evolutionary history, platypuses have been empirically determined to follow an XY sex-determination system, with females possessing five pairs of X chromosomes as the homogametic sex, and males possessing five X and five Y chromosomes as the heterogametic sex. Because the entire genome of the platypus {{has yet to}} be completely sequenced (including one of the X chromosomes), there is still continued investigation as to the definitive mechanism of dosage compensation that Platypuses follow. Research from the laboratory of Jennifer Graves used qPCR and SNP analysis of BACs containing various genes from X chromosomes in order to find whether <b>multiple</b> <b>alleles</b> for particular X-linked genes were being expressed at once, or were otherwise being dosage compensated. Her group found that in female platypuses, some X-linked genes only expressed an allele from one X chromosomes, while other genes expressed <b>multiple</b> <b>alleles.</b> This appears to be a system similar to the selective silencing method of dosage compensation observed in birds. However, about half of all X-linked genes also seemed to stochastically express only one active copy of said gene, alluding to the system of random X-inactivation observed in humans. These findings suggest that platypuses may employ a hybrid form of dosage compensation that combines feature from mammals as well as birds. Understanding the evolution of such a system may have implications for solidifying the true ancestral lineage of monotremes.|$|E
25|$|By 1990, {{the full}} {{complexity}} of the HLA class I antigens was beginning to be understood. At the time new serotypes were being determined, the problem with <b>multiple</b> <b>alleles</b> for each serotype was becoming apparent by nucleotide sequencing. RFLP analysis helped determine new alleles, but sequencing was more thorough. Throughout the 1990s, PCR kits, called SSP-PCR kits were developed that allowed, at least under optimal conditions, the purification of DNA, PCR and Agarose Gel identification of alleles within an 8-hour day. Alleles {{that could not be}} clearly identified by serotype and PCR could be sequenced, allowing for the refinement of new PCR kits.|$|E
40|$|Sugarcane cultivars are polyploid, aneuploid, {{interspecific}} hybrids {{between the}} domesticated species S. officinarum, and a wild relative S. spontaneum. Their chromosome number ranges from 100 - 130 with approximately 10 % contributed by S. spontaneum and ploidy number ranging between 8 and 10. This chromosomal allele complexity limits mapping to dominant single dose DNA markers with <b>multiple</b> dose <b>alleles</b> offering a greater challenge. Verifying haplotypes by SNP marker patterns may offer {{a solution for}} this challenge. EST alignments are a rich source for mining SNPs, {{and the use of}} pyrosequencing {{has proved to be a}} reliable method for measuring the SNP base ratios allowing quantitative SNP allelotyping in sugarcane. Measuring the base ratios at the SNP loci would discriminate single from <b>multiple</b> dose <b>alleles.</b> Verifying the haplotype compositions will genotype the alleles which may provide some information on the phenotypic, genotypic relationship in sugarcane. We have identified SNP haplotypes in isogenes of sucrose phosphate synthase, the sucrose biosynthetic enzyme of sugarcane and are examining these in segregating progeny displaying variation in sucrose accumulation...|$|R
30|$|While MAGIC populations offer {{a number}} of {{advantages}} for the extraction of new alleles, additional breeding approaches should be considered depending on breeding objectives. For introducing simple traits, marker assisted backcrossing (MABC) has been widely used to improve a single genotype by adding a favourable donor allele. In the case of complex traits, however, MABC becomes complicated as <b>multiple</b> donor <b>alleles</b> have to be introgressed to obtain the desired phenotype. Marker-assisted recurrent selection (MARS) is an improvement over MABC. Essentially, MARS involves marker-aided selection (MAS) of lines followed by inter-mating to derive recombined lines carrying <b>multiple</b> donor <b>alleles</b> of interest. Phenotypic recurrent selection with no MAS {{has been used as}} an alternate approach, although this could be a time-consuming process. For both MAGIC and MARS, careful selection of parental lines is important to capture multiple favourable traits. Unlike multi-allelic MARS, the selection of MAGIC parents is not guided by known QTLs but by their phenotypes. This increases the potential of capturing novel QTLs with small phenotypic variance and QTL combinations to enhance the improvement of complex traits. An insightful review of different backcrossing and breeding approaches is provided by Ribaut and Ragot (2007).|$|R
5|$|When <b>multiple</b> {{different}} <b>alleles</b> for a gene {{are present}} in a species's population it is called polymorphic. Most different alleles are functionally equivalent, however some alleles can give rise to different phenotypic traits. A gene's most common allele is called the wild type, and rare alleles are called mutants. The genetic variation in relative frequencies of different alleles in a population is due to both natural selection and genetic drift. The wild-type allele {{is not necessarily the}} ancestor of less common alleles, nor is it necessarily fitter.|$|R
25|$|Ludwik Hirszfeld and E. von Dungern {{discovered}} the heritability of ABO blood groups in 1910–11. Felix Bernstein demonstrated the correct blood group inheritance pattern of <b>multiple</b> <b>alleles</b> at one locus in 1924. Watkins and Morgan, in England, {{discovered that the}} ABO epitopes were conferred by sugars, to be specific, N-acetylgalactosamine for the A-type and galactose for the B-type. After much published literature claiming that the ABH substances were all attached to glycosphingolipids, Finne et al. (1978) found that the human erythrocyte glycoproteins contain polylactosamine chains that contains ABH substances attached and represent {{the majority of the}} antigens. The main glycoproteins carrying the ABH antigens were identified to be the Band 3 and Band 4.5 proteins and glycophorin. Later, Yamamoto's group showed the precise glycosyl transferase set that confers the A, B and O epitopes.|$|E
25|$|Platypuses are a monotreme species whose {{mechanism}} of sex determination {{has been extensively}} studied. There is some contention in academia about the evolutionary origin and the proper taxonomy of platypuses. A recent study revealed that four platypus X chromosomes, {{as well as a}} Y chromosome, are homologous to some regions on the avian Z chromosome. Specifically, platypus X1 shares homology with the chicken Z chromosome, and both share homology with the human chromosome 9. This homology is important when considering the {{mechanism of}} dosage compensation in monotremes. In 50% of female platypus cells, only one of the alleles on these X chromosomes is expressed while in the remaining 50% <b>multiple</b> <b>alleles</b> are expressed. This, combined with the portions that are homologous to chicken Z and human 9 chromosomes imply that this level of incomplete silencing may be the ancestral form of dosage compensation.|$|E
25|$|Genome-wide {{association}} studies (GWAS) revealed {{regions of}} linkage {{that were found}} on most chromosomes. These studies are useful in identifying the genes that {{may be responsible for}} complex diseases such as SLE. Candidate gene loci implicated with SLE include <b>multiple</b> <b>alleles</b> from the HLA region, Fc-gamma receptor, and complement component system. However, association does not prove that a specific form of a gene is responsible for the disease, as there may be other polymorphisms in the region that have a greater association effect. However, because the biological role of most genes are not completely understood, {{it can be difficult to}} attribute phenotypic traits to certain genetic polymorphisms. Since SLE is associated with so many genetic regions, it is likely an oligogenic trait, meaning that there are several genes that control susceptibility to the disease. Further complicating our understanding is the association of certain linkages with various ethnic groups.|$|E
40|$|<b>Multiple</b> loss-of-function (LOF) <b>alleles</b> at {{the same}} gene may {{influence}} a phenotype {{not only in the}} homozygote state when alleles are considered individually, but also in the compound heterozygote (CH) state. Such LOF alleles typically have low frequencies and moderate to large effects. Detecting such variants is of interest to the genetics community, and relevant statistical methods for detecting and quantifying their effects are sorely needed. We present a collapsed double heterozygosity (CDH) test to detect the presence of <b>multiple</b> LOF <b>alleles</b> at a gene. When causal SNPs are available, which may be the case in next generation genome sequencing studies, this CDH test has overwhelmingly higher power than single SNP analysis. When causal SNPs are not directly available such as in current GWA settings, we show the CDH test has higher power than standard single SNP analysis if tagging SNPs are in linkage disequilibrium with the underlying causal SNPs to at least a moderate degree (r 2 > 0. 1). The test is implemented for genome-wide analysis in the publically available software package GenABEL which is based on a sliding window approach. We provide the proof of principle by conducting a genome-wide CDH analysis of red hair color, a trait known to be influenced by <b>multiple</b> loss-of-function <b>alleles,</b> in a total of 7, 732 Dutch individuals with hair color ascertained. The association signals at the MC 1 R gene locus from CDH were uniformly more significant than traditional GWA analyses (the most significant P for CDH = 3. 11 × 10 - 142 vs. P for rs 258322 = 1. 33 × 10 - 66). The CDH test will contribute towards finding rare LOF variants in GWAS and sequencing studies...|$|R

40|$|Polycomb group (PcG) genes encode {{evolutionarily}} conserved transcriptional repressors {{that are}} required for the long-term silencing of particular developmental control genes in animals and plants. PcG genes were first identified in Drosophila as regulators that keep HOX genes inactive in cells where these genes must remain silent during development. Here, we report {{the results of a}} genetic screen aimed at isolating novel PcG mutants in Drosophila. In an EMS mutagenesis, we isolated 82 mutants that show Polycomb-like phenotypes in clones in the adult epidermis and misexpression of the HOX gene Ubx in clones in the imaginal wing disc. Analysis of these mutants revealed that we isolated <b>multiple</b> new <b>alleles</b> in most of the already- known PcG genes. In addition, we isolated <b>multiple</b> mutant <b>alleles</b> in each of ten different genes that previously had not been known to function in PcG repression. We show that the newly identified PcG gene calypso is required for the long-term repression of multiple HOX genes in embryos and larvae. In addition, our studies reveal that the Kto/Med 12 and Skd/Med 13 subunits of the Med 12 ·Med 13 ·Cdk 8 ·CycC repressor subcomplex of Mediator are needed for repression of the HOX gene Ubx. The results of the mutant screen reported here suggest that the majority of nonredundant Drosophila genes with strong classic PcG phenotypes have been identified...|$|R

50|$|In Mendelian inheritance, genes {{have only}} two alleles, such as a and A.

One of the best-known examples is coat color in rabbits. A rabbit's coat color is determined by a single gene that has at least four different alleles. The four known alleles display a pattern of simple dominance that can produce four coat colors. Many other genes have <b>multiple</b> <b>alleles,</b> including the human genes for ABO blood type.|$|E
40|$|Single {{nucleotide}} polymorphisms (SNPs) {{within a}} gene region {{have often been}} studied to determine their effect on phenotype. Although a single base pair change can produce a phenotypic change, phenotype is often influenced {{by the presence of}} multiple polymorphisms and their relative positions within a given region. For example, if multiple changes occur in a promoter region, how they influence gene expression will depend on their cis/trans configuration. As such, it is essential to consider the haplotype, or the alignment of <b>multiple</b> SNP <b>alleles</b> on each chromosome when attempting to associate genomic changes with phenotype. Unfortunately, no method of high-throughput molecular haplotyping of multiple SNPs currently exists. In response to this unmet need, we have developed an inexpensive, reliable bead-based capture-based haplotyping (CBH) assay to determine the phase, or haplotype, of <b>multiple</b> SNP <b>alleles</b> in a high-throughput manner. The CBH assay requires minimal setup and handling, requires no centrifugation steps and can be performed in < 1 h. Data collection is performed via flow cytometry and the assay yields plus/minus results allowing for automated calling by a simple computer application. We will present data demonstrating the molecular haplotyping of 11 SNPs within exon 2 of the N-acetyltransferase- 2 (NAT 2) gene, which expresses an important drug-metabolizing enzyme.

30|$|During {{the initial}} SSR {{genotyping}} of the IR 29 /Pokkali QTL population, <b>multiple</b> Pokkali <b>alleles</b> were observed between RILs at certain loci. For example, at the marker RM 8094 on chromosome 1, {{four of the}} RILs had a different Pokkali allele {{than the rest of}} the population: FL 334, FL 478, FL 479, and FL 481 (data not shown). Likewise, during the process of developing NILs for the Saltol locus, <b>multiple</b> Pokkali <b>alleles</b> were observed between different sets of backcross lines. This complicated the analysis of the Saltol locus and the subsequent development of markers for MABC; hence the following analysis was undertaken to resolve these problems. The majority of the IR 29 /Pokkali backcross lines and the RIL population shared a common Pokkali allele; however, the lines derived from FL 478 had a distinct allele at Saltol. Furthermore, two slightly different alleles were also detected in the IR 29 /Pokkali backcross population: one represented by line J 21 (derived from the NIL- 17 family) and the other found in J 38 (derived from the NIL- 30 family) that did not seem to match the other IR 29 /Pokkali or FL 478 backcross lines (Fig.  3). Although the marker haplotypes across the Saltol region for these two lines are different, line J 21 shares the same allele at the gene-based marker SKC 1 b as the more common Pokkali allele, while the SKC 1 b allele at line J 38 was the same as IR 29 (Supplementary Table  3).|$|R

40|$|A {{technique}} is described that greatly increases {{the efficiency of}} recovering specific locus point mutations in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Founder individuals that were mosaic for point mutations were produced by mutagenizing postmeiotic gametes with the alkylating agent N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea. Under optimal conditions, each founder carried an average of 10 mutations affecting genes required for embryogenesis. Moreover, approximately 2 % of these founders transmitted new mutations at any prespecified pigmentation locus. Analyses of new pigmentation mutations confirmed that most {{were likely to be}} point mutations. Thus, mutagenesis of postmeiotic gametes with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea yielded frequencies of point mutations at specific loci that were 10 - to 15 -fold higher than previously achieved in zebrafish.
