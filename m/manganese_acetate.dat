5000|$|The {{mechanism}} of manganese(III)-mediated radical reactions {{begins with the}} single-electron oxidation of a carbonyl compound to an α-oxoalkyl radical. Addition to an olefin then occurs, generating adduct radical 2. The fate of 2 is primarily determined by reaction conditions—in the presence of copper(II) acetate, this intermediate undergoes further oxidation to a carbocation and may eliminate to form β,γ-unsaturated ketone 4. <b>Manganese</b> <b>acetate</b> itself can effect the second oxidation of resonance-stabilized adduct radicals to carbocations 5; unstabilized radicals undergo further transformations before reacting with Mn(OAc)3. Atom transfer from another molecule of substrate may generate saturated compound 3. Adduct radicals or carbocations may undergo ligand-transfer reactions, yielding γ-functionalized carbonyl compounds. When lithium chloride is used as an additive, chlorination takes place. Alternatively, carbocations may be trapped intramolecularly by the carbonyl oxygen to form dihydrofurans after β-elimination.(2) ...|$|E

40|$|Bacterial {{distributions}} {{were determined}} at Site 1149 in the Izu-Bonin Trench, {{which is a}} deepwater (5818 m) low-sedimentation-rate area. This was the first Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) leg where contamination checks were conducted for microbiology. These demonstrated that the inner portion of cores, where the microbiological samples were taken, were free from any potential sampling contamination. Bacterial populations were present in all samples (deepest at 171. 2 meters below seafloor [mbsf]). The highest numbers were near the surface (1. 4 mbsf; 7. 2 °— 106 cells/cm 3), but these declined rapidly within the upper 10 mbsf. Below this, numbers decreased at a more gradual rate to 7. 2 °— 105 cells/cm 3 at 172 mbsf, a 10 -fold reduction. This two-stage bacterial depth distribution has been observed at several other ODP sites (e. g., Amazon Fan and Santa Barbara Basin). Bacterial depth distributions at this site were well below those predicted by the general equation for global deep-sediment bacteria and predominantly below the lower 95 % prediction limits. These low bacterial populations were thought to reflect the low sedimentation rates and low input of bioavailable organic matter that is characteristic for deepwater sites. Consistent with this trend {{is that there was}} only limited removal of pore water sulfate and, thus, bacterial sulfate reduction. Most of this removal was in the top ~ 5 mbsf, coinciding with the highest bacterial populations, the presence of small amounts of methane, and an increase in pore water manganese and ammonia. In the deeper sediments, however, there was still indirect evidence of continuing low bacterial activity, with increases in pore water ammonia, soluble <b>manganese,</b> bioavailable <b>acetate,</b> and decreasing sulfate. Interestingly, manganese reduction, sulfate reduction, and a limited amount of methanogenesis seemed to be occurring simultaneously at depth in this low–organic matter site, and the coincident detection of bacterial populations provides further support for the universal presence of a deep biosphere in marine sediments...|$|R
40|$|The work in thesis {{aims for}} {{artificial}} photosyntesis, which could and will mimic natural photosynthesis, {{the process that}} uses light to create energy rich compounds from H 2 O and CO 2. Water is oxidized in Photosystem II (PSII) by the Water Oxidizing Complex (WOC), which is a catalytic site on the lumenal side of the thylakoid membrane. The chlorophyll complex P 680 absorbs light and electrons are transferred to the acceptor side of PSII. The electron-hole on P 680 is filled by electrons from the Mn-cluster, which in turn oxidizes water. This {{can be viewed as}} a D (donor) -PS (photosensitizer) -A (acceptor) system. Artificial photosynthesis builds on the same principles, and in this work we have been focusing on redox reactions in dinuclear manganese complexes, using RuII(bpy) 3 as photosensitizer. WOC in PSII is built up by four manganeses in a cluster, with ?-oxo bridges between the manganeses. On at least one of the manganeses, there is an open site for water binding. In this thesis I have investigated oxidation reactions of three different dinuclear manganese complexes, denoted complex 1, 2, and 3. 1 is a complex with N 3 O 3 ligands coordination to each manganese, and is synthesised in Mn 2 II/II valance state. We have showed that it is possible to oxidize this complex three times to Mn 2 III/IV, which means that it forms four stable oxidation states. 2 has a N 2 O 4 ligands coordinating each manganese, and is synthesised in the Mn 2 III/III valence state. This complex can be oxidized to what we think is Mn 2 IV/IV and Mn 2 IV/IVL?. 2 has five stable oxidation states. From electro chemistry we know that 2 is stable in Mn 2 II/II and Mn 2 II/III, and this means that 2 can be oxidized by photosensitizer three steps. 3 is an unymmetric manganese complex, with a mixture of the ligands in 1 and 2. On one side the manganese is coordinated to N 3 O 3 ligands, and the other manganese is coordinated to N 2 O 4 ligands. 3 is synthesised in the Mn 2 II/III valence state, and it is possible to oxidize this complex to, what we think is a Mn 2 IV/IV and a Mn 2 IV/IVL? oxidation state. By electro chemistry we can reduce 3 to Mn 2 II/II. This means that 3 can be oxidized four times with the photosensitizer and have five stable oxidation states. All three <b>manganese</b> complexes have <b>acetate</b> groups as bridging ligands to the manganeses. EXAFS measurements and from electro chemistry, indicate that the acetate groups can detach from the manganese, so that water can access the site and be converted into ligands to the manganese. From the X-ray absorption spectroscopy (EXAFS and K-edge), we could se that there was a shortening in the Mn-Mn distance of 0. 5 Å for 1 in the Mn 2 III/III and at Mn 2 III/III for 2, which is an indication that a ?-oxo or a ?-hydroxo bond is formed. This means that the manganese cluster changes its conformation during oxidation. To oxidize our model complexes beyond Mn 2 III/III, we use CoIII(NH 3) 5 Cl as sacrificial electron acceptor. When CoIII is reduced by Ru*(bpy) 3 to CoII, an EPR signal appears in the g= 5 region which belongs to CoII(H 2 O) 6. After some time of illumination a new EPR signal appears in the same region, which is narrower and more symmetric in its shape, resulting from a photoreduction process in CoIII(NH 3) 5 Cl. It is known that UV light can photoreduce CoIII(NH 3) 5 Cl to CoII(NH 3) 4 and Cl?, but we have found that the same reaction occurs at 532 nm. We have interpreted this signal as an intermediate, when cobalt changes the ligands from NH 3 and Cl- to H 2 O...|$|R

Research results contributed to the elaboration of technological flow for obtaining of high yield of ergosterol from yeasts. The significant increasing of ergosterol content is possible due to the utililization of optimized nutritive medium with <b>manganese</b> <b>acetate</b> (0. 012 gL- 1) and glucose (40 gL- 1); the treatment of inoculum with lowintensity millimeter waves for 20 - 30 minutes. </p...|$|E
30|$|The H 2 -TPR {{profile for}} the {{material}} prepared using <b>manganese</b> <b>acetate</b> as precursor (Fig.  5 c) detected two reduction peaks at 349 and at 373  °C. The profile {{is similar to}} that using manganese sulphate and chloride, but the reduction peak (high temperature one) shifted to lower temperature from 450 to 375  °C compared with the two other precursors. This implies that the reduction of cryptomelane seems to be easier, i.e. the reducibility and reactivity of manganese are higher. In other words, the Mn–O bonds of OMS- 2 on using manganese sulphate and manganese chloride precursors are stronger and reduced more difficultly than that for acetate.|$|E
