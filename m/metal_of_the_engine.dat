50|$|<b>The</b> {{development}} <b>of</b> machine tools, {{such as the}} lathe, planing {{and shaping}} machines powered by these <b>engines,</b> enabled all <b>the</b> <b>metal</b> parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> to be easily and accurately cut and in turn {{made it possible to}} build larger and more powerful engines.|$|R
50|$|Hot {{corrosion}} {{can affect}} gas turbines operating in high salt environments (e.g., near the ocean). Salts, including chlorides and sulfates, are ingested by the turbines and deposited in <b>the</b> hot sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engine; other elements present in fuels also form salts, e.g. vanadates. The heat from <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> melts these salts which then can flux the passivating oxide layers on <b>the</b> <b>metal</b> components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> allowing corrosion to occur at an accelerated rate.|$|R
50|$|Monturiol envisaged a new vessel, {{custom built}} to house his new engine, {{which would be}} entirely built <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> with <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> housed in its own {{separate}} compartment. However, due to <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> his finances, {{construction of a new}} vessel was out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> question, and instead he managed to assemble enough funds to fit <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> into <b>the</b> Ictineo II.|$|R
50|$|Oil leaks in an {{air cooled}} system were fire hazards, as well as health safety hazards because when oil leaks onto <b>the</b> hot <b>metal</b> {{surfaces}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> it creates smoke and could ignite causing severe damage to the automobile, and its occupants. Also, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> burnt layer <b>of</b> oil, cooling would be drastically decreased. Kettering understood these concerns and continued to work on ways that would minimize <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> an oil leak on the hot cylinders. He found that the best solution was to have only one possible leak site above the cylinder heads. That is the joint between the crankcase and the cylinder. This left almost no oil above the cylinders, and only one possible place for a leak to spring. This significantly reduced <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> an oil leak, as well as allowing automobile technicians to locate the possible oil leak much more efficiently.|$|R
50|$|On May 26, 1886, the Grand Central hoist and {{pumping plant}} burned. The fire {{was so intense}} that <b>the</b> <b>metal</b> {{components}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cornish <b>engine</b> melted and warped. <b>The</b> headworks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main mine shaft were also destroyed. Shortly afterward, <b>the</b> price <b>of</b> silver slid to 90 cents an ounce. The mines that remained operational laid off workers. Individuals who had thought about leaving Tombstone when the mine flooding started now took action. <b>The</b> price <b>of</b> silver briefly recovered {{for a while and}} a few mines began producing again, but never at the level reached in the early 1880s.|$|R
50|$|The chassis was {{suspended}} from the front axle at just one point by a pivoted transverse leaf spring which made no contribution to transverse stability and the whole car rested on just three points. Radius rods from the gearbox take up braking strains and act as distance stays for the back axle. <b>The</b> front end <b>of</b> these stays have buffer springs The foot brake is the contracting band type, the hand brake is <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pull-on internal expanding type. Both sets <b>of</b> brake are <b>metal</b> to <b>metal.</b> <b>The</b> action <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> brake avoids much use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conventional braking system. The rear springs attach {{by means of a}} spherical case clipping over a spherical turned part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> axle casing thus allowing a little motion due to bumps.|$|R
30|$|Lubricating oils {{play a very}} {{important}} role in automobile industry. It keeps the moving parts lubricated and protects them against rust and corrosion. Lubricating oils alone cannot satisfy all <b>the</b> requirements <b>of</b> modern <b>engines.</b> Some additives are to be blended with lube oil to improve <b>the</b> overall performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lubricant [1]. <b>The</b> role <b>of</b> additives in lubricant is very significant. They optimize <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> lubricant and generally fall into two major categories viz. surface active additive and performance enhancing additive [2]. The first one protects <b>the</b> <b>metal</b> surfaces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> from corrosion, such as antiwear, anti-rust and extreme pressure additives [3]. The second type reinforces the base stock performance, such as viscosity index improver (VII) [4, 5], pour point depressant (PPD) [6, 7], antioxidant [8], and detergent–dispersant [9]. Generally, in <b>the</b> formulation <b>of</b> a high performance lubricant, different types of additives at different percentages are blended with the base stocks. This increases <b>the</b> overall cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> furnished lubricant. <b>The</b> addition <b>of</b> additives having multifunctional character to the base fluid may lead to formulate a cost effective as well as better performing lubricant. Therefore, research in this area has attracted much attention. In this work we have synthesized multifunctional additives which showed excellent VII and PPD performances. Lot of works in this direction has carried out so far. Kamal and his group [10] in their work have shown <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> copolymers of vinyl acetate (VA) and esters of acrylic acid as viscosity index improver for lubricating oil. They also studied <b>the</b> rheological properties <b>of</b> lube oil with and without polymeric additives. Al-Sabagh and his group [11] have mentioned <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> copolymers of VA with n-alkyl itaconate as pour point depressants in lubricating oil. The rheological properties were also studied by the same research team. Abdel-Azim et al. [12] has synthesized <b>the</b> copolymers <b>of</b> dialkyl fumarate with vinyl acetate and recognized that <b>the</b> copolymer <b>of</b> didodecyl fumarate with VA is the most effective as PPD for lubricating oil. In 2008, Nassar [13] had prepared six polymers at different molar ratios of 2 -ethylhexyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate and studied <b>the</b> VI property <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lubricants. He reported that most efficient VI property is obtained when <b>the</b> ratio <b>of</b> acrylate and vinyl acetate is 1 : 0.2. <b>The</b> potential application <b>of</b> copolymer of vinyl acetate (VA) as pour point depressant for crude oil is also well documented. VA—α olefin copolymers [14] and VA—methacrylate copolymers [15] were used as pour point depressant for crude oil. <b>The</b> copolymers <b>of</b> vinyl acetate, styrene and n-butyl acrylate having different monomer ratios were used to study <b>the</b> rheological behaviours <b>of</b> Mexican crude oil [16]. Borthakur and his group [17] have shown <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> alkyl fumarate and vinyl acetate copolymer in combination with alkyl acrylate as a flow improver for high waxy Borholla crude oil. Machado et al. [18] studied <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers on viscosity and pour point of a Brazilian crude oil. Al-Shafy and Ismail prepared an ester of polyethylene acrylic acid with 1 -docosanol and finally it was grafted with vinyl acetate to produce graft ester. The grafted product was used as flow improver for Egyptian waxy crude oils [19].|$|R
