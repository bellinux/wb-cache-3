50|$|Most players {{made after}} the mid-1980s {{are capable of}} also playing Compact Discs. These players include a 4.7 in {{indentation}} in the loading tray, where the CD is placed for playback. At least two Pioneer models (the CLD-M301 and the CLD-M90) also operate as a CD changer, with several 4.7 in indentations around the circumference of the <b>main</b> <b>tray.</b>|$|E

50|$|An {{impression}} tray is a container which holds the impression material as it sets and supports the set impression. There are 2 <b>main</b> types of <b>trays.</b> Stock trays are manufactured en masse {{in a range}} of sizes and shapes, from which the closest size and shape tray is selected that matches the dimensions of the dental arches of the person who is to receive the impression. Special trays (or custom trays) are made to fit a specific individual's mouth by a denturist (dental technician). Special trays are constructed on a cast from a preliminary impression which utilizes stock trays.|$|R
40|$|Non {{uniformity}} of {{final moisture content}} of the product being dried is the <b>main</b> drawback of <b>tray</b> dryers. The difficulty in maintaining the uniform air velocity throughout the drying chamber had been identified as {{the main reason for}} this non uniform drying. A CFD model was developed to analyses the velocity and temperature profiles of a cinnamon chips dryer by using STAR CD. The modeled data for air velocities had been experimentally verified for velocity distribution within the drying chamber. The CFD analysis revealed the presence of non uniform air re-circulating zones at the inlet air duct and drying chamber, which results in non {{uniformity of}} air velocities. Previously reported variations of moisture level in dried cinnamon chips at different tray locations were compared with modeled velocity distributions of the present study. The results indicated that the variations in the moisture level of dried cinnamon chips were directly attributed to the non uniform air distributions at different tray location...|$|R
40|$|Statement of Problem: Various {{impression}} {{techniques have}} different {{effects on the}} accuracy of final cast dimensions. Meanwhile; there are some controversies about the best technique. Purpose: This study was performed to compare two kinds of implant impression methods (open tray and closed tray) on 15 degree angled implants. Materials and Method: In this experimental study, a steel model with 8 cm in diameter and 3 cm in height were produced with 3 holes devised inside to stabilize 3 implants. The central implant was straight {{and the other two}} implants were 15 ° angled. The two angled implants had 5 cm distance from each other and 3. 5 cm from the central implant. Dental stone, high strength (type IV) was used for the <b>main</b> casts. Impression <b>trays</b> were filled with poly ether, and then the two impression techniques (open tray and closed tray) were compared. To evaluate positions of the implants, each cast was analyzed by CMM device in 3 dimensions (x,y,z). Differences in the measurements obtained from final casts and laboratory model were analyzed using t-Test. Results: The obtained results indicated that closed tray impression technique was significantly different in dimensional accuracy when compared with open tray method. Dimensional changes were 129 ± 37 μ and 143. 5 ± 43. 67 μ in closed tray and open tray, while coefficient of variation in closed- tray and open tray were reported to be 27. 2 % and 30. 4 %, respectively. Conclusion: Closed impression technique had less dimensional changes in comparison with open tray method, so this study suggests that closed tray impression technique is more accurate...|$|R
