Here, we analyze the analytical predictions <b>of</b> a general <b>model</b> suitable for describing the spatial biodiversity similarity in river ecosystems, and benchmark them against the empirical occurrence data of freshwater fish species collected in the Mississippi-Missouri river system. Encapsulating immigration, emigration, and stochastic noise, and without resorting to species abundance data, the model is able to reproduce the observed probability distribution of the Jaccard similarity index at any given distance. In addition to providing an excellent agreement with the empirical data, this approach accounts for heterogeneities of different subbasins, suggesting a strong dependence of biodiversity similarity on their respective climates. Strikingly, the model can also predict the actual probability distribution of the Jaccard similarity index for any distance when considering just a relatively small sample.

Pulsations are shown to be excluded for young Am stars but occur naturally when these stars evolve off the ZAMS.

M. octodecemspinosus dominated the area's fish fauna during the summer months. Although M. scorpius was a year round inhabitant of the area, its population was greatly decreased in the winter. Analyses of distribution patterns for these two species indicated that M. octodecemspinosus ranged through the depth gradient of the gulch and occupied various types of open bottom terrain. M. scorpius was {{more common in the}} lower reaches of the gulch and was associated with cover throughout the summer months.

Accounting for shifts in biocrust composition is important for quantifying integrity of arid and semi-arid ecosystems, but the best methods for assessing biocrusts are uncertain. We investigate the utility of surveying biocrust morphogroups, a reduced set of biotic classes, compared to species data, for detecting shifts in biocrust composition and making inference about dryland degradation. We used multivariate regression tree (MRT) analyses to model morphogroup abundance, species abundance and species occurrence data from two independent studies in semi-arid open woodlands of south-eastern Australia. We advanced the MRT method with a 'best subsets' model selection procedure, which improved model stability and prediction. Biocrust morphogroup composition responded strongly to surrogate variables of ecological degradation. Further, MRT <b>models</b> <b>of</b> morphogroup data had stronger explanatory power and predictive power than MRT <b>models</b> <b>of</b> species <b>abundance</b> or occurrence data.

Furthermore, morphogroups were more robust than biocrust species data, showed a strong response to ecological degradation and were less influenced by environmental variation, and <b>models</b> <b>of</b> morphogroup <b>abundance</b> were more predictive.

Habitat associations of both species were examined using <b>models</b> <b>of</b> <b>abundance</b> within the 95 % density kernel of the Sardinian Warbler's range and also outside this range for Cyprus Warbler. Within the Sardinian Warbler's range, the two species were associated with subtly different scrub habitats. Outside the Sardinian Warbler's range, the Cyprus Warbler differed again in its habitat association, but this probably resulted from marked differences in habitat extent and availability {{in different parts of the}} island rather than from competitive displacement, as none of the habitat or land-use elements differentially associated with Cyprus Warblers was positively associated with Sardinian Warbler occurrence. This suggests that the Sardinian Warbler has exploited a different niche, rather than displacing the endemic species, and has perhaps benefitted from changing land-use patterns, particularly recent fallows and abandoned agriculture, in contrast to the stronger association of Cyprus Warblers with semi-natural scrub. © 2012 The Authors.

Habitat degradation and barriers to migration are considered contributing factors to range contraction that has left just the Pascagoula River drainage population in Mississippi.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three different studies with common goal of understanding the constituents and structures of the universe. The current understanding of galaxy formation is not complete. Cold and hot flows in the galaxies play role in evolution and transportation of elements within halo. Ionized carbon clouds are often observed in the spectrum of back-lighting quasars. I study the clustering properties of the triply ionized carbon clouds from SDSS-III data to determine the minimum mass of the host halo in which the galaxy formation processes produce such clouds. Apart from enabling better understanding of these clouds, the result would help constrain galaxy formation theory and the associated feedback processes. Standard cosmological theory produces an excess of baryonic structure compared to the observed one. Energetic quasars are often envisaged as the process which inject kinetic energy into the structures and halt the structure formation. I study the outflow in SDSS-III quasars through observed velocities of the triply ionized carbon clouds detected in their spectra. Using more accurate <b>modeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>abundance</b> <b>of</b> carbon clouds, I make robust conclusion about properties of outflow systems. Understanding velocities of such outflow helps constrain {{the amount of energy}} injected in the feedback process of quasars and helps in explaining the observed baryonic structure of the Universe. Supernovae Ia enable us to measure their distances at different redshifts. Distances enable us to infer the expansion history of the Universe and measure the current accelerated expansion. The equation-of-state parameter, w, of the dark energy responsible for this acceleration, can be determined from the expansion history.

The impacts of an invading species often vary across systems, making their prediction difficult. When data from multiple invaded sites are available, statistical models can be developed to correlate an invader's distribution and abundance with local environmental variables; such models could then provide managers with useful tools to help prioritize efforts to control the invader. The introduction of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga mussel (D. bugensis) to North America ranks among the most ecologically and economically disruptive aquatic invasions ever documented. While some {{attempts have been made}} to predict zebra mussel occurrence and abundance, none have been made for quagga mussels. Furthermore, few studies have been based on river systems, which possess the bulk of North American freshwater biodiversity.

40|$|Hierarchical <b>modeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>abundance</b> {{in space}} or time using closed-population mark-recapture under {{heterogeneity}} (model M$_{h}$) presents two challenges: (i) finding a flexible likelihood in which abundance appears as an explicit parameter and (ii) fitting the hierarchical model for abundance. The first challenge arises because abundance not only indexes the population size, it also determines {{the dimension of}} the capture probabilities in heterogeneity models. A common approach is to use data augmentation to include these capture probabilities directly into the likelihood and fit the model using Bayesian inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Two such examples of this approach are (i) explicit trans-dimensional MCMC, and (ii) superpopulation data augmentation. The superpopulation approach {{has the advantage of}} simple specification that is easily implemented in BUGS and related software. However, it reparameterizes the model so that abundance is no longer included, except as a derived quantity. This is a drawback when hierarchical models for abundance, or related parameters, are desired. Here, we analytically compare the two approaches and show that they are more closely related than might appear superficially. We exploit this relationship to specify the model in a way that allows us to include abundance as a parameter and that facilitates hierarchical modeling using readily available software such as BUGS.

Co-occurrence patterns {{can be used to}} infer mechanisms of community organization (such as biotic interactions), although it has been traditionally applied to binary presence/absence data. Here, we combine density surface and null <b>models</b> <b>of</b> <b>abundance</b> data as a novel approach to analyze the spatial and seasonal dynamics <b>of</b> <b>abundance</b> and distribution <b>of</b> guanacos (Lama guanicoe) and domestic herbivores in northern Patagonia, in order to visually and analytically compare the dispersion and co-occurrence pattern of ungulates. We found a marked seasonal pattern in {{abundance and}} spatial distribution of L. guanicoe. The guanaco population reached its maximum annual size and spatial dispersion in spring-summer, decreasing up to 6. 5 times in size and occupying few sites of the study area in fall-winter. These results are evidence of the seasonal migration process of guanaco populations, an increasingly rare event for terrestrial mammals worldwide. The maximum number of guanacos estimated for spring (25, 951) is higher than the total population size (10, 000) 20 years ago, probably due to both counting methodology and population growth. Livestock were mostly distributed near human settlements, as expected by the sedentary management practiced by local people. Herbivore distribution was non-random; i. e., guanaco and livestock abundances co-varied negatively in all seasons, more than expected by chance. Segregation degree of guanaco and small-livestock (goats and sheep) was comparatively stronger than that of guanaco and large-livestock, suggesting a competition mechanism between ecologically similar herbivores, although various environmental factors could also contribute to habitat segregation. The new and compelling combination of methods used here is highly useful for researchers who conduct counts of animals to simultaneously estimate population sizes, distributions, assess temporal trends and characterize multi-species spatial interactions...|$|R

40|$|Predicting {{abundance}} {{across a}} species 2 ̆ 7 distribution {{is useful for}} studies of ecology and biodiversity management. <b>Modeling</b> <b>of</b> survey data in relation to environmental variables {{can be a powerful}} method for extrapolating abundances across a species 2 ̆ 7 distribution and, consequently, calculating total abundances and ultimately trends. Research in this area has demonstrated that <b>models</b> <b>of</b> <b>abundance</b> are often unstable and produce spurious estimates, and until recently our ability to remove detection error limited the development <b>of</b> accurate <b>models.</b> The N-mixture model accounts for detection and abundance simultaneously and has been a significant advance in abundance modeling. Case studies that have tested these new models have demonstrated success for some species, but doubt remains over the appropriateness <b>of</b> standard N-mixture <b>models</b> for many species. Here we develop the N-mixture model to accommodate zero-inflated data, a common occurrence in ecology, by employing zero-inflated count models. To our knowledge, this is the first application of this method to modeling count data. We use four variants <b>of</b> the N-mixture <b>model</b> (Poisson, zero-inflated Poisson, negative binomial, and zero-inflated negative binomial) to model abundance, occupancy (zero-inflated models only) and detection probability of six birds in South Australia. We assess models by their statistical fit and the ecological realism of the parameter estimates. Specifically, we assess the statistical fit with AIC and assess the ecological realism by comparing the parameter estimates with expected values derived from literature, ecological theory, and expert opinion. We demonstrate that, despite being frequently ranked the “best model” according to AIC, the negative binomial variants of the N-mixture often produce ecologically unrealistic parameter estimates. The zero-inflated Poisson variant is preferable to the negative binomial variants of the N-mixture, as it models an ecological mechanism rather than a statistical phenomenon and generates reasonable parameter estimates. Our results emphasize the need to include ecological reasoning when choosing appropriate models and highlight the dangers <b>of</b> <b>modeling</b> statistical properties <b>of</b> the data. We demonstrate that, to obtain ecologically realistic estimates <b>of</b> <b>abundance,</b> occupancy and detection probability, it is essential to understand the sources of variation in the data and then use this information to choose appropriate error distributions.

A version of this was {{produced}} two years ago (Taylor, Dudhia and Rodgers, / 1 / - hereafter called paper 1) and in this new paper we consider some of the possible error sources in more detail, as well as long-term trends. The principal source of error in the SAMS retrievals is thought to be the use of climatological ozone profiles to invert the temperature profile data. However, we find that the effect is too small, and of the opposite sign, to explain the discrepancies between satellite and in-situ measurements, noted in paper 1. As expected, no systematic trends which exceed the estimated error in the data are found in either methane or nitrous oxide. © 1989...|$|R
40|$|We {{have been}} {{studying}} the dissociative recombination (DR) of HeH(+) with an electron {{with the goal of}} calculating accurate cross sections and rate coefficients to allow for the accurate <b>modelling</b> <b>of</b> the <b>abundance</b> <b>of</b> HeH(+) in planetary nebulae and supernova envelopes. A unique feature of the HeH potential curves is that none of the neutral states cross the ion curve. This required a new approach to the calculation of DR cross sections and rate coefficients that had not yet appeared in the literature. Because of the lack of a potential curve crossing, the initial electron capture occurs by Born-Oppenheimer breakdown, i. e. by the interaction of the motion of the incoming electron with the nuclear motion. This same mechanism also drives DR in H 3 (+) and the methods developed and described below for HeH(+) DR will be used for the future calculation of H 3 (+) DR...|$|R
40|$|Spatially {{explicit}} <b>models</b> <b>of</b> animal <b>abundance</b> are {{a critical}} tool to inform conservation planning and management. However, they require {{the availability of}} spatially diffuse environmental predictors <b>of</b> <b>abundance,</b> which may be challenging especially in complex and heterogeneous habitats. This is particularly the case for tropical mammals, such as nonhuman primates, that depend on multi-layered and species-rich tree canopy coverage, which is usually measured through a limited sample of ground plots. We developed an approach that calibrates remote-sensing imagery to ground measurements of tree density to derive basal area, in turn used {{as a predictor of}} primate density based on published models. We applied generalized linear models (GLM) to relate 9. 8 ha ground samples of tree basal area to various metrics extracted from Landsat 8 imagery. We tested the potential of this approach for spatial inference of animal density by comparing the density predictions for an endangered colobus monkey, to previous estimates from field transect counts, measured basal area, and other predictors <b>of</b> <b>abundance.</b> The best GLM had high accuracy and showed no significant difference between predicted and observed values of basal area. Our species distribution model yielded predicted primate densities that matched those based on field measurements. Results show the potential of using open-access and global remote sensing data to derive an important predictor <b>of</b> animal <b>abundance</b> in tropical forests and in turn to make spatially explicit inference on animal density. This approach has important, inherent applications as it greatly magnifies the relevance <b>of</b> <b>abundance</b> <b>modeling</b> for informing conservation. This is especially true for threatened species living in heterogeneous habitats where spatial patterns <b>of</b> <b>abundance,</b> in relation to habitat and/or human disturbance factors, are often complex and, management decisions - such as improving forest protection - may need to be focused on priority areas...|$|R
