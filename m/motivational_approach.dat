Therefore, this study examined the relationships between job design, performance and job satisfaction.. Methods and Materials: This cross - sectional study was done in 11 branches of one of the bank in Hamadan. Job Design Questionnaire, Job Satisfaction Questionnaires and Bank Performance Indicator were used in order to collect data. spearman correlation coefficient was used for determining the correlation between each two variables.. Results: This study showed that the <b>motivational</b> <b>approach</b> was the minimum approach (3. 8 %), and the mechanical approach, was the dominant approach (74. 7 %) in the study branches and the majority of branches had an average level of job satisfaction. Moreover, there was a significant positive correlation between job design (motivational and cognitive approaches) and job satisfaction. In addition, the results showed that between job design (<b>Motivational</b> <b>approach)</b> and satisfaction were significantly correlated with performance, (p = 0. 05)..

"How {{we know what}} isn’t so: The fallibility of human reason in everyday life. " New York: The Free Press. ]. The influence of such motivational factors on delusions, which are instances of pathological misbelief, has tended however to be neglected by certain prevailing models of delusion formation and maintenance. This paper explores a distinction between two general classes of theoretical explanation for delusions; the motivational and the deficit. <b>Motivational</b> <b>approaches</b> view delusions as extreme instances of self-deception; as defensive attempts to relieve pain and distress. Deficit approaches, in contrast, view delusions as the consequence of defects in the normal functioning of belief mechanisms, underpinned by neuroanatomical or neurophysiological abnormalities. It is argued that although {{there are good reasons}} to be sceptical of motivational theories (particularly in their more floridly psychodynamic manifestations), recent experiments confirm that motives are important causal forces where delusions are concerned. It is therefore concluded that the most comprehensive account of delusions will involve a theoretical unification of both <b>motivational</b> and deficit <b>approaches.</b> 10 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Company {{executives}} rely on {{new product}} development teams {{to carry out}} their directives and make decisions according to management 2 ̆ 7 s goals. However, team members bring their own motivational perspectives to strategic decisions. This research examines how individual and leadership motivations influence a dyadic team 2 ̆ 7 s new product decisions. Specifically, this article investigates how matching vs. mismatched motivations between team members affect new product number, type, and timing decisions. In addition, this study asks how effective leadership-provided motivations are in guiding teams 2 ̆ 7 new product decisions. A set of hypotheses is developed using regulatory focus theory, which identifies basic motivational differences in individuals (i. e., promotion vs. prevention focus) and their effects on decision making. The hypotheses examine the effects of regulatory focus match vs. mismatch within teams on the likelihood to introduce new products, the timing of new product introductions, and the types of new products introduced. To test the hypotheses, a controlled, yet realistic product management simulation is employed. A total of 124 undergraduate seniors (83 women and 41 men) at a large public university enrolled in a marketing management capstone course participated in this study for partial course credit. Utilizing two-person teams engaged in a business simulation ensured an appropriate level of controlled complexity in the decision making task, while allowing the phenomena of interest to be isolated and tested. Results show that when dyads share the same <b>motivational</b> <b>approach</b> (regulatory focus match), leadership-prescribed goal pursuit strategies are largely ineffective. Only dyads that do not share the same <b>motivational</b> <b>approach</b> to decision making (regulatory focus mismatch) make new product decisions consistent with leadership-prescribed goal pursuit strategies. For regulatory focus match dyads, the results demonstrate that a promotion focus (when compared to a prevention focus) leads to greater numbers of new products introduced, faster new product introductions, and more novel new product introductions. For new product managers, these results carry important implications. Which new product opportunities to invest in and which to forgo is presumably determined by the strategic direction given to teams by top management. Results suggest that when team members share the same <b>motivational</b> <b>approach,</b> this not only influences new product decisions, but also diminishes or eliminates the influence top management can exert on new product decisions. Such “isolation” from leadership influences {{does not have to be}} detrimental. For example, companies that seek to insulate new product development teams from influences from the top, such as is the case in many new venture incubations, would be well served to staff those teams ensuring a promotion focus match...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} of a comprehensive <b>motivational</b> <b>approach</b> in reducing blood pressure in Italian patients with hypertension. METHOD: Two hundred and ninety-two first visit patients with hypertension without diabetes and dyslipidemia and with BMI < 28 were enrolled. One hundred and forty-two {{were randomly assigned to}} a Control group (C) and 150 to an Intervention group (I). A ten-multiple-choice questionnaire was developed to evaluate the effect of the intervention on lifestyle modification. Patients were given the questionnaire, had their BP measured and drug therapy registered before educational intervention and 12 months later. Group I patients participated in the focus group and in the role play 2 and 4 months, respectively, after recruitment. Group C patients received the oral information. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Blood pressure values and lifestyle modification. An intention to treat analysis was undertaken. Analysis was performed using SPSS version 15. 0. RESULTS: Of the 150 group I patients, 58 participated in both focus group and role play, 30 participated only in focus group and the remaining 62 never participated. After 12 months, there was a significant reduction of BP for group I (P < 0. 001) and a significant reduction only for systolic BP in group C (P = 0. 01). Diastolic BP and systolic BP decreased more markedly in group I than in group C, with P < 0. 001 for both. We found a significant improvement of lifestyle modification after 12 months of follow-up concerning some aspects in both groups. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that a <b>motivational</b> <b>approach</b> is a powerful tool for achieving better blood pressure control and is an essential skill for all healthcare professionals...|$|E

However, {{from the perspective of}} the employer attempting to implement a trip reduction program, it is often difficult to determine what type of intervention (or combination of interventions) would be most effective. This article reviews the literature on strategies for changing commuter behavior, with a focus on techniques that an employer might use (i. e., rather than a focus on physical or regulatory barriers to non-conserving behavior). Behavior change strategies are organized into three categories: informational <b>approaches,</b> positive <b>motivational</b> <b>approaches,</b> and coercive approaches. In general, research in commuter behavior change has focused on the application of external, tangible motivation (e. g., financial incentives or disincentives) to the exclusion of self-initiated, less tangible factors (e. g., commitment and self-monitoring techniques). The implications of this bias are discussed along with suggestions for future research. ...|$|R
