40|$|Abstract Background A {{fracture}} of the distal radius is a commonly occurring fracture and {{accounts for a}} third of all fractures in the elderly. Thus far, one year estimates of pain and disability following a {{fracture of}} the distal radius have been reported on Canadian populations. The primary aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the prevalence of pain and disability in a UK population one year post fracture of the distal radius. Methods A cross-sectional survey was undertaken, of all subjects suffering a fracture of the distal radius between October 2005 and February 2006 in Nottingham, UK. Primary outcomes used were the VAS for pain and the DASH for disability. Prevalence of pain and disability were calculated and odds ratios presented for associations between demographics, pain and disability. Results 93 / 264 (35 %) subjects responded to the questionnaire. 6 subjects did not fulfill the inclusion criteria and were excluded from further analysis. 11 % of subjects reported <b>moderate</b> <b>to</b> very <b>severe</b> pain. 16 % of subjects reported <b>moderate</b> <b>to</b> very <b>severe</b> disability. Statistically significant associations were found between pain medication usage for the wrist fracture and <b>moderate</b> <b>to</b> very <b>severe</b> pain (OR 11. 20, 95 % CI 2. 05 – 61. 23). <b>Moderate</b> <b>to</b> very <b>severe</b> disability was associated with older age (OR 6. 53, 95 %CI 1. 65 – 25. 90) and pain medication usage for the wrist fracture (OR 4. 75, 95 % CI 1. 38 – 16. 37). Working was associated with a reduction in risk of <b>moderate</b> <b>to</b> very <b>severe</b> disability (OR 0. 14, 95 % CI 0. 03 – 0. 67). Conclusion This study demonstrates that there are a small proportion of patients who are still suffering <b>moderate</b> <b>to</b> very <b>severe</b> pain and disability one year post fracture of the distal radius. The study also demonstrates that there are significant associations between characteristics of the patients and the level of pain and disability. This highlights the need for further research into the most appropriate management of these patients in order to reduce this burden of pain and disability, particularly as this is a predominantly elderly patient group. </p...|$|R

The storm surge and strong waves caused <b>moderate</b> <b>to</b> <b>severe</b> damage to roads along the panhandle. Strong winds caused power outages to 500people in Walton, Washington and Bay counties. The storm spawned a weak tornado in Navarre, Florida, causing minor damage on its 0.1-mile (0.2-km) path.

40|$|Objective: Investigate {{the effect}} of lower {{extremity}} exercise on maximum lower extremity muscle strength and physical capacity in COPD patients. Material and Method: Twenty <b>moderate</b> <b>to</b> very <b>severe</b> COPD patients were allocated into trained and control groups. The trained group received eight weeks of lower extremity functional exercise including forward step up, lateral step up, heel raise, and lunge at home. Maximum muscle strength and Six Minute Walk Distance (6 MWD) assessments were performed at pre-training, week 4, and week 8 in hospital settings. Results: There {{was no significant difference}} between trained and control groups in maximum muscle strength and 6 MWD at the beginning of the program. However, there was a significant improvement in 6 MWD after eight weeks of training, whereas there were no significant differences in the control group. Conclusion: Functional exercise may improve physical capacity in <b>moderate</b> <b>to</b> very <b>severe</b> COPD patients. It is beneficial and easy to perform at home...|$|R

Dual bronchodilation with umeclidinium/vilanterol (UMEC/VI; 62. 5 / 25  µg) is a novel LAMA/LABA combination approved for maintenance treatment for patients with COPD. Objective: The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the cost-effectiveness of maintenance treatment with UMEC/VI compared with tiotropium (TIO) 18  µg, open dual LAMA + LABA treatment, or no long-acting bronchodilator treatment in patients with <b>moderate</b> <b>to</b> very <b>severe</b> COPD. Methods: A Markov model was developed to estimate the costs and outcomes associated with UMEC/VI treatment in patients with <b>moderate</b> <b>to</b> very <b>severe</b> COPD (GSK study number: HO- 13 - 13411). Clinical efficacy, costs, utilities, and mortality obtained from the published literature were used as the model inputs. Costs are presented in US dollars based on 2015 prices. The model outputs are total costs, drug costs, other medical costs, number of COPD exacerbations, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs and outcomes were discounted at a 3 % annual rate. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the effects of changing parameters on the uncertainty of the results. Results: UMEC/VI treatment for <b>moderate</b> <b>to</b> very <b>severe</b> COPD was associated with lower lifetime medical costs ($ 82, 344) compared with TIO ($ 88, 822), open dual LAMA + LABA treatment ($ 114, 442), and no long-acting bronchodilator ($ 86, 751). Fewer exacerbations were predicted to occur with UMEC/VI treatment compared with no long-acting bronchodilator treatment. UMEC/VI provided an 0. 11 and 0. 25 increase in QALYs compared with TIO and no long-acting bronchodilator treatment, and as such, dominated these cost-effectiveness analyses. Sensitivity analyses confirmed that the results were robust. Conclusion: The results from this model suggest that UMEC/VI treatment would be dominant compared with TIO and no long-acting bronchodilator treatment, and less costly than open dual LAMA + LABA treatment in patients with <b>moderate</b> <b>to</b> very <b>severe</b> COPD.

5|$|Alveolar osteitis is a {{complication}} of tooth extraction (especially lower wisdom teeth) {{in which the}} blood clot is not formed or is lost, leaving the socket where the tooth used to be empty, and bare bone is exposed to the mouth.

It normally starts two to {{four days after the}} extraction, and may last 10–40 days. Healing is delayed, and it is treated with local anesthetic dressings, which are typically required for five to seven days. There is some evidence that chlorhexidine mouthwash used prior to extractions prevents alveolar osteitis.|$|E
