40|$|Abstract — In steel-making plants, {{there are}} many processes, such as the blast furnace, in which the {{internal}} state is not directly observable. Automation of such processes based on process visualization is an urgent issue. Because the number of sensors is limited, the state estimation utilizing partial sensor information is necessary. We developed a technique which visualizes the whole temperature distribution of a shaft furnace by combining the sensor information and a nonlinear <b>model</b> <b>calculation.</b> Assuming {{that the difference between}} the <b>model</b> <b>calculation</b> and actual data derives from the fluctuation of unknown parameters which cannot be measured online, the parameters are estimated by a particle filter. This way, a robust state estimation logic was established. This technique was implemented and evaluated in a ferro-coke pilot plant at JFE Steel Corporation.
