Local assessments of geoelectric field estimation have been performed at various places around the world (e.g., Boteler 2001; Viljanen et al. 2013; Torta et al. 2014). In addition to direct monitoring of the geoelectric field, one can estimate the geoelectric field though characterizing and mapping the behavior of the Earth’s ground-level geomagnetic field across broad geographic regions (e.g., Love et al. 2016) and characterizing an impedance (e.g., Chave 2012) at a given location, which is dependent on the 3 -dimensional conductivity distribution of the Earth’s interior (e.g., Bedrosian and Feucht 2014; Meqbel et al. 2014; Alekseev et al. 2015).

In regions of near-surface inhomogeneity this condition is not fulfilled, and in extreme cases each electrode may be in contact with surface material of different resistivity. It is therefore suggested that voltages, rather than electric fields, should be computed in the two-dimensional modelling of such regions in the B-polarization mode, and that magnetotellunc impedance calculations for comparison with real data should be based on voltages. A method for modifying an existing finite difference program is described, and sample calculations of voltage differences in the control model of Weaver, LeQuang and Fischer are checked against the exact analytic results that can be obtained.

We compare the structural model obtained from the interpretation of the seismic data with the geoelectrical model resulting from the MT data. The models correlate well in the surroundings of the CO 2 injection area with the major structural differences observed related to the presence of faults. The combination of the two methods allowed a more detailed characterization of the faults, defining their geometry, and fluid flow characteristics, which are key for the risk assessment of the storage site. Moreover, we use the well-log data of the existing wells to derive resistivity–velocity relationships for the subsurface and compute a 3 -D velocity model of the site using the 3 -D resistivity model as a reference. The derived velocity model is compared to both the predicted and logged velocity in the injection and monitoring wells, for an overall assessment of the computed resistivity–velocity relationships. The major differences observed are explained by the different resolution of the compared geophysical methods. Finally, the derived velocity model for the near surface is compared with the velocity model used for the static corrections in the seismic data. The results allowed extracting information about the characteristics of the shallow unconsolidated sediments, suggesting possible clay and water content variations. The good correlation of the velocity models derived from the resistivity–velocity relationships and the well-log data demonstrate the potential of the combination of the two methods for characterizing the subsurface, in terms of its physical properties (velocity, resistivity) and structural/reservoir characteristics. This work explores the compatibility of the seismic and <b>magnetotelluric</b> <b>methods</b> across scales highlighting the importance of joint interpretation in near surface and reservoir characterization...|$|R
