40|$|Mercury and arsenic {{pollution}} {{has been}} recognized as a potential environmental and public health problem for over 40 years. The major source of exposure to mercury and arsenic for humans is the ingestion of sea food. Concentrations of mercury and arsenic in the muscle samples of green tiger shrimp (Penaeus semisulcatus) from the Persian Gulf were determined by cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry. Concentrations of metals in muscle samples were 49 – 115 mg kg 1 for mercury, 115 – 131 mg kg 1 for arsenic, with means of 82. 7 and 251. 6 mg kg 1, respectively. Statistical analysis showed no significant difference of mercury and arsenic concentration in shrimp muscles between selected stations (Bushehr, Khuzestan, and Hormozgan provinces). No {{significant difference was found}} among heavy metal contents of male and female shrimps.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} method {{development}} for the simultaneous determination of methylmercury MeHgþ) and inorganic mercury (iHg) species in seafood samples. The study focused on the extraction and quantification of MeHgþ (the most toxic species) by liquid chromatography coupled to on-line UV irradiation and cold vapour atomic fluorescence spectroscopy (LC-UV-CV-AFS), using HCl 4 mol/L as the extractant agent. Accuracy of the method has been verified by analysing three certified reference materials and different spiked samples. The values found for total Hg and MeHgþ for the CRMs {{did not differ significantly}} from certified values at a 95 % confidence level, and recoveries between 85 % and 97 % for MeHgþ, based on spikes, were achieved. The detection limits (LODs) obtained were 0. 001 mg Hg/kg for total <b>mercury,</b> 0. 0003 <b>mg</b> Hg/kg for MeHgþ and 0. 0004 mg Hg/kg for iHg. The quantification limits (LOQs) established were 0. 003 mg Hg/kg for total <b>mercury,</b> 0. 0010 <b>mg</b> Hg/kg for MeHgþ and 0. 0012 mg Hg/kg for iHg. Precision for each mercury species was established, being 12 % in terms of RSD in all cases. Finally, the developed method was applied to 24 seafood samples from different origins and total mercury contents. The concentrations for Total Hg, MeHg and iHg ranged from 0. 07 to 2. 33, 0. 003 - 2. 23 and 0. 006 - 0. 085 mg Hg/kg, respectively.

5000|$|In 1951, {{under the}} {{direction}} of recording engineer C. Robert (Bob) Fine and recording director David Hall, Mercury Records initiated a recording technique using a single microphone to record symphony orchestras. Fine had for several years used a single microphone for various Mercury small-ensemble classical recordings produced by John Hammond and later Mitch Miller (indeed, Miller, using his full name of Mitchell Miller, made several recordings as a featured oboe player in the late 1940s for Mercury). The first record in this new Mercury Olympian Series was Pictures at an Exhibition performed by Rafael Kubelík and the Chicago Symphony. The group that became the most famous using this technique was the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra, which, under the leadership of conductor Antal Doráti, made a series of classical albums that were well reviewed and sold briskly, including the first-ever complete recordings of Tchaikovsky's ballets Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty, and The Nutcracker. Dorati's 1954 one-mic monaural recording (<b>Mercury</b> <b>MG</b> 50054) and 1958 three-mic stereo rerecording (<b>Mercury</b> <b>MG</b> 50054) of Tchaikovsky's [...] "1812 Overture" [...] included dramatic overdub recordings of 1812-era artillery and the bells of the Yale University Carillon. A stereo release in 1960 featured new recordings of the cannon shots, and the bells of the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Carillon at The Riverside Church in Chicago. Besides Mercury's mono and stereo versions of the 1812, only one other classical album rang up Gold Record sales in the 1950s in the U.S. The recording of the 1812 Overture is {{considered by many to be}} one of the best performances of that work and was still in reissue in 2011, nearly 60 years after its first release.|$|E

40|$|Though {{heavy metal}} such as mercury is toxic to plants and microorganisms, the {{synergistic}} activity between them may offer benefit for surviving. In this study, a mercury-reducing bacterium, Photobacterium spp. strain MELD 1, with an MIC of 33 mg x kg(- 1) mercury was isolated from a severely mercury and dioxin contaminated rhizosphere soil of reed (Phragmites australis). While the whole genome sequencing of MELD 1 confirmed {{the presence of}} a mer operon, the mercury reductase MerA gene showed 99 % sequence identity to Vibrio shilloni AK 1 and implicates its route resulted from the event of horizontal gene transfer. The efficiency of MELD 1 to vaporize <b>mercury</b> (25 <b>mg</b> x kg(- 1), 24 h) and its tolerance to toxic metals and xenobiotics such as lead, cadmium, pentachlorophenol, pentachloroethylene, 3 -chlorobenzoic acid, 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9 -hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin is promising. Combination of a long yard bean (Vigna unguiculata ssp. Sesquipedalis) and strain MELD 1 proved beneficial in the phytoprotection of mercury in vivo. The effect of mercury (Hg) on growth, distribution and tolerance was examined in root, shoot, leaves and pod of yard long bean with and without the inoculation of strain MELD 1. The model plant inoculated with MELD 1 had significant increases in biomass, root length, seed number, and increased mercury uptake limited to roots. Biolog plate assay were used to assess the sole-carbon source utilization pattern of the isolate and Indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) productivity was analyzed to examine if the strain could contribute to plant growth.
