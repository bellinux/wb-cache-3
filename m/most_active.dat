5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>active</b> Western Pacific typhoon {{season was}} in 1964, when 39storms of {{tropical}} storm strength formed. Only 15 seasons had 30 or more storms developing since reliable records began. The least activity {{seen in the}} northwest Pacific Ocean was during the 2010 Pacific typhoon season, when only 14tropical storms and seven typhoons formed. In the Philippines, the <b>most</b> <b>active</b> season, since 1945, for tropical cyclone strikes was 1993 when nineteen tropical cyclones moved through the country. There was only one tropical cyclone that moved through the Philippines in 1958. The 2004 Pacific typhoon season was the busiest for Okinawa since 1957.

5|$|Animals {{that are}} <b>most</b> <b>active</b> {{at dawn and}} dusk, when {{temperatures}} are cooler than mid-day, are called crepuscular. The subdued morning and evening light helps make them less visible to predators, but is bright enough {{to allow them to}} locate food. Some animals are crepuscular mainly because their prey is. Crepuscular animals in the area include mule deer, coyotes, porcupines, mountain cottontails, jackrabbits, and many songbirds.|$|E

5|$|Fishers are {{generally}} crepuscular, being <b>most</b> <b>active</b> {{at dawn and}} dusk. They are active year-round. Fishers are solitary, associating with other fishers only for mating purposes. Males become more active during mating season. Females are least active during pregnancy and gradually increase activity after birth of their kits.|$|E
5|$|Hualālai is {{the third}} <b>most</b> <b>active</b> volcano making up the island of Hawaii, behind Kīlauea and Mauna Loa.

5|$|Mayon Volcano, the Philippines <b>most</b> <b>active</b> volcano. It {{has been}} the site of many {{different}} types of eruptions, Peléan included. Approximately 40 ravines radiate from the summit and provide pathways for frequent pyroclastic flows and mudslides to the lowlands below. Mayon's most violent eruption occurred in 1814 and was responsible for over 1200 deaths.|$|E
5|$|Mount St. Helens is geologically young {{compared}} with the other major Cascade volcanoes. It formed only within the past 40,000 years, and the pre-1980 summit cone began rising about 2,200 years ago.

5|$|Nearly {{one-third of}} the world's {{tropical}} cyclones form within the western Pacific. This makes this basin the <b>most</b> <b>active</b> on Earth. Pacific typhoons have formed year round, with peak months from August to October. The peak months correspond {{to that of the}} Atlantic hurricane seasons. Along with a high storm frequency, this basin also features the most globally intense storms on record. One of the most recent busy seasons was 2013. Tropical cyclones form in any month of the year across the northwest Pacific Ocean, and concentrate around June and November in the northern Indian Ocean. The area just northeast of the Philippines is the <b>most</b> <b>active</b> place on Earth for tropical cyclones to exist. Across the Philippines themselves, activity reaches a minimum in February, before increasing steadily through June, and spiking from July through October, with September being the <b>most</b> <b>active</b> month for tropical cyclones across the archipelago. Activity falls off significantly in November, although Typhoon Haiyan, the strongest Philippine typhoon on record, was a November typhoon. The most frequently impacted areas of the Philippines by tropical cyclones are northern and central Luzon and eastern Visayas. A ten-year average of satellite determined precipitation showed that at least 30percent of the annual rainfall in the northern Philippines could be traced to tropical cyclones, while the southern islands receive less than 10percent of their annual rainfall from tropical cyclones. The genesis and intensity of typhoons are also modulated by slow variation of the sea surface temperature and circulation features following a near-10-year frequency.|$|E

5|$|River otters {{are active}} year-round, and are <b>most</b> <b>active</b> {{at night and}} during crepuscular hours.

River otters only settle in areas that consist of vegetation, rock piles, and sufficient coverage.|$|E

5|$|The 1985 Pacific {{hurricane}} season {{is the third}} <b>most</b> <b>active</b> Pacific {{hurricane season}} on record. It officially started on May 15, 1985, in the eastern Pacific, and on June 1, 1985, in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1985. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. At the time, the 1985 season was the <b>most</b> <b>active</b> on record in the eastern north Pacific, with 28 tropical cyclones forming. Of those, 24 were named, 13 reached hurricane intensity, and 8 became major hurricanes by attaining Category3 status or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. At that time, the 24 named storms was a record; however, this record was broken seven years later in 1992, and was therefore recognized as the second busiest season within the basin, until it was surpassed exactly thirty years later by the 2015 season.|$|E
