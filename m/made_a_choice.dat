25|$|The {{rules on}} {{litigation}} jurisdiction over contractual matters will apply to disputes arising from civil or commercial international contracts between private-law legal entities or individuals provided that: They are domiciled or headquartered in different member states: At {{least one of}} the parties to the contract is domiciled or headquartered in any member state and, additionally, has <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>choice</b> of jurisdiction in favor of a court in one of the member states. In this case, there must be a reasonable connection between the jurisdiction chosen and the controversy. The scope of the application of the international jurisdiction guidelines over contractual matters excludes the following: legal relationships between bankrupt entities/individuals and their creditors and any other analogous proceedings (especially concordatas composition with creditors); matters under agreements involving family and succession law; social security contracts; administrative contracts; employment contracts; consumer sales contracts; transport contracts; insurance policies; and rights in rem.|$|E

J.D. breaks the moment asking her who was the best singer in her head, much {{to the rest of}} the staff's (and especially Dr. Cox's) dismay. J.D. reflects in voiceover that in musicals everyone get what they want, but in reality, after having <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>choice</b> we may miss the way things were; as Elliot realizes she misses her roommate, Carla realizes she wishes she spent more time with her daughter, and Ms. Miller realizes she misses the music in her head.|$|E

[...] In response, Ann Romney issued her first tweet, saying [...] "I <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>choice</b> {{to stay home and}} raise five boys. Believe me, it was hard work." [...] Rosen apologized the following day [...] [...] Like all presidential candidates' wives, her fashion choices came under scrutiny, with some critics praising her for a contemporary look that avoided standard campaign appearance clichés, while others said she lacked consistency and {{did not seem to be}} using the services of a stylist. On August 28, Romney gave a prime-time speech before the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida, in which she stressed her own background and her family experiences, in an appeal to women voters. [...] By early October, she and son Tagg had convinced the campaign to spend more time emphasizing her husband's personal nature and character, rather than simply present issue and record arguments against Obama. Romney sparked discussion of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania being in play when she campaigned at Elizabethtown College.|$|E
500|$|Breakout {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{earning a}} collective score of 66 out of 100 on Metacritic. Heather Phares of Allmusic commented that Breakout title expresses its [...] "purpose nicely" [...] though {{the music was}} not drastically different from Hannah Montana's, adding, [...] "only a handful of songs truly break out from the Montana mold". Though not being impressed by [...] "nothing [...] left to chance", she concluded, [...] "Even if these songs are derivative of much more established pop divas ] and , they provide clues {{to the kind of}} company Cyrus aims to keep. And while Breakout isn't as much of a breakthrough as it could be, it still moves Miley closer to an identity and career outside of Hannah." [...] Kerri Mason of Billboard wrote, [...] "While it's still age-appropriate for minors, Breakout is for the big kids too" [...] and complimented Cyrus for being a [...] "natural-born popstar." [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe felt Cyrus mostly succeeded while [...] "trying to please most of the people most of the time" [...] on Breakout. She summarized, [...] "With Breakout, Cyrus has clearly <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>choice</b> to break from the shiny, happy 'Hannah Montana' character, but she hasn't scuffed her sound up so much that her fans won't recognize that she's just being Miley." [...] Chris William of Entertainment Weekly graded the album a B and noted that {{the first half of the}} album was [...] "fun" [...] but the second half became [...] "overly ballad-heavy," [...] assuming that was the more mature side of Cyrus she had promised. Miakel Wood of the Los Angeles Times stated, [...] "In that respect, Breakout is unlikely fodder for the razzle-dazzle road shows and 3-D concert films to come. As a portrait of the artist as a young malcontent, though, it's rarely less than fascinating." ...|$|E

2500|$|Aside from points {{where the}} story {{dictates}} the player's action, navigating the timelines is a non-linear process.

Experience points and currency earned in battles are carried over between timelines. Events across each timeline are tied to side quests the player can complete. While there are multiple endings depending on the path taken by the player, there are only two canon endings; the standard version, and an extended version unlocked by completing all side quests.|$|E
2500|$|The Stevens dissent {{seems to}} rest on four main points of disagreement: that the Founders {{would have made the}} {{individual}} right aspect of the Second Amendment express if that was what was intended; that the [...] "militia" [...] preamble and exact phrase [...] "to keep and bear arms" [...] demands the conclusion that the Second Amendment touches on state militia service only; that many lower courts' later [...] "collective-right" [...] reading of the Miller decision constitutes stare decisis, which may only be overturned at great peril; and that the Court has not considered gun-control laws (e.g., the National Firearms Act) unconstitutional. The dissent concludes, [...] "The Court would have us believe that over 200 years ago, the Framers <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>choice</b> to limit the tools available to elected officials wishing to regulate civilian uses of weapons....

2500|$|Chona {{returned}} to Northern Rhodesia in December 1958. During his absence from Northern Rhodesia, politics had moved forward on several fronts. The White-dominated Central African Federation (CAF) {{had been established}} on 1 August 1953, in spite of feeble opposition from the Black population through the African National Congress (ANC), led by Nkumbula and Kaunda. The two leaders drifted apart as Nkumbula became increasingly influenced by White liberals and was seen as being willing to compromise {{on the issue of}} Black majority rule. Eventually Kaunda broke from the ANC in October 1958 and formed the Zambia African National Congress (ZANC), with Nkumbula remaining as leader of the ANC. Chona {{had been a member of}} ANC while in London and he had not <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>choice</b> between the two factions. Due to ZANC's militancy and its unwillingness to compromise on the issue of [...] "independence now", Kaunda and other leaders of the new party were detained by the CAF authorities, and ZANC was banned in March 1959. Chona decided to take active part in the operations of the still-legal ANC, but his challenge to Nkumbula's cautious leadership of the party resulted in a further split.|$|E
2500|$|After a {{brief period}} of leave in Britain during 1958, Burgess took up a further Eastern post, this time at the Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin College in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei. Brunei had been a British {{protectorate}} since 1888, and was not to achieve independence until 1984. In the sultanate, Burgess sketched the novel that, when it was published in 1961, was to be entitled Devil of a State and, although it dealt with Brunei, for libel reasons the action had to be transposed to an imaginary East African territory similar to Zanzibar, named Dunia. In his autobiography Little Wilson and Big God (1987) Burgess wrote:"This novel was, is, about Brunei, which was renamed Naraka, Malay-Sanskrit for 'hell.' Little invention was needed to contrive a large cast of unbelievable characters and a number of interwoven plots. Though completed in 1958, the work was not published until 1961, for what it was worth it was <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>choice</b> of the book society. Heinemann, my publisher, was doubtful about publishing it: it might be libellous. I had to change the setting from Brunei to an East African one. Heinemann was right to be timorous. In early 1958, The Enemy in the Blanket appeared and at once provoked a libel suit." ...|$|E

60|$|About the {{beginning}} of the eighteenth century there lived in Westminster, England, a boy who very early in life <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>choice</b> of a future career. Nearly all boys have ideas upon this subject, and while some think they would like to be presidents or generals of armies, others fancy that they would prefer to be explorers of unknown countries or to keep candy shops.

60|$|It {{was very}} clean already; and the Captain being an orderly man, and {{accustomed}} {{to make things}} ship-shape, converted the bed into a couch, by covering it all over with a clean white drapery.

It might be easier if he would look round, but he went on across the grass and his step was resolute, although his head was bent. Then she got up, and going to her room, sat down trembling. She had let her best chance go; Stephen's resolve would stiffen, for when he had <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>choice</b> he was hard to move. Besides, he had wounded her deeply.

Anxious as he was that both his sons should be permeated by Liberal politics, studious as he had ever been to teach them that the highest duty of those high in rank was to use their authority to elevate those beneath them, still he was hardly less anxious to make them understand that their second duty required them to maintain their own position. It was by feeling this second duty,--by feeling it and performing it,--that they would be enabled to perform the rest. And now both Silverbridge and his girl were bent upon marriages by which they would depart out of their own order! Let Silverbridge marry whom he might, he could not be other than heir to the honours of his family. But by his marriage he might either support or derogate from these honours. And now, having at first <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>choice</b> that was good, he had altered his mind from simple freak, captivated by a pair of bright eyes and an arch smile; and without a feeling in regard to his family, was anxious to take to his bosom the granddaughter of an American day-labourer! ...|$|E
