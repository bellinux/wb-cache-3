5|$|Gandhi {{believed}} that swaraj {{not only can}} be attained with non-violence, it can be run with non-violence. <b>Military</b> <b>is</b> unnecessary, because any aggressor can be thrown out using the method of non-violent non-co-operation. While <b>military</b> <b>is</b> unnecessary in a nation organised under swaraj principle, Gandhi added that a police force is necessary given human nature. However, the state would limit the use of weapons by the police to the minimum, aiming for their use as a restraining force.|$|E

Thereafter, professional <b>military</b> generals <b>were</b> appointed directly by the Carthaginian Senate.|$|R
50|$|At {{first it}} seemed the <b>military</b> <b>was</b> moving {{to take over the}} {{government}} between January 11-13, with unusual troop and naval deployments around the capital. <b>Military</b> establishments <b>were</b> barricaded and rumours spread that the <b>military</b> <b>was</b> preparing to seize power. Rumours also swept the capital that the Military Commander, Commodore Frank Bainimarama, had been arrested by the police on government orders, but the military denied this.|$|R
5|$|The Romanian <b>military</b> <b>is</b> {{undergoing}} a three-stage restructuring. As of 2007, the first short-term stage was completed (reorganisation {{of the command}} system, implementation of the voluntary military service). The year 2015 {{marks the end of}} the second stage (operational integration in NATO and EU), while 2025 is the date when the long-term stage is to be completed (full technical integration in NATO and EU). The stages aim at modernising the structure of the armed forces, reducing the personnel as well as acquiring newer and improved technology that is compatible with NATO standards.|$|E

The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) is a regular participant in RIMPAC maritime exercises.

Japan Business Federation has called on the government to lift the ban on arms exports so that Japan can join multinational projects such as the Joint Strike Fighter.|$|E
5|$|From {{its origin}} as a {{city-state}} {{on the peninsula}} of Italy in the 8th century BC, to its rise as an empire covering much of Southern Europe, Western Europe, Near East and North Africa to its fall in the 5th century AD, the political history of Ancient Rome was closely entwined with its military history. The core of the campaign history of the Roman <b>military</b> <b>is</b> an aggregate of different accounts of the Roman military's land battles, from its initial defense against and subsequent conquest of the city's hilltop neighbors on the Italian peninsula, to the ultimate struggle of the Western Roman Empire for its existence against invading Huns, Vandals and Germanic tribes. These accounts were written by various authors throughout and after {{the history of the}} Empire. Following the First Punic War, naval battles were less significant than land battles to the military history of Rome due to its encompassment of lands of the periphery and its unchallenged dominance of the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E

5|$|Le Guin was {{strongly}} opposed to and {{troubled by the}} Vietnam War, a reaction which played a large part {{in the tone of}} the novel. The tone of the novel is often harsh and hard-hitting, playing off the anger in the United States at American military actions in Vietnam. The tension between violence and non-violence {{is a part of the}} dialectic theme in the novel, of a constant tension between opposites. Through most of the novel, the Terran <b>military</b> <b>is</b> in control of the colony, despite Raj Lyubov's good intentions. Davidson is the most prominent example of the oppressiveness of the military government. There are intentional parallels drawn between the Terran colonizers and the US intervention in Vietnam; the anti-interventionist tone of the novel was in sharp contrast to other science-fiction novels about war written around the same period. For example, the high use of drugs amongst US troops in Vietnam is represented by the use of hallucinogens amongst the Terran soldiers, which Le Guin portrays as the norm on the colony.|$|E

25|$|Civil–military {{relations}} (Civ-Mil or CMR) {{describes the}} relationship between civil {{society as a whole}} and the military organization or organizations established to protect it. More narrowly, it describes {{the relationship between}} the civil authority of a given society and its military authority. Studies of civil-military relations often rest on a normative assumption that civilian control of the <b>military</b> <b>is</b> preferable to military control of the state. The principal problem they examine, however, is empirical: to explain how civilian control over the <b>military</b> <b>is</b> established and maintained.|$|E
