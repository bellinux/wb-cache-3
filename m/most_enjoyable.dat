5|$|As Nelson's professional, Constantine was {{immediately}} successful. Although he produced better figures in subsequent years, he considered {{his first season}} at Nelson the <b>most</b> <b>enjoyable</b> of his life, owing to the freedom and excitement of the cricket. In nine years at the club he scored 6,363 runs {{at an average of}} 37.65 and took 776 wickets at 9.50. His highest score was 192, and his best bowling figures were ten wickets for ten runs. In each season except for 1932, he averaged over 30 with the bat and in 1933 he scored 1,000 runs at an average of over 50. He took over 70 wickets every season and his bowling average never rose above 11.30; in five seasons, he averaged under ten runs per wicket. In 1933 he took 96 wickets, his highest seasonal aggregate, and had he not missed two games to play for the West Indies touring team, would likely have completed the cricketer's double (1,000 runs and 100 wickets), an unprecedented feat in the league.|$|E
5|$|Krøyer's {{paintings}} of Marie between 1888 and 1906 present {{a record of}} the years they spent together. They show some of their <b>most</b> <b>enjoyable</b> times but also hint at the marital tension that increased as time went by. Among the most notable {{paintings of}} her are Summer Evening at Skagen. The Artist's Wife and Dog by the Shore (1892), one of Denmark's most popular works, which shows Marie on the beach with their dog and with the moonlight reflected in the sea, Roses (1893), which depicts her relaxing in the garden, and Summer Evening at Skagen Beach – The Artist and his Wife (1899). Also of note are the depictions of Marie on holiday in Ravello on the Amalfi Coast of Italy in 1890; the portrait for the frieze in the dining room at Skagen's Brøndums Hotel; Chez Moi, a series of watercolours of Marie and the couple's daughter Vibeke in the family homes in Copenhagen and Skagen; and Midsummer Eve Bonfire on Skagen Beach, his last painting of her in which she is shown captured in the firelight with Alfvén.|$|E
5|$|Ordered on 4 March 1858, Invincible {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Arsenal de Toulon on 1 May 1858, {{launched}} on 4 April 1861 and completed in March 1862. In September–October 1863, she conducted tactical trials with other ironclads. While assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet, the ship made a port visit in August 1865 to Brest where the fleet hosted the British Channel Fleet. As part of the festivities, Invincible put on a banquet for the midshipmen of both fleets that was reportedly the noisiest and <b>most</b> <b>enjoyable</b> of the visit. A few days later the French fleet made a reciprocal visit to Portsmouth where it was hosted by the Channel Fleet. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, the ship was sent to defend the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon from Prussian commerce raiders. Built of unseasoned timber, Invincible was in poor shape upon her return and was decommissioned. Condemned on 12 August 1872, the ship was scrapped in 1876 at Cherbourg.|$|E

5|$|Urobuchi {{stated that}} Sayaka was his {{favorite}} character overall, and remarked that her plotline was the <b>most</b> <b>enjoyable</b> to write. Due to her grim fate {{by the end of}} the series, a destiny that Shinbo believed was slightly unfair, he asked Urobuchi if it was possible to change the plot so that Sayaka could be spared. Urobuchi declined, asserting that her death was too integral to the overarching story. Shinbo then inquired if there were any way that she could be brought back to life, admitting he had become very attached to the character. However, Urobuchi again refused, explaining that this would be impossible with regard to the already-established rules governing the story. Shinbo finally acquiesced to this, but remarked that he believed there may have been too large of a burden placed on the characters who were in essence young middle school girls.|$|E

25|$|After a {{few days}} to recover from their flight and {{practice}} in the nets the MCC went to play a Country team at Moora, Western Australia. These country games were popular with the Australian Board of Control as they promoted cricket away from the cities and the tourists as they provided easy games. There were nine such games on the tour and they could pall after a while, but the players were feted by the locals and some regarded them as the <b>most</b> <b>enjoyable</b> part of the tour. The MCC batted first and made 232/7 with John Edrich making 66 with 11 fours, Jim Parks 48, M.J.K. Smith 36, Fred Titmus 36 not out and the spinner Terry Gale 3/57. Ken Higgs (2/8) quickly removed the opener Pascoe for a duck and Gale for 3, but was taken off after four overs as he sank into the soft turf. A young farmer named John McCormack (64) added 122 runs for the next two wickets before being bowled by Fred Titmus (3/34). From 133/3 the country team unexpectedly fell to 150 all out thanks to the leg-spin of Bob Barber whose 0/56 became 5/64 after changing from cricket boots to light shoes. The MCC won by 82 runs, though there is a discrepancy in the scorecard as only two batsmen are recorded being dismissed by Titmus while Barber has six victims.|$|E
