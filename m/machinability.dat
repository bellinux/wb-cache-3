5|$|Lead {{is added}} to copper alloys such as brass and bronze, to improve <b>machinability</b> and for its {{lubricating}} qualities. Being practically insoluble in copper the lead forms solid globules in imperfections throughout the alloy, such as grain boundaries. In low concentrations, as well as acting as a lubricant, the globules hinder the formation of swarf as the alloy is worked, thereby improving <b>machinability.</b> Copper alloys with larger concentrations of lead are used in bearings. The lead provides lubrication, and the copper provides the load-bearing support.|$|E
5|$|Selenium is {{used with}} bismuth in brasses to replace more toxic lead. The {{regulation}} {{of lead in}} drinking water applications with the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 made a reduction of lead in brass necessary. The new brass is marketed under the name EnviroBrass. Like lead and sulfur, selenium improves the <b>machinability</b> of steel at concentrations around 0.15%. Selenium produces the same <b>machinability</b> improvement in copper alloys.|$|E
5|$|Broaching {{works best}} on softer materials, such as brass, bronze, copper alloys, aluminium, graphite, hard rubbers, wood, composites, and plastic. However, {{it still has}} a good <b>machinability</b> rating on mild steels and free {{machining}} steels. When broaching, the <b>machinability</b> rating {{is closely related to}} the hardness of the material. For steels the ideal hardness range is between 16 and 24 Rockwell C (HRC); a hardness greater than HRC 35 will dull the broach quickly. Broaching is more difficult on harder materials, stainless steel and titanium, but is still possible.|$|E
5|$|Commercially, {{the primary}} use of {{tellurium}} is copper and steel alloys, where it improves <b>machinability.</b> Applications in CdTe solar panels and semiconductors also consume a considerable portion of tellurium production.|$|E
5|$|The heavier {{metalloids}} {{continue the}} theme. Arsenic can form alloys with metals, including platinum and copper; {{it is also}} added to copper and its alloys to improve corrosion resistance and appears to confer the same benefit when added to magnesium. Antimony is well known as an alloy-former, including with the coinage metals. Its alloys include pewter (a tin alloy with up to 20% antimony) and type metal (a lead alloy with up to 25% antimony). Tellurium readily alloys with iron, as ferrotellurium (50–58% tellurium), and with copper, {{in the form of}} copper tellurium (40–50% tellurium). Ferrotellurium is used as a stabilizer for carbon in steel casting. Of the non-metallic elements less often recognised as metalloids, selenium—in the form of ferroselenium (50–58% selenium)—is used to improve the <b>machinability</b> of stainless steels.|$|E
5|$|The major {{applications}} of copper are electrical wire (60%), roofing and plumbing (20%), and industrial machinery (15%). Copper is used mostly as a pure metal, but when greater hardness is required, it {{is put into}} such alloys as brass and bronze (5% of total use). For more than two centuries, copper paint has been used on boat hulls to control the growth of plants and shellfish. A {{small part of the}} copper supply is used for nutritional supplements and fungicides in agriculture. Machining of copper is possible, although alloys are preferred for good <b>machinability</b> in creating intricate parts.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} material properties for the dies are thermal shock resistance and softening at elevated temperature; other important properties include hardenability, <b>machinability,</b> heat checking resistance, weldability, availability (especially for larger dies), and cost. The longevity of a die is directly {{dependent on the}} temperature of the molten metal and the cycle time. The dies used in die casting are usually made out of hardened tool steels, because cast iron cannot withstand the high pressures involved, therefore the dies are very expensive, resulting in high start-up costs. Metals that are cast at higher temperatures require dies made from higher alloy steels.|$|E
25|$|The <b>machinability</b> {{rating of}} a {{material}} attempts {{to quantify the}} <b>machinability</b> of various materials. It is expressed as a percentage or a normalized value. The American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) determined <b>machinability</b> ratings {{for a wide variety}} of materials by running turning tests at 180 surface feet per minute (sfpm). It then arbitrarily assigned 160 Brinell B1112 steel a <b>machinability</b> rating of 100%. The <b>machinability</b> rating is determined by measuring the weighed averages of the normal cutting speed, surface finish, and tool life for each material. Note that a material with a <b>machinability</b> rating less than 100% would be more difficult to machine than B1112 and material with a value more than 100% would be easier.|$|E
25|$|The term <b>machinability</b> {{refers to}} {{the ease with which}} a metal can be cut (machined) {{permitting}} the removal of the material with a satisfactory finish at low cost. Materials with good <b>machinability</b> require little power to cut, can be cut quickly, easily obtain a good finish, and do not wear the tooling much; such materials are said to be free machining. The factors that typically improve a material's performance often degrade its <b>machinability.</b> Therefore, to manufacture components economically, engineers are challenged to find ways to improve <b>machinability</b> without harming performance.|$|E
25|$|Aluminium {{is a much}} softer metal than steel, and the {{techniques}} to improve its <b>machinability</b> usually rely on making it more brittle. Alloys 2007, 2011 and 6020 have very good <b>machinability.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} factors {{affecting}} <b>machinability,</b> but no widely accepted way to quantify it. Instead, <b>machinability</b> is often assessed {{on a case-by-case}} basis, and tests are tailored {{to the needs of}} a specific manufacturing process. Common metrics for comparison include tool life, surface finish, cutting temperature, and tool forces and power consumption.|$|E
25|$|Lead {{can improve}} the <b>machinability</b> of steel because it acts as an {{internal}} lubricant in the cutting zone. Since lead has poor shear strength, it allows the chip to slide more freely past the cutting edge. When it is added in small quantities to steel, it can greatly improve its <b>machinability</b> while not significantly affecting the steel's strength.|$|E
25|$|Chromium, {{molybdenum}} {{and other}} alloying metals are often added to steel {{to improve its}} strength. However, most of these metals also decrease <b>machinability.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Machinability</b> ratings {{can be used}} in {{conjunction}} with the Taylor tool life equation, , in order to determine cutting speeds or tool life. It is known that B1112 has a tool life of 60 minutes at a cutting speed of 100 sfpm. If a material has a <b>machinability</b> rating of 70%, it can be determined, with the above knowns, that {{in order to maintain the}} same tool life (60 minutes) the cutting speed must be 70 sfpm (assuming the same tooling is used).|$|E
25|$|Composites {{often have}} the worst <b>machinability</b> because they combine the poor thermal {{conductivity}} of a plastic resin with the tough or abrasive qualities of the fiber (glass, carbon etc.) material.|$|E
25|$|Sulphur {{improves}} the <b>machinability</b> of steel by forming low shear strength inclusions in the cutting zone. These inclusions are stress risers that weaken the steel, {{allowing it to}} deform more easily.|$|E
25|$|<b>Machinability</b> can {{be based}} on the measure of how long a tool lasts. This can be useful when {{comparing}} materials that have similar properties and power consumptions, but one is more abrasive and thus decreases the tool life. The major downfall with this approach is that tool life is dependent on more than just the material it is machining; other factors include cutting tool material, cutting tool geometry, machine condition, cutting tool clamping, cutting speed, feed, and depth of cut. Also, the <b>machinability</b> for one tool type cannot be compared to another tool type (i.e. HSS tool to a carbide tool).|$|E
25|$|The <b>machinability</b> {{of rubber}} and other soft {{materials}} improves {{by using a}} very low temperature coolant, such as liquid carbon dioxide. The low temperatures chill the material prior to cutting so that it cannot deform or stick to the cutting edge. This means less wear on the tools and easier machining.|$|E
25|$|Stainless steels have poor <b>machinability</b> {{compared}} to regular carbon steel {{because they are}} tougher, gummier and tend to work harden very rapidly. Slightly hardening the steel may decrease its gumminess and {{make it easier to}} cut. AISI grades 303 and 416 are easier to machine because of the addition of sulphur and phosphorus.|$|E
25|$|The forces {{required}} for a tool to cut through a material {{is directly related to}} the power consumed. Therefore, tool forces are often given in units of specific energy. This leads to a rating method where higher specific energies equal lower <b>machinability.</b> The advantage of this method is that outside factors have little effect on the rating.|$|E
25|$|Thermoplastics are {{difficult}} to machine because they have poor thermal conductivity. This creates heat that builds up in the cutting zone, which degrades the tool life and locally melts the plastic. Once the plastic melts, it just flows around the cutting edge instead of being removed by it. <b>Machinability</b> can be improved by using high lubricity coolant and keeping the cutting area free of chip build up.|$|E
25|$|The {{surface finish}} is {{sometimes}} {{used to measure}} the <b>machinability</b> of a material. Soft, ductile materials tend to form a built up edge. Stainless steel and other materials with a high strain hardening ability also want to form a built up edge. Aluminium alloys, cold worked steels, and free machining steels, as well as materials with a high shear zone don't tend to form built up edges, so these materials would rank as more machinable.|$|E
25|$|<b>Machinability</b> can be {{difficult}} to predict because machining has so many variables. Two sets of factors are the condition of work materials and the physical properties of work materials. The condition of the work material includes eight factors: microstructure, grain size, heat treatment, chemical composition, fabrication, hardness, yield strength, and tensile strength. Physical properties are those of the individual material groups, such as the modulus of elasticity, thermal conductivity, thermal expansion, and work hardening. Other important factors are operating conditions, cutting tool material and geometry, and the machining process parameters.|$|E
