The first 64-bit SoCs, the Snapdragon 808 and 810, were rushed to market using generic Cortex-A57 and Cortex-A53 cores and suffered from overheating problems and throttling, particularly the 810, which led to Samsung ditching Snapdragon for its Galaxy S6 flagship phone.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} I analyze the {{consequences}} of advertising in the children’s breakfast cereal market. I {{take advantage of the}} prohibition on advertising directed at children in the province of Quebec to examine the nature of advertising and to determine whether the restriction hinders competition. I show that prices are higher in Quebec than in Canadian provinces that permit advertising. This finding suggests that the informative role of advertising dominates any persuasive role, since the most likely explanation is that the restriction prevented firms from announcing products' existence or characteristics and thus from overcoming perceived differentiation. If advertising is informative, restricting it should increase the <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> <b>of</b> older, better-known brands and decrease the <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> <b>of</b> newer and/or less well known brands.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} rate regulation {{on the structure of}} insurance markets for private passenger automobile insurance. The paper argues that states' restrictions on automobile insurers' rates of return will distort the structure of the market by distorting insurers' entry and output decisions. Cross-sectional analysis of the numbers of firms and the relative <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> <b>of</b> firms of different organizational characteristics supports this argument, especially for those states which impose the most stringent regulation. The analysis suggests that increased regulatory stringency lowers the total number of firms selling in the market, and lowers the number of low cost and national firms in the <b>market.</b> The <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> <b>of</b> these latter two groups of firms are also significantly lowered by increased regulatory stringency. These findings hold even after controlling for other factors which may influence the relative prevalence of these firms in the market, and are robust to the assumption that regulatory stringency in a state is itself partially determined by the number and <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> <b>of</b> large, low cost producers. ...|$|R
