30|$|The <b>metallic</b> <b>mordant</b> used in {{the study}} was {{potassium}} aluminum sulfate (PAS) crystals from Brenntag chemical distributor. According to the Safety Data Sheet provided by the distributor, PAS is considered non-hazardous and non-toxic to the environment when disposing by diluting with water and flushing in the sewer (Global Safety Management 2015). Even though PAS is used to purify water, there is environmental concern over disposal of mordant bath effluent into the sewer or land and scholars are thus exploring natural or biomordants as <b>metallic</b> <b>mordant</b> alternates with mixed results (Ismal et al. 2014; Vankar et al. 2008; Windholz 1983). Further, when mordanting is done separately from dyeing it does increase water and thermal energy usage. Reuse and replenishing the mordant bath can assist with this concern.|$|E
30|$|The {{influence}} of PAS on hue and colorfastness had mixed results. The PAS mordant had a warming effect {{on all of}} the dyewoods that was minimized for black walnut after laundering, while eastern redcedar’s cast was reduced after light exposure. Regardless of mordant type, Osage orange darkened from a golden yellow to a tan/brown following exposure to light. Colorfastness to light was enhanced with a PAS mordant for black walnut and eastern redcedar, while Osage orange had a significant difference from laundering but not for light. While any improvement to colorfastness is viewed as positive, the mixed results and subtle overall visual color difference from mordant use {{may not be enough to}} convince dyers to use a <b>metallic</b> <b>mordant</b> with tannin dyestuffs. The use of a mordant does mean another step in the dyeing process that uses water, energy, and may release unbound mordant chemicals into disposal systems, impacting both the environment and health of communities. Further, introduction of <b>metallic</b> <b>mordant</b> use may impact the cultural heritage of traditional dye practices. Conversely, understanding and utilizing a <b>metallic</b> <b>mordant</b> to shift color, improve lightfastness, and understand long term color results may create social value through new knowledge, as well as economic gain by addressing consumer concern over colorfastness of natural dyes.|$|E
30|$|This {{present study}} {{attempts}} to gratify the color fastness properties and produce variety of color using BFS as natural dye together with various <b>metallic</b> <b>mordants.</b> The metals concentration in mordant bath and wastewater were evaluated {{to find the}} ecological aspect during disposal. The levels of trace metals into the finished fabric were also measured to speculate the human health risk.|$|R
30|$|Having said so, natural dyes do {{have some}} {{inherent}} limitations such as poor tinctorial strength, lack of reproducibility, inferior fastness properties and un-exhausted <b>metallic</b> <b>mordants</b> in the residual dye bath posing serious challenges to the environment [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Chemical modification of the natural dyes can overcome some of these inherent challenges to make them preferred choice under prevailing scenario.|$|R
30|$|Being {{primarily}} <b>metallic</b> salts, a <b>mordant</b> {{acts as a}} sort of {{glue that}} fixes fiber firmly with dye resulting in a durable color on the textile substrate. The process of mordanting usually enhanced the performance of dye besides achieving a wide spectrum of colors on both natural and synthetic textile fibers having extended shade ranges associated with colorfastness properties (Kadolph and Casselman 2004). Different types of <b>metallic</b> <b>mordants</b> (such as potash alum, iron, tin, copper and chrome) either individually or in combination are applied to the dyebath of natural colorants as well as henna in order to obtain the desired performance of dyed fibers (Kamel et al. 2011). However, to some extent, these <b>metallic</b> <b>mordants</b> are hazardous and normally generate wastewater that contains residual toxic metal ions from metal salts which may adversely impact the environment as well as public health (Shahid and Mohammad 2013; Lee et al. 2010). Hence, the main objectives of this study were to explore the scope of dyeing polyester fiber with henna dye at a high temperature and pressure without using any mordants followed by the analysis of color strength and colorfastness properties of the resulting dyed fabrics.|$|R
30|$|A mordant is a {{substance}} that can form complexes between dye and fiber to increase affinity, substantivity, and fastness properties (Dean 2014; Haar et al. 2013; Prabhu and Bhute 2012). Potassium aluminum sulfate is the commonly used <b>metallic</b> <b>mordant</b> for protein fibers with aluminum acetate seeing increased use for cellulose fibers (Brown et al. 2010; Haar et al. 2013). The more toxic metallic mordants of copper, tin, and chrome are not typically used by today’s craft and artisan dyer, yet these chemicals are still being included in some natural dye research. Natural or biomordants from aluminum accumulating plants and high tannin content plants are being explored as substitutes for the manufactured metallic mordants along with other alternative materials and methods (Cunningham et al. 2011; Flint 2001; Ismal et al. 2014; Kadolph and Casselman 2004; Vankar et al. 2008). Trees with high tannin content are often classified as a substantive dye which do not require a <b>metallic</b> <b>mordant,</b> but may {{also be used as}} a mordant depending on their tannin amount and chemical structure (Dean 2014; Ismal et al. 2014; Prabhu and Bhute 2012). However, the addition of an aluminum <b>metallic</b> <b>mordant</b> when dyeing with tree parts can improve colorfastness properties and shift color hue (Cardon 2007; Casselman 1993; Doty and Haar 2012).|$|E
30|$|The PAS mordant {{influenced}} color cast, however {{dependent upon}} the dye, the shift may or not remain after exposure to light and laundering. In addition, when visually comparing resulting color, the difference {{may not be enough}} to warrant the use of a PAS for color changing purposes. Elimination of the <b>metallic</b> <b>mordant</b> brings environmental value by reduction of water, thermal energy, and mordant disposal. As well as social health value, by reducing potential exposure of fine particles. Alternatively, there is social value in understanding the subtle influence of PAS on colorcast following dyeing and exposure to light and laundry which contributes to the dyer’s overall knowledge and color expectancy from natural dyes. Which in turn may influence economic value by providing a product that addresses consumer expectations for color consistency.|$|E
30|$|Overall, {{colorfastness}} {{to light}} and laundering findings indicate mixed results for color change when using a PAS mordant for the selected mill waste, however any improvement to colorfastness is considered positive. Thus, using a PAS mordant may be preferable as lightfastness improved for black walnut and eastern redcedar, while washfastness improved for Osage orange. Improved colorfastness properties may enhance sell-ability of dyed products as consumer concern for color longevity is addressed. Environmentally and economically, {{the use of}} a premordant does increase cost and the amount of time, water, and thermal energy required. Future studies could evaluate adding the mordant to the dye bath, instead of as a pretreatment. As noted prior, there is growing concern over disposal of any residual manufactured <b>metallic</b> <b>mordant</b> {{and its impact on the}} environment and community health. As we did not measure the amount of remaining PAS mordant from a 12  % owf mordant bath, we cannot provide insight to this concern. A possible social impact of introducing use of a PAS mordant is that such practice may not be conducive to long standing natural dye traditions and if accepted could change a cultural heritage.|$|E

30|$|The {{demand of}} natural {{colorants}} for the dyeing of textile fibers {{has been increasing}} gradually in recent years due to a growing global ecological awareness as well as a greater emphasis on a cleaner and greener production process. The eco-friendly dyeing of polyester fiber with natural dye henna is a novel approach that has extensively been studied in this article. To this end, the dyeing of polyester fiber with henna dye was conducted at different temperatures without using hazardous <b>metallic</b> <b>mordants.</b> Then the dyeing performance was investigated in terms of depth of shade measurement, analysis of colorimetric properties of color and assessment of color fastness properties of henna dyed polyester fabric samples. The amount of dye absorption by fiber and the resulting depth of shade were found to increase with increasing dyeing temperature. In case of colorfastness properties, all dyed substrates demonstrated excellent fastness ratings against washing, rubbing and perspiration with little to no deterioration of color. Moreover, the detailed morphological study revealed that surface structure of fiber remained unchanged after dyeing at an elevated temperature and pressure. So, the findings suggest that dyeing of polyester fiber with henna dye without any <b>metallic</b> <b>mordants</b> is a promising approach to get the desired dyeing performance alongside opening up an avenue for eco-friendly dyeing.|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: Traditionally the dyeing {{of natural}} dyes from plant {{materials}} {{was done by}} boiling using roaches method which requires longer time, higher temperature and <b>metallic</b> <b>mordant</b> to get good color fastness.

Thus this study explored a suitable technique for more efficient natural dyeing using suitable bio mordant to improve the color fastness of natural dyes on silk fabric. Approach: This study demonstrated ultrasonic cleaner as a technique of dyeing the colorant from a selected plant, i. e Xylocarpus moluccensis to a selected fabric, i. e silk. Colorant from combination of heartwood and bark (as a biomordant) of Xylocarpus moluccensis was dyed at different ultrasonic volume and time.

30|$|Natural plant dyes and dyeing {{processes}} {{have the}} potential to impact the triple bottom line of niche markets in both positive and negative ways. The triple bottom line is a framework to measure environmental, social, and economic impacts on sustainability (Elkington 1998). Sustainability is defined as ‘the principle ensuring that our actions today do not limit the range of economic, social, and environmental options open to future generations’ (Elkington 1998, p. 20). Sustainably managed harvesting of dyestuffs provide a renewable, carbon reducing , biodegradable alternative agriculture product that employ local and rural communities (Saxena and Raja 2014). When not sustainably managed, communities can be economically exploited and natural environments devastated. Socially responsible dyeing practices maintain local and indigenous dye traditions, support the local economy, and create educational opportunities (Bebali Foundation 2013; Fletcher et al. 2012; Lopes Ferreira 2011). Beyond fiber dyeing, natural dyestuffs have market potential in the food, beverage, and cosmetic industries (Saxena and Raja 2014; Shahid and Mohammad 2013). Residual biomass on a small scale can be composted but can be a challenge for larger scale production (Saxena and Raja 2014). In addition, there is concern over the <b>metallic</b> <b>mordant</b> agent remaining in the effluent water as well as amounts of water and energy needed for the mordant and dye processes (Fletcher et al. 2012; Ismal et al. 2014).|$|E
30|$|The higher dyewood {{concentrations}} {{required of}} nonmordanted yarn to achieve comparable depth of shade as the PAS mordanted yarn {{indicate that a}} PAS mordant treatment enhanced dye adhesion thus requiring much less dyewood for black walnut and eastern redcedar. Even though Osage orange had comparatively less difference between PAS mordant and no mordant, 10  % is still considerable for natural dyes that will quantify quickly when dyeing large amounts. This finding impacts the environmental bottom line as trees are a natural resource that are slow to replenish. In addition, using less sawmill waste means less biomass remaining after dye extraction that needs disposal or combustion. While not as problematic to the craft dyer who can {{add it to the}} compost pile or garden, it may impact large scale dyers. However, these larger scale dyers could yet again find a use for the sawmill waste and have it made into paper products, particle board, or mulch. Socially, there are concerns over the use of manufactured metallic mordants which may impact health if proper ventilation, protection, and disposal is not practiced. Conversely, the use of less dyestuff with aid of a <b>metallic</b> <b>mordant</b> would help maintain local biodiversity and perhaps cultural heritage as there would be less need to cut down vegetation for dyeing. The need for less dyewood with use of a PAS mordant increases the already economic efficient use of sawmill waste and invasive tree species as dyestuffs. The use of a mordant would add its cost along with the addition of the mordant treatment step which uses water and thermal energy.|$|E
40|$|Natural dyes {{are known}} for their use in {{coloring}} of food substrate, leather as well as natural protein fibers like wool, silk and cotton as major areas of application since pre-historic times.

Shades on wool of red tones with good to excellent color fastness properties were obtained. Pre-mordanting with A. catechu improved the overall color and fastness parameters, due to the maximum dye uptake. Auxochromic groups responsible for interaction of dye and wool were studied by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis of R. cordifolia extract. The surface morphology of dyed wool fiber was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for any changes on fiber after dyeing.|$|R
30|$|In this study, wool fibers are dyed with {{a natural}} {{colorant}} extracted from walnut bark in presence and absence of mordants.

The results showed that pretreatment with <b>metallic</b> <b>mordants</b> substantially improved the colorimetric and fastness properties of wool fibers dyed with walnut bark extract. Ferrous sulfate and stannous chloride mordanted wool fibers shows best results than potassium aluminum sulfate mordanted and unmordanted wool fibers.

In this paper, leaf, bark, and fruit covering of the walnut tree were used to extract dye for obtaining a color palette on natural protein fibers. Wool and silk fabrics were pre-mordanted by four metallic mordants i. e. alum, tannic acid, copper sulphate, ferrous sulphate and three natural mordants i. e. tea, coffee and pomegranate, at three different pHconditions (self, acidic and alkaline) for development of a color palette. Dyed samples were tested for color yield using spectrophotometer to measure the K/S and CIE l*a*b* values, and wash, light, and rub fastness properties were also tested using standard test methods. Utilizing {{the results of the}} experimentation, a product line of fashion accessories i. e. three bags and three stoles was envisaged and to add value to these products, different techniques of tie and dye were employed. These products were divided into three categories as: silk, wool and combination of silk and wool. The color obtained from fruit was on the red-yellow quadrant of the color system while that of bark and leaf in the green-yellow. Overall it was observed that leaf and bark shades were very similar but the fruit gave a different color palette. It was also seen that the shades obtained with a <b>metallic</b> <b>mordant</b> like alum or tannic acid were more or less similar to that of pomegranate, tea, or coffee and thus these natural mordants could be used to replace the metallic mordants. In general wash, rub, and light fastness ranged from moderate to excellent. Tie and dye technique of knotting and lehariya (diagonal line patterns) were used for the products. Different color schemes were tried in single and double colors with simultaneous dyeing for the product line.

Although <b>metallic</b> <b>mordants</b> are used to enhance the affinity of natural dyes to textile fibers, they generate wastewater containing residual toxic metal ions which leave negative impacts on the environment and, cause severe health-related problems and allergic responses [96, 97].

30|$|In {{the case}} of <b>metallic</b> <b>mordants,</b> ferrous sulfate mordanted samples dyed with the mango leaf {{extracts}} showed excellent light fastness. This happened due {{to the formation of}} a complex with transition metal which protected the chromophore from photolytic degradation. The photons sorbed by the chromophoric group dissipated their energy by resonating within the six-member ring thus formed and, hence, protecting the dyes. Thus, ferrous sulfate can bind with more dye molecules than alum or tin. During exposure to light, the fabrics mordanted with ferrous sulfate, alum, or tin may have the same number of dye molecules destroyed. But as the fabrics mordanted with ferrous sulfate had deeper shades due to bonding with more number of dye molecules, it seemed to fade less compared to the fabric mordanted with alum or tin.|$|R
30|$|The {{orders of}} value {{difference}} (∆L*) {{of the samples}} were found as C>D>E>B.

Lower lightness value was observed for iron mordanted samples as it has coordination number 6, i.e. stronger capability of dye-mordant-fiber interactions than that of copper, tin and alum respectively. The color saturation (C*) and lightness (L*) have followed opposing fashion.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to appraise the fastness properties of some natural dyes of plant origin on cotton fabric. Owing to the growing trend of going "green" throughout the world, a renewed international interest has developed in the dyeing of textiles with natural colourants. These dyes exhibit better biodegradability and are usually well compatible with the environment. They contain natural colouring matter which is generally non-allergic, non-toxic, non-carcinogenic and non-hazardous to the user and environment. Common drawbacks of natural dyes are their non-uniform shades and poor to moderate colourfastness. In this research project, solvent extracted dyes from alkanet (Alkana tinctoria), cutch (Acacia catechu), madder (Rubia tinctorum) and ready to use dyes from marigold flower (Tegetes erecta L) and Turkey red (Rubia cordifolia) have been applied on cotton fabric through pad-steam dyeing procedure. To evaluate the possibility of increasing their colour fastness, various dyeing auxiliaries (mordants, UV absorbers, cationizing agents, crosslinkers, etc.) have been applied by pre-treatment and post-treatment techniques. <b>Metallic</b> <b>mordants</b> included aluminium sulphate, copper sulphate, ferric chloride, potassium dichromate and hydrated potassium aluminium sulphate or alum. Better fastness (wash, light, crocking), colour coordinates (lightness, chroma, hue and colour strength) as well as improvement in tensile strength was achieved with postmordanting of copper sulphate on most of these dyes. Pre-mordanting of potassium dichromate brutally damaged the tensile strength of the alkanet dyed sample. Cationization of cotton with quaternary ammonium compound (Albafix WFF) has improved the fastness properties, tensile strength as well as relative colour strength (K/S) of cotton dyed with alkanet, cutch and marigold flower dyes. Post-padding of reactive UV absorber based on oxalanilide (UV-SUN) and UV absorber Rayosan C (heterocyclic compound) greatly increased the light fastness of cotton fabric, dyed with these dyes. Similarly, post-treatment of soft polyurethane emulsion (Dicrylan) has enhanced the light and wash fastness as well as retained the tensile strength of natural dyed cotton. The use of crosslinkers could not bring further enhancement in the K/S value of cotton dyed with alkanet and generally, they yielded lighter shade. Cutch root extract yielded variety of beautiful brown shades with different mordants. It made an excellent demonstration of the colour fastness and tensile strength of cotton. Improved fastness properties and tensile strength have resulted from the postpadding of crosslinkers i. e., Knittex (modified dihydroxyethylene urea) and Fixapret F ECO (modified dimethyloldihydroxyethylene urea) on cutch dyed cotton. Pre-treatments of most of the <b>metallic</b> <b>mordants</b> have decreased the tensile strength of Turkey red dyed cotton to a great extent. Madder was the least successful dye in terms of fastness and tensile properties. The post-padding of crosslinkers glyoxalmonourein (Fixapret CPF) on marigold flower dyed sample imparted good fastness properties in addition to improving the tensile strength of the fabric. However, the shade of sample was lighter (pale yellow) than the other dye formulations. Among the two types of treatments, post padding proved significantly better in most of the dyeing recipes...|$|R
