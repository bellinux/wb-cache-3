50|$|The body of Anteaeolidiella lurana is {{translucent}} white. The {{front of}} the head has a bracket-shaped orange <b>mark</b> <b>extending</b> from the rhinophores {{to the base of}} the oral tentacles. There are a pair of faint orange lines on the sides of the head. Behind the rhinophores there is a diamond-shaped opaque white area, surrounded by orange pigment. A second orange diamond filled with white pigment outlines the pericardium. Two thin orange bands extend almost to the tail, forming teardrops or diamond marks every time they join. The rhinophores and the oral tentacles have the same colour as the background. The smooth rhinophores have orange pigment over the proximal two-thirds and white pigmentation on their tips. The conical oral tentacles have white pigmentation on their tips and may also have orange pigment over their dorsal surface. A pair of black eyes is visible at the base of the rhinophores. The ceratal epithelium is diffusely covered with orange pigment, interrupted by a white subapical band. The digestive gland inside the cerata is orange and terminates in a white cnidosac. The cerata are arranged in up to 23 rows and each row contains between two and nine cerata.|$|E

50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 14-20 mm for males and 20-24 mm for females. The forewings are pale yellow, faintly reddish along the outer and inner margins and lightest along the costal margin. There is an elongate oblique dark fuscous discal mark and smoky suffusion below the discal mark and {{to the middle of}} the outer margin. Below this, a crescent-shaped <b>mark</b> <b>extends</b> to the inner margin. The hindwings are yellow-orange. Adults are on wing year-round.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 19-21 mm. The forewings are brown sparsely irrorate {{pale yellow}} and {{the base of}} the costa and two triangular spots, one at the basal third, the second at two thirds of costa, yellow. The apex from the coastal four fifths to vein 4, yellow. Around the apex to vein 5, is a slender, broken, brown line. The costa is brown mixed with scarlet, where the ground color intrudes between the yellow costal markings. These markings are edged scarlet from the yellow costal mark at the basal third and a zigzag scarlet <b>mark</b> <b>extends</b> {{to the middle of the}} wing. On the dorsum, an inwardly curved scarlet <b>mark</b> <b>extends</b> from the basal fifth to near the middle and beyond the end of the cell is a large oval scarlet blotch, with a conspicuous, transverse, narrow series of black scales, extending to the tornus. At the basal third, in the cell, is a conspicuous fuscous-edged white spot and at the end of the cell is a very small, ill-defined whitish spot. The hindwings are yellowish white, basally shading to greyish then pink toward the termen. The costa and apex are grey.|$|R
