25|$|At {{the first}} Estonian Song Festival, in 1869, an {{important}} rallying {{event of the}} Estonian clans, two poems were set to music with lyrics by Lydia Koidula: Sind Surmani (Till Death) and Mu isamaa on minu arm (My Country is My Love), which became the unofficial anthem during the Soviet occupation when her father's Mu isamaa, mu õnn ja rõõm (My Country is <b>My</b> <b>Pride</b> and Joy), the anthem of the Estonian Republic between 1921 and 1940, was forbidden. Koidula's song always finished every festival, with or without permission. The tradition persists to this day.|$|E
500|$|Of {{this range}} Rimsky-Korsakov wrote in 1902, [...] "In every new work of mine I {{am trying to}} do {{something}} that is new for me. On the one hand, I am pushed on by the thought that in this way, [...] will retain freshness and interest, {{but at the same time}} I am prompted by <b>my</b> <b>pride</b> to think that many facets, devices, moods and styles, if not all, should be within my reach." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{conductor}} Felix Weingartner {{found that}} [...] "The Flowermaidens' costumes showed extraordinary lack of taste, but the singing was incomparable... When the curtain had been rung {{down on the}} final scene and we were walking down the hill, I seemed to hear the words of Goethe 'and you can say you were present.' The 'Parsifal' performances of 1882 were artistic events of supreme interest and it is <b>my</b> <b>pride</b> and joy that I participated in them." ...|$|E

500|$|My mind {{rejects the}} whole present social order and Christianity—home, the {{recognised}} virtues, classes {{of life and}} religious doctrines. [...] Six years ago I left the Catholic church, hating it most fervently. I found it {{impossible for me to}} remain in it on account of the impulses of my nature. I made secret war upon it when I was a student and declined to accept the positions it offered me. By doing this I made myself a beggar but I retained <b>my</b> <b>pride.</b> Now I make open war upon it by what I write and say and do.|$|E
500|$|In a 1900 {{publication}} the farm's motto {{was reported}} to be [...] "The production of pure food of the highest standard of excellence", although a 1902 publication reported that its motto was [...] "Do unto a cow as you would that a cow would do unto you" [...] (also saying that the motto appeared in large letters in every barn on the farm). Notices printed by the farm began with the verse, [...] "If a Cobbler by trade, I'll make it <b>my</b> <b>pride,</b> the best of all Cobblers to be; and if only a Tinker, no Tinker on earth shall mend an old Kettle like me"; this verse and several other mottoes decorated friezes on the interior walls of the Dalmeny boarding house.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{begins the}} first verse {{of the song}} in a near-whisper, [...] "I thought that things like this get better with time / But I still need you / Why is that?" [...] The latter rhetorical {{question}} reappears throughout the song. In the chorus lines, she questions herself, [...] "I miss you / But if I got with you, could it feel the same?" [...] From the second verse and onwards, the song finds Beyoncé [...] "vocalizing an internal battle, alternately desperate and calm", as stated by Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle. She starts to sing in a double voice; her lower vocal notes are set as the song's base, while her voice in a heightened key is played over it. In the second verse, she sings, [...] "The words don’t ever seem to come out right / But I still mean em", pining for her ex-love interest and feeling self-conscious for doing so, [...] "It hurts <b>my</b> <b>pride</b> {{to tell you how}} I feel, but I still need to" [...] before asking again, [...] "Why is that?". The bridge features Beyoncé chanting, [...] "No matter who you are / It is so simple / A feeling / But it’s everything." ...|$|E

500|$|Khan married Hameedah Begum (the eldest {{daughter}} of Allama Mashriqi) in 1940. Together, {{they had three}} daughters (Mariam, Amina, and Rasheeda) and a son (Akbar). After Hameedah Begum's death in 1966, he married Shafiq Khan and had one daughter, Ayesha. During his ICS career, Khan worked as collector of revenue, a position that brought him into regular contact with living conditions in rural areas of East Bengal. The Bengal famine of 1943 and subsequent inadequate handling of the situation by the colonial rulers led him to resign from the Indian Civil Service in 1945. He wrote, [...] "I realised that if I did not escape while I was young and vigorous, I will forever remain in the trap, and terminate as a bureaucratic big wig." [...] During this period, he {{was influenced by the}} philosophy of Nietzsche and Mashriqi, and joined the Khaksar Movement. This attachment was brief. He quit the movement and turned to Sufism. According to Khan, [...] "I had a profound personal concern; I wanted to live a life free from fear and anxiety, a calm and serene life, without turmoil and conflict.when I followed the advice of old Sufis and sages, and tried to curb my greed, <b>my</b> <b>pride</b> and aggression, fears, anxieties and conflict diminished." ...|$|E
500|$|Stone gave Charlie Sheen {{the choice}} of Jack Lemmon or Martin Sheen to play his father in the film, and Sheen picked his father. The elder Sheen related to the moral sense of his character. Stone cast Daryl Hannah as Bud Fox's materialistic girlfriend Darien Taylor, but {{felt that she was}} never happy with the role and did not know why she {{accepted}} it. He tried to explain the character to Hannah repeatedly, and thought that the materialism of the character conflicted with Hannah's idealism. Stone said later that he was aware early on that she was not right for the part. [...] "Daryl Hannah was not happy doing the role and I should have let her go. All my crew {{wanted to get rid of}} her after one day of shooting. <b>My</b> <b>pride</b> was such that I kept saying I was going to make it work". Stone also had difficulties with Sean Young, who made her opinions known that Hannah should be fired and that she should play that role instead. Young would show up to the set late and unprepared. She did not get along with Charlie Sheen, which caused further friction on the set. In retrospect, Stone felt that Young was right and he should have swapped Hannah's role with hers. Stone admits that he had [...] "some problems" [...] with Young, but was not willing to confirm or deny rumors that she walked off with all of her costumes when she completed filming.|$|E

Can one renounce what guarantees his rights?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{marriage}} {{was marred by}} difficulties that included financial problems, {{as well as her}} husband's alcoholism and infidelities. Gresham sometimes had drunken outbursts, once smashing his guitar on a chair. Davidman wrote that her husband had telephoned her, one day in spring 1946, telling her that he was having a nervous breakdown, and did not know when he would return home. Afterwards, she suffered from a defeated emotional state. She had an experience that she described as: [...] "for the first time <b>my</b> <b>pride</b> was forced to admit that I was not, after all, 'the master of my fate'... All my defenses – all the walls of arrogance and cocksureness and self-love behind which I had hid from God – went down momentarily – and God came in." [...] When Gresham did return home, the couple began to look to religion for answers. Davidman at first studied Judaism, but decided to study all religions and concluded that [...] "the Redeemer who had made himself known, whose personality I would have recognized among ten thousand—He was Jesus." [...] Through their religious studies, the couple, in particular, began to read and be influenced by the books of C.S. Lewis.|$|E
