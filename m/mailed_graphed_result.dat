40|$|The <b>graph</b> <b>resulting</b> from {{contracting}} edge "e" is denoted as G/e and the <b>graph</b> <b>resulting</b> from deleting edge "e" is denoted as G-e. An edge "e" is radius-essential if rad(G/e) rad(G), and radius-vital {{if it is}} both radius-essential and radius-increasing. We partition {{the edges}} that are not radius-vital into three categories. In this paper, we study realizability questions relating {{to the number of}} edges that are not radius-vital in the three defined categories. A graph is radius-vital if all its edges are radius-vital. We give a structural characterization of radius-vital graphs...|$|R

40|$|A graph G {{is called}} perfect if the {{chromatic}} {{number and the}} clique number have the same value for every of its induced subgraph.

40|$|A vertex set S of a graph G is convex if all {{vertices}} {{of every}} shortest path {{between two of}} its vertices are in S. We say that G has a convex p-cover if  can be covered by p convex sets. The convex cover number of G is the least  for which G has a convex p- cover. In particular, the nontrivial convex cover number of G is the least  for which G has a convex p- cover, where every set contains at least 3 elements. In this paper we determine convex cover number and nontrivial convex cover number of special <b>graphs</b> <b>resulting</b> from some operations. We examine <b>graphs</b> <b>resulting</b> from join of graphs, cartesian product of graphs, lexicographic product of graphs and corona of graphs. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{prove that}} any simple and cosimple {{connected}} binary matroid {{has at least}} four connected hyperplanes. We further prove that each element in such a matroid is contained {{in at least two}} connected hyperplanes. Our main result generalizes a matroid result of Kelmans, and independently, of Seymour. The following consequence of the main <b>result</b> generalizes a <b>graph</b> <b>result</b> of Thomassen and Toft on induced non-separating cycles and another <b>graph</b> <b>result</b> of Kaugars on deletable vertices. If G is a simple 2 -connected graph with minimum degree at least 3, then, for every edge e, {{there are at least two}} induced non-separating cycles avoiding e and two deletable vertices non-incident to e. Moreover, G has at least four induced non-separating cycles...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to lower bound the {{connectivity}} of k-path graphs. From the bounds obtained, we give conditions to guarantee maximum connectivity. Then, it is shown that those maximally connected graphs satisfying the previous conditions are also super-lambda. While doing so, we derive some properties about the girth and the diameter of path <b>graphs.</b> Finally, the <b>results</b> are extended to path <b>graphs</b> <b>resulting</b> from the iteration of the k-path graph operator...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a conservative approximation algorithm that derives close to minimal buffer capacities for an application {{described as a}} cyclo-static dataflow <b>graph.</b> The <b>resulting</b> buffer capacities satisfy constraints on the maximum buffer capacities and end-to-end throughput and latency constraints.

We show that modelling an MP 3 playback application as a cyclo-static dataflow graph instead of a multi-rate dataflow <b>graph</b> <b>results</b> in buffer capacities that are reduced up to 39 %. Furthermore, the algorithm is applied to a real-life car-radio application, in which two independent streams are processed...|$|R
