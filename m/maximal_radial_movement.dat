40|$|During recent years, the <b>radial</b> <b>movement</b> of the {{arterial}} wall {{has been extensively}} studied, and measurements of the <b>radial</b> <b>movement</b> are now an important tool in cardiovascular research for characterizing the mechanical properties of the {{arterial wall}}. In contrast, the longitudinal movement of vessels has gained little or no attention {{as it has been}} presumed that this movement is negligible. With modern high-resolution ultrasound, it can, however, be seen that the intima-media complex of the arterial wall moves not only in the radial direction, but also in the longitudinal direction during pulse-wave propagation. This paper describes a new non-invasive ultrasonic method that is able to measure simultaneously two dimensionally arterial vessel wall movements. The method is demonstrated in a limited in vivo trial. Results from the in vivo trial show that, apart from the well-known <b>radial</b> <b>movement,</b> there is a distinct longitudinal movement in the human common carotid artery with, in this case, the intima-media complex moving substantially as compared with the region of the tunica adventitia. Two-dimensional evaluation of the vessel-wall movements, taking not only the <b>radial</b> <b>movement,</b> but also the longitudinal movement into account, may provide novel information of importance in the evaluation of vessel-wall function...|$|R
30|$|Two activable tracers, Rb and Eu, were {{injected}} into the sapwood of Japanese cedars (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) to investigate the <b>radial</b> <b>movement</b> of minerals in their stems in the resting period. Eight trees of four cultivars, two of which genetically form wet heartwood, were treated {{near the end of}} the growing period. At 40 days after the treatment, Rb was detected in the outer heartwood, whereas Eu was not. <b>Radial</b> <b>movement</b> of Rb was more rapid in trees with wet heartwood than in those with normal heartwood. At 204 days after the treatment, more Rb was detected in the heartwood than was found on the first sampling, whereas no Eu was detected in the heartwood. The difference in <b>radial</b> <b>movement</b> between Rb and Eu was considered mainly to be the result of selective transport of beneficial minerals by Japanese cedar. The difference in the rate of <b>radial</b> <b>movement</b> of Rb between wet and normal heartwood became more conspicuous at 204 days after treatment. We concluded that the movement of Rb from the sapwood to the outer heartwood was by active transport through the rays, whereas that in the heartwood was by diffusion due to the gradient of Rb concentration.|$|R
40|$|We have {{recently}} {{reported that the}} inner layers of the arteries, the intima-media complex, of common carotid artery, move {{as much in the}} longitudinal direction as in the radial direction, during the cardiac cycle. In order to study this phenomenon we have developed a high-resolution ultrasonic method that can simultaneously record both the longitudinal and the <b>radial</b> <b>movements</b> of the arterial wall non-invasively in vivo. However, in young individuals with large movements and with thin intima-media complex it happens sometimes that the echoes from the adventitia region interfere. To be able to minimise the size of the region-of-interest in the radial direction, we suggest that the <b>radial</b> <b>movement</b> of the arterial vessel is first measured and that the <b>radial</b> <b>movement</b> is used as a priori information when the longitudinal movement is measured.

30|$|Rubidium {{solution}} was injected in the sapwood of a Japanese cedar cultivar {{in the growing}} period, and its <b>radial</b> <b>movement</b> in stem was traced to investigate the accumulation of alkali metals in the heartwood. Sapwood-injected Rb was detected in outer heartwood at 10  days after the treatment, and continued increasing at 20  days after. <b>Radial</b> <b>movement</b> of Rb toward heartwood was considered to occur soon after the treatment, and to decline {{at a certain point}} of the time after Rb injection ceased. However, Rb continued moving in heartwood probably by diffusion even after the cease of Rb injection. In a series of injection experiment, <b>radial</b> <b>movement</b> of injected Rb is not corresponding to the seasonality of both cambial activity and cytological changes of ray parenchyma accompanied with heartwood formation. From the results on Rb’s behavior, we conclude that accumulation of K and other alkali metals in heartwood of Japanese cedar has two steps, active transport from sapwood to outer heartwood via ray, and diffusion in heartwood, and that these processes proceed independently from both cambial activity and cytological changes of ray parenchyma.|$|R

Our numerical study {{is based on a}} four field full-F gyrofluid model, which entails the consistent description of high fluctuation amplitudes and dynamic finite Larmor radius effects. We find that the <b>maximal</b> <b>radial</b> blob velocity increases with the square root of the initial pressure perturbation and that a finite Larmor radius contributes to highly compact blob structures that propagate in the poloidal direction. An extensive parameter study reveals that a smooth transition to this compact blob regime occurs when the finite Larmor radius effect strength, defined by the ratio of the magnetic field aligned component of the ion diamagnetic to the E⃗×B⃗ vorticity, exceeds unity. The <b>maximal</b> <b>radial</b> blob velocities agree excellently with the inertial velocity scaling law over more than an order of magnitude. We show that the finite Larmor radius effect strength affects the poloidal and total particle transport and present an empirical scaling law for the poloidal and total blob velocities.

40|$|Abstract. The user {{interface}} for text messaging via SMS has changed little since {{the technology was}} introduced on cell phones. Authoring text with a phone keypad is tedious and error-prone. Furthermore, the cell phone intrudes into other activities while hands hold it for authoring. In this paper we suggest a future alternative {{user interface}} for SMS messages based on a round wristwatch device. Two button-wheels are used to access a round hi-res color display. Text input is done with a round soft keyboard that maps intuitively to the buttonwheels using the angular and <b>radial</b> <b>movements</b> of polar coordinates. Furthermore, a wristwatch device has an aesthetics that is less intrusive than a cell phone. Since the device is always deployed, authoring is easily interrupted to use the hands for other tasks. Informal user evaluation of a prototype implementation suggests that this novel round design provides an improved user experience for authoring SMS compared to cell phones.

Many researches tend to focus on the formulation of sex estimation standards using measurements taken from long bones of the appendicular skeleton, rather than the traditionally favored skeletal remains namely; pelvis and cranium.

Objective: To formulate a model for stature construction and sex prediction the <b>Maximal</b> <b>Radial</b> and ulnar lengths in adult Egyptians. Materials and methods: Maximal lengths of the radius and ulna bones, taken from adult Egyptian cadavers presented to Forensic medicine mortuary for pathological or medico-legal reasons during the period from the start of January 2014 till the end of December 2014 were recorded, studied and statistically analyzed.

In this paper, a novel stochastic method called modified <b>radial</b> <b>movement</b> optimization (MRMO), is developed for estimating fuel cost coefficients of thermal generating units. <b>Radial</b> <b>movement</b> optimization is a novel global optimization technique used to solve the complex optimization problems. In this work, four case studies are considered for implementing the RMO technique in fuel cost parameter estimation problems.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{previously}} demonstrated that an axially loaded weightless circular rod buckles helically when constrained within a circular cylinder. The effects of pinned and fixed end conditions {{on the behavior of}} such a helically buckled rod are investigated. Both end conditions locate the rod end on the cylinder axis. The pinned end condition considers the rod end free to rotate about all three axes, allows axial translation, and prevents <b>radial</b> <b>movement.</b> The fixed end condition allows axial rotation and translation, requires the rod end to be tangent to the cylinder axis, and prevents <b>radial</b> <b>movement.</b> Both end conditions are found to perturb the helix in an exponentially decaying manner for a distance of less than one pitch length. Far from the end, the rod behaves as an undisturbed constant-pitch helix. The distance from the rod end to the point of initial contact with the cylinder wall is calculated. Closed form analytical solutions are obtained for the deflected shapes and internal reactions of the end sections. The maximum internal bending moment for the pinned-end case is 19. 5 % higher in the end section than in the helical section. The maximum bending moment for the fixed-end case also occurs in the end section and is 1 % higher than in the helical section. The solution procedure applies to rods of either finite or infinite length. Experimental results confirm the analytical findings...|$|R
40|$|In four {{experiments}} involving blindfolded subjects, constant {{errors in}} the haptic judgment of extent in the horizontal plane were found to relate consistently to the time and velocity of limb <b>movement.</b> <b>Radial</b> <b>movements,</b> executed at a slower speed and for a longer time, are judged longer than tangential movements of equal extent. The data {{were considered in relation}} to certain physiological and kinematic properties of the actively moving limb. Taken together with additional information on judgments of movement duration, the results suggest that the illusion of extent is modulated by the perception of differential time cues. In these terms, it was noted that the haptic horizontal-vertical illusion with the L figure is another instance of the interaction of apparent space and time commonly found in studies of psychological relativity. Following Reid's (1954) documentation of the haptic horizontal-vertical illusion with an L figure, recent {{studies have shown that the}} effect is functionally related to the components of radial and tangential exploratory arm movements as described earlier by Davidon and Cheng (1964). Specifically, <b>radial</b> arm <b>movements</b> toward and away from the body, whether along the sagittal or coronal planes, are judged longer than equal tangential movements along the front or side of the body. The effect operates regardless of the spatial separation of the two extents to be judged (Cheng, 1968) and independently of two different types of movement involving different joints and muscle groups (Day & Wong, 1971). As <b>radial</b> <b>movements</b> are specific to the horizontal plane, no relative overestimation of haptic extent is found when the L figure is presented in the vertical (fronto-parallel) Experiments 1, 2, and 3 were completed at the University of Waikato in Hamilton, New Zealand, and supported by New Zealand University Grant...|$|R
