5|$|The {{first volume}} of Beebe's {{pheasant}} <b>monograph</b> was published that fall, although the ongoing war made it unclear when the remaining three volumes would be published. The first volume was highly praised by reviewers, and received the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1918. In January 1919 Roosevelt, who was severely ill by this point, wrote to Beebe from his hospital bed congratulating Beebe on {{the publication of his}} <b>monograph.</b> His letter of congratulation to Beebe was the last letter that Roosevelt wrote before his death. Volume II of the <b>monograph</b> was published in 1921, and volumes III and IV were published in 1922. The completed work, titled A <b>Monograph</b> of the Pheasants, has been considered by some reviewers to be possibly the greatest ornithological <b>monograph</b> of the twentieth century.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To test three related {{hypotheses}} about <b>monographs</b> circulation at academic health sciences libraries: (1) Juran's "Vital Few" Principle, sometimes incorrectly {{referred to as}} the "Pareto Principle"; (2) most (> 30 %) new <b>monographs</b> will not circulate within four years; and, (3) Trueswell's 20 / 80 rule concerning intensity of <b>monographs</b> circulation. METHODS: Retrospective circulation study conducted at a major academic health sciences library in November 1997 on <b>monographs</b> acquired during 1993, utilizing an online review file. RESULTS: Unexpectedly, most <b>monographs</b> (84 %) had circulated at least once in the four years following acquisition. Combining circulation and in-house data revealed that 90. 7 % of the <b>monographs</b> acquired in 1993 had been used at least once. Small percentages of these <b>monographs</b> produced disproportionately high circulation levels. CONCLUSION: <b>Monographs</b> circulation rates confirm Juran's Vital Few principle. Most <b>monographs</b> circulated at least once in contrast to results reported by the Pittsburgh Study or other studies reported by Hardesty and Fenske. The results do not comply with Trueswell's 20 / 80 ratio rule. Further research needs to investigate the effects of low students to books ratios and problem-based learning (PBL) curricula upon <b>monographs</b> utilization...|$|R

During the course of writing this book, Beebe was reminded of many experiences during the pheasant expedition which he had not included in his original <b>monograph,</b> and wrote an additional book titled Pheasant Jungles about his adventures during this expedition. While A <b>Monograph</b> of the Pheasants had been a factual account of this expedition, Pheasant Jungles was a somewhat fictionalized account, in which Beebe altered some aspects of his experience in order {{to appeal to a}} wider audience.|$|E

The government intended to publish an article based on Brumund's study supplemented by Wilsen's drawings, but Brumund refused to cooperate. The government then commissioned another scholar, C. Leemans, who compiled a <b>monograph</b> based on Brumund's and Wilsen's sources. In 1873, the first <b>monograph</b> of the detailed study of Borobudur was published, followed by its French translation a year later. The first photograph of the monument was taken in 1872 by a Dutch-Flemish engraver, Isidore van Kinsbergen.|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that collaboration is advantageous in science, for example with collaboratively written articles tending to attract more citations than solo articles, and strong arguments that interdisciplinary collaboration can be particularly powerful. Nevertheless, {{it is not known}} whether {{the same is true for}} research that produces books. This article tests whether co-authored scholarly <b>monographs</b> attract more citations than solo <b>monographs</b> using books published before 2011 from 30 categories in the Web of Science. The results show that solo <b>monographs</b> numerically dominate collaborative <b>monographs,</b> but give no evidence of a citation advantage for collaboration on <b>monographs.</b> In contrast, for nearly all these subjects (28 out of 30) there was a citation advantage for collaboratively produced journal articles.
