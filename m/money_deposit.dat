50|$|Although {{money is}} the most common consideration, it is not a {{required}} element to have a valid real estate contract.

The amount, {{a small fraction of the}} total price, is listed in the contract, with the remainder of the cost to be paid at the closing. In some rare cases, other instruments of value, like notes and/or stock or other negotiable instruments can be used for consideration. Other hard assets, like gold, silver and anything of value can also be used or in other cases, love (where it can be shown to have existed between the parties). However, the earnest <b>money</b> <b>deposit</b> represents a credit towards the final sales price, which is usually the main or only consideration.|$|E

The account party also benefits from the low cost of demand guarantees compared to other instruments such as accessory guarantees.|$|R
