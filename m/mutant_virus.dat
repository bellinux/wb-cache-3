We constructed new <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> expressing truncated T Ag proteins and found that these <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> exhibited the host range phenotype. The host range phenotype was independent of acetylation of T Ag at lysine 697. Co-expression of the C terminal domain of T Ag (aa 627 – 708) in trans increased both T Ag and VP 1 mRNA as well as protein levels for host range <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> in the restrictive cell type. In addition, the T Ag 627 – 708 fragment promoted the productive lytic infection of host range <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> in the nonpermissive cell type.

40|$|When {{expressed}} in vitro, the neuraminidase (NA) of A/WSN/ 33 (WSN) virus binds and sequesters plasminogen {{on the cell}} surface, leading to enhanced cleavage of the viral hemagglutinin. To obtain direct evidence that the plasminogen-binding activity of the NA enhances the pathogenicity of WSN <b>virus,</b> we generated <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> whose NAs lacked plasminogen-binding activity because of a mutation at the C terminus, from Lys to Arg or Leu. In the presence of trypsin, these <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> replicated similarly to wild-type virus in cell culture. By contrast, {{in the presence of}} plasminogen, the <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> failed to undergo multiple cycles of replication while the wild-type virus grew normally. The <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> showed attenuated growth in mice and failed to grow at all in the brain. Furthermore, another <b>mutant</b> WSN <b>virus,</b> possessing an NA with a glycosylation site at position 130 (146 in N 2 numbering), leading to the loss of neurovirulence, failed to grow in cell culture in the presence of plasminogen. We conclude that the plasminogen-binding activity of the WSN NA determines its pathogenicity in mice...|$|R

40|$|Newcastle disease virus (NDV) edits its P gene by {{inserting}} {{one or two}} G residues at the conserved editing site (UUUUUCCC, genome sense) and transcribes the P mRNA (unedited), the V mRNA (with a + 1 frameshift), and the W mRNA (with a + 2 frameshift).

Little {{is known about the}} role of the V and W proteins in NDV replication and pathogenesis. We have constructed and recovered two recombinant viruses in which the expression of the V or both the V and W proteins has been abolished. Compared to the parental <b>virus,</b> the <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> showed impaired growth in cell cultures, except in Vero cells. However, transient expression of the carboxyl-terminal portion of the V protein enhanced the growth of the <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses.</b> In embryonated chicken eggs, the parental virus grew to high titers in embryos of different gestational ages, whereas the <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> showed an age-dependent phenomenon, growing to lower titer in more-developed embryos. An interferon (IFN) sensitivity assay showed that the parental virus was more resistant to the antiviral effect of IFN than the <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses.</b> Moreover, infection with the parental virus resulted in STAT 1 protein degradation, but not with the <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses.</b> These findings indicate that the V protein of NDV possesses the ability to inhibit alpha IFN and that the IFN inhibitory function lies in the carboxyl-terminal domain. Pathogenicity studies showed that the V protein of NDV significantly contributes to the virus virulence...|$|R

P. Nayak, J. Gen. Virol. 84 : 3105 - 3113, 2003). In this report, however, we demonstrate that the CCHH motif plays a critical role in virulence in mice and that some CCHH mutants are highly attenuated in BALB/c mice. Some of the <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> replicated the least in mice lungs, induced little or no lung lesions, and caused highly reduced morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, growth patterns of <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> in different cell lines (MDCK, MLE 12, 3 LL, A 549, and 293 T) varied. <b>Mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> that were attenuated in mice also grew poorly in mouse and human cells in culture. However, wild-type (WT) and all <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> replicated to the same titer in MDCK (canine) cells or embryonated chicken eggs. Attenuation in mice correlated with reduced growth in mouse cells in culture, suggesting that potential attenuation in a given host can be predicted from the growth characteristics of the virus in cultured cells (preferably lung cells) from the same species. In challenge experiments, mice immunized by infection with attenuated <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> were fully protected from lethal challenge with WT virus. In summary, the replication and attenuating properties of these mutants suggest that the CCHH motif provides a critical determinant for virulence in mouse and that mutations in the CCHH motif yield potential vaccine candidates for the development of live species-specific attenuated influenza virus vaccines...|$|R

Furthermore, E 1 B 19 K gene <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> are defective for cellular transformation. We report that these <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> possess a host-range phenotype for growth in human cells. In human HeLa cells the <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> grew to the same levels as the wild-type virus, but they were severely defective for growth in KB cells. In human WI 38 cells, the E 1 B 19 K gene <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> had a substantial growth advantage over the wild-type virus, yielding 500 -fold-higher titers. Viral DNA synthesis was reduced 10 - to 20 -fold in WI 38 cells infected with the wild-type virus relative to that synthesized by the E 1 B <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses.</b> Viral early and late protein synthesis was similarly reduced in wild type- relative to mutant-infected cells. These reduced levels of early gene expression in wild-type virus-infected cells were paralleled by comparably reduced levels of early cytoplasmic mRNA. The primary cause of this host-range phenotype appeared {{at the level of}} early gene transcription, since transcription of viral early genes in the mutant-infected cells was substantially greater than levels found in cells infected with the wild-type virus. These results implicate the E 1 B 19 K tumor antigen in the regulation of adenovirus early gene expression. Specifically, the E 1 B 19 K protein directly or indirectly exerts a negative effect on early gene transcription accounting for efficient gene expression from the E 1 B <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> in WI 38 cells. Based on these findings it is probable that the cyt and deg phenotypes observed in mutant-infected HeLa and KB cells are the result of the pleiotropic effect of this altered gene regulation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMurine gamma{{herpesvirus}}- 68 (MHV 68) is genetically {{related to}} human Epstein–Barr virus and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus {{and provides a}} tractable model to study gammaherpesvirus–host interactions in vivo and in vitro. The MHV 68 -encoded v-RCA product inhibits murine complement activation and shares sequence homology with other virus and host regulators of complement activation. Here we show that v-RCA is required for efficient MHV 68 replication in primary murine macrophages, but not in murine embryonic fibroblasts. v-RCA-deficient MHV 68 <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> display defects in viral DNA synthesis in infected macrophages. Importantly, attenuated growth of v-RCA <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> is not rescued in macrophages lacking critical components of the complement system including C 3, indicating that the macrophage-specific role of v-RCA in MHV 68 replication is complement-independent. This contrasts with the situation in vivo in which attenuated neurovirulence of v-RCA <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> is rescued in C 3 -deficient mice. This study shows a novel, complement independent cell-type-specific function of a gammaherpesvirus RCA protein...|$|R

Dengue virus type 4 (DEN 4) was previously grown in Vero cells {{in the presence of}} 5 -fluorouracil, and the characterization of 1248 mutagenized, Vero cell passaged clones identified 20 temperature-sensitive (ts) <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> that were attenuated (att) in suckling mouse brain (J. E. Blaney, Jr., D. H. Johnson, C. Y. Firestone, C. T. Hanson, B. R. Murphy, and S. S. Whitehead, 2001, J. Virol. 75 (20), 9731 – 9740). The present investigation has extended these studies by identifying an additional 22 DEN 4 <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> which have a small plaque size (sp) phenotype in Vero cells and/or the liver cell line, HuH- 7. Five <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> have a sp phenotype in both Vero and HuH- 7 cells, three of which are also ts. Seventeen <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> have a sp phenotype in only HuH- 7 cells, 13 of which are also ts. Each of the sp viruses was growth restricted in the suckling mouse brain, exhibiting a wide range of reduction in replication (9 - to 100, 000 -fold). Complete nucleotide sequence was determined for the 22 DEN 4 sp <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses,</b> and nucleotide substitutions were found in the 3 ′-untranslated region (UTR) as well as in all coding regions except NS 4 A. Identical mutations have been identified in multiple virus clones, suggesting that they may be involved in the adaptation of DEN 4 virus to efficient growth in Vero cells. Six of the 22 sp 5 -FU <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> lacked coding mutations in the structural genes, and 17 recombinant DEN 4 viruses were generated which separately encoded each of the mutations observed in these six sp viruses. Analysis of the recombinant DEN 4 viruses defined the genetic basis of the sp, ts, and att phenotypes observed in the six sp viruses. Mutations in NS 1, NS 3, and the 3 ′-UTR were found to confer a greater than 100 -fold, 10, 000 -fold, and 1000 -fold reduction in replication of rDEN 4 virus in SCID mice transplanted with HuH- 7 cells, respectively, which serves as a novel small animal model for DEN 4 infection...|$|R

It comes from Cobra Commander, who convinced Mindbender to free him, because he knew how to use a weapon. Cobra Commander convinced Serpentor to let him be his scapegoat since there would be no one to do the punishing for him.|$|E
40|$|The E 1 B 55 -kDa oncoprotein of {{adenovirus}} {{enables the}} virus to overcome restrictions imposed on viral replication by the cell cycle. Approximately 20 % of HeLa cells infected with an E 1 B 55 -kDa mutant adenovirus produced virus when evaluated by electron microscopy or by assays for infectious centers. By contrast, all HeLa cells infected with a wild-type adenovirus produced virus. The yield of E 1 B <b>mutant</b> <b>virus</b> from randomly cycling HeLa cells correlated with the fraction of cells in S phase {{at the time of}} infection. In synchronously growing HeLa cells, approximately 75 % of the cells infected during S phase with the E 1 B <b>mutant</b> <b>virus</b> produced virus, whereas only 10 % of the cells infected during G 1 produced virus. The yield of E 1 B <b>mutant</b> <b>virus</b> from HeLa cells infected during S phase was sevenfold greater than that of cells infected during G 1 and threefold greater than that of cells infected during asynchronous growth. Cells infected during S phase with the E 1 B <b>mutant</b> <b>virus</b> exhibited severe cytopathic effects, whereas cells infected with the E 1 B <b>mutant</b> <b>virus</b> during G 1 exhibited a mild cytopathic effect. Viral DNA synthesis appeared independent of the cell cycle because equivalent amounts of viral DNA were synthesized in cells infected with either wild-type or E 1 B <b>mutant</b> <b>virus.</b> The inability of the E 1 B <b>mutant</b> <b>virus</b> to replicate was not mediated by the status of p 53. These results define a novel property of the large tumor antigen of adenovirus in relieving growth restrictions imposed on viral replication by the cell cycle...|$|E

40|$|SER {{virus is}} a type 5 parainfluenza virus that does not exhibit {{syncytium}} formation, in contrast to most other paramyxoviruses.

In this study we used repeated passage to select for <b>mutant</b> SER <b>viruses,</b> which were found to be fusogenic. The <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> replicated at levels comparable to or higher than the wild-type SER virus and caused plaque formation, in contrast to the wild-type virus which does not form plaques.

The F genes of <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> were cloned and sequenced and shared some mutations, including a proline-to-leucine change at position 22 and an isoleucine-to-leucine substitution at position 191; other changes that were specific to each mutant were also found. The HN proteins of <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> also showed mutations spanning the length of the protein whereas the M protein showed a consistent mutation, threonine to isoleucine, at position 129.

40|$|AbstractWe have {{previously}} shown that an N-glycosylation site of N 306 of HIV- 1 gp 120 {{is not necessary}} for the HIV- 1 infectivity but protects HIV- 1 from neutralising antibodies. In contrast Nakayama et al. [FEBS Lett.

We therefore re-examined {{the ability of a}} <b>mutant</b> <b>virus,</b> lacking the N 306 glycan, to replicate in various types of cells and found no change in co-receptor usage for <b>mutant</b> <b>virus.</b> The ability of <b>mutant</b> <b>virus</b> to replicate or to induce syncytia in infected cells was similar to that of wild type virus.

40|$|An immunodominant antigen, p 35, is {{expressed}} {{on the envelope}} of intracellular mature virions (IMV) of vaccinia virus. p 35 is encoded by the viral late gene H 3 L, but {{its role in the}} virus life cycle is not known. This report demonstrates that soluble H 3 L protein binds to heparan sulfate on the cell surface and competes with the binding of vaccinia virus, indicating a role for H 3 L protein in IMV adsorption to mammalian cells. A <b>mutant</b> <b>virus</b> defective in expression of H 3 L (H 3 L−) was constructed; the <b>mutant</b> <b>virus</b> has a small plaque phenotype and 10 -fold lower IMV and extracellular enveloped virion titers than the wild-type virus. Virion morphogenesis is severely blocked and intermediate viral structures such as viral factories and crescents accumulate in cells infected with the H 3 L− <b>mutant</b> <b>virus.</b> IMV from the H 3 L− <b>mutant</b> <b>virus</b> are somewhat altered and less infectious than wild-type virions. However, cells infected by the <b>mutant</b> <b>virus</b> form multinucleated syncytia after low pH treatment, suggesting that H 3 L protein is not required for cell fusion. Mice inoculated intranasally with wild-type virus show high mortality and severe weight loss, whereas mice infected with H 3 L− <b>mutant</b> <b>virus</b> survive and recover faster, indicating that inactivation of the H 3 L gene attenuates virus virulence in vivo. In summary, these data indicate that H 3 L protein mediates vaccinia virus adsorption to cell surface heparan sulfate and is important for vaccinia virus infection in vitro and in vivo. In addition, H 3 L protein plays a role in virion assembly...|$|E
40|$|Bovine {{herpesvirus}} type 1 (BHV- 1) is {{an important}} pathogen that can initiate bovine respiratory disease complex. Like {{other members of the}} subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, BHV- 1 establishes latency in sensory neurons. The latency-related (LR) gene expresses a family of alternatively spliced transcripts in infected sensory neurons that have the potential to encode several LR proteins. An LR <b>mutant</b> <b>virus</b> that contains three stop codons near the 5 ’ terminus of the first open reading frame in the LR gene does not express two LR proteins or reactivate from latency. In addition, the LR <b>mutant</b> <b>virus</b> induces higher levels of apoptosis in trigeminal ganglionic neurons and grows less efficiently in certain tissues of infected calves. In spite of the reduced pathogenesis, the LR <b>mutant</b> <b>virus,</b> wild-type BHV- 1, and the LR rescued virus exhibit identical growth properties in cultured bovine cells. In this study, we demonstrated that during early phases of productive infection the LR <b>mutant</b> <b>virus</b> expressed higher levels of LR-RNA relative to the LR rescued virus or wt BHV- 1. Bovine kidney cells infected with the LR <b>mutant</b> <b>virus</b> also induced higher levels of beta interferon RNA and interferon response genes.

To test if MHV nsp 4 residues N 176 and N 237 are glycosylated during virus replication and {{to determine the effects}} of N 176 and N 237 on nsp 4 function and MHV replication, alanine substitutions of nsp 4 N 176, N 237, or both were engineered into the MHV-A 59 genome. The N 176 A, N 237 A, and N 176 A/N 237 A <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> were viable, and N 176 and N 237 were glycosylated during infection of wild-type (wt) and <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses.</b> The nsp 4 glycosylation <b>mutants</b> exhibited impaired <b>virus</b> growth and RNA synthesis, with the N 237 A and N 176 A/N 237 A <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> demonstrating more profound defects in virus growth and RNA synthesis. Electron microscopic analysis of ultrastructure from infected cells demonstrated that the nsp 4 mutants had aberrant morphology of virus-induced double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) compared to those infected with wt virus. The degree of altered DMV morphology directly correlated with the extent of impairment in viral RNA synthesis and virus growth of the nsp 4 <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses.</b> The results indicate that nsp 4 plays a critical role in the organization and stability of DMVs.

We have shown that the ts restriction at 39 degrees C in the replication of the two <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> in tissue culture occurs at a step after virus adsorption but before or including initiation of virus-specific mRNA transcription. At the permissive temperature of 32 degrees C a 12 - to 24 -h delay in the accumulation of mRNA for both <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> in comparison to that of the parental 2 B virus was exhibited.

To examine the role of HSV IgG Fc receptor in viral pathogenesis, rabbits and mice were infected by the corneal route with HSV gE- or gI- mutants. Wild-type HSV- 1 produced large dendritic lesions in the corneal epithelium and subsequent stromal disease leading to viral encephalitis, whereas gE- and gI- <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> produced microscopic punctate or small dendritic lesions in the epithelium and no corneal disease or encephalitis. These differences were not related to the ability of the gE-gI oligomer to bind IgG because the differences were observed before the appearance of anti-HSV IgG and in mice, in which IgG binds to the Fc receptor poorly or not at all. <b>Mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> produced small plaques on monolayers of normal human fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Replication of gE- and gI- <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> in human fibroblasts were normal, and the rates of entry of <b>mutant</b> and wild-type <b>viruses</b> into fibroblasts were similar; however, spread of gE- and gI- <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> from cell to cell was significantly slower than that of wild-type HSV- 1. In experiments in which fibroblast monolayers were infected with low multiplicities of virus and multiple rounds of infection occurred, the presence of neutralizing antibodies in the culture medium caused the yields of <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> to drop dramatically, whereas there was a lesser effect on the production of wild-type HSV. It appears that cell-to-cell transmission of wild-type HSV- 1 occurs by at least two mechanisms: (i) release of virus from cells and entry of extracellular virus into a neighboring cell and (ii) transfer of virus across cell junctions in a manner resistant to neutralizing antibodies. Our results suggest that gE- and gI- mutants are defective in the latter mechanism of spread, suggesting the possibility that the gE-gI complex facilitates virus transfer across cell junctions, a mode of spread which may predominate in some tissues. It is ironic that the gE-gI complex, usually considered an IgG Fc receptor, may, through its ability to mediate cell-to-cell spread, actually protect HSV from IgG in a manner different than previously thought...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} {{function}} of the envelope glycoprotein gH of pseudorabies virus, a gH null mutant was constructed. A premature translation termination codon was introduced in the gH gene by linker insertion mutagenesis, and a <b>mutant</b> <b>virus</b> was rescued by using a cell line that expresses the wild-type protein. <b>Mutant</b> <b>virus</b> isolated from complementing cells was unable to form plaques on noncomplementing cells, indicating that gH is essential in the life cycle of the virus. Immunological staining and electron microscopy showed that the <b>mutant</b> <b>virus</b> produced noninfectious progeny and was unable to spread from infected to uninfected cells by cell-cell fusion. Thus, similar to gH of herpes simplex virus, gH of pseudorabies virus is required for entry and cell-to-cell spread...|$|E
40|$|Bovine {{herpesvirus}} 1 (BHV- 1) is {{an important}} pathogen of cattle that causes respiratory and reproductive disease. BHV- 1 induces latency in sensory ganglia that innervate the site of primary infection. The latency-related (LR) gene is the only BHV- 1 gene abundantly expressed during latency, suggesting that LR gene products regulate the latency/reactivation cycle. A <b>mutant</b> <b>virus</b> with three stop codons {{at the beginning of}} the open reading frames within the LR gene has been constructed in our laboratory (Inman, M, Lovato, L, Doster, A, Jones, C. J. Virol. 75 : 8507 – 8515, 2001). To determine the effects of LR gene products on distinct aspects of BHV- 1 pathogenesis, calves were infected with the LR <b>mutant</b> <b>virus</b> or wt BHV- 1 and virological and molecular studies performed. In situ hybridization demonstrated that the LR <b>mutant</b> <b>virus</b> does not efficiently colonize the trigeminal ganglia (TG) or conjunctiva of infected calves when compared to the wt BHV- 1. Apoptosis analysis by TUNEL assay and immunohistochemistry for cleaved capase 3 indicated that the LR <b>mutant</b> <b>virus</b> induced higher amounts of apoptosis in TG when compared to wt. The ability of the virus to induce latency in lymphoreticular tissues was also examined. Viral DNA was consistently detected in peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC) of calves infected with wt BHV- 1 or LR <b>mutant</b> <b>virus</b> after acute infection, suggesting viral DNA persisted in these cell types. The levels of heat shock proteins (hsp) were examined in cultured cells following infection with wt BHV- 1 or the LR <b>mutant</b> <b>virus.</b> Hsps 60, 70, 90, and 25, protein levels were not dramatically altered after infection. In summary, a mutation in the LR gene of BHV- 1 impaired establishment and reactivation from latency, in part, because LR gene products inhibit apoptosis. In contrast, the LR gene mutation does not appear to affect viral persistence in PBMC. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} the {{adenovirus}} type 5 E 1 B 55 -kDa mutants dl 1520 and dl 338 to replicate efficiently and independently of the cell cycle, to synthesis viral DNA, and to lyse infected cells did not correlate with the status of p 53 in seven cell lines examined. Rather, cell cycle-independent replication and virus-induced cell killing correlated with permissivity to viral replication. This correlation extended to S-phase HeLa cells, which were more susceptible to virus-induced cell killing by the E 1 B 55 -kDa <b>mutant</b> <b>virus</b> than HeLa cells infected during G 1. Wild-type p 53 had only a modest effect on E 1 B <b>mutant</b> <b>virus</b> yields in H 1299 cells expressing a temperature-sensitive p 53 allele. The defect in E 1 B 55 -kDa <b>mutant</b> <b>virus</b> replication resulting from reduced temperature was as much as 10 -fold greater than the defect due to p 53 function. At 39 °C, the E 1 B 55 -kDa mutant viruses produced wild-type yields of virus and replicated independently of the cell cycle. In addition, the E 1 B 55 -kDa mutant viruses directed the synthesis of late viral proteins to levels equivalent to the wild-type virus level at 39 °C. We have previously shown that the defect in <b>mutant</b> <b>virus</b> replication can also be overcome by infecting HeLa cells during S phase. Taken together, {{these results indicate that}} the capacity of the E 1 B 55 -kDa <b>mutant</b> <b>virus</b> to replicate independently of the cell cycle does not correlate with the status of p 53 but is determined by yet unidentified mechanisms. The cold-sensitive nature of the defect of the E 1 B 55 -kDa <b>mutant</b> <b>virus</b> in both late gene expression and cell cycle-independent replication leads us to speculate that these functions of the E 1 B 55 -kDa protein may be linked...|$|E
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 2 (HIV- 2) {{is similar in}} genetic organization to HIV- 1 but contains a unique gene (vpx) that encodes a 16 -kDa protein. A replication-competent molecular clone of HIV- 2 (HIV- 2 sbl/isy) that infects human primary cells in vitro and rhesus monkeys was used to generate three mutations in the vpx gene. In the first mutant, the vpx open reading frame was truncated at amino acid 20; the second mutant was tailored to eliminate the proline-rich carboxyl terminus of the protein; and the third mutant was obtained by addition of four amino acids (KDEL) to the carboxyl terminus of the protein to provide a retention signal in the endoplasmic reticulum. The viral infection kinetics of the three <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> and isogeneic HIV- 2 sbl/isy in the SupT 1 cell line were similar. Slight impairment in the early phases of viral replication was observed during infection of primary human {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} with the vpx <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses.</b> All of the vpx <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> readily infected macrophages, indicating that vpx expression is dispensable for HIV- 2 infection and replication in human macrophages...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{molecular}} mechanisms involved in plant virus–vector interactions {{is essential for}} the development of effective control measures for aphid-vectored epidemic plant diseases. The coat proteins (CP) are the main component of the viral capsids, and they are implicated in practically every stage of the viral infection cycle. Pea enation mosaic virus 1 (PEMV 1, Enamovirus, Luteoviridae) and Pea enation mosaic virus 2 (PEMV 2, Umbravirus, Tombusviridae) are two RNA viruses in an obligate symbiosis causing the pea enation mosaic disease. Sixteen <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> were generated with mutations in different domains of the CP to evaluate the role of specific amino acids in viral replication, virion assembly, long-distance movement in Pisum sativum, and aphid transmission. Twelve <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> were unable to assemble but were able to replicate in inoculated leaves, move long-distance, and express the CP in newly infected leaves. Four <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> produced virions, but three were not transmissible by the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum. Three-dimensional modeling of the PEMV CP, combined with biological assays for virion assembly and aphid transmission, allowed for a model of the assembly of PEMV coat protein subunits...|$|R
40|$|The matrix domain (MA) is {{important}} for targeting of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Gag assembly to the plasma membrane, envelope incorporation into virions, preintegration complex import into the nucleus, and nuclear export of viral RNA. Myristylation and phosphorylation are key regulatory events for MA function. Previous {{studies have indicated that}} MA phosphorylation at serine (Ser) residues {{is important}} for viral replication. This study defines the molecular mechanisms of virus particle assembly and infectivity through a detailed study of the role of MA serine phosphorylation. We show that the combined mutation of Ser residues at positions 9, 67, 72, and 77 impairs viral infectivity in dividing and nondividing cells, although the assembly of these Ser <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> is comparable to that of wild-type virus. This defect can be rescued by pseudotyping these <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> with vesicular stomatitis virus G protein, suggesting that these serine residues are critical in an early postentry step of viral infection. The phosphorylation level of MA in defective <b>mutant</b> <b>viruses</b> was severely reduced compared to that of the wild type, suggesting that phosphorylation of Ser- 9, - 67, - 72, and - 77 {{is important for}} an early postentry step during virus infection...|$|R
