40|$|Direct chill (DC) casting {{is widely}} used to produce {{aluminium}} ingots and billets. One of the issues with such castings is the oxide generated especially during the filling of the casting table in the start-up phase. This oxide can affect {{the performance of the}} product during subsequent extrusion. While the very first <b>material</b> is <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> and discarded the distribution of oxides along the cast length is not known. It is therefore highly desirable to have an ability to predict the amount and distribution of the oxide generated during the process start-up. In this paper, we use the mesh-free Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method to model the mould filling phase of DC casting. The free surface nature of the flow during this phase is especially amenable to the mesh-free SPH modelling technique. Additionally this method is very suitable for predicting surface driven and history dependent properties such as oxides. The paper presents preliminary predictions of cumulative interior and exterior oxide levels with time in a typical DC casting operation. The amount of interior oxide will indicate the effect of oxide on the final metal microstructure. The amount of exterior oxide determines the surface quality of the billet...|$|R

30|$|Coating cathode {{materials}} with metallic oxides {{are able to}} significantly improve the cycle performances of LNMO. This is attributed {{to the fact that}} the surface coating of cathode <b>materials</b> can <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> the cathode contact with the electrolyte and suppress the dissolution of active substances. Fan et al. [93] investigated the morphology, structures, and performances of the SiO 2 -coated LNMO cathode materials for HVLIBs. The results indicate that the surfaces of the coated LNMO samples were covered with porous, amorphous, nanostructured SiO 2 layers and the capacity retention rates were obviously improved. Lee et al. [94] utilized SnO 2 coating to modify LNMO cathode by employing electron cyclotron resonance metal–organic chemical vapor deposition and a conventional tape-casting method. The SnO 2 -deposited LNMO electrodes exhibit superior electrochemical performances during the storage test in a fully charged state than the pristine LNMO electrode. Wang et al. [4] synthesized V 2 O 5 -coated LNMO cathode materials via a wet-coating method. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images showed clear lattice fringes of all LNMO samples, and the V 2 O 5 coating layer was about 3  nm in 5 % V 2 O 5 -LNMO sample. The selected area electron diffraction pattern (SAED) suggested that the LNMO sample was of ordered lattice and single-crystal structure. The cycling performances profiles of different materials showed that the 5 % V 2 O 5 -LNMO sample had the best performance. V 2 O 5 as a protective layer inhibited the electrolyte decomposition at the electrode/electrolyte interface, offered a 2 D path for Li+ diffusion, and reduced metal-ion dissolution, thereby improving the structure integrity and capacity retention during charge/discharge cycles.|$|R
40|$|Fullerenes are wonder {{molecules}} that possess {{a range of}} exotic properties such as superconductivity, ferromagnetism, anti-HIV bioactivity and optical limiting effects. Synthesis of functionalized fullerene derivatives, polymers, and glasses is of great interest from viewpoints of both basic research and practical applications. We envision that fullerene materials may exhibit novel optical properties because of their intriguing three-dimensional conjugated molecular structures. In this study, we have synthesised a range of new fullerene materials and investigated their optical properties. We have successfully integrated C 60 into solid matrixes of inorganic glasses and optical polymers through covalent bonding. We functionalized C 60 by amination and then chemically incorporated C 60 into a silica host using a sol-gel reaction. For C 60 -containing optical polymers, Several methods including free radical polymerization, Friedel-Crafts reaction, thermolysis and photolysis reactions were used to chemically incorporate C 60 into PMMA, PS, PVC, PC and CR- 39. All the C 60 -containing glasses and polymer films are morphologically homogenous with high optical quality and exhibit excellent optical limiting characteristics. Although C 60 itself transmits light as normal as a common compound, surprisingly {{we have found that}} C 60 -containing glasses and optical polymers exhibit "abnormal" transmission characteristics. We can use the fullerene <b>materials</b> to <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> light of specific wavelengths over almost entire ultraviolet and visible spectral range by simply changing their C 60 contents. The phenomenon is truly unusual, which can hardly be predicted from classical Beer's law.

40|$|International audienceTo make polymer {{solar cells}} (PSCs) a {{competitive}} market technology, integrated efforts are required toward the development of highly efficient light harvesting and charge transporting materials with good thermal and photochemical stability, and which can be processed from solution. Nowadays, a critical issue to be solved is enhancing the stability and durability of PSCs. Indeed, the photoactive material used in the active layer dictates {{the efficiency of the}} device on the one hand but, on the other hand, {{it is well known that}} organic materials are unstable when exposed to light irradiation, which provokes a degradation of their properties. Making long lifetime solar cells with polymers that are susceptible to degradation under light exposure could be an unrealistic challenge. Therefore, elucidating the mechanism of polymer photodegradation is a key point for developing strategies to decrease or prevent the loss of the functional properties of the material. In this paper, the basic concepts of polymer photo-aging are explained first. Then the photodegradation mechanisms of conjugated polymers currently used in PSCs are reported. Finally, as barrier <b>materials</b> able to <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> moisture and oxygen ingress are essential for the stability of PSCs, methods for designing coatings for PSC encapsulation are presented, based on recent publications. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industr...|$|R
