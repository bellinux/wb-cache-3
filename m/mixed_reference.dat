50|$|The World Bank {{reviewed}} and proposed revisions in May 2014, to its poverty calculation methodology and purchasing power parity basis for measuring poverty worldwide, including India. According to this revised methodology, {{the world had}} 872.3 million people below the new poverty line, of which 179.6 million people lived in India. In other words, India with 17.5% of total world's population, had 20.6% share of world's poorest in 2011. As of 2014, 58% {{of the total population}} were living on less than $3.10 per day. According to the Modified <b>Mixed</b> <b>Reference</b> Period (MMRP) concept proposed by World Bank in 2015, India's poverty rate for period 2011-12 stood at 12.4% of the total population, or about 172 million people; taking the revised poverty line as $1.90.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{research}} aimed (1) at examining {{whether or}} not there was significant influence of the variables, such as marketing <b>mix,</b> <b>reference</b> group, demography and socioeconomic on the consumer’s behavior in deciding to purchase a house; and (2) at examining which variables have more dominant influence on the consumer’s decision making. The population of this research consisted of houses type 36 purchasers through the BTN Bank Credit in Jember. The sampling technique used was the purposive proportional area random sampling, whereas the data collecting methods used were questionnaire, interview and documentation. Marketing mix as an independent variable covered: product (X 1), price (X 2), place (X 3), promotion (X 4), personal traits (X 5), physical evidence (X 6) and process (X 7). Reference group covered: family (X 8), colleagues (X 9) and neighbors (X 10). Demography and Socio-economic was covered by Family Income (X 11). The dependent variable (Y) was the decision making to purchase houses. The data analyses used were firstly, the descriptive analysis to describe the fieldwork data by interpreting the data through tabulation, and secondly, the multiple Linear Regression Statistics to analyze the influence of the independent variables (X 1 – X 11) both in group and individually on the decision making process to buy the houses. The research results indicated that marketing <b>mix,</b> <b>reference</b> group, and demography and socioeconomic constituted the variables to be considered and believed to influence the consumers’ decision-making process to buy the houses. The result of multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that in a group marketing <b>mix,</b> <b>reference</b> group, demography and socioeconomic significantly affected the consumer’s behavior in deciding to buy houses. Individually, the dependent variables (X 1 -X 11) significantly affected the dependent variables (Y), and certainly the product variable (X 1) and the family income variable (X 11) had dominant influence. Other variables served as the supporting variables.   Keywords: consumer behaviour, purchasing house</p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the levels {{and changes in}} poverty indicators of the rural and urban population in India disaggregated by social and economic groups. The analysis {{is based on the}} comparable estimates of poverty on the <b>mixed</b> <b>reference</b> period computed from the unit record data for the 50 th (1993 - 94) and the 55 th (1999 - 2000) rounds of the Consumer Expenditure Surveys conducted by the National Sample Survey Organisation. The issue is how far different social and economic groups shared the overall decline in poverty in the 1990 s. Four poverty indicators are considered, namely, headcount ratio, the depth and severity measures (PGI and FGT*) as also the absolute size of the poor population. The social groups most vulnerable to poverty have been identified to be the scheduled caste households and the scheduled tribe households with both these groups having above average levels of poverty indicators in the rural and the urban population. Among the economic groups, the most vulnerable groups are the agricultural labour households (rural) and the casual labour households (urban) each having {{the highest levels of the}} poverty indicators in their respective population segments. In terms of changes in poverty in the 1990 s, it is found that while the scheduled caste and the agricultural labour (rural) and the casual labour (urban) households experienced declines in poverty on par with the total population, the scheduled tribe households fared badly in both the segments. A further disaggregated analysis brings out the consequences for poverty of combined social and economic vulnerabilities. The paper also presents poverty indicators adjusted for between-(economic and social) group disparity and discusses the implications of the empirical results for the design of a strategy for poverty reduction.

40|$|Background: The {{associations}} between {{internal and external}} measures of training load and intensity are important in understanding the training process and the validity of specific internal measures. Objectives: We aimed to provide meta-analytic estimates of the relationships, as determined by a correlation coefficient, between internal and external measures of load and intensity during team-sport training and competition. A further aim {{was to examine the}} moderating effects of training mode on these relationships. Methods: We searched six electronic databases (Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, MEDLINE, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL) for original research articles published up to September 2017. A Boolean search phrase was created to include search terms relevant to team-sport athletes (population; 37 keywords), internal load (dependent variable; 35 keywords), and external load (independent variable; 81 keywords). Articles were considered for meta-analysis when a correlation coefficient describing the association between at least one internal and one external measure of session load or intensity, measured in the time or frequency domain, was obtained from team-sport athletes during normal training or match-play (i. e., unstructured observational study). The final data sample included 122 estimates from 13 independent studies describing 15 unique relationships between three internal and nine external measures of load and intensity. This sample included 295 athletes and 10, 418 individual session observations. Internal measures were session ratings of perceived exertion (sRPE), sRPE training load (sRPE-TL), and heart-rate-derived training impulse (TRIMP). External measures were total distance (TD), the distance covered at high and very high speeds (HSRD ≥ 13. 1 – 15. 0 km h− 1 and VHSRD ≥ 16. 9 – 19. 8 km h− 1, respectively), accelerometer load (AL), and the number of sustained impacts (Impacts > 2 – 5 G). Distinct training modes were identified as either <b>mixed</b> (<b>reference</b> condition), skills, metabolic, or neuromuscular. Separate random effects meta-analyses were conducted for each dataset (n = 15) to determine the pooled relationships between internal and external measures of load and intensity. The moderating effects of training mode were examined using random-effects meta-regression for datasets with at least ten estimates (n = 4). Magnitude-based inferences were used to interpret analyses outcomes. Results: During all training modes combined, the external load relationships for sRPE-TL were possibly very large with TD [r = 0. 79; 90...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{whether the}} influence of reference price discrepancy on consumer post-purchase satisfaction depends {{on the type of}} price discrepancy. Based on Bolton, Warlop, and Alba's (2003) transaction space framework, this thesis proposes that {{the influence of}} reference price discrepancy on satisfaction can be classified into three types: across-time price discrepancy, across-consumer price discrepancy, and across-firm price discrepancy. The thesis proposes and tests a satisfaction model that incorporates types of reference price discrepancy, based on perceived fairness, retrospective regret, and disappointment in six experiments. Experiment 1 identifies a negative relationship between perceived fairness of a situation and retrospective regret, independent of the outcomes of comparable others. The findings in experiment 1 are replicated in another context in experiment 2. The findings are generalized beyond price as an attribute into performance in experiment 3. The findings suggest that self-blame mediates the negative relationship between fairness and regret, supporting a just-world explanation. Experiment 4 demonstrates that the influences of reference price discrepancies on perceived fairness, retrospective regret, and disappointment are type-dependent. Experiment 5 provides explanations to as why the influences of reference price discrepancy on fairness, regret, and disappointment are type-dependent. The finding suggests that satisfaction models examining only one antecedent of satisfaction and models without considering retrospective regret have reduced goodness of fit indices and have inflated estimators than the proposed and other alternative models. Finally, experiment 6 demonstrates how <b>mixed</b> <b>reference</b> price information can be separated into its components. This method allows future research to incorporate multidimensional reference price information in research following a generalized utility model. The findings of this thesis have implications for satisfaction modeling, reference price typology, and differential pricing practice. This thesis sends a simple and direct message to marketing practitioners that fairness is the most important antecedent of satisfaction. Tang, Tzu Lung Felix. Adviser: Jian-min Jamie Jia.

40|$|Measurements of {{ambient dose}} {{equivalent}} in stray radiation fields behind the shielding of high-energy accelerators are a challenging task. Several radiation components (photons, neutrons, charged particles, muons, etc.), spanning {{a wide range of}} energies, contribute to the total dose equivalent. The radiation fields are produced by beam losses interacting with structural material during the acceleration or at the ejection to experimental areas or other accelerators. The particle beam is usually not continuous but separated in "bunches" or pulses, which further complicates dose measurements at high-energy accelerators. An ideal dosimeter for operational radiation protection should measure dose equivalent for any composition of radiation components in the entire energy range even when the field is strongly pulsed. The objective of this work was to find out if an ionisation chamber operated as a "recombination chamber" and a TEPC instrument using the variance-covariance method ("Sievert Instrument") are capable of assessing the {{ambient dose equivalent}} in radiation fields with short pulses. The results are compared to those of a conventional TEPC instrument (HANDI-TEPC) and to the total dose equivalent values obtained from the suitable combination of readings from instruments currently used at CERN. These instruments are a combination of several detectors with different characteristics measuring individual dose fractions (i. e. an argon-filled chamber, a hydrogen-filled chamber and a rem ionisation chamber). The HANDI-TEPC is usually the preferred reference instrument in mixed radiation fields of unknown composition at CERN, but in strongly pulsed fields it fails because of pile-up effects. Although the mixed stray radiation fields differ strongly from those applied in standard calibration, the first step in using a radiation protection instrument is the intensive study and characterisation of the detector behaviour in reference fields of calibration sources. This forms the basis for improving the reliability and accuracy of measurements in unknown radiation fields. The next step is to test the detectors in <b>mixed</b> <b>reference</b> fields, which simulate workplace fields but are produced under laboratory conditions. At CERN, an opportunity for such a reference field is realized by the CERF-field (CERN-EU high-energy reference field). The field provides a mixed field of mainly neutrons ranging from thermal energies up to hundreds of GeV accompanied by photons and muons. At CERF the HANDI-TEPC was known to be suitable {{to be used as a}} reference instrument for the total dose equivalent. For this reason the results of the recombination chamber and Sievert Instrument were compared to those of the HANDI-TEPC for several reference locations and different beam intensities. In particular, the background radiation at CERF was studied, which has a non-negligible influence on the total dose equivalent and is strongly dependent on the reference location. At CERF, a very good agreement between the instruments was found. Finally the instruments were investigated in an unknown mixed stray radiation field with short pulses on the "PS-bridge". This PS-bridge is a location where 260 cm of concrete shield the beam line of the PS accelerator. The operation of the PS at CERN is composed of a supercycle of 16. 8 s divided in 14 cycles of 1. 2 s each. The duration of the particle pulse can be as short as 10 µs. In such a field the HANDI-TEPC was not able to resolve the single events within one particle pulse because of pile-up effects. The recombination chamber and the Sievert Instrument, however, appear to be capable of assessing the total dose equivalent correctly provided that the response is interpreted carefully by using appropriate corrections and calibration factors...|$|E
