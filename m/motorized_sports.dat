History and Assessment of Current Situation: The Elaho Valley was formed in geologic time when the Pacific, North American and Juan De Fuca Plates collided and formed the Coast Mountain Chain. The Fraser Glaciation smoothed out the landscape of British Columbia and receded approximately 10, 000 years ago and was then settled by the First Nations. This area, also known as the Elaho Valley is located near Whistler, British Columbia. The Valley is comprised of temperate coniferous forests with Cedar trees that have been dated back over 1, 000 years. The forests ecosystems that are present within the area include; Alpine Tundra in the higher elevations, Interio...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this health {{consultation}} is to discuss public health issues that may result from being a participant in, or spectator of, indoor <b>motorized</b> <b>sporting</b> events and to make health recommendations to protect persons involved in these activities. The specific case illustrating this discussion concerns the non-fatal poisoning of several children by carbon monoxide (CO). The children had been participating in motocross events at an indoor track that was formerly a golf dome. The local health department and a state legislator asked the Michigan Department of Community Health (MDCH) for a public health opinion regarding the case. MDCH conducted this health consultation for the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) under a cooperative agreement. ATSDR conducts public health activities (assessments/consultations, advisories, education) at sites of environmental contamination and concern. ATSDR is primarily an advisory agency. Therefore, its reports usually identify what actions are appropriate to be undertaken by the regulatory agency overseeing the site, other responsible parties, or the research or education divisions of ATSDR. As such, ATSDR recommendations may not encompass all types {{of federal and state}} requirements from a regulatory perspective. Thus, the purpose of a health consultation is not to evaluate or confirm regulatory compliance but to determine if any potentially harmful exposures are occurring or may occur in the future. Prepared by the Michigan Department of Community Health under a cooperative agreement with the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Division of Health Assessment and Consultation.

5000|$|Endangered by {{the early}} 1970s, this species of gazelle was in serious decline. They were hunted firstly by mounted then by <b>motorized</b> hunters for <b>sport,</b> meat, or their horns, which were sold as {{ornaments}} in North African markets. The threats the animals face now include poaching, disturbance by humans and loss of suitable habitat.

50|$|Immediately to {{the east}} of the {{originally}} Methodist Regina College complex is the former Anglican Diocesan property. This has not been absorbed into the Wascana Centre, but is being commercially developed with considerable strictures to maintain the historic ecclesiastical structures and green space. It contains the former St Chad's College (originally an Anglican theological seminary, which formally vacated to the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon), the Qu'Appelle Diocesan School (the Anglican Sisters of St John the Divine maintained St Chad's private girls' school on the premises until 1970 but the Anglican Church, like the United Church, no longer maintains any secondary or tertiary education involvement in Regina); the former Bishops Court and assorted ecclesiastical structures. The entire property was sold to the provincial Crown in the 1970s and has now been further sold for residential and commercial development.The Centre also contains attractive venues for cross country skiing and skating during winter and tennis, bicycling, running, and <b>motorized</b> water <b>sports</b> during summer. It is also the training centre for Wascana Racing Canoe Club and the Regina Rowing Club. Much of the lake-bottom dredgings from the deepening of Wascana Lake were added to an existing artificial hill on the north shore of the lake, across from the new campus of the University, creating a much larger winter toboggan run.|$|R
