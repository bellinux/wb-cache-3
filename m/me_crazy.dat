Varsity Blues drew a domestic box office gross of US$53 million. Also in 1999, she made supporting appearances in the teen comedies Giving It Up and Drive <b>Me</b> <b>Crazy,</b> and starred in the remake House on Haunted Hill which was made for around US$20 million.

Thomas highlighted the scene in which a girl shows Veronica around the sorority as indicative of Hansen's comedic talents; in addition, it marked the first appearance of David Tom in the season, a guest star in season two who was brought back for a recurring role in this season.

Portnoy stated that while he appreciated the devotion of Dream Theater's fans, he was frustrated because he was [...] "constantly tearing [...] away from [...] family" [...] to give more to the fans. He found it discouraging that, even though he spent [...] "countless nights" [...] writing special setlists and the band spent days rehearsing, some fans would still complain that they went to a show and did not hear [...] "Pull Me Under".

500|$|In May 1999, Max Martin and Spears {{went to the}} Battery Studios in New York City, New York, to re-record the vocals of [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy", due to {{the fact}} that a remixed version called [...] "The Stop!

500|$|Sibelius {{continued}} to make changes to {{the final version of}} the tone poem as he sailed across the Atlantic Ocean aboard the steamship SS Kaiser Wilhelm II and even during rehearsals in Norfolk, but these last-minute changes, Andrew Barnett argues, must have been relatively [...] "minor", as the orchestral parts had been copied before his departure from Finland. Sibelius was delighted with the new piece, writing to Aino, [...] "It's as though I have found myself, and more besides. The Fourth Symphony was the start. But in this piece there is so much more. There are passages in it that drive <b>me</b> <b>crazy.</b> Such poetry". Neither the suite nor the Yale version of the tone poem was performed in Sibelius's lifetime, receiving their world premieres by Osmo Vänskä and the Lahti Symphony Orchestra on 19September and 24October 2002, respectively.|$|E
500|$|After Grant {{captured}} Fort Donelson, Sherman got {{his wish}} to serve under Grant {{when he was}} assigned on March 1, 1862, to the Army of West Tennessee as commander of the 5th Division. His first major test under Grant was at the Battle of Shiloh. The massive Confederate attack {{on the morning of}} April 6, 1862, took most of the senior Union commanders by surprise. Sherman had dismissed the intelligence reports received from militia officers, refusing to believe that Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston would leave his base at Corinth. He took no precautions beyond strengthening his picket lines, and refused to entrench, build abatis, or push out reconnaissance patrols. At Shiloh, he may have wished to avoid appearing overly alarmed in order to escape the kind of criticism he had received in Kentucky. He had written to his wife that, if he took more precautions, [...] "they'd call <b>me</b> <b>crazy</b> again".|$|E

500|$|The Oops!... I Did It Again Tour was {{the third}} concert tour by American {{recording}} artist Britney Spears. It supported her second studio album Oops!... I Did It Again (2000) and visited North America, Europe and Brazil. It {{marked the first time}} Spears toured outside North America. The tour was announced in February 2000, while Spears {{was in the midst of}} the (You Drive <b>Me)</b> <b>Crazy</b> Tour. The stage was much more elaborate than her previous tours and featured video screens, pyrotechnics and moving platforms. The setlist was composed by songs from her first two studio albums, ...Baby One More Time and Oops!... I Did It Again as well as a few covers. Showco was the sound company, who used the PRISM system to adapt the show to each venue. Spears used a handheld microphone and a headset during the shows, while an ADAT was used to replace her voice during energetic dance routines.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began in}} New York in October 1986. Madonna {{would ask for}} five minutes to study the script for the scene they were filming. For example, before {{a scene in which}} she needed to appear out of breath, she did a series of push-ups before going on set. Dunne {{observed}} that [...] " [...] likes her first take best. I think my best is around fourth. She always says, 'You got it, you got it,' and she was driving <b>me</b> <b>crazy</b> just like her character would. We had to make a compromise as to which take is the best." [...] Madonna wanted Foley to give her proper direction on set, but he preferred her to be her real self, rather than the persona in her music videos. Regarding her acting abilities, Foley stressed on the fact that Madonna was very uptight and into every detail, determined to have the correct portrayal. [...] "That's probably why it wasn't so good. In Desperately Seeking Susan, when she didn't know what she was doing, she was being natural and at her best." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Nigel Dick and filmed on June 14 and 15, 1999 at the Redondo Beach, California.

[...] At the time, Spears expected that the video would take her [...] "to the next level". To promote the film Drive <b>Me</b> <b>Crazy,</b> actors Adrian Grenier and Melissa Joan Hart were invited to make cameo appearances in the video, since the song had been included on the film's soundtrack, however, Grenier did not want to participate. Dick commented on the issue, saying, [...] "I was given instructions to ring him up and make sure he appeared in the video. I said, 'You know what, Adrian, I just think it would be great for your career, and Britney's a great girl and she's fun to work with.' Eventually he came around." [...] Dick also revealed that he was impressed by the singer's work ethic, adding that she [...] "came to the set completely rehearsed." [...] The music video premiered on MTV's Making the Video special that aired on July 18, 1999.|$|E

[...] He was {{scratched}} by {{the track}} veterinarian {{from the first}} race into which he was entered; he had been slightly injured when the horse next to him reared and flipped over in the starting gate. He was entered in another race a week later, a maiden race in which he finished second, losing to a colt named Gourmet Dinner. After that race, Mucho Macho Man was purchased by Reeves Thoroughbred Racing. [...] Dean and Patti Reeves had considered purchasing Gourmet Dinner, but Dean Reeves recalled saying at the time, [...] "Call <b>me</b> <b>crazy,</b> but I like the second horse." [...] After the sale, Tim Ritvo took over the training of Mucho Macho Man from his original trainer, Bill White. The colt came in third at his next race, at Saratoga in New York state; {{he won his first}} race on September19, 2010, at Monmouth Park in New Jersey. After that race, the colt's training was turned over to Kathy Ritvo when Tim began working for Gulfstream Park. In November 2010, Mucho Macho Man moved up to graded class and finished second behind To Honor and Serve twice in a row at Aqueduct Racetrack in New York City, first in the Nashua Stakes and then in the Remsen Stakes. Throughout his two-year-old year the young horse was easily distracted, so he raced with blinkers for both White and Ritvo.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Anything Goes" [...] / [...] "Anything You Can Do" [...] mash-up {{was widely}} acclaimed. Respers France named Pearce's {{performance}} the best {{moment of the}} episode, {{and found that the}} character positively reminded her of [...] "Glee of old". The song was also a favorite of Lee's, who wrote that the intensity of the actress was perfectly matched to the character's disposition. West, Slezak and Benigno gave the performance an [...] "A"; the former called it an [...] "outstanding rendition" [...] which [...] "felt like it belonged on a big stage or in a big-screen musical", and the latter two praised her vocal talent, which Benigno deemed unequalled on Glee. Futterman and Bell found Harmony a credible rival to Rachel vocally, and eagerly anticipated future competition between them. Urban called Pearce's performance merely [...] "serviceable". Though she felt her acting was a weak point, she compared her favorably to season two guest star Charice and praised her vocals. Criticism came from New York Lindy West, who did not understand Rachel's humiliation, as New Directions [...] "sing way more elaborate and equally competent arrangements four to five times an episode". She elaborated, [...] "This is a thing that drives <b>me</b> <b>crazy</b> about Glee. As a viewer, there's no knowing whether a performance was 'good' like 'Anything Goes,' or 'bad' like 'We've Got the Beat,' until Rachel starts crying or some cheerleader starts throwing spaghetti." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{recording}} {{her debut}} album, Spears had originally envisioned it in style of [...] "Sheryl Crow music, [...] but younger [...] more adult contemporary". However, the singer agreed with her label's appointment of producers, {{who had the}} objective to target a teenage audience at the time. She flew to Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, where half of the album was recorded from March to April 1998, with producers Max Martin, Denniz Pop and Rami Yacoub, among others. [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] was written by Jörgen Elofsson, while song production and additional songwriting was done by Martin, Per Magnusson and David Kreuger.
