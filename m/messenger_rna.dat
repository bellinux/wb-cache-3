5|$|Polyadenylation is the {{addition}} of a poly(A) tail to a <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA.</b> The poly(A) tail consists of multiple adenosine monophosphates; in other words, it is a stretch of RNA that has only adenine bases. In eukaryotes, polyadenylation is part of the process that produces mature <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> (mRNA) for translation. It, therefore, forms part of the larger process of gene expression.|$|E
5|$|In transcription, the codons {{of a gene}} are copied into <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> by RNA polymerase. This RNA copy is then decoded by a {{ribosome}} {{that reads}} the RNA sequence by base-pairing the <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> to transfer RNA, which carries amino acids. Since there are 4 bases in 3-letter combinations, there are 64 possible codons (43combinations). These encode the twenty standard amino acids, giving most amino acids more than one possible codon. There are also three 'stop' or 'nonsense' codons signifying {{the end of the}} coding region; these are the TAA, TGA, and TAG codons.|$|E
5|$|Most known RNA {{thermometers}} {{are located}} in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> encoding heat shock proteins—though it has been suggested this fact may be due, in part, to sampling bias and inherent difficulties of detecting short, unconserved RNA sequences in genomic data.|$|E

5|$|Gene {{expression}} first involves transcription, {{in which}} DNA {{is used as}} a template to produce RNA. In the case of genes encoding proteins, that RNA produced from this process is <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> (mRNA), which then needs to be translated by ribosomes to form a protein. As ribosomes are located outside the nucleus, mRNA produced needs to be exported.|$|E
5|$|<b>Messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> (mRNA) is RNA {{that has}} a coding region {{that acts as a}} {{template}} for protein synthesis (translation). The rest of the mRNA, the untranslated regions, tune how active the mRNA is. There are also many RNAs that are not translated, called non-coding RNAs. Like the untranslated regions, many of these non-coding RNAs have regulatory roles.|$|E

40|$|Male {{germ cells}} have a complex transcriptome. In {{addition}} to proteincoding <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs,</b> many noncoding RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), are produced. The miRNAs are important regulators of gene expression. They function mainly post-transcriptionally {{to control the}} stability or translation of their target <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs.</b> The miRNAs are expressed in a cell-specific manner during spermatogenesis {{to participate in the}} control of each stage of male germ cell differentiation. Clinical studies have exploited the well-defined expression profiles of miRNAs, and human spermatozoal or seminal plasma miRNAs have been explored as potential biomarkers for male factor infertility...|$|R

5|$|<b>Messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> (mRNA) is the RNA {{that carries}} {{information}} from DNA to the ribosome, {{the sites of}} protein synthesis (translation) in the cell. The coding sequence of the mRNA determines the amino acid sequence in the protein that is produced. However, many RNAs do not code for protein (about 97% of the transcriptional output is non-protein-coding in eukaryotes).|$|E
5|$|The oxazolidinones are protein {{synthesis}} inhibitors: they stop {{the growth and}} reproduction of bacteria by disrupting translation of <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> (mRNA) into proteins in the ribosome.

5|$|Transfer RNA (tRNA) {{is a small}} RNA {{chain of}} about 80 {{nucleotides}} that transfers a specific amino acid to a growing polypeptide chain at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during translation.

The increase in both types of isoferritins is accompanied {{by an increase in}} the amount of <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> specific for H and L subunits. The increase in the amount of these <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs,</b> which occurs in the nucleus {{as well as in the}} cytoplasm, is proportionately lower than the increase in the protein. These results, together with analysis of transcription in isolated nuclei indicate the existence of a mechanism of transcriptional control of ferritin synthesis, associated to the translational control described so far...|$|R
50|$|Some {{molecules}} or macromolecular complexes {{need to be}} exported {{from the}} nucleus to the cytoplasm, as do ribosome subunits and <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs.</b> Thus there is an export mechanism similar to the import mechanism.|$|R
5|$|A gene is a {{sequence}} of DNA that contains genetic information and can influence the phenotype of an organism. Within a gene, the sequence of bases along a DNA strand defines a <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> sequence, which then defines one or more protein sequences. The relationship between the nucleotide sequences of genes and the amino-acid sequences of proteins {{is determined by the}} rules of translation, known collectively as the genetic code. The genetic code consists of three-letter 'words' called codons formed from {{a sequence}} of three nucleotides (e.g. ACT, CAG, TTT).|$|E
5|$|In all organisms, {{two steps}} are {{required}} to read the information encoded in a gene's DNA and produce the protein it specifies. First, the gene's DNA is transcribed to <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> (mRNA). Second, that mRNA is translated to protein. RNA-coding genes must still go through the first step, but are not translated into protein. The process of producing a biologically functional molecule of either RNA or protein is called gene expression, and the resulting molecule is called a gene product.|$|E
5|$|Transcription is {{the process}} where {{information}} in DNA, called the genetic code, is used to produce RNA copies called <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> (mRNA). These migrate through the cell and carry the code to ribosomes where {{it is used to}} make proteins. This is called translation because the protein's amino acid structure is determined by the mRNA's code. Information is hence translated from the language of nucleic acids to the language of amino acids.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{biochemical}} {{studies have}} demonstrated that {{at least part of the}} RNA stored in ovulated mouse oocytes is synthesized during their growth phase (1). Those studies, however, failed to detect incorporation of RNA precursors during the 4 -day preovulatory period, which includes part of the 5 -day growth-quiescent phase (12), germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), chromosomal condensation, and the first meiotic division. As previously suggested (16), RNA synthesized just before GVBD could include <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> coding for proteins involved in those events of maturation, as distinct from ribosomal and <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> to be stored for use in early embryogenesis.

50|$|This microRNA {{database}} and microRNA targets databases is {{a compilation of}} databases and web portals and servers used for microRNAs and their targets.

5|$|Two {{types of}} small ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules– microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA)– {{are central to}} RNA interference. RNAs are the direct {{products}} of genes, and these small RNAs can bind to other specific <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> (mRNA) molecules and either increase or decrease their activity, for example by preventing an mRNA from being translated into a protein. RNA interference has {{an important role in}} defending cells against parasitic nucleotide sequences– viruses and transposons. It also influences development.|$|E
5|$|Amatoxins {{consist of}} at least eight {{compounds}} with a similar structure, that of eight amino-acid rings; of those found in A. ocreata, α-amanitin is the most prevalent and along with β-amanitin {{is likely to be}} responsible for the toxic effects. The major toxic mechanism is the inhibition of RNA polymerase II, a vital enzyme in the synthesis of <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> (mRNA), microRNA, and small nuclear RNA (snRNA). Without mRNA, essential protein synthesis and hence cell metabolism stop and the cell dies. The liver is the principal organ affected, as it is the first organ encountered after absorption by the gastrointestinal tract, though other organs, especially the kidneys, are susceptible to the toxins.|$|E
5|$|Approximately half of {{all known}} {{antibiotics}} interfere with the workings of a bacteria's ribosome, a large and complex biochemical machine that performs protein biosynthesis by translating <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> into proteins. Macrolide antibiotics clog the ribosome's exit tunnel, preventing synthesis of essential bacterial proteins. In 2007, the Pande lab received a grant to study and design new antibiotics. In 2008, they used Folding@home to study the interior of this tunnel and how specific molecules may affect it. The full structure of the ribosome was determined only as of 2011, and Folding@home has also simulated ribosomal proteins, as many of their functions remain largely unknown.|$|E
25|$|Estimates of {{the average}} number of unique <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> that are targets for {{repression}} by a typical miRNA vary, depending on the estimation method, but multiple approaches show that mammalian miRNAs can have many unique targets. For example, an analysis of the miRNAs highly conserved in vertebrates shows that each has, on average, roughly 400 conserved targets. Likewise, experiments show that a single miRNA species can reduce the stability of hundreds of unique <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs.</b> Other experiments show that a single miRNA species may repress the production of hundreds of proteins, but that this repression often is relatively mild (much less than 2-fold). The first human disease associated with deregulation of miRNAs was chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Other B cell malignancies followed.|$|R
50|$|The {{expression}} of oncogenes can be regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs), small RNAs 21-25 nucleotides in length that control gene expression by downregulating them. Mutations in such microRNAs (known as oncomirs) {{can lead to}} activation of oncogenes. Antisense <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> could theoretically be used to block the effects of oncogenes.|$|R
40|$|Alternative pre-messenger RNA {{splicing}} is {{an important}} mechanism for generating protein diversity and may explain in part how mammalian complexity arises from a surprisingly small complement of genes. Here, we describe “digital polony exon profiling,”a single molecule–based technology for studying complex alternative pre-messenger RNA splicing. This technology allows researchers to monitor the combinatorial diversity of exon inclusion in individual transcripts. A minisequencing strategy provides single nucleotide resolution, and the digital nature of the technology allows quantitation of individual splicing variants. Digital polony exon profiling {{can be used to}} investigate the physiological and pathological roles of alternately spliced <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs,</b> as well as the mechanisms by which these <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs</b> are produced.

5|$|Poliovirus is a positive-stranded RNA virus. Thus, {{the genome}} {{enclosed}} within the viral particle {{can be used}} as <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> and immediately translated by the host cell. On entry, the virus hijacks the cell's translation machinery, causing inhibition of cellular protein synthesis in favor of virus–specific protein production. Unlike the host cell's mRNAs, the 5'end of poliovirus RNA is extremely long—over 700 nucleotides—and highly structured. This region of the viral genome is called internal ribosome entry site (IRES), and it directs translation of the viral RNA. Genetic mutations in this region prevent viral protein production. The first IRES to be discovered was found in poliovirus RNA.|$|E
5|$|The RNAi pathway {{is found}} in many eukaryotes, {{including}} animals, and is initiated by the enzyme Dicer, which cleaves long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules into short double-stranded fragments of ~20 nucleotide siRNAs. Each siRNA is unwound into two single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs), the passenger strand and the guide strand. The passenger strand is degraded and the guide strand is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The most well-studied outcome is post-transcriptional gene silencing, which occurs when the guide strand pairs with a complementary sequence in a <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA</b> molecule and induces cleavage by Argonaute 2 (Ago2), the catalytic component of the RISC complex. In some organisms, this process spreads systemically, despite the initially limited molar concentrations of siRNA.|$|E
5|$|The {{core of the}} exosome {{contains}} a six-membered ring structure to which other proteins are attached. In eukaryotic cells, the exosome complex {{is present in the}} cytoplasm, nucleus, and especially the nucleolus, although different proteins interact with the exosome complex in these compartments regulating the RNA degradation activity of the complex to substrates specific to these cell compartments. Substrates of the exosome include <b>messenger</b> <b>RNA,</b> ribosomal RNA, and many species of small RNAs. The exosome has an exoribonucleolytic function, meaning it degrades RNA starting at one end (the 3′ end in this case), and in eukaryotes also an endoribonucleolytic function, meaning it cleaves RNA at sites within the molecule.|$|E
40|$|Riboswitches are metabolite-responsive {{genetic control}} {{elements}} that {{reside in the}} untranslated regions (UTRs) of certain <b>messenger</b> <b>RNAs.</b> Herein, we report that the 5 ′-UTR of the lysC gene of Bacillus subtilis carries a conserved RNA element {{that serves as a}} lysine-responsive riboswitch. The ligand-binding domain of the riboswitch binds to L-lysine with an apparent dissociation constant (KD) of ∼ 1 µM, and exhibits a high level of molecular discrimination against closely related analogs, including D-lysine and ornithine. Furthermore, we provide evidence that this widespread class of riboswitches serves as a target for the antimetabolite S-(2 -aminoethyl) -L-cysteine (AEC).
