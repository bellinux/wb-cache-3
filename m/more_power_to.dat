5|$|Written by Phil Ford. A story {{planned and}} {{considered}} for the fourth series, it would have seen a new sweet shop opening near Sarah Jane's house, attracting many teenagers. Sarah, along with Rani, would have found out the Trickster was behind it all, using teenagers' souls to gain <b>more</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> destroy earth.|$|E
5|$|Some USB devices {{require more}} power than is {{permitted}} by the specifications for a single port. This is common for external hard and optical disc drives, and generally for devices with motors or lamps. Such devices can use an external power supply, which is allowed by the standard, or use a dual-input USB cable, one input of which is used for power and data transfer, the other solely for power, which makes the device a non-standard USB device. Some USB ports and external hubs can, in practice, supply <b>more</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> USB devices than required by the specification but a standard-compliant device may not depend on this.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} {{must then}} defeat the God Beasts {{before they can}} gather and destroy the world. However, after doing this they realize killing the God Beasts has given <b>more</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> their main enemy, who their personal enemies were working for—the Dragon Emperor for Duran and Angela, the Dark Prince for Hawk and Lise, and the Masked Mage for Kevin and Carlie. The already powerful villain absorbs {{the power of the}} Sword of Mana and the God Beasts in order to become a god, but is halted by the Mana Goddess blocking some of its power. After defeating the villain's minions, the characters go and defeat their main enemy, but are unable to stop him from destroying the Mana Tree and eliminating all Mana from the world. The Faerie then fuses with what is left of the Mana Tree; she will be reborn as the Mana Goddess in a thousand years, but until then Mana will not exist in the world. As the game ends, the characters go back to their homelands.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} had promulgated the Powers of Nomad Shiekhs Ordinance in 1922, and had recognized and reinforced the judicial powers of over 300 tribal leaders by 1923. They had ignored {{the aspirations of}} educated Sudanese in government employment to take {{a greater role in}} administration. The principle of indirect rule had also given the Sayyids, including Abd al-Rahman, <b>more</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> prevent changes demanded by the secular opposition. In a shift of policy, the Graduates' General Congress was launched in 1938 as a forum for the intelligentsia of Sudan to express their opinions and as an alternative voice to that of the tribal leaders, who had become discredited.|$|E
25|$|A {{year after}} its release, <b>More</b> <b>Power</b> <b>to</b> Ya {{remained}} {{one of the}} five best-selling albums in Christian music, while Never Say Die remained in the top 20 – more than two years after it hit the shelves. At the end of 1982, the two albums had sold nearly 100,000 units combined. By the next summer, <b>More</b> <b>Power</b> <b>to</b> Ya alone had topped 125,000, a total nearly unthinkable for a Christian rock album just 12 months earlier. <b>More</b> <b>Power</b> <b>to</b> Ya would not drop out of the Top 40 Christian albums until June 1985, more than two and one-half years after its debut.|$|E
25|$|Chiang {{selected}} Lee Teng-hui, a Taiwan born technocrat to be {{his vice}} president, first {{in the line of}} succession to the presidency. The move followed other reforms giving <b>more</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> native born citizens and calmed anti-KMT sentiments.|$|E

25|$|In the water, the dog's massive webbed paws give it maximum propulsion. The {{swimming}} stroke is not {{an ordinary}} dog paddle. Unlike other dogs, the Newfoundland moves its limbs in a down-and-out motion giving <b>more</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> every stroke.|$|E
25|$|Regions: At present 5 of them (Valle d'Aosta, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Trentino-Alto Adige, Sardinia and Sicily) have {{a special}} status and are given more power than the others. The {{constitutional}} reform of 2001 gave <b>more</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> regions.|$|E
25|$|In 1893–1894, GFWPTC {{constructed}} a second powerhouse just downstream of its existing south bank powerhouse.

25|$|With 1984 {{drawing to}} a close, Not of This World was deemed Christian music's fourth-best-selling album of the year, while <b>More</b> <b>Power</b> <b>to</b> Ya, {{released}} nearly two years earlier, was No.5. No other rock albums were in the top 12. Petra itself, meanwhile was listed second only to Amy Grant as Billboards Top Inspirational Artist of 1984.|$|E
25|$|In 1896, the National Bureau of Criminal Identification was founded, which {{provided}} agencies {{across the country}} with information to identify known criminals. The 1901 assassination of President William McKinley created a perception that America was under threat from anarchists. The Departments of Justice and Labor had been keeping records on anarchists for years, but President Theodore Roosevelt wanted <b>more</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> monitor them.|$|E
25|$|Reaction Force - the {{principle}} that as the striking limb is brought forward, {{other parts of the}} body should be brought backward in order to provide <b>more</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> the striking limb.

The coalition’s approach to this is to combine decentralisation with incentives for growth. ...|$|R
50|$|Due to the Local Government Act 1929, which {{transferred}} <b>more</b> <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> local authorities, a large extension {{was built}} {{to the rear of}} the University of Wales Registry to a design by Ivor Jones and Percy Thomas. This opened in 1932.|$|R

25|$|Shortly after {{recording}} Never Say Die, Petra hired Louie Weaver, previously {{a drummer}} for early Christian rock acts Randy Matthews and Fireworks. The band's touring lineup was set, and Petra {{went on the}} road for 300 days in 1982, playing 162 shows, stopping only for the five weeks it took to record the follow-up album, <b>More</b> <b>Power</b> <b>To</b> Ya, that summer.|$|E
25|$|In November 2001, Tremblay {{appointed}} Bossé as {{a member}} of the Montreal executive committee with responsibility for economic development.

25|$|In 1787, Zacharias invited all {{the leaders}} of the klephtic bands of the Peloponnese to a meeting and they formed a kleptho-armatoloi {{federation}} of the Peloponnese. This federation brought <b>more</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> Zacharias who was made the commander-in-chief of the federation. Meanwhile, he had constructed his own fortress, Barbitsa in the mountains of Mani and from there he launched his raids on the Turks. It was widely thought that Zacharias' aim was for the Turks to meet his demands, however, in reality what he wanted was the liberation of the Peloponnese from the Turks.|$|E

50|$|A {{constitutional}} referendum {{was held in}} Italy on 7 October 2001.

50|$|A {{constitutional}} referendum {{was held in}} Cameroon on 20 May 1972. The new constitution would make the country a unitary state, {{as opposed to the}} previous federal system, as well as giving <b>more</b> <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> President Ahmadou Ahidjo. It was passed by 99.99% of voters with a 98.2% turnout.|$|R
25|$|Within {{this new}} system, working Carpenters slowly lost {{the right to}} vote for their Local's Business Agents and Organizers, thus {{consolidating}} all power into the Regional Council's officers and leaving Locals and rank and file members to vote on Delegate to the intermediary Regional Councils. As the union began reorganizing its system of District Councils to give <b>more</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> Regional Councils, it consolidated Locals into fewer Charters and deprived local members of {{the right to vote}} on contract ratification, giving {{into the hands of the}} Regional Council Delegates as the contracts also expanded covering greater areas than a single Local.|$|E
25|$|The economy {{began to}} recover {{shortly after his}} term began, {{increasing}} state revenues and taking pressure of the government. A coal miners strike was still continuing when his term began, so he dispatched two commissioners to determine the problems who successfully ended the strike with promises of regulatory reform. Mount's primary concern remained to be the farming community. He advocated granting <b>more</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> the state agricultural department. Among the authority it was granted was the ability to enforce quarantines on diseased farm animals, the ability to inspect farms for disease, and promotion of fruit crops.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s, three failed {{attempts}} to remove Vargas {{and his supporters}} from power occurred. The first was the Constitutionalist Revolt in 1932 led by the Paulista oligarchy, the second was a Communist uprising in November 1935, {{and the last one}} a Putsch attempt by the local fascists in May 1938. The 1935 uprising created a security crisis in which the Congress transferred <b>more</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> the executive. The 1937 coup d'état resulted in the cancellation of the 1938 election, installed Vargas as a dictator, and began the Estado Novo era, noted for government brutality and censorship of the press.|$|E
50|$|In July, 2014, Japan {{introduced}} a reinterpretation which gave <b>more</b> <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> its Self-Defense forces, {{allowing them to}} defend other allies in case of war declared upon them.
