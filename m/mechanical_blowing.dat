40|$|The {{manufacturing}} of blown films made of {{thermoplastic materials}} {{is considered an}} important processing technique for polymer raw material. Today, one goal of the further development of the blown film extrusion is the reduction of raw material application while maintaining or {{improving the quality of}} the film, also in regard of the mechanical properties. Therefore, the mechanical film properties, as a key aspect on the way to create thinner films, move into the focus of interest. Up to now, a generic and recognised calculation model, which predicts the film properties in the blown film extrusion process, is not available. Hence, large imponderability in predicting film properties for new product development or the change of material or the production line result to the film manufacturer. Therefore, the proposal of a calculation model in order to predict the mechanical characteristic values of the blown film extrusion {{is the subject of this}} work. The model developed in the course of this work, in order to predict the blown film properties, is based on the foundation of statistical modelling. The corresponding mechanical characteristic values form the start values of the model. As input value, dimensionless process characteristic values are being chosen, in order to ensure the transferability of the statistical property model on different materials and production lines. Therefore, next to the known characteristic values of the blown film process, blow-up ratio and take-up ratio, additional process characteristic values are being introduced. All used process characteristic values have in common that they describe the process state in the bubble expansion zone because the blown film properties are being fixed there. The results show that it is on principle possible to describe the <b>mechanical</b> <b>blown</b> film properties with statistical models by the use of process characteristic values. The results of shrinkage and strain at 100 % stretch are to be judged as good, while the results of the calculation of Young’s modulus and tensile strength can be used to assess the properties roughly. The transferability of the model to different materials and blown film lines has been realised only to a limited extend. For a possible improvement, further research is necessary. Some approaches by the use of additional material- or plant-specific characteristic values have been shown already...|$|R

The exact same thing happens in power plants pipes, wherever there is a Safety Relief Valve (SRV) down the flow line, vibration will occur. This constant vibration has been identified as one of the leading causes of piping failures. The purpose of this research is to conduct a preliminary analysis to assist the prediction of the frequency at which a steam flow pipe will vibrate or resonate given a constant flow velocity, a fixed cavity or geometry, wall thickness and material. With the information obtained we can conclude that in the specific case of safety relief valves the prediction of flow induced cavity oscillation can be calculated using the following equation: = Uc / λ, Where Uc is the vortex propagation velocity and λ is the vortex wavelength. In a second phase of this research we can conduct tests with different pipe -valve configurations and measure the frequency of oscillation caused by the steam flow. Implement the use of electronic devices within the pipes, create one that can identify the frequency at which the pipe is vibrating and automatically send a pulse to cancel or eliminate the oscillation...|$|R

Methodology. The authors have performed analysis of the technological level of mining and construction works, new technique, equipment and production. One of the important issues of blasting operation is to ensure the seismic safety, acting at a distance of 30 m in the axes of single-track tunnel, as the distance to it will be 20 m from the nearest charge in the laying tunnel. This problem was solved by applying the combined blasting of blast-hole charges with delay-action and long-delay ways. Herewith the total mass of charges in the stope was divided into three groups, in which the first group is exploded by short-delay firing with, and the second one is exploded by short-delay firing too with intervals of 200 … 400 ms, the third is exploded by long-delay blasting at intervals of 500 … 10000 ms. The combined blasting of short-delay charges and delay action ones let significantly reduce seismic action at a mass explosion of charges when driving of double-track railway tunnel of a large cross-section.

40|$|This {{project was}} carried out in the {{facilities}} of Dynasol Elastomers in Gajano, Cantabria, Spain, and the main aim was to study the influence of rubber manufactured in Dynasol when they are added to prepare polyethylene films. The low-density polyethylene {{is one of the most}} demanded polymers in Europe after polypropylene. Each year, 8, 2 million tons of low density polyethylene are sold only in Europe. If these data were extrapolated for all the world, it could be 6 times greater. On the other hand, packaging (films, bags) is the area that demands the highest amount of plastics, about 40 %, and particularly, the most used polymer for packaging is low density polyethylene. For these reasons, for rubber manufacturers like Dynasol Elastomers, it is very important to know how different types of rubber (SBS, SEBS) affect low density polyethylene films. If rubber could improve the mechanical and optical properties of films, its market opportunities would greatly be expanded. In addition, it is necessary to point out that there is a lack of information about SBS or SEBS / LDPE or LLDPE blends. The literature review that {{was carried out}} revealed that there were no information published about the influence of SBS or SEBS rubber (in low percentages) in the mechanical and optical properties of low density polyethylene blown films. Therefore, to fill this gap, this work analyses the influence of three types of rubber (linear SBS, linear and decoupled SBS and linear SEBS) manufactured by Dynasol Elastomers in the properties of common low density polyethylene used in the production of blown film. To evaluate the <b>mechanical</b> properties of <b>blown</b> film produced from SBS or SEBS / LDPE or LLDPE blends, four different types of tests were carried out (percent elongation and tensile strength at break, tear strength, tensile set and sealability) following the international standards. The addition of rubber C 500 and CH 6180 X when preparing polyethylene blown film resulted in very successful values of percent elongation and tensile strength at break of 522 % and 14, 8 MPa, respectively, which clearly improved the values of pure polyethylene (290 % and 10, 4 MPa, respectively). One of the most successful and relevant results in this work is the significant decrease of tension set under constant elongation, which means a better elastic recovery. Particularly, for blown films from blends with a 10 % of rubber CH 6180 X, the recovery capacity is increased by 20 % in comparison to pure polyethylene results. To evaluate optical properties three tests were carried out (opacity, haze and gloss) following the international standards. The results reported in this work prove that the optical properties of the films are kept, which is especially noteworthy. Generally, optical properties of films are worsened in these mixing processes. However, rubber CH 6180 X and LDPE blend is able to keep and even to improve the optical properties of films, specially haze and opacity, while, at the same time, improving mechanical properties. It must be emphasized that this work can provide new market opportunities for types of rubber like CH 6180 X and, even, C 500, since this kind of rubber have improved the low-density polyethylene film mechanical properties as well as the optical properties. This fact confirms that mechanical qualities can be improved without deteriorating the optical properties by adding rubber as main component to modify low density polyethylene. These improvements can become very relevant information for any kind of packaging market, like more resistant bags for heavy stuff where a big amount of polymer is commercialized, but moreover, this can also be important for sanitary instrumentation where very strict properties are required or for specialized packaging like in the food area.

40|$|New {{technologies}} of non-lethal weapons (NLW) are under military research and development, {{mainly in the}} USA. Due to incomplete information, judgement under criteria {{of the laws of}} warfare or of human rights is hampered. This study analyses four potential NLW technologies which are based on physics to provide reliable information for such assessment. The Active Denial System (ADS) produces a beam of electromagnetic millimetre waves; such radiation is absorbed in the upper 0. 4 mm of skin. The beam stays approximately 2 m wide out to many hundreds of metres. With a power of 100 kilowatts, the beam can heat the skin of target subjects to pain-producing temperature levels within seconds. With a prototype weapon, mounted in a military multi-purpose vehicle, the effects have been tested on hundreds of volunteers. In order to produce pain while preventing burn injury, the power and duration of emission for one trigger event is controlled by a software program. Model calculations show that with the highest power setting, second- and third-degree burns with complete dermal necrosis will occur after less than 2 seconds. Even with a lower setting of power or duration there is the possibility for the operator to re-trigger immediately. Collateral damage is not much of a problem. Use in armed conflict would bring much less injury than flamethrowers which count as legitimate weapons. However, such use is not very probable because the system is large, needs to be exposed for action and is vulnerable to many kinds of light weapons. More likely is its use for internal security, by occupation forces against uprisings etc. Taking into account that the operator may be up to one km away, in such circumstances overdoses with severe burn injuries could only be prevented if technical devices would reliably limit the skin temperature, i. e., would limit beam power or duration depending on target distance and would prevent re-triggering on the same person before a certain cooling time has passed. The Advanced Tactical Laser (ATL), to be carried by a transport aircraft, is to emit an infrared laser beam of 300 kilowatts power, provided from a chemical reaction. Via a 0. 5 m wide transmitting and directing mirror, the beam can be focused – under ideal conditions – to a spot of 0. 1 - 0. 2 m size over 10 km and more. With the 100 -fold power of a stove plate applied over a similar area, wood or textiles would start burning and metal would melt through after fractions of a second, under usual atmospheric conditions on the order of one second. Strong turbulence will limit the range, fog, dust or heavy rain can reduce it markedly. With fuel for about 40 seconds of radiating on board and dwell times below a second, the beam will often be directed and fired automatically. The ATL can destroy equipment and kill people, it is not a non-lethal weapon. Its usage in armed conflict against combatants could be compared with flamethrowers which are accepted under international humanitarian law. Compared to other means of applying force at many kilometres distance (artillery, bombs), the ATL would allow much more discriminating destruction. The ATL has limitations: the fuel is sufficient only for around 100 “shots”. A clear line of sight is also needed, preventing action through fog or heavy rain and exposing the carrier aircraft. Due to its size, long range and drastic effects, the ATL is not suitable for police. In peaceenforcing operations it could allow more precise targeting than possible with artillery or guided bombs, but collateral damage is nevertheless possible to several metres from an exploding tyre, fuel tank or munition. The concept of the Pulsed Energy Projectile (PEP) is to use short, powerful, infrared laser pulses to produce a mechanical impulse. The laser works with a chemical reaction. If the pulse intensity is high enough, the uppermost target layer is explosively vaporised and the vapour heated to a plasma which absorbs the rest of the pulse and produces a lasersupported detonation wave. This shock wave exerts a mechanical impulse on the target. With a range of 0. 5 - 2 km, the PEP is to be used against humans and equipment in armed conflict and law enforcement. The ratio between impulse and laser-pulse energy is such that for a relatively high pulse energy of 1 kilojoule requiring a big, heavy laser (1 - 2 metres, hundreds of kilograms), the mechanical impulse with 0. 1 newton-second is one to two orders of magnitude below the one from a rubber baton or an existing blunt-impact munition. Multiple pulses in fast sequence would add, but then the target would be ablated to corresponding greater depth, measuring by millimetres. If bare skin were hit, bad wounds would ensue. In addition, permanent hearing damage may occur from the shock wave even from one laser pulse. If the eye is hit, serious injury by cornea ablation or mechanical impulse is probable. In clear, non-turbulent air the spot focus will remain at a few cm size out to a few kilometres, but dense fog or rain will strongly limit propagation. The PEP is a lethal weapon. It could be used selectively, without significant potential of collateral damage. Comparison with penetrating projectiles or flamethrowers shows that its use in armed conflict would not a priori contradict the rules of warfare. However, it should be investigated if severe wounds produced on bare skin, in particular to the face, and the loss of vision from eye injury may count as unnecessary suffering or superfluous injury. The PEP has limitations. It needs a clear line of sight to the target so that it will be exposed and cannot work in thick fog or rain, it will be big, heavy, complex and expensive. Due to its size, range and potential injurious effects, the PEP would neither be appropriate as a weapon for law enforcement nor for peace-enforcing operations. For <b>mechanical</b> <b>blows</b> and pain, blunt-impact projectiles provide much easier, much cheaper options with less risk of injury. The Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) was developed in a weapon programme but is now denoted as a hailing and warning device. It is a flat loudspeaker which due to its diameter of 0. 8 m has a relatively high directivity (beam opening angle 5 - 15 &# 1048689;). It transmits mainly high frequencies (above 1 kilohertz); voice messages have a range above 500 m, warning tones (1000 -fold intensity, level 30 dB higher) to above 1000 m. Since 2003, hundreds of copies have been sold to and used by mainly military forces, in particular of the USA in occupied Iraq, but police, port authorities and border patrol have also ordered the LRAD. In the high-power warning mode the sound in front of the system is at levels dangerous to unprotected hearing. In order to prevent permanent hearing damage, the exposure has to be limited to a few seconds out to 50 m distance. The LRAD has been used to expel snipers and repel pirates. For such use as a weapon, an evaluation under the laws of warfare should be done explicitly. The same holds for human-rights or constitutional law for weapon-like use by internal security forces. To prevent hearing damage, technical devices should be introduced that limit the sound power and/or duration depending on the distance to the target subject(s). The four technologies differ widely. The first three are clearly weapons, one (ADS) potentially lethal, the other two (ATL and PEP) lethal. The LRAD can be used for hailing and warning or in weapon mode. Final judgement whether introduction and use of these technologies is legally or morally justified, will strongly depend on the scenarios. Because all technologies can be problematic, continuous attention of human-rights organisations, the International Committee of the Red Cross etc. is needed. Neue Techniken nicht-tödlicher Waffen (ntW) sind in militärischer Forschung und Entwicklung, vor allem in den USA. Durch unvollständige Information wird die Beurteilung unter Kriterien des Humanitären Völkerrechts oder der Menschenrechte behindert. Diese Studie analysiert vier mögliche ntW-Techniken, die auf physikalischer Grundlage beruhen, um verlässliche Information für eine solche Beurteilung zur Verfügung zu stellen. Das Active Denial System (ADS) erzeugt einen Strahl elektromagnetischer Millimeterwellen; solche Strahlung wird in den obersten 0, 4 mm der Haut absorbiert. Der Strahl bleibt bis zu vielen hundert Meter etwa 2 m breit. Mit einer Leistung von 100 Kilowatt kann der Strahl die Haut von Zielpersonen innerhalb von Sekunden auf Schmerz erzeugende Temperaturen aufheizen. Mit einer Prototypwaffe, eingebaut in ein militärisches Mehrzweckfahrzeug, sind die Wirkungen an Hunderten von Freiwilligen erprobt worden. Damit Schmerz erzeugt wird, aber Verbrennungen vermieden werden, werden die Leistung und die Strahldauer für eine Waffenauslösung durch Software gesteuert. Modellrechnungen zeigen, dass bei der höchsten Leistungsstufe Verbrennungen zweiten und dritten Grades mit vollständiger Hautnekrose nach weniger als 2 Sekunden auftreten werden. Selbst mit einer niedrigeren Leistungsstufe oder Dauer hat der/die Bediener/in die Möglichkeit, sofort erneut auszulösen. Kollateralschaden ist kein großes Problem. Anwendung im bewaffneten Konflikt würde erheblich geringere Verletzung hervorrufen als Flammenwerfer, die als legitime Waffen zählen. Solche Nutzung ist jedoch nicht sehr wahrscheinlich, weil das System groß ist, sich zur Wirkung exponieren muss und gegen viele Arten leichter Waffen verletzlich ist. Wahrscheinlicher ist die Anwendung für innere Sicherheit, durch Besatzungsstreitkräfte gegen Aufstände usw. Wenn man in Rechnung stellt, dass der/die Bediener/in bis zu einem km entfernt sein kann, könnten Überdosierungen mit schweren Verbrennungen unter solchen Umständen nur verhindert werden, wenn ein technisches Gerät zuverlässig die Hauttempera-tur begrenzen würde, d. h. die Strahlleistung oder –dauer in Abhängigkeit von der Zielentfernung begrenzen sowie verhindern würde, dass|$|R
