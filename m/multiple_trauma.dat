40|$|Aims There is {{a growing}} body of {{evidence}} into the prevalence of Complex PTSD, however what is as of yet unclear is whether Complex PTSD is a result of <b>multiple</b> <b>traumas,</b> or a consequence of traumas occurring at a young age. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of age at first trauma and the number of traumas experienced on symptoms of Complex PTSD. Method Seventy-two individuals with PTSD were recruited from three mental health outpatient services. Participants were administered standardised measures regarding their experiences of traumatic events (THQ) and symptoms of PTSD (PCL) and Complex PTSD (DES, SDQ- 5, IIP- 25 and BDI-II). Results Age at first trauma was shown to effect interpersonal problems, with the childhood trauma group displaying increased symptoms once the number of traumas experienced was controlled for. Age at first trauma was not related to dissociation, somatisation, PTSD severity or depression. In contrast, the number of traumas experienced was related to PTSD severity, interpersonal problems, dissociation, somatisation and depression. Conclusion The results suggest that the experience of <b>multiple</b> <b>traumas</b> may lead to symptoms of Complex PTSD. With the exception of interpersonal problems, the study suggests that Complex PTSD is a response to the cumulative effect of <b>multiple</b> <b>traumas,</b> rather than a response to traumas occurring in childhood...|$|R

40|$|<b>Multiple</b> <b>traumas</b> mean {{a present}} injury {{of at least}} two body systems. The patient with the <b>multiple</b> <b>traumas</b> is, because of the {{threatening}} failure of one or more organs, alternatively systems, placed on the intensive care unit. The nursing of the patient is therefore systematic, continual and its part is the monitoring of the conditions and saturation of basic needs. The nursing care on the intensive care unit is dependent on their health conditions and it permanently changes. A nurse usually takes over the whole care of the patient and they are dependent on her. Therefore the nurse must know all the patient´s needs and provide them regard to their self-sufficiency. Self-sufficiency is the level of independence during the daily routine. To its evaluation we use Barthel test of basic daily activities. In literature the word self-care is used as an identical term. The empiric part of the bachelor thesis is focused on self-sufficiency, self-care of a patient and activation of the nurses. The goal of the research is to find out the difference in the amount of care for a patient with <b>multiple</b> <b>traumas</b> on the Intensive care unit and a standard ward in connection with the level of self-care. To fulfil the goals three research questions were set. The research questions are: How do the nurses judge the self-sufficiency of a patient with <b>multiple</b> <b>traumas</b> on the intensive care unit and a standard ward? How do they provide the nursing care at a patient with <b>multiple</b> <b>traumas</b> in a standard ward? How do they provide the nursing care at a patient with <b>multiple</b> <b>traumas</b> on the intensive care unit? The qualitative research with the help of semi-structured interview was used to answer the questions and fulfil the goals. The research was taken on the traumatologic intensive care unit and in the standard ward. 5 respondents and one patient were from the intensive care unit and other 5 respondents and two patients were from the standard ward. The answers for the first research question were identical at all respondents. The evaluation of the patient´s self-sufficiency is according to Barthel test. The answers of most respondents point at the fact that the test in not practical and suitable. The results of the second and third research question can be comprehended in one conclusion. Regarding the fact, that the nurses from the intensive care unit and the standard ward made comments in the same way. The nursing care is always provided regarding the self-sufficiency of a patient. They support a patient mentally to make him more self-independent. They use different accessible tools for practice. With the help of the research questions we reached the goals. We found out that the difference in the extent of provided care is in the amount of activities which are done by nurses for the patient on the intensive care unit and in the standard ward. The nurses provide a patient with more activities logically on the intensive care unit. It is due to the conditions of a patient which are acute at the beginning. Even though, the nurses try to activate a patient as much as possible. By contrast, the nurses in a standard ward have the chance to increase patient´s self-sufficiency in more activities. They endeavour patients to be self-sufficient in hygiene, catering, walking and excretion. In these activities patients should be helped by physiotherapists. As it is agreed by the nurses from the intensive care unit as well as the nurses from the standard ward, this approach does not really work and so the only ones who activate a patient are the nurses and hospital attendants. The work should serve the nurses to clarify the importance of <b>multiple</b> <b>traumas</b> and deepen their knowledge of discussed problems...|$|R

Phosphorus intakes were recorded for 14 {{days from the}} initiation of tube feeding which was started 1 to 3 days post-injury. Serum for determination of phosphorus concentrations was collected at days 1, 3, 7, and 14 of the study period. A 24 -hour urine collection was obtained during {{the first and second}} weeks of nutrition support for urinary phosphorus excretion, fractional excretion of phosphorus, renal threshold phosphate concentration, and phosphorus clearance. Average total daily phosphorus intake during the 14 -day study for thermally injured patients and <b>multiple</b> <b>trauma</b> patients was 0. 99 ± 0. 26 mmol/kg/d vs 0. 58 ± 0. 21 mmol/kg/d, respectively, p 3 ̆c. 001. Serum phosphorus concentration on the third day of observation was significantly lower in the thermally injured group than those with <b>multiple</b> <b>trauma</b> (1. 9 ± 0. 8 mg/dL vs 3. 0 ± 0. 8 mg/dL, p ≤. 01). A trend toward hypophosphatemia in the thermally injured group persisted by the seventh day of feeding (2. 7 ± 1. 2 mg/dL vs 3. 3 ± 0. 6 mg/dL, p ≤. 04). Differences in urinary phosphorus excretion was not statistically significant between the thermally injured and <b>multiple</b> <b>trauma</b> groups (271 ± 213 mg/d vs 171 ± 181 mg/d for week 1, and 320 ± 289 mg/d vs 258 ± 184 mg/d for week 2, respectively). Urinary phosphorus clearance, fractional excretion of phosphorus, or renal threshold phosphate concentrations were also not significantly different between thermally injured and <b>multiple</b> <b>trauma</b> patients. During nutrition support, serum phosphorus concentrations are lower in thermally injured patients compared with <b>multiple</b> <b>trauma</b> patients despite receiving a significantly greater intake of phosphorus.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the association between different types of child maltreatment and the presence of psychiatric disorders in highly vulnerable children and adolescents served by a multidisciplinary program. METHODS: In total, 351 patients with a mean age of 12. 47, of whom 68. 7 % were male and 82. 1 % lived in shelters, underwent psychiatric evaluations based on the Kiddie-Sads-Present and Lifetime Version. Two different methods were used to evaluate maltreatment: medical records were reviewed to identify previous diagnoses related to socioeconomic and psychosocial circumstances, and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire was used to obtain a structured history of trauma. Bivariate associations were evaluated between psychiatric disorders and evidence of each type and the frequency of abuse. RESULTS: The most frequent psychiatric diagnoses were substance use disorders, affective disorders and specific disorders of early childhood, whereas 13. 67 % of the sample had no psychiatric diagnosis. All patients suffered neglect, and 58. 4 % experienced physical or sexual abuse. The presence of a history of <b>multiple</b> <b>traumas</b> was only associated with a diagnosis of substance use disorder.

40|$|Background: Different trauma {{characteristics}} {{have been}} suggested to lead to distinct symptom profiles. This study investigates the effect of two trauma characteristics, age of onset and frequency, on PTSD symptom profiles. Methods: Trauma characteristics (childhood versus adulthood trauma and single versus <b>multiple</b> <b>trauma),</b> psychiatric diagnosis, PTSD severity, depressive symptoms, dissociation, guilt, shame, anger, and interpersonal sensitivity were assessed in 110 PTSD outpatients. Results: Single versus <b>multiple</b> <b>trauma</b> and childhood versus adulthood trauma {{groups did not differ}} in depressive symptom and co-morbidity. <b>Multiple</b> <b>trauma</b> patients reported more dissociation, guilt, shame, and interpersonal sensitivity than those that experienced single trauma. Anger of <b>multiple</b> <b>trauma</b> patients was more often directed towards themselves, whereas anger in single trauma patients was more often directed towards others. Childhood trauma patients reported more dissociation and state anger than adulthood trauma patients. However, with the exception of <b>multiple</b> <b>trauma</b> patients having more dissociation and shame than those with single trauma, all differences disappeared after controlling for PTSD severity. Limitations: This study is a first step in unraveling the impact of different trauma characteristics. Causal inferences are limited, though, because of the cross-sectional design. Conclusions: The results suggest that experiencing trauma at young age or multiple times may lead to different symptom profiles but these are, with the exception of dissociation and shame, dependent on PTSD severity. These results support the proposed DSM-V criteria in which these symptoms appear as part of the disorder, and stress the importance of early treatment...|$|E
