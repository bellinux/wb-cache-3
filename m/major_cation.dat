50|$|There are two {{different}} types of fluid that surround the hair cells of the inner ear. The endolymph is the fluid that surrounds the apical surfaces of hair cells. Potassium is the <b>major</b> <b>cation</b> in the endolymph and is thought to be responsible for carrying the receptor currents in the cochlea. Perilymph is found surrounding the sides and the bases of the hair cells. Perilymph is low in potassium and high in sodium. The different ionic makeups of the surrounding fluid in addition to the resting potential of the hair cell creates a potential difference across the apical membrane of the hair cell, so potassium enters when transduction channels open. An influx of potassium ions depolarizes the cell and causes the release of a neurotransmitter that can initiate nerve impulses in the sensory neurons that synapse on the base of the hair cell.|$|E
40|$|Compared {{with the}} {{extensively}} surveyed temperate and boreal peatlands, subtropical peatlands have received rather little scientific attention. In this study, spatial variations in water chemistry were investigated in 57 samples collected from three subtropical peatlands (central China). Generally, water pH and <b>major</b> <b>cation</b> concentrations of these samples approached {{the characteristics of}} poor fens along the bog–rich fen gradient. Four distinct groups were identified by cluster analysis and principal component analysis. High concentrations of trace elements in Group I were probably linked to airborne dust pollutants from a nearby road under construction. Low pH values and low <b>major</b> <b>cation</b> concentrations in Group II {{may be attributed to}} the great cation exchange capacity of Sphagnum. In contrast, samples in Group III, mainly collected from sites suffering from Sphagnum harvest, showed high pH levels and <b>major</b> <b>cation</b> concentrations. Relatively low concentrations of trace elements (except boron) in Group IV can be regarded as reference conditions for restoration efforts in these peatlands. Taken together, spatial variations in the water chemistry of the three peatlands were closely linked to natural processes (e. g., cation exchange of Sphagnum) and anthropogenic pressures (e. g., Sphagnum harvest). Overall, the mean health risk values of the six trace elements were low, indicating good water quality in these peatlands.
