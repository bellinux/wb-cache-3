40|$|Bei manchen Untersuchungen während der Schwangerschaft liefert alleinig die MRT die erforderliche Information für die anstehende Therapieplanung. So ist sie zum Beispiel zur Beurteilung der Plazenta und zur Abklärung abdomineller oder cerebraler Beschwerden eine große Hilfe und oft unverzichtbar. Auch pelvine Erkrankungen lassen sich mittels MRT exzellent darstellen. Bei einigen Untersuchungen ist eine native MRT nicht ausreichend, so dass paramagnetische Kontrastmittel appliziert werden müssen. Die intravenös verabreichten Kontrastmittel sind plazentagängig und gelangen so auch in den fetalen Kreislauf. Über die Wirkung dieser Kontrastmittel auf das Ungeborene ist bisher nur sehr wenig bekannt und somit Anlass für diese Studie. Untersucht wird die Wirkung von den zwei gadoliniumhaltigen Kontrastmittel Omniscan® und MultiHance® und der manganhaltigen Verbindung Teslascan® in der umgerechnet maximal erlaubten Dosis und dem Fünf-, Zehn- und Zwanzigfachen dieser Dosis. Es wird mit humanen embryonalen Lungenfibroblasten (Hel) und humanen Endothelzellen aus der Nabelschnur (Huvec) gearbeitet. Die Zellen werden 4 bzw. 24 mit den {{genannten}} Kontrastmitteln inkubiert und dann hinsichtlich ihrer klonogenen Aktivität (Koloniebildungsassay) und ihren Proliferationsfähigkeit (Proliferationskinetik) untersucht. Proliferationskinetik Lungenfibroblasten:	 Statistisch signifikant unterschiedlich zur Kontrolle ist nur Teslascan® in zehnfacher Dosis. Im Gegensatz zu den Kontrastmitteln MultiHance® und Omniscan® hat Teslascan® eine hemmende Wirkung auf die Proliferationskinetik der Lungenfibroblasten. Proliferationskinetik Nabelschnurzellen:	 Hier zeigt keines der drei Kontrastmittel hemmende Effekte auf das Wachstum der Zellen. Koloniebildungsassay Lungenfibroblasten:					 Nach Inkubation mit MultiHance® in zwanzigfacher Dosis lässt sich eine statistisch signifikant reduzierte Koloniebildungsfähigkeit beobachten. Ebenso nach Inkubation der Zellen mit Teslascan® in fünffacher Dosis. Koloniebildungsassay Nabelschnurendothelzellen: Nach Inkubation mit Omniscan® in zwanzigfacher Dosis kommt es zu einer statistisch signifikant niedrigeren Koloniezahl. Ebenso nach Inkubation der Zellen mit Teslascan® sowohl in zehn- als auch in zwanzigfacher Konzentration. Da bisher nur sehr wenige Studien zu dieser Problematik vorliegen und die Ergebnisse in bisherigen sowie in der vorliegenden Studie nicht eindeutig und zum Teil widersprüchlich sind, können keine definitiven Aussagen über die Toxizität von MRT-Kontrastmitteln für den Fetus gemacht werden. So sind auf diesem Gebiet weitere Untersuchungen und Studien notwendig, um Klarheit zu schaffen. Bis dahin wird eine strenge Indikationsstellung zu stellen und die geringstmögliche Dosis des zum Einsatz kommenden Kontrastmittels zu wählen. Die vorliegende Studie zeigt, dass die untersuchten Kontrastmittel in der klinisch verwendeten Dosis keine toxischen Effekte haben. Weiterhin zeigt sich eine Zellabhängigkeit. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass eine MRT-Untersuchung in der Schwangerschaft durchaus durchführbar ist. In {{some tests}} during pregnancy, only an MRI provides the necessary information for subsequent therapeutic planning. Thus, an MRI {{is a great}} help and often indispensable, for example, in assessing the placenta and identifying abdominal or cerebral issues. Pelvic disease can also be excellently represented using MRI. For some tests, a native MRI is not sufficient, making the application of paramagnetic contrast agents necessary. The intravenously administered contrast agents cross the placenta and consequently also reach fetal circulation. Thus far, very {{little is known about}} the effects of these contrast agents on the fetus, which gives rise to the occasion for this study. The subject of the study is the effect of the two gadolinium-based contrast agents Omniscan® and MultiHance® and the manganese-based compound Teslascan® in the <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> and multiples of five, ten and twenty times this dose. Work was performed using human embryonic lung fibroblasts (Hel) and human endothelial cells from the umbilical cord (Huvec). The cells were incubated for 4 or 24 [hours] with the aforementioned contrast agents and then examined for their clonogenic activity (colony formation assay) and their ability to proliferate (proliferation kinetics). Proliferation kinetics of lung fibroblasts:	 Only Teslascan® in the tenfold dose exhibited a statistically significantly difference from the control. Unlike the contrast agents MultiHance® and Omniscan®, Teslascan® has an inhibitory effect on the proliferation kinetics of the lung fibroblasts. Proliferation kinetics of umbilical cord cells:	 Here, none of the three contrast agents demonstrated inhibitory effects on the growth of the cells. Colony formation assay of lung fibroblasts:					 After incubation with MultiHance® at a twenty-fold dose, a statistically significantly reduced colony-forming ability was able to be observed. The same held true after incubation of the cells with Teslascan® at a fivefold dose. Colony formation assay of umbilical cord endothelial cells: After incubation with Omniscan® at a twenty-fold dose, a statistically significantly lower number of colonies resulted. This was also the case after incubation of the cells with Teslascan® at both ten and twenty times the concentration. Since only very few studies have been completed on this issue and the results in previous studies as well as in the present one are ambiguous and sometimes contradictory, no definitive statements about the toxicity of MRI contrast agents for the fetus can be made. Consequently, additional research and studies are required in this field to clarify the issue. Until then, a strict diagnosis is recommended along with selecting the lowest possible dose of the contrast agent to be used. The present study shows that the contrast agents that were studied have no toxic effects in the clinically used dose. A cell dependency is additionally indicated. The results show that an MRI scan during pregnancy is quite feasible...|$|E

Conditions were chosen that would maximize exposure to the $sup 239 $Pu in the sludge through resuspension and in plant content and thus approximated the maximum potential hazards due to the inhalation and ingestion pathways. The estimated 50 -year radiation doses to the pulmonary region of the lung, bone, and liver based on the results of the inhalation experiment are 6 x 10 $sup - 4 $ rem, 1. 2 x 10 $sup - 3 $ rem, and 0. 55 x 10 $sup - 4 $ rem, respectively. Similarly, the 50 - year radiation doses attributable to ingestion of the sludge-grown vegetables were 2. 2 x 10 $sup - 5 $ rem to the bone and 1. 5 x 10 $sup - 5 $ rem to the liver. Thus, the inhalation pathway is the more critical of the two.

A new formula is described that is sufficiently general not to require future modification in principle and which incorporates recent data on estuarine dilution and concentration factors for nuclides in oysters, and which is based on current 1 CRP recommendations and N. S. W. State Regulations concerning <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> <b>doses</b> applicable to members of the general public. Discharges are limited so that population exposures resulting from the ingestion of contaminated oysters, from sunbathing on sands near the discharge point, and from the incorporation of contaminated sand in cuts are kept within acceptable limits; it also ensures that people who daily handle large quantitiesof oysters will not be subjected to unacceptable levels of irradiation. Values for <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> monthly discharge (m. p. m. d.) for 173 nuclides have been calculated and tabulated. For mixtures of these nuclides the formula is: where XI is the quantity of the ith nuclide released and V gallons is the monthly volume of liquid discharged or 3 x 106 gallons, whichever is the smaller...|$|R
40|$|Exposure {{to natural}} sources of radiation, {{especially}} 222 Rn and its short-lived daughter products {{has become an}} important issue throughout the world because sustained exposure of humans to indoor radon may cause lung cancer. The indoor radon concentration level and radon effective dose rate were {{carried out in the}} dwellings of Medani, El Hosh, Elmanagil, Haj Abd Allah, and Wad Almahi cities, Gezira State - Central Sudan, in 393 measurements, using passive integrated solid-state nuclear track devices containing allyl diglycol carbonate plastic detectors. The radon concentration in the corresponding dwellings was found to vary from (57 ± 8) Bq/m 3 in Medani to 41 ± 9 Bq/m 3 in Wad Almahi, with an average of 49 ± 10 Bq/m 3. Assuming an indoor occupancy factor of 0. 8 and 0. 4 for the equilibrium factor of radon indoors, we found that the annual effective dose rate from 222 Rn in the studied dwellings ranges from 1. 05 to 1. 43 mSv per year and the relative lung cancer risk for radon exposure was 1. 044 %. In this research, we also correlated the relationship of radon concentration and building age. From our study, {{it is clear that the}} annual effective dose rate is larger than the “normal” background level as quoted by UNSCEAR, lower than the recommended action level of ICRP, and less than the <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> <b>dose</b> defined by the International Atomic Energy Agency...|$|R
40|$|Background/Objective: Nowadays, {{radiation}} {{is widely used}} in the diagnosis of many diseases, but hazards of radiation are an important limitation {{in the use of}} radiation for medical purposes. Awareness of radiation doses received by patients in different radiological examinations is the main step of patients' radiation protection. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the level of doctor's knowledge about radiation doses received by patients in radiological examinations. "nPatients and Methods: A questionnaire was compiled and the most commonly requested radiological investigations were listed. Participants were asked to identify the average dose of radiation received by patients when they underwent a posterior-anterior hand x-ray. This was then utilized to represent a single dose of radiation, and doctors were asked to estimate the <b>equivalent</b> <b>doses</b> of radiation for other radiological examinations. The correct answers were derived from other related studies and text books. The questionnaire also had some questions about dose measurement units and low exposure risk investigations. We asked a convenience sample of 155 physicians. About 77 % of the participants answered the questions completely. "nResults: The results indicated that only 58. 3 % of the doctors know the units of radiation absorb dose measurement units. Most of the doctors could not correctly estimate the amount of the radiation dose received by patients in a routine radiography of the hand and were not aware of the annual <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> <b>dose</b> for the general public. Some of the doctors did not know that sonography and MRI have no radiation dose. The majority of them under estimated the radiation dose received by patients in radiological examinations. "nConclusion: It does seem that most doctors have no idea of the amount of radiation received by patients undergoing commonly requested investigations, despite the fact that they have all passed the medical physics course...|$|R
5|$|Plutonium, when {{entering}} the body through air, food or blood (e.g. a wound), mostly settles in the lungs, liver and bones with only about 10% going to other organs, and remains there for decades. The long residence time of plutonium {{in the body}} is partly explained by its poor solubility in water. Some isotopes of plutonium emit ionizing α-radiation, which damages the surrounding cells. The median lethal dose (LD50) for 30 days in dogs after intravenous injection of plutonium is 0.32 milligram per kg of body mass, and thus the lethal dose for humans is approximately 22mg for a person weighing 70kg; the amount for respiratory exposure should be approximately four times greater. Another estimate assumes that plutonium is 50 times less toxic than radium, and thus permissible content of plutonium in the body should be 5µg or 0.3 µCi. Such amount is nearly invisible in under microscope. After trials on animals, this <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> <b>dose</b> was reduced to 0.65µg or 0.04 µCi. Studies on animals also revealed that the most dangerous plutonium exposure route is through inhalation, after which 5–25% of inhaled substances is retained in the body. Depending on the particle size and solubility of the plutonium compounds, plutonium is localized either in the lungs or in the lymphatic system, or is absorbed in the blood and then transported to the liver and bones. Contamination via food is the least likely way. In this case, only about 0.05% of soluble 0.01% insoluble compounds of plutonium absorbs into blood, {{and the rest is}} excreted. Exposure of damaged skin to plutonium would retain nearly 100% of it.|$|R
