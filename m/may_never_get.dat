500|$|Because Johnston was {{believed}} to be safe at the ColdwaterII observation post, the fact that he died shocked his friends and co-workers alike. However, most of his colleagues and family asserted that Johnston died [...] "doing what he wanted to do." [...] His mother stated in an interview shortly after the eruption, [...] "Not many people get to do what they really want to do in this world, but our son did.... He would tell us he <b>may</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> rich but he was doing what he wanted. He wanted to be near if the eruption came. In a phone call on Mother's Day, he told us it's a sight very few geologists get to see."

Collins, Cash, and Norman {{were unable to}} discern if {{the power of the}} song came from the music or the lyrics. Norman, who once notably sang it {{at the end of a}} large outdoor rock concert for Nelson Mandela's 70th birthday, stated, [...] "I don't know whether it's the text I don't know whether we're talking about the lyrics when we say that it touches so many people or whether it's that tune that everybody knows." [...] A prisoner interviewed by Moyers explained his literal interpretation of the second verse: [...] "'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears relieved" [...] by saying that the fear became immediately real to him when he realized he <b>may</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> his life in order, compounded by the loneliness and restriction in prison. Gospel singer Marion Williams summed up its effect: [...] "That's a song that gets to everybody".|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} 2009, xx had {{appeared}} on several critics' lists of the year's best albums. It was ranked second by NME, sixth by Uncut, third by Pitchfork, ninth by Rolling Stone, and fourth by Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot. The Guardian named it the year's best record in their annual critics poll and Tim Jonze, the newspaper's editor, hailed it as not only [...] "the sound of 2009, [...] a distinctive musical statement of the like we <b>may</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> to hear again". It also finished seventh in The Village Voices Pazz & Jop poll of American critics and third in HMV's Poll of Polls, an annual list compiled by British music retailer HMV and collated from best-album nominations made by journalists in the English and Irish music press. In decade-end lists of the greatest records from the 2000s, The Sunday Times and its sister paper, The Times, ranked xx seventy-seventh and thirtieth, respectively. The record was {{also included in the}} 2010 edition of Robert Dimery's music reference book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. In September of that year, xx won the Mercury Prize, an annual award given to the best album from the UK and Ireland. Before the nominations shortlist had been announced, bookmakers and critics considered the xx as favorites and predicted they would win over the more high-profile artists Corinne Bailey Rae, Paul Weller, and Dizzee Rascal. McCormick, one of the critics who predicted its victory, explained that it [...] "seemed the record that most represented Britain" [...] with its charmingly intimate style and unique take on modern pop tastes.|$|E
500|$|Lieutenant Halvorsen's {{role in the}} Berlin Airlift was to fly one of many C-54 cargo planes used {{to ferry}} {{supplies}} into the starving city. During his flights he would first fly to Berlin, then deeper into Soviet-controlled areas. Halverson {{had an interest in}} photography and on his days off often went sightseeing in Berlin and shot film on his personal handheld movie camera. One day in July, he was filming plane takeoffs and landings at Tempelhof, the main landing site for the airlift. While there, he saw about thirty children lined up behind one of the barbed-wire fences. He went to meet them and noticed that the children had nothing. Halvorsen remembers: [...] "I met about thirty children at the barbed wire fence that protected Tempelhof's huge area. They were excited and told me that 'when the weather gets so bad that you can't land, don't worry about us. We can get by on a little food, but if we lose our freedom, we <b>may</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> it back.'" [...] Touched, Halvorsen reached into his pocket and took out two sticks of gum to give to the children. The kids broke it into little pieces and shared it; the ones who did not get any sniffed the wrappers. Watching the children, so many of whom had absolutely nothing, Halvorsen regretted not having more to give them. Halvorsen recorded that he wanted to do more for the children, and so told them that the following day he would have enough gum for all of them, and he would drop it out of his plane. According to Halvorsen, one child asked [...] "How will we know it is your plane?" [...] to which Halvorsen responded that he would wiggle his wings, something he had done for his parents when he first got his pilot's license in 1941.|$|E

Nevertheless, the single reached the top 20, peaking at number 16, but it was well below expectations, and this set in motion the changes that were to take place in his career, including a new hairstyle, changing from the slicked-back pompadour style to the curlier style he would keep the rest of his life. However, Twitty's popularity and momentum were unaffected by the song, as his next 23 consecutive singles all made it into the top 10, with 13 peaking at number 1, including [...] "Don't Take It Away", [...] "I <b>May</b> <b>Never</b> <b>Get</b> to Heaven", [...] "Happy Birthday Darlin'" [...] and remakes of major pop hits such as [...] "The Rose" [...] and [...] "Slow Hand".|$|E
2500|$|What I am {{concerned}} about is the trend, common among present-day Buddhist teachers, of recasting the core principles of the Buddha's teachings into largely psychological terms and then saying, [...] "This is Dhamma." [...] When this is done we <b>may</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> {{to see that the}} real purpose of the teaching, in its own framework, is not to induce [...] "healing" [...] or [...] "wholeness" [...] or [...] "self-acceptance," [...] but to propel the mind in the direction of deliverance – and to do so by attenuating, and finally extricating, all those mental factors responsible for our bondage and suffering. We should remember that the Buddha did not teach the Dhamma as an [...] "art of living" [...] – though it includes that – but above all as a path to deliverance, a path to final liberation and enlightenment. And what the Buddha means by enlightenment is not a celebration of the limitations of the human condition, not a passive submission to our frailties, but an overcoming of those limitations by making a radical, revolutionary breakthrough to an altogether different dimension of being.|$|E

Udugampola spent time at Nunawading Aquatic Club in Melbourne to help prepare her for the Games. Prior to leaving for the Games, she said to the press about her excitement over taking part in London and called it [...] "a one in a lifetime chance and we <b>may</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> it again": [...] "London is going to be something different. I’ve been training in Australia and I’m aiming for a national record, I don’t know if I will get it but I’m going to focus on that.” Udugampola participated in event's second heat on 1 August, finishing sixth out of seven athletes, with a time of one minute and 4.93 seconds. She finished in front of Magdalena Moshi of Tanzania (one minute and 5.80 seconds) but behind Madagascar's Aina Fils Rabetsara (one minute and 2.39 seconds) in a heat led by Jade Ashleigh Howard of Zambia (59.35 seconds).

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of the YTA Program is that students, working with Tri-C instructors, NASA engineers, and technicians, begin to build relationships with professionals with whom they might not normally have contact. These professionals serve as role models for students and help them to apply math, science and problem-solving skills in real time to construct a competition-ready robot, allowing them to experience the satisfaction and challenges of an engineering or technical career by working diligently to solve problems that <b>may</b> <b>never</b> have been thought possible to solve. Transcending school boundaries, YTA is available to all students who are interested and qualified but who <b>may</b> otherwise <b>never</b> <b>get</b> an opportunity to participate because their school does not offer a robotics program. YTA fills an educational void by offering an exciting engineering and technology experience to a greater number of students than have been able to participate in the past. Our students have been working hard and see the long-term rewards for their efforts. The YTA Team 1270 was a finalist at the 2005 FIRST Robotics Florida Regional and took home second- place honors. Mark Poljak, nominated by the students of YTA Team 1270, received the Woodie Flowers Award at the FIRST 2005 Buckeye Regional competition. This award celebrates effective communication in the art and science of engineering and design. The YTA Team was also invited, as one of fifty-four teams, to participate in this year s FIRST VEX Robotics tournament representing Cuyahoga Community College and NASA GRC (Team 26), held at the FIRST Robotics National Competition in Atlanta, GA.

2500|$|We weren't {{trying not}} {{to put out a}} record. It was just one thing after another and time flew by. When you don't do your band like a career like us, you've got other things to do than worry about getting records made. If you don't put a {{deadline}} on it, it <b>may</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> done. Like us, you turn around and it's been six years. The first year or two after the last record, we were still touring and not thinking about making an album. Then, in the third year, we were busy and it took a few months to write and get in the studio. There's lag time at the label and then it's winter... It just goes on and on. When NOFX asked us if we wanted to go on the road with them, {{we thought it would be}} fun, but we thought it would be better if we had the record finished. We hadn't planned on being done in October. It was for later in the year, so we had to kick it in high gear and get into the studio. Everything worked backwards from there 'cause if we had fucked it up, we'd be looking at 2009 before the album was done. That deadline really got it all together, but it was only a matter of a few weeks. We'd planned to go into the studio three weeks after we actually did. We'd have only rehearsed with the luxury time, so we were ready. Most of [...] the last 12 months, so it's a new record, not stuff we were sitting on and hadn't recorded. It's also not like we were writing these songs for the last six years. Once we were ready, it came together surprisingly quickly, and I think people will be kind of shocked but happy with the results.|$|E
2500|$|On 18 August 2009, Viswa Sadasivan moved {{a motion}} for Parliament to reaffirm [...] "its {{commitment}} to the nation building tenets as enshrined in the National Pledge when debating national policies, especially economic policies". He identified one of the tenets of the Pledge as the need to strive to become a [...] "united people, regardless of race, language or religion", and expressed the view that Singaporean society needed to address [...] "apparent contradictions and mixed signals" [...] by unnecessarily emphasizing racial differences. He gave examples where this had occurred: the existence of ethnic based self-help groups, Special Assistance Plan schools and cultural elitism; policies concerning Malay-Muslims in the Singapore Armed Forces and maintaining the current racial distribution in the population; and discussions about whether Singapore was ready for an ethnic minority Prime Minister. The next day, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew refuted what he termed Viswa's [...] "false and flawed" [...] arguments, saying he wanted to [...] "bring the House back to earth" [...] {{on the issue of}} racial equality in Singapore. He noted that Articles 152 and 153 of the Constitution, which make it the Government's responsibility to care for racial and religious minorities and to recognize the special position of Malays as the indigenous people of Singapore, explicitly impose a duty on the Government not to treat everyone equally. He felt that the tenet in the Pledge that Viswa had referred to was only an aspiration: [...] "It is not reality, it is not practical, it will lead to grave and irreparable damage if we work on that principle. ... e are trying to reach a position where there is a level playing field for everybody which is going to take decades, if not centuries, and we <b>may</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> there." [...] Thus, it was not feasible to dismantle institutions that provided assistance to Singaporeans on an ethnic basis. It was the first time since 2007 that Lee had chosen to speak during a debate in Parliament.|$|E
