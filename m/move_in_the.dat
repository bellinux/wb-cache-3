5|$|An {{example of}} this is the {{psychology}} of perception. Scientists working in this field have discovered general principles of the perception of forms. A law of the psychology of forms says that objects that <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same direction are perceived as related to each other. This law describes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states. However, it does not suggest anything about the nature of perceptual states. The laws discovered by psychology are compatible with all the answers to the mind–body problem already described.|$|E

5|$|Dragon Quest II is a {{role-playing}} video game. It {{allows the}} player to control {{more than one}} character, each of whom has their own characteristics, {{and it is the}} first game in the Dragon Quest series to do so. The game introduced a party system where, instead of beginning the game with an entire party as was common in previous computer RPGs, the player begins the game with only one character and gradually recruits more party members {{during the course of the}} game. The player controls his or her characters as they <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game world. They can search treasure chests, talk and trade with villagers, equip themselves with weapons and armor, and cast spells.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{characters}} from other games were meant {{to have some of}} their moves changed or removed in order to balance them with KOF's new characters. However, designers focused in adjusting the imbalance of certain characters without removing any <b>move.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> end, creators of the series noted that the Art of Fighting characters were the strongest ones in the game. Nevertheless, other characters such as Terry and Andy Bogard became the ones who got the designers' utmost attention and were given new moves.|$|E

5|$|The {{existence}} of Mars as a wandering {{object in the}} night sky was recorded by ancient Egyptian astronomers. By the 2nd millennium BCE they were familiar with the apparent retrograde motion of the planet, in which it appears to <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposite direction across the sky from its normal progression. Mars was portrayed on the ceiling of the tomb of Seti I, on the Ramesseum ceiling, and in the Senenmut star map. The last is the oldest known star map, being dated to 1534 BCE based on the position of the planets.|$|E

5|$|The worm {{starts at}} some point of an {{infinite}} triangular grid. It starts moving along {{one of the six}} gridlines that meet at each point and, once it has travelled one unit of distance, it arrives at a new point. The worm then decides, based on the distribution of traversed and untraversed gridlines, what direction it will take. The directions are relative to the worm's point of view. If the worm has not encountered this exact distribution before it may leave along any untraversed gridline. From then on, if it encounters that distribution again, it must <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same way. If there are no untraversed gridlines available, the worm dies and the simulation ends.|$|E
5|$|A {{week after}} the Gent–Wevelgem, Cancellara raced the Tour of Flanders. On the {{penultimate}} climb of the day, the Oude Kwaremont, Cancellara attacked and only Sep Vanmarcke was able to mark his move. The pair traveled along the course and caught the leaders {{on the road and}} the group of four then rode into the finish together. Cancellara out-sprinted the three other riders to win his third edition of the Tour of Flanders. Three days later, Cancellara raced in the Scheldeprijs. Four days following the Scheldeprijs, Cancellara began the Paris-Roubaix. He made a <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Carrefour de l'Arbre sector and which {{led to the formation of}} a lead group. The group came to the line twenty seconds after the winner, with Cancellara managing to sprint to a third-place finish.|$|E
5|$|By 5 May 1536, {{the town}} council of Buena Esperanza had now lost all faith in Cerezeda and {{voted for the}} {{abandonment}} of Higueras {{and a return to}} Trujillo; Cerezeda opposed this decision, but the council forced him to sign off on the <b>move.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> meantime, any party foraging outside of Buena Esperanza was ordered to consist of at least 20 members for defence from the hostile natives. A chaotic evacuation back to Trujillo began, and resentment against Cerezeda was such that he feared for his life and fled to Naco to seek refuge amongst friendly natives there. On 9 May, amidst this disordered Spanish retreat, García de Celís returned from Guatemala with news that help would soon be forthcoming.|$|E

5|$|In 1535, the abbey's {{income was}} only {{assessed}} at £155 in the Valor Ecclesiasticus, Henry VIII's great survey of church finances. It meant {{the following year}} that it came {{under the terms of}} the first Suppression Act, Henry's initial <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dissolution of the Monasteries. Abbot William Dovell and his 16monks were forced to surrender the abbey on 6 September 1536. There were proposals from local gentry and even some of the king's officials for the Dissolution such as Sir Thomas Arundell that Cleeve should be granted a reprieve, as a number of others among the smaller monasteries were, however, it was not to be and the monks finally left in the spring of 1537. Abbot William was given a pension of 40marks per year, not large but certainly comfortable, which he was still drawing 20years later. Most of the other monks were given pensions too. One former monk of Cleeve rose to prominence and came to a sticky end. This was John Hooper who became Bishop of Gloucester and Worcester and was killed in 1555 for his Protestant beliefs by Mary I.|$|E
5|$|King Henry died on 6 July 1189 {{and his son}} Richard I was crowned on 3 September. The {{succession}} of a new monarch eventually allowed a truce in the dispute between the Canterbury monks and their archbishop, as Henry had been {{a supporter of the}} archbishop's scheme. Before the truce could be hammered out, Baldwin appointed Norreis as prior of Christ Church in October 1189 as another <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> quarrel over the Hackington project. In November the cathedral chapter secured a compromise that included the abandonment of the scheme and Norreis's dismissal from office. The agreement came at a council held by Richard in late November 1189 at which the monks agreed to let the king settle the dispute over the Hackington project if the archbishop would withdraw Norreis' appointment. Norreis's fellow monks considered him a traitor to their cause, and his reputation was that of someone with few morals. He was also known for ingratiating himself with those in power, including the justiciar Geoffrey fitzPeter. Many of the details concerning Norreis' career at Christ Church come from the works of Gervase of Canterbury, as well as the collection of letters known as the Epistolae Cantuarienses.|$|E
5|$|McClintock {{was widely}} {{credited}} with discovering transposition after other researchers finally discovered {{the process in}} bacteria, yeast, and bacteriophages in the late 1960s and early 1970s. During this period, molecular biology had developed significant new technology, and scientists were able to show the molecular basis for transposition. In the 1970s, Ac and Ds were cloned by other scientists and were shown to be Class II transposons. Ac is a complete transposon that can produce a functional transposase, which {{is required for the}} element to move within the genome. Ds has a mutation in its transposase gene, which means that it cannot move without another source of transposase. Thus, as McClintock observed, Ds cannot <b>move</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absence of Ac. Spm has also been characterized as a transposon. Subsequent research has shown that transposons typically do not move unless the cell is placed under stress, such as by irradiation or the breakage-fusion-bridge cycle, and thus their activation during stress can serve as a source of genetic variation for evolution. McClintock understood the role of transposons in evolution and genome change well before other researchers grasped the concept. Nowadays, Ac/Ds is used as a tool in plant biology to generate mutant plants used for the characterization of gene function.|$|E
