5|$|Females become {{sexually mature}} at around {{three or four}} years of age and males at around five; however, males often do not {{successfully}} breed until a few years later. A captive male sired offspring at age 19. In the wild, sea otters live to a <b>maximum</b> <b>age</b> of 23 years, with average lifespans of 10–15 years for males and 15–20 years for females. Several captive individuals have lived past 20 years, and a female at the Seattle Aquarium {{died at the age of}} 28 years. Sea otters in the wild often develop worn teeth, which may account for their apparently shorter lifespans.|$|E
5|$|In a Swiss {{study of}} the {{nominate}} subspecies, 76% of eggs hatched, and 58% of chicks fledged. Birds of the race A. s. blakistoni in the Tian Shan hatched 90% of their eggs, and hatchlings survived to fledging in 47% of the nests. In the latter study, early nests {{were more likely to}} fail because less plant cover made them more likely to be found by predators. Neither the average lifespan nor the <b>maximum</b> <b>age</b> of survival are known.|$|E
5|$|Observations of {{the surface}} have {{revealed}} {{that some of the}} molecular oxygen produced by radiolysis is not ejected from the surface. Because the surface may interact with the subsurface ocean (considering the geological discussion above), this molecular oxygen may make its way to the ocean, where it could aid in biological processes. One estimate suggests that, given the turnover rate inferred from the apparent ~0.5 Gyr <b>maximum</b> <b>age</b> of Europa's surface ice, subduction of radiolytically generated oxidizing species might well lead to oceanic free oxygen concentrations that are comparable to those in terrestrial deep oceans.|$|E
40|$|The clone of the ciliated {{protozoan}} Paramecium caudatum has the immaturity {{period of}} about 60 fissions and the lifespan of about 600 fissions. These life cycle figures have been depicted through laboratory experiments that allow continuous cell divisions for hundreds, which never occur in nature. We here constructed the nature-mimicking model culture that alternated the log- and stationary phases to allow conjugation, and computer-simulated the age structure modifying parameters such as cell distributions to start the culture, fission rates, death rates, immaturity periods, probabilities of conjugation, proportions of transplantation and so on. The average and <b>maximum</b> <b>ages</b> in the culture after thousands of alternations were converged to 43 ± 2 and 140 ± 5 fissions, respectively, when parameters for the immaturity period and the maximum clonal lifespan were set at 60 and 600 fissions. This result explains why cells collected in nature are usually young and vigorous. The average and <b>maximum</b> <b>ages</b> proportionally prolonged as the immaturity period was prolonged, as reported true for species of the ciliate. These results indicate the validity of our simulation. The average and <b>maximum</b> <b>ages</b> remained unchanged when the initial condition for starting the culture was changed from two complementary mating-type cells to a population with a quadratic-functio...|$|R
40|$|Along the > 650 km long {{southern}} {{margin of}} the Karoo Basin in South Africa, we traversed four evenly spaced stratigraphic transects and collected 22 samples of volcanic, air-fall tuffs thought to be distal deposits derived from the Permian-Triassic Southern Gondwanan volcanic arc. We present 469 new U-Pb zircon ages determined by sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe reverse geometry (SHRIMP-RG) at the Stanford-USGS Microanalytical Center in order to constrain the <b>maximum</b> depositional <b>ages</b> for the southern Karoo Basin strata. Weighted means of these youngest coherent zircon populations were selected to maximize the number of analyses while minimizing the mean square weighted deviation (MSWD) to increase the robustness and decrease the influence of Pb-loss and inheritance in determining the <b>maximum</b> depositional <b>age.</b> <b>Maximum</b> depositional <b>ages</b> for the marine Ecca Group range from 250 to 274 Ma, whereas in the conformably overlying terrestrial Beaufort Group <b>maximum</b> depositional <b>ages</b> ranged from 257 to 452 Ma. Across the southern Karoo Basin, the Ecca Group tuffs produce <b>maximum</b> depositional <b>ages</b> that young upward; however, the Beaufort Group tuffs yield <b>maximum</b> depositional <b>ages</b> that are geochronologically out of sequence. Furthermore, <b>maximum</b> depositional <b>ages</b> of the Beaufort Group tuffs are consistently older than ash ages within the underlying marine strata. Our results are supported by previously published U-Pb tuff zircon geochronology in the Karoo Basin and demonstrate {{that the presence of}} out-of-sequence, older tuff ages are repeatable in Beaufort Group tuffs along the southern {{margin of the}} basin. We propose that tuffs in the Karoo Basin are correlative with tuffs in southern South America, and that the age spectra of these tuffs were influenced by magmatic crustal recycling. We use these data to highlight the complexity of U-Pb zircon datasets from tuffs, address the use of U-Pb zircon ages to provide absolute age controls, and discuss the implications of these new age controls on the Permian-Triassic Karoo strata...|$|R

5|$|Both {{the males}} and females become sexually mature {{by the time they}} are a year-and-a-half old. However, males {{actually}} mate after the age of four to five years. Males and females are most reproductive till the age of 14 and 14–18 years, respectively, with the <b>maximum</b> <b>age</b> of successful lactation in females being 13–14 years. With no fixed breeding season; births may occur at any time of the year. A study at Dvůr Králové Zoo (Czech Republic) showed that 55% of the births occurred between September and December. A rutting male tests the urine of any female he encounters, to which the female responds by urinating. Having located a female in estrus, the male follows her closely, trying to rub his cheek on her rump, head, neck, and chest. He performs gasping movements with his lips. Finally, the male mounts the female, resting his head and neck on her back, in a similar way as other tragelaphines.|$|E
30|$|It was {{hypothesized}} that perhaps enrolling older subjects might increase the false positive error due to {{the addition of the}} extracted teeth into the sample.

40|$|I present in-situ {{analysis}} of U-Pb systematics in baddeleyite and whitlockite grains from {{a suite of}} Martian shergottites. 9 baddeleyite grains (5 from basaltic shergottite NWA 2986 and 4 from olivine-phyric shergottite RBT 04262) were analyzed by LA-MC-ICP-MS. Despite low uranium and radiogenic lead concentrations, <b>maximum</b> <b>ages</b> could be determined for both samples: 187 ± 50 to 1236 ± 430 for NWA 2986 and 100 ± 9 to 526 ± 48 for RBT 04262. The same analytical procedures were used for whitlockites in NWA 2986, ALHA 77005, EETA 79001, NWA 2646 and LAR 06319. As with the baddeleyite analyses, <b>maximum</b> <b>ages</b> were calculated. These ages ranged from 110 ± 1 for LAR 06319 to 561 ± 185 for NWA 2646. These results, which are consistent with previous analyses, mean that the ~ 4 Ga age determined from Pb-Pb analyses cannot time the igneous crystallization of these meteorites...|$|R
5|$|Following {{the tests}} in Oslo, a {{delegation}} {{was sent to}} look at compatible systems outside Oslo. After it had returned, the company went into negotiations with three manufacturers: Duewag, Bautzen and Ansaldo/Firema. Oslo Sporveier {{signed a contract with}} Ansaldo/Firema for delivery of 17 units in 1997–98, with options for additional 15 units. The first 17 units cost , or NOK20million per vehicle. The option rights were later exercised, and the total order was increased to 32. This allowed Oslo Sporveier to replace all trams that were not articulated, and would give a <b>maximum</b> <b>age</b> in the tram fleet to 18 years. While Oslo Sporveier at first had planned to debt-finance the purchase, by 1999 it was decided that the trams would be leased from Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken. Due to a labor dispute about privatizing the operation of the tramway and the Oslo Metro, the ownership of all trams and metro trains, including the SL95, were transferred to the municipally owned limited company Oslo Vognselskap in 2007.|$|E

40|$|The Espinhaço Basin {{in eastern}} Brazil {{contains}} depositional sequences {{developed in the}} São Francisco paleoplate and its margins. Detailed mapping was conducted and combined with U–Pb detrital zircon dating to determine the sedimentological-stratigraphic framework, provenance and minimum and <b>maximum</b> <b>ages</b> of the syn-rift-deposits. The two cycles have minimum ages of 1192 and 923 Ma and <b>maximum</b> <b>ages</b> of 1785 and 1685 Ma. The first depositional cycle, represented by the Bandeirinha and São João da Chapada formations, is marked by contributions of Neoarchean and Paleoproterozoic detrital zircons. The second cycle, the diamond-bearing Sopa-Brumadinho Formation, also contains Mesoproterozoic zircons formed between 1300 and 1190 Ma, which suggests an additional external source of Grenvillian age, that was not previously recorded in the São Francisco Craton.

5|$|When Backer et al. {{reported}} their finding in November 1982, {{they found that}} the rotation period of PSR B1937+21 was increasing at a rate of 3 seconds per second. Pulsars are expected to slow over time, as the energy that they emit is ultimately drawn from the rotational energy of the pulsar. Using the initially observed values for the period and spin down rate, and assuming a minimum period of 0.5 milliseconds for pulsars, the <b>maximum</b> <b>age</b> for PSR B1937+21 was found to be about 750 years old. The estimate of the minimum possible period is obtained from the centrifugal break-up limit, which is the rotational period at which the centrifugal force and the self-gravity of the pulsar are equal. The value of the minimum rotational period depends upon the neutron star equation of state, with different models giving values between 0.3 and 1 millisecond, which corresponds to a rotation frequency of 1-3 kilohertz. There may be mechanisms such as gravitational radiation which keep the pulsar from reaching this absolute limit, but pulsars can spin no faster.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. —Growth {{of hybrid}} striped bass (white bass Morone chrysops × striped bass M. saxatilis) {{throughout}} North America was summarized to evalu-ate latitudinal differences in growth. Age was estimated from scales and otoliths (nondifferentiated) collected from 29 populations in 12 states. Hybrid striped bass populations were delineated by midwestern, southeastern, and southwest-ern regions. Growth among regions was compared by fitting a von Bertalanffy growth model to each population and by comparing mean length at capture (fall-sampled fish) for ages 1 and 3 and <b>maximum</b> <b>ages.</b> Midwestern populations ex-emplified the highest theoretical maximum length (L∞), followed by southeastern populations, although {{differences were not}} significant among regions. Likewise, growth coefficients (K) and <b>maximum</b> <b>ages</b> did not differ among regions.
