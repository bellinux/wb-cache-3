40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis {{is a study}} of the recent advances in microwave device technology that {{can be applied to the}} improvement of phased array radar systems which are able to provide multifunction capabilities to navy ships. The study was undertaken to provide guidance to military planners who are often required to keep abreast of developments in a rapidly changing field of technology. The fact that even the most advanced presently used radar systems in the navy are based on five to ten year-old technology, verifies the need for this study. <b>Microwave</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Modules</b> which combine vacuum tube and Solid State technology have been developed and have demonstrated advanced performance characteristics. Their advantages, such as very wide bandwidth and ability to operate at much higher ambient temperatures over that of the Solid State devices have opened up new opportunities for their use in Radar systems. However, output power capability of MPM while growing rapidly is still below the minimum level required for a phased array radar on board a midsize hip operating in confined waters. The present technology available however in Solid State Transmit Receive modules, does supply the capabilities needed for a realization of an active phased array radar. Such a system will enhance ships operational capabilities while achieving a reduction of the prime power consumption as well as in needed space.

40|$|A {{new class}} of compact and {{lightweight}} S-band 1 kW traveling-wave tube (TWT) is being developed for a <b>microwave</b> <b>power</b> <b>module</b> (MPM) {{that will be used}} for phased antenna array radar applications. The proposed S-band MPM provides a tenfold peak power increase compared to state-of-the-art S-band MPMs. In this paper, the design of the vacuum power booster TWT part of the MPM is presented.

40|$|A low-cost, low-mass, {{electrically}} efficient, modular cathode/electron gun assembly {{has been}} developed by FDE Inc. of Beaverton, Oregon, under a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract with the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field. This new assembly offers significant improvements {{in the design and}} manufacture of microwave and millimeter wave traveling-wave tubes (TWT's) used for radar and communications. It incorporates a novel, low-heater-power, reduced size and mass, high-performance barium dispenser type thermionic cathode and provides for easy integration of the cathode into a large variety of conventional TWT circuits. Among the applications are TWT's for Earth-orbiting communication satellites and for deep space communications, where future missions will require smaller spacecraft, higher data transfer rates (higher frequencies and radiofrequency output power), and greater electrical efficiency. A particularly important TWT application is in the <b>microwave</b> <b>power</b> <b>module</b> (a hybrid microwave/millimeter wave amplifier consisting of a low-noise solid-state driver, a small TWT, and an electronic power conditioner integrated into a single compact package), where electrical efficiency and thermal loading are critical factors and lower cost is needed for successful commercialization. The design and fabrication are based on practices used in producing cathode ray tubes (CRT's), {{which is one of the}} most competitive and efficient manufacturing operations in the world today. The approach used in the design and manufacture of thermionic cathodes and electron guns for CRT's has been optimized for fully automated production, standardization of parts, and minimization of costs. It is applicable to the production of similar components for microwave tubes, with the additional benefits of low mass and significantly lower cathode heater power (less than half that of dispenser cathodes presently used in TWT s). Modular cathode/electron gun assembly. The modular cathode/electron gun assembly consists of four subassemblies the cathode, the focus electrode, the header (including the electrical feedthroughs), and the gun envelope (including the anode) a diagram of which is shown. The modular construction offers a number of significant advantages, including flexibility of design, interchangeability of parts, and a drop-in final assembly procedure for quick and accurate alignment. The gun can accommodate cathodes ranging in size from 0. 050 to 0. 250 -in. in diameter and is applicable to TWT's over a broad range of sizes and operating parameters, requiring the substitution of only a few parts: that is, the cathode, focus electrode, and anode. The die-pressed cathode pellets can be made with either flat or concave (Pierce gun design) emitting surfaces. The gun can be either gridded (pulse operation) or ungridded (continuous operation). Important factors contributing to low cost are the greater use of CRT materials and parts, the standardization of processes (welding and mechanical capture), and tooling amenable to automated production. Examples are the use of simple shapes, drawn or stamped metal parts, and parts joined by welding or mechanical capture. Feasibility was successfully demonstrated in the retrofit and testing of a commercial Kaband (22 -GHz) TWT. The modular cathode/electron gun assembly was computer modeled to replicate the performance of the original electron gun and fabricated largely from existing CRT parts. Significant test results included demonstration of low heater power (1. 5 -W, 1010 C brightness temperature for a 0. 085 -in. -diameter cathode), mechanical ruggedness (100 g shock and vibration tests in accordance with military specifications (MIL specs)), and a very fast warmup. The results of these tests indicate that the low-cost CRT manufacturing approach can be used without sacrificing performance and reliability...|$|E
