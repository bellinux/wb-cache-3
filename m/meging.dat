At that time ISA was the only school in Scotland to offer the IB Diploma to its senior students.In December 2005, in the midst of on-going construction work to add a new gymnasium and theatre complex, the school was notified by the Scottish Government that a major roadworks project was being planned to run through the Fairgirth property.In August 2010 the International School of Aberdeen moved into its new, purpose-built campus at Pitfodels House.|$|E
50|$|<b>Meged</b> 5. In 2009 the {{partnership}} {{announced that it}} had found indications of significant quantities of oil at its <b>Meged</b> 5 site.

The <b>Meged</b> 5 well is located on land designated a training zone by the Israel Defense Forces.|$|R
50|$|<b>Meged</b> 2. In 1998 the {{partnership}} announced {{that in the}} course of tests it was conducting at the <b>Meged</b> 2 bore, unidentified fluids accompanied by gas gushed out of the bore at a rate of 400 barrels a day. <b>Meged</b> 2 was abandoned in the years following.|$|R

50|$|<b>Meged</b> 3. In 2000, after earlier {{having said}} it had found {{significant}} quantities of natural gas at the <b>Meged</b> 3 prospect, Givot announced a halt of drilling operations there on account of a technical failure. When the technical failure was resolved and drilling operations resumed, Givot announced that <b>Meged</b> 3 would be abandoned as the natural gas was not available in commercial quantities.|$|R
50|$|<b>Meges</b> was {{credited}} with killing a number of opponents, including Pedaeus (a son of Antenor), Croesmus, Amphiclus, Itymoneus, Agelaus, Eurymenes, and Deiopites. Dolops attempted to strike him with a spear but the corselet <b>Meges</b> was wearing, a gift for his father from Euphetes of Ephyra, saved his life. <b>Meges</b> helped Odysseus to collect gifts for Achilles. He {{was one of the}} men to enter the Trojan Horse.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Meged</b> {{oil field}} is {{located near the}} towns of Kfar Saba and Rosh Ha'Ayin in Israel. It is {{situated}} close to {{the southern tip of}} the Palmyra rift system, a geological formation that extends across Syria to the northeast. Givot Olam, which owns and operates the <b>Meged</b> license, first announced its discovery of the <b>Meged</b> field in April 2004. The field spans 200 square kilometers.|$|R
50|$|The stamps {{were issued}} in sheets of 35, printed on white woven unwatermarked paper, in the <b>Mège</b> Lithograph Workshop of <b>Mège</b> y Willems Printing Ltd in Montevideo. The set was redrawn on 1 October 1857.|$|R
50|$|According to Dictys Cretensis, <b>Meges</b> fell at Troy. Pausanias {{mentions}} {{a painting}} of him wounded in the arm by a Trojan, Admetes the son of Augeas. Tzetzes relates that <b>Meges,</b> along with Prothous {{and a number of}} others, perished at Euboea.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mège</b> {{focussed}} on fat processing in the 1860s, which {{culminated in}} 1869 in a patent for margarine. His invention involved mixing processed beef tallow with skimmed milk, {{and resulted in}} a cheap but qualitatively good substitute for butter 'for the working class and incidentally the Navy'. <b>Mège</b> received a prize from the French government, formally led by Emperor Louis Napoleon III. In 1871, <b>Mège</b> sold his invention to the Dutch firm Jurgens, one of the pillars of Unilever.|$|R
40|$|AbstractGATA- 1 is an {{essential}} transcription factor for megakaryocyte and erythrocyte (<b>MegE)</b> development. Here we show that hematopoietic progenitors can be reprogrammed by the instructive action of GATA- 1. Enforced expression of GATA- 1 in hematopoietic stem cells led to loss of self-renewal activity and the exclusive generation of <b>MegE</b> lineages. Strikingly, ectopic GATA- 1 reprogrammed common lymphoid progenitors as well as granulocyte/monocyte (GM) progenitors to differentiate into <b>MegE</b> lineages, while inhibiting normal lymphoid or GM differentiation. GATA- 1 upregulated critical MegE-related transcription factors such as FOG- 1 and GATA- 2 in lymphoid and GM progenitors, and their <b>MegE</b> development did not require “permissive” erythropoietin signals. Furthermore, GATA- 1 induced apoptosis of proB and myelomonocytic cells, {{which could not be}} prevented by enforced permissive Bcl- 2 or myeloid cytokine signals. Thus, GATA- 1 specifically instructs <b>MegE</b> commitment while excluding other fate outcomes in stem and progenitor cells, suggesting that regulation of GATA- 1 is critical in maintaining multilineage homeostasis...|$|R
50|$|<b>Meged</b> 4. After an {{exploratory}} drilling at the <b>Meged</b> 4 well in 1994 {{had failed to}} turn up oil in commercial quantities, in 2003 Givot Olam reported that tests it was conducting at <b>Meged</b> 4 indicated the presence {{of oil and gas}} 4,400 meters below the surface. 64 barrels of oil were recovered from the borehole before Givot announced in 2005 that it was discontinuing drilling operations after test results indicated that there was not enough oil to make development commercially viable.|$|R
50|$|Dolops the Trojan, son of Lampus. In the Iliad, he confronted <b>Meges</b> in {{a battle}} and could have killed him if not for Meges' strong corselet; as <b>Meges</b> fought back, Menelaus {{attacked}} Dolops from behind and killed him, whereupon the Greeks removed his armor.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} as Hippolyte <b>Mège,</b> {{the son of}} a primary school teacher, but later added his mother's surname to his own. In 1838, <b>Mège</b> {{obtained}} a job in the central pharmacy of the Hôtel-Dieu hospital in Paris and started to publish original contributions in applied chemistry.|$|R
50|$|In early January 2012, Givot Olam {{reported}} that the state had rejected the company's proposal to drill at <b>Meged</b> wells 6, 7 and 8. Later in the month Givot {{reported that}} it had obtained approval to proceed with drilling operations at <b>Meged</b> wells 5, 6 and 14.|$|R

40|$|SummaryA {{model of}} hematopoietic {{development}} wherein multipotentiality is conserved until segregation of myeloid and lymphoid potential {{has recently been}} challenged, proposing that megakaryocyte/erythrocyte (<b>MegE)</b> potential is lost in Flk 2 /Flt 3 -expressing early progenitors. Here, we used sensitive in vivo approaches to quantitatively and kinetically assess the <b>MegE</b> potential of hematopoietic stem cells and various Flk 2 + early progenitors and compared it with the <b>MegE</b> potential of downstream committed myeloid and lymphoid progenitors and with their ability to give rise to mature myelomonocytic and lymphoid cells. We demonstrate that Flk 2 + early progenitors retain <b>MegE</b> potential in vivo both at the population and clonal levels. These results indicate that Flk 2 expression by early progenitors is {{not at the expense}} of full multipotency and support the current model of hematopoietic development with segregation of myeloid and lymphoid lineages from multipotent progenitors...|$|R
