He studied at Hungarian University of Fine Arts in Budapest between 1947 and 1953. His teachers were István Szőnyi, László Bencze (painter), Gyula Pap (painter) and Jenő Barcsay. He immigrated to France in 1956. He continued his {{education in the}} field of fine arts in Paris, then in Nice. Initially, he painted surrealistic and dark pictures full of sombre colours that recall paintings of Grünewald and Bosch. By the late eighties, he came quite near to the limits of abstraction, and turned toward a more liberated, more colourful and less figurative art. Later, he painted expressive pictures with <b>mosaic</b> <b>effect.</b> In addition to paintings, he made sculptures as well; one of his monumental creations {{stands in front of the}} building of Médiathèque François Mitterrand in Sète, France. His paintings were exhibited in several art galleries, inter alia in Zurich, Chicago, New York, Montreal, Paris, Lyon, Nimes, Madrid, Milan and Geneva.|$|E
5000|$|Young Girl Running on Balcony mainly {{addresses}} dynamism, {{the phenomenon}} Futurists devoted {{their lives to}} illustrating. Merriam-Webster defines it as the “theory that all phenomena (as matter or motion) can be explained as manifestations of force." [...] The Futurists believed that everything is made of dynamic forces, and that everything is in constant motion. This idea is best noted in the girl’s repeated form across the canvas, which works to represent her actual movement through space. The lines are not very definitive between each form; in fact, there aren’t many lines at all. The piece emulates an unusual sort of micro-cubist style. Balla also calls upon the techniques of both French Pointillism and Italian Divisionism. Pointillist painters utilize tiny points, which they dot on the canvas to create an image. Georges Seurat demonstrated the technique most famously in his piece, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. Conversely, the Divisionists, based {{in the north of}} Italy, used long brush strokes, more rectangular in shape than the Pointillists’ dots, and painted them next to strokes of contrasting color to create texture and depth in an image. Giovanni Segantini was famous for his pastoral representations of life in the Alps; his 1893 Afternoon in the Alps exemplifies his mastery of the Divisionist style. Balla emulates both these artists in Young Girl Running on Balcony by using tiny squares to create a <b>mosaic</b> <b>effect.</b> The many squares further break down the image of the girl herself and force the viewer to focus not on her form, but on her fragmented motion through time and space. Her movement, blurred lines between each step, is not exactly disjointed nor is it really fluid, but it is definitely continuous.|$|E

5000|$|The {{uncertainty}} in estimating the tonnage of mineral resources or ore reserves {{depends on a}} number of factors, and the uncertainty of definition of the deposit boundaries is one of them. [...] In deposits with sharp contacts, the geometry may be relatively simple, nevertheless, there is always uncertainty caused by lack of information and large drill hole grid.Generally, these boundaries are determined by mineral grade rather than geological properties: deposit boundaries are chosen based on the cut-off grade. Changing the important factor of cut-off grade, the boundaries of the deposit can be extended or contracted. For this reason, even for the deposits with sharp boundaries, a clear definition of the cut-off grade and distinction between ore and gangue due to dilution during mining, the presence of intermediate layer and the limitation of mining in a selective way are essential. However, {{in the case of the}} exploitation of soft materials, extraction can be done more selectively and it would be easier to take into account the geological and geometrical limits.On the other hand, sometimes the uncertainty on the estimation of grades is bigger than the uncertainty on the boundaries definition. Estimation is then performed inside predefined boundaries. One can imagine that the anisotropy and structural complexity of the deposit are due to its geometrical form, while the geometrical dimension of the deposit help us to guess about its economical value. Geometrical features can appear in variographic studies and usually they affect, or hide, grade distribution structures. The presence of a series of nearly homogeneous kaolin areas, linked together in zones, creates a <b>mosaic</b> <b>effect.</b> This phenomenon is due to the existence of periodical settling regimes of the rivers. The size of these zones can affect the form of the variogram and increase the nugget effect due to high differences of values in the edge of the zones. A hole effect is one the other known phenomena caused by the presence of two or more separated lenses with low difference in grade and shape. The distance between these lenses can thus be estimated.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{techniques}} for overcoming the <b>mosaic</b> <b>effect</b> - {{an impediment to}} the sharing of content, and proposes layered re-use as a conceptual framework for solving the problem. The <b>mosaic</b> <b>effect</b> occurs when a course is built by sequencing Shareable Content Objects (SCOs) {{from a variety of}} independent sources. Because SCOs have their own individual "look and feel", courses made up of SCOs from different sources suffer from inconsistent presentation styles and interfaces in the format of the learning content. To overcome the <b>mosaic</b> <b>effect,</b> it is necessary to separate content from its presentation. Two techniques have been put forward as solutions to the <b>mosaic</b> <b>effect</b> in the SCORM environment. The first is the Dynamic Appearance Model (DAM) and the second is SCORM with Style-Sheet Support (SCORM-SSS). While the DAM proposes content to be encoded in XML and uses XSL transformations for correct rendering, SCORM-SSS is based on content in HTML and proposes course related style-sheets to ensure the desired course presentation. This paper develops the concept of layered re-use in which the re-use of content and content structures is governed by specifications appropriate to the content level (e. g. SCORM, IMS QTI specifications) and the re-use of" look and feel" properties and their application throughout a course is governed by HTML-based specifications applied at the display level. In layered re-use terms, for any one course there may be many content models within the content layer and for a particular user or cohort there is a single display model. The advantages of adopting layered re-use include, a) ease of technical implementation (at scale and wide scope), b) low impact on course development work-flows, c) ease of maintenance against growing complexity in course design and re-design and d) it supports the DAM and SCORM-SSS developments as complementary approaches to overcoming the <b>mosaic</b> <b>effect.</b> 3 / 7 / 2004 to 7 / 7 / 2004 Open Acces...|$|E

However, several of these processes were severely affected by point mutations. From the overall results of 16 mutants reported here, four groups were distinguished. One group significantly affected neither biosynthesis nor folding of opsin (D 83 N, P 291 A, A 299 C-V 300 A-P 303 G). A second group produced a truncated protein (R 69 H, Y 301 F), suggesting that these positions are essential for a correct translational process.

40|$|Anendocrine-disrupting {{chemical}} (EDC) is an exogenous chemical, or {{mixture of}} chemicals, that {{can interfere with}} any aspect of hormone action. The potential for deleterious effects of EDC must be considered relative to the regulation of hormone synthesis, secretion, and actions and the variability in regulation of these events across the life cycle. The developmental age at which EDC exposures occur is a critical consideration in understanding their effects. Because endocrine systems exhibit tissue-, cell-, and receptor-specific actions during the life cycle, EDC can produce complex, <b>mosaic</b> <b>effects.</b> This complexity causes difficulty when a static approach to toxicity through endocrine mechanisms driven by rigid guidelines is used to identify EDC and manage risk to human and wildlife populations. We propose that principles taken from fundamental endocrinology be employed to identify EDC and manage their risk to exposed populations. We {{emphasize the importance of}} developmental stage and, in particular, the realization that exposure to a presumptive "safe" dose of chemical may impact a life stage when there is normally no endogenous hormone exposure, thereby underscoring the potential for very low-dose EDC exposures to have potent and irreversible effects. Finally, with regard to the current program designed to detect putative EDC, namely, the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program, we offer recommendations for strengthening this program through the incorporation of basic endocrine principles to promote further understanding of complex EDC effects, especially due to developmental exposures.

40|$|Introduction It was {{observed}} (see [1], [2]) that the Smith-Waterman algorithm for local sequence alignment has two essential flaws: it often finds long alignments {{with a high}} score and misses shorter ones with {{a higher degree of}} similarity (the shadow effect); and it often combines two or more segments of high similarity and aligns internal segments that are not related (the <b>mosaic</b> <b>effect).</b> Arslan et. al. [2] proposed an O(n log n) algorithm that outputs a normalized local alignment which maximizes the degree of similarity (alignment score divided by alignment length) rather than the total similarity score. Given a properly selected normalization parameter, the new algorithm eliminates both the shadow and mosaic effects. Unfortunately, determining a proper normalization parameter requires repeated executions with different parameter values, and also expert feedback to determine the usefulness of the alignments.

40|$|SARSA is a web {{tool that}} can be used to align two or more RNA {{tertiary}} structures. The basic idea behind SARSA is that we use the vector quantization approach to derive a structural alphabet (SA) of 23 nucleotide conformations, via which we transform RNA 3 D structures into 1 D sequences of SA letters and then utilize classical sequence alignment methods to compare these 1 D SA-encoded sequences and determine their structural similarities. In SARSA, we provide two RNA structural alignment tools, PARTS for pairwise alignment of RNA tertiary structures and MARTS for multiple alignment of RNA tertiary structures. Particularly in PARTS, we have implemented four kinds of pairwise alignments for a variety of practical applications: (i) global alignment for comparing whole structural similarity, (ii) semiglobal alignment for detecting structural motifs, (iii) local alignment for finding locally similar substructures and (iv) normalized local alignment for eliminating the <b>mosaic</b> <b>effect</b> of local alignment.

It has been proven that crop reflectance data {{can be used to}} detect, characterise and quantify disease severity and plant density. In this thesis, various methods were proposed and used for detection, characterisation and quantification of disease severity and plant density utilising data acquired by hand-held spectrometers. Following this direction, hyperspectral images provide both spatial and spectral information opening for more efficient analysis. Hence, in this thesis, various surface water quality parameters of inland waters have been monitored using hyperspectral images acquired by airborne systems. After processing the images to obtain ground reflectance data, the analysis was performed using similar methods to those of the previous case. Hence, these methods may also find application in future satellite based hyperspectral imaging systems. However, the large size of these images raises the need for efficient data reduction. Self organising and learning neural networks, that can follow and preserve the topology of the data, {{have been shown to be}} efficient for data reduction. More advanced variants of these neural networks, referred to as the weighted neural networks (WNN), were proposed in this thesis, such as the weighted incremental neural network (WINN), which can be used for efficient reduction, mapping and clustering of large high-dimensional data sets, such as hyperspectral images.

Thus far, the majority of endocrine disruptor {{research has focused on}} the interference of compounds with the sex hormone homeostasis. Less {{attention has been paid to}} disruption of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis, despite the fact that several lines of evidence suggest that this system is also susceptible to disruption by compounds present in the environment. Disturbances in thyroid hormone (TH) homeostasis may lead to <b>mosaic</b> <b>effects</b> on development, growth patterns and metabolism in vertebrates including mammals and amphibians. Recent studies now indicate that the Thyroid hormone Receptors (TRs) also are targets of industrial compounds, but the effects and mechanisms are difficult to establish since suitable test assays are very limited. In part, this may be because research has generally focused on the ability of compounds to affect TH transport, TH metabolism and TH blood plasma levels but not on disruption of TR mediated TH-action. The research presented in this thesis aims to enhance insight into the mechanisms underlying the effects of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) on TR-mediated TH-action. To this end, newly developed and validated in vitro and in vivo assays are applied in addition to an ex vivo assay using isolated tail tissue. This ex vivo model more resembles the natural situation for cells than in vitro assays, but excludes the feedback mechanisms from the TH axis or extracellular metabolism which may obscure TR-mediated responses. In the assays exposure is performed in combination with TH in order to closer approach the exposure of cells under physiological conditions, where TH is present during important vertebrate fetal developmental periods. The in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo assay responses also are compared to study to what degree the in vitro and ex vivo assays can predict the in vivo thyroid hormone disrupting potency of compounds. Apart from the development of new testsystems for thyroid hormone disruption, the studies presented in this thesis also provide indications for the mechanism of EDCs on the level of the TR. Furthermore, the results illustrate that the in vitro results are highly predictive for the effects as observed in vivo. Finally, it can be concluded that testing of compounds for potential TH disrupting effects, should be carried out in presence and absence of TH at its EC 50...|$|R
25|$|Mosaic {{is the art}} {{of decorating}} solid {{surfaces}} with pieces of multi-coloured stone or glass set in mortar. Golden mosaic can be created by applying gold leaf to a single surface of a transparent glass tile, and placing the gilt inwards towards the mortar so that it is visible but cannot be scraped. The gilt tiles are often used as a background to figures, giving a glowing and sumptuous <b>effect.</b> <b>Mosaic</b> can be applied equally well to flat or curved surfaces and is often used to decorate vaults and domes. In churches where mosaic is applied extensively, it gives an impression that the interior of the church has been spread with a blanket of pictures and patterns.|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{analyzed}} {{the dynamics of}} dominant plant species in a grazed grassland over 17 years, and investi-gated whether local shifts in these dominant species, leading to vegetation mosaics, {{could be attributed to}} in-teractions between plants and soil-borne pathogens. We found that Festuca rubra and Carex arenaria locally al-ternated in abundance, with different sites close together behaving out of phase, resulting in a shifting <b>mosaic.</b> The net <b>effect</b> of killing all soil biota on the growth of these two species was investigated in a greenhouse ex-periment using gamma radiation, controlling for possible effects of sterilization on soil chemistry. Both plant spe-cies showed a strong net positive response to soil steril-ization, indicating that pathogens (e. g., nematodes, pathogenic fungi) outweighed the effect of mutualist...|$|R
