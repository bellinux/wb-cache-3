5|$|Ruth's legendary {{power and}} charismatic {{personality}} {{made him a}} larger-than-life figure during the Roaring Twenties. During his career, he {{was the target of}} intense press and public attention for his baseball exploits and off-field penchants for drinking and womanizing. His often reckless lifestyle was tempered by his willingness to do good by visiting children at hospitals and orphanages. After his retirement as a player, he was denied a <b>managerial</b> <b>job</b> in baseball, most likely due to poor behavior during parts of his playing career. In his final years, Ruth made many public appearances, especially in support of American efforts in World War II. In 1946, he became ill with cancer, which claimed his life two years later.|$|E

Stengel was paid for one year left on his contract, {{and he was not}} involved in baseball during the 1937 season. Stengel had invested in oil properties, as advised by one of his players, Randy Moore, a Texan; the investment helped make the Stengels well to do, and they put the profits in California real estate. Stengel considered going in the oil business full-time, but Braves president Bob Quinn offered him the Boston <b>managerial</b> <b>job</b> in late 1937, and he accepted.|$|E

Mathers resigned from his post in May 1935 to take the <b>managerial</b> <b>job</b> at Newcastle United, ending his 12-year tenure. Bob McGrory was appointed as the club's manager shortly afterward; he had previously played for the club for 14 years. In the 1935–36 season, the club finished fourth in the Football League First Division, nine points adrift of champions Sunderland. This was followed by two successive mid-table finishes, in 1936–37 and 1937–38. The club recorded its record league win, 10–3, over West Bromwich Albion in February 1937, in which Steele scored five goals. In April of that year, the club achieved its largest league crowd—51,373 against Arsenal. Steele's 33 league goals in the 1936–37 season remains a club record in 2007.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the 2000–01 season, McClaren {{began looking}} for a <b>managerial</b> <b>job,</b> having decided his chances of {{succeeding}} Ferguson at Old Trafford were slim; at the time, Ferguson was planning to retire the following summer, but would ultimately remain in charge of United for a further 11 seasons. With a positive reputation and closely linked with three Premier League vacancies, Middlesbrough chairman Steve Gibson won the race to appoint him after McClaren turned down Southampton and West Ham United. His appointment came after the resignation of former Manchester United captain Bryan Robson, who had been in charge of the Teesside club for seven years and established them as a Premier League club. In his first season, Middlesbrough reached the FA Cup semi-final, knocking out his previous employers Manchester United in the fourth round, but lost 0–1 to Arsenal. They finished 12th in the league, a small improvement on the previous season's 14th-place finish. The following season brought another modest improvement, this time finishing 11th, although they had been in higher positions – and the race for a UEFA Cup place – for most of the season.|$|E

He guided Redbridge to the Isthmian League title, and with it promotion to the Conference in 1990–91. Still took Redbridge to a seventh-placed finish in the next season and remained with the club as it yet again merged, this time with Dagenham to become Dagenham & Redbridge, in the summer of 1992.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the factors {{underpinning}} occupational success. This is defined, first, in terms of the chances of obtaining professional and <b>managerial</b> <b>jobs</b> and then, having secured such jobs, in terms of the monetary rewards received. The study is based on unit record data from the Australian Census of Population for 2001 and it places particular emphasis on the role of race and ethnicity in determining occupational success. It argues that the role of race in determining labour market advantage in Australia changed significantly between 1996 and 2001. In 1996, being born in Australia, or in one of the old Commonwealth countries, was very important in conferring advantage in the labour market. In 2001, this was no longer a factor. Asian men and women outperformed Australian and (old) Commonwealth born persons, sometimes in terms of access to professional and <b>managerial</b> <b>jobs,</b> sometimes in terms of the rewards attached to such jobs, and sometimes in terms of both access and rewards.

An analysis of the results showed ffiat the largest proportion of women workers were married (49. 9 %), were in the 26 - 35 -irear-old age group (29. 4 %), and had no children (61. 7 %). The majority of women in professional and <b>managerial</b> <b>jobs</b> were married or cohabiting. However, a larger than expected proportion of women with <b>managerial</b> <b>jobs</b> were widowed, divorced, or separated. A greater proportion of professional and managerial workers compared to semi-sLilled, unsPilled, and service workers were childless. The percentage of women workers without spouses who were parents was similar to the percentage of ao. rried women who had children.
