2500|$|Vitamin A is {{converted}} by the protein RPE65 within the {{retinal pigment epithelium}} into 11-cis-retinal. This molecule is then transported into the photoreceptor cells of the retina, where it acts as a light-activated <b>molecular</b> <b>switch</b> within opsin proteins that activates a complex cascade called the visual cycle. This cycle begins with 11-cis retinal absorbing light and isomerizing into all-trans retinal. The change in shape of the molecule after absorbing light in turn changes {{the configuration of the}} complex protein rhodopsin, the visual pigment used in low light levels. [...] This represents the first step of the visual cycle. This is why eating foods rich in vitamin A is often said to allow an individual to see in the dark, although the effect they have on one's vision is negligible. In fact, excess vitamin A intake can cause toxicity to the optic nerve and permanent vision loss.|$|E
2500|$|Rotaxane-based {{molecular}} machines {{have been}} of initial interest for their potential use in molecular electronics as logic molecular switching elements and as molecular shuttles. These molecular machines are usually based on {{the movement of the}} macrocycle on the dumbbell. The macrocycle can rotate around the axis of the dumbbell like a wheel and axle or it can slide along its axis from one site to another. Controlling the position of the macrocycle allows the rotaxane to function as a <b>molecular</b> <b>switch,</b> with each possible location of the macrocycle corresponding to a different state. These rotaxane machines can be manipulated both by chemical [...] and photochemical inputs. Rotaxane based systems have also been shown to function as molecular muscles. In 2009, there was a report of a [...] "domino effect" [...] from one extremity to the other in a Glycorotaxane Molecular Machine. In this case, the 4C1 or 1C4 chair-like conformation of the mannopyranoside stopper can be controlled, depending on the localization of the macrocycle. In 2012, unique pseudo-macrocycles consisting of double-lasso molecular machines (also called rotamacrocycles) were reported in Chem. Sci. These structures can be tightened or loosened depending on pH. A controllable jump rope movement was also observed in these new molecular machines.|$|E

40|$|Repair of {{double-stranded}} breaks (DSBs) {{is vital}} to maintaining genomic stability.

40|$|Peptidergic {{signaling}} regulates cardiac contractility; thus, identifying <b>molecular</b> <b>switches,</b> li-gand-receptor contacts, and antagonists aids {{in exploring}} {{the underlying mechanisms}} to in-fluence health. Myosuppressin (MS), a decapeptide, diminishes cardiac contractility and gut motility. Myosuppressin binds to G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) proteins. Two Dro-sophila melanogastermyosuppressin receptors (DrmMS-Rs) exist; however, no mecha-nism underlying MS-R activation is reported. We predicted DrmMS-Rs contained <b>molecular</b> <b>switches</b> that resembled those of Rhodopsin.
