500|$|Community members {{often become}} {{involved}} in the debate over banning fighting. In December 2006, a school board trustee in London, Ontario attended a London Knights game and was shocked by the fighting and by the crowd's positive reaction to it. [...] This experience led him to organize an ongoing effort to ban fighting in the Ontario Hockey League, where the Knights compete, by attempting to gain the support of other school boards and by writing letters to OHL administrators. On the advice of its <b>Medical</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Officer,</b> the Middlesex-London Health board has supported recommendations to ban fighting across amateur hockey and to increase disciplinary measures to ensure deterrence.|$|E

While most of the sod cottages were torn down after enclosure, the remaining dwellings were in such poor condition that in 1883, Gateshead's <b>Medical</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Officer</b> described their standard as one of abject squalor. Some private housing estates were built in Sheriff Hill around 1900, including the Egremont Estatea distinctive estate dating from around 1910 where the houses have flat roofs with steps leading to them as an architectural feature, and also at Sourmilk Hill, where there are some irregularly arranged vernacular houses built from locally quarried stone and slate which give the area [...] "the character of a small, rural farmstead". These developments did little to alleviate the unsanitary conditions and the chronic overcrowding {{in the village and}} across the borough. In light of these problems Gateshead Council, after having previously refused in 1911 and 1917, decided to purchase [...] of land in Carr Hill and Sheriff Hill under the Housing Act 1919 at a cost of £19,000 in February 1919.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent decades}} {{researchers}} have used Census-based socio-economic models {{to explain why}} some people are healthier than others. Little attention has been directed to survey-based methods for quantifying socio-economic inequality due to the inherent subjectivity of individual responses in characterizing data. This thesis argues that this very subjectivity allows us to better understand and evaluate social gradients in health status. A survey instrument was developed and distributed to British Columbia’s <b>Medical</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Officers</b> (MHOs) {{as part of a}} methodology for identifying the socio-economic variables characteristic of local health outcomes specific to urban areas in British Columbia, Canada. A weighted Kappa test statistic and a GIS-based Multicriteria Analysis are used to evaluate the strength of the variables selected by the MHOs. This research demonstrates that place-specific and survey-based methods of constructing deprivation indices are effective strategies for identifying spatial distributions of health and socio-economic outcomes within urban areas in British Columbia...|$|R

50|$|Responsibility for {{the public}} {{hospital}} service rests with county authorities. Counties form public hospital regions, {{each of which is}} allotted one or two larger hospitals with specialists and two to four smaller hospitals where medical treatment is practically totally paid for by the government. State-appointed <b>medical</b> <b>health</b> <b>officers,</b> responsible to the National Board of Health, are employed to advise local governments on health matters. Public health authorities have waged large-scale campaigns against tuberculosis, venereal diseases, diphtheria, and poliomyelitis. The government-paid guidance and assistance given to mothers of newborn children by public health nurses have resulted in a low infant mortality rate of 4 per 1,000 live births (2000). Medical treatment is government-paid up to school age, when government-paid school medical inspections begin. As of 1999, children up to one year of age were vaccinated against diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (99%) and measles (92%). In 2000, life expectancy at birth was 76 years for males and females. The overall death rate was 11 per 1,000 people in 1999.|$|R
