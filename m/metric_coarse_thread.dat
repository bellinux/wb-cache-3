40|$|In general, most bolt {{sizes are}} {{available}} in <b>coarse</b> and fine <b>thread</b> optiones. For example, ISO <b>metric</b> <b>coarse</b> and fine pitch series standard – ISO 724 : 1993 “General purpose metric screw threads – Basic dimensiones ” specify the dimensiones for metric threads. Which type of thread is best for a particular application is a common question. In order to give some answers to that questione this paper deals with finite element analysis of generic bolted joint in different load conditions...|$|R

50|$|<b>Coarse</b> <b>threads</b> {{are more}} {{resistant}} to stripping and cross threading because they have greater flank engagement. <b>Coarse</b> <b>threads</b> install much faster as they require fewer turns per unit length. Finer threads are stronger as they have a larger stress area for the same diameter thread. Fine threads {{are less likely to}} vibrate loose as they have a smaller helix angle and allow finer adjustment. Finer threads develop greater preload with less tightening torque.|$|R
50|$|<b>Coarse</b> <b>threads</b> {{are those}} with larger pitch (fewer threads per axial distance), and fine threads are those with smaller pitch (more threads per axial distance). <b>Coarse</b> <b>threads</b> {{have a larger}} threadform {{relative}} to screw diameter, where fine threads have a smaller threadform relative to screw diameter. This distinction is analogous to that between coarse teeth and fine teeth on a saw or file, or between coarse grit and fine grit on sandpaper.|$|R
50|$|The #6-32 UNC is a thicker screw {{with a more}} <b>coarse</b> <b>thread.</b> This {{makes it}} more {{suitable}} for fastening larger parts and thicker materials requiring increased holding strength. Its larger size and <b>coarse</b> <b>thread</b> {{make it easier to}} work with during assembly, with less risk of cross threading. The integrated flange provides greater holding strength with less risk of pull through. The hex head makes it easier to work with during assembly with powered torque screwdrivers.|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to present {{regression}} models for predicting resistance of joints made with screw and plywood members. Joint members were out of hardwood plywood that were 19 mm in thickness. Two types of screws including <b>coarse</b> and fine <b>thread</b> drywall screw with 3. 5, 4 and 5 mm in diameter and sheet metal screw with 4 and 5 mm were used. Results have shown that withdrawal resistance of screw was increased by increasing of screws, diameter and penetrating depth. Joints fabricated with <b>coarse</b> <b>thread</b> drywall screws were higher than those of fine thread drywall screws. Finally, average joint withdrawal resistance of screwed could be predicted by means of the expressions Wc= 2. 127 ×D 1. 072 ×P 0. 520 for <b>coarse</b> <b>thread</b> drywall screws and Wf= 1. 377 ×D 1. 156 ×P 0. 581 for fine thread drywall screws by taking account the diameter and penetrating depth. The difference of the observed and predicted data showed that developed models have a good correlation with actual experimental measurements...|$|R

40|$|Much of the {{improvement}} in computer performance over {{the last twenty years}} has come from faster transistors and architectural advances that increase parallelism. Historically, parallelism has been exploited either at the instruction level with a grain-sie of a single instruction or by partitioning applications into <b>coarse</b> <b>threads</b> with grain-sies of thousands of instructions. Fine-grain threads fill the parallelism gap between these extremes by enabling tasks with run lengths as small as 20 cycles. As this fine-g rain parallelism is orthogonal to ILP and <b>coarse</b> <b>threads,</b> it complements both methods and provides an opportunity for greater speedup. This paper describes the efficient communication and synchronization mechanisms implemented in the Multi-ALU Processor (MAP) chip, including a thread creation instruction, register communication, and a hardware barrier. These register-based mechanisms provide 10 times faster communication and 60 times faster synchronization than mechanisms that operate via a shared onchip cache. With a three-processor implementation of the MAP, fine-grain speedups of 1. 2 - 2. 1 are demonstrated on a suite of applications...|$|R

50|$|The {{first person}} to create a {{standard}} (in about 1841) was the English engineer Sir Joseph Whitworth. Whitworth screw sizes are still used, both for repairing old machinery and where a <b>coarser</b> <b>thread</b> than the <b>metric</b> fastener thread is required. Whitworth became British Standard Whitworth, abbreviated to BSW (BS 84:1956) and the British Standard Fine (BSF) thread was introduced in 1908 because the Whitworth <b>thread</b> was too <b>coarse</b> for some applications. The thread angle was 55°, and the depth and pitch varied with {{the diameter of the}} thread (i.e., the bigger the bolt, the <b>coarser</b> the <b>thread).</b> Spanners for Whitworth bolts are marked with the size of the bolt, not the distance across the flats of the screw head.|$|R

The properties are defined for M1.6-39 with <b>coarse</b> <b>threads</b> and M8-39 with fine threads. The diameter and pitch combinations must adhere to ISO 261 and ISO 262 and the thread tolerances must adhere to ISO 965 parts 1, 2, and 4.|$|R

50|$|The common V-thread {{standards}} (ISO 261 and Unified Thread Standard) {{include a}} coarse pitch {{and a fine}} pitch for each major diameter. For example, -13 belongs to the UNC series (Unified National Coarse) and -20 belongs to the UNF series (Unified National Fine). Similarly, ISO261 M10 (10mm (398 thou) nominal outer diameter) has a <b>coarse</b> <b>thread</b> version at 1.25mm pitch (49 thou) and a fine thread version at 1 mm (39 thou) pitch.|$|R

50|$|Lag screws (US) or {{coach screws}} (UK, Australia, and New Zealand) (also {{referred}} to as lag bolts or coach bolts, although this is a misnomer) are large wood screws. Square-headed and hex-headed lag screws are covered by ASME B18.2.1 standards, and the head is typically an external hex. A typical lag screw can range in diameter from 1/4 in to 1+1/4 in, and lengths from 1/4 to 6 in or longer, with the <b>coarse</b> <b>threads</b> of a wood-screw or sheet-metal-screw threadform (but larger).|$|R

40|$|The study {{aimed at}} {{predicting}} bending moment resistance plywood of screw (<b>coarse</b> and fine <b>threads)</b> joints using regression models. Thickness {{of the member}} was 19 mm and compared with medium density fiberboard (MDF) and particleboard with 18 mm thicknesses. Two types of screws including <b>coarse</b> and fine <b>thread</b> drywall screw with nominal diameters of 6, 8 and 10 mm and 3. 5, 4 and 5 cm length respectively and sheet metal screw with diameters of 8 and 10 and length of 4 cm were used. The {{results of the study}} have shown that bending moment resistance of screw was increased by increasing of screws diameter and penetrating depth. Screw Length was found to have a larger influence on bending moment resistance than screw diameter. Bending moment resistance with <b>coarse</b> <b>thread</b> drywall screws was higher than those of fine thread drywall screws. The highest bending moment resistance (71. 76 N. m) was observed in joints made with coarse screw which were 5 mm in diameter and 28 mm in depth of penetration. The lowest bending moment resistance (12. 08 N. m) was observed in joints having fine screw with 3. 5 mm diameter and 9 mm penetrations. Furthermore, bending moment resistance in plywood was higher than those of medium density fiberboard (MDF) and particleboard. Finally, it has been found that the ultimate bending moment resistance of plywood joint can be predicted following formula Wc = 0. 189 ×D 0. 726 ×P 0. 577 for <b>coarse</b> <b>thread</b> drywall screws and Wf = 0. 086 ×D 0. 942 ×P 0. 704 for fine ones according to diameter and penetrating depth. The analysis of variance of the experimental and predicted data showed that the developed models provide a fair approximation of actual experimental measurements...|$|R

50|$|A {{square nut}} is a four-sided nut. Compared to {{standard}} hex nuts, square nuts {{have a greater}} surface {{in contact with the}} part being fastened, and therefore provide greater resistance to loosening (though also greater resistance to tightening). They are also much less likely to become rounded-off after repeated loosening/tightening cycles. Square nuts are typically mated with square-headed bolts. Square nuts are used along with flat washers in order to avoid damage from its sharp edges and helps to increase the strength of the fastener. Square nuts can have standard, fine or <b>coarse</b> <b>threading</b> with platings of zinc yellow, plain, zinc clear, tin and cadmium, among others. Most can meet either the ASTM A194, ASTM A563, or ASTM F594 standard.|$|R
50|$|In use, {{this type}} of secure fixing enables rod {{rotation}} in both directions which is often necessary to clear blockages.
