5|$|Like other animals, fish {{suffer from}} {{diseases}} and parasites. To prevent disease {{they have a}} variety of defenses. Non-specific defenses include the skin and scales, as well as the <b>mucus</b> <b>layer</b> secreted by the epidermis that traps and inhibits the growth of microorganisms. If pathogens breach these defenses, fish can develop an inflammatory response that increases blood flow to the infected region and delivers white blood cells that attempt to destroy pathogens. Specific defenses respond to particular pathogens recognised by the fish's body, i.e., an immune response. In recent years, vaccines have become widely used in aquaculture and also with ornamental fish, for example furunculosis vaccines in farmed salmon and koi herpes virus in koi.|$|E

50|$|According to DLVO theory, {{particles}} {{are held in}} suspension by a balance of attractive and repulsive forces. This theory {{can be applied to}} the adsorption of small molecules like mucoadhesive polymers, on surfaces, like <b>mucus</b> <b>layers.</b> Particles in general experience attractive van der Waals forces that promote coagulation; in the context of adsorption, the particle and <b>mucus</b> <b>layers</b> are naturally attracted. The attractive forces between particles increases with decreasing particle size due to increasing surface-area-to-volume ratio. This increases the strength of van der Waals interactions, so smaller particles should be easier to adsorb onto mucus membranes.|$|R

40|$|Using a {{modified}} equilibrium dialysis cell {{the rate of}} diffusion of butyrate through pig colonic mucus has been compared with that through other gels and unstirred layers. Relative diffusion coefficients were calculated for each layer. Layers of 8 % polyacrylamide, and of caecal, mid-colonic and terminal colonic mucus, had coefficients that were 50 - 60 % of the apparent free diffusion coefficient for butyrate, determined using layers made up of Millipore filters alone. The apparent free diffusion coefficients for butyrate (layers of agarose or filters) were 70 % of previously determined values in the literature. This discrepancy {{can be explained by}} elements of the experimental procedure. All <b>mucus</b> <b>layers</b> differed significantly from layers of 2 % agarose and Millipore filters but were not significantly different from layers of 8 % polyacrylamide or from each other. Diffusion coefficients for butyrate in the mucus samples correlated with water content and carbohydrate content but had no relationship to protein content. The rate of diffusion of butyrate in colonic <b>mucus</b> <b>layers</b> was significantly reduced when compared with unstirred layers (P < 0. 05). Whether this has an effect on the butyrate supply to colonocytes in vitro and whether mucus in colonic disease behaves differently are subjects for further investigation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

25|$|Other {{distinctive}} characteristics {{include a}} strongly keeled caudal peduncle, highly textured skin covered in placoid scales and a <b>mucus</b> <b>layer,</b> a pointed snout—distinctly hooked in younger specimens—and a lunate caudal fin. In large individuals, the dorsal fin may flop {{to one side}} when above the surface. Colouration is highly variable (and likely dependent on observation conditions and the individual's condition): commonly, the colouring is dark brown to black or blue dorsally, fading to a dull white ventrally. The sharks are often noticeably scarred, possibly through encounters with lampreys or cookiecutter sharks. The basking shark's liver, which may account for 25% of its body weight, runs {{the entire length of}} the abdominal cavity and is thought to play a role in buoyancy regulation and long-term energy storage.|$|E
25|$|Polymeric IgA (mainly the {{secretory}} dimer) {{is produced}} by plasma cells in the lamina propria adjacent to mucosal surfaces. It binds to the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor on the basolateral surface of epithelial cells, and is taken up into the cell via endocytosis. The receptor-IgA complex passes through the cellular compartments before being secreted on the luminal surface of the epithelial cells, still attached to the receptor. Proteolysis of the receptor occurs, and the dimeric IgA molecule, along with {{a portion of the}} receptor known as the secretory component, are free to diffuse throughout the lumen. In the gut, IgA can bind to the <b>mucus</b> <b>layer</b> covering the epithelial cells. In this way, a barrier capable of neutralizing threats before they reach the epithelial cells is formed.|$|E
25|$|Mature human {{vocal folds}} are {{composed}} of layered structures which are quite different at the histological level. The topmost layer comprises stratified squamous epithelium which is bordered by ciliated pseudostratified epithelium. The inner lining surface of this squamous epithelium is covered by a <b>layer</b> of <b>mucus</b> (acting as a mucociliary clearance), which is composed of two layers: a mucinous layer and serous <b>layer.</b> Both <b>mucus</b> <b>layers</b> provide viscous and watery environment for cilia beating posteriorally and superiorly.

40|$|The luminal {{surface of}} the {{gastrointestinal}} tract is covered by a <b>mucus</b> gel <b>layer</b> that acts to protect gut epithelial cells from the harsh luminal environment. This study investigated the use of two human colonic adenocarcinoma cell lines, HT 29 -MTX-E 12 and HT 29, as a model to mimic gut epithelium with and without a <b>mucus</b> gel <b>layer.</b> The effect of adding the tea polyphenols epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and epicatechin (EC) to the cells with subsequent examination of cell morphology and viability was assessed. EGCG, at the concentrations tested, was very toxic to the HT 29 cells, but less toxic to the HT 29 -MTX-E 12 cells, suggesting that the <b>mucus</b> gel <b>layer</b> on the HT 29 -MTX-E 12 cells can protect the cells against EGCG toxicity. In contrast, EC {{had no effect on}} the viability of either the HT 29 or HT 29 -MTX-E 12 cells, suggesting that proteins within the <b>mucus</b> gel <b>layer</b> on the apical surface of gut epithelial cells may bind to the galloyl ring of EGCG. The effect of adding food-related ingredients with the ability to complex with EGCG, β-casein and maltodextrin, on cell viability was also examined. The presence of β-casein was very effective in protecting the cells against the toxicity effect of EGCG, but maltodextrin, at the concentration tested, was less effective in protecting against this toxicity. In conclusion, the results demonstrate that the <b>mucus</b> gel <b>layer</b> on HT 29 human colonic adenocarcinoma cells may protect these cells against EGCG toxicity. In addition, the data showing reduced toxicity of EC compared to that of EGCG suggest that the cytotoxic effects of high polyphenol levels may be associated with the ability of polyphenols to interact with cellular proteins and mucins...|$|R

In this Review, we examine how the spatial distribution of symbiotic bacteria among physical niches in the gut affects the development and maintenance of a resilient microbial ecosystem.

Steric effects can also hinder particle adsorption to surfaces. Entropy or disorder of a system will decrease as polymeric mucoadhesives adsorb to surfaces, which makes establishing contact between the adhesive and membrane more difficult. Adhesives with large surface groups will also experience a decrease in entropy as they approach the surface, creating repulsion.|$|R

40|$|To cause food-borne botulism, botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) in the {{gastrointestinal}} lumen must {{traverse the}} intestinal epithelial barrier.

Methods-Antral biopsy specimens were taken at endoscopy from 153 children. H pylori gastritis was evident in 45 and normal mucosa in 59. The other 49 children were studied one month after antibiotic treatment that eradicated the infection in 37 {{of them had been}} stopped.

Results-Mucus gel layer thickness was significantly decreased in children with H pyloni gastritis (90 (SD) 29) am v 120 (58),gm in controls, p < 0. 01) but returned to control values after H pyloni had been eradicated. PGE 2 generation was significantly increased in children with Hpylori gastritis (1022 (811) nglg v 641 (473) nglg in controls, p < 0. 01).
