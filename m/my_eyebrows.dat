500|$|Brezhnev's main {{passion was}} driving foreign cars {{given to him}} by leaders of state from across the world. He usually drove these between his dacha and the Kremlin with, {{according}} to historian Robert Service, flagrant disregard for public safety. When visiting the United States for a summit with Nixon in 1973 he expressed a wish to drive a Lincoln Continental which Nixon had just given him around Washington; upon being told that the Secret Service would not allow him to do this he said [...] "I will take the flag off the car, put on dark glasses, so they can't see <b>my</b> <b>eyebrows</b> and drive like any American would" [...] to which Henry Kissinger replied [...] "I have driven with you and I don't think you drive like an American!" ...|$|E
60|$|Mr Abney {{had turned}} {{to me with a}} look of hopeless bewilderment. I raised <b>my</b> <b>eyebrows.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Borthwick {{served as}} a private with the 17th (Service) Battalion of the Duke of Cambridge's Own (Middlesex Regiment) during the First World War and {{was wounded in the}} head at Delville Wood in 1916. He {{described}} his injuries in a letter to Bert Lipsham: [...] "my head has been trepanned, as the skull was knocked in. The cut extends from nearly {{the top of my head}} down to <b>my</b> <b>eyebrow.</b> It was a near thing of losing my right eye".|$|R
60|$|He had {{forbidden}} me to speak, so I {{could only}} express concurrence in the sentiments which he expressed by a slight elevation of <b>my</b> left <b>eyebrow.</b>|$|R
60|$|A look of {{surprise}} passed over his face, {{and at the}} first quiver of his <b>eyebrows</b> <b>my</b> heart turned to lead in my breast.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, winking isn't ladylike. I'll lift <b>my</b> <b>eyebrows</b> if {{any thing}} is wrong, and nod {{if you are}} all right. Now hold your {{shoulder}} straight, and take short steps, and don't shake hands if you are introduced to anyone. It isn't the thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{bad things}} are habits. And so {{are all good}} things. And it depends on us what kind our habits are going to be. I used to pucker my eyebrows--wrinkle them all up, but mamma said I must {{overcome}} that habit. She said that when <b>my</b> <b>eyebrows</b> were wrinkled it was an advertisement that my brain was wrinkled inside, and that it wasn't good to have wrinkles in the brain. And then she smoothed <b>my</b> <b>eyebrows</b> with her hand and said I must always think smooth--smooth inside, and smooth outside. And do you know, it was easy. I haven't wrinkled my brows for ever so long. I've heard about filling teeth by thinking. But I don't believe that. Neither does mamma." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{could only}} lift <b>my</b> <b>eyebrows,</b> but I desired to know before we {{separated}} {{what he had}} done with that troublesome conscience of his. [...] "I suppose you know, my dear fellow," [...] I said, [...] "that you are simply in love. That's what they happen to call your state of mind." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "If {{anyone has}} any use for my left eyebrow," [...] he said, [...] "he can have it. Colonel Ducroix, do accept <b>my</b> left <b>eyebrow!</b> It's {{the kind of}} thing that might come in useful any day," [...] and he gravely tore off one of his swarthy Assyrian brows, {{bringing}} about half his brown forehead with it, and politely offered it to the Colonel, who stood crimson and speechless with rage.|$|R
60|$|When I {{paused for}} a moment {{exhausted}} he signed gravely, with unchanged face, that though it was undeniably funny, he had not yet decided whether it was funny enough, and, taking this for encouragement, at it I went once more, till I saw his forces wavering, when I sent <b>my</b> left <b>eyebrow</b> up almost farther than I could bring it back, and with that I had him, the smile broke through the clouds.|$|R
6000|$|Well, I'll let you {{off this}} time--because I like your curly hair. [She sighs amorously.] Now for the {{delicate}} arch of <b>my</b> <b>eyebrows.</b> I don't know what I should do without this. I've got no eyebrows at all really.... Have you ever noticed that dark line under the eyes which gives such intensity to my expression? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Had any golf lately?" [...] I said to Micklethwaite, {{when the}} plates and {{the remains of}} the waiter had gone away. Golf always does Micklethwaite good except when he is {{actually}} playing. Then, I am told-- If I were Mrs. Bunting I should break off and raise <b>my</b> <b>eyebrows</b> and both hands at this point, to indicate how golf acts on Micklethwaite when he is playing.|$|E
60|$|I think I {{must have}} stepped over a {{grateful}} fairy at that moment, for who else could have reminded me so opportunely of my famous {{manipulation of the}} eyebrows, forgotten since I was in the fifth form? I alone of boys {{had been able to}} elevate and lower <b>my</b> <b>eyebrows</b> separately; when the one was climbing my forehead the other descended it, like the two buckets in the well.|$|E
5000|$|Pierce: [...] "I have a stud in my tongue, {{posts in}} my lips, rings in <b>my</b> nose and <b>eyebrows,</b> and twelve {{earrings}} on each ear. I defy anyone {{to find a}} way to attach more metal to my head." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, madam," [...] {{returned}} he, [...] "I became blind {{through a}} most surprising adventure, such as probably {{has never happened}} to anybody. After that I shaved <b>my</b> head and <b>eyebrows</b> {{and put on the}} dress in which you see me now." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{is clear}} to me that climates are {{gradually}} assimilating over a great part of the world, and that in the most miserable part of our year there is very little to choose between London and Paris, except that London is not so muddy. I have never seen dirtier or worse weather than we have had here since I returned. In desperation I went out to the Barrières last Sunday on a headlong walk, and came back with <b>my</b> very <b>eyebrows</b> smeared with mud. Georgina is usually invisible during the walking time of the day. A turned-up nose may be seen in the midst of splashes, but nothing more.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Shoot not at me again,' said he, 'unless {{you desire}} death. But lift up <b>my</b> <b>eyebrows,</b> which have fallen over my eyes, that I may see my son-in-law.' Then they arose, {{and as they}} did so Yspaddaden Penkawr took the third {{poisoned}} dart and cast it at them. And Kilweh caught it, and flung it back, and it passed through his eyeball, and {{came out on the}} other side of his head.|$|E
60|$|I {{shook hands}} with her at once. I took a chair {{opposite}} her at the table. I summoned with <b>my</b> <b>eyebrows</b> a hovering waiter. The lady was philandering with an orange ice. I ordered a crème de menthe. Her hair was reddish bronze. You could not look at it, because you could not look away from her eyes. But you were conscious of it as you are conscious of sunset while you look into the profundities of a wood at twilight.|$|E
60|$|What could I do, save {{to raise}} my {{shoulders}} in token that the matter of money was one of supreme indifference to me, and <b>my</b> <b>eyebrows</b> {{in a manner of}} doubt that M. Charles Saurez had the means wherewith to repay my valuable services? By way of a rejoinder he took out from the inner pocket of his coat a greasy letter-case, and with his exceedingly grimy fingers extracted therefrom some twenty banknotes, which a hasty glance on my part revealed as representing a couple of hundred francs.|$|E
40|$|I pull my {{heavy-duty}} {{hiking boots}} from my sweaty, dirt-laced feet. A myriad of pebbles and dirt clumps hit the floor. My hands are black. Soil is embedded beneath my nails. <b>My</b> hair and <b>eyebrows</b> are flecked with brown speckles. bits of earth are nestled between the creases of my forehead, my eyelids and my smile. If I learned anything during my two long days {{working on a}} farm, it was that I 2 ̆ 7 d leave dirty from head-to-toe...|$|R
60|$|I can {{perfectly}} recall my childish {{figure as}} I stood with endless satisfaction surveying my reflection in a looking-glass on the Christmas morning after my ninth birthday. My frock {{was of a}} fine puffed scarlet, my slippers loose at heel, to match. My hair, demurely parted in the middle, hung straight on my narrow shoulders (though I had already learned to plait it) and so framed <b>my</b> face; the <b>eyebrows</b> faintly arched (eyebrows darker and crookeder now); the nose in proportion; the lips rather narrow, and of a lively red.|$|R
60|$|On {{the road}} I caused <b>my</b> beard and <b>eyebrows</b> to be shaved, {{and put on}} a Calender's habit. I have had a long journey, but arrived this evening in the city, where I met my brother Calenders at the gate, being strangers like myself. We {{wondered}} much at one another, to see we were all blind of the same eye, but we had no leisure to discourse at length of our common calamities. We had only so much time as to come hither to implore those favours which you have been generously pleased to grant us.|$|R
60|$|In a {{few short}} words the good Abbot gave us the very points that we wished to know. But all that he said only made our task more formidable. The walls of the Abbey were forty feet high. The lower windows were barricaded, and the whole {{building}} loopholed for musketry fire. The gang preserved military discipline, and their sentries were too numerous for us to hope to take them by surprise. It was more than ever evident that a battalion of grenadiers {{and a couple of}} breaching pieces were what was needed. I raised <b>my</b> <b>eyebrows,</b> and the Bart began to whistle.|$|E
6000|$|I {{had managed}} to {{progress}} {{a little in the}} acquisition of a knowledge of her tongue, so that I knew many of the animals and reptiles by their Caspakian names, and trees and ferns and grasses. I knew the words for sea and river and cliff, for sky and sun and cloud. Yes, I was getting along finely, and then {{it occurred to me that}} I didn't know my companion's name; so I pointed to myself and said, [...] "Tom," [...] and to her and raised <b>my</b> <b>eyebrows</b> in interrogation. The girl ran her fingers into that mass of hair and looked puzzled. I repeated the action a dozen times.|$|E
60|$|Persecuted by ill-fortune, and {{stricken}} with grief, {{there seemed to}} be only one means of safety left to me. I shaved my beard and <b>my</b> <b>eyebrows,</b> and put on the dress of a calender, in which it was easy for me to travel without being known. I avoided the towns till I reached the kingdom of the famous and powerful Caliph, Haroun-al-Raschid, when I had no further reason to fear my enemies. It was my intention to come to Bagdad and to throw myself at the feet of his Highness, who would, I felt certain, be touched by my sad story, and would grant me, besides, his help and protection.|$|E
60|$|As {{soon as the}} Sultan {{recovered}} from the severe illness which had seized him {{after the death of}} the princess he sent for me and plainly, though politely, informed me that my presence would always remind him of his loss, and he begged that I would instantly quit his kingdom, and on pain of death never return to it. I was, of course, bound to obey, and not knowing what was to become of me I shaved <b>my</b> beard and <b>eyebrows</b> and put on the dress of a calender. After wandering aimlessly through several countries, I resolved to come to Bagdad and request an audience of the Commander of the Faithful.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Lettie, {{he is in}} such a {{state of}} excitement, you never knew. He took me with him to buy it—let me see it on. I think it's awfully lovely. Here, let me help you to do your hair—all in those little rolls—it will look charming. You've really got {{beautiful}} hair—there's so much life in it—it's a pity to twist it into a coil as you do. I wish my hair were a bit longer—though really, it's all the better for this fashion—don't you like it?—it's 'so chic'—I think these little puffs are just fascinating—it is rather long for them—but it will look ravishing. Really, <b>my</b> eyes, and <b>eyebrows,</b> and eyelashes are my best features, don't you think?" ...|$|R
60|$|It is {{a summer}} evening, {{down in a}} green hollow, {{at the corner of}} a wall. I meet the butcher by appointment. I am {{attended}} by a select body of our boys; the butcher, by two other butchers, a young publican, and a sweep. The preliminaries are adjusted, and the butcher and myself stand face to face. In a moment the butcher lights ten thousand candles out of <b>my</b> left <b>eyebrow.</b> In another moment, I don't know where the wall is, or where I am, or where anybody is. I hardly know which is myself and which the butcher, we are always in such a tangle and tussle, knocking about upon the trodden grass. Sometimes I see the butcher, bloody but confident; sometimes I see nothing, and sit gasping on my second's knee; sometimes I go in at the butcher madly, and cut my knuckles open against his face, without appearing to discompose him at all. At last I awake, very queer about the head, as from a giddy sleep, and see the butcher walking off, congratulated by the two other butchers and the sweep and publican, and putting on his coat as he goes; from which I augur, justly, that the victory is his.|$|R
6000|$|He {{returned}} to business after the miscarriage of this last enterprise, sprinkled me all over, legs and all, greased my hair {{in defiance of}} my protest against it, rubbed and scrubbed {{a good deal of}} it out by the roots, and combed and brushed the rest, parting it behind, and plastering the eternal inverted arch of hair down on my forehead, and then, while combing my scant eyebrows and defiling them with pomade, strung out an account of the achievements of a six-ounce black-and-tan terrier of his till I heard the whistles blow for noon, and knew I was five minutes too late for the train. Then he snatched away the towel, brushed it lightly about my face, passed his comb through <b>my</b> <b>eyebrows</b> once more, and gaily sang out [...] "Next!" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{atmosphere}} of this place, compounded of mists from the highlands and {{smoke from the}} town factories, is crushing <b>my</b> <b>eyebrows</b> as I write, and it rains as it never does rain anywhere else, and always does rain here. It is a dreadful place, though much improved and possessing a deal of public spirit. Improvement is beginning to knock the old town of Edinburgh about, here and there; but the Canongate and the most picturesque of the horrible courts and wynds {{are not to be}} easily spoiled, or made fit for the poor wretches who people them to live in. Edinburgh is so changed as to its notabilities, that I had the only three men left of the Wilson and Jeffrey time to dine with me there, last Saturday.|$|E
60|$|The doctor, by the seat, turned {{so far as}} his cramped {{position}} allowed, {{his head}} over his left shoulder, and laid his right hand upon his lips. I threw back my hat and elevated <b>my</b> <b>eyebrows</b> {{in the form of}} a question. The doctor shut his eyes and nodded his head slowly twice or thrice, beckoning me to come. I descended cautiously, and it was as the signs had told. The navvy was asleep, empty to the lowest notch; yet his hand clutched still the doctor's collar, and at the lightest movement (the doctor was really very cramped) tightened mechanically, as the hand of a sick woman tightens on that of the watcher. He had dropped, squatting almost upon his heels, and, falling lower, had dragged the doctor over to the left.|$|E
6000|$|Ever {{since our}} little {{adventure}} with the Seer at Nice, Sir Charles, who is constitutionally cautious, had {{been even more}} careful than usual about possible sharpers. And, as chance would have it, there sat just opposite us at table d'hôte at the Schweitzerhof--'tis a fad of Amelia's to dine at table d'hôte; she says she can't bear to be boxed up all day in private rooms with [...] "too much family"--a sinister-looking man with dark hair and eyes, conspicuous by his bushy overhanging <b>eyebrows.</b> <b>My</b> attention was first called to the eyebrows in question by a nice little parson who sat at our side, and who observed that they were made up of certain large and bristly hairs, which (he told us) had been traced by Darwin to our monkey ancestors. Very pleasant little fellow, this fresh-faced young parson, on his honeymoon tour with a nice wee wife, a bonnie Scotch lassie with a charming accent.|$|R
