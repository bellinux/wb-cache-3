500|$|Tanner {{became known}} as [...] "Whistler’s Mother’s Boy", [...] "The Whistling Troubador," [...] and [...] "the nation’s best-known whistler". Tanner was noted for {{the ease with which}} he hit high notes and {{performed}} trills. [...] He had the ability to whistle while triple-tonguing, and like Bing Crosby, he was able to whistle from his throat due to the <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> larynx. [...] His range was from low G to high B. [...] Professional whistler Joel Brandon has named Tanner as a [...] "top pick". Ted Weems considered Tanner's whistling so important to his band, he insured the musician's throat with Lloyd's of London for $10,000 in 1939. The policy provided payment for any medical expenses related to Tanner's possible inability to whistle and included payment to the holder if Tanner was unable to perform.|$|E

He subsequently became a featured performer as a whistler, earning [...] the nicknames [...] "Whistler’s Mother’s Boy", [...] "The Whistling Troubador," [...] and [...] "the nation’s best-known whistler".

500|$|Starting in 2001, {{the other}} members had noticed that Roe was having {{difficulty}} maintaining proper pitch in concert. Although {{they did not want}} to confront him about it for fear of [...] "bruis his ego", they eventually convinced Roe of his problems by listening to concert recordings together. Roe also consulted unsuccessfully with vocal coaches and throat doctors at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The band attempted to cover up Roe's problems by removing certain songs from concert set lists, lowering the key on others, having Truman sometimes take the lead vocal, and using pitch correction software, but even these did not fully correct the issues. Finally, they consulted vocal coach Diane Sheets, a friend of Johnson's son-in-law. She determined that Roe was over-compensating for a small degree of hearing loss typical of musicians who have performed live for long periods of time, thus tightening <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> throat and diaphragm and causing him to lose pitch. Although Roe was initially [...] "cynical" [...] toward Sheets's coaching, she was ultimately successful in restoring his voice.|$|E

At table he failed to hear the conversation about petty and ignoble things, his eager mind seeking out and following cause and effect in everything before him. In the meat on the platter he saw the shining sun and traced its energy back through all its transformations to its source a hundred million miles away, or traced its energy ahead to the moving <b>muscles</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> arms that enabled him to cut the meat, and to the brain wherewith he willed the muscles to move to cut the meat, until, with inward gaze, he saw the same sun shining in his brain.
