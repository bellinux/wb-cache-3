Recent {{technological}} advances {{have led to}} rapid progress {{in our understanding of}} diving behavior, but additional research is required into feeding behavior to determine the timing of prey ingestion, prey mass, and prey type. To achieve a comprehensive understanding of the foraging and diving behavior of these endotherms, it is essential to integrate information on feeding behavior with other data. The challenges involved in developing an appropriate research method have been addressed, and several methods have been tested and used in the field, including the stomach temperature method, the esophagus method for marine birds, the stomach temperature telemeter method for seals, and the beak <b>magnet</b> <b>sensor</b> method. In the present study, I review these methods, suggest the necessity of their further development in field studies, and propose a new practical method that involves the measurement of jaw movements underwater as an indicator of the feeding behavior of seals. 海生哺乳類と海鳥の採餌潜水行動は、近年のバイオロギングの技術の進歩によってよく理解されるようになっています。しかし捕食した獲物の大きさ、種類、その消化過程をより詳しく調べるために、さらなる手法が必要です。本論文では今までの手法を概観し、また胃温度センサーや嘴マグネットセンサーなどの新手法の必要性を述べ、野外で計測するための実用的な方法を提案します...|$|E

40|$|Monitoring the T 1 {{relaxation}} of wetland clog matter {{has previously been}} identified as a gauge of its clogged state [1]. Magnetic resonance (MR) sensors explored in other work have typically been of a bore-whole configuration, which may not be ideal in a wetland environment where the sensitive volume of the sensor may become physically clogged and therefore inoperable. This work investigates two open-geometry sensor designs and a short study is presented to determine the suitability of the sensors for monitoring the clog state of wetlands. It was shown that a bar magnet geometry has a higher stray field than that of the four magnet surface sensor also presented, leading to a prohibitively short T 2 eff. This means that the T 1 values collected are notably shorter and not useful for distinguishing between clog state for the single <b>magnet</b> <b>sensor.</b> By contrast the four magnet surface sensor has a longer T 2 eff, making it more suitable for T 1 measurements; where T 1 = 915 ± 212 ms for a very thinly clogged sample, and T 1 = 127 ± 27 ms for a heavily clogged sample. This offers a clearly resolvable difference in the T 1 values allowing the clogging state to be easily determined and making this sensor the desirable choice for long-term embedding...|$|E

40|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) {{is a phenomenon}} similar to MRI in which radio frequency signals are used to excite and manipulate atomic nuclei within a static magnetic field. Following excitation, the nuclei return to equilibrium, all the while offering valuable molecular level information pertaining to the sample. Within the last decade, the development of small and inexpensive NMR spectrometers and permanent magnet NMR sensors {{has been a significant}} focus within the NMR community. More recently, application scientists have sought practical applications for the new technologies. In this thesis, a prototype NMR apparatus consisting of a spectrometer and 3. 2 MHz permanent <b>magnet</b> <b>sensor</b> was extended to enable scientifc measurements. This involved developing radio frequency electronic circuitry for the spectrometer front-end, and electromagnetic noise shielding and temperature regulation for the magnetic sensor. Experimental results confirmed that repeatable measurements using the modified apparatus were indeed possible. The NMR apparatus was thereafter successfully used to study flow, diffusion and kiwifruit using several different experimental techniques. A significantly larger effort was then expended upon the study of T 2 relaxation in pectin model systems using pH as the adjustable parameter. The fascinating experimental results were successfully interpreted and modeled across three pH zones in terms of a proton chemical exchange model and molecular conformational changes. In addition, it was found that pectin carboxyl de-protonation was significantly less than expected. Further experiments performed upon galacturonic acid monomers, dimers and trimers appeared to further illuminate the pectin results. Future experiments are planned. Also while studying pectin solutions, an unexpected pH-dependent water transverse relaxation behavior was observed at both 3. 2 MHz and 400 MHz. The only references found in the literature were from a small publication almost 50 years ago, and a 2011 publication. Altogether, this thesis contributed to original knowledge in several ways: it showed how a low- eld apparatus and single-sided sensor could be improved and utilized for a variety of scientific measurements; it showed both experimentally and theoretically how T 2 for pectin solutions change with pH; it revealed an unexpected de-protonation limit for pectin molecules; it revealed a T 2 pH dependence for water...|$|E

Modern permanent magnets are used to provide the static magnetic field in many commercial instruments and advances in electronics, such as field programmable gate arrays, have provided lower cost console electronics for generating and detecting the pulse sequence.

40|$|Abstract—A large {{class of}} angle sensors uses a small {{permanent}} magnet {{attached to the}} rotor. The magnet is polarized perpendicularly to the axis of rotation, and a magnetic field sensor is placed ahead on the axis. The sensor circuit consists of two full bridges at 45 ◦, each having four anisotropic magneto-resistive (AMR) elements. Even though the electronic system may be calibrated to have nearly no errors like offset, nonlinearity, and mismatch, still significant angle errors may result from assembly tolerances of the <b>magnet</b> and the <b>sensor.</b> This work gives an analytical description of the angle error caused by tilts and eccentricities of <b>magnet</b> and <b>sensor</b> elements against the axis of rotation. Particular emphasis is given to worst case combinations of all tolerances. One part of the angle error can be cancelled by an optimized layout of the AMR-resistors. The remaining part {{is identical to the}} case of giant magneto-resistive (GMR) angle sensors. Errors of both AMR and GMR angle sensors are effectively reduced by identical optimization of the shape of magnets. One such optimized shape is disclosed. 1...|$|R
50|$|To measure torque, strain gages {{which are}} {{precisely}} laid along the left crank arm. These gages detect the flex of the crank arm when a downward force is applies. This force is multiplied by 9.8 m/s2 {{and the length}} of crank arm are used to determine the force applied to the pedal stroke, known as torque. To measure cadence, Stages Cycling uses an accelerometer. Housed in the circuity for the meter, this eliminated any need external <b>magnets,</b> <b>sensors,</b> cables or zip ties when measuring cadence. The accelerometer can capture multiple positions per revolution, resulting in more data. Once torque and cadence are collected they are multiplied together to determine the power of a single stroke. This number is then multiplied by 2 with the assumption that both legs produce relatively the same force. This is the key factor that allows Stages Power to exist {{on one side of the}} crank, and keeps the meter small and economical. Stages Power Meters are also equipped with Active Temperature Compensation with allows the power meter to compensate for temperature changes that would otherwise affect the stain gages and their ability to accurately measure force. This technology auto-adjusts to keep power readings accurate without the need to recalibrate and stop pedalling. To capture data the meters use ANT+ and Bluetooth protocols. This also allows the meter to be updated at any time.|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} respond to spatial {{heterogeneity}} in food abundance depends on the scale of the food distribution and the foraging scale of the forager. The aim {{of this study is to}} illustrate that a foraging scale exists, and that at larger scaled food distributions foragers benefit from the ability to subdivide a continuous (non-discrete) heterogeneous environment into profitable and non-profitable areas. We recorded search patterns of mallards Anas plathyrhynchos foraging in shallow water on cryptic prey items (millet seeds), distributed at different scales. A small magnet attached to the lower mandible allowed us to record in great detail the position and movements of the bill tip within a feeding tray underlain by <b>magnet</b> <b>sensors.</b> Instantaneous intake rate was determined in a subsequent experiment. We successfully determined the foraging scale (about 2 × 2 cm), defined as the scale above which foragers do respond (coarse scaled distribution) and below which foragers do not respond (fine scaled distribution) to spatial heterogeneity, by concentrating foraging effort within areas of high food density. A response resulted in a significantly higher intake rate, compared to a homogeneous distribution with an equal overall density. Unlike systematic search cell revisitation was common in trials, and at coarse scaled food distributions even slightly (but significantly) more frequently observed than predicted for random search. Mallards respond to food capture by restricting displacement (area restricted search) at food distributions that are considered to be clumped for the forager (large scaled coarse distributions). We argue that partitioning the environment at the foraging scale in itself could be a mechanism to concentrate foraging efforts within profitable areas, because mallard were able to respond to heterogeneity at coarse scaled food distributions even when non-clumped (i. e. without conducting area restricted search) ...|$|R

40|$|Constructed {{wetlands}} are now {{accepted as}} an environmentally friendly means of wastewater treatment however, their effectiveness can {{be limited by}} excessive clogging of the pores within the gravel matrix, making this an important parameter to monitor. It has previously been shown that the clog state can be characterised using magnetic resonance (MR) relaxation parameters with permanent <b>magnet</b> based <b>sensors.</b> One challenge with taking MR measurements over a time scale {{on the order of}} years is that seasonal temperature fluctuations will alter both the way that the sensor operates as well as the relaxation times recorded. Without an understanding of how the sensor will behave under different temperature conditions, meaningful information about the clog state cannot be successfully extracted from a wetland. This work reports the effect of temperature on a permanent <b>magnet</b> based MR <b>sensor</b> to determine if the received signal intensity is significantly compromised as a result of large temperature changes, and whether meaningful relaxation data can be extracted over the temperature range of interest. To do this, the central magnetic field of the sensor was monitored as a function of temperature, showing an expected linear relationship. Signal intensity was measured over a range of temperatures (5 °C to 44 °C) for which deterioration at high and low temperatures compared to room temperature was observed. The sensor was still operable at the extremes of this range and the reason for the signal loss has been studied and explained. Spin-lattice relaxation time measurements using the sensor at different temperatures have also been taken on a water sample and seem to agree with literature values. Further to this, measurements have been taken in an operational wetland over the course of 203 days and have shown a linear dependence with temperature as would be expected.

Variation thermal energy at the crossover leads to both an electronic and structural change, often observed as a change of colour and/or a magnetic moment. A number of research have been reported concerning the synthesis of nanoscale of SCO nanoparticles [1]. The development of these new, tailored architectures is central for the exploration of the physical properties of these materials, at the mesoscopic scale the SCO is a prototype example of mixed-valence crystals and many efforts have been done to understand charge transfer process between the iron sites. Indeed, metal-to-metal electron transfer phenomena in the complexes {{play an important role in}} the intense colors of these compounds, in their electrical conductivity, in their electrochemical properties and influences also their magnetic properties. Not surprisingly, electron transfer processes are involved in nearly all practical applications of these new functional materials, such as electrochromic windows, electrocatalytic and electroanalytical devices, molecular based <b>magnets,</b> <b>sensor,</b> display, information storage and nanophotonic devices. (ii) Up to now, the observations are essentially reduced to the simple investigation of the temperature dependence of the magnetisation or the optical absorption in a huge ensemble of nanoparticles with different degrees of size dispersion by using high sensitivity conventional measurement systems such as superconducting quantum interface device (SQUID), or by transmission electron microscopy and/or dynamical light scattering measurements. Magnetoresistive magnetometer [2] can overcome theses drawbacks. Compared to the SQUID based ultrasensitive magnetic detection systems, the magnetoresistive technology has advantages of room temperature operation, less complex instruments, and hence more portable and flexible implementation. They could be microscopic in size and sensitive to the presence of small magnetic particles when they are in close proximity. They can detect extremely weak magnetic fields, for example, the magnetic field at nano or picotesla generated by the magnetization of a single micro/nano size object. Such a magnetometer will enable and well adapt for studying the magnetic properties of a single object of SCO molecular based materials. The talk deals with optimization of novel magnetoresistive sensor to detect the spin-switching of SCO materials down to nano world and to understand of size-related spin-crossover properties. Several measurement methods to enhance the sensitivity of the magnetometer are also discussed. The final target to detect a single SCO particle will be done in collaboration among three groups by combining the forces from France and Korea researchers. [1] A. Bousseksou et al., Chem. Soc.

For these magnetoresistive sensors, the lack of resonance signals commonly encountered with cantilever-type position sensor mounting, the wide band response (DC to ≈ 100 kHz) that exceeds the capabilities of many traditional position sensors, and the small space required on the sample, make them attractive options for capturing high speed fault slip measurements in these laboratory experiments. An unanticipated observation {{of this study is}} the apparent sensitivity of this sensor to high frequency electomagnetic signals associated with fault rupture and (or) rupture propagation, which may offer new insights into the physics of earthquake faulting...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The LatinSat-A and –B {{spacecraft}} {{were launched}} into low Earth orbit in December of 2002. Built by SpaceQuest, these 11 kg microsatellites carry commercial UHF payloads. Their attitude control systems employ a novel magnetic actuator {{that can provide}} large torques while using very little power. At {{the core of the}} device is a rod of Alnico alloy, capable of storing a 13 Am 2 magnetic dipole. Copper windings around this rod connect to a high-voltage pulse generator. High power pulses can degauss or permanently reverse the polarity of the <b>magnet.</b> A hall-effect <b>sensor</b> provides magnetic field telemetry to the flight computer, and allows for closed-loop control. Once the polarity of the rod is set, no additional power is required to maintain it. Previous SpaceQuest microsatellites have used permanent magnets in their ACS to align them with the Earth’s field. These spacecraft complete two pitch rotations per orbit, so that the side that faces the Earth over the northern hemisphere faces space over the southern hemisphere. The LatinSats can degauss and then reverse their magnets each time they pass over the magnetic equator. This should allow a single side to face the Earth at all times...|$|R
40|$|In studies {{undertaken}} by {{staff of the}} PATH Program concerned with automatic vehicle control (AVC) ceramic <b>sensors</b> (<b>magnets)</b> have been placed {{at or near the}} surface of both asphalt concrete (AC) and portland cement concrete (PCC) pavements. Thus far sensors have been installed at three locations: 1) AC pavement at the Richmond Field Station (RFS); 2) AC and PCC pavement on Interstate 15 in San Diego, CA; and 3) AC and PCC pavement on Interstate 80 near Donner Summit, CA. The installations at Donner Summit have been used for the guidance of snow plows during the winter months. With increased interest in dedicated truck lanes for goods movement where vehicle guidance could have significant economic influence (1, 2, 3, 4) as well as for uses like those at Donner Summit noted above, the question arises relative to the long-term effects of these sensors on the satisfactory performance of the pavement/sensor system. Potential reductions in pavement and/or sensor performance could result from interactions between the vehicle, the sensor and the pavement as well as from environmental effects because of the embedment of a material with dissimilar thermal characteristics to that of the pavement. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a methodology {{for analysis of}} the industrial machine alignment in the production line. The level of land subsidence {{in the area of}} the industrial machine location was assessed by adopting Hall Effect Sensor (HES). A computer was used for real-time data collecting and displaying the angle of subsidence over operational period. The measurement module consists of two flat-curve permanent magnets mounted parallelly and the magnetic poles which were placed in position that can be generating the magnetic tension force. The center between two permanent <b>magnets</b> was the <b>sensor</b> namely HES placed perpendicularly to the magnetic fluxes. The permanent magnets were the moving parts which can be displaced depending on the inclined angle of land subsidence. Analysis of the relationship between the incline angle of the measurement module and the output voltage from the HES was considered from the function of subsidence angle and magnetic density on X-axis and perpendicular angle (Y-axis) with the resolution of 100 mV per degree. There were two ranges of measurement according to the angle resolution, – 20 to 20 degree at 1 degree of resolution per step and – 6 to 6 degree at 0. 01 degree of resolution per step...|$|R
