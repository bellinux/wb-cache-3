Later at Max's will reading, Steph and Tom were left Max's entire estate.|$|E

5|$|Dark Angel follows an {{original}} storyline {{that takes place}} after {{the destruction of the}} headquarters of Manticore, an organization which creates genetically-enhanced super soldiers, {{at the beginning of the}} TV series' second season. Seattle has been placed on a curfew as the I Corporation round up the escapees from Manticore. They are particularly interested in capturing super soldier <b>Max</b> Guevara. <b>Max</b> evades and fights I Corporation though the streets of Seattle as she returns to her apartment. After battling opponents in her apartment lobby, <b>Max</b> learns that her friend and flatmate Original Cindy has been captured by the sector police. After defeating the police and rescuing Original Cindy, <b>Max</b> goes to meet her friend and ally, cyber-journalist Logan Cale at his apartment.

Meanwhile, a cloaked figure murders a police officer at the scene and steals his vehicle. Logan informs <b>Max</b> that he has received an email from someone named Sylan who claims that <b>Max</b> has a twin sister. He traces the email to an I Corporation research lab named Tritech. <b>Max</b> tells Logan that Sylan was one of the child soldiers at Manticore, and that she stayed behind in order to help <b>Max</b> and eleven of her siblings escape. <b>Max</b> proceeds to Tritech to find her.|$|E

40|$|Non-cell-autonomous {{effect of}} mutant {{proteins}} expressed in glia has {{been implicated in}} several neurodegenerative disorders, whereas molecules mediating the toxicity are currently not known. We identified a novel molecule named multiple α-helix protein located at ER (<b>Maxer)</b> downregulated by mutant ataxin- 1 (Atx 1) in Bergmann glia. <b>Maxer</b> is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein interacting with CDK 5 RAP 3. <b>Maxer</b> anchors CDK 5 RAP 3 to the ER and inhibits its function of Cyclin D 1 transcription repression in the nucleus. The loss of <b>Maxer</b> eventually induces cell accumulation at G 1 phase. It was also shown that mutant Atx 1 represses <b>Maxer</b> and inhibits proliferation of Bergmann glia in vitro. Consistently, Bergmann glia are reduced in the cerebellum of mutant Atx 1 knockin mice before onset. Glutamate-aspartate transporter reduction in Bergmann glia by mutant Atx 1 and vulnerability of Purkinje cell to glutamate are both strengthened by <b>Maxer</b> knockdown in Bergmann glia, whereas <b>Maxer</b> overexpression rescues them. Collectively, {{these results suggest that}} the reduction of <b>Maxer</b> mediates functional deficiency of Bergmann glia, and might contribute to the non-cell-autonomous pathology of SCA 1...|$|R
5|$|Mad Maxs {{landscape}} {{consists of}} canyons, caves, deserts, and abandoned wastelands. The game's world {{is divided into}} several regions, with each having its own backstory and landscape. Unique landmarks and ruins can be discovered in each region. Side activities such as races, time trials, invading enemy fortresses, and eliminating enemy convoys {{can be found in}} each region. A region's threat level is lowered by completing these activities, facilitating its navigation. Each region has a boss, who can be found and defeated in their base. Some of the game's strongholds are friendly, and eliminating hostile strongholds gives <b>Max</b> additional quests and rewards. These strongholds can be upgraded, offering <b>Max</b> different benefits such as helping <b>Max</b> to collect scraps when the game is turned off, or restoring Max's health and shotgun ammo upon visits. <b>Max</b> can ascend in a hot-air balloon (permanently attached to the ground) to look for new objectives and locations. After seeing the objectives through binoculars, they are highlighted on the map. <b>Max</b> can be guided by Chumbucket in strategically completing his objectives. <b>Max</b> is accompanied by a dog companion called Dinki-Di, who can help players detect land mines. <b>Max</b> has limited climbing abilities, and objects that he can climb are highlighted in yellow.|$|E
5|$|<b>Max</b> Guevara (X5-452) is {{a fictional}} {{character}} and the protagonist of the cyberpunk science fiction television program Dark Angel. During both seasons of the series <b>Max</b> was portrayed by Jessica Alba and by Geneva Locke during childhood flashbacks. Over one thousand actresses were considered for the part of <b>Max</b> before Alba was given the role. <b>Max</b> also appears in three canonical novels based on the series {{as well as an}} apocryphal video game adaptation. Created by James Cameron and Charles H. Eglee, <b>Max</b> followed a long line of strong female characters created by Cameron, including Sarah Connor and Ellen Ripley.|$|E
5|$|<b>Max</b> Payne 2 {{allows the}} player to enable bullet time, a mode that slows time, while still {{allowing}} the player to aim in real-time, {{to give the}} player more time to determine {{what they want to}} do. In this mode, the screen's color changes to a sepia tone to act as a visual cue. When in use, the bullet time meter will decrease until it is either empty or the player disables bullet time mode. The meter will eventually increase when not in use, but can be replenished quickly by killing enemies. To simulate the bullet time effect, <b>Max</b> can also execute a shoot-dodge maneuver. When the maneuver is performed, <b>Max</b> jumps in a direction specified by the player, and although Bullet Time is activated while <b>Max</b> is in mid-air, this will not deplete the bullet time meter. The combat system has been improved for <b>Max</b> Payne 2; the player can now arm <b>Max</b> with a secondary weapon such as a grenade or Molotov cocktail, and when near an enemy, <b>Max</b> can pistol whip them. AI companions can occasionally come to Max's aid, although their deaths do not affect the gameplay or story.|$|E

5|$|<b>Max</b> Payne 2 {{uses the}} same game engine as the one used in <b>Max</b> Payne, but with several {{significant}} upgrades. Even though the game only supports DirectX 8.1, the graphics in <b>Max</b> Payne 2 mimic those generated by DirectX 9 by making optimal use of effects such as reflection, refraction, shaders, and ghosting. The developers considered one particular scene in which effects are used well: When <b>Max</b> has lucid dreams, the screen appears fuzzy and out of focus. Since <b>Max</b> Payne, the polygon count (the number of polygons rendered per frame) has been increased, which smooths out the edges of character models. In addition, characters have a much greater range of expressions. Previously, <b>Max</b> had only one expression available; in <b>Max</b> Payne 2, he often smirks and moves his eyebrows to react to different scenarios.|$|E

5|$|<b>Max</b> {{breaks through}} {{security}} at the train yard and boards the train. She locates Van Der Mescht, who initially refuses to help her. After <b>Max</b> threatens him with torture, Van Der Mescht explains that I Corporation was a rival of Manticore, and had a military contract for more aggressive genetic research. They created a 'Y' series of genetically engineered soldiers (as opposed to Manticore's 'X' series); when <b>Max</b> and Beka were born, Beka was taken by I Corporation so that the two different series could be compared. I Corporation guards ambush the room, killing Van Der Mescht before he can divulge more. I Corporation send a single soldier, a transgenic boss named Bear, to kill <b>Max.</b> Bear is defeated, and <b>Max</b> reaches the I Corporation headquarters with the train. <b>Max</b> fights {{her way to the}} upper level of the headquarters, defeating guards and the boss characters Beetle, Gekko and Bear again, before she confronts Beka. Beka reveals that she now controls the I Corporation, and has engineered a younger replacement to succeed her using the DNA that she and <b>Max</b> shares. She tries to recruit <b>Max</b> to join her and their 'younger sister' in creating a new generation of genetically engineered soldiers. <b>Max</b> refuses and Beka attacks her. After killing Beka, <b>Max</b> tries to rescue her younger sister. The cloaked figure, whose identity is never revealed, tries unsuccessfully to stop her. Logan arrives in a helicopter and rescues <b>Max</b> and her younger sister from the complex. Later, while sitting {{on the roof of the}} Space Needle, <b>Max</b> laments that knowing the truth about Beka is worse than not knowing at all, but is determined to create a positive life for herself and her younger sister. A post-credits scene shows <b>Max</b> and Original Cindy dancing in their apartment.|$|E
