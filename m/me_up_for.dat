500|$|In {{the second}} half of the 1950s Gielgud's career was in the {{doldrums}} as far as new plays were concerned. British theatre was moving away from the West End glamour of Beaumont's productions to more [...] works. Olivier had a great success in John Osborne's The Entertainer in 1957, but Gielgud was not in tune with the new wave of writers. He remained in demand as a Shakespearean, but there were few new plays suitable for him. He directed and played the lead in Coward's Nude with Violin in 1956, which was dismissed by the critics as old-fashioned, though it ran for more than a year. He made two film appearances, playing a cameo comedy scene with Coward as a prospective manservant in Michael Anderson's Around the World in 80 Days (1956), and as the father of Elizabeth Barrett Browning in Sidney Franklin's 1957 remake of The Barretts of Wimpole Street. He did not consider his performance as the tyrannical father convincing, and confessed that he undertook it only for the large fee ("it will set <b>me</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> a couple of years") and to keep him before the public in America, where he had not performed for over four years.|$|E

2500|$|With Palmer bailing on the tour, {{some critics}} {{referred}} to it as [...] "unprofessional behaviour". In Number One magazine, he hit back at the claims he joined the band for money: [...] "Firstly, I didn't need the money, and secondly the cash wasn't exactly a long time coming. It wasn't exactly an experience that set <b>me</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> retirement." [...] He also was accused of ripping off the Power Station sound for his own records. He snapped: [...] "Listen, I gave the Power Station that sound. They took it from me, not the other way around." ...|$|E

2500|$|Evans left Dynasty in 1989, {{four months}} before the series came to an end, after only {{appearing}} in six episodes of the 22-episode season. After leaving Dynasty, Evans semi-retired from acting and made only occasional television appearances. Instead, she devoted her time to fitness issues {{and set up a}} small chain of fitness centers. In the 1990s, Evans hosted infomercials for Rejuvenique, a mask for toning facial muscles. She had previously written the Linda Evans Beauty and Exercise book in 1983. She also kept in touch with Forsythe, until he died on April 1, 2010, and she was very devastated by his passing. Evans was asked when she first met Forsythe, as an unfamiliar actress, for her first speaking part, with him: Her agent [...] "signed <b>me</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> 'Bachelor Father' and John Forsythe gave me my first speaking part." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1941, she {{approached}} Harry James, offering {{to work for}} him under one condition: that she be permitted to sing more than one chorus. Although James was looking for a more jazz-oriented singer, he allowed Forrest to audition. The band voted her in and she was hired. Several decades later, Forrest explained in an interview, [...] "Harry James was wonderful. When I joined him, I said, 'There's only one condition: I don't care how much you pay me, I don't care about arrangements. The one thing I want is to start a chorus and finish it. I want to do verses, so don't put <b>me</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> a chorus {{in the middle of an}} instrumental.' He said, 'You got it,' and that was it." [...] She also told writer George T. Simon, [...] "I'll always remain grateful to Artie and Benny. But they had been featuring me more like they did a member of the band, almost like another instrumental soloist. Harry, though, gave me just the right sort of arrangement and setting that fit a singer. It wasn't just a matter of my getting up, singing a chorus, and sitting down again." [...] In his book, The Big Bands, Simon explained that Harry James constructed [...] "the arrangements around his horn and Helen's voice, establishing warmer moods by slowing down the tempo so that two, instead of the usual three or more choruses, would fill a record ...many an arrangement would build to a closing climax during Helen's vocal, so that she would emerge as its star." [...] It was with the Harry James Orchestra that Helen recorded what are arguably her most popular numbers, including [...] "I Had the Craziest Dream" [...] in 1942, and 1941's [...] "I Don't Want to Walk Without You." [...] In 1942, Helen also appeared with the Harry James Band in the Hollywood film Springtime in the Rockies, starring Betty Grable.|$|E
