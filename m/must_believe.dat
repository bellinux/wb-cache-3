5|$|Some philosophers, such as Paul Boghossian, have {{attempted}} to show that eliminativism is in some sense self-refuting, since the theory itself presupposes the existence of mental phenomena. If eliminativism is true, then the eliminativist must permit an intentional property like truth, supposing {{that in order to}} assert something one <b>must</b> <b>believe</b> it. Hence, for eliminativism to be asserted as a thesis, the eliminativist <b>must</b> <b>believe</b> that it is true; if that is the case, then there are beliefs and the eliminativist claim is false.|$|E
5|$|The story I {{am going}} to tell is a horrible one: I beg that daughters and fathers should hold {{themselves}} aloof, while I sing, or if they find my songs enchanting, let them refuse to believe this part of my tale, and suppose that it never happened: or else, if they believe that it did happen, they <b>must</b> <b>believe</b> also in the punishment that followed.|$|E
25|$|Catholics <b>must</b> <b>believe,</b> however, {{that humans}} have souls created {{immediately}} by God. Since {{the soul is}} a spiritual substance it is not brought into being through transformation of matter, but directly by God, whence the special uniqueness of each person.|$|E

25|$|In 1975, Morell was {{replaced}} by drummer Eliot Zigmund. Several collaborations followed, {{and it was not}} until 1977 that the trio was able to record an album together. Both I Will Say Goodbye (Evans' last album for Fantasy Records) and You <b>Must</b> <b>Believe</b> in Spring (for Warner Bros.) highlighted changes that would become significant in the last stage of Evans' life. A greater emphasis was placed on group improvisation and interaction, and new harmonic experiments were attempted.|$|E

25|$|His first {{consideration}} {{is that the}} existence of God has to be demonstrated philosophically, besides the theological reasons for belief, particularly if we consider to make a demonstration for the non-believers. Moreover, the believers could be accused of making a circular reasoning, when saying that we <b>must</b> <b>believe</b> in God because of the Scriptures, and in the authority of the Scriptures because they have been inspired by God. He further indicates how the very Scriptures say that the mind of man is sufficient to discover God.|$|E
25|$|Compatibilism often {{regards the}} agent free as {{virtue of their}} reason. Some {{explanations}} of free {{will focus on the}} internal causality of the mind with respect to higher-order brain processing – the interaction between conscious and unconscious brain activity. Likewise, some modern compatibilists in psychology have tried to revive traditionally accepted struggles of free will with the formation of character. Compatibilist free will has also been attributed to our natural sense of agency, where one <b>must</b> <b>believe</b> they are an agent in order to function and develop a theory of mind.|$|E
25|$|In April 1999, while Mr. Day {{was still}} Treasurer, {{he wrote a}} letter criticizing Red Deer lawyer and public school board trustee Lorne Goddard for {{representing}} a defendant who was ultimately convicted on charges of possessing child pornography. In the letter, Mr. Day suggested that Mr. Goddard's argument in court that the Canadian Constitution protected his client's right to possess child pornography implied that he himself believed that pedophiles have the right to own such materials, and that this further implies that he also <b>must</b> <b>believe</b> that teachers {{should have the right to}} pornographic images of their students.|$|E

25|$|A {{prayer of}} {{petition}} is {{a request to}} God that asks him to fulfill a need. By prayer of petition, Catholics acknowledge their dependence on God. This expression {{is not intended to}} instruct or direct God what to do, but to appeal to his goodness for the things we need; and the appeal is necessary, not because He is ignorant of our needs or sentiments, but to give definite form to our desires, to concentrate our whole attention on what we have to recommend to him, to help us appreciate our close personal relation with him. The expression need not be external or vocal; internal or mental is sufficient. The prayer of petition is at its heart an Act of Faith in that the one praying <b>must</b> <b>believe</b> first, in the existence of God; and second, that God is both willing and able to grant the petition. The Catechism states that asking forgiveness, coupled with trusting humility, should be the first movement of a prayer of petition. Jesus said to bring our every need to God in his name and assures that “whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you.” (John 16:23) Through petition one can ask for God's help with every need no matter how great or small. According to the Catechism, Christ is glorified by what we ask the Father in his name.|$|E
25|$|As Joey {{tentatively}} {{enters the}} stage space, he is {{met with a}} spontaneous ovation sparked by the immediacy of the live moment, in turn aided {{by the fact that}} Kohler and Jones never stray from the game that dictates they treat him as a live horse. This playful notion helps Joey’s creators invite the audience to believe in his aliveness, and the audience succumbs, not only for his lifelike movement, but also for the way he is activated by those around him. As both creators and performers, Jones and Kohler soothe Joey’s “nervousness,” and a planned moment when Joey “notices” the audience elicits a generous laugh. Joey shies, nervously clops his hooves, and nickers gently to demonstrate alarm. He sniffs Kohler’s jacket pocket, as he “knows” there is a snack in there. Later, when Jones crosses the stage to demonstrate a feature, he is careful not to walk behind Joey, lest he is kicked. The audience <b>must</b> <b>believe</b> he will not be kicked – only a spiteful puppeteer could activate such a trick – but Jones’s conviction that he should respect the animal’s space foregrounds the moment’s liveness and heightens the audience’s engagement. Finally, a jockey is introduced, and Joey patiently holds still while he is mounted. Joey accepts the rider’s weight without complaint, comfortably parades around the stage, and swiftly exits before the effect is mundane. For the entire time that Joey inhabits the stage, the audience is noticeably spellbound.|$|E
25|$|Emma, Mary Margaret, David, Regina, Mr. Gold, and Hook {{arrive in}} Neverland via the portal from the magic bean. Gold admonishes Emma {{for not having}} enough belief, which is {{essential}} to have {{in a place like}} Neverland, and leaves the party to search for Henry on the island himself. Emma holds Mary Margaret and David accountable for what has happened, believing that she should never have broken the curse and simply left Storybrooke with Henry. Hook commiserates with her over the loss of Neal, but their mourning is interrupted by an attack on the Jolly Roger by mermaids. Mary Margaret and Emma catch one in a net, while Regina drives the others away with fire. The makeshift crew argues among themselves {{about what to do with}} the mermaid, who summons a storm with a conch shell. The storm continues to worsen, and Regina turns the mermaid into a wooden statue. Further arguing makes Mary Margaret finally release her years of rage against Regina and the two begin assaulting each other, prompting David to attempt to break it up and get drawn into a brawl with Hook. Emma realizes that their strife is causing the storm, echoing the mermaid's warning that they would kill themselves. In order to force them to cooperate, she dives overboard and is struck by a pulley that has fallen from the ship's rigging. The plan works as everyone puts aside their differences to help David get into the water to rescue her. The storm clears up and the Jolly Roger is able to approach the island. Despite Hook's earlier plan of making their way around the island and catching the Lost Boys by surprise, Emma elects to lead the crew on a direct assault route, declaring that they <b>must</b> <b>believe</b> in each other in order for them to succeed in Neverland.|$|E

500|$|On 16 October 2013, Chen {{made his}} first public {{appearance}} {{in his role as}} a Distinguished Senior Fellow at the Witherspoon Institute. He delivered a public lecture at Princeton University entitled [...] "China and the World in the 21st Century: The Next Human Rights Revolution," [...] which was co-sponsored by the Witherspoon Institute and the James Madison Program in American Ideals and Institutions. The text of Chen's speech, translated into English, was then published online. In the speech, Chen called on the American people to support the Chinese people by fighting against the oppressive Communist government of China. He reminded the audience that even small actions undertaken in defense of human rights can have a large impact, because “Every person has infinite strength. Every action has an important impact. We <b>must</b> <b>believe</b> in the value of our own actions.” ...|$|E
500|$|On 2 August, Hitler sent a {{directive}} to Kluge ordering [...] "an immediate counter-attack between Mortain and Avranches". General Walter Warlimont—the Deputy Chief of Staff at OKW, the German armed forces headquarters—was also sent to Kluge's headquarters to ensure these orders were complied with. Kluge {{suggested that there}} was no chance of success, and the German forces in Normandy should retire to the Seine River, pivoting on the intact defences south of Caen, but on 4 August, Hitler categorically ordered the attack to be launched. He demanded that eight of the nine Panzer Divisions in Normandy be used in the attack, and that the Luftwaffe commit its entire reserve, including 1,000 fighters. According to Hitler, three qualifications had to be met for the attack to proceed. [...] "Von Kluge <b>must</b> <b>believe</b> in it. He must be able to detach enough armour from the main front in Normandy to create an effective striking force, and he must achieve surprise".|$|E

500|$|By 19:00, Franchise had {{dumped her}} {{lifeboats}} {{and a large}} quantity of guns and supplies overboard, lightening the ship {{enough for her to}} far outstrip the pursuit. As night fell the French frigate made a full escape from the British force. Médée however had not escaped. Although Bombay Castle was many miles behind, only distantly visible on the horizon, Exeter had been able to follow the frigate closely. Meriton was aware that the French warship was much stronger than his own merchant vessel, but realized that as the frigate had made no effort to fight, her commander <b>must</b> <b>believe</b> Exeter to be a ship of the line. To reinforce this image in the rapidly approaching darkness, Meriton arranged lights behind every gunport, whether or not it contained a cannon, creating an effect described as [...] "a fearsome, leering jack-o'-lantern". As his ship drew level with the French frigate, Meriton hailed the enemy's deck, calling on them to surrender. Intimidated by this large and seemingly powerful enemy, Coudin decided that his only option was to strike his flag and come aboard the British ship to surrender formally. Arriving on board, he was astonished to see far fewer and smaller guns than a warship normally carried. When Coudin asked to whom he had surrendered, Meriton is said to have replied [...] "To a merchantman". Appalled, Coudin demanded to be allowed to return to his ship and conduct a formal naval battle, but Meriton refused.|$|E
