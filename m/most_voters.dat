5|$|The Alabama Crimson Tide {{entered the}} 1998 college {{football}} season after a 1997 season {{that included a}} 47 and no bowl game. Heading into the season, the Tide were unranked nationally and were picked to finish fifth in the SEC West in the annual poll of media members who cover SEC football. <b>Most</b> <b>voters</b> expected Alabama to show little improvement over its performance in the previous year.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} of Warren's ancestry was pressed by the Brown campaign throughout the election. However, polls showed that <b>most</b> <b>voters</b> {{said that the}} controversy would not impact their vote in the election.

5|$|<b>Most</b> <b>voters</b> in Brazil had a low income. For example, in the Minas Gerais town of Formiga in 1876, {{the poor}} {{constituted}} 70% of the electorate. In Irajá {{in the province}} of Rio de Janeiro, the poor were 87% of the electorate. Former slaves could not vote, but their children and grandchildren could, as could the illiterate (which few countries allowed). In 1872, 10.8% of the Brazilian population voted (13% of the non-slave population). By comparison, electoral participation in the UK in 1870 was 7% of the total population; in Italy it was 2%; in Portugal 9%; and in the Netherlands 2.5%. In 1832, the year of the British electoral reform, 3% of the British voted. Further reforms in 1867 and 1884 expanded electoral participation in the UK to 15%.|$|E

3000|$|... {{the total}} number of votes the story has received. The {{quantity}} ρ is the probability a user is a fan of the <b>most</b> recent <b>voter,</b> conditioned on that user not having seen the story nor being a fan of any voter prior to the <b>most</b> recent <b>voter.</b> For simplicity, we treat this probability as a constant over the voters, thus averaging over the variation due to clustering in the social network and the number of fans a user has. The first term in each of these equations is the rate the users see the story. The second terms arise from the rate the story becomes visible in the friends interface of users who are not fans of previous voters but are fans of the <b>most</b> recent <b>voter.</b>|$|R
5|$|At the 2016 EU {{membership}} referendum, {{all three}} Northern England regions voted to leave, as did all English regions outside London. The largest Northern Remain vote was 60.4% in Manchester; the largest Leave vote was 69.9% in North East Lincolnshire. In total, the Leave {{vote in the}} Northern England regions was 55.9% – {{higher than in the}} Southern England regions and the other Home Nations, but lower than in the Midlands or the East of England. The Eurosceptic UK Independence Party (UKIP) positioned themselves as the main challenger to Labour in Northern constituencies, and came second in many at the 2015 general election. UKIP originally struggled in the region due to vote splitting with the far-right British National Party (BNP), who exploited racial tensions {{in the wake of the}} 2001 Bradford riots and other riots in Northern towns. In 2006, 40% of BNP voters lived in Northern England and both BNP MEPs elected at the 2009 European elections came from Northern constituencies. After 2013, BNP support in the region collapsed as <b>most</b> <b>voters</b> swung to UKIP. The Northern UKIP vote in turn collapsed following the EU referendum, with most UKIP voters returning to their former allegiances.|$|E

After earning his law degree in 1893 and practicing law for ten with his brother William, Bankhead {{was elected to the}} Alabama House of Representatives in 1903. After Alabama's grandfather clause, that disenfranchised <b>most</b> black <b>voters,</b> was declared unconstitutional, Bankhead was {{one of the authors of}} Alabama's revised voting law that effectively kept <b>most</b> black <b>voters</b> from registering, through a series of tests and poll taxes.|$|R
25|$|Both Ireland and the United Kingdom {{joined the}} European Union (then the European Communities) in 1973. However, the three Crown {{dependencies}} remain {{outside of the}} EU. In June 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum in which most voted to leave the European Union; but <b>most</b> <b>voters</b> in Northern Ireland voted that the UK should remain in the EU.|$|E
25|$|Another reason {{presented}} {{was that}} voters were given two papers with two different systems {{and a different}} design – one for the parliamentary election where voters marked a cross and one for local councils where they placed numbers, as the council elections were under the single transferable vote system. Undercutting this theory, however, {{was the fact that}} the invalid rate in the local elections was far lower despite single transferable vote being a new system for <b>most</b> <b>voters.</b>|$|E
25|$|Following his announcement, Rasmussen Reports had Barr polling at 6% {{nationwide}} against Barack Obama (42%), John McCain (38%), and Ralph Nader (4%). The study identified Barr as the Libertarian candidate, but <b>most</b> <b>voters</b> {{said they}} did not know enough about him to have an opinion of him personally. Barr's support in the poll was a net drain on Republicans; he picked up 7% of the Republican vote, 5% of the Democratic vote, and 5% of the unaffiliated vote.|$|E

25|$|From 1952 to 1964, <b>most</b> <b>voters</b> were {{registered}} Democrats, {{but the state}} voted for the Republican presidential candidate in every election except for 1964. The following year, Congress passed and President Lyndon B.

25|$|During Schröder’s time in office, {{economic}} growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 and {{gross domestic product}} shrank in 2003, while German unemployment was running at over ten percent. <b>Most</b> <b>voters</b> soon associated Schröder with the Agenda 2010 reform program, which included cuts in the social welfare system (national health insurance, unemployment payments, pensions), lowered taxes, and reformed regulations on employment and payment. He also eliminated capital gains tax {{on the sale of}} corporate stocks and thereby made the country more attractive to foreign investors.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the straw}} poll, delegates are then elected from the {{remaining}} {{participants in the}} room, as <b>most</b> <b>voters</b> leave once their vote is cast. All delegates are officially considered unbound, but media outlets either apportion delegates proportionally or apportion {{them in terms of}} winner-take-all by counties. In precincts that elect only one delegate, the delegate is chosen by majority vote and the vote must be by paper ballot. The state party strongly urges that delegates reflect the results of the preference poll, but there is no obligation that they do so.|$|E

25|$|Ease {{of voting}} {{is a factor}} in rates of turnout. In the United States and most Latin American nations, voters must go through {{separate}} voter registration procedures before they are allowed to vote. This two-step process quite clearly decreases turnout. U.S. states with no, or easier, registration requirements have larger turnouts. Other methods of improving turnout include making voting easier through more available absentee polling and improved access to polls, such as increasing the number of possible voting locations, lowering the average time voters have to spend waiting in line, or requiring companies to give workers some time off on voting day. In some areas, generally those where some polling centres are relatively inaccessible, such as India, elections often take several days. Some countries have considered Internet voting as a possible solution. In other countries, like France, voting is held on the weekend, when <b>most</b> <b>voters</b> are away from work. Therefore, the need for time off from work as a factor in voter turnout is greatly reduced.|$|E

500|$|Brownlee's {{department}} {{was responsible for}} administration of prohibition. [...] Though the policy initially enjoyed the support of most Albertans, disregard for it was sufficiently widespread that effective enforcement proved impossible. [...] The 1922 murder of Alberta Provincial Police constable Steve Lawson by bootleggers Emil Picariello and Florence Lassandro, {{for which they were}} hanged, helped turn public opinion against it. A referendum held on the issue found <b>most</b> <b>voters</b> willing to replace prohibition with government-owned liquor stores and rigidly-regulated beer parlours. And the Act was repealed. [...] The Lord's Day Act, which prohibited most commerce on Sundays, was also Brownlee's responsibility, though he had little enthusiasm for it and prosecuted only the most flagrant violations.|$|E
500|$|The GRC scheme {{has been}} criticized as {{weakening}} the candidate–voter relationship, because {{it may be more}} difficult for voters to feel that candidates actually represent them when {{there are a number of}} candidates in a team to vote for. <b>Most</b> <b>voters</b> elect MPs whom they can identify with and are better able to represent their interests. It would be much easier for voters to identify with a single candidate than with a team of, say, four individuals. Also, since there will be key vote pullers in every GRC, the unknown or unpopular candidate is [...] "dragged into Parliament on the coat-tails of the major vote-puller". This alienates the electorate from its representatives, thereby undermining the idea of representation. Since the people [...] "cannot clearly identify themselves with the candidates ... responsibility for choices cannot be ascribed to the people".|$|E
