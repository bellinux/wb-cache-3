40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the {{relations}} between cognitive maps, spatial abilities and human wayfinding, particularly {{in the context of}} traveling without the use of sight. Initially we discuss the nature of cognitive maps and the process of cognitive mapping as mechanisms for developing person to object (egocentric) and object to object (allocentric) internal representations. Imperfections in encoding either relations can introduce imperfections in representations of environments in memory. This, together with individual differences in human spatial abilities, can result in data manipulations that produce error. When information stored in long term memory is brought into working memory for purposes of decision making and choice behavior (as in route selection), the result may be the selection of an inefficient or incorrect path. We explore the connection between environmental learning and cognitive maps in the context of learning a route in two different cultural environments-Belfast (Northern Ireland) and Santa Barbara (California). Blind, vision impaired, and sighted volunteers traveled and learned routes of approximately the same length (1. 2 miles) in their respective urban environments. An initial trial was experimenter guided; three following trials were regarded as “test” trials where the participants learned the route and performed route fixing tasks including pointing between designated places, verbally describing the route after each completion, and building a model of the route using metallic strips on a <b>magnetic</b> <b>board.</b> Results indicated {{that by the end of}} the third test trial, and using the reinforcing strategies, the results of the blind or vision impaired participants could not be statistically differentiated from those of the sighted participants. This indicated that the wayfinding abilities of the three groups were equivalent in this experiment and suggested that spatial abilities were potentially the same in each group but that lack of sight interfered with putting knowledge into action...|$|E

This highly desirable but complex intervention requires workflow changes {{in order to}} be effective. Workflow is often cited by providers as the number one &# 39;pain point&# 39;. Its redesign needs to be tailored to the organizational context, current workflow, HIT system being introduced, and the resources available. Primary care practices lack the required expertise and need external assistance. Unfortunately, the current methods of using esoteric charts or software are alien to health care workers and are, therefore, perceived to be barriers. Most importantly and ironically, these do not readily educate or enable staff to inculcate a common vision, ownership, and empowerment among all stakeholders. These attributes are necessary for creating highly reliable organizations. We present a tool that addresses US Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical (ACGME) competency requirements. Of the six competencies called for by the ACGME, the two that this tool particularly addresses are &# 39;system-based practice&# 39; and &# 39;practice-based learning and continuing improvement&# 39;. This toolkit is founded on a systems engineering approach. It includes a motivational and orientation presentation, 128 magnetic pictorial and write-erase icons of 40 designs, dry-erase <b>magnetic</b> <b>board,</b> and five visual aids for reducing cognitive and emotive biases in staff.

40|$|Resumo: Em 2001 desenvolvemos um método de avaliação do senso rítmico em pessoas com surdez de severa a profunda. Neste método utilizamos um sistema de dicas visuais como forma de substituir as dicas sonoras (não perceptíveis ao surdo) que dão informação sobre o ritmo {{ambiental}} e que gerenciam a realização de um movimento no ritmo. O programa de atividades rítmicas adaptadas (P. A. R. A) foi aplicado num período de quatro meses e propunha fazer com que os sujeitos participantes fossem estimulados a perceber o ritmo ambiental (música tocada) em seu parâmetro velocidade, através do uso de dicas visuais. Eram dispostos em um quadro imantado oito imãs com o desenho de tartarugas para compreensão do ritmo lento e coelhos para a compreensão do ritmo rápido. A disposição destas figuras no quadro imantado, chamamos de estruturas. O pesquisador tocava com as mãos na estrutura (figura por figura, na ordem de 1 a 8) na velocidade do ritmo que estava presente no ambiente, solicitando aos sujeitos que realizassem movimentos previamente orientados no ritmo que estava sendo visualmente demonstrado ao grupo. Esta pesquisa revelou que o surdo que participou do P. A. R. A apresentou melhores resultados em suas performances nos parâmetros de velocidade do ritmo do que os surdos que não se utilizam do sistema de dicas visuais para compreensão do ritmo externo (ambiental). Porém, a disseminação do programa dependia da habilidade do professor na execução dos toques com a mão na estrutura dentro de um padrão rítmico, restringindo a possibilidade de levar o programa a outros surdos, dada a especificidade do conhecimento nas questões do ritmo que a pessoa que orienta o programa deveria ter. A proposta da presente pesquisa foi a de desenvolver um método que propicie ao surdo maior autonomia frente a estas questões do ritmo, onde ele mesmo visualize o ritmo externo, sem o auxílio de um intermediador, para tanto foram desenvolvidos dois softwares que tem por função mostrar ao surdo através da percepção visual e/ou da percepção tátil, qual o ritmo que está sendo tocado no ambiente como orientador de suas ações motoras rítmicas. Trata-se de uma pesquisa quase experimental com delineamento {{ex post facto}} 4 x 2 onde utilizamos um teste não paramétrico de Kruskal Wallis, para amostras independentes entre si. O objetivo era analisar a interferência dos métodos utilizados com diferentes instrumentos, nos testes do padrão rítmico na performance rítmica dos sujeitos da pesquisa. Os sujeitos foram distribuídos em quatro grupos distintos, segundo as ferramentas utilizadas no teste: G 1. Com o uso das estruturas rítmicas; G 2. Com o uso apenas das dicas visuais na interface do computador;G 3. Com o uso apenas do celular com o estímulo tátil (vibratório) e G 4. Com o uso dos dois softwares ("no computador" com a dica visual e "no celular" com o modo vibratório). Os resultados apontaram para diferenças não significativas quanto ao uso de diferentes métodos de dicas (tátil ou visual) para realização de movimentos dentro do padrão rítmico, com um p= 0, 2119 para o ritmo lento e p= 0, 2891 para o ritmo rápido com um _= 0, 05. As médias obtidas nos testes evidenciaram a eficácia do uso de dicas, sejam elas visuais ou táteis na realização dos movimentos solicitados dentro dos parâmetros de velocidade (lento e rápido) do ritmo, sugerindo a viabilidade da utilização do uso dos softwares BPM (Batidas Por Minutos) e VPM (Vibrações Por Minuto) no Programa de Atividade Rítmica Adaptada ao surdoAbstract: In 2001 {{we developed}} a method of evaluation of the rhythmic sense in people with severe and deep hearing problems. In this method we use a system of visual clues {{as a way of}} replacing sound clues (which a deaf individual cannot perceive) that provide pieces of information about the environmental rhythm and manage the performance of a movement in rhythm. The Program of Adapted Rhythmic Activities (PARA) was applied in a four months period and its aim was making the participant individuals be stimulated to perceive the environmental rhythm (played song) in its speed parameter, through the use of visual clues. In a <b>magnetic</b> <b>board</b> we placed eight magnets with turtle drawings for the understanding of slow rhythm and rabbits for the understanding of the fast rhythm. We call the disposition of these figures on the <b>magnetic</b> <b>board</b> structures. The researcher touched the structure with his hands (one by one in order from 1 to 8) in the speed of the environmental rhythm, asking the individuals to perform previously oriented movements in the rhythm that has been visually demonstrated to the group. This research showed that the deaf who participated in PARA presented better results in his performance than those who do not use the system of visual clues to comprehend the internal rhythm (environmental). However, the dissemination of the program depended on the ability of the teacher in performing hand touches in the structure within a rhythmic pattern, limiting the possibility of taking the program to other deaf, given the specificity of the knowledge in rhythmic issues that the person who oriented the program should have. The proposal of the present research was to develop a method that provides the deaf grater autonomy before these rhythmic issues, in which he himself visualize the external rhythm, without the help of a intermediary, to do so we developed two pieces of software that have the function of showing the deaf through visual and/or tactile perception which rhythm is being played in the environment as a guide for his motor rhythmic actions. This is an almost experimental research with a lay out post facto 4 x 2 in which we used a nonparametrical test from Kruskal Wallis, for independent samples among them. The aim was to analyze the interference of the method used in the tests of rhythmic pattern in the rhythmic performance of the participants of the research. The participants were distributed in four different groups, according to the tools used in the test: G 1 with the use of rhythmic structures; G 2 with the use of only a cell phone with a tactile stimulus (vibration); G 3 with the use of only visual clues in the interface of a computer and G 4 with the use of both pieces of software ("on the cell phone" with the vibration mode and "on the computer" with visual hint). The results pointed to non-significant differences regarding the use of different clues (tactile or visual) methods to perform movements within the rhythmic pattern with a p= 0, 2119 to slow rhythm and p= 0, 2891 to the fast rhythm, and _= 0, 005. The averages obtained in the test demonstrated the efficiency of the use of clues, either visual or tactile in the performance of the requested movements within the speed parameters (slow and fast) of rhythm, suggesting the viability of the use of BPM (Beats per Minute) and VPM (Vibrations per Minute) pieces of software in the Program of Adapted Rhythmic Activities for the Dea...|$|E
