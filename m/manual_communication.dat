25|$|After it was {{established}} that infants could babble {{with their hands}} and their mouths, the patterns in which productions occurred were studied. Speaking and signing infants follow very similar maturational paths in language acquisition. Both go {{through a number of}} stages, and exhibit similar complexity in their babbling sequences. In studies where deaf and hearing children were compared, children learning sign language produced more multi-movement manual babbling than children who were not learning a sign language. There are three main components of manual babbling. The hand gestures contain a restricted set of phonetic units, show a syllabic organization, and are used without reference or meaning. This is comparable to aspects of vocal babbling as mentioned above. It is difficult to study manual babbling as often the manual activity can be mistaken as gestures rather than signs. When signing children are in fact babbling it will most often take place in front of their torso in a designated area that is called the phonetic space. One of the most common forms of manual babbling is the extension and spreading of all fingers. This babble {{is also one of the}} first indicators that an infant will begin to make in <b>manual</b> <b>communication.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Sign {{language}} (also signed language) is {{a language}} which chiefly uses <b>manual</b> <b>communication</b> to convey meaning. [...] This can involve simultaneously combining hand shapes, movement and {{orientation of the}} hands, arms or body, and facial expressions to convey a speaker's ideas. [...] Sign languages often share significant similarities with their respective spoken language (such as ASL and American English); however, grammar and sentence structure may vary to encourage efficiency and fluidity in speaking. [...] Linguists consider both spoken and signed communication to be types of natural language, meaning that they evolved organically and over time. [...] Sign language {{should not be confused}} with body language, which is a kind of non-linguistic communication.|$|E
2500|$|European monks from {{at least}} the time of Bede have made use of forms of <b>manual</b> <b>communication,</b> {{including}} alphabetic gestures, {{for a number of}} reasons: communication among the monastery while observing vows of silence, administering to the ill, and as mnemonic devices. They also may have been used as ciphers for discreet or secret communication. [...] Clear antecedents of many of the manual alphabets in use today {{can be seen from the}} 16th century in books published by friars in Spain and Italy. From the same time, monks such as the Benedictine Fray Pedro Ponce de León began tutoring deaf children of wealthy patrons — in some places, literacy was a requirement for legal recognition as an heir — and the manual alphabets found a new purpose. They were originally part of the earliest known Mouth Hand Systems. The first book on deaf education, published in 1620 by Juan Pablo Bonet in Madrid, included a detailed account of the use of a manual alphabet to teach deaf students to read and speak.|$|E
