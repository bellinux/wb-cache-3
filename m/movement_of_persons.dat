5|$|On 9 February 2014, Swiss voters {{narrowly}} {{approved by}} 50.3% a ballot initiative {{launched by the}} national conservative Swiss People's Party (SVP/UDC) to restrict immigration, and thus reintroducing a quota system on the influx of foreigners. This initiative was mostly backed by rural (57.6% approvals) and suburban agglomerations (51.2% approvals), and isolated towns (51.3% approvals) of Switzerland {{as well as by}} a strong majority (69.2% approval) in the canton of Ticino, while metropolitan centres (58.5% rejection) and the French-speaking part (58.5% rejection) of Switzerland rather rejected it. Some news commentators claim that this proposal de facto contradicts the bilateral agreements on the free <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> from these respective countries.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} has established an Integration Office under the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Economic Affairs. To minimise {{the negative consequences}} of Switzerland's isolation from the rest of Europe, Bern and Brussels signed seven bilateral agreements to further liberalise trade ties. These agreements were signed in 1999 and took effect in 2001. This first series of bilateral agreements included the free <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons.</b> A second series covering nine areas was signed in 2004 and has since been ratified, which includes the Schengen Treaty and the Dublin Convention besides others. They continue to discuss further areas for cooperation.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} expansion of {{trade in services}} in recent years. However, there are numerous nontariff barriers to such trade, especially when such trade occurs through the temporary <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> the service provider to the overseas market or the <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>persons.</b> Many developing countries have significant potential for exporting many services through temporary <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> professionals, semi-skilled, and unskilled workers. The General Agreement on Trade in Services thus far has limited implications for liberalizing service trade through the <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>persons.</b> This paper suggests ways to strengthen the overall GATS framework through greater transparency and specificity in the commitments on <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>persons.</b> It also proposes the introduction of multilateral guidelines on regulations that restrict service trade through the <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>persons.</b> Introduction World trade in services has expanded considerably in recent years.

40|$|Trade in {{services}} has expanded considerably in recent years, However, numerous regulatory barriers constrain such trade, {{especially when it}} involves the temporary cross-border <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> labour, also termed, <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>persons.</b> Many developing countries {{have the potential to}} export services through cross-border <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> professional, semi-skilled and unskilled labour. The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) seeks to progressively liberalise trade {{in services}} via different modes of supply, including the <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>persons.</b> Under the first round of GATS negotiations, member countries have made sectoral and cross-sectoral commitments to promote trade in services for these different modes of supply. This paper discusses the significance of and various constraints to the <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>persons</b> in service trade. It also assesses the nature of liberalisation that has occurred in this mode of supply under GATS and notes the limited progress made in this regard. In view of the ongoing round of GATS negotiations, it suggests ways to stregthen the overall GATS framework through greater transparency and specificity in the commitments on <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>persons</b> and through the introduction of various multilateral disciplines.

25|$|Since Hungary's 2004 {{accession}} to the European Union (EU), visa restrictions for Hungarian citizens were further relaxed. Hungarians can now not only travel visa-free to any member {{state of the}} EU, but also {{have a right to}} settle there. A valid passport or identity card is sufficient for any stay shorter than three months. For periods longer than three months, a residence permit is needed. Hungarians are allowed to settle in any EU country for more than three months if they work or study there, or if they are financially self-sufficient. By virtue of the agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA), those rights also apply to Hungarians in Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. The same rights also extend to Hungarians in Switzerland {{as a result of the}} Agreement on the Free <b>Movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Persons.</b> Following the {{accession to}} the European Union in 2004 and the Schengen Area in 2007, visa requirements were also lifted by several other countries including Georgia (2005), Bosnia and Herzegovina (2005), Macedonia (2005), Colombia (2005), Moldova (2007), Botswana (2008), Taiwan (2008), Australia (2008), and Thailand (2011).|$|E
500|$|During the 1969 coup d'état {{which brought}} Siad Barre to power, the embassy was {{blockaded}} by soldiers, who prevented the <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> into {{or out of}} the compound for over 24hours. Only the ambassador managed to briefly visit the embassy en route to the Foreign Ministry, where he made a formal complaint against the embassy's blockade. In the wake of the coup, the Somalian government became patrons of the Soviet Union and China. Three days after the coup, the Peace Corps was ordered to leave within three days. This soon extended to one week, and many of the volunteers were housed in the homes of embassy staff before being evacuated by a US Air Force plane. The Foreign Assistance Act prohibited foreign assistance to nations whose ships engaged in trade with Vietnam. After Somali-flagged vessels were observed at port in Hanoi, US development assistance to Somalia was terminated. The Barre government responded by expelling the US military attaché, prohibiting local residents from visiting the embassy, and restricting travel by embassy staff to within [...] of Mogadishu. The consulate in Hargeisa was closed and the USAID program, which had more staff {{than the rest of the}} embassy, ended. However, in the late 1970s, the Soviets became patrons of Ethiopia and in the wake of the Ogaden War between Somalia and Ethiopia, Somalia turned to the West for support. The US sought access to airports and ports in Somalia in exchange for military equipment and economic aid.|$|E

40|$|While the {{liberalization}} of trade {{has been at the}} forefront of the global agenda for many decades, the <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>persons</b> remains heavily guarded. Nevertheless, restrictions on the <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>persons</b> across regions impose a cost on developing and developed economies that far exceeds that of trade restrictions on goods. This Paper uses a global CGE model to investigate the extent of these costs, by examining the effects of an increase in developed countries’ quotas on both skilled and unskilled temporary labour equivalent to 3 % of their labour forces. The results confirm that restrictions on the <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>persons</b> impose significant costs on nearly all countries (over $ 150 billion in all), and that those on unskilled labour are more burdensome than those on skilled labour.
