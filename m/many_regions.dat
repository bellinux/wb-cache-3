30|$|The {{authors have}} applied this method to {{aircraft}} detection in remote sensing images since the depth learning has higher accuracy in object detection field. But {{there are so}} <b>many</b> <b>region</b> proposals, about 2000, extracted by the RCNN algorithm [31] using the selective search [32]. Extracting features from so <b>many</b> <b>region</b> proposals using convolution network will result in very low efficiency. In addition, in the 2000 region proposals, {{only a very small}} number of them are regions of interest (RoIs), and most of the regions are background. So many negative samples in the classification will affect the detection accuracy.|$|R

5|$|The Seminole Wars {{increased}} the U.S. {{military presence in}} the Everglades, which resulted in the exploration and mapping of <b>many</b> <b>regions</b> that had not previously been recorded.

5|$|A {{large number}} of 'inscription stones' {{collected}} by King Bodawpaya are {{seen in a long}} gallery in the southeastern corner of the temple courtyard.

5|$|A {{number of}} {{traditional}} pastimes {{have emerged in}} Madagascar. Moraingy, a type of hand-to-hand combat, is a popular spectator sport in coastal regions. It is traditionally practiced by men, but women have recently begun to participate. The wrestling of zebu cattle, which is named savika or tolon-omby, is also practiced in <b>many</b> <b>regions.</b> In addition to sports, {{a wide variety of}} games are played. Among the most emblematic is fanorona, a board game widespread throughout the Highland regions. According to folk legend, the succession of King Andrianjaka after his father Ralambo was partially due to the obsession that Andrianjaka's older brother may have had with playing fanorona to the detriment of his other responsibilities.|$|E

5|$|According to the International Energy Agency, {{cellulosic}} ethanol biorefineries {{could allow}} biofuels {{to play a}} much bigger role in the future than {{organizations such as the}} IEA previously thought. Cellulosic ethanol can be made from plant matter composed primarily of inedible cellulose fibers that form the stems and branches of most plants. Crop residues (such as corn stalks, wheat straw and rice straw), wood waste, and municipal solid waste are potential sources of cellulosic biomass. Dedicated energy crops, such as switchgrass, are also promising cellulose sources that can be sustainably produced in <b>many</b> <b>regions.</b>|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its vast}} size {{and range of}} altitudes, Argentina {{possesses}} {{a wide variety of}} climatic regions, ranging from the hot subtropical region in the north to the cold subantarctic in the far south. Lying between those is the Pampas region, featuring a mild and humid climate. <b>Many</b> <b>regions</b> have different, often contrasting, microclimates. In general, Argentina has four main climate types: warm, moderate, arid, and cold in which the relief features, and the latitudinal extent of the country, determine the different varieties within the main climate types.|$|E
5|$|Excluding {{insects and}} other arthropods, 192 exotic animal species have {{established}} themselves in Florida as of 2009. More than 50 {{species of fish}} have been introduced. Early recorded species were the pike killifish (Belonesox belizanus) and oscar (Astronotus ocellatus). The extensive network of canals throughout South Florida allows many species to disperse more readily than they would under natural conditions as <b>many</b> <b>regions</b> in the Everglades go dry each year or experience extended drought periods. The overall impact of exotic fishes on the native populations and habitats is largely unknown.|$|E

5|$|Forest covers about 12.6% of the country, {{most of it}} {{designated}} for commercial production. Forested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species, which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting native species of invertebrates. Remnants of native forest can be found scattered around the island, in particular in the Killarney National Park. Natural areas require fencing to prevent over-grazing by deer and sheep that roam over uncultivated areas. Grazing in this manner {{is one of the}} main factors preventing the natural regeneration of forests across <b>many</b> <b>regions</b> of the country.|$|E
5|$|Freshwater and {{terrestrial}} molluscs appear exceptionally {{vulnerable to}} extinction. Estimates {{of the numbers}} of nonmarine molluscs vary widely, partly because <b>many</b> <b>regions</b> have not been thoroughly surveyed. There is also a shortage of specialists who can identify all the animals in any one area to species. However, in 2004 the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species included nearly 2,000 endangered nonmarine molluscs. For comparison, {{the great majority of}} mollusc species are marine, but only 41 of these appeared on the 2004 Red List. About 42% of recorded extinctions since the year 1500 are of molluscs, consisting almost entirely of nonmarine species.|$|E

Its European {{distribution}} is widespread; it is relatively common in <b>many</b> <b>regions,</b> but rare or almost absent in others. In Asia, it has been recorded from the vicinity of Dashkin in the Astore District of northern Pakistan, and as far east as China, {{where it has been}} recorded from Hebei, Jiangsu, Fujian, Guangdong and Sichuan provinces, and Korea.|$|E

5|$|Of the 22 {{species of}} {{albatross}} recognised by the IUCN, all {{are listed as}} at some level of concern; 3 species are Critically Endangered, 5 species are Endangered, 7 species are Near Threatened, and 7 species are Vulnerable. Numbers of albatrosses have declined in the past due to harvesting for feathers, but today the albatrosses are threatened by introduced species, such as rats and feral cats that attack eggs, chicks and nesting adults; by pollution; by a serious decline in fish stocks in <b>many</b> <b>regions</b> largely due to overfishing; and by longline fishing. Longline fisheries pose the greatest threat, as feeding birds are attracted to the bait, become hooked on the lines, and drown. Identified stakeholders such as governments, conservation organisations {{and people in the}} fishing industry are all working toward reducing this bycatch.|$|E
5|$|The {{cane toad}} has poison glands, and the tadpoles are highly toxic to most animals if ingested. Because of its {{voracious}} appetite, the cane toad {{has been introduced}} to <b>many</b> <b>regions</b> of the Pacific and the Caribbean islands {{as a method of}} agricultural pest control. The species derives its common name from its use against the cane beetle (Dermolepida albohirtum). The cane toad is now considered a pest and an invasive species in many of its introduced regions; of particular concern is its toxic skin, which kills many animals, both wild and domesticated. Cane toads are particularly dangerous to dogs.|$|E
5|$|The {{rebellion}} {{broke out}} in the spring or summer of 1277 in north-eastern Bulgaria where the Mongol devastation was strongest. In the summer of 1277 Ivaylo confronted and defeated a plundering Mongol unit. Another victory followed soon and by autumn all Mongols were driven out of Bulgarian territory. Having achieved what had eluded the Bulgarian arms for decades, his popularity and reputation rose quickly. Among his followers were an increasing number of nobles who were discontent with the intrigues of Empress Maria.
