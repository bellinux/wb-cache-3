25|$|A process {{similar to}} {{pasteurization}} is thermization, which uses lower temperatures to kill bacteria in milk. It allows a <b>milk</b> <b>product,</b> such as cheese, to retain {{more of the}} original taste, but thermized foods are not considered pasteurized by food regulators.|$|E

500|$|Surviving medieval recipes {{frequently}} {{call for}} flavoring {{with a number}} of sour, tart liquids. Wine, verjuice (the juice of unripe grapes or fruits) vinegar and the juices of various fruits, especially those with tart flavors, were almost universal and a hallmark of late medieval cooking. In combination with sweeteners and spices, it produced a distinctive [...] "pungeant, fruity" [...] flavor. Equally common, and used to complement the tanginess of these ingredients, were (sweet) almonds. They were used in a variety of ways: whole, shelled or unshelled, slivered, ground and, most importantly, processed into almond milk. This last type of non-dairy <b>milk</b> <b>product</b> is probably the single most common ingredient in late medieval cooking and blended the aroma of spices and sour liquids with a mild taste and creamy texture.|$|E
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{hygienic}} quality of <b>milk</b> and <b>milk</b> <b>products</b> in respect of shiga toxin producingEscherichia coli (STEC). Materials and Methods: 205 samples of raw <b>milk</b> and <b>milk</b> <b>products</b> were processed for isolation of E. coli.

50|$|Fermented <b>milk</b> <b>products,</b> {{also known}} as cultured dairy foods, cultured dairy <b>products,</b> or cultured <b>milk</b> <b>products,</b> are dairy foods that have been {{fermented}} with lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Leuconostoc. The fermentation process increases the shelf-life of the product, while enhancing the taste and improving the digestibility of milk. There is evidence that fermented <b>milk</b> <b>products</b> have been produced since around 10,000 BC.

2500|$|To {{some extent}} the Rashaida {{alleviate}} these discrepancies by processing milk {{that is not}} needed by the calf or for immediate human consumption into storable products. Unprocessed camel milk remains fit for consumption for four to five days, although its acidity increases significantly during this period. It can be processed into {{two different types of}} product with practically unlimited [...] "shelf-life" [...] by very simple procedures. Milk may be turned into butter (zibde) by shaking it in a goatskin or other container for about one hour. Through heating, zibde turns into zamin (clarified butter or ghee) which is then used as cooking fat or eaten with sorghum porridge or bread. The other <b>milk</b> <b>product</b> described by the Rashaida is madhur, made by boiling sour milk until it coagulates. The clotted substance is then drained through a piece of gauze, formed into balls and sun-dried. In this form milk stores for almost indefinite periods and can be reconstituted during droughts or the dry season by pulverizing and adding water. Since it is often held that camel milk does not lend itself to butter or cheese production, these practices of the Rashaida are noteworthy. However, because the women and smallstock are usually separated from the camel herds during the rainy season when milk yields are abundant, only a small proportion of the milk is processed.|$|E
