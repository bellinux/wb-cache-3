In Chapman's first season at the club, Arsenal claimed an {{unprecedented}} quadruple, winning the FA Premier League Cup, FA Women's Cup, FA Women's Premier League and the UEFA Women's Cup. Arsenal's assistant coach Emma Hayes described Chapman as [...] "a rock that <b>makes</b> <b>everything</b> around her better.

500|$|France stated {{his vision}} of the film was {{different}} from the other drafts, which based Bruce Banner on his [...] "amiable, nerdy genius" [...] incarnation in the 1960s. France cited inspiration from the 1980s Hulk stories which introduced Brian Banner, Bruce's abusive father who killed his mother. His script had Banner trying to create cells with regenerative capabilities in order to prove to himself that he is not like his father. However, he has anger management issues before the Hulk is even created, which <b>makes</b> <b>everything</b> worse. The [...] "Don't make me angry..." [...] line from the TV series was made into dialogue that Banner's father would say before beating his son. Elements such as the [...] "Gammasphere", Banner's tragic romance with Ross, and the black ops made it to the final film. France turned in his final drafts in late 1999-January 2000.|$|E

Producer Terry Date, known for working with Pantera, White Zombie and Deftones, was chosen by Limp Bizkit to produce Significant Other. Guitarist Wes Borland stated of Date's production, [...] "he doesn't get overly involved at the 'music' end of things. He's a producer who fools with sound and sonically <b>makes</b> <b>everything</b> perfect. He gets sounds that translate really well on tape and pretty much completely captures what we do, perfectly." [...] The band immediately began recording after the conclusion of the Family Values Tour, despite the insistence of Interscope Records that the band take a break after it.|$|E
500|$|... "Silvia" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics; {{a writer for}} Complex considered it a [...] "standout" [...] on Miike Snow. Staff reviewer Rudy Klapper of Sputnikmusic deemed it the [...] "undeniable centerpiece" [...] of Miike Snow, [...] "It's the kind of climactic tune that <b>makes</b> <b>everything</b> after it seem lesser." [...] He regarded its placement as the third track on the album as [...] "odd". Similarly, PopMatters critic John Bergstrom also described [...] "Silvia" [...] as the album's centerpiece, referring it to as [...] "stunning". Naming it a [...] "lost Duran Duran classic", Bergstrom wrote, [...] "It's so thrilling, you'll forgive the overzealous Auto-Tune." [...] The single achieved minor commercial success on charts in the United Kingdom. It entered the UK Dance Chart at number 39 in the issue dated 23 January 2010. The following week, it rose to number 32, before acquiring its peak position of number 16 in its third week. [...] "Silvia" [...] spent four weeks on the chart; its last appearance was in the issue dated 13 February 2010 at number 23.

[...] Lewis Corner of Digital Spy gave the album four stars out of five, saying that the band's trademark sound was present on the album [...] "and truth be told, we wouldn't want it any other way." [...] Mark Lepage of the Montreal Gazette praised the album, calling it [...] "one rolling, chugging, plangent epic." [...] According to Chad Grischow of IGN, Evanescence is a [...] "great album that delivers the familiar while {{keeping an eye on the}} future." [...] Rob Williams of the Winnipeg Free Press described the album as gothic nu metal and hard rock, with dramatic orchestration which <b>makes</b> <b>everything</b> sound [...] "big and alive": [...] "With so many extra bells and whistles, despair has never sounded so epic."

500|$|The lyrical {{content of}} the {{interlude}} is spare and largely revolves around Rihanna chanting, [...] "cake cake cake cake cake cake." [...] Aside from the repetitive chant of [...] "cake", the interlude consists of multiple sexual metaphors. The lyric [...] "I know you wanna bite this/ It's so enticing/ Nothing else like this, I'ma make you my bitch/ And it's not even my birthday/ But you wanna put your name on it" [...] is a metaphor referring to a vagina. Rihanna sings about the desire to have spontaneous sex. Rihanna promises her lover that she will make him do whatever she pleases, singing [...] "I'mma make you my bitch." [...] T'Cha Dunlevy of The Montreal Gazette described the lyric as a [...] "promise", with Rihanna intending to act upon her desires. The interlude ends mid-verse and mid-lyric with a fade at 1:18. Katherine St. Asaph of Popdust described the fade as [...] "ungraceful", as well as writing that it makes the track appear as {{though it is not}} finished. Upon the fade, Rihanna puts forward the line [...] "Ooh, I wanna fuck you right now." [...] Dunlevy and St. Asaph were critical of the final line, with the former labelling it as [...] "blatant", and the latter noting that [...] "cursing <b>makes</b> <b>everything</b> obvious." ...|$|E

Popjustice gave the song a positive review: [...] "It's a little bit like Gwen's 'What You Waiting For?' meets Timbaland's 'The Way I Are' meets about fifty other things... The structure's quite exciting... there is something tumultuously brilliant about Beyoncé's contribution that <b>makes</b> <b>everything</b> seem fine and as if it was the plan all along." [...] Evan Sawdey from PopMatters said that [...] "The much talked-about Beyoncé collaboration 'Telephone', which—with its double-time beat and rapid-fire verses—proves {{to be one of the}} most adrenaline-pumped songs that Gaga has yet crafted, the whole thing feeling like it's about to veer of [...] the tracks at any moment simply due to the giddy excitement shared between the two divas, easily turning it into the unquestioned highlight of The Fame Monster". Mikael Woods from Los Angeles Times felt that [...] "Telephone" [...] is [...] " [...] a carefully considered meditation on how annoying it is when a dude keeps calling you while you're throwing down at the club." [...] The New York Times Jon Caramanica commented that [...] "Video Phone" [...] and [...] "Telephone", [...] "promised a new direction, but all Beyoncé did was show up to prove she could out-Gaga Gaga, then return to her comfort zone." ...|$|E

However, female listeners soon adopted the song as an anthem and began requesting it from their local {{radio stations in}} droves, resulting in its September chart re-entry and eventual No. 1 peak. [...] "I Am Woman" [...] earned a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.

2500|$|Bruce Eder of AllMusic {{praises the}} box set for [...] "present a {{surprisingly}} rich and diverse overview of Shankar's career". Eder continues: Each disc is different enough from what came before {{so that the}} listener is constantly surprised by new discoveries, and the last disc, {{with the addition of}} the voices, is the most delightful of all, spotlighting Shankar the composer and leader as well as Shankar the instrumentalist, and offering a rich, bracing body of music that stands apart from most listeners' associations with his work from the 1960s and early 1970s. From the opening 'Vandana' it draws us into a realm of music that is so sublimely beautiful that it <b>makes</b> <b>everything</b> that has come before it, in all its bejeweled splendor, seem almost plain and pale by comparison.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{moving to}} the Southwest in 2000, DeVille {{recorded}} Horse of a Different Color in Memphis. The 1999 album, produced by Jim Dickinson, includes a chain-gang song, a cover of Fred McDowell's [...] "Going over the Hill," [...] and a cover of Andre Williams's [...] "Bacon Fat". Allmusic said about the album, [...] "Simply put, no one has this range or depth in interpreting not only styles, but also the poetics of virtually any set of lyrics. DeVille <b>makes</b> <b>everything</b> he sings believable. 'Horse of a Different Color' is the most consistent and brilliant recording of Willy DeVille's long career." [...] Horse of a Different Color was the first Willy DeVille album since 1987's Miracle to be released simultaneously in Europe and the United States. His previous five albums had been released first in Europe and picked up later, if they were picked up at all, by American record labels.|$|E

The box set also featured the previously unreleased [...] "Ta Na Tom", another piece recorded with the Music Festival personnel at Friar Park. Alan Kozlowski, who helped compile the box set, viewed the inclusion of tracks from Music Festival from India among the [...] "prizes" [...] offered by the compilation. In his review of In Celebration, Bruce Eder of AllMusic reserved especial praise for the fourth disc, which contains several of Shankar's collaborations with Harrison, writing: [...] "From the opening 'Vandana', it draws us into a realm of music that is so sublimely beautiful that it <b>makes</b> <b>everything</b> that has come before it, in all its bejeweled splendor, seem almost plain and pale by comparison." ...|$|E
2500|$|Piper espouses a {{brand of}} creationism known as [...] "Historical Creationism", and credits John Sailhamer's book Genesis Unbound to {{explaining}} the view.

[...] "In verse 1, [...] " [...] Piper said, [...] "'In the beginning he made the heavens and the earth,' he <b>makes</b> <b>everything.</b> And then you go day by day and he's preparing the land. He's not bringing new things into existence; he's preparing the land and causing things to grow and separating out water and earth.
