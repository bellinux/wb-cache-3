The numerical values for the absorption and scattering cross sections of a pure, liquid, water drop are given for drop diameters ranging up to 6 mm, and for various drop temperatures. These values were obtained through the Mie theory. For a <b>Marshall-Palmer</b> <b>distribution</b> of drop sizes, the volume absorption and scattering coefficients of rain are given for the same temperatures and microwave frequencies shown above and for contents of liquid water in the rain mass.

40|$|Early {{radar echo}} {{development}} in trade wind cumulus clouds is studied using the equivalent reflectivity factor, Ze, {{combined with the}} differential reflectivity, Zdr. The measures used for analysis are values calculated for entire, constant elevation angle sweeps through the clouds and entire volume scans, not maximum, single pulse volume values. The radar echo evolution follows fairly closely the <b>Marshall-Palmer</b> <b>distribution</b> with some scatter towards higher values of Zdr especially in the earliest stages of echo intensification, {{where some of the}} scatter is caused by size sorting. The data provide no evidence for an important role of ultra-giant aerosols in initiating coalescence, and are in strong contrast with similar data from northern Alabama, that do suggest a major role for UGA in producing several-mm-diameter raindrops that dominate the radar echo, though the amount of rainfall in the Alabama case was insignificant...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} {{efficient}} formulation is developed {{to describe the}} effects of wind speed and directionon ground level precipitation intercepted by steep mountain slopes. A 3 D rainfall field is reproduced frommeasurements of (vertical) precipitation intensity, wind speed, and wind direction. The <b>Marshall-Palmer</b> dropsize <b>distribution</b> is used to express the volumetric precipitation water content {{as a function of}} measured precipitationintensity, and raindrops are assumed to move horizontally with the measured wind speed and direction. Land topography is described using digital elevation model data, and local contributions to ground level precipitationare calculated as the interception of the obtained 3 D rainfall field by horizontal and vertical surfacesthat constitute the elemental land surface systems. The developed formulation is tested at the Acquabona andFiames mountain slopes, located in the Northern Italian Dolomites, near the town of Cortina d’Ampezzo, wheredebris flow phenomena often occur. Simulation results are corroborated, although in an indirect and approximatemanner, by field estimates of debris flow volumes delivered by the considered mountain slopes in response tomonitored storm events. Although more accurate and comprehensive validation is needed, the developed formulationappears to constitute a useful diagnostic tool for providing interpretation of storm-flow hydrographsdelivered by steep mountain slopes in response to storm precipitations affected by wind...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{study of}} this paper focuses on the power angle {{spectrum}} (PAS) of the satellite communication downlink in rain environment at millimeter-wave bands. The two-dimension angle distribution expression of the incoherent intensity of the ground receiving antenna in rain is deduced in detail. The coherent intensity is discussed according to the first-order multiple scattering approximation theory. The calculation model of PAS is given based on the coherent intensity and the incoherent intensity angle distribution. Based on the <b>Marshall-Palmer</b> raindrop size <b>distribution,</b> the raininduced attenuation coefficient γ = ρ〈σt〉, {{as well as the}} average scattering amplitude function of rain area, is calculated and discussed by Mie method; the two-dimension and the one-dimension PASs are simulated and analyzed at different incident angles for different rain rates, frequencies and polarizations. The PAS model and the simulation results given in this paper are important for the quantitative evaluation of the impacts of rain environment on MMW MIMO channel characteristics. 1...|$|R
40|$|Scattering {{parameters}} for ensembles of aspherical ice and liquid hydrometeors were calculated at Psi = 50 deg for frequencies of 37. 0, 50. 3, and 85. 6 GHz. Hydrometeors were {{assumed to be}} oblate spheroids whose semiminor axes were aligned at Psi = 0 deg. The angle of 50 deg {{is determined by the}} viewing angle of recent satellite-borne radiometers. Backscattering phase functions and extinction coefficients at Psi = 0 deg were also computed at 18. 0, 37. 0, and 85. 6 GHz to provide information for future nadir scanning radars. The hydrometeors were assumed to be characterized by <b>Marshall-Palmer</b> (1948) size <b>distributions.</b> The extended boundary condition method was used to calculate the extinction and backscattering coefficients as well as the albedo for single scattering and the asymmetry factor of the phase function. Results are fitted to simple functions of the rainfall rate. Some comparisons intended to illustrate the differences and similarities of these results with those obtained from equal volume spheres are also presented...|$|R
30|$|The {{essential}} {{difference among}} the three schemes is their treatment of the size distribution {{of the number of}} hydrometeor particles. The one-moment bulk scheme expresses this value by the <b>Marshall–Palmer</b> <b>distribution,</b> with the assumption of a constant total number of particles. By this assumption, only the mass concentration is needed to determine the size distribution. Although the two-moment bulk scheme conceptually treats the size distribution almost the same way, it differs from the one-moment bulk scheme in the assumption about the type of size distribution function and in the process of its determination. The two-moment bulk scheme assumes the generalized gamma distribution as the size distribution function, and the size distribution itself is determined not only by the mass concentration but also by the number concentration. In this sense, the two-moment bulk scheme is more sophisticated than the one-moment bulk scheme. The spectral bin scheme is an intrinsically sophisticated method compared with the others. It explicitly predicts the size distribution. To compensate for the detailed expression of size distribution, the spectral bin scheme requires about four- to fivefold larger number of prognostic variables compared with the other two schemes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract A precipitating {{convective}} cloud is simulated successfully using the Lagrangian cloud model, {{in which the}} flow field is simulated by large eddy simulation and the droplets are treated as Lagrangian particles, {{and the results are}} analyzed to investigate precipitation initiation and to examine the parameterization of cloud microphysics. It is found that raindrops appear initially near the cloud top, in which strong turbulence and broadened droplet spectrum are induced by the entrainment of dry air, but high liquid– water mixing ratio is maintained within cloud parts because of insufficient mixing. Statistical analysis of the downward vertical velocity of a droplet W reveals that the transition from cloud droplets to raindrops occurs in the range 20 lm r 100 lm, while the variation of W depends on turbulence as well as the droplet radius r. The general pattern of the raindrop size distribution is found to be consistent with the <b>Marshall–Palmer</b> <b>distribution.</b> The precipitation flux can be underestimated substantially, if the terminal velocity ws is used instead of W, but it is not sensitive to the choice of the critical droplet radius dividing cloud drops and raindrops. It is also found that precipitation starts earlier and becomes stronger if the effect of turbu-lence is included in the collection kernel. ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1987 A {{diagnostic}} modeling {{study of}} the cloud and precipitation processes, and also frontogenesis have been analyzed in a severe narrow cold-frontal rainband {{with the aid of}} a three-dimensional, diagnostic cloud model. The results of the model simulations indicate that the heavy precipitation just behind the surface cold front was associated with a low-level warm rain process driven by the severe prefrontal updraft. The precipitation well behind the leading edge of cold front resulted from the melting of graupel. The sensitivity studies for the rain water distribution indicated that the Analytical Gamma distribution may be a more suitable functional fit for the raindrop distribution as compared with the <b>Marshall-Palmer</b> <b>distribution.</b> The differential heating due to microphysical processes (condensation and evaporation) at the leading edge of the surface cold frontal region facilitated the required density contrast across the front and thus maintained the propagation of the density current. The leading edge of the cold front was also characterized by frontogenesis for levels above 0. 9 kin and frontolysis just ahead and immediately behind the cold front. The low level frontolysis indicated that buoyancy effects were almost negligible at the leading edge of the cold front. Instead the upward motion was created by mechanical lifting (pressure effects). The frontogenetical effects due to diabatic heating were quite important at the 1. 2 - 2 km levels where the peak updraft occurred...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} objective for the Dual-wavelength Ku-/Ka-band Precipitation Radar (DPR) {{that will}} be on board the Global Precipitation Measuring (GPM) core satellite, is to identify the phase state of hydrometeors along the range direction. To assess this, radar signatures are simulated in snow and rain to explore {{the relation between the}} differential frequency ratio (DFR), defined as the difference of radar reflectivity factors between Ku- and Ka-bands, and the radar reflectivity factor at Ku-band, ZKu, for different hydrometeor types. Model simulations indicate that there is clear separation between snow and rain in the ZKu-DFR plane assuming that the snow follows the Gunn-Marshall size distribution (1958) and rain follows the <b>Marshall-Palmer</b> size <b>distribution</b> (1948). In an effort to verify the simulated results, the data collected by the Airborne Second Generation Precipitation Radar (APR- 2) in the Wakasa Bay AMSR-E campaign are employed. Using the signatures of Linear Depolarization Ratio (LDR) at Ku-band, the APR- 2 data can be easily divided into the regions of snow, mixed phase and rain for stratiform storms. These results are then superimposed onto the theoretical curves computed from the model in the ZKu-DFR plane. It has been found that in 90 % of the cases, snow and rain can be distinguished if the Ku-band radar reflectivity exceeds 18 dBZ (the minimum detectable level of GPM DPR at Ku-band). This is also the case for snow and mixed-phase hydrometeors. Although snow can be easily distinguished from rain and melting hydrometeors by using Ku- and Ka-band radar, the rain and mixed-phase particles are not always separable. It is concluded that Ku- and Ka-band dual-wavelength radar might provide a potential means to identify the phase state of hydrometeors...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedLarge raindrops (greater than 2. 2 mm diameter) that strike a water surface at terminal velocity {{are capable of}} creating bubbles that radiate significant underwater acoustical energy. Previous studies have revealed positive correlation between underwater sound spectral levels during rainfall {{and the number of}} large raindrops present. Therefore, laboratory measurements have been made of the underwater sound generated by large raindrops. Using the laboratory measurements, smoothed energy density spectra for various sizes of large raindrops are determined. These spectra are then used to compute a predicted underwater sound spectrum due to rainfall for rainfall rates of 15 mm/hr and 100 mm/hr, assuming an exponential (<b>Marshall-Palmer)</b> raindrop size <b>distribution.</b> The resulting spectra are compared to underwater sound spectra measured at sea during periods with similar rainfall rates. The predicted rainfall spectra are comparable to the measured rainfall spectra. Possible reasons for differences are discussed. An inversion technique for obtaining the raindrop size distribution from the rainfall acoustical spectrum is presented. An alternate approach for obtaining the required inversion matrix is suggested for future work. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between gas transfer velocity and rain rate was investigated at NASA's Rain-Sea Interaction Facility (RSIF) using several SF, evasion experiments. During each experiment, a water tank below the rain simulator was supersaturated with SF 6, a synthetic gas, {{and the gas}} transfer velocities were calculated from the measured decrease in SF 6 concentration with time. The results from experiments with IS different rain rates (7 to 10 mm/h) and 1 of 2 drop sizes (2. 8 or 4. 2 mm diameter) confirm a significant and systematic enhancement of air-water gas exchange by rainfall. The gas transfer velocities derived from our experiment {{were related to the}} kinetic energy flux calculated from the rain rate and drop size. The relationship obtained for mono-dropsize rain at the RSIF was extrapolated to natural rain using the kinetic energy flux of natural rain calculated from the <b>Marshall-Palmer</b> raindrop size <b>distribution.</b> Results of laboratory experiments at RSIF were compared to field observations made during a tropical rainstorm in Miami, Florida and show good agreement between laboratory and field data...|$|R
40|$|By {{combining}} polarimetric radars {{of different}} frequencies, the possibility arises {{to investigate the}} behavior of backscatter and transmission of electromagnetic waves with changing frequency and to derive the microphysical cloud properties like LWC, R and N(D), using enhanced retrieval methods more precisely. A basis for this analysis is offered by the combined measurements of POLDIRAD (C-band) and the cloud radar MIRA 36 (Ka-band) during the COPS campaign on July 8, 2007. Additionally, the vertical wind and the temperature profile of the considered vertical column above the supersite Achern was determined using a doppler sodar and several soundings. The aim of this thesis is to discuss the observed different behavior of Z of the two frequency bands and to confirm its dependency on the moments of N(D). Therefor, the process of scattering was analysed, executing a simulation program based on droplet number concentration, -size and aggregate state, and furthermore developing a retrieval method utilizing {{the shape of the}} <b>Marshall-Palmer</b> <b>distribution.</b> Using a vertical profile of LWC aligned with a case study, this approach allowed the calculation of the different profiles of ZHH of both frequency bands, as well as the w_D and sigma_D. Then, the simulated profile is compared with the complementary case study advanced with w, localized melting layer, as well as polarimetric and koherent hydrometeor classification that confirm the hypothesis of a correlation between frequency specific reflectivity differences and the N(D). In summary, the differences of the reflectivity factors are due to attenuation and backscatter effects. The former depends on size and number concentration of the hydrometeors in the volume, plus the wavelength of the radar, and induces an impact integrated over the radiation path. Considering the C-Band, this effect can be neclected for a the typical size of rain (D 1 mm, considering the Ka-Band. Additionally, the different behavior is increased, affected by resonance in the Mie region at D > 2. 5 mm. The similarity of retrieval output to the complementary measurements confirm the hypothesis, that the differences of Z can be explained and quantified by measured radar variables. Because of the implemented approximations Marshall-Palmer-distribution and Mie calculations in the retrieval method, deviations to the measurements are especially expected while simulating ice particles. As a result, the scatter calculations for simulating the microphysical properties using the retrieval method, should be advanced by the T-Matrix method and by using a more capable droplet size distribution...|$|E
40|$|Precipitation {{processes}} in convective storms are potentially a major regulator of cloud feedback. An unresolved {{issue is how}} the partitioning of convective condensate between precipitation-size particles that fall out of updrafts and smaller particles that are detrained to form anvil clouds will change as the climate warms. Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) observations of tropical oceanic convective storms indicate higher precipitation efficiency at warmer sea surface temperature (SST) but also suggest that cumulus anvil sizes, albedos, and ice water paths become insensitive to warming at high temperatures. International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) data show that instantaneous cirrus and deep convective cloud fractions are positively correlated and increase with SST except at the highest tempera-tures, but are sensitive to variations in large-scale vertical velocity. A simple conceptual model based on a <b>Marshall–Palmer</b> drop size <b>distribution,</b> empirical terminal velocity–particle size relationships, and assumed cumulus updraft speeds reproduces the observed tendency for detrained condensate to approach a limiting value at high SST. These {{results suggest that the}} climatic behavior of observed tropical convective clouds is intermediate between the extremes required to support the thermostat and adaptive iris hypotheses. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, forward {{radiative}} transfer simulations {{are carried out}} for the tropical cyclone Fanoos that hit the coast off south India in December 2005. The in-house radiative transfer package {{used for this study}} employs the doubling and adding method to calculate radiances leaving the top of the one dimensional precipitating atmosphere. The particle drop size distribution is assumed to follow a modified gamma distribution in respect of the cloud liquid water and cloud ice water con-tent. For precipitation, the <b>Marshall–Palmer</b> particle size <b>distribution</b> is used. All the hydrometeor particles are assumed to be spherical and Lorentz Mie theory is used to evaluate the interaction parameters like absorption, scattering coefficients and polarized scattering matrix. In order to val-idate the drop size distributions and interaction parameter calculations, the simulated brightness temperatures are compared with the TMI measured brightness temperatures for all the channels. For carrying out this exercise, vertical hydrometeors retrieved by TMI are used as input. The dif-ferences between simulated and measured brightness temperatures are found to be within ± 10 %. The maximum difference in the brightness temperatures between the present work and the Edding-ton model which the TRMM algorithm employs is about 4. 5 K. This may become significant when retrieval of precipitation is attempted by combining the forward model with a suitable retrieval strategy, under tropical conditions. 1...|$|R
