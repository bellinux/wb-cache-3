To determine the multiple decomposition mechanisms of this environmental pollutant, heterogeneous Fe 0 -catalyst was compared with a homogenous iron catalyst and different photocatalytic systems with UV radiation and solar light were studied. In addition, the influence of H 2 O 2 addition profile was assessed to optimize of the reagent dose and reaction time. Complete removal of 1, 4 -dioxane and 85 % mineralization of TOC were achieved by UV photo-Fenton with Fe 0, while solar light could work as cost-effective alternative, achieving 65 % removal of 1, 4 -dioxane. Although constant addition of H 2 O 2 was crucial for the rapid oxidation of organic matter, significant degradation was reached by {{only half of the}} stoichiometric amount of H 2 O 2.

Testes were also obtained from normal immature rats (aged 5, 14, 16, 21, 28, 31, 35, 38, and 45 days). After microwave antigen retrieval, immunohistochemistry was performed using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Novocastra) raised against a peptide unique to the N-terminal region of the AR and detection with biotinylated swine antirabbit immunoglobulin G, avidin-biotin complex/alkaline phosphatase, and nitroblue tetrazolium salt (NBT) / 5 bromo- 4 -chloro- 3 -indolylphosphate (BCIP) substrate. In adults, nuclear immunostaining of Sertoli cells (SC) increased progressively in intensity from stages II through VII of the spermatogenic cycle, and then declined precipitously during stage VIII to become barely detectable in stages IX-XIII. Prominent AR immunostaining was also evident in peritubular myoid cells, arterioles, and interstitial cells; staining in these cells did not vary with the stage of the cycle of the adjacent tubules. EDS caused a severe loss of AR immunostaining in all cell types. Replacement of T in EDS-treated animals resulted in a pattern of AR immunostaining comparable to that in controls, although staining intensity was reduced. <b>Methoxyacetic</b> <b>acid</b> administration did not affect the pattern of AR staining. In immature rats, peritubular myoid cell immunostaining was prominent from day 5; SC staining was detectable on day 5, increased in intensity with age, and became stage dependent between days 21 - 35. The following conclusions were reached. 1) Immunohistochemically detectable AR expression in SC occurs predominantly in stages II-VII of the spermatogenic cycle, with highest levels at stage VII. 2) AR immunostaining is also prominent in peritubular myoid cells, arterioles, and Leydig cells (but not in germ cells), but is unrelated to the stage of adjacent tubules. 3) Endogenous T and/or its metabolites control the expression of AR in the testis. 4) AR immunostaining is detectable by day 5 of age and becomes stage specific in SC between days 21 - 35. ...|$|E

In this study, we found that AMPA and MAA inhibited cell growth in prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, C 4 - 2 B, PC- 3 and DU- 145) through induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G 1 phase. Importantly, the AMPA-induced apoptosis was potentiated with the addition of MAA, which was due to downregulation of the anti-apoptotic gene baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis protein repeat containing 2 (BIRC 2), leading to activation of caspases 7 and 3. These results demonstrate that the combination of AMPA and MAA can promote the apoptosis of prostate cancer cells, suggesting that they can be used as potential therapeutic drugs in the treatment of prostate cancer...|$|E
40|$|Bcl-w, a prosurvival {{member of}} the Bcl- 2 family, is {{essential}} for spermatogenesis. However, the mechanisms by which Bcl-w participates in the regulation of apoptosis in the testis are largely unknown. To explore the potential role of Bcl-w in the regulation of apoptosis in the testis, the expression of Bcl-w mRNA and protein during testicular development and spermatogenesis, the dimerization with the proapoptosis members of the Bcl- 2 family, and the responses to hormonal stimulation in vitro and apoptosis-inducing signals in vivo were investigated. Both Bcl-w mRNA and protein were detected in Sertoli cells, spermatogonia, and spermatocytes, {{as well as in}} Leydig cells. The steadystate levels of Bcl-w mRNA and protein were much higher in Sertoli cells than in spermatogonia and spermatocytes. In the adult rat testis, both Bcl-w mRNA and protein in Sertoli cells displayed a stage-specific expression pattern. Bcl-w could form complexes with Bax and Bak but not with Bad. Bax and Bak were immunohistochemically localized to the same cell types as Bcl-w, but with higher expression levels in spermatocytes and spermatogonia than in Sertoli cells. FSH could upregulate Bcl-w mRNA levels in the seminiferous tubules cultured in vitro, whereas no effect was observed when testosterone was applied.

40|$|The glycol ethers 2 -methoxyethanol (2 -ME) and 2 -ethoxyethanol (2 -EE) prolong {{gestation}} in rodents. Because gap junctions in the myometrium likely facilitate parturition, {{the present}} study examined inhibition of gap junctional communication by 2 -ME and 2 -EE in myometrial smooth-muscle cell cultures. To measure gap junctional communication, the fluorescent dye Lucifer yellow was injected into cultured cells and {{the transfer of the}} dye to adjacent cells was scored with epifluorescence microscopy. The data are presented as the percentage of cells adjacent to the microinjected cell that exhibited dye following microinjection. A 30 min treatment with 32 or 63 mmol/L 2 -ME decreased dye transfer to 71 % and 63 %, respectively (p≤ 0. 05; control 90 %). Similarly, 2 -EE inhibited dye transfer, although myometrial cells were less sensitive to 2 -EE compared to 2 -ME. Dye transfer returned to control levels after 2 h in the continued presence of 2 -ME. The primary metabolite of 2 -ME, <b>methoxyacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (MAA), had no effect on dye transfer at concentrations equimolar to 2 -ME. Because 2 -ME and 2 -EE inhibited gap junctional communication only at high concentrations and because the inhibition reversed in the continued presence of the compounds, it is suggested that glycol ethers delay parturition by a mechanism independent of a direct action on myometrial gap junctions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Optimal {{androgen}} signaling {{is critical}} for testicular development and spermatogenesis. <b>Methoxyacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (MAA), the primary active metabolite of the industrial chemical ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, disrupts spermatogenesis and causes testicular atrophy. Transcriptional trans -activation {{studies have indicated that}} MAA can enhance androgen receptor activity, however, whether MAA actually impacts the expression of androgen-responsive genes in vivo, and which genes might be affected is not known. Methods A mouse TM 3 Leydig cell line that stably expresses androgen receptor (TM 3 -AR) was prepared and analyzed by transcriptional profiling to identify target gene interactions between MAA and testosterone on a global scale. Results MAA is shown to have widespread effects on androgen-responsive genes, affecting processes ranging from apoptosis to ion transport, cell adhesion, phosphorylation and transcription, with MAA able to enhance, as well as antagonize, androgenic responses. Moreover, testosterone is shown to exert both positive and negative effects on MAA gene responses. Motif analysis indicated that binding sites for FOX, HOX, LEF/TCF, STAT 5 and MEF 2 family transcription factors are among the most highly enriched in genes regulated by testosterone and MAA. Notably, 65 FOXO targets were repressed by testosterone or showed repression enhanced by MAA with testosterone; these include 16 genes associated with developmental processes, six of which are Hox genes. Conclusions These findings highlight the complex interactions between testosterone and MAA, and provide insight into the effects of MAA exposure on androgen-dependent processes in a Leydig cell model. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{embryonic}} stem cell test (EST) has been proposed as an in vitro assay that might reduce animal experimentation in regulatory developmental toxicology. So far, evaluation of the EST was not performed using compounds within distinct chemical classes. Evaluation within a distinct class of chemically related compounds can define {{the usefulness of the}} assay for the chemical class tested. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the relative sensitivity of the EST for a selected series of homologous compounds and to compare the data to the relative developmental toxicity of the compounds in vivo. To this end a series of proximate developmentally toxic glycol ether alkoxy acid metabolites was tested in the EST. All glycol ether alkoxy acid metabolites tested showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of cardiomyocyte differentiation at noncytotoxic concentrations, with <b>methoxyacetic</b> <b>acid</b> as the most potent compound followed by ethoxyacetic acid, butoxyacetic acid, and phenoxyacetic acid, respectively. The potency ranking of the compounds in the EST corresponds with the available in vivo data. The relative differences between the potencies of the compounds appeared more pronounced in the in vivo studies than in the EST. A possible explanation for this discrepancy could be the difference in the kinetics of the compounds in vivo as compared with their in vitro kinetics. This study illustrates that the EST can be used to set priorities for developmental toxicity testing within classes of related compound...|$|E
40|$|Embryonic {{stem cells}} (ESC) {{are widely used}} to study {{embryonic}} development and to identify developmental toxicants. Particularly, the embryonic stem cell test (EST) is well known as in vitro model to identify developmental toxicants. Although {{it is clear that}} energy metabolism plays a crucial role in embryonic development, the modulation of energy metabolism in in vitro models, such as the EST, is not yet described. The present study is among the first studies that analyses whole genome expression data to specifically characterize metabolic changes upon ESC early differentiation. Our transcriptomic analyses showed activation of glycolysis, truncated activation of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, activation of lipid synthesis, as well as activation of glutaminolysis during the early phase of ESC differentiation. Taken together, this energy metabolism profile points towards energy metabolism reprogramming in the provision of metabolites for biosynthesis of cellular constituents. Next, we defined a gene set that describes this energy metabolism profile. We showed that this gene set could be successfully applied in the EST to identify developmental toxicants known to modulate cellular biosynthesis (5 -fluorouracil and <b>methoxyacetic</b> <b>acid),</b> while other developmental toxicants or the negative control did not modulate the expression of this gene set. Our description of dynamic changes in energy metabolism during early ESC differentiation, as well as specific identification of developmental toxicants modulating energy metabolism, is an important step forward in the definition of the applicability domain of the EST. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: Glycol ethers (GE) are oxygenated {{solvents}} frequently {{found in}} occupational and consumer products. Some {{of them are}} well-known testicular and developmental animal toxicants. This study aims to evaluate the risk of male genital anomalies in association with prenatal exposure to GE using urinary biomarkers of exposure. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study nested in two joint mother-child cohorts (5303 pregnant women). Cases of cryptorchidism and hypospadias were identified at birth and confirmed during a 2 -year follow-up period (n= 14 [*]cryptorchidism and n= 15 hypospadias). Each case was matched to three randomly selected controls within the cohorts for region of inclusion and gestational age at urine sampling. Concentrations of five GE acidic metabolites were measured in spot maternal urine samples collected during pregnancy. ORs were estimated with multivariate conditional logistic regressions including a Firth's penalisation. RESULTS: Detection rates of urinary GE metabolites ranged from 8 % to 93 %[*]and only two were sufficiently detected (> 33 %) in each cohort to be studied: <b>methoxyacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (MAA) and phenoxyacetic acid (PhAA). A significantly higher risk of hypospadias {{was associated with the}} highest tertile of exposure to MAA: OR (95 % CI) 4. 5 (1. 4 to 23. 4). No association were observed with urinary concentration of PhAA, nor with the risk of cryptorchidism. CONCLUSIONS: In view of the toxicological plausibility of our results, this study, despite its small sample size, raises concern about the potential developmental toxicity of MAA on the male genital system and calls for thorough identification of current sources of exposure to MAA...|$|E
40|$|Rat postimplantation whole-embryo culture (WEC) is a {{promising}} alternative {{test for the}} assessment of developmental toxicity. Toxicogenomic-based approaches may improve the predictive ability of the WEC model by providing a means to identify compound-specific mechanistic responses associated with embryotoxicity in vivo. Furthermore, alterations in gene expression may serve as a sensitive, objective, and robust marker, which precedes the observation of classical developmental toxicity endpoints in time. In this study, in combination with morphological developmental assessments, we studied transcriptomic responses associated with four distinct teratogens (caffeine [CAF], methylmercury [MM], monobutyl phthalate, and <b>methoxyacetic</b> <b>acid)</b> after 4 h of exposure, well before apparent embryotoxicity in WEC. We evaluated gene expression changes associated with similar levels of induced morphological embryotoxicity for each teratogen (as determined by total morphological score), evaluating for functional enrichment and quantitative changes in response. Concentrations selected {{for each of the four}} teratogens used induced a number of common effects on embryonic development (neural tube closure and optic/otic system). Despite inducing common morphological effects, our analysis suggests limited overlap in terms of toxicogenomic response at the gene expression level and at the level of biological processes across all four test chemicals. Many unique responses associated with each chemical correlated with previously hypothesized modes of developmental toxicity. For example, alterations in developmental signaling and cholesterol metabolism were observed with MM and CAF, respectively. This initial study suggests that distinct chemically induced toxicogenomic responses precede morphological effects in WEC and that these responses are relevant with mechanisms of toxicity previously observed in vivo...|$|E
