5|$|Molstad wrote a third novel, Independence Day: War in the Desert in July 1999. Set in Saudi Arabia on July 3, it {{centers around}} Captain Cummins and Colonel Thompson, the two Royal Air Force {{officers}} seen receiving the <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> {{message in the}} film.|$|E
5|$|Radio {{operator}} James Fort {{attempted to}} contact headquarters on the SCR-284 radio {{mounted on a}} jeep by the command post and found that German martial music jammed the channel. He then used a side-channel and <b>Morse</b> <b>code,</b> hoping the Germans weren't listening, to send a status report to regimental headquarters.|$|E
5000|$|In 1844, Samuel Morse {{sent the}} first <b>Morse</b> <b>coded</b> message - which read [...] "?" [...] - from this room.|$|R
5000|$|The first airways to be {{delineated}} by radiofrequency {{were based}} on the old A-N system. The pilot listened for the stronger of the <b>Morse</b> <b>codes</b> transmitters ("· -" [...] for A and [...] "- ·" [...] for N) (indicating left or right of the course); the objective was to be centered on course hearing a steady tone (the A and N <b>Morse</b> <b>codes</b> merge to form a steady tone when the receiver is equidistant from both transmitters).|$|R
50|$|In Indonesia, one {{mnemonics}} commonly {{taught in}} scouting method to remember <b>Morse</b> <b>codes</b> lies in remembering words that begin with each appropriate letter and substituting the o vowel for every dash and other vowels (a, i, u, and e) for every dot.|$|R
5|$|The Amateur Wireless Telegraph Station Licence, Restricted licence {{requires}} the same scores {{as the old}} term Grade II.The minimum age is 12 years. The licence allows the user to make radiotelegraphy (<b>Morse</b> <b>code)</b> and radiotelephony transmission in 12 frequency bands. The maximum power allowed is 100W.|$|E
5|$|During swim class, Kenny, {{his older}} brother, {{and their friends}} ambush Owen and begin to drown him, only to be dismembered by Abby. The next day, Owen leaves town on a train, {{traveling}} with a large trunk. From inside, a message in <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> is tapped out. Owen smiles and taps out a response.|$|E
5|$|In July 1938, McKenzie {{was one of}} 80 {{women in}} {{attendance}} at the inaugural meeting of the Australian Women's Flying Corps (later known as the Australian Women's Flying Club) held at the Feminist Club of New South Wales at 77 King Street. McKenzie was appointed treasurer and instructor in <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> to the organisation.|$|E
50|$|Initially, iCUBE-1 will {{transmit}} a Continuous Wave <b>Morse</b> <b>coded</b> beacon with message “iCUBE-1 First CubeSat of Pakistan”. Amateur radio operators have a {{great opportunity}} to hear those signals on the VHF band. The satellite will send its health data to ground stations and can also be commanded from Satellite tracking and Control Station at IST.|$|R
50|$|In the Czech language, the {{mnemonic}} {{device to}} remember <b>Morse</b> <b>codes</b> lies in remembering words that begin with each appropriate letter and has so called long vowel (i.e. á é í ó ú ý) for every dash and short vowel (a e i o u y) for every dot. Additionally, some other theme-related sets of words have been thought out as Czech folklore.|$|R

The book Medea: Zag Zig Series features photographs of Stephan Crasneanscki and texts by Arthur Larrue.|$|R
5|$|Pilots had {{to verify}} that they were tuned to the correct range station {{frequency}} by comparing its <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> identifier against the one published on their navigation charts. They would also verify they were flying towards or away from the station, by determining if the signal level (i.e. the audible tone volume) was getting stronger or weaker, respectively.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 65, Babcock {{became a}} pilot. As of 2006 he was in good mental and {{physical}} health, displayed by his ability to quickly recite the alphabet backwards, spell out his name in <b>Morse</b> <b>Code,</b> and take daily walks with his wife to keep in shape. At the age of 100 he wrote an autobiography titled Ten Decades of John Foster Babcock. It was distributed only to family and friends.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the repeating A or N modulation signal, each transmitting station would also transmit its two-letter <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> identifier once every thirty seconds for positive identification. The station identification would be sent twice: first on the N pair of transmitters, then on the A, to ensure coverage in all quadrants. Also, in some installations local weather conditions were periodically broadcast in voice over the range frequency, preempting the navigational signals, but eventually this was done on the central fifth tower.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the <b>Morse</b> <b>coding</b> of the geodesic flow on the hyperbolic plane H {{with respect to}} a Dirichlet fundamental domain D of a Fuchsian group Γ. The main theorem states that the codes of all the generic geodesics constitute a k-step topological Markov chain, if and only if the fundamental domain D is an ideal polygon (i. e. has all of its vertices on the absolute). Comment: 11 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
500|$|Based on {{a network}} of radio towers which {{transmitted}} directional radio signals, the LFR defined specific airways in the sky. Pilots navigated the LFR by listening to a stream of automated [...] "A" [...] and [...] "N" [...] <b>Morse</b> <b>codes.</b> For example, they would turn the aircraft to the right when hearing an [...] "N" [...] stream ("dah-dit, dah-dit, ..."), to the left when hearing an [...] "A" [...] stream ("di-dah, di-dah, ..."), and fly straight ahead while hearing a steady tone.|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} summer of 1916, {{he was awarded}} the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern. On 22 July 1916, he notched his eighth win, thus earning the Pour le Mérite. He {{continued}} with KEK Vaux when it became Jasta 4, and was wounded in action with them on 4 March 1917. Althaus then transferred to Jasta 14. Manfred von Richthofen personally requested Althaus's transfer to Jasta 10. Althaus took command on 6 July 1917. He made a bit of a splash, marking his Albatros D.V's chrome yellow fuselage with the five dots and a dash that <b>Morse</b> <b>Coded</b> his nickname initials of 'H A'.|$|R
5|$|Inside Olivia's mind, Walter and Peter {{find they}} {{stand out as}} invaders, {{and the people that}} {{populate}} her mind, including a vision of her step-father (Chris Bradford), seek to stop them. Walter sees someone sending a <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> signal from William Bell's office in one of the World Trade Center buildings. After evading a crowd and a trap set by a false vision of Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), they arrive at Bell's office, where they find William waiting for them as an animated cartoon.|$|E
5|$|Popular {{modes of}} {{operation}} include voice communication using amplitude modulation (AM), and <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> using continuous wave (CW) radiotelegraphy. Among enthusiasts, there is considerable interest in owning, restoring and operating vintage military and commercial radio equipment, much of it more than 40 years old. Some undertake to construct their own gear, known in ham slang as homebrewing, using vintage parts and designs. A number of amateur radio clubs and organizations sponsor contests, events, and swap meets that cater to this specialized aspect of the hobby.|$|E
5|$|The Amateur Station Operator's Licence, General Grade, {{requires}} {{a minimum of}} 50% in each section of the written examination, and 60% overall, and a demonstration of proficiency in sending and receiving <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> at 8 words per minute (without errors for each). The minimum age is 14 years. The licence allows a user to make radiotelegraphy and radiotelephony transmission in 13 frequency bands. The maximum power allowed is 400W. In addition, satellite communication, facsimile, and television modes are permitted.|$|E
50|$|The {{resulting}} {{network was}} far reaching and didn't have a name. After the arrests, the Gestapo labeled them Red Orchestra (Rote Kapelle). In the Gestapo's terms, a spy hitting <b>Morse</b> <b>codes</b> was a pianist, {{a group of}} pianists formed an orchestra, and, as Communists, they were red. In reality, the resistance group had members {{from all walks of}} life. Membership included people from all social classes and age groups, and also from varied religious ideologies, e.g., mainly communist and National Bolshevik, and Jews and Christians. The group was also 40% female, practicing the egalitarian beliefs that were also present in the Irish Citizen Army and Cumann na mBan during the 1916 Irish Rebellion.|$|R
5000|$|The typical word thus {{determines the}} dot length. It {{is common to}} assume that a word is 5 {{characters}} long. There are two common typical words: [...] "PARIS" [...] and [...] "CODEX". PARIS mimics a word rate that is typical of natural language words and reflects the benefits of <b>Morse</b> <b>code's</b> shorter code durations for common characters such as [...] "e" [...] and [...] "t". CODEX offers a word rate that is typical of 5-letter code groups (sequences of random letters). Using the word PARIS as a standard, the number of dot units is 50 and a simple calculation shows that the dot length at 20 words per minute is 60 milliseconds. Using the word CODEX with 60 dot units, the dot length at 20 words per minute is 50 milliseconds.|$|R

5|$|The {{trading area}} is {{surrounded}} by desks allowing workers to support transactions. In the early days, the desks served as a relay point between the pits and those wishing to buy or sell. When trade orders and information began to be communicated by telegraph, <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> operators were employed, later replaced by phone operators. In the late 20th century, electric display boards lined {{the walls of the}} trading hall and the advent of electronic trading resulted in computers being placed on desktops.|$|E
5|$|To {{obtain a}} licence, {{candidates}} must pass the Amateur Station Operator's Certificate examination {{conducted by the}} WPC. The examination consists of two 50-mark written sections: Radio theory and practice, Regulations; and a practical test consisting of a demonstration of <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> proficiency in sending and receiving. After passing the examination, the candidate must clear a police interview. After clearance, the WPC grants the licence along with the user-chosen call sign. This procedure {{can take up to}} one year. This licence is valid for up to five years.|$|E
5|$|Two weeks earlier, Owen, {{an unhappy}} and lonely 12-year-old boy who is {{neglected}} by his divorcing parents, sees a young girl, Abby, {{and an older}} man moving in next door. Owen and Abby become close friends and start communicating by <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> through the walls of their apartments. At school, a teenage bully named Kenny {{and two of his}} friends constantly terrorize Owen, who lies to his mother about it but tells Abby the truth. Abby encourages him to retaliate, and pledges to protect him.|$|E
25|$|Changes {{to a new}} writing medium {{sometimes}} {{caused a}} break in graphical form, or make the relationship difficult to trace. It is not immediately obvious that the cuneiform Ugaritic alphabet derives from a prototypical Semitic abjad, for example, although {{this appears to be}} the case. And while manual alphabets are a direct continuation of the local written alphabet (both the British two-handed and the French/American one-handed alphabets retain the forms of the Latin alphabet, as the Indian manual alphabet does Devanagari, and the Korean does Hangul), Braille, semaphore, maritime signal flags, and the <b>Morse</b> <b>codes</b> are essentially arbitrary geometric forms. The shapes of the English Braille and semaphore letters, for example, are derived from the alphabetic order of the Latin alphabet, but not from the graphic forms of the letters themselves. Most modern forms of shorthand are also unrelated to the alphabet, generally transcribing sounds instead of letters.|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the internal representation {{and the performance of}} serial tasks is studied. An experiment is reported in which subjects tapped as fast as possible serial ‘finger patterns’: sequences of taps made with different fingers. The patterns are assumed to be represented internally as hierarchies of operations. The latencies between successive taps are predicted from a production model- the Tree Traversal interpreter- which specifies the necessary actions to produce the finger pattern from a hierarchical memory representation. It was found that varying the internal representation of one and the same sequence of taps affects the performance in a predictable way. The relation of the proposed model to general theories of complex motor behavior is discussed. The last decade has shown a growing interest in the study of complex motor tasks, like the tapping of <b>morse</b> <b>codes,</b> typing, speaking, piano playing and rhythm production (Klapp 1977; MacNeilage 1970; Marti...|$|R
50|$|In the 1830s {{the first}} {{commercial}} telegraph system was constructed in England. Over time the system was perfected and across the world overhead telegraph lines were built at rapid pace to connected towns and countries. The telegraph system allowed immediate communications by <b>Morse</b> telegraph <b>codes</b> to pass important government, commercial and private messages which up until then were delivered by mail on coaches and horseback.|$|R
5|$|A {{report by}} an amateur radio {{operator}} {{who claimed to}} have received a faint SOS signal from Star Dust initially raised hopes that there might have been survivors, but all subsequent attempts over the years to find the vanished flight failed. In the absence of any hard evidence, numerous theories arose —including rumours of sabotage (compounded by the later disappearance of two other aircraft also belonging to British South American Airways); speculation that the flight might have been blown up to destroy diplomatic documents being carried by passenger Paul Simpson; or even the suggestion that Star Dust might have been taken or destroyed by a UFO (an idea fuelled by unresolved questions about the flight's final <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> message).|$|E
5|$|Civilian {{telephones}} {{were used}} {{at the outset of}} the war, but they were found to be unreliable in the damp, muddy conditions that prevailed. Consequently, the field telephone was designed; a device that operated with its own switchboard. Apart from voice communication, it featured a buzzer unit with a <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> key, so that it could be used to send and receive coded messages. This facility proved useful when, in the midst of bombardment, exploding shells drowned out voice communication. The telephones were connected by lines that sustained continual damage as a result of shell fire and the movement of troops. The lines were generally buried, with redundant lines set in place to compensate for breakages.|$|E
5|$|The flight left Buenos Aires at 1.46 PM on 2 August and was {{apparently}} uneventful until the radio operator (Harmer) sent a routine message in <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> {{to the airport}} in Santiago at 5.41 PM, announcing an expected arrival of 5.45 PM. However, Star Dust never arrived, no more radio transmissions were received by the airport, and intensive efforts by both Chilean and Argentine search teams, {{as well as by}} other BSAA pilots, failed to uncover any trace of the aircraft or of the people on board. The head of BSAA, Air Vice Marshal Don Bennett, personally directed an unsuccessful five-day search.|$|E
500|$|The LFR {{navigation}} system required, at a minimum, only a simple AM radio receiver {{on board the}} aircraft to accurately navigate the airways under instrument meteorological conditions, and even execute an instrument approach to low minimums. On the downside, however, it had only four course directions per station, was sensitive to atmospheric {{and other types of}} interference and aberrations, and required pilots to listen for hours to an annoying monotonous beep, or a faint stream of <b>Morse</b> <b>codes,</b> often embedded in background [...] "static". Its eventual replacement, the VHF band VOR {{navigation system}}, had many advantages. The VOR was virtually immune to interference, had 360 available course directions, had a visual [...] "on course" [...] display (with no listening needed), and was far easier to use. Consequently, when the VOR system became available in the early 1950s its acceptance was rapid, and within a decade the LFR was mostly phased out. VOR itself is gradually being phased out today in favor of the far superior Global Positioning System (GPS).|$|R
60|$|When {{circumstances}} permit, the heliograph {{is sometimes}} used. The {{rays of the}} sun are thrown by a system of mirrors to the point with which it is desired to communicate, and then interrupted by means of a shutter, making dots and dashes as used in the <b>Morse</b> telegraph <b>code.</b> This system is used only when operations ashore are going on, as the rolling of the ship would prevent the concentration of the sun’s rays.|$|R
50|$|De Jonge {{arrived in}} London on the 31 August 1941, and was {{immediately}} interrogated by the British Secret Service. At {{the end of the}} interrogation, and partially due to De Jonge's attitude throughout, he was asked if he would consider serving as an agent in occupied Netherlands. He had already been considering this on his own, and he agreed. Before starting his training, he spoke on Radio Oranje directed at the Netherlands. During his training De Jonge was not impressed with the Centrale Inlichtingendienst (Dutch Central Intelligence Service), which administered the operations, but he was impressed with British Military Intelligence Section 9, which did the training work. He was instructed in <b>morse,</b> <b>coding</b> and decoding, security measures and training in the organization and ranks in the German army. While training in London he met his older brother Marien. Marien would ship out with the Princess Irene Brigade to the far east in March. Ernst was scheduled to return to the Netherlands at any time. In February the two brothers took leave of each other at Paddington Station, knowing well they might not see each other again.|$|R
