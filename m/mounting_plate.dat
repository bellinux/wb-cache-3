25|$|The TRAXX carbody {{design and}} {{internal}} configuration was modified again in 2006 {{when the first}} actual Diesel-electric version was built, to provide the same layout for Diesel and electric versions. In the electric versions, the central location of the diesel engine {{was used for the}} AC transformer or the DC chokes. The weight of the component at the central location is supported on a horizontal <b>mounting</b> <b>plate</b> that fits onto the main frame using the same fixtures. This generation of the family is also referred to as the TRAXX2E platform, the type designations themselves didn't change. The TRAXX2E generation also included the first actual deliveries of the DC versions of the TRAXX platform. The AC version of the TRAXX2 remained in production in parallel with the 2E versions of other types.|$|E

2500|$|Soap bar casing has a {{rectangular}} shape and the mounting screws are {{contained within the}} coil perimeter, positioned between the pole pieces, between {{the second and third}} strings and between the fourth and fifth strings, thus creating an irregular and somewhat unusual pattern. Occasionally they are mistaken for pole pieces, thus sometimes the P-90 is erroneously said to have eight pole pieces. The [...] "soap bar" [...] nickname most probably comes from its shape and proportions, and that the first P-90s on the original Gibson Les Paul Model of 1952 were white. A variant of is one which uses the [...] "dog ear" [...] <b>mounting</b> <b>plate</b> or frame, but the [...] "soap bar" [...] cover; the reason for the variation was to mount the pickup from a flat overlying pickguard, such as on the Gibson SG Special (and other SG guitars using P-90's). [...] The [...] "dog ear" [...] <b>mounting</b> <b>plate</b> is fitted with screws and springs, that attach it to the flat pickguard, allowing the pickup to hang within the body rout.

40|$|The {{elimination}} of hot spots and {{the reduction of}} eddy current losses in bushing <b>mounting</b> <b>plates</b> is an important consideration in transformer design. The currently used bushing <b>mounting</b> <b>plates</b> are either mild steel plates, or mild steel plates with non-magnetic stainless steel inserts or stainless steel plates. The authors calculate the eddy current losses in bushing <b>mounting</b> <b>plates</b> using four different methods; (i) an analytical formulation; (ii) a three-dimensional finite element method (FEM); (iii) from measured values of the initial temperature rise; and (iv) from measured values of the steady-state temperature rise. There is a close agreement between the loss values obtained using these four methods. The analysis {{has resulted in a}} detailed understanding of the loss pattern and temperature rise phenomenon in bushing <b>mounting</b> <b>plates.</b> The authors also analyse tank plates of small pad-mounted distribution transformers. It is shown that judicious use of non-magnetic stainless steel can result in considerable energy savings for pad-mounted transformers. FEM simulations are performed to find out cost-effective materials for the tank plates of the pad-mounted transformers. A T-shaped stainless steel plate is found to significantly reduce the load loss. The results of the simulations have been verified on a 225 kVA pad-mounted transformer...|$|R
50|$|The Mk 47 {{computer}} was a radical improvement in accessibility over the Mk 1/1A. It was {{more akin to}} a tall, wide storage cabinet in shape, with most or all dials on the front vertical surface. Its mechanism was built in six sections, each mounted on very heavy-duty pull-out slides. Behind the panel were typically a horizontal and a vertical <b>mounting</b> <b>plate,</b> arranged in a tee.|$|E
50|$|Keystone modules have a {{rectangular}} face of 14.5 mm wide by 16.0 mm high and {{are held in}} place with flexible tabs. This allows them to be snapped into a <b>mounting</b> <b>plate</b> with correspondingly-sized rectangular holes, called ports. All keystones, regardless {{of the type of}} jack they carry, are interchangeable and replaceable. This provides much flexibility in arranging and mounting many different types of electrical jacks in one plate or panel without requiring customized manufacturing.|$|E
50|$|The Spademan system {{became very}} popular in the late 1970s. Production mis-steps right when new toe-and-heel {{bindings}} were being introduced led to a , and the Spademan system disappeared in the early 1980s. However, {{the fact that it}} used a single <b>mounting</b> <b>plate</b> eliminated adjustments for different sized boots, which made it popular in rental shops for some time. The Look Integral was introduced to fill this niche when Spademan exited the market.|$|E

50|$|The {{fuel level}} sender units are {{physically}} different between the two models, this {{could be due to}} the differentmethods used to report the fuel level (B1-gauge, B2-LCD).

The DFI fuel delivery hardware appears to be the same. The 1983 model also uses the same fuel pump and TBI setup as the B2.|$|E
