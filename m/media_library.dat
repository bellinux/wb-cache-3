The device also introduced Music Hub, an online music store powered by 7digital with a catalogue of over 19million songs.|$|E
5|$|The iPhone 4S {{can play}} music, movies, {{television}} shows, ebooks, audiobooks, and podcasts and can sort its <b>media</b> <b>library</b> by songs, artists, albums, videos, playlists, genres, composers, podcasts, audiobooks, and compilations. Options are always presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from iTunes. The iPhone 4S uses a large font that allows users {{plenty of room}} to touch their selection. Users can rotate their device horizontally to landscape mode to access Cover Flow. Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks. On the 4S, the volume can be changed with the included Apple Earphones, and the Voice Control feature can be used to identify a track, play songs in a playlist or by a specific artist, or create a Genius playlist.|$|E
40|$|The {{social media}} {{statistics}} of South Africa reveal an exponential {{increase in the}} use of social <b>media.</b> <b>Libraries,</b> as part of a community, cannot ignore this! Social <b>media</b> provide <b>libraries</b> instant and direct connection with their members regardless their geographical location. This paper explores social <b>media</b> use in <b>libraries.</b> The establishment of social media for the SABC <b>Media</b> <b>Libraries</b> is discussed to demonstrate a practical implementation of social <b>media</b> in <b>libraries</b> and archives. Tips and resources, with specific mention to Twitter and Facebook, as well as social media etiquette and social media policy guidelines are supplied. The literature of published articles and Infographic show the changing role of librarians in the social media era and the need for librarians to keep learning and update their skills to accommodate users’ needs. The focus should now be on how well we do social <b>media</b> for the <b>library,</b> not on whether we should do it or not!

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to determine the initial impact of the Oklahoma <b>Library</b> <b>Media</b> Improvement Grants on Oklahoma school <b>library</b> <b>media</b> programs; assess whether the Oklahoma <b>Library</b> <b>Media</b> Improvement Grants continue to contribute to Oklahoma school learning communities; and examine possible relationships between school <b>library</b> <b>media</b> programs and student academic success. It also seeks to document the history of the Oklahoma <b>Library</b> <b>Media</b> Improvement Program 1978 - 1994 and increase awareness of its influence upon the Oklahoma school <b>library</b> <b>media</b> programs. Methods of data collection included: examining Oklahoma <b>Library</b> <b>Media</b> Improvement Program archival materials; sending a survey to 1703 school principals in Oklahoma; and interviewing Oklahoma <b>Library</b> <b>Media</b> Improvement Program participants. Data collection took place over a one year period. Data analyses were conducted in three primary phases: descriptive statistics and frequencies were disaggregated to examine mean scores as they related to money spent on school <b>library</b> <b>media</b> programs; opinions of school <b>library</b> <b>media</b> programs; and possible relationships between school <b>library</b> <b>media</b> programs and student academic achievement. Analysis of variance was used in the second phase of data analysis to determine if any variation between means was significant as related to Oklahoma Library Improvement Grants, time spent in the <b>library</b> <b>media</b> center by <b>library</b> <b>media</b> specialists, principal gender, opinions of <b>library</b> <b>media</b> programs, student achievement indicators, and the region of the state in which the respondent was located. The third phase of data analysis compared longitudinal data collected in the 2000 survey with past data. The primary results indicated students in Oklahoma from schools with a centralized <b>library</b> <b>media</b> center, served by a full-time <b>library</b> <b>media</b> specialist, and the school having received one or more <b>Library</b> <b>Media</b> Improvement Grants scored significantly higher academically than students in schools not having a centralized <b>library</b> <b>media</b> center, not served by a full-time <b>library</b> <b>media</b> specialist, and the school not having received one or more <b>Library</b> <b>Media</b> Improvement Grants. Students in schools having even one of these components scored higher academically than students in schools with none of these components...|$|R

This study explored Virginia elementary school principals 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the instructional role of the <b>library</b> <b>media</b> specialist, the effect of library schedule on these perceptions, and the origin of these perceptions. Principals who responded to the study strongly endorsed the role of <b>library</b> <b>media</b> specialist as teacher of information literacy skills and as instructional partner. There was no statistically significant difference in perceptions based on the type of library schedule in placefixed, flexible, or mixed/combination. Respondents indicated that they learn about the instructional role of the <b>library</b> <b>media</b> specialist from <b>library</b> <b>media</b> specialists with whom they work, either in their current positions as principals or through their previous experiences as classroom teachers. Principals form their views based on both negative and positive interactions with <b>library</b> <b>media</b> specialists and base their expectations of their current and future <b>library</b> <b>media</b> specialists on these prior experiences and expectations. This finding indicates that school <b>library</b> <b>media</b> specialist preparation programs should prepare their graduates to positively present their key instructional role and that training in this area should be provided for those <b>library</b> <b>media</b> specialists already in the field. Another key finding was that principals place primary responsibility for initiation of collaboration at both the individual teacher and the school level with the <b>library</b> <b>media</b> specialist.
