5|$|Among the organisations that Playford {{belonged to}} was the local {{branch of the}} Liberal Federation, yet until the months {{preceding}} his eventual election, he never talked of holding political office. The Liberal Federation was considering a merger with the Country Party to avoid Labor retaining office during the Great Depression. Archie Cameron, an old wartime friend of Playford's and a federal Coalition MP, influenced Playford {{to run for office}} when he heard of the merger. In 1932 the Liberal and Country League (LCL) was created, and Playford ran for the <b>multi-member</b> <b>constituency</b> of Murray at the 1933 election.|$|E
5|$|To the LCL, {{this was}} a {{dangerous}} situation, and seeing a need to avoid it, they compromised: their position abruptly changed to being in favour of wholesale reform of the Legislative Council. When Dunstan put forward bills to reform it, the LCL relented, and Eastick convinced the LCL councillors to let them pass, conditional on amendments to the legislation. These were a minor change to the particular proportional system used to elect the councillors, and that it remained non compulsory {{to vote in the}} council. The new council would eventually have 22 members, with half elected each election from a <b>multi-member</b> <b>constituency</b> covering the entirety of the state. Hall attacked the LCL for its sudden change in stance on reform, and managed to see the first LM policy become law with the lowering of the council suffrage age to 18.|$|E
25|$|The Lal Communist Party contested the Punjab and PEPSU Legislative Assembly {{elections}} held on 27 March 1952. The party presented five {{candidates in}} PEPSU (Sangrur, Sunam, Lehra and two {{candidates in the}} <b>multi-member</b> <b>constituency</b> Phagwara). In Punjab the party presented nine candidates (Balachar, Gharhshankar, Nawanshehr, Nurmahal, Nakodar, Bagha Purana, Patti, Tarn Tarn and Sri Gobind Pur). The election symbol of the party was a railway engine. It managed to win the Sunam seat in the PEPSU assembly and the Bagha Purana seat in the Punjab assembly. Both of the assembly members of the party were named Bachan Singh (one living in Moga and one living in Sangrur).|$|E
50|$|The 255 {{members of}} the National Assembly are elected from 154 single and <b>multi-member</b> <b>constituencies</b> with up to six seats using first-past-the-post voting. In <b>multi-member</b> <b>constituencies</b> voters cast a single vote for a closed list, with the list {{receiving}} the most votes winning all seats in the constituency.|$|R
50|$|For the {{election}} {{the country was}} divided into 219 constituencies. Of these, 215 were single member <b>constituencies</b> and four <b>multi-member</b> <b>constituencies.</b> Within the 215 single member constituencies, only 20 were elected by secret ballot, the remainder (which were rural constituencies) using open elections. All four <b>multi-member</b> <b>constituencies</b> used secret ballots.|$|R

500|$|In the 1921 election, Boyle both sought {{re-election}} in Sturgeon and {{election in the}} new <b>multi-member</b> <b>constituency</b> of Edmonton. [...] He was defeated in the former but victorious in the latter, making him one of two members from the 1st Alberta Legislative Assembly to be elected to the 5th; the other was Cross, Boyle's predecessor as Attorney-General and rival from the Alberta and Great Waterways Affair. [...] Provincially, the Liberals were soundly defeated by the United Farmers of Alberta (UFA), which, contesting their first election, won 39 seats to the Liberals' 14.|$|E
2500|$|A third {{alternative}} {{to fulfill a}} vacancy is to hold a single-winner by-election (effectively instant-runoff unless {{there is more than}} one vacancy); this allows each party to choose a new candidate and all voters to participate. This often leads to a different party winning the seat (usually one of the largest parties, since the quota is large). In the Republic of Ireland, by-elections are used for the Dáil and for the Seanad where voters in the Dáil constituency or Seanad panel vote to fill the vacancy or vacancies. [...] This removes the balance of proportionality of the original election. [...] The costs of holding a by-election in a <b>multi-member</b> <b>constituency</b> is considerable. In a recent review of the City of Melbourne, Australia, electoral requirements the cost of holding a City wide ballot to fill a casual vacancy was estimated to cost over 1 million Australian Dollars.|$|E
2500|$|A monarch-appointed senate with 100 {{members was}} established, equal {{in size to}} the house of representatives. As in {{previous}} constitutions, the monarch still did not have an absolute veto. However, the monarch-appointed senate could, through a simple majority over the combined houses of parliament, sustain a royal veto. The chairman of the Supreme State Council had to countersign any royal orders in order to make them official (when the constitution was announced, Bhumibol Adulyadej was still a minor and the privy council performed the king's regnal duties on his behalf. Thus in practice, the Supreme Council of State itself selected and appointed senators and had the power of veto). [...] The ban on civil servants and soldiers serving in parliament and the cabinet was removed. Another key change stated that the policies of one government could not be altered by a succeeding government without royal approval. A <b>multi-member</b> <b>constituency</b> system replaced the single member constituency system which had been in effect since 1932. The minimum age of electoral candidates was raised from 23 to 35. Numerous MPs elected under the 1946 constitution had been under the age of 30, but were ineligible under the junta's constitution.|$|E
