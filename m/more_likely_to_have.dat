5|$|It is {{not clear}} whether men or women have higher rates of low back pain. A 2012 review {{reported}} a rate of 9.6% among males and 8.7% among females. Another 2012 review found a higher rate in females than males, which the reviewers felt was possibly due to greater rates of pains due to osteoporosis, menstruation, and pregnancy among women, or possibly because women were more willing to report pain than men. An estimated 70% of women experience back pain during pregnancy with the rate being higher the further along in pregnancy. Current smokers – and especially those who are adolescents – are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> low back pain than former smokers, and former smokers are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> low back pain than those who have never smoked.|$|E

Among women born in the United States, women who are wealthier are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> breastfeed. In addition, employment can influence the decision to breastfeed. When either parent was unemployed or held a lower-status occupation (such as labor or sales), their children were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> never <b>have</b> been breastfed. In addition, women with public insurance or with no health insurance are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> never <b>have</b> breastfed their children, as are women who receive WIC.|$|R
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} may be suspected on {{the basis}} of the history and examination. To confirm the diagnosis, as well as excluding alternative causes, several investigations are required; more investigations may be performed if the history is not typical or the patient is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an alternative problem: children, men, the elderly, or women who are not overweight.|$|E
5|$|Factors such as hypoxia and infection, or {{stress and}} {{malnutrition}} {{in the mother}} during fetal development, {{may result in a}} slight increase in the risk of schizophrenia later in life. People diagnosed with schizophrenia are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been born in winter or spring (at least in the northern hemisphere), which may be a result of increased rates of viral exposures in utero. The increased risk is about five to eight percent. Other infections during pregnancy or around the time of birth that may increase the risk include Toxoplasma gondi and Chlamydia.|$|E
5|$|Insecure {{attachment}} {{styles in}} toddlers involve unusual reunions after separation from a familiar person.

30|$|Also in Table  4, we {{summarize}} teachers’ self-report {{data from}} the survey on prompts related <b>to</b> <b>having</b> enough time <b>to</b> plan for all their content areas, to plan for mathematics or science instruction, to investigate additional resources, and to meet with other teachers about mathematics or science instruction. The first of these factors is significant for both mathematics and science, such that specialists are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report <b>having</b> enough time <b>to</b> plan {{for all of the}} subjects they teach. It is important to recognize that, even for these specialists, the mean is low, less than 3 for both content areas on a 1 – 6 scale. In mathematics, EMS are significantly <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report <b>having</b> enough time <b>to</b> plan for their mathematics instruction. Although not statistically significant, specialists also are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report <b>having</b> enough time <b>to</b> investigate additional resources related to their mathematics or science instruction. Thus, the specialists’ indications of having more specialized content-focused planning time and the affordances that this provides are supported by the self-report survey data.|$|R

To some extent, the symptoms depend upon the location of the tumor: patients with cholangiocarcinoma in the extrahepatic bile ducts (outside the liver) are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> jaundice, while those with tumors of the bile ducts within the liver more often have pain without jaundice.|$|E

This view was expressed in 2005 by Denis Jeambar, editor-in-chief of L'Express, and , a former France2 correspondent, who viewed the raw footage.

5|$|A 2007–2008 {{survey of}} over 19% of all colonies {{revealed}} {{a total loss}} of 35.8%. Operations that pollinated almonds lost, on average, {{the same number of}} colonies as those that did not. The 37.9% of operations that reported having at least some of their colonies die with a complete lack of bees had a total loss of 40.8% of colonies compared to the 17.1% loss reported by beekeepers without this symptom. Large operations were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> this symptom, suggesting a contagious condition may be a causal factor. About 60% of all colonies that were reported dead in this survey died without the presence of dead bees in the hive, thus possibly suffered from CCD.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Dental {{health is}} a {{neglected}} aspect of adolescent health globally but {{more so in}} low-income countries. Secondary analysis using the 2004 Zambia Global School-Based Health Survey (GSHS) was conducted in which we estimated frequencies of relevant socio-demographic variables and explored associations between selected explanatory variables and self-reported poor oral hygiene (not cleaning or brushing teeth) within the last 30 days of the completion of questionnaire. Findings Most of the 2257 respondents were males (53. 9 %) and went hungry (82. 5 %). More than 4 in 10 respondents drank alcohol (42. 2 %) while 37. 2 % smoked cannabis. Overall 10. 0 % {{of the respondents reported}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> poor oral hygiene. Male respondents were 7 % less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report <b>to</b> <b>have</b> poor oral hygiene compared to females. Compared to respondents who never drank alcohol, those who drank alcohol were 27 % <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report <b>to</b> <b>have</b> poor oral hygiene. Respondents who smoked cannabis were 4 % <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report <b>to</b> <b>have</b> poor oral hygiene compared to those who did not smoke cannabis. Finally, respondents who went hungry were 35 % <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report <b>to</b> <b>have</b> poor oral hygiene compared to those who did not go hungry. Conclusions Results from this study indicate that female gender, alcohol drinking, cannabis smoking, and going hungry were associated with self-reported poor oral hygiene. The identification of these factors should guide the design and implementation of programs aimed to improve oral health among adolescents. </p...|$|R

5|$|Borobudur differs {{markedly}} {{from the}} general design of other structures built for this purpose. Instead of being built on a flat surface, Borobudur is built on a natural hill.

40|$|Introduction: Numerous {{studies have}} {{emphasized}} the importance of contextual factors as determinants of sexual behavior of adolescents. It has been found that lower socioeconomic status is associated with risky sexual behavior. Sexual behavior is individual but develops under strong influence of cultural and other influences. Objective. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the association of family’s socioeconomic status and risky sexual behavior of adolescents in Belgrade. Method. Self-administered questionnaire was used in secondary schools in Belgrade, and 1, 782 adolescents attending first grade filled the questionnaire. For the analyses of predictors of risky sexual behavior, multiple logistic regression was used. Results. Parents’ occupations did not show significant association with any of analyzed behaviors. Adolescents who received weekly disposable money above average were 2. 5 times <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> ever <b>have</b> had sexual intercourse, and if sexually active were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> use contraception. Perceived family’s wealth was a significant predictor of ever having sex (OR= 1. 9; CI 1. 2 - 2. 8) and not using contraception (OR= 4. 3; CI 1. 2 - 15. 0). Conclusion. Socioeconomic status is associated with sexual behaviors of adolescents. Fifteen-year olds who perceive their families as wealthier are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> ever <b>have</b> had sex and not use any kind of contraception. Adolescents with higher weekly income are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> ever <b>have</b> had sex and use contraception than their counterpats with less weekly disposable money. ...|$|R

The same was found for female asexual participants over their heterosexual counterparts; however, non-asexual, non-heterosexual females had the highest rates. Asexual participants of both sexes were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> anxiety disorders than heterosexual and non-heterosexual participants, as were they more likely than heterosexual participants to report having had recent suicidal feelings. Yule et al. hypothesised that some of these differences may be due to discrimination and other societal factors.|$|E
5|$|In adults, {{blood lead}} levels {{steadily}} increase with increasing age. In adults of all ages, men have higher blood lead levels than women do. Children {{are more sensitive}} to elevated blood lead levels than adults are. Children may also have a higher intake of lead than adults; they breathe faster and may be <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> contact with and ingest soil. Children of ages one to three tend to have the highest blood lead levels, possibly because at that age they begin to walk and explore their environment, and they use their mouths in their exploration. Blood levels usually peak at about 18–24months old. In many countries including the US, household paint and dust are the major route of exposure in children.|$|E
5|$|Plays {{were being}} {{performed}} while Corder was still awaiting trial, and an anonymous author published a melodramatic {{version of the}} murder after the execution, a precursor of the Newgate novels which quickly became best-sellers. The Red Barn Murder was a popular subject, along {{with the story of}} Jack Sheppard and other highwaymen, thieves and murderers, for penny gaffs, cheap plays performed in the back rooms of public houses. James Catnach sold more than a million broadsides (sensationalist single sheet newspapers) which gave details of Corder's confession and the execution, and included a sentimental ballad supposedly written by Corder himself (though <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been the work of Catnach or somebody in his employ).

Traditionally, the tails were of different shapes, but docking had previously been used. With regards to their health, according to a 2004 survey, they both had similar lifespans, although kidney or urethral conditions are more likely in the Pembrokes. Furthermore, Pembroke Corgis were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> eye problems than the Cardigan breed.
