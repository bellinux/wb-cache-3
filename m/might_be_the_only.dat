5|$|In April 1975, {{a single}} Jaguar {{was used to}} test the aircraft's rough {{airstrip}} capacity, by landing and taking off multiple times from the M55 motorway, the final test flight was conducted with a full weapons load; the ability was never used in service but was considered useful as improvised runways <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> runways left available in a large scale European conflict. In a high intensity European war, the role of the Jaguar was to support land forces on the Continent in resisting a Soviet assault on Western Europe, striking targets beyond the forward edge of the battlefield should a conflict escalate. The apparent mismatch between aircraft numbers and nuclear bombs was a consequence of RAF staff planners concluding that there would be one third attrition of Jaguars in an early conventional phase, leaving the survivors numerically strong enough to deliver the entire allocated stockpile of 56 nuclear bombs.|$|E

25|$|The film {{is notable}} for its avant-garde style, shot on stark high-contrast {{black-and-white}} film, using the spherical cinematographic process with allusions to French New Wave cinema. The striking black-and-white photography of the film's cinematographer, Stephen H. Burum, lies in two main sources: the films of Orson Welles and German cinema of the 1920s. When {{the film was}} in its pre-production phase, Coppola asked Burum how he wanted to film it and they agreed that it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> chance they were ever {{going to have to}} make a black-and-white film.|$|E

In Rose's ending it is hinted that he <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> one powerful enough to stop Bison (though in Street Fighter V, Bison is destroyed once and for all by Ryu), and in Cody's ending Guy is shown trying to persuade him to come back {{on the right side of}} the law. Guy is also the one who threw the kunai in Fei Long's ending in the original Street Fighter IV, since Ibuki has no involvement with S.I.N.|$|E

25|$|The social status, {{duties and}} legal {{powers of the}} {{headmaster}} depended on the society in which he conducted his school. In a small school, he <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> or the chief teacher. In a university-sized school {{he would be the}} director of the school, its museum, and its library. Plato as scholiarch owned his school, the land, {{and the rest of the}} property. He had to sponsor the resident foreigners, representing them at law. Aristotle at the foundation of the Lyceum was not, as a resident foreigner, allowed to own property in Athens. He rented the buildings and organized the students into an administration. Socrates was a voluntary consultant who conducted discussions at various times and places, some public, others contributed by interested persons.The scholiarchs of Alexandria were royal officers hired by the king.|$|E
