40|$|Coal is a {{heterogeneous}} substance and its heterogeneity is identified and characterized by variation in reflectance. The main {{objective of this}} paper is to characterize the heterogeneity of char and to correlate it with the coal reflectogram, which accounts for both rank and maceral composition effects. Chars from two density fractions in a set of coals were obtained in a Drop Tube Furnace (DTF) at 1400 degrees C in N- 2 environment. The chars were examined under a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and the morphology information was obtained from the image-processing technique. The average porosity of char changes systematically with the FMR of its parent coals (defined as the summation of each reflectance multiplied with its frequency). The char porosity increased with an increase in FMR up to a critical value around 98. With further increase in FMR, the corresponding char becomes dense. The char macro porosity distribution was found to be related to the coal reflectogram. In general, the char porosity distribution shows two peaks, which corresponds to the inertinite and vitrinite peaks in reflectogram. The intensity depends on the maceral content. The relationship between the char porosity and coal reflectance for this set of sample has been found, which is strongly dependent on the coal rank. However. these findings cannot be applied to coals with a strong <b>maceral</b> <b>association</b> (microlithotype) ...|$|E
30|$|During {{the present}} study, coal samples were {{collected}} from Derra underground coal mines following the pillar coal sampling method. Coal {{samples were collected}} from Karharbari Top seam and Karharbari Bottom seam. Their megascopic characterization was performed by using the scheme proposed by Diessel (1965) and macroscopic seam profiles were constructed. For the microscopic study coal samples were crushed to 18 mesh size (< 1  mm size particles). The polished particulate coal mounts were prepared by using cold mounting epoxy resin without pressure. The study was carried out on an advanced petrological microscope equipped with MSP 200 photometry system and fluorescence attachment. The maceral nomenclature applied, followed the ICCP system (1971, 1998, 2001). For the microlithotype analysis, a 20 point Kötter graticule was used. The line to line and {{point to point distance}} was maintained 0.4  mm for both maceral and microlithotype analysis. The maceral and microlithotype counting was done simultaneously. The reflectance measurement was carried out as per the ISO standard (ISO 7404 - 5 1994). For the precise assessment of liptinite and dark vitrinite microscopic examination of macerals was carried out both under the white incident light as well as under blue light excitation. The International Committees for coal Petrology (1971) devised certain rules for the characterization of <b>maceral</b> <b>association.</b> According to which, the minimum dimension of a band to be called a microlithotype, should be 50  ×  50  mm, and the 5  % rule. The 5  % rule demonstrates that a microlithotype can have 5  % accessory macerals due to the very fact that neither the monomaceral nor the bimaceral microlithotypes are constituted exclusively of the macerals of one group or two groups respectively. Therefore, they can have 5  % accessory macerals which will have no role in their nomenclature or characterization. ICCP recommendation has been followed during the characterization of microlithotype. All the coal samples were subjected to proximate (BIS 2003) and petrographic analysis.|$|E
40|$|Two Highveld inertinite-rich lump coals were {{utilized}} as feed coal samples {{in order to}} study their physical, chemical structural and petrographic variations during heat treatment in a packed-bed reactor unit combustor. The two feed lump coals were selected as it is claimed that Coal B converts at a slower rate in a commercial coal conversion process when compared to Coal A. The reason for this requires detailed investigation. Chemical structural variations were determined by proximate and coal char CO 2 reactivity analysis. Physical structural variations were determined by FTIR, BET adsorption methods, XRD and 13 C Solid state NMR analysis. Carbon particle type analysis was conducted to determine the petrographic constituents of the reactor generated samples, their <b>maceral</b> <b>associations</b> (microlithotype), and char morphology. This analysis was undertaken {{with the intention of}} tracking the carbon conversion and char formation and consumption behaviour of the two coal samples within the reactor. Proximate analysis revealed that Coal A released 10...|$|R

An {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to determine the}} gasification and combustion characteristics of chars derived from an inertinite-rich coal discard sample with a high ash content. Fundamental knowledge of the reaction rate kinetics for char conversion at reactions conditions used in fluidised bed gasification and combustion was obtained. For this purpose, characterisation of the parent coal and derived chars, reactivity determinations of the chars and detailed reaction rate modelling was undertaken. The characterisation performed consisted of standard coal analytical methods. petrographic techniques, CCSEM image analysis and a surface adsorption method. The parent coal consists of 32 % by volume of inertinite, 7 % of vitrinite, 13 % of biand tri-macerite, 30 % of maceral/mineral mixtures (carbominerite) with 18 % of mineral-rich material. Reflectances obtained from measurements taken on vitrinites and total maceral reflectance scans increased dramatically on charring at 900 °C and is accompanied by an extension of vitrinite-class distribution. Volatiles were liberated essentially from the original parent vitrinites, creating fine pores. Inertinites increased in reflectance but not in porosity and are characterised as dense char fractions in the final charred product, which was established according to a coal form analysis. Structural change due to low temperature thermal stress fracturing ("passive deflagration") occurred {{early on in the}} temperature regimes, creating increased surface areas and porosity. The chars consist of a high proportion (52 %) of extraneous rock fragments together with minerals mainly as fine inclusions in carbon rich particles. The chars have very low porosities and surface areas created by devolatisation of <b>maceral</b> <b>associations</b> and deflagration. Combustion and gasification reactivity experiments were carried out in a thermogravimetric analyser at 87. 5 and 287. 5 kPa pressures between 700 and 900 'C and with varying mixtures of oxygen/nitrogen and carbon dioxide/nitrogen mixtures respectively. The effects of temperature, pressure, gas composition and particle size on reactivity were found to confirm well-established trends. The effect of temperature in the high temperature range was, however, strongly affected by pore and film diffusion during combustion. Models based on the random pore model without and with pore diffusion incorporating the properties of the char (porosity. ash content, and derived structural parameter) and structural mechanisms concerning carbon removal, were successfully solved and validated against experimental results. As a result of the complexity of the models consisting of many unknown parameters, a procedure consisting of step-wise regression was developed and applied successfully. This procedure uses a unified carbon conversion versus a reduced time parameter plot with the latter defined as real time/time for 90 % conversion. It was found that for char panicles with a mean diameter of 1 mm prepared at 900 °C. the random pore model (chemical reaction controlling) was applicable for predicting the gasification reaction rate with carbon dioxide-nitrogen mixtures at temperatures up to 9 OO'C, whereas for the combustion reactions with oxygen-nitrogen mixtures an adapted chemical reaction-pore diffusion model was found to be applicable in the temperature range 450 to 600 °C. The model is characterised by a variable Thiele modulus which can account for pore- diffusion and can undergo a transition to a chemically controlled reaction {{as a result of the}} depletion of carbon in the carbon/mineral matrix. Intrinsic reaction rate parameters for gasification and combustion are reported and compared with published results, and were Sound to be slightly different. Diffusion coefficients were also evaluated from the combustion reaction results and found to compare very well with predictions with the Knudsen diffusion model. Doctora...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the result of}} the detailed investigations carried out on the coal characteristics, including coal petrography and its geochemistry of the Pabedana region. A total of 16 samples were collected from four coal seams d 2, d 4, d 5, and d 6 of the Pabedana underground mine which is located in {{the central part of the}} Central-East Iranian Microcontinent. These samples were reduced to four samples through composite sampling of each seam and were analyzed for their petrographic, mineralogical, and geochemical compositions. Proximate analysis data of the Pabedana coals indicate no major variations in the moisture, ash, volatile matter, and fixed carbon contents in the coals of different seams. Based on sulfur content, the Pabedana coals may be classified as low-sulfur coals. The low-sulfur contents in the Pabedana coal and relatively low proportion of pyritic sulfur suggest a possible fresh water environment during the deposition of the peat of the Pabedana coal. X-ray diffraction and petrographic analyses indicate the presence of pyrite in coal samples. The Pabedana coals have been classified as a high volatile, bituminous coal in accordance with the vitrinite reflectance values (58. 75 – 74. 32 %) and other rank parameters (carbon, calorific value, and volatile matter content). The maceral analysis and reflectance study suggest that the coals in all the four seams are of good quality with low <b>maceral</b> matter <b>association.</b> Mineralogical investigations indicate that the inorganic fraction in the Pabedana coal samples is dominated by carbonates; thus, constituting the major inorganic fraction of the coal samples. Illite, kaolinite, muscovite, quartz, feldspar, apatite, and hematite occur as minor or trace phases. The variation in major elements content is relatively narrow between different coal seams. Elements Sc,, Zr, Ga, Ge, La, As, W, Ce, Sb, Nb, Th, Pb, Se, Tl, Bi, Hg, Re, Li, Zn, Mo, and Ba show varying negative correlation with ash yield. These elements possibly have an organic affinity and may be present as primary biological concentrations either with tissues in living condition and/or through sorption and formation of organometallic compounds...|$|R
40|$|The {{composition}} {{of a number}} of coals with varying rank was characterized by a number of means with emphasis on petrographic examination. The petrographic data of coals was processed with special emphasis on quantifying vitrinite sub <b>macerals</b> and their <b>association</b> with coal carbonisation parameters as well as coke strength. The association between coal petrography data with coke strength of binary blends as well as industrial blends was also examined. Coke strength parameters including drum index and CSR were found to be predominantly influenced by coal rank with few exceptions of high rank and low fluidity coals. The study showed the association between coke strength and coke micro-texture such that coke strength after reactions was related to increased anisotropic texture. On the basis of vitrinite sub-components a new coal parameter was devised. The new parameter, the ratio of difference of collinite and telinite to the mean vitrinite reflectance, is found to predict coke strength of single coals with high confidence. However, the same parameter could not predict coke strength of binary coke as well as coke made in industrial processes. The study suggested that interaction of sub-vitrinite during carbonisation could be responsible for the limitation of application of the new parameter to predict coke strength of blends. Further investigations relating to the interaction of sub-macerals during carbonisation as well as the role of minerals may improve the confidence of coke strength prediction using the proposed new index...|$|R
