40|$|National audienceThis {{book is a}} {{complete}} study of the material and cultural aspects of manuscripts making in Christian Ethiopia. Palaeography, making of parchment, preparation of inks, preparation of quires, binding, preparation of the writing surface, writing and copying, <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <b>notes</b> and decorations, illuminations [...] . all information necessary for a real codicology of Ethiopian manuscripts is detailed for the first time, with its Amharic and Ge‘ez terminology. Thanks to the professional experience of the author, who has been travelling all over Ethiopia, synchronicity and regionalism have been taken into account. This study {{is based on a}} very vast corpus of manuscripts. The author also deals with cultural and social aspects as the education of scribes, their daily work, and finally gives some short biographies of famous scribes. The book in Amharic is published together with a short English postface by Anaïs Wion (CNRS). It presents the author, the history of this book initiated by the great historian Tadesse Tamrat, {{the state of the art}} in the study of Ethiopian manuscripts and, of course, the need for the publication of the present study. A set of photos of the tools of scribe and parchments makers has been shot and will be inserted all through the book...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} is equivocal {{with respect to}} the neural substrates of idiom processing. Particularly elusive {{is the role of the}} left ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), a region implicated in semantic control generally. Although fMRI studies have shown that the left VLPFC is active during idiom processing (see Rapp et al. (2012), for review), rTMS studies have failed to corroborate a clear role of this prefrontal region (e. g., Oliveri et al., 2004). We investigated this issue using a semantic meaningfulness judgment task that compared idiom comprehension following rTMS-stimulation to the left VLPFC relative to a control site (vertex). We also investigated whether individual differences in general cognitive capacity among comprehenders modulated the effects of rTMS. The results indicate that left VLPFC stimulation particularly affected the processing of low-familiar idioms, possibly because these items involve a maximal semantic conflict between a salient literal and less-known figurative <b>meaning.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>note,</b> this pattern only emerged for comprehenders with higher cognitive control capacity, possibly because they were more likely to activate or maintain multiple semantic representations during idiom processing, which required VLPFC integrity. Taken together, the results support the importance of the left VLPFC to idiom processing...|$|R

40|$|In an {{additional}} section Giancarlo Corsi and Johannes Schmidt explore the Luhmann’s methodology {{of his famous}} card index in search of references to the specific issue of the constitution.

40|$|Abstract. While screensavers {{generally}} display pleasant {{pictures or}} animations, our work discusses {{the possibility of}} utilizing a screensaver for reminding. We ported a peripheral notes display into a screensaver to support reviewing digital inked notes on TabletPCs. We demonstrated the screensaver to 18 participants, but they felt the screensaver was not useful {{in its current form}} as their notes became stale over time and as they felt the screensaver potentially leaked corporate data; however, they suggested a screensaver could be useful for more general reminding of items such as those in to-do lists or e-mail inboxes. Aiding Note-Review with a Screensaver Reviewing notes is tedious. While the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> handwritten <b>notes</b> might be deciphered immediately after writing them, the quality <b>of</b> <b>notes</b> degrade over time (Kalhikaité, 2007). Unfortunately, the value <b>of</b> the <b>notes</b> themselves remains under-utilized if people cannot set-aside the time for note review. Technology can potentially help by “bubbling up ” old notes into the user‟s peripheral vision, interleaving review into the normal workday. Hsieh et a...|$|R

5000|$|The perfect (I {{have gone}} to work; also {{sometimes}} called the present perfect) is mostly formed, again as in English, from the appropriate present tense form of to have (haben) and a past participle of the relevant verb placed {{at the end of}} the clause.

50|$|The sonata form is a {{guide to}} composers as to the {{schematic}} for their works, for interpreters to understand the grammar and <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> a work, and for listeners to understand the significance of musical events. A host of musical details {{are determined by the}} harmonic <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> a particular <b>note,</b> chord or phrase. The sonata form, because it describes the shape and hierarchy of a movement, tells performers what to emphasize, and how to shape phrases of music. Its theory begins with the description, in the 18th century, of schematics for works, and was codified in the early 19th century. This codified form is still used in the pedagogy of the sonata form.|$|R

40|$|I {{question}} {{whether it is}} completely accurate to think <b>of</b> the philosophical <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> consciousness as being switched-on or switched-off. It may be that, once consciousness is switched-on, it is then found in degrees in animals we deem conscious. In which case, consciousness {{is more like a}} switched-on rheostat, rather than a simple on–off switch. Christian de Quincey (2006) gives a list of what would be considered the marks of consciousness, including ‘experience, subjectivity, sentience, feeling, or mentality of any kind’. He also seems to conflate awareness with experience when speaking about the light of consciousness being on. In keeping with de Quincey’s desire to get clear about the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> consciousness, I will put forward an idea of consciousness as the experience of oneself as a being subject to past, present, and future events, and contrast this idea with a state of awareness. De Quincey claims that ‘any entity that is a subject — that feels its own being — possesses consciousness’. I want to add to this <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> consciousness by <b>noting</b> the subject’s sense of temporality, so as to further qualify the <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> consciousness and show how awareness is distinct from consciousness. Further, for me, the psychological dimension is also an ontological category that includes all of what de Quincey means by consciousness, with the qualification that awareness, cognition, sentience, perception, and feeling are psychological states, though not states of consciousness. Nonetheless, these psychological states may b...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} the concept of ‘governance’ has become a widely used concept within {{political}} science discourse. Although the <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> ‘governance’ are contested, its position of influence is rarely questioned. This paper contends that the term exercises a prescriptive influence that shapes understandings about how governing should be interpreted and executed in the current era. The paper begins by examining briefly several prominent ‘narratives of governance’ that currently frame contemporary understandings of the term’s significance. Attention then turns {{to an analysis of}} the return of ‘governance’, conceptually speaking, to the discourse of political science in Australia. The paper identifies when this began to occur and then examines the conceptual load that scholars expected ‘governance’ to carry at that time. These meanings are then counterpoised against the currently dominant cluster <b>of</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>noted</b> earlier in the paper to illustrate that they are not the only ways of interpreting how ‘governance’ should be understood. Furthermore, it will also be suggested that these hegemonic meanings represent a trajectory that, paradoxically, de-politicises what was once a clearly politicised term...|$|R

500|$|Given that llwyd is {{the usual}} word for [...] "grey" [...] in the Welsh {{language}} and that Welsh speakers would {{have been exposed to}} the English word [...] "mare", an alternative suggestion considered by Peate was that the term Mari Lwyd had originally meant [...] "Grey Mare". This etymological explanation would have parallels with the name of a similar hooded horse tradition found in Ireland and the Isle of Man, which is known in Irish as the Láir Bhán and in Manx as the Laare Vane, in both cases meaning [...] "White Mare". Initially believing that [...] "there is much to be said for this suggestion", Peate later embraced it fully. Cawte similarly believed that that [...] "Grey Mare" [...] was the most likely original <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> the term, <b>noting</b> that the Mari Lwyd appeared to represent a horse and that similar hobby horse customs in neighbouring England, such as the hoodening tradition of East Kent, also made reference to horses with their name.
