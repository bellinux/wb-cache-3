5|$|The {{control of}} Vijithapura was {{essential}} to both sides. The loss of the stronghold would be a largely demoralizing factor for Elara's forces and would significantly reduce their capability to resist Duthhagamani's advance. For Dutthagamani's forces, the capture of the city would <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could easily move on to Anuradhapura.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} under which {{circumstances}} Neferhotep I died after his reign of eleven years. His successor was his brother, Sobekhotep IV, who {{is perhaps the most}} important ruler of the 13th Dynasty. Another brother, Sihathor, appears in the Turin canon as successor, but it seems that he only reigned for a few months as coregent with Neferhotep I and never became an independent ruler, likely because he predeceased his elder brother. After this, it is possible that Neferhotep I designated his younger brother Sobekhotep IV as coregent. There are two inscriptions from Sehel showing Neferhotep I, Sihathor and Sobekhotep IV, which could <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> reigned for some time together, although Sihathor is declared dead on both lists. Another piece of evidence is an inscription from the Wadi Hammamat showing the cartouches of Neferhotep I and Sobekhotep IV on par, next to each other. Some Egyptologists see this as evidence of a coregency between these two kings, while others, including Ryholt, reject this interpretation and believe the inscription was made by Sobekhotep to honour his deceased brother.|$|E

5|$|Spreckels and his {{partners}} William G. Irwin and F. F. Low formed the Spreckels & Company Bank in Hawaii in 1884, for the specific purpose of circulating the silver coins. The first Hawaiian silver coin {{known to have been}} spent, a half dollar, was found among the receipts at the Honolulu Music Hall on January 10, 1884. It was placed in a pendant and given to the leading lady. The new coinage went into general circulation on January 14, with coins available at the Hawaiian Treasury and at Spreckels' new bank in Honolulu. There was considerable demand, and the coins (all of which were received by June 1884) displaced American quarter dollars and half dollars in circulation, something taken (depending on political position) to <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were accepted, or that Gresham's Law (bad money drives out good) was in operation. The Hawaiian Treasury had been almost out of cash before receiving the coins, and they entered commerce as the government paid for goods and services, increasing the money supply and risking inflation. Within six months of issue, the coins traded against American currency at a discount of 2 percent.|$|E

25|$|Peter Singer, a bioethicist {{and author}} of Animal Liberation {{published}} in 1975, suggested that consciousness {{is not necessarily the}} key issue: just because animals have smaller brains, or are ‘less conscious’ than humans, does not <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are not capable of feeling pain. He goes on further to argue that we do not assume newborn infants, people suffering from neurodegenerative brain diseases or people with learning disabilities experience less pain than we would.|$|E

25|$|The {{classical}} rabbis {{interpreted the}} biblical phrase heed my ordinance (Hebrew: ushmartem et mishmarti), which {{appears in the}} holiness code, to <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> should (metaphorically) create a protective fence around the biblical laws, an attitude particularly expressed by The Ethics of the Fathers (a Mishnaic tractate discussing the ethics surrounding adherence to biblical rules). Nevertheless, the rabbis of the classical and Middle Ages also introduced a number of leniencies. Another prohibition on mixtures in Jewish law is kil'ayim.|$|E
25|$|Additionally it {{has been}} {{pointed out that the}} lack of mention of the Suevi could <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were not per se an older {{distinct}} ethnic group, but the result of a recent ethnogenesis, with many smaller groups -among them also part of the Quadi and Marcomanni- coming together during the migration from the Danube valley to the Iberian Peninsula. Other groups of Sueves are mentioned by Jordanes and other historians as residing by the Danube regions during the 5th and 6th centuries.|$|E

Actions had immediate effects in one's current life but without any moral traces, and both the action and the effect was predetermined, according to the Ajivikas.|$|E

25|$|In June 1459 a Great Council {{was summoned}} to meet at Coventry.

But even the very first tests demonstrated that the calibration changed with wavelength. This <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would either have to make multiple calibration tables, one for each wavelength, or that if a single table of corrections for different bearings was desired, the antennas would have to be moved vertically as the wavelength was changed.|$|E
25|$|The Toegye School, {{founded by}} Yi Hwang, {{believed}} that Li (rationality) was absolute, while Qi (material) was relative (this, however, does not <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{believed that the}} Li was in any way superior to the Qi). They also believed that the Li and the Qi were completely different, and that the human ethics were Li (rational), while the human emotions were Qi (material). The latter idea was attacked by Yi I, who believed that ethics were just a positive side of the emotions. The Toegye School were {{the majority of the}} Southerners, and remained the contender of the Giho School to the eighteenth century.|$|E
