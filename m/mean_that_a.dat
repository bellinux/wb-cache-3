This may <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> feather covering was not ubiquitous in this group of dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|This {{does not}} <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> Category5 {{hurricane}} cannot form outside of an El Niño event. The entire year of 1959 was neither an El Niño or a La Niña, {{but it had}} one Category5 hurricane (Patsy). Most of 1973 was during a La Niña, which reduces tropical cyclone activity in the eastern Pacific, yet Hurricane Ava, a Category 5 hurricane, formed in June of that year.|$|E
5|$|He {{finds the}} mixture of bird species {{intermediate}} between those of Java and Australia, with 36 species actually Javan, and 11 closely related; while there are only 13 actually Australian, with 35 closely related. Wallace interprets this to <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> small number of birds from Australia, and a larger number from Java, colonised Timor and then evolved into new species endemic to the island. The land mammals were very few in number: the six species were endemic or related to those of Java or the Moluccas, with none from Australia, so he doubts {{there was ever a}} land bridge to that continent.|$|E

5|$|Kant {{believed}} that the shared ability of humans to reason should {{be the basis of}} morality, and that it is the ability to reason that makes humans morally significant. He, therefore, {{believed that}} all humans {{should have the right to}} common dignity and respect. Margaret Eaton argues that, according to Kant's ethics, a medical professional must be happy for their own practices to be used by and on anyone, even if they were the patient themselves. For example, a researcher who wished to perform tests on patients without their knowledge must be happy for all researchers to do so. She also argues that Kant's requirement of autonomy would <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> patient must be able to make a fully informed decision about treatment, making it immoral to perform tests on unknowing patients. Medical research should be motivated out of respect for the patient, so they must be informed of all facts, even if this would be likely to dissuade the patient. Jeremy Sugarman has argued that Kant's formulation of autonomy requires that patients are never used merely for the benefit of society, but are always treated as rational people with their own goals. Aaron Hinkley notes that a Kantian account of autonomy requires respect for choices that are arrived at rationally, not for choices which are arrived at by idiosyncratic or non-rational means. He argues that there may be some difference between what a purely rational agent would choose and what a patient actually chooses, the difference being the result of non-rational idiosyncrasies. Although a Kantian physician ought not to lie to or coerce a patient, Hinkley suggests that some form of paternalism - such as through withholding information which may prompt a non-rational response - could be acceptable.|$|E

25|$|In {{many cases}} the Cookery Collection at Leeds University Library holds long {{sequences}} of editions of outstanding works by popular authors such as Mrs Beeton and Hannah Glasse. These long runs and multiple copies <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> text’s development across editions can be studied. Innovations {{and changes in the}} book and printing industry can also be observed.|$|E

25|$|Expressive adequacy. The {{standard}} that Brachman and most AI researchers use to measure expressive adequacy is usually First Order Logic (FOL).

25|$|Pneumocystis {{infection}} {{can also}} be diagnosed by immunofluorescent or histochemical staining of the specimen, and more recently by molecular analysis of polymerase chain reaction products comparing DNA samples.

25|$|The PS Waverley {{first arrived}} in Ilfracombe in 1887, after her owners Messrs P. and A. Campbell brought her to Bristol as their first {{pleasure}} steamer to work the Bristol Channel. Deterioration of the wooden pier and part demolition during the Second World War <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> new pier was required. The wood was replaced with reinforced concrete and car parking space was increased. The new pier was opened on 6 July 1952.|$|E

25|$|Next Thamyras sings. He {{invokes the}} Muses, and sings that {{the riches of}} Helicon and an Apollo are here. He also invokes Troy, and sings that its fall was all worth it. The meaning is unclear, but it is usually {{interpreted}} to <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> new poem {{has been written about}} Troy (possibly by Caesar himself). Thamyras sings of how Homer crowns Caesar with his own crown and Mantua tears up its writings.|$|E
25|$|Egersund Station {{has been}} {{proposed}} moved back to its old location for the commuter rail, giving Egersund two stations: one for commuter trains and one for regional trains. The right-of-way still exists for this route, making construction easy. A new Sørlandet Line has also been proposed, which would run south instead of north from Egersund. This would <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> city center location for Egersund Station {{would be better for}} intercity trains as well.|$|E
25|$|In the 2001 case Re Kevin – {{validity}} of marriage of transsexual, the Family Court of Australia recognised {{the right of}} transsexual people to marry according to their current gender {{as opposed to the}} gender of their birth; this did not permit same-sex marriage {{from the perspective of the}} genders the couple identifies as, but it did <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> male-to-female transsexual could legally marry a man, and a female-to-male transsexual could legally marry a woman.|$|E

25|$|In general, logical {{consequence}} in first-order {{logic is}} only semidecidable: if a sentence A logically implies a sentence B then {{this can be}} discovered (for example, by searching for a proof until one is found, using some effective, sound, complete proof system). However, if A does not logically imply B, this does not <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>A</b> logically implies the negation of B. There is no effective procedure that, given formulas A and B, always correctly decides whether A logically implies B.|$|E
25|$|Gilgamesh {{tells his}} mother Ninsun about two dreams he had. His mother {{explains}} that they <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> new companion will soon arrive at Uruk.

Enkidu helps the shepherds by guarding the sheep. They travel to Uruk to confront Gilgamesh and stop his abuses. Enkidu and Gilgamesh battle but Gilgamesh breaks off the fight. Enkidu praises Gilgamesh.|$|E
25|$|Mezuzah: Deuteronomy 6:9 is {{sometimes}} interpreted to <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> mezuzah {{needs to be}} placed on the doorposts of a house.

25|$|The high {{temperatures}} and pressures also <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> higher throughput can be achieved, however thermal efficiency is somewhat lower as the gas must be cooled {{before it can}} be cleaned with existing technology. The {{high temperatures}} also mean that tar and methane are not present in the product gas; however the oxygen requirement is higher than for the other types of gasifiers. All entrained flow gasifiers remove the major part of the ash as a slag as the operating temperature is well above the ash fusion temperature.|$|E
25|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is {{promoting}} {{the marketing of}} greener cars via the SmartWay program. The SmartWay and SmartWay Elite designation <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> vehicle is a better environmental performer relative to other vehicles. This US EPA designation is arrived at by taking into account a vehicle's Air Pollution Score and Greenhouse Gas Score. Higher Air Pollution Scores indicate vehicles that emit lower amounts of pollutants that cause smog relative to other vehicles. Higher Greenhouse Gas Scores indicate vehicles that emit lower amounts {{of carbon dioxide and}} have improved fuel economy relative to other vehicles.|$|E
25|$|The {{right to}} be heard refers to the right for a party's case to be heard before a {{decision}} is made. Even if a statute does not state the requirement for a hearing, it does not necessarily <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> hearing will never be required. However, this right is neither automatic nor absolute. For instance, in Yong Vui Kong, the Court of Appeal noted that at common law a convicted offender seeking mercy had no {{right to be}} heard during the clemency process. In Singapore, this situation is reflected by the absence of any provision in Article 22P of the Constitution for an offender to be heard during the clemency process.|$|E
