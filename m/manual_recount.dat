2500|$|At 4:00p.m. EST on December 8, the Florida Supreme Court, by a 4 to 3 vote, {{ordered a}} <b>manual</b> <b>recount,</b> under the {{supervision}} of the Leon County Circuit Court, of disputed ballots in all Florida counties and the portion of Miami-Dade county in which such a recount was not already complete. That decision was announced on live worldwide television by the Florida Supreme Court's spokesman Craig Waters, the Court's public information officer. The Court further ordered that only undervotes be considered. [...] The results of this tally were to be added to the November 14 tally. [...] This count was in progress on December 9, when the United States Supreme Court 5-4 (Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer dissenting) granted Bush's emergency plea for a stay of the Florida Supreme Court recount ruling, stopping the incomplete recount.|$|E
5000|$|While the Bush {{campaign}} {{opposed the}} Gore campaign’s requests for <b>manual</b> <b>recounts</b> in four heavily Democratic counties, they quietly accepted <b>manual</b> <b>recounts</b> from four Republican-leaning counties. Polk, Hamilton, Seminole, and Taylor Counties, which used the more reliable optical scanners, decided to manually examine unreadable ballots (both undervotes and overvotes) during the counties' electronic recounts, {{in accordance with}} those counties' existing policies (see County-by-county standards below). These manual counts garnered Bush {{a net gain of}} 185 votes.|$|R

5000|$|As the <b>manual</b> <b>recounts</b> continued, {{the battle}} to certify the results intensified. On November 17, Judge Terry Lewis of Leon County Circuit Court {{permitted}} Harris to certify the election results without the <b>manual</b> <b>recounts,</b> but {{on the same day}} the Florida Supreme Court stayed that decision until it could consider an appeal by Gore. On November 21, the Florida Supreme Court ruled unanimously that manual counts in Broward, Palm Beach and Miami-Dade Counties must be included and set 5:00 p.m. on November 26 as the earliest time for certification. After that decision, the Bush campaign appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that the state court effectively rewrote state election statutes after the vote.|$|R
2500|$|On November 8, 2000, the Florida Division of Elections {{reported}} that Bush won with 48.8% {{of the vote}} in Florida, a margin of victory of 1,784 votes. The margin of victory was less than 0.5% of the votes cast, so a statutorily-mandated automatic machine recount occurred. On November 10, with the machine recount finished in all but one county, Bush's margin of victory had decreased to 327. According to legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, later analysis showed that a total of 18 counties—accounting for a quarter of all votes cast in Florida—did not carry out the legally mandated machine recount, but [...] "o one from the Gore campaign ever challenged" [...] the notion that the machine recount had been completed. Florida's election laws allow a candidate to request a county to conduct a <b>manual</b> <b>recount,</b> and Gore requested manual recounts in four Florida counties: Volusia, Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade, which are counties that traditionally vote Democratic and would be expected to garner more votes for Gore. Gore did not, however, request any recounts in counties that traditionally vote Republican. The four counties granted the request and began manual recounts. However, Florida law also required all counties to certify their election returns to the Florida Secretary of State within seven days of the election, and several of the counties conducting manual recounts did not believe they could meet this deadline. On November 14, the statutory deadline, the Florida Circuit Court ruled that the seven-day deadline was mandatory, but that the counties could amend their returns at a later date. The court also ruled that the Secretary, after [...] "considering all attendant facts and circumstances," [...] had discretion to include any late amended returns in the statewide certification. [...] Before the 5pm deadline on November 14, Volusia County completed its <b>manual</b> <b>recount</b> and certified its results. At 5pm on November 14, Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris announced that she had received the certified returns from all 67 counties, while Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade counties were still conducting manual recounts.|$|E

On July 8, 2006, López Obrador called for nationwide protests to ask for a recount of all votes, stating that [...] "the government would be responsible for any flare-up of anger after officials rejected his demand for a <b>manual</b> <b>recount</b> of Sunday's extremely close vote." ...|$|E

Gore asserted that Harris had disregarded <b>manual</b> <b>recount</b> results in four Florida counties. The Florida Supreme Court responded to Gore's challenge by holding that Harris {{had to wait until}} November 26 to certify the winner, and that she must include the <b>manual</b> <b>recount</b> results.

Other E2E voting systems such as Punchscan and ThreeBallot, address these issues but require existing polling place equipment and procedures to be greatly altered or replaced. In contrast, Scantegrity is an add-on meant to be used in conjunction with existing optical scan equipment, thereby requiring fewer hardware and software and procedural modifications. For all other voters, the ballot marking procedure is essentially identical to conventional optical scan paper-ballots.
