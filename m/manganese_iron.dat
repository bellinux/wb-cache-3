5|$|Sediments {{of certain}} abyssal plains contain {{abundant}} mineral resources, notably polymetallic nodules. These potato-sized concretions of <b>manganese,</b> <b>iron,</b> nickel, cobalt, and copper, distributed on the seafloor at depths of greater than 4000meters, are of significant commercial interest. The area of maximum commercial interest for polymetallic nodule mining (called the Pacific nodule province) lies in international {{waters of the}} Pacific Ocean, stretching from 118°–157°, and from 9°–16°N, an area of more than 3 million km². The abyssal Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone (CCFZ) is an area within the Pacific nodule province that is currently under exploration for its mineral potential.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of the abyssal plain {{is the result of}} the spreading of the seafloor (plate tectonics) and the melting of the lower oceanic crust. Magma rises from above the asthenosphere (a layer of the upper mantle), and as this basaltic material reaches the surface at mid-ocean ridges, it forms new oceanic crust, which is constantly pulled sideways by spreading of the seafloor. Abyssal plains result from the blanketing of an originally uneven surface of oceanic crust by fine-grained sediments, mainly clay and silt. Much of this sediment is deposited by turbidity currents that have been channelled from the continental margins along submarine canyons into deeper water. The rest is composed chiefly of pelagic sediments. Metallic nodules are common in some areas of the plains, with varying concentrations of metals, including <b>manganese,</b> <b>iron,</b> nickel, cobalt, and copper.|$|E
40|$|Many {{full-time}} welders {{experience some}} sort of respiratory disorder e. g., asthma, bronchitis and metal fume fever. Thus, welding aerosols are thought to cause airway inflammation. There {{is a need for}} markers of welding aerosols in exposure assessments, and as most welding aerosols contain <b>manganese</b> and <b>iron,</b> these metals may possibly be used as an indicator. We have previously developed a novel non-invasive technique to collect endogenous particles in exhaled air (PEx). This study is designed to (i) develop a method for analysis of <b>manganese</b> and <b>iron</b> in PEx and (ii) investigate whether the <b>manganese</b> and/or <b>iron</b> content of PEx changes after exposure to welding aerosols. Methods: nine individuals were experimentally exposed to welding fumes. PEx was collected at three time points for each individual; before, after and 24 hours after exposure. Analyses of PEx samples were performed using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Results: four out of nine individuals showed an increase in <b>manganese</b> and <b>iron</b> levels after exposure to welding aerosols. The mean <b>manganese</b> and <b>iron</b> concentration increased from, <LOD to 82 – 84 pg L− 1 (range from 0 to LOD for values <LOD) and 20 – 86 to 2600 pg L− 1 of exhaled air respectively. Conclusions: an ICP-MS method for analysis of <b>manganese</b> and <b>iron</b> in PEx has been developed. The method could easily be expanded to include other trace metals of interest, such as cadmium, nickel or chromium.

5|$|Although the {{proportion}} of bal maidens in the workforce fell steadily, the mining boom {{of the first half}} of the 19thcentury took the total number to between 4,000 and 14,400 by the 1840s. The 1841 Census (the first full census of England) shows 3,250 women working in the mines, but the mine returns of the same year show over 5,000 women in the tin, lead and copper mines of Cornwall and West Devon. Increased mechanisation of the ore dressing process and public concerns over subjecting women and children to the harsh working conditions of the mines meant that {{the proportion}} of bal maidens in the workforce continued to fall, and it is generally accepted that by 1850 between 15 and 20% of mine workers were female. By the 1861 census, coinciding with the peak of the Cornish mining industry, a minimum of 6,000 women were working in mining in Cornwall, at least 2,500 of whom worked within a five-mile radius of Camborne. Although employed primarily in copper and tin mines, bal maidens also worked in lead, zinc, <b>manganese,</b> <b>iron,</b> antimony, wolfram, and uranium mines, and in slate and china clay quarries.|$|E

40|$|Acesso restrito: Texto completo. p. 259 - 263 A slurry {{sampling}} flame {{atomic absorption}} spectrometric method is {{proposed for the}} determination of copper, <b>manganese</b> and <b>iron</b> in oysters (Crassostrea rhizophora), clams (Anomalocardia brasiliana) and mussels (Mytella guiyanensis; Perna perna). Optimization was carried out using univariate methodology involving the following variables: nature and concentration of the acid solution for slurry preparation, sonication time and sample mass. The optimized conditions were 80 mg of sample ground in a cryogenic mil, dilution using 1. 0 mol L 1 nitric /hydrochloric acid solution, sonication time of 30 min and a slurry volume of 10 mL. The calibration curves had been prepared using standards of copper, <b>manganese</b> and <b>iron</b> also in 1. 0 molL 1 nitric/hydrochloric acid solution. This method allowed the determination of copper, <b>manganese</b> and <b>iron</b> by FAAS, with detection limits of 0. 17, 0. 09 and 0. 46 mg g 1, respectively. The precision, expressed as relative standard deviation (RSD), are 3. 0 %, 2. 9 % and 3. 8 % (n ¼ 10), for concentrations of copper, <b>manganese</b> and <b>iron</b> of 17, 22 and 719 mgg 1, respectively.

25|$|Experimenting {{with the}} new technology, the forest glassmakers found it {{difficult}} to achieve the high standards of clarity and colour of the Roman methods, due mainly to the great variability of colour-controlling elements in the raw materials. European sand and soil is generally higher in iron and <b>manganese.</b> <b>Iron</b> gives a blue-green tinge to glass under usual furnace atmosphere conditions, but also may give a yellow colour. Manganese has its own purple colour which may balance out the iron colour to make colourless glass. For instance, glass made from beech wood grown on meagre lime-rich soil (e.g. Kleinlutzel, Jura) is high in manganese and thus, nearly colourless while that in a clay-rich area (e.g. Court-Chalvet, Jura) is olive green. Thus, a variety of colours may be produced and experimentation allowed the glassmakers to progress from the early muddy green-yellow-brown colours toward clear-coloured and colourless glass. Local conditions allowed some areas to produce finer glass at an earlier stage. In Bohemia {{at the end of the}} sixteenth century the decolourising powers of manganese were used to produce a clear glass suitable for engraving. The amount of carbon left in the wood ash also may affect the colour of the glass by modifying the furnace atmosphere. The glass in York Minster has been shown to be 90% naturally coloured, without added colorants.|$|E
