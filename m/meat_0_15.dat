The paper analyzes the issue of the use of hormones in the feed for farm animals, existing threats and risks to human health, determines the maximum allowable levels of clenbuterol residues and ractopamine in the animal products, describes the existing methods for determining the content of beta-agonists physical-chemical and chemical-biological methods. The objects of investigation were frozen beef slabs, beef liver, milk. The content of ractopamine and clenbuterol in the samples was determined by ELISA method. Based on the data basic the metrological characteristics of the determination of clenbuterol in animal products were established – the detectable concentration range from 0. 04 to 2000 ng/kg, the relative standard deviation of repeatability <b>0.</b> 8 % (<b>meat),</b> <b>0.</b> 7 % (milk), the relative standard deviation of intermediate precision of 1. <b>0</b> % (<b>meat),</b> <b>0.</b> 9 % (milk), and ractopamine – detectable concentration range from 0. 02 to 8, 100 ng/kg, the relative standard deviation of repeatability <b>0.</b> 3 % (<b>meat),</b> <b>0.</b> 4 % (beef liv er), the relative standard deviation of the interme-diate precision of <b>0.</b> 8 % (<b>meat)</b> and <b>0.</b> 9 % (beef liver).

An accelerating aging of three different samples, two commercial and one laboratory grade UHMWPE purchased from Sigma Aldrich was done to study  the thermal stability of UHMWPE, and the results were checked with FTIR spectroscopy. The FTIR data revealed that UHWMPE purchased from Sigma Aldrich had the highest thermal stability. Therefore, UHMWPE purchased from Sigma Aldrich was used for further studies and preparation of nano composites with 1 wt% and 2 wt% Mg <b>0.</b> <b>15</b> Ni <b>0.</b> <b>15</b> Zn <b>0.</b> 70 Fe 2 O 3 using the ball milling method. FTIR data show significant alterations as far as material degradation and crosslinking is concerned. The absorbance in the region 1650 - 1850 cm- 1 and 3000 - 3700 cm- 1 significantly increases due to the enhance of CH 2 bending to stretching ratio with the incorporation of Mg <b>0.</b> <b>15</b> Ni <b>0.</b> <b>15</b> Zn <b>0.</b> 70 Fe 2 O 3. As far as thermal stability is concerned, composites with 1 % of Mg <b>0.</b> <b>15</b> Ni <b>0.</b> <b>15</b> Zn <b>0.</b> 70 Fe 2 O 3 contents were less stable compared to pure UHMWPE and UHMWPE composites with 2 wt% of nano scale Mg <b>0.</b> <b>15</b> Ni <b>0.</b> <b>15</b> Zn <b>0.</b> 70 Fe 2 O 3. The degree of crystallinity obtained from DSC data was 41 %, 40 %, and 43 % for UHMWPE, UHMWPE+ 1 % of Mg <b>0.</b> <b>15</b> Ni <b>0.</b> <b>15</b> Zn <b>0.</b> 70 Fe 2 O 3, and UHMWPE+ 2 % of Mg <b>0.</b> <b>15</b> Ni <b>0.</b> <b>15</b> Zn <b>0.</b> 70 Fe 2 O 3, respectively.

40|$|Ultra high {{molecular}} weight polyethylene has been commonly used as a biomaterial for hip and knee implants. This thesis concerns optical and three phase morphology of nano composites of ultra {{high molecular}} weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) with Mg <b>0.</b> <b>15</b> Ni <b>0.</b> <b>15</b> Zn <b>0.</b> 70 Fe 2 O 3 using analytical techniques such as UV-visible spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Muller matrix spectro-polarimeter has been used to study the absorption behavior over the visible spectral range i. e. 400 - 800 nm. The results show significant changes in the absorption behavior of UHMWPE/Zn nano ferrite samples. To analyze these changes in pure and UHMWPE/Zn-nano ferrite composites, the Urbach edge method was used for the calculation of optical activation energy. Moreover, direct and indirect energy band gaps, and the number of carbon atoms in C=C unsaturation have been evaluated by using the modified Urbach formula and Tauc’s equation, respectively. The results show that the optical activation energy decreases more with the addition of 2 wt% Mg <b>0.</b> <b>15</b> Ni <b>0.</b> <b>15</b> Zn <b>0.</b> 70 Fe 2 O 3 than 1 wt% of Mg <b>0.</b> <b>15</b> Ni <b>0.</b> <b>15</b> Zn <b>0.</b> 70 Fe 2 O 3. The values of direct and indirect energy band gaps are also found to decrease more with 2 wt% of Mg <b>0.</b> <b>15</b> Ni <b>0.</b> <b>15</b> Zn <b>0.</b> 70 Fe 2 O 3. Furthermore, indirect energy gaps are found to have lower values as compared to direct energy gaps.

We found in both experiments a “ <b>0.</b> <b>15</b> -Hz rhythm” exhibiting periods of spindle waves (increasing and decreasing amplitudes), phase synchronized with respiration at 1 : 2 and 1 : 1 integer number ratios. At times of wave-epochs and n:m phase synchronization, the <b>0.</b> <b>15</b> -Hz rhythm appeared in heart rate and arterial blood pressure. As phase synchronization of the <b>0.</b> <b>15</b> -Hz rhythm with respiration was established at a 1 : 1 integer number ratio, all cardiovascular-respiratory oscillations were synchronized at <b>0.</b> <b>15</b> Hz.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Some {{but not all}} {{epidemiological}} studies have reported that high intakes of red and processed meat are {{associated with an increased}} risk of colorectal cancer. In the UK Dietary Cohort Consortium, we examined associations of meat, poultry and fish intakes with colorectal cancer risk using standardised individual dietary data pooled from seven UK prospective studies. METHODS: Four- to seven-day food diaries were analysed, disaggregating the weights of meat, poultry and fish from composite foods to investigate dose-response relationships. We identified 579 cases of colorectal cancer and matched with 1, 996 controls on age, sex and recruitment date. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios for colorectal cancer associated with meat, poultry and fish intakes, adjusting for relevant covariables. RESULTS: Disaggregated intakes were moderately low, e. g. mean red meat intakes were 38. 2 g/day among male and 28. 7 g/day among female controls. There was little evidence of association between the food groups examined and risk for colorectal cancer: Odds ratios (95 % confidence intervals) for a 50 g/day increase were 1. 01 (0. 84 - 1. 22) for red <b>meat,</b> <b>0.</b> 88 (0. 68 - 1. <b>15)</b> for processed <b>meat,</b> <b>0.</b> 97 (0. 84 - 1. 12) for red and processed <b>meat</b> combined, <b>0.</b> 80 (0. 65 - 1. 00) for poultry, 0. 92 (0. 70 - 1. 21) for white fish and 0. 89 (0. 70 - 1. 13) for fatty fish.
