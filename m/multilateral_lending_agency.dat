40|$|As an {{official}} <b>multilateral</b> <b>lending</b> <b>agency,</b> the IMF has {{a daunting task}} to keep its finances in balance. Its mandate requires it to lend to countries in difficult financial straits after private sector lenders have pulled out and official bilateral lenders have become wary of the risks. In the 1990 s, the rapid growth and increasing complexity and instability {{of international trade and}} capital flows raised the stakes immensely. The value of world trade more than doubled from the 1980 s to the 1990 s. The aggregate current account deficit of all deficit countries rose from $ 223 billion a year in the 1980 s to $ 366 billion in the 1990 s. The size and volatility of international financial flows grew much more rapidly. In response, IMF credit outstanding rose from $ 28 billion to $ 41 billion. Despite the size of new lending, the Fund was covering a smaller portion of its members ’ financial needs. Raising the capital to keep this contribution from shrinking further provided a constant challenge throughout the decade. The Financial Evolution of the IMF The IMF began life in 1946 as a single fund: a pool of financial resources deposited by its member countries, mostly in the form of gold, U. S. dollars, and countries ’ own currencies. Those nondollar currency balances were {{a major part of the}} IMF’s assets, even though they were—at the time—not traded or convertible internationally and therefore not usable for IMF lending. Over time, the number of “usable currencies” gradually grew. The financial assets of what eventually became the General Depart-ment of the IMF comprised gold, usable currencies, and other currencies. The First Amendment of the Articles of Agreement, adopted in 1969, enabled the IMF to allocate (i. e., issue) special drawing rights (SDRs) through a separate SDR Department, which then had its own balance sheet. 1 Beginning in 1976, the IMF 1 The division of the IMF’s accounts into separate “departments ” (General and SDR) should not be confused with the organizational division into area and functional departments such as the African Department and the Fiscal Affairs Department.

40|$|Government-owned {{and privately}} owned water systems are key {{components}} of a nation’s infrastructure. How managers and government policymakers address information asymmetries has {{a significant impact on}} sector performance. This paper explores issues facing a firm that is considering private participation in the water sector. The various risk factors and risk-mitigation techniques are identified. Risk factors include technical and operational problems, commercial and financial concerns, human capital and personnel issues, regulatory governance and incentive issues, and environmental issues. In response to these risks, multinational firms have several strategies for limiting exposure and gaining experience in a number of countries. Contractual arrangements range from service contracts to concessions to full ownership. Organizational responses to these risks attempt to deal with internal information issues and regulatory rules. To illustrate the importance of economic and political issues facing water utilities, we present an overview of Peruvian water utilities. In this case of (currently) government-owned utilities, the regulatory agency, SUNASS, has a limited set of instruments for addressing pricing, investment, and quality of service.

40|$|The case {{examines}} {{efforts by}} the Chinese government and local authorities to restore the Huiahe River, a 1, 000 kilometer waterway which runs through four provinces in eastern China. The river basin, covering an area of some 270, 000 square kilometers, is home to almost 150 million people and {{represents one of the}} most important areas of agricultural output in China. As a result of rapid economic development, the river has, over the past twenty years, become seriously polluted. This has had dire consequences for industries that depend on the river, notably agriculture and fishing. As well, the limited groundwater supplies in eastern China have meant that surface water has always been an important source of supply for residential and industrial uses. The pollution of the Huaihe has therefore had serious public health consequences. In mid- 1995, the Chinese government formally adopted an ambitious plan to restore the water quality in the river. The case is based on material gathered from secondary sources, supplemented by interviews conducted with government officials and company managers in Beijing and Anhui province in China. The case begins with an overview of the impact of economic growth on the Chinese environment, and the steps which China has taken to address its growing environmental challenges. The case then focuses on the plan as proposed by the Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences (CRAES). The case goes on to describe some of the early implementation measures taken as part of the plan, in particular the forced closure of hundreds of small factories that have sprung up along the banks of the river. The case outlines the various stakeholders affected by the plan and its ultimate success or failure. These include local residents and businesses, various Chinese government ministries, <b>multilateral</b> <b>lending</b> <b>agencies</b> and international suppliers of anti-pollution technologies. The ultimate success of the plan is, at the time of this writing, not known. Future issues and questions that will affect the plan's success are then described. These include resistance by some elements of the Chinese government concerned about foreign debts incurred to finance the cleanup plan; local officials who may not wish to sacrifice short-term economic growth for environmental protection; and businesses concerned about the financial burden of having to install new clean technologies. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{foundation}} {{structures for}} telecommunications in the English-speaking Caribbean were laid {{during the period}} of direct colonial control of the region by Britain. They formed part of the global communications network of a large empire requiring quick and efficient links with a remote imperial Centre. In this thesis, we argue, however, that the Caribbean component of this colonial telecommunications system was designed not just to improve imperial political administration of a distant and scattered region, but even more directly in support of a Nineteenth century drive for increased British private capital accumulation in Central and South America. We indicate that in the process of penetrating the Caribbean territories, the early British multinational telegraph conglomerates received the direct financial and technical support of their British home government, in a meso-corporatist relationship designed to counter both United States and other European competition in the region. The company Cable and Wireless emerged, both as an end-product of this inter-imperialist competition, and as an attempt to rationalize the innovation of wireless telegraphy with the more established cable network interests. Political de-colonization and the growth in the influence of the large colonial Dominions led to a fracturing of the symbiotic relationship between the private telegraph interests and the Imperial state. Nationalization of the industry, which followed, eventually led to more autonomous control by the Dominions over the telecommunications systems within their national territories. This marked the end of the empire-wide remit of the state-owned Cable and Wireless. But we argue that monopoly control over the telecommunications systems of the smaller, less powerful colonies, such as those in the Caribbean, was awarded to the diminished Cable and Wireless as a concession for its loss. However, despite close to three decades {{since the start of the}} process of political independence in the region, and early attempts by some governments to gain national control through equity acquisition, the dominance of Cable and Wireless continues to increase. In the last decade, the increase in the company's dominance has been facilitated by Western <b>multilateral</b> <b>lending</b> <b>agencies,</b> particularly the International Monetary Fund (IMF), whose loan conditions and demands for privatization in the sector have mediated on the side of the entrenched multinational company, in the same way that the British imperial government mediated on its behalf during Colonialism.

40|$|Why should <b>multilateral</b> <b>lending</b> {{exist in}} a world where private capital markets are well {{developed}} and governments have their own bilateral aid programmes? If lending by the World Bank, IMF, and regional development banks has an independent rationale, it must rest on advantages generated by the multilateral nature of these institutions. There are in principle two such advantages. First, since information on the quality of investment environments in different countries is in many ways a collective good, multilateral agencies are {{in a better position to}} internalize the externalities that may arise. This creates a rationale for <b>multilateral</b> <b>lending</b> in terms of information provision, and particularly in terms of monitoring government policies in recipient countries. Second, as long as multilateral agencies retain some degree of autonomy from the governments that own them, their interaction with recipient countries, while official in nature, can remain less politicized than inter-governmental links. This in turn endows multilateral agencies with an advantage in the exercise of conditionality, that is in lending that is conditional on changes in government policies. Neither of these two potential advantages of <b>multilateral</b> <b>lending</b> has much to do with <b>lending,</b> per se. <b>Multilateral</b> <b>lending</b> may be required to make these agencies tasks incentive compatible.
