40|$|This paper {{presents}} a systematical {{approach to the}} properties of wood impregnated with different waterbased melamine resins, to {{provide a basis for}} further research. Therefore, ten commercially available methylated <b>melamine</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> with increasing ratios of melamine to formaldehyde have been compared in respect of their influence in dimension stabilisation, sorption behaviour, formaldehyde emissions, and water repellency of the treated wood. The dimension stabilisation caused by resin molecules that penetrated the wooden cell wall correlated with the molar mass of the resins used for impregnation. The changes in the sorption isotherms were attributed to a bulking effect. Formaldehyde emissions during and after curing increased with an increasing ratio of formaldehyde to melamine in the resins...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} {{on behalf of the}} Momentive Specialty Chemicals Pty Ltd, Mt Maunganui. The aim of the {{investigation was}} to develop a method to analyse the formation of <b>melamine</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> <b>resins</b> via an in situ real time NMR experiment leading to quantitative NMR intensities of the resin up to the stages of its Industrial Resin Endpoint (IRE). In order to run an in situ reaction for the melamine formaldehyde resin system and monitor it in real time, both qualitative and quantitative NMR acquisition methods were required. The qualitative method was power gated and used to obtain results in situ and in real time. However to render it quantitative, it was necessary to develop a quantitative method which was initially executed to obtain a conversion factor for relating the qualitative results obtained in the in situ experiment to quantitative results performed by doing inverse gated NMR spectra on a final form of the resin. The development of this technique required the determination of the longitudinal relaxation times (T 1) of the species within the melamine reaction as these were required to derive the necessary repetition rates employed in the NMR acquisition methods. In general, this project involved the development of the above mentioned NMR analytical protocols with tailoring to run this type of experiment in a 5 mm NMR tube using a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer whereby previous research on urea and phenol formaldehyde resins and employing identical NMR methodologies had relied on analyses conducted in a 10 mm NMR tube on a 300 MHz NMR instrument. As a result, reaction profiles of the melamine resin reaction were obtained during a real time experiment. The reaction profiles of the addition stage of the melamine resin reaction showed that the increase in the methylol melamine species occurs very fast and is justified by the exponential decay of the methylene glycol species corresponding to the formaldehyde solution. The condensation stages of the resin reaction were also observed until the IRE. The reaction profiles of the ether and methylene bridge links are clearly given showing that ether linkages predominate in the addition stage and plateaus, and methylene linkages only increase after the addition stage of the reaction. They provided insight to the reaction progress corresponding to addition and condensation stages of the melamine resin reaction...|$|E

30|$|A {{practical}} {{approach to}} enhancing the fire retardancy of wood-based materials by adding fire-retardant chemicals to the glue was developed. Plywoods were manufactured using urea <b>melamine</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> mixed with ammonium pentaborate or dihydrogen phosphate. Treated plywoods had better incombustibility than untreated ones. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis clearly demonstrated {{the distribution of}} boron and phosphorus, which had migrated from the glue to the wood, contributing to better fire retardant properties. The cross-sectional micrographs from scanning electron microscopy showed that untreated specimens exhibited a foamy structure near the interface in the glue layer and the deformed structure of wood cells. The cell structure and cell wall thickness retained intact in the specimens treated with urea <b>melamine</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> mixed with ammonium pentaborate or dihydrogen phosphate. When observing {{the effect of the}} thickness of overlay veneers on incombustibility, a shorter glowing time was obtained from the specimens with a thicker surface layer when the fire retardant chemical was added at 2 %, but the differences were smaller at the higher chemical retention of 4 %.

To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} the additive agents such as polyethylene glycols (PEGs), <b>melamine</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> (MF-resin) and phenol <b>formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> (PF-resin) on the flow deformability of solid wood, free compression tests during heating were performed. Various molecular weights ranging from 200 to 20, 000 for PEGs and almost similar molecular weight around 380 for MF-resin and PF-resin were applied. It was found from the compression tests that the yield stress indicating wood cell deformation resistance was drastically decreased with smaller molecular PEGs in wood, whereas the initiation of flow behavior, which is derived from detachment/slippage between cells, occurred at lower pressure with larger molecular PEGs. For generating the flow behaviors of solid wood, smaller molecular resin/substance was not always suitable. Thermosetting agents also act as a plasticizer during heating and especially the PF-resin showed better softening effect as well as a promoter of flow behavior than the MF-resin with almost similar molecular weight. This indicates that it is important for generating flow behavior to consider affinity/compatibility of resin to wood constituents. A maximum flow deformation ratio in the tangential direction of wood reached 180 % when using PEG 20, 000 and MF-resin as an additive agent.

The overall aim {{of this investigation was}} to strengthen the role of timber as a building material by assessing the suitability of modified timber in construction applications by studying key properties such as density, modulus of elasticity (MOE), swelling/shrinkage behaviour and creep. This work comprises two parts: a pre-study and a main study. A large variety of material properties and their interactions were studied mainly on the small specimens, while the creep behaviour was studied on the full-scale specimens. In the pre-study, eight modification methods were screened: acetylation, maleoylation, succinylation, furfurylation, modification with N-methylol acryl amide, modification with reactive linseed oil derivatives, heat treatment in vegetable oil, and modification with methylated <b>melamine</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> <b>resin.</b> The wood materials were pine heart and sapwood, beech, birch and spruce. The specimen size was 10 x 10 x 200 mm. A total of 491 specimens were studied. A close interconnection between equilibrium moisture content, anti-swelling-efficiency and stiffness stabilisation was observed. The MOE appeared to be statistically unaffected, whereas the impact bending strength appeared to be reduced. The four modification methods used in the main study were acetylation (AC), heat treatment in vegetable oil (HT), furfurylation (FA) and modification with methylated <b>melamine</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> (MMF). The wood material was sapwood of Scots pine. A total of 2449 small specimens (10 x 10 x 200 mm) and 132 full-scale specimens (45 x 70 x 1100 mm) were tested. Significant changes in material properties took place. AC increased the density and reduced the equilibrium moisture content (EMC), MOE, shrinkage and creep. FA increased the density and reduced EMC and creep. MMF increased density and EMC but reduced creep, HT reduced EMC and creep. All four modification methods reduced the relative creep significantly. The creep factor was always lower for modified timber than for the controls. Untreated and modified timber have different material properties and deformation behaviour. Density is suitable for the estimation of creep deflection for untreated timber but not for modified timber, whereas the MOE is suitable for the estimation of creep deflection for both, untreated and modified timber. The use of modified timber as a building material is possible in non-load-bearing components such as wall cladding in wet rooms and garden furniture and in constructions for components, such as floor joists when serviceability limit state governs the design. However, the strength properties such as shear and tensile and design properties for mechanical connection must be determined in order to use modified timber in load-bearing structures...|$|R

Three types pretreatment were used to prepare the particle, namely : 1) water boiling for 30 and 60 minutes, 2) oxydation using hydrogen peroxyde, and 3) combination of water boiling for 30 minutes and oxydation using hydrogen proxide. As a control, conventional particleboards using 10 % <b>melamine</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> (MF) <b>resin</b> based on dry particle weight was produced. The particle which has pretreated then utilized to produce binderless particleboard with board density of 0. 75 g/cm 3. The pressing conditions were 180 oC in temperature, 25 kgf/cm 2 in pressure for 20 minutes. The board characteristics were tested according to JIS A 5908 2003. The results indicated that particleboard made from particle with oxydation pretreatment performed superior characteristics compared to those of particleboard made from particle only with water boiling pretreatment. Dimensional stability and modulus of elasticity of board with oxydation pretreatment were excellent. Its was superior compared to that of conventional particleboard using <b>melamine</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> as adhesive...|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} about the synthesis of polyurethane glue, which is capable of gluing together sawdust, and about the testing of the mechanical characteristics of the glue and sawdust compostion. This glue is biodegradable and is created from renewable resources, {{this is why it}} could be an appropriate replacement for phenol <b>formaldehyde,</b> <b>melamine,</b> and urea <b>formaldehyde</b> <b>resins.</b> Another indisputable advantage is the absence of arenes in the macromolecule structure, which can be carcinogenic. In this synthesis, the compounds polylactic acid and hexamethylene diisocyanate were chosen, the former as the polyol and the latter as the isocyanate. In the theoretical section of the thesis, the used compounds are described in terms of their characteristics, their creation and the tests of the composites as well. In the experimental section, the conducted experiments are described...|$|R
40|$|High {{pressure}} laminates (HPLs) are attractive, {{resistant to}} environmental effects and good cost-benefit decorative surface composite materials whose properties can {{be tailored to}} meet specific market demands. In this study, the substantial improvement of dirt repellence of HPLs with simultaneous enhancement of its abrasion resistance was achieved {{for the first time}} by incorporating nonafluorohexyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (FH-POSS) nanoparticles (up to 1 % w/w) into a <b>melamine</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> (MF) <b>resin</b> matrix used to impregnate decorative and overlay papers required for HPLs production. FH-POSS particles were synthesized and thoroughly characterized by C- 13 and Si- 29 solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Fluoroalkyl moieties in FH-POSS afforded increased hydrophobicity to HPLs thus providing improved surface clean ability, whereas abrasion resistance was improved due to the robust silica core of the POSS particles. Hydrophobicity of HPLs doped with FH-POSS increased with time, after resin curing, and this was attributed to migration of FH-POSS nanoparticles to the composite surface. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The {{long-term}} {{performance of}} a structural member is determined by its durability and deformation with time. The bending creep behaviour of modified wood was assessed experimentally {{over a period of}} 35 days (840 hours). Four chemical modification processes were used: 1, 3 -dimethylol- 4, 5 -dihydroxyethyleneurea (DMDHEU), mmethylated <b>melamine</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> <b>resin</b> (MMF), tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and amid wax (WA). Wood stakes with 20. 10. 200 mm RTL dimensions of Portuguese Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) from sapwood part of the stem were used for evaluated the primary creep. Experiments were conducted at bending stresses amounting to 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 4 of the mean immediate wood bending strength obtained at equilibrium moisture content (EMC). Applying the same stress level (SL, 0. 2), wood creep was also determined at the constant low and high moisture content. As results: Between low and medium SL (8 and 16 N/mm 2), unmodified wood at indoors conditions did not show any effect in the creep factors (kc). However, at high SL (35 N/mm 2) a slight increase (not significant) in the kc was found. It seems that the kc was nearly independent of the SL. In the lumen fill modification (TEOS and wax), the deposited material has not affected the creep behaviour under various SL. The cell wall modification (with DMDHEU and MMF resins) did not show any differences in the kc for low and medium SL (8 and 16 N/mm 2). However, resin modification under high SL (35 N/mm 2) has shown a significant reduction related to unmodified wood. Between both types of resin (DMDHEU and MMF) and levels of modification (WPG), significant effect was not found. At saturated conditions, lumen fill modification (TEOS and wax) did not show any effect on creep. In the cell wall modification (DMDHEU and MMF resin), significant reduction was recorded due to the embrittlement effect imparted by the modification (deposit of resin in the cell wall).
