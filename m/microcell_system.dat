This paper proposes a mobile location estimation based on the differences of downlink signal attenuations. This provides the possible mobile locations if the relationship between distances and signal attenuation is determined. Then, the mobile location can be estimated from those possible locations.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new interference model for microcellular networks which integrates radio propagation parameters and user terminal mobility. This model uses a parameter denoted the "interference to noise ratio" (INR) {{to obtain a}} simplified description of mobile link outage contours {{as a function of}} the location of the fixed and mobile radio ports. The INR is used to demonstrate that microcell networks are more interference limited than macrocell networks, and thus are more affected by user terminal mobility. Expressions are derived for the INR and user terminal cell radius distributions. It is shown that in <b>microcell</b> <b>systems</b> a significant proportion of terminals may not be able to meet a contiguous coverage criterion, and that closer microcell spacing can reduce rather than improve the coverage quality. Examination of cochannel and adjacent channel reuse ratios in DCA <b>microcell</b> <b>systems</b> suggest that the closer frequency reuse is primarily responsible for these coverage effects.

40|$|Indoor mobile {{communication}} systems {{are expected to}} provide significantly higher data rates and coverage than that offered by the conventional <b>microcell</b> <b>system.</b> However, the system performance is impaired by co-channel interference due {{to the need to}} reuse the limited available spectrum. To mitigate the effect of co-channel interference in this environment, distributed antenna systems (DASs) can be used to reduces the overall transmit power (and hence co-channel interference) by shortening the radio transmission distance between the transmitter and the receiver. In this paper, the impacts of DAS on uplink transmission in high-rise buildings is investigated, where remote antenna units (RAUs) are deployed on each floor throughout the building and connected to a central unit (CU) where received signals are processed. The performance of the system is analysed using a propagation channel model derived from multi-floor in-building path loss values retrieved from measurement data. For different system parameters, the average spectral efficiency is computed for a given maximum required BER, and parameters which yield the maximum spectral efficiency are identified. Numerical results obtained suggest that the proposed scheme can facilitate better use of the available radio spectrum, and provide higher data rates for indoor MTs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{performance}} of hybrid micro-diversity, {{in the form}} of generalized selection combining (GSC), and macrodiversity is presented for lognormal shadowed Rayleigh fading channels. The GSC-augmented macrodiversity consists of K ports in a cell site, each port carrying N microscopic diversity antennas. The macroscopic diversity involves selecting the port with the highest long-term local mean SNR among the K ports, and the GSC uses n strongest signals of the N branch received signals from that port for processing. We derive analytical expressions for error probability and outage for systems employing this hybrid scheme. The expressions are valid for any configurations of K, N, n. In <b>microcell</b> <b>systems</b> substantial correlation could exist among the ports in contrast to the zero correlation assumption of macrocell; results are also shown for correlated lognormal shadowed Rayleigh channels.

40|$|Abstract-A {{microcell}} interference model {{termed the}} Nakagami m,/m, is introduced in this paper. The desired signal {{as well as}} the cochannel interferers are assumed to have Nakagami statistics but with different amounts of fading. A special case of this model is obtained when the desired signal has Nakagami statistics while the cochannel interferers are subject to Rayleigh fading. The probability density function of the signal-to-interference ratio in the Nakagami m,/m, model is derived. This model is also compared with a Rician/Rayleigh microcellular model. The Nakagami m,/m, model is chosen to investigate the microcellular systems because Nakagami distributions fit experimental data better than either Rayleigh or Rician distributions in many cases. Expressions for the outage probabilities in <b>microcell</b> <b>systems</b> are derived. Numerical results show that, compared to medium/large cell systems, the microcellular systems have a lower outage probability. The impact of diversity on the microcellular system is also studied. Both signal-to-noise plus interference ratio selection diversity and signal-plus-interference selection diversity are investigated and an improvement to the outage probability due to diversity is observed.

Results showed that the compressive stimulations explored did not have a significant impact on chondrocyte viability and proliferation. However, the metabolic activity of chondrocytes was significantly affected by the stimulating frequency at the higher compressive strain of 40 % (2 [*]Hz, 40 % strain).

One major motivation to employ microcell/macrocell overlays {{is to increase the}} capacity without increasing the handoff rates. In this paper, a cellular system consisting of two tiers with microcell in the lower-tier and multiple levels of (macro) cells in the upper-tier, is considered to separately serve mobiles with different speeds. The dimension of the upper-tier cell is approximately derived based on the mean velocity of mobiles the cell intends to serve.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a new {{algorithm}} is presented for esti-mating mobile speed for handoff in hierarchical cellular systems. The proposed {{algorithm is}} based on normalized autocorrelation values of received signals to estimate mobile speed; it contains six steps. First, the instantaneous power of the received baseband signal is calculated to remove the frequency offset and data/speech information-bearing signals, while keeping the Doppler frequency information. Second, the calculated power signal is filtered using a low-pass linear phase finite impulse response filter to suppress interference and noise. Third, the filtered power signal is deci-mated to ease the computational burden, while the decimation factor is properly chosen to avoid frequency aliasing. Fourth, autocorrelation values of the decimated filtered power signals are calculated on shifting slot by slot to suppress the “slot burst frequency ” interference. Fifth, the calculated autocorrelation values are normalized to suppress the power fluctuation of the received signals. Finally, the normalized autocorrelation values are compared with thresholds to estimate mobile speed. The simulation {{results indicate that the}} new algorithm works very well for both nondispersive channels and dispersive channels to distinguish fast and slow moving mobiles. The method has very low latency, with results being available typically within 1 s after communication is established, and it can report estimation result every second or less. The algorithm has been implemented by software code into Nortel’s base-station radios and tested in Nortel’s wireless communications labs. The lab test results are very close to the computer simulation results, which have very good estimation accuracy.
