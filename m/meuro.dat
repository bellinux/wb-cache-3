Everything is prosperous in Saxony since that March on Hoyerswerda; Henri, with his Fincks and Wunsches, beautifully posted in the Meissen-Torgau region; no dislodging of him, let Daun, with his big mass of forces, try as he may. Daun, through the month of October, is in various Camps, in Schilda last of all: Henri {{successively}} in two; in Strehla for some ten days; then in Torgau for about three weeks, carefully intrenched, [Tempelhof. iii. 276, 281, 284 (Henri in Strehla, October 4th-17th; thence to Torgau: 22d October, Daun [...] "quits his Camp of Belgern" [...] for that of Schilda, which was his last in those parts).]--where traces of him will turn up (not too opportunely) next year.

One beautiful slap to Duke d'Ahremberg (a poor old friend of Daun's and ours) we will remember: [...] "Action of Pretsch" [...] they call it; defeat, almost capture of poor D'Ahremberg; who had been sent to dislodge the Prince, by threatening his supplies, and had wheeled, accordingly, eastward, wide away; but, to his astonishment, found, after a march or two, Three select Prussian Corps emerging on him, by front, by rear, by flank, with Horse-artillery (quasi-miraculous) bursting out on hill-tops, too,--and, in short, nothing for it but to retreat, or indeed to run, in a considerably ruinous style: poor D'Ahremberg!

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Chronic HCV is {{a leading}} cause of {{hospitalization}} and death in populations coinfected with HIV in Italy. Sofosbuvir (SOF) is a pan-genotypic drug, which can be used alone or combined with other agents (e. g. Simeprevir,Daclatasvir, Ledipasvir) as oral treatment for HCV, with different price levels. We performed a 5 year-horizon budget impact analysis of SOF-based regimens for the management of HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. METHODS: This prospective study involved 4 Italian Infectious Diseases Departments in the Liguria Region. A total of 1. 005 coinfected patients (30 % cirrhotics) in any stage of their hepatic disease stages was considered (F 0 -F 4, cirrhosis,transplanted,, HCC). Disease stage costs per patient were collected, taking into account the rate of expected disease progression in absence of treatment and the rate of Sustained Virological Response (SVR) with SOF-based regimens. The success rate for SOF-based Regimens was estimated based on literature data and expert opinion. Drugs prices used in the calculation were those paid by the Italian Health Service. Two scenarios were compared: ”no treatment” versus b) SOF-based treatment. Data were analyzed from the Regional Health Service standpoint. RESULTS: Over the next 5 years, the total expense in a “no treatment” scenario (base case) should approximate 54 M Euros,, with 89 deaths. Assuming an SVR success rate of 90 %, average SOF-based regimens price higher than € 50. 000 costs more than € 55 millions, resulting not convenient. At the average price of 15. 000 € per patient, the total expense in the SOF-based scenario should approach 20 <b>MEuros,</b> i. e. more than 60 % lower than in the “no-treatment” scenario. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that at the average price of € 15. 000 per patient over the next 5 years, the use of SOF should allow saving half of the economic resources needed to manage the HIV/HCV disease population...|$|R

The Church was formerly a Catholic place of worship under the name St. Catherines taken from Catherine of Sienna. Close on five hundred and fifty years ago Bothwell and Shotts formed one Parish which stretched from the Clyde to Linlithgowshire, and from the North to the South Calder. In this large area there were four places of worship, one of which was situated in the middle Bothwellmuir at [...] "a desert place called Bertram-Shotts". Bertram was reputed to be a Giant who lived in the area and terrorised travellers on the Glasgow/Edinburgh road. A reward was offered for his capture - dead or alive - and was claimed by William Muirhead who lay in wait for Bertram when the latter came to his favourite drinking place - a spring of water on the hillside above Shottsburn. He hamstrung him and, as the giant lay laughing up at him, he cut off his head with the words, [...] "Will ye laugh-up yet?" [...] It was on Bertram's plot of land that St. Catherine’s Chapel was built in 1450. It was dedicated to [...] "the blessed Virgin and Catherine of Sienna".After the Reformation of 1560, Kirk o’Shotts otherwise known as Shottskirk or the affectionately titled [...] "M8 Church" [...] became a Protestant place of worship.

Besides its interpretative sterility, this opposition is only apparent when it comes to policy making since, by definition, no true bottom-up policy ever could be “designed” ex ante. Here we take seriously Tendler’s (1982) suggestion to tackle development issue from an organizational standpoint and, consistently, we consider local development as a heuristic, boundly rational (Simon, 1947), collective process of actions and decisions. In particular, we equate local development to organizational change, i. e. a change in the common end, in the knowledge and competencies, in the rules of coordination and control (Thompson, 1967) that occurs in a geographical area or in one of its portions or layers. This theoretical framework informed a two-year action-research conducted in a southern Italian region in which the authors - as a team of the Italian Ministry of Economic Development - Department for development policies - gave methodological support to the design and implementation of 5 <b>Meuro</b> investment on the regional artistic and creative scene.

In Austria the driving element for setting-up a large-scale cooperative services field test has been the newly emerging opportunity to directly communicate with car drivers in contexts when public transport offers an attractive alternative (thus reducing CO 2 emission). Rather soon – while setting-up the field test – it became clear that cooperative services (EASYWAY set) have not only a significant potential in terms of increasing efficiency but also in terms of effectively coping with severe weather conditions.

40|$|We analyze {{options to}} reduce the future {{environmental}} impact of dairy cattle production, using an optimization model (DAIRY) applied to the Czech Republic. The DAIRY model {{can be used to}} calculate the overall environmental impact (OEI). We show that aquatic eutrophication and global warming are the 2 most important problems caused by dairy cattle. These problems are largely caused by nitrate leaching and emissions from animal housing. The DAIRY model indicates that the costs of reducing the OEI in 2020 by 20 % are 12 <b>MEuro.</b> It is most cost effective to achieve this reduction by improving the efficiency of animal manure used as fertilizer. We tested the sensitivity of the model to assumptions about the following: 1) the relative importance of environmental problems as expressed in weighting factors, and 2) future cattle numbers and milk yield per milking cow. The first case indicates that disagreement on which problem is most urgent need not lead to disagreement about policies to be undertaken. Regardless of the weighting factors used, aquatic eutrophication and global warming are the most important problems. However, the overall costs of reducing the OEI differ with alternative sets of weighting factors, because the costs of emission reduction differ among pollutants. The second case shows that the DAIRY model results are more sensitive to changes in cattle numbers than to changes in milk yield. This study is the first integrated assessment of dairy cattle production for a Central European country and illustrates how systematic analyses may help to find optimal solution...|$|E

40|$|Agricultural {{activities}} strongly affect {{landscapes and}} also cause {{a variety of}} environmental and health problems in many European countries. Environmental policies to minimise this negative impacts of agriculture differ between countries. This thesis focuses on environmental consequences of agricultural activities in the Czech Republic and possibilities to reduce the associated environmental problems. The causes and solutions of these air, water and soil pollution problems are complex, and designing sustainable farming systems requires integration of social, economic, and natural sciences. The agriculture practices in the Czech Republic have changed dramatically due to political changes during last decade. These changes ameliorate environmental problems to some extent through {{a reduction in the}} use of fertilizers and livestock numbers. However, agriculture still poses a threat to the environment and human health. The agricultural productivity may intensify in the future leading to increased pollution. Now the Czech Republic {{is a member of the}} European Union, Czech farmers have to deal with many new regulations set by European Commission aiming at reducing environmental problems. The overall objective of this thesis is to assess the future environmental impact by the agricultural sector in the Czech Republic. National and European environmental policies and the interaction between human activities and environmental trends have been considered. The novel aspect of this thesis is to include process-based emission factors in a region specific model to quantify both emissions and their potential environmental and health impacts. Additionally, these results are used in another purposely developed model to assess the reduction costs involved. To achieve the overall objective three specific research aims are defined. The first aim is to analyse different emission estimation methods with respect to their usefulness for an integrated assessment at the national scale. The second is to evaluate the potential environmental impact of agricultural emissions at the sub-national level while considering different agricultural practices and environmental characteristics. The third aim is to integrate emission estimation methods and impact assessment approaches in a model to assess the cost-effectiveness of environmental policy measures. This model is applied in a case study focusing on dairy cattle as one of the most polluting sub-sectors of Czech agriculture. It is used to analyse the current situation and to explore future trends up to 2020 as affected by (i) different views of hypothetical model users on importance of environmental impact, (ii) changes in projected animal numbers and management and (iii) changes in the application of emission reduction measures. Integrated assessments that analyse environmental problems by agriculture simultaneously, need complete, detailed and consistent emission estimates that consider possible interrelations between different pollutants. Three types of emission estimation methods were analysed: emission factor, regression analyses and process-based methods. Selected examples of emission estimation methods were reviewed to illustrate the large variety in methods available. These methods were evaluated based on three steps: (1) Comparison of emission estimation methods with respect to specific characteristics, (2) Scoring of methods based on quality and country-specific criteria and the extent to which interrelations between pollutants are accounted for, and (3) Multi-Criteria Analysis taking into account the relative importance of the different criteria. The usefulness of this approach was demonstrated by applying it to a case study focusing on agriculture in the Czech Republic. The evaluation of emission estimation methods reveals large differences. We conclude that the following methods best meet our criteria: the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, methods from the INITIATOR model and the detailed method of the EMEP/CORINAIR Guidebook. Based on this analysis we suggest that combining parts of each of the four methods forms a sound basis for a new emission estimation method for quantifying agricultural emissions of air, water and soil pollution simultaneously. The potential environmental and health impact of selected agricultural emissions was evaluated based on a new innovative approach. Emission estimates were combined with a country-specific set of indicators to assess the environmental impact of dairy cattle in nine regions defined according to specific environmental characteristics. In this thesis different characterisation factors available in the literature were compared and evaluated with respect to usefulness for a study focusing on dairy cattle in the Czech Republic. We conclude that for our case the most appropriate set of characterisation factors are those from Sepällä et al. (2006) and EDIP (2003). These factors are based on the most recent data and best available scientific models and take into account, where possible national and regional differences. However, a weakness of these combinations may be potential internal inconsistencies We estimate the contribution of emissions of ammonia (NH 3) nitrogen oxides (NOx), nitrate (NO- 3), phosphate (PO 4 - 3), particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2. 5), methane (CH 4), and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) to a number of environmental and health problems. The results show large regional differences in the current environmental and health impact per unit of agricultural production in the Czech Republic. The regional acidifying, eutrophying and global warming impact of dairy cattle is calculated to be up to three times the national average, depending on the dairy cattle intensity. Aquatic eutrophication is found to be a problem in regions with relatively high eutrophying emissions per hectare of so-called nitrate vulnerable zones. Human toxicity problems caused by dairy cattle livestock and manure management are problematic in regions with a high population density in rural areas. A linear optimisation model (DAIRY) including Multi-Criteria Analysis was developed to analyse cost-effectiveness of policy measures to reduce the environmental impact of dairy cattle in the Czech Republic. The DAIRY model combines process-based and emission factor approaches to calculate the above-mentioned emissions, and site-dependent characterisation factors to assess their contribution to acidification, terrestrial and aquatic eutrophication, global warming and human toxicity. In addition, a so-called overall environmental impact (OEI) indicator was used to assess the environmental performance of dairy cattle. The DAIRY model was used to analyse the current situation and to explore future trends up to 2020, under different environmental and cost constraints. The analysis of past and future trends of environmental and health impact by dairy cattle reveals decreasing trends over time, mainly as a result of reduced cattle numbers. In 2005 the OEI was considerably lower than in 1990. In the No Control scenario, which assumes no emission control, the 2020 environmental impact is 9 % lower than in 2005, mainly as a result of continued reduction in cattle numbers. Technical measures aimed at reducing ammonia emissions may reduce the 2020 uncontrolled OEI levels by 10 %. Implementation of all technical measures considered would reduce the 2020 OEI levels by 30 % at the national level. In optimised scenarios, the reductions in OEI in 2020 range from 1 % to 30 % relative to the No Control scenario, while the costs to achieve this reduction range between 0. 2 and 16 <b>MEuro.</b> We show that targets for OEI close to maximum feasible reduction can be realized at about one-third of the costs of non-optimised scenarios. In such cost-effective scenarios the model tends to select measures to reduce aquatic eutrophication and climate change first, which is in contrast to current policies aiming at acidification and terrestrial eutrophication. Cost-optimal solutions at the national level are not always the cheapest solutions at the regional level. The future environmental impact of dairy cattle in the Czech Republic was analysed for two reference scenarios. The No Control scenario assumes no emission control while the Policy Scenario aims at cost-effective reduction of the OEI by 20 % relative to No Control scenario. Next, we explored how these calculated trends change as result of different assumption on (i) different views of hypothetical model users on importance of environmental impact, (ii) changes in projected animal numbers and management and (iii) changes in the application of emission reduction measures. The reference scenarios indicate that the overall environmental impact by dairy cattle is mainly associated with global warming and aquatic eutrophication while leaching and housing are the two most contributing processes. The costs to reduce OEI by 20 % are 12 <b>MEuro.</b> The most cost-effective combination of measures to achieve this target includes manure efficiency improvement and improved timing of manure application. The results suggest that regardless of model users views on the relative importance of different environmental problems, global warming and aquatic eutrophication are most important. However, the relative shares of these two in OEI depend on the valuation of the environmental impact categories. This, in turn, has an impact on the costs of reducing OEI, because it is cheaper to reduce emissions of nitrate than emissions of greenhouse gases. As a result costs to reduce 20 % OEI range from 7 to 26 <b>MEuro</b> for different sets of valuation factors. The model result also suggests that dairy cattle kept in slurry-based systems have a better environmental performance than dairy cattle kept in straw-based systems. In addition, cattle numbers influence the OEI and the reduction costs more than changes in milk yield. The costs of reducing OEI by 20 % relative to uncontrolled level range between 2 and 16 <b>MEuro</b> for scenarios with different assumptions on animal numbers and manure management. Taking into account unintended side-effects of reduction measures on the environment as a criterion for selection of measures, increases the reduction costs considerably. The changes in applicability of emission reduction measures lead to costs ranging between 24 and 50 <b>MEuro.</b> The research approach taken in this thesis is based on a unique combination of methods to estimate emissions, their potential environmental impact and possible solutions. These serve as essential building blocks of the DAIRY model. A major strength of the DAIRY model is that it allows for comprehensive analyses at the sector level and for identification of cost-effective ways to reduce the overall environmental impact of dairy cattle. As such, it can serve as example for other countries and sectors...|$|E
40|$|ADAHELI (ADvanced Astronomy for HELIophysics) is a small-class (500 kg) low-budget (50 <b>MEuro)</b> {{satellite}} {{mission for}} the study of the solar photosphere and the chromosphere and for monitoring solar flare emission. ADAHELI’s design has completed its Phase-A feasibility study in December 2008, in the framework of ASI’s (Agenzia Spaziale Italiana) 2007 “Small Missions” Program (calling for two missions at 50 MEeuros each, plus the launch budget). ADAHELI’s main purpose is to explore Sun’s lower atmosphere in the near-infrared, a region so far unexplored by solar observations from space. ADAHELI will carry out observations of the solar photosphere and of the chromosphere at high-temporal rate and high spatial and spectral resolutions. ADAHELI will contribute to the understanding of Space Weather through the study of particle acceleration during flares. A radiometer operating in the millimeter radio band will continuously monitor the solar disk, throughout the spacecraft’s life time. ADAHELI’s baseline instruments are a 50 -cm high–resolution telescope operating in the visible and the near-infrared, and a lightweight full-disk radiometer operating at millimeter wavelengths (90 GHz). The core of the telescope’s focal plane suite is the spectral imager based on two Fabry-Perot interferometers, flying for the first time on a solar mission. The instrument will return fast-cadence, full bi-dimensional spectral images at high-resolution, thus improving on current slit-scan, mono-dimensional architectures. Moreover, the possibility of working in polarized light will enable full 3 D magnetic field reconstruction on the photosphere and the chromosphere. An optional instrumental package is also being proposed to further extend ADAHELI’s scope: a full-disk telescope for helioseismology based on a double Magneto-Optical Filter, a Neutral Particle Analyzer for magnetospheric research, an Extreme Ultraviolet imaging and spectro-radiometry instrument. These options fall outside the prescribed budget. ADAHELI, flying a Sun-Synchronous orbit at 800 km, will perform continuous, long-duration (4 -h), daily acquisitions, with the possibility of extending them up to 24 h. ADAHELI’s operating life is two years, plus one extension year. Launch would be nominally planned for 2014...|$|E
40|$|The Small Mars Satellite (SMS) is a {{low-cost}} mission to Mars, currently under feasibility study {{funded by the}} European Space Agency (ESA). The mission, whose estimated cost is within 120 <b>MEuro,</b> aims at delivering a small Lander to Mars using an innovative deployable (umbrella-like) heat shield concept, known as IRENE (Italian ReEntry NacellE), developed and patented by ALI S. c. a. r. l., {{which is also the}} project's prime contractor. The Lander includes two small payloads, i. e., a dust particle analyzer and an aerial drone. The former is based on an instrument, developed by the Astronomical Observatory of Capodimonte (INAF-OAC), performing in-situ measurements of the size distribution and abundance of dust particles suspended in the Martian atmosphere. The drone is being designed by the University of Naples and aims at demonstrating the feasibility of low-altitude flight in the Martian atmosphere. The project also involves the Space Studies Institute of Catalonia (IEEC), responsible for launch and trajectory design. In the paper, we illustrate the results of the feasibility study of SMS, including a description of the mission profile, launch and escape phases, interplanetary trajectory, Mars approach, entry, descent and landing (EDL), and payload deployment and operations. The current baseline envisages launching to LEO with VEGA. Then, a dedicated propulsion module will provide a series of apogee raising maneuvers to place the vehicle on the hyperbolic trajectory to Mars. A targeting maneuver, provided by a cruise stage, will direct the spacecraft to the atmospheric entry point providing initial conditions suitable for the deployment of the heat shield. This will provide a ballistic coefficient much lower than in previous Mars missions, thus allowing to reach subsonic conditions without the use of a supersonic parachute. To demonstrate this, EDL and aero-thermo-dynamic analyses are performed with a 3 -DoF model of the entry trajectory and high fidelity CFD and DSMC analysis tools. Finally, particular attention is devoted to the description of the deployable shield technology and verification...|$|E
40|$|Wc {{present a}} {{feasibility}} study for an Active Debris Removal (ADR) mission called Agora (Active Grabbing & Orbital Removal of Ariane), aimed at removing discarded Ariane rocket bodies (R/Bs). The Agora mission {{goal is to}} demonstrate technologies to autonomously remove an Ariane R/B in a controlled manner, using an active dctumbling device and a robotic grabbing mechanism, within a cost cap of 200 <b>MEuro</b> FY 2015, by 2025. R/Bs belong to a growing class of space debris objects that pose a sizable risk to operational satellites. The threat of on-orbit collisions must be addressed within the near-future {{to ensure that the}} risk of catastrophic events, like the Iridium-Cosmos collision in 2009 (Kelso, 2009; Tan et al., 2013). is mitigated. Liou ct al. (2010) indicate that at least five large objects will need to be removed per year, over the next 200 years, from the Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) region, to stabilize the current debris population. This necessitates development and demonstration of key Active Debris Removal (ADR) technologies, including robust Guidance, Navigation Control (GNC) for autonomous close-proximity operations. We detail the payload systems incorporated on the chaser spacecraft to rendezvous, detumble, grab, and de-orbit an Ariane 5 R/B. The de-Tumbling payload will aim to reduce the tumbling rate of the R/B to enable safe attachment of a de-orbiting kit. The de-Tumbling phase is a dissipative process based on Joule's Law: eddy currents arc generated on the target due to an enhanced magnetic field, generated actively by an on-board electromagnetic coil (Ortiz &: Walker, 2015). The robotic payload will ensure (scmi-) autonomous capture of the R/B and deployment of a de-orbiting kit, while compensating for dynamic coupling between the chaser and the robotic manipulator that will arise during actuation of the latter (Jankovic, ct al., 2015). Wc present an analysis of a semi-rigid clamping mechanism, based on an anthropomorphic robotic finger design, for the capture of the target, and a manipulator, for deploying the de-orbiting kit. The framework for Agora complements the European technology roadmap for ADR, and is aligned with missions such as c. Dcorbit (European Space Agency) and DEOS (German Aerospace Center) ...|$|E
