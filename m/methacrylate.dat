40|$|Background: There {{are very}} few reports of {{airborne}} allergic contact dermatitis from <b>methacrylates.</b> Objectives: To report a dental nurse with facial eczema supposedly caused by airborne <b>methacrylates</b> present in the work environment. Methods: Patch testing with serial dilutions of several <b>methacrylates</b> and work provocations in environments containing <b>methacrylates</b> was performed. Results: Patch testing with serial dilutions of several <b>methacrylates</b> disclosed a high patch test reactivity.

40|$|Abstract: The NMR {{chemical}} shift, i. e., the π-electron {{density of}} the double bond, of acrylates and <b>methacrylates</b> {{is related to the}} reactivity of their monomers. We investigated quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPRs) between the base-catalyzed hydrolysis rate constants (k 1) or the rate constant with glutathione (GSH) (log kGSH) for acrylates and <b>methacrylates</b> and the 13 C NMR chemical shifts of their α,β-unsaturated carbonyl groups (δCα and δCβ) or heat of formation (Hf) calculated by the semi-empirical MO method. Reported data for the independent variables were employed. A significant linear relationship between k 1 and δCβ, but not δCα, was obtained for <b>methacrylates</b> (r 2 = 0. 93), but not for acrylates. Also, a significant relationship between k 1 and Hf was obtained for both acrylates and <b>methacrylates</b> (r 2 = 0. 89). By contrast, log kGSH for acrylates and <b>methacrylates</b> was linearly related to their δCβ (r 2 = 0. 99), but not to Hf. These findings indicate that the 13 C NMR chemical shifts and calculated Hf values for acrylates and <b>methacrylates</b> could be valuable for estimating the hydrolysis rate constants and GSH reactivity of these compounds. Also, these data for monomers may be an important tool for examining mechanisms of reactivity...|$|R

40|$|Radical {{polymerization}} of alkyl <b>methacrylates</b> {{initiated by}} AIBN is controlled when {{conducted in the}} presence of a mixture of NO/NO 2. Reaction of alkyl <b>methacrylates</b> with NO/NO 2 leads indeed to the monomer adduct and parent α-nitro, ω-nitroso oligomers, which are precursors of nitroxides, known to control the radical polymerization of alkyl <b>methacrylates,</b> according to a "Nitroxide-Mediated Polymerization" (NMP) mechanism. Although some side reactions may occur with time (increasing polydispersity), polymerization of MMA initiated by AIBN at low temperature (60 °C) after bubbling of NO/NO 2 is relatively fast, and the molecular weight is dictated by the amount of NO/NO 2. Finally, for the first time, copolymerization of MMA with HEMA (10 / 1; v/v) has been controlled by this mixture of NO and NO 2 although the reaction remains very fast (ca. 65 % monomer conversion after 5 h at 60 °C), which is of prime importance for coating applications...|$|R

30|$|The {{self-adhesive}} {{resin cement}} {{used in this}} study showed similar values of bond strength to other adhesive protocols. Manufacturers have marketed self-adhesive resin cements to simplify the clinical procedures and overcome the technique sensitivity of multiple-step systems. According to manufacturers, these resin-based materials do not require any pretreatment of the dental surfaces and their main adhesive mechanism is attributed to a chemical reaction between phosphate <b>methacrylates</b> and hydroxyapatite [8, 20 – 22]. However, the formation of a thick and dense smear layer during the root canal instrumentation [23] impairs a proper contact between the acidic <b>methacrylates</b> of self-adhesive cements and the underlying dentin, compromising the bond strength [24, 25].|$|R
25|$|Antimicrobial {{activity}} can be imparted onto a surface through the grafting of functionalized polymers, for example those terminated with quaternary amine functional groups, {{through one of}} two principle methods. With these methods—“grafting to” and “grafting from”—polymers can be chemically bound to a solid surface and thus {{the properties of the}} surface (i.e. antimicrobial activity) can be controlled. Quaternary ammonium ion-containing polymers (PQA) have been proven to effectively kill cells and spores through their interactions will cell membranes. A wealth of nitrogenous monomers can be quaternized to be biologically active. These monomers, for example 2-dimethylaminoethyl <b>methacrylate</b> (DMAEMA) or 4-vinyl pyridine (4-VP) can be subsequently polymerized with ATRP.

25|$|Polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogels are {{biocompatible}} and {{proven to}} be tolerated in many tissue types, including the CNS. Mahoney and Anseth formed PEG hydrogels by photopolymerizing <b>methacrylate</b> groups covalently linked to degradable PEG macromers. Hydrogel degradation was monitored over time by measuring mechanical strength (compressive modulus) and average mesh size from swelling ratio data. Initially, the polymer chains were highly cross-linked, but as degradation proceeded, ester bonds were hydrolyzed, allowing the gel to swell; the compressive modulus decreased as the mesh size increased until the hydrogel was completely dissolved. It was demonstrated that neural precursor cells were able to be photoencapsulated and cultured on the PEG gels with minimal cell death. Because the mesh size is initially small, the hydrogel blocks inflammatory and other inhibitory signals from surrounding tissue. As the mesh size increases, the hydrogel is able {{to serve as a}} scaffold for axon regeneration.|$|E

A 3D MOF { • 4DMF • H2O} (bpdc: biphenyldicarboxylate, bpy: 4,4′-bipyridine) was synthesized by Li and coworkers. Using this MOF photochemistry of o-methyl dibenzyl ketone (o-MeDBK) was extensively studied. This molecule was found to have a variety of photochemical reaction properties including the production of cyclopentanol. MOFs have been used to study polymerization in the confined space of MOF channels. Polymerization reactions in confined space might have different properties than polymerization in open space. Styrene, divinylbenzene, substituted acetylenes, methyl <b>methacrylate,</b> and vinyl acetate have all been studied by Kitagawa and coworkers as possible activated monomers for radical polymerization. Due to the different linker size the MOF channel size could be tunable on the order of roughly 25 and 100 Å2. The channels were shown to stabilize propagating radicals and suppress termination reactions when used as radical polymerization sites.|$|E

40|$|Many diverse {{applications}} utilize hydrogels as carriers, sensors, and actuators, {{and these}} applications {{rely on the}} refined control of physical properties of the hydrogel, such as elastic modulus and degree of swelling. Often, hydrogel properties are interdependent; for example, when elastic modulus is increased, degree of swelling is decreased. Controlling these inverse dependencies remains a major barrier for broader hydrogel applications. We hypothesized that polymer cross-linkers with varied chain flexibility {{would allow us to}} tune the inverse dependency between the elastic modulus and the degree of swelling of the hydrogels. We examined this hypothesis by using alginate and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) modified with a controlled number of methacrylic groups as model inflexible and flexible cross-linkers, respectively. Interestingly, the polyacrylamide hydrogel crosslinked by the inflexible alginate <b>methacrylates</b> exhibited less dependency between the degree of swelling and the elastic modulus than the hydrogel cross-linked by flexible PAA <b>methacrylates.</b> This critical role of the cross-linker's inflexibility was related to the difference of the degree of hydrophobic association between polymer cross-linkers, as confirmed with pyrene probes added in pregel solutions. Furthermore, hydrogels cross-linked with alginate <b>methacrylates</b> could tune the projection area of adhered cells by solely altering elastic moduli. In contrast, gels cross-linked with PAA <b>methacrylates</b> failed to modulate the cellular adhesion morphology due to a lower, and smaller, elastic modulus range to be controlled. Overall, {{the results of this study}} will significantly advance the controllability of hydrogel properties and greatly enhance the performance of hydrogels in various biological applications. close 3...|$|R

25|$|In {{as early}} as the 1870s “{{polymers}}” formed by this process were known, but these polymers were initially thought of as undesirable byproducts associated with electric discharge, with little attention being given to their properties. It was not until the 1960s that the properties of these polymers where found to be useful. It was found that flawless thin polymeric coatings could be formed on metals, although for very thin films (<10mm) this has recently been shown to be an oversimplification. By selecting the monomer type and the energy density per monomer, known as the Yasuda parameter, the chemical composition and structure of the resulting thin film can be varied with a wide range. These films are usually inert, adhesive, and have low dielectric constants. Some common monomers polymerized by this method include styrene, ethylene, <b>methacrylate</b> and pyridine, just to name a few. The 1970s brought about many advances in plasma polymerization, including the polymerization of many different types of monomers.
