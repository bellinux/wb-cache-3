50|$|Harris had {{a series}} of private owner wagons built by the Gloucester Railway Carriage and Wagon Company, which {{considerably}} reduced transport costs. In later years, British Railways Class 37 locomotives rostered from Cardiff Canton and Barry depots, were placed in charge of coal hoppers on a <b>Merry-go-round</b> <b>train,</b> to transport coal to Aberthaw power station.|$|E
50|$|DB Cargo UK run coal trains between mining {{sites in}} South Wales, Nottinghamshire, South Yorkshire and Scotland and {{coal-fired}} power stations around Britain. These are run using <b>merry-go-round</b> <b>trains.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Knottingley TMD is a Traction Maintenance Depot {{located in}} Knottingley, West Yorkshire, England. The depot is {{situated}} on the Pontefract Line and is near Knottingley station. It opened in 1967 to maintain the locomotives and hopper wagons for a planned 75 <b>Merry-go-round</b> <b>trains</b> a day, expected to use the Wakefield and Goole line.|$|R
50|$|Mineral wagons were {{phased out}} by BR in the 1970s, {{following}} reduction {{in demand for}} household coal {{and the development of}} <b>merry-go-round</b> <b>trains,</b> which used much larger (and braked) hopper wagons. Two batches of 16T wagons were bought by CC Crump in 1971, hired to ICI in Runcorn for the transport of soda ash, and subsequently scrapped in 1979.|$|R
50|$|West Burton Power Station {{was used}} as a testing ground for the <b>merry-go-round</b> <b>train</b> system in 1965 which would be {{introduced}} at all 500 MW and above power stations. During the stations' early life in the 1970s and under the <b>merry-go-round</b> <b>train</b> agreement with British Rail and the National Coal Board, no deliveries were made at the weekends. The coal store has capacity for over three months' operation of the station. When discharged from the railway wagons, the coal drops into the hoppers immediately under the track, where it is scooped out evenly {{along the length of the}} hoppers by remotely operated paddle feeder machines. These deposit the coal on two twin deep-trough belt conveyors 1371.6 mm (54 in) wide, each with a capacity of 1,361 t/h (1,500 tons per hour) at 137.16 m/min (450 ft/min). The belt conveyors feed coal via the screening and crushing plant, where it is also passed through magnetic separators, to the transfer tower.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>merry-go-round</b> <b>train,</b> often {{abbreviated}} to MGR, is a block train of hopper wagons which both loads and unloads its cargo while moving. In the United Kingdom, {{they are most}} commonly coal trains delivering to power stations. These trains were introduced in the 1960s, and {{were one of the}} few innovations of the Beeching axe, along with investment from the CEGB (Central Electricity Generating Board) and the NCB (National Coal Board) into new power stations and loading facilities.|$|E
5000|$|All onsite {{shunting}} {{and movement}} between pit {{head and the}} coal washing plant was undertaken by privately owned shunters, the traffic for which greatly increased after the consolidation of coal extraction of the three pits to Bickershaw. Once washed, loaded coal wagons were the marshalled onwards to the exchange sidings with British Railways at [...] Latterly part of the <b>Merry-go-round</b> <b>train</b> system, the trains were most often hauled {{by a pair of}} British Rail Class 20 diesel locomotives, en route to Fiddlers Ferry Power Station.|$|E
50|$|Associated with <b>merry-go-round</b> <b>trains</b> are the {{construction}} of balloon loops at the origin and destination so that the train doesn't waste time shunting the engine {{from one end of}} the train to the other. However, whilst power stations such as Ratcliffe, West Burton and Cottam had balloon loops, few if any colliery/loading points had them and thus true merry-go-round operation never really existed.|$|R
5000|$|Knottingley TMD is {{just south}} of the station, on the Askern Line. It opened in 1967 to {{maintain}} the locomotives and hopper wagons for planned 75 <b>Merry-go-round</b> <b>trains</b> a day, expected to use the Wakefield and Goole line. [...] Though much of the coal traffic has now ceased, the depot is still used by the freight locos utilised on biomass trains to/from Drax power station ...|$|R
5|$|The main {{transport}} {{route to the}} power station for fuel (originally coal) is train via a -long freight-only section of the former Hull and Barnsley Railway, from the Pontefract Line at Hensall Junction. A balloon loop rail layout is used so that wagons of coal {{do not need to}} be shunted after being unloaded. <b>Merry-go-round</b> <b>trains</b> are used, so that wagons can be unloaded without the train stopping as it passes through an unloading house. On average, there are 35 deliveries a day, 6 days a week.|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} of an ore terminal {{as part of the}} Anchor project was authorised; use of local or regionally imported ores ceased or was greatly reduced, as a consequence of increased importation of foreign ores of far greater iron content. The Port of Immingham became {{a key part of the}} overall infrastructure of the Scunthorpe steelworks as an importation point. The Immingham Bulk Terminal was constructed [...] as a joint venture between BSC and the National Coal Board (NCB). Ore was to be supplied to the steelworks by a <b>Merry-go-round</b> <b>train</b> system. At the Normanby Park site ore was supplied from the stockyards built for the Appleby-Frodingham Anchor project by a conveyor.|$|E
50|$|In British Rail use, the sub-class were {{particularly}} common in South Wales on heavy coal and metals work. They {{were particularly}} adept at working coal trains {{up and down}} the short but steeply graded branch lines around Swansea and Cardiff to collieries such as Tower, Coed Bach and Cwm Bargoed. They operated <b>merry-go-round</b> <b>trains</b> of 32 ton HAA air-braked hoppers, usually numbering between 20 and 30 wagons, between collieries, washeries, open cast mines and disposal points to power stations such as Aberthaw and occasionally further afield.|$|R

50|$|Teesside had {{a number}} of {{marshalling}} yards servicing the coal mines and steel mills of Consett, West County Durham and North Yorkshire, as well as those for Middlesbrough Dock. The decision was hence taken to rationalise these to one yard, and in 1957 to the immediate west of Erimus, BR developed the new Tees Marshalling Yard and associated Thornaby TMD. Initially developed as a hump shunting facility, by the time construction was completed in 1963 wagon-shunting had been replaced by Containerisation and <b>Merry-go-round</b> <b>trains,</b> and hence hump shunting ceased.|$|R
50|$|The main {{transport}} {{route to the}} power station for fuel (originally coal) is train via a 7.2 km-long freight-only section of the former Hull and Barnsley Railway, from the Pontefract Line at Hensall Junction. A balloon loop rail layout is used so that wagons of coal {{do not need to}} be shunted after being unloaded. <b>Merry-go-round</b> <b>trains</b> are used, so that wagons can be unloaded without the train stopping as it passes through an unloading house. On average, there are 35 deliveries a day, 6 days a week.|$|R
50|$|Coal {{supply was}} by rail {{transport}} (initially 4m. tons {{a year in}} 1,000-ton <b>Merry-go-round</b> <b>trains</b> {{at the rate of}} 17 a day) and road transport and barge (initially 1m. tons on the Aire and Calder Navigation). Barge transport ended in the late 1990s. The automatic unloading equipment for the coal trains was built by Rhymney Engineering, a Powell Duffryn company. It used ultrasonic detection, capable of dealing with up to 99 wagons in a train (though initially trains had 35 hopper wagons), to control the door-opening gear to empty 5 wagons at a time into the bunkers.|$|R
50|$|By the 1970s, {{the energy}} {{requirements}} of Britain's households and industry had changed. The Clean Air Act and North Sea gas {{meant that the}} number of domestic users of coal was dwindling, industry was now powered by electricity, and the centralisation of the power industry under the Central Electricity Generating Board meant that power was generated in a new fleet of large power stations rather small municipal generators. The remaining coal traffic was block-train rather than wagon-load and consequently did not require much marshalling: the coming of <b>Merry-go-round</b> <b>trains</b> for coal that travelled from colliery or dock to power station in a continuous cycle further reduced this need.|$|R
5000|$|Changes {{in demand}} also {{influenced}} {{the flow of}} coal. By the 1960s household coal was in decline and power station coal was on the rise. In 1959, for example, High Marnham Power Station opened and immediately created a new demand in a new location. This was followed in the 1960s by larger new power stations in the Trent Valley whose demand for coal necessitated new technology, which was provided in notable forms such as [...] "TOPS" [...] and computer timetabled <b>Merry-go-round</b> <b>trains</b> (mgr). West Burton Power Station's power signalbox was opened in 1965, in preparation for stockpiling coal on a wholly different scale from traditional working.|$|R
5000|$|West of {{the station}} is Foxhall Junction which allows freight trains from Oxford to travel towards Swindon. Immediately beyond this two goods lines diverge {{on the north side}} of the line. The first served a loop for <b>Merry-go-round</b> <b>trains</b> that used to deliver coal to Didcot Power Station. The second serves the Milton Freight Terminal, though this line is not in regular use (NIRU). [...] Beyond this the four main and relief lines merge into three at Foxhall Junction and after a small loop just before Steventon, the four lines pass under the A34 and become two lines as far as the old station at Wantage Road.|$|R
5000|$|The 4.5 mi {{single track}} branch opened in 1960 in {{preparation}} for the opening of the colliery in 1963. It left the LD&ECR about a kilometre west of Boughton and turned north. Half the line was in cutting, half on a bank, with a 350 yd tunnel (built to preserve agricultural land), bridges over the River Maun and River Meden and 2 roads and seven bridges over the railway. Bevercotes was described as the first fully automated colliery and also the first to be fully equipped to load coal into <b>Merry-go-round</b> <b>trains</b> [...] Trains were fed by four 35 ton weigh hoppers fed from a 4,000 ton storage bunker built by Head Wrightson. The colliery closed in 1993. The line closed after removal of coal stockpiles.|$|R
50|$|This facility, {{opened in}} 1962 for the then South of Scotland Electricity Board (SSEB), was {{constructed}} {{to take advantage}} of post-WW2 expansion of the Fife and Lothian coalfields. Coal was supplied by <b>Merry-go-round</b> <b>trains.</b> It was capable of generating 760 MW peak load, and when commissioned could produce up to one third of Scotland's total electricity needs. Operations ceased in the late 1990s, and the facility had been demolished by 2001. The northern approach to the new Clackmannanshire Bridge built across the Firth of Forth and completed in late 2008 cuts across the extreme west end of the site.The site was used for the storage of a large quantity of track materials for the rebuilding of the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine rail link, which is now operating, and is currently being used as a coal unloading and stockpiling area.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to major areas of wilderness, the park includes several developed features, including environmental education areas, extensive botanical garden, swimming lake, golf course, model farm, miniature <b>train,</b> <b>merry-go-round,</b> and event venue.|$|R
50|$|Worth-mention {{festival of}} Kalna is of-course Mahishmardini Puja. Numbers of people gather on this auspicious {{occasion}} from {{all corners of}} Kalna Subdivision and even from out side. The puja lasts for 4 days. A voluminous fair takes place encircling the religious festival, covering {{almost half of the}} area of Kalna. <b>Merry-go-rounds,</b> Toy <b>Train,</b> Puppet Show, Magic Show etc. are the special attractions of the fair.|$|R
50|$|Balloon loops {{were first}} {{introduced}} on metro and tram lines. They {{did not appear}} on freight railways in large numbers until the 1960s when the modernising British Rail introduced <b>merry-go-round</b> (MGR) coal <b>trains</b> that operated from mines to power stations and back again without shunting.|$|R
50|$|With need to marshall coal traffic, a {{location}} {{close to the}} strategically located Trent Junction became obvious, and hence the development of Toton as a railway yard from the late 19th century. The yards eventually spanned: the Old/New Banks; North Yard; West Yard; Sandiacre Ballast Sidings. Coal traffic reached its peak through the yards post World War II in the 1950s, with over 1million wagons per year passing through {{what was then the}} largest marshalling yard in Europe, and the third largest in the world. Local traffic included coal and iron ore and steel from the nearby Stanton Ironworks. With the coming of the Beeching Axe, British Railways shelved all proposed development of any other marshalling yards, thereby increasing traffic through the yards further. This was the peak of Toton traffic. However, by the 1970s the yard was in decline. With the introduction of <b>Merry-go-round</b> <b>trains</b> direct from colliery to power station, and the decline in the use of domestic coal in favour of North Sea gas, rail traffic through the yards was diminishing quickly. The Down Side ceased hump shunting in 1978, followed by the Up Side in 1984. Many of the yards were lifted during the 1970s and 1980s, and in the late 1980s the yards were rationalised to the basic shape seen today. This was the era when Toton TMD was the home of Class 20, Class 56 and Class 58.|$|R
5|$|Coal is now {{delivered}} to the station mainly using rail transport and is unloaded at the station using a <b>merry-go-round</b> system. <b>Trains</b> supplying the station use the Newbiggin and Lynemouth branch line of the Blyth and Tyne Railway, which also serves the smelter. This line was originally used to export coal from the local coalfield, and also had passenger services. These passenger services ceased in 1964, and now the line is only used to serve the power station and smelter. Coal from the local opencast mines is brought to the station by road using heavy goods vehicles. Coal is graded and washed at the station prior to being burned.|$|R
50|$|By {{the late}} 1990s, a daily train runs between Ford’s plants at Dagenham and Bridgend and <b>merry-go-round</b> coal <b>trains</b> run between Onllwyn and Cwmgwrach (to the west), Tower Colliery, Newport Docks and Avonmouth (to the east), to Aberthaw power station {{averaging}} some 10 trains a day.(These workings were considerably modified by 2016 and the Vale of Neath line to Cwmgwrach was in mothball). Rhoose cement works has closed {{and has been}} demolished but a connection is retained to Tarmac's (LaFarge) Aberthaw cement works where wagons had been stored occasionally but after sporadic use, three cement trains per week were started from December 2016, to Westbury and Moorswater.|$|R

5000|$|In {{later years}} MGR (<b>Merry-Go-Round)</b> coal <b>trains,</b> running direct from pit to power station became the main traffic with the coal carried in block trains of 30, 32-tonne {{capacity}} air-braked wagons. These were normally double-headed by two Class 76 locomotives to their destination with two additional Class 76s banking {{at the rear}} from Wombwell to Silkstone. This was the only section of railway in the UK to be regularly operated by four locomotives per train. A [...] "Clearcall" [...] intercom system (via the overhead electric wires) was developed to allow the crews of {{the front and rear}} locomotives to communicate, replacing earlier air-horn codes.|$|R
50|$|Some {{limitations}} of the Woodhead electrification became apparent, especially {{with the advent of}} the double-headed, double-banked <b>merry-go-round</b> unit <b>trains</b> previously mentioned. Whilst such a train was climbing Worsborough Incline, all other electric trains were prohibited from entering or moving within the power section between Strafford Crossing and Aldam Junction, lest the substations at these two locations tripped out from the high current draw. Heavy current loads also caused flashovers in the oil-impregnated paper-insulated lead-covered 33kV ground-level feeder cable at locations where cable segments were joined together in sealed boxes; such loads were not present in the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway and Great Eastern 1.5kV DC schemes, both of which served only electric multiple units, not locomotive-hauled trains.|$|R
5000|$|A {{temporary}} reprieve for {{the line}} through the site of Staveley Town station was obtained following the closure of Arkwright Colliery in 1988. The Arkwright site was eventually opencasted then landscaped, with startling visual impact. The opencasted coal was transported by lorry along the trackbed of the Great Central Main Line north of Arkwright, thence to Oxcroft Disposal Point near Shuttlewood where it was loaded onto <b>Merry-go-Round</b> (MGR) <b>trains</b> which ran through Oxcroft Colliery Junction, Seymour Junction,the station site and Hall Lane Junction to join the ex-MR Chesterfield to Rotherham [...] "Back Line" [...] at Foxlow Junction. This traffic came to a natural end in 2006. On 4 March 2006 the Branch Line Society ran a [...] "last train" [...] special through the station site to the disposal point boundary.|$|R
50|$|The colliery's main {{customer}} was the Central Electricity Generating Board’s Agecroft Power Station {{close to}} the River Irwell. Coal was transported directly to the power station via an enclosed conveyor belt on a bridge over Agecroft Road (A6044). Some coal was moved by <b>merry-go-round</b> coal hopper <b>trains</b> shuttling between coal mines and the power station. Its closure was announced in November 1992 and demolition on the site commenced in 1993 culminating {{in the destruction of}} its four cooling towers in May 1994.|$|R
5000|$|The Mangyongdae Funfair is an {{amusement}} park located in Mangyongdae-guyok, 12 kilometers from Pyongyang, North Korea. It has an area of 70 hectares including a funfair and wading pool. In fall, 2011 the funfair {{was reported to have}} little or no Korean patronage. [...] It has been alleged that {{there is a lack of}} genuine customers with many visitors being bussed in to the attraction. It had a roller coaster, which, while operational, was in poor repair. There is a <b>merry-go-round</b> and a <b>train</b> ride.|$|R
50|$|The {{first batch}} of Class 20s were {{allocated}} to Devons Road depot in Bow, London to work cross-London transfer freights, {{with the following}} eight locos allocated to Hornsey depot. After a trial with D8006, D8028-D8034 were allocated for work in highland Scotland, and had tablet catcher recesses built into the cabsides. D8035-D8044 were originally to be allocated to Norwich, but were actually used for empty coaching stock (ECS) workings {{in and out of}} London Euston. D8050-D8069 were allocated to the new Tinsley TMD in Sheffield, from where they regularly worked into Lincolnshire and Humberside. D8070-D8127 were sent to operate in the Scottish lowlands, particularly in the Forth-Clyde area, and the Fife coalfield. This completed the original orders for 128 locos, the last being delivered in August 1962.With the subsequent order for a further 100 Class 20 locos, deliveries recommenced with D8128 in January 1966. Tests in 1967 using D8179 and D8317 resulted in locos from D8316 being delivered from the manufacturer with the new electronic control system for working <b>merry-go-round</b> (MGR) coal <b>trains.</b> Trains to Longannet Power Station sometimes required locos to triple-head trains.|$|R
