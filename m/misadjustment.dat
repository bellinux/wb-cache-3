We spectrally modulate {{the output of}} each source by correlative coding it with a distinct filter.

We first prove an identifiability theorem: Under a simple spectral condition on the transmitted random processes, the MIMO channel is uniquely determined, up to a phase offset per user, from the second-order statistics of the received data. We then develop the closed-form algorithm that attains this identifiability bound. We show that minimum-phase finite impulse response filters with arbitrary memory satisfy our sufficient spectral identifiability condition. This results in a computationally attractive scheme for retrieving the data information sequences after the MIMO channel has been identified. We assess the performance of the proposed algorithms by computer simulations.

40|$|The {{major sources}} causing {{deterioration}} of optical quality in extremely large optical telescopes are <b>misadjustments</b> of the mirrors, deformations of monolithic mirrors, and misalignments of segments in segmented mirrors.

It is therefore {{of interest to}} understand {{the similarities and differences}} between the three corresponding types of modes which describe these errors. The first two types are best represented by Zernike polynomials and elastic modes respectively, both of them being continuous and smooth functions. The segment misaligment modes, which are derived by singular value decomposition, are by their nature not smooth and in general discontinuous. However, for mirrors with a large number of segments, the lowest modes become effectively both smooth and continuous. This paper derives analytical expressions for these modes, using differential operators and their adjoints, for the limit case of infinitesimally small segments. For segmented mirrors with approximately 1000 segments, it is shown that these modes agree well with the corresponding lowest singular value decomposition modes. Furthermore, the analytical expressions reveal the nature of the segment misalignment modes and allow for a detailed comparison with the elastic modes of monolithic mirrors.

40|$|Due to {{the unique}} design of the Parallel Rod Test Object (PRoTO) and the {{associated}} semi-automated analysis program, {{it was necessary to}} test it extensively for precision and accuracy, and preliminarily for utility, before its distribution for wider use in MRI system quality control (QC). The test object and analysis program measured the desired quantities reproducibly and they accurately measured predicted changes from intentionally adjusted imaging system parameters, yielding sensitivity of the various test measures to deviation in the system operating parameters. From a single scan of the most recent revision of the test object, multiple quantitative quality control measures were obtained throughout the scanning volume on two MR imaging systems over periods of six and twelve months, respectively. From these and earlier trials, an initial indication was obtained of which performance measures are worth monitoring for QC. This experience suggests that signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and distortion (including display scale) should be monitored but not necessarily the resolution. The latter was only found to alter at the same time or later than other parameters such as SNR had changed. Slice thickness was found to vary on some units and this measure was also used in normalizing the SNR by voxel volume. SNR, distortion, and resolution measurements using field-echo sequences were less stable than those using spin-echo sequences. Use of this QC program to test a wide variety of image quality measures allowed timely assessment of the long-term variability of the units tested. Long-term variability may become among the most important measures for comparison of system performance and maintenance.

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Adaptive filtering is a common solution to many signal processing applications in which the environments are time varying. Its performance is limited by the <b>misadjustment.</b> A method to reduce the <b>misadjustment</b> when the additive noise in the desired signal is correlated is investigated in this work. The proposed method consists of two adaptive components: a modeling filter and a noise whitening filter. The proposed method performs better than the conventional LMS and RLS algorithms both in convergence speed and <b>misadjustment</b> factor. The performance of the adaptive filter when updated using LMS is observed. The improvement factor is proportional to the ratio of the noise power to white innovation power in the desired signal. The reduction in gradient noise allows larger step size, thus increasing the overall performance of the system. Both theoretical and simulation results proved that the proposed method gives a smaller <b>misadjustment</b> and better tracking capability than existing methods...|$|E

Consequently, they suffer from large <b>misadjustment</b> or otherwise slow convergence. A new nonlinear RLS (VFF-NRLS) adaptive algorithm with variable forgetting factor for FIR filter is introduced. In this algorithm, the autocorrelations of non-zero lags, which is insensitive to white noise, is used to control forgetting factor of the nonlinear RLS. This scheme makes the algorithm have fast tracking capability and small <b>misadjustment.</b> By experimental results, it is shown that the new algorithm can outperform other RLS algorithms...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a new {{feedback}} active {{noise control}} (FBANC) system based on Forward-Backward error LMS (FBLMS) predictor, is proposed. The <b>misadjustment</b> of the FBLMS predictor is about half that of the forward error LMS (FLMS) predictor. The new ANC system employs FBLMS predictors both for its main path (MP) predictor and for the noise canceller (NC) for the secondary path (SP) identification (SPI). To realize the MP predictor based on the FBLMS concept, a new FXLMS structure is proposed. But for the NC for the SPI, the FBLMS predictor is directly used. The MP predictor based on FBLMS reduces its <b>misadjustment.</b> Further the use of FBLMS predictor for the NC, as it gives a good prediction of primary noise component in the error (residual noise), improves the SNR for SPI. Thus the improved SP estimate and the reduced <b>misadjustment</b> for the MP predictor achieved, result in a significantly better overall noise reduction (of about 8 dB) over the ANC that uses the MP predictor and noise canceller for SPI, both based only on the forward error LMS algorithm. The computational load for the proposed algorithm is about twice that of FBANC that uses only forward error...|$|E

40|$|Adaptive {{algorithms}} with data-reuse, {{like the}} UNDR-LMS algorithm, have recently received more attention {{due to their}} simple structure and their capability to improve the estimates by repeating the same operation. Since the basic operation is that of an LMS algorithm, {{it is a common}} belief that these algorithms converge towards the Wiener solution. In this paper, a data-reuse algorithm is analyzed that converges to the LS solution instead. The algorithm is similar to Kaczmarz's row projection method, allows, however, un-normalized regression vectors and a wide range of (time-variant) step-sizes. Similar to the LMS algorithm when compared to the Wiener solution, this algorithm also results in a <b>misadjustment</b> proportional to its step-size.
