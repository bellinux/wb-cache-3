5|$|Computer science {{concerns}} {{itself with}} the automatic processing of information (or at least with physical systems of symbols to which information is assigned) by means of such things as computers. From the beginning, computer programmers {{have been able to}} develop programs that permit computers to carry out tasks for which organic beings need a mind. A simple example is multiplication. It is not clear whether computers could be said to have a mind. Could they, someday, come to have what we call a <b>mind?</b> <b>This</b> question has been propelled into the forefront of much philosophical debate because of investigations in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).|$|E

The highest attenuation of homœopathy and the most potent rises above matter into <b>mind.</b> <b>This</b> discovery leads to more light. From it may be learned that either human faith or the divine Mind is the healer and that there is no efficacy in a drug.|$|E

5|$|Mervyn Cowie {{oversaw the}} {{development}} of several of Kenya's national parks and designed them with human visitors in <b>mind.</b> <b>This</b> emphasis helped to make tourism Kenya's primary industry. However, it exacerbated problems between the human population and wildlife. Farmers living next to the parks did not have input into {{the establishment of the}} parks. Locals received very little benefit from the game animals. Livestock is threatened by lions, and some landowners think that Kenya's wildlife is not good for them. In 1948 188,976 people lived in Nairobi, and by 1997 the city's population had grown to 1.5 million. The park is under pressure from the city's growing population and need for farmland. People live right next to the park's boundaries, which creates human-animal conflicts. The human population also creates pollution and garbage. Effluent and industrial waste from factories located along the park's northern boundary contaminate the park's surface and ground water systems.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{discussion}} in this article has focused on one style or tradition of philosophy in modern Western culture, usually called analytic philosophy (sometimes described as Anglo-American philosophy). Many other schools of thought exist, however, which are sometimes subsumed under the broad (and vague) label of continental philosophy. In any case, though topics and methods here are numerous, {{in relation to the}} philosophy of mind the various schools that fall under this label (phenomenology, existentialism, etc.) can globally be seen to differ from the analytic school in that they focus less on language and logical analysis alone but also take in other forms of understanding human existence and experience. With reference specifically to {{the discussion}} of the <b>mind,</b> <b>this</b> tends to translate into attempts to grasp the concepts of thought and perceptual experience in some sense that does not merely involve the analysis of linguistic forms.|$|E
5|$|To {{give each}} world a theme, they were each {{designed}} {{with a particular}} gameplay element in <b>mind.</b> <b>This</b> approach created a structure where players would be introduced to new gameplay mechanics frequently. The intention {{was to keep the}} game engaging and continually expand the depth of gameplay as players progressed through the game. The first stage of each world is designed to be a simple puzzle that teaches players the new mechanic. Initially, the development team were creating large stages that would take a fairly long time to complete. However, they later decided that players should be able to complete them quicker, and thus the level structure was changed and the amount of content per stage was reduced. Story elements were also added to encourage players to keep playing. Creating an intuitive and easy control scheme was an important factor as the development team wanted to ensure that the action of creating boxes was comfortable and fun. The development team had considered implementing a multiplayer mode for BoxBoy!. Utimately, the feature was excluded as they believed that making a fun single-player experience should be the priority.|$|E

5|$|Written by Gerry Davis, this four-part {{story was}} {{submitted}} on spec {{to the production}} office around February 1982. It concerned the Doctor arriving on Mondas {{at a point in}} time when the Cybermen are being created. The rough storyline was where the Doctor and his companion “Felicity” arrive on the planet Mondas, Earth's twin orbiting {{on the opposite side of}} the Sun. While the Doctor works on a piece of TARDIS equipment, Felicity encounters the gentle Prince Sylvan. Sylvan accidentally activates the TARDIS, sending him, the Doctor and Felicity fifty years into the future. There, Sylvan's brother, Dega, is now king and has used the Doctor's device to begin turning his people into Cybermen. He has constructed a space fleet with which he intends to invade the mineral-rich Earth, and plans to kill any unconverted Mondans with cyanide gas. Felicity appeals to Dega's partly Cybernised wife, Queen Meta, and she shoots her husband dead—only to be killed by Dega's chief of staff, Krail. In the confusion, Sylvan and a band of Mondan rebels flee in the spaceships to Earth; the massive concussion of take-off knocks Mondas out of its orbit into deep space. Former script editor Davis submitted this idea circa early 1981, intending it to be a prequel to his and Kit Pedler's original Cyberman serial, The Tenth Planet (which also featured Cyberman Krail). It also borrowed elements from The Ark and The Savages, two stories which Davis had been story editor on. Producer John Nathan-Turner and script editor Antony Root were ultimately not interested in Genesis of the Cybermen. Davis wrote his storyline with only the Doctor and one female companion in mind; he called this character “Felicity” rather than writing with any particular companion in <b>mind.</b> <b>This</b> idea would be later explored in the Big Finish audio adventure Spare Parts by Marc Platt and released in July 2002. In turn Spare Parts was heavily borrowed from for the television episodes Rise of the Cybermen and The Age of Steel in 2006.|$|E
