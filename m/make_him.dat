Chapman makes Homer a fanciful, euphuistic, obscure, and garrulous Elizabethan, but Chapman has fire. Pope <b>makes</b> <b>him</b> a wit, spirited, occasionally noble, full of points, and epigrams, and queer rococo conventionalisms.

Presley was able to <b>make</b> <b>him</b> open up and express himself through their physically intimate moments together. At the time, Jackson was afraid there would never be another who made him feel the way his ex-wife had. He eventually realized he had to move on; he had a world tour coming up and music to work on.

5|$|Thomas F. Wilson, {{known for}} playing the {{character}} Biff Tannen in the Back to the Future films, began his recurring role as policeman Stan Carter.
