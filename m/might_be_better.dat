In 2000 the statue, Cardiff's oldest, was moved to Bute Square, but the location was renamed Callaghan Square in 2002, leading to proposals from local officials that Bute's statue <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> relocated once again, potentially to outside Cardiff Castle.|$|E
5|$|Jerry {{is unable}} {{to decide whether or}} not to tell George he is dating Marlene, but Jerry's ex-girlfriend Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) {{eventually}} convinces him that he should. After being informed, George informs Jerry he has no problem with him dating Marlene. The following night, Jerry asks Marlene to come to his apartment, but she tells him that it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> not to date him anymore. Jerry asks her why, to which she replies that she did not think his stand-up comedy act was funny, and that she could not date someone if she did not respect what they did.|$|E
5|$|Beilhart preached in Chicago and elsewhere, but was {{not known}} to proselytize strongly; however, {{although}} the group typically kept to themselves, their mysterious nature led to misconceptions and suspicion in the press. In 1904, numerous newspaper articles and editorials were written, mostly in Chicago, about the Society. Those articles were often sensationalist and served to put the Society in a bad light. The views and practices of the Society, particularly those against marriage and promoting free love, were not well accepted in the small Ohio community. Thus, in 1904, the group left Lisbon for Chicago where they expected their progressive ideas <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> tolerated.|$|E

5|$|In June 1904, Beilhart {{invited the}} public to an 'open house' where he {{attempted}} to explain the motives and beliefs of the society. Over 400 people attended the gathering. Among them, it has been claimed, were Clarence Darrow and Elbert Hubbard but {{this has not been}} documented, although Beilhart is known to have visited Hubbard in East Aurora and Darrow was a frequent visitor to the society during the Chicago and Ingleside years. In the end, the society's rejection of marriage {{on the grounds that it}} made a 'slave of the woman', and the misinterpretations of their views on free-love were too much for the people of Lisbon to accept. In late 1904, the group left Lisbon for Chicago, in the hope that their progressive ideas <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> tolerated there.|$|E
5|$|Discharged {{from the}} army, Willkie {{returned}} to Elwood. He considered {{a run for}} Congress as a Democrat, but was advised that the district was so Republican he {{would be unlikely to}} keep the seat even if he could win it, and his chances <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> in a more urban area. Herman Willkie wanted Wendell and Robert to rejoin the family law firm, but Henrietta was opposed, feeling that opportunities in Elwood were too limited for her sons. She got her way, and in May 1919 Wendell Willkie successfully applied for a job with the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company in Akron, Ohio as head of the legal office that advised workers on wills and other personal matters. He was soon bored there, and on the advice of his wife, left for a law firm despite an offer from Harvey Firestone to double his salary. Firestone told the departing lawyer that he would never amount to anything because he was a Democrat.|$|E
5|$|Many {{critics have}} {{challenged}} the second premise of this argument, {{by offering a}} biological and sociological account {{of the development of}} human morality which suggests that it is neither objective nor absolute. This account, supported by biologist E. O. Wilson and philosopher Michael Ruse, proposes that the human experience of morality is a by-product of natural selection, a theory philosopher Mark D. Linville calls evolutionary naturalism. According to the theory, the human experience of moral obligations was the result of evolutionary pressures, which attached a sense of morality to human psychology because it was useful for moral development; this entails that moral values do not exist independently of the human mind. Morality <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> understood as an evolutionary imperative in order to propagate genes and ultimately reproduce. No human society today advocates immorality, such as theft or murder, because it would undoubtedly lead to the end of that particular society and any chance for future survival of offspring. Scottish empiricist David Hume made a similar argument, that belief in objective moral truths is unwarranted and to discuss them is meaningless.|$|E

5|$|Returning {{head coach}} Slavoljub Muslin brought Žigić into Red Star's senior squad for the 2003–04 First League season, {{and gave him}} his debut in the {{starting}} eleven on the opening day. That first game ended in defeat, and Žigić's physical appearance– a growth spurt {{from the age of}} 16 had brought his height to – provoked suggestions that he <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> suited to basketball. He scored the second goal as they beat Hajduk Kula 2–0 in the next league match. In between, he produced a hat-trick against Nistru in the 2003–04 UEFA Cup qualifying round, and went on to contribute a further three goals as Red Star beat Odense 6–5 on aggregate in the first round. He scored twice in the 3–0 win in the Eternal Derby against Partizan, and celebrated by miming a basketball shot. By the mid-season break, he had 12 league goals as well as the 6 in the UEFA Cup, and was named Player of the Year for 2003, both by the captains of the First League teams voting via the Večernje novosti newspaper and by the Football Association. He finished the season as the league's top scorer, with 18, as Red Star won their 23rd title, and scored the winning goal in the cup final.|$|E

25|$|Psychologist Frances Cherry has {{suggested}} {{the interpretation of}} the murder as an issue of bystander intervention is incomplete. She has pointed to additional research such as that of Borofsky and Shotland demonstrating that people, especially at that time, were unlikely to intervene if they believed a man was attacking his wife or girlfriend. She {{has suggested}} that the issue <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> understood in terms of male/female power relations.|$|E
25|$|He placed {{second in}} MoveOn.org's primary, behind Dean. He also placed first in other polls, {{particularly}} Internet-based ones. This led many activists {{to believe that}} his showing in the primaries <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> than what Gallup polls had been saying. However, in the non-binding Washington, D.C. primary, Kucinich finished fourth (last out of candidates listed on the ballot), with only 8% of the vote. Support for Kucinich was most prevalent in the caucuses around the country.|$|E
25|$|Debriefing {{is another}} useful strategy. Healthcare {{providers}} meet {{to discuss a}} situation, record what they learned and discuss how it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> handled.

SBAR is a structured system designed to help team members communicate about the patient in the most convenient form possible. Communication between healthcare professionals not only helps achieve the best results for the patient but also prevents any unseen incidents.|$|E

Huckabee has in addition earned personal wealth since 2008 on the lecture circuit and his TV and radio shows. He ended his daily radio show in December 2013, which strengthened speculations about a presidential bid.|$|E
25|$|Li began two megaprojects {{when he was}} the Premier. He {{initiated}} the construction of the Three Gorges Dam on 14 December 1994, and later began preparations for the Shenzhou Manned Space Program. Both programs were subject to much controversy within China and abroad. The Shenzhou program was especially criticized due to its extraordinary cost (tens of billions of dollars) in a country that sometimes referred to itself as a Third World nation. Many economists and humanitarians suggested that those billions in capital <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> invested in helping the Chinese population deal with economic hardships and improvement in the China's education, health services, and legal system.|$|E
25|$|Samuel Scott died in 1886 {{and in time}} William became {{convinced}} that their mill <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> served another way. He canvassed many of his farmer friends and customers for miles around Caledonia persuading them to invest in shares of a new milling firm. There were successful examples in other milling establishments. And so on Feb 16, 1892 The Caledonia Milling Company Limited received its provincial charter and in March, 1892 a Bargain and Sale was recorded: “William Scot and wife and Hugh Scott and wife to The Caledonia Milling Co. Ltd. Supposed flouring mill and an undivided interest in Dam #5 – 2 acres, 2 roods, 9 perches.” (A rood is the fourth part of an acre, and a perch is a land measure of 5 and a half yards).|$|E

25|$|The settlement's {{location}} {{above the}} point where the Esopus came out of the Catskills made it an ideal trading post for Indians responding to the European demand for beaver pelts to make the beaver hats then in vogue. In the later 17th century, with European settlement well established around the eastern Catskills, land replaced fur as the Indian-held commodity most desired by the new arrivals. The English government in London charged local officials with granting large chunks of land on the colonial frontier so that it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> protected from the French to the north and west, but those officials dallied, only making such grants when they could enrich themselves and their friends in the process. The Catskills and the Esopus Valley, with little land that could be cleared for farming, were not suitable to that end.|$|E
25|$|In Lancashire's second innings, Ottis Gibson got {{two quick}} wickets as Lancashire fell to 22 for 3 shortly before stumps {{on the second}} day, but Australians Stuart Law and Andrew Symonds batted well {{together}} with a 111-run partnership before Law was out to Henderson. Symonds powered on from there, bludgeoning 17 fours in his 121, and Glen Chapple and Warren Hegg made season-best scores of 60 and 77 respectively as they added for 121 for the eighth wicket. Lancashire declared on 368 for 9, not bothering to send in James Anderson to bat, thinking he <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> use with the ball. Indeed, he was - he took three for 39 before stumps on day three, as Leicestershire collapsed to 78 for 5 in chase of 399. There wasn't much respite {{on the fourth day}} either - after Dinesh Mongia and Habib had added 27, Anderson came back with two quick wickets, finishing with five for 79. Dominic Cork and debutant leg-spinner Simon Marshall wrapped up the Leicestershire chase as they were all out for 164.|$|E
