5|$|No {{definitive}} antidote for amatoxin poisoning is available, {{but some}} specific treatments such as intravenous penicillin G {{have been shown}} to improve survival. There is some evidence that intravenous silibinin, an extract from the blessed <b>milk</b> <b>thistle</b> (Silybum marianum), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of amatoxins, preventing their uptake by hepatocytes, thereby protecting undamaged hepatic tissue. In patients developing liver failure, a liver transplant is often the only option to prevent death. Liver transplants have become a well-established option in amatoxin poisoning. This is a complicated issue, however, as transplants themselves may have significant complications and mortality; patients require long-term immunosuppression to maintain the transplant. Evidence suggests that, although survival rates have improved with modern medical treatment, in patients with moderate to severe poisoning up to half of those who did recover suffered permanent liver damage. However, a follow-up study has shown that most survivors recover completely without any sequelae if treated within 36hours of mushroom ingestion.|$|E
5|$|No {{definitive}} antidote is available, {{but some}} specific treatments {{have been shown}} to improve survivability. High-dose continuous intravenous penicillin G has been reported to be of benefit, though the exact mechanism is unknown, and trials with cephalosporins show promise. Some evidence indicates intravenous silibinin, an extract from the blessed <b>milk</b> <b>thistle</b> (Silybum marianum), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of death cap poisoning. A long-term clinical trial of intravenous silibinin began in the US in 2010. Silibinin prevents the uptake of amatoxins by liver cells, thereby protecting undamaged liver tissue; it also stimulates DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, leading to an increase in RNA synthesis. According to one report based on a treatment of 60 patients with silibinin, patients who started the drug within 96 hours of ingesting the mushroom and who still had intact kidney function all survived. As of February 2014 supporting research has not yet been published.|$|E

25|$|Alcoholic {{liver disease}} is a major public health problem. For example, in the United States up to two million people have alcohol-related liver disorders. Chronic alcohol abuse can cause fatty liver, {{cirrhosis}} and alcoholic hepatitis. Treatment options are limited and consist of most importantly discontinuing alcohol consumption. In cases of severe liver disease, the only treatment option may be a liver transplant from alcohol abstinent donors. Research is being conducted into the effectiveness of anti-TNFs. Certain complementary medications, e.g., <b>milk</b> <b>thistle</b> and silymarin, appear to offer some benefit. Alcohol is {{a leading cause of}} liver cancer in the Western world, accounting for 32-45% of hepatic cancers. Up to half a million people in the United States develop alcohol-related liver cancer. Moderate alcohol consumption also increases the risk of liver disease.|$|E

Silibinin prevents the uptake of amatoxins by hepatocytes, thereby protecting undamaged hepatic tissue; it also stimulates DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, leading to an increase in RNA synthesis. N-acetylcysteine has shown promise in combination with other therapies. Animal studies indicate the amatoxins deplete hepatic glutathione; N-acetylcysteine serves as a glutathione precursor and may therefore prevent reduced glutathione levels and subsequent liver damage. None of the antidotes used have undergone prospective, randomized clinical trials, and only anecdotal support is available. Silibinin and N-acetylcysteine appear to be the therapies with the most potential benefit. Repeated doses of activated carbon may be helpful by absorbing any toxins that are returned to the gastrointestinal tract following enterohepatic circulation. Other methods of enhancing the elimination of the toxins have been trialed; techniques such as hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, plasmapheresis, and peritoneal dialysis have occasionally yielded success but overall do not appear to improve outcome.|$|E

50|$|This weevil is {{native to}} Eurasia and North Africa. It was first {{introduced}} to the United States for thistle biocontrol in 1969, {{and it is now}} widely established in that country.

Proteolysis in 35 -day-old Serra cheese was quantitatively high [average values of 34. 6 % and 11. 9 % for WSN/TN (total nitrogen) and 2 % TCA-N/TN, respectively], but qualitatively low (average values of 5. 8 % and 1. 2 % for 12 % TCA-N/TN and 5 % PTA-N/TN, respectively). The ratios WSN/TN and 2 % TCA-N/TN were lowest for cheeses ripened in February, whereas the ratio 12 % TCA-N/TN was highest for cheeses ripened in November.

40|$|Six {{different}} types of bacteria (five strains of lactic acid bacterium and one strain of coliform) isolated from 35 -day-old Serra cheese were assayed for proteolytic and lipolytic activities on milk agar and tributyrin agar, respectively. Peptidase and lipase activities were further studied via analytical assaying of free amino acids by spectrophotometry and of free fatty acids by HPLC in in vitro curdled milk (previously prepared from heat-sterilized ovine <b>milk</b> coagulated with <b>thistle</b> flower) subject to ripening for 21  days at 5 [*]°C and 95 % relative humidity. Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. mesenteroides/dextranicum and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis displayed significant proteinase and peptidase activities, where Leuconostoc lactis and Enterococcus faecium only exhibited peptidase activity. Leuc. mesenteroides ssp. mesenteroides/dextranicum, Ent. faecium, and L. lactis ssp. lactis only showed lipase activity on milk fat after a long incubation period. Short- and medium-chain fatty acid residues were released preferentially by microbial lipases, although long-chain fatty acids were also significantly released by lipases from Leuc. mesenteroides ssp. mesenteroides/ dextranicum. Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei and Hafnia alvei did not display measurable protease, peptidase, or lipase activities. In view of their hydrolase activities, {{it is suggested that}} L. lactis ssp. lactis and Leuconostoc spp. (with possible incorporation of Ent. faecium) are a potential mixed-strain starter for Serra cheesemaking...|$|R
40|$|Hepatic {{homeostasis}} and metabolism {{are essential}} for survi-val in critically ill and severely burned patients. Silymarin, the major component of <b>thistle</b> <b>milk</b> {{has been shown to}} have hepatoprotective effect. In this study the effect of silymarin on the liver of burned rats was investigated. Wistar Albino rats were exposed to 900 C bath for 10 seconds to induce skin burn. Silymarin either locally (30 mg/kg) applied on 4 cm 2 area or locally+systemically (50 mg/kg p. o) was administe-red after burn and repeated twice daily. Rats were decapita-ted 48 h after injury and blood was collected for tumor nec-rosis factor-α (TNF- α) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity. In liver tissue samples, total protein, tissue factor activity (TF) and activities of carbonic anhydrase (CA), glu-tathione-S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), alkalen and acid phosphatase (ALP, ACP respectively) enzymes were determined. In addition polyacy-rlamid gel electrophoresis was carried on liver tissue samp-les. Burn caused a significant increase in blood TNF- α and LDH levels. Total protein levels and ALP activity increa-sed and SOD activity decreased in the liver tissue at 48 h after burn. Both local and systemic silymarin treatment significantly reversed this parameters except ALP. Silyma-rin treatment significantly increased ALP activity. Local silymarin treatment increased, CAT and ACP activities and decreased TF activity compared to control and burn group; and increased CA activity compared to systemic+local sily-marin treatment. Addition of systemic silymarin treatment to local silymarin treatment reversed these effects of local treatment to control group levels. Non significant differen-ces were found between protein bands obtained in electrop-horesis. Minor liver damage was obvious 48 h after thermal skin burn.
