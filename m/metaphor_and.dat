5|$|Following the Great Fire of Smyrna, Lefty and Desdemona {{must start}} life anew. When she is 14years old, Callie {{experiences}} a second birth to become Cal. To become a male, Callie peregrinates across the United States {{and becomes a}} midwife of her new life by teaching herself to forget what she has learned as a female. Likewise, Cal's grandparents undergo a transformation, becoming husband and wife instead of brother and sister. Middlesex delves into the concept of identity, including how it is formed {{and how it is}} administered. The immigrant predicament is a <b>metaphor</b> <b>and</b> synecdoche for Calliope's hermaphroditic condition; Callie's paternal grandparents become Americanized through the amalgamation of the elements of heredity, cultural metamorphoses, and probability. Callie's maternal grandfather, Jimmy Zizmo, undergoes a rebirth when he transforms from a bootlegger into Fard Muhammad, a Muslim minister.|$|E
5|$|In China, {{the tree}} of heaven has a long and rich history. It was {{mentioned}} in the oldest extant Chinese dictionary and listed in countless Chinese medical texts for its purported ability to cure ailments ranging from mental illness to baldness. The roots, leaves and bark are still used today in traditional Chinese medicine, primarily as an astringent. The tree has been grown extensively both in China and abroad as a host plant for the ailanthus silkmoth, a moth involved in silk production. Ailanthus has {{become a part of}} western culture as well, with the tree serving as the central <b>metaphor</b> <b>and</b> subject matter of the best-selling American novel A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith.|$|E
40|$|Our {{lives are}} affected, knowingly or unknowingly through the usage <b>and</b> {{influence}} of <b>metaphors</b> <b>and</b> symbols. This paper attempts to highlight {{an overview of}} their presence {{as seen from the}} aspect of ESL reading comprehension by a group of selected respondents. It also provides some insights into the roles of <b>metaphors</b> <b>and</b> symbols being utilised in the ESL learning class. The impact and application of the roles played by <b>metaphors</b> <b>and</b> symbols have been greatly used by writers. This paper also seeks to focus on analytical and descriptive details such as looking at the students' perception of <b>metaphors</b> <b>and</b> symbols as used in certain reading comprehension passages, the percentage of students who were able to interpret the precise meaning of <b>metaphors</b> <b>and</b> symbols correctly, and lastly the interface of students' background knowledge with the presupposed meaning of <b>metaphors</b> <b>and</b> symbols. Using open-ended questions, the responses of respondents regarding the usage <b>and</b> influence of <b>metaphors</b> <b>and</b> symbols in an ESL reading comprehension class were analysed. It is hoped that the findings will be beneficial to educators and readers alike and will serve as a framework for future research into the elements of <b>metaphors</b> <b>and</b> symbols as used in the literary field...|$|R
40|$|Many authors {{stress the}} {{importance}} of basing teaching on students' prior knowledge. To build a bridge between students' everyday knowledge and scientific concepts, the role of <b>metaphors</b> <b>and</b> analogies came into the focus of the science education community during the past two decades. Approaches using metaphor-based teaching strategies often regard <b>metaphors</b> <b>and</b> analogies as teaching tools that can be adopted by a teacher. On the basis of the theoretical framework of experientialism, we argue that not only teaching but also thinking about and understanding science without <b>metaphors</b> <b>and</b> analogies is not possible. An analysis of studies dealing with <b>metaphors</b> <b>and</b> analogies in science education shows that instructional analogies <b>and</b> <b>metaphors</b> are often not understood as intended or not used by students in their own explanations. By reanalyzing 199 instructional <b>metaphors</b> <b>and</b> analogies {{on the basis of a}} metaphor analysis, we show that it takes more than making a connection to everyday life to communicate science fruitfully. We show that good instructional <b>metaphors</b> <b>and</b> analogies need embodied sources. These embodied sources are everyday experiences conceptualized in, for example, schemata such as containers, paths, balances, and up and down. For the analysis, we introduce the concept of conceptual metaphors for analyzing metaphors as well as analogies...|$|R
40|$|Although metaphor {{has been}} a subject of study for centuries, few {{experimental}} studies have attempted to demonstrate the persuasive power of messages containing metaphors. Moreover, it is rarely acknowledged that <b>metaphors</b> <b>and</b> analogies can serve as valuable tools to tailor messages {{to the values of}} culturally diverse populations. This dissertation outlines the utility of incorporating <b>metaphors</b> <b>and</b> analogies within persuasive messages and advances a method for generating culturally appropriate <b>metaphors</b> <b>and</b> analogies. The literature on the neurophysiological basis of figurative language processing is reviewed in an attempt to uncover the origin of the persuasive power of metaphor. This literature leads {{to the development of the}} concept of Literal Mindedness as a way to explain individual differences in responses to figurative language. The Literal Mindedness Inventory is developed as part of this dissertation research, and its convergent validity with Need for Cognition also is established. Finally, an experiment was conducted to test the effect of <b>metaphors</b> <b>and</b> analogies and Literal Minedness on persuasion. To assess the effect of <b>metaphors</b> <b>and</b> analogies on the reception of persuasive health messages (HIV prevention/pro-condom messages), nine messages representing three levels of <b>metaphors</b> <b>and</b> analogies were tested on outcome measures such as fear, efficacy, message evaluation, and knowledge and attitudes. The hypotheses advanced in this study were partially supported, and form the basis of a number of recommendations for future research...|$|R
5|$|While Zwingli {{carried on}} the {{political}} work of the Swiss Reformation, he developed his theological views with his colleagues. The famous disagreement between Luther and Zwingli on {{the interpretation of the}} eucharist originated when Andreas Karlstadt, Luther's former colleague from Wittenberg, published three pamphlets on the Lord's Supper in which Karlstadt rejected the idea of a real presence in the elements. These pamphlets, published in Basel in 1524, received the approval of Oecolampadius and Zwingli. Luther rejected Karlstadt's arguments and considered Zwingli primarily to be a partisan of Karlstadt. Zwingli began to express his thoughts on the eucharist in several publications including de Eucharistia (On the Eucharist). He attacked the idea of the real presence and argued that the word is {{in the words of the}} institution—"This is my body, this is my blood"—means signifies. Hence, the words are understood as a <b>metaphor</b> <b>and</b> Zwingli claimed that there was no real presence during the eucharist. In effect, the meal was symbolic of the Last Supper.|$|E

25|$|Jorge Luis Borges, Argentina's most {{acclaimed}} {{writer and}} one of the foremost figures in the history of literature, found new ways of looking at the modern world in <b>metaphor</b> <b>and</b> philosophical debate and his influence has extended to authors all over the globe.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{understanding}} of <b>metaphors</b> <b>and</b> symbols by children of older school age, i. e. the period of adolescence. Subsequently it turns to the conception of <b>metaphors</b> <b>and</b> symbols in individual areas of human life and thinking. It {{is concerned with the}} area of aesthetics, in particular with art, drama, music and literature. Further, it studies the conception of <b>metaphors</b> <b>and</b> symbols in philosophy, sociology, psychology (especially social and depth psychology), religion and bible studies. The practical part sums up the findings introduced in the theoretical part and infers from them the consequences for the religious pedagogy and didactics of symbol focused on the older school age. In the final part, several exemplary teaching lessons are outlined, which correspond to the introduced theoretical and practical pedagogical findings and which aim at helping the adolescents to disclose the world of <b>metaphors</b> <b>and</b> symbols not only in religious sphere...|$|R
25|$|American Modernist poet Hart Crane {{used the}} Brooklyn Bridge {{as a central}} <b>metaphor</b> <b>and</b> {{organizing}} structure for his second and most important book of poetry, The Bridge. This book {{takes the form of}} a long poem spanning eight parts, beginning with an ode ("Proem: To Brooklyn Bridge") and ending with a transfigured vision of the bridge as the unifying symbol of America ("Atlantis"). Crane briefly lived in an apartment overlooking the bridge that, he later learned, once housed Washington Roebling, the Brooklyn Bridge's builder and son of its architect, John A. Roebling.|$|E
25|$|Argentine {{literature}} {{of that period}} was fiercely nationalist. It {{was followed by the}} modernist movement, which emerged in France in the late 19th century, and this period in turn was followed by vanguardism, with Ricardo Güiraldes as an important reference. Jorge Luis Borges, its most acclaimed writer, found new ways of looking at the modern world in <b>metaphor</b> <b>and</b> philosophical debate, and his influence has extended to writers all over the globe. Borges is most famous for his works in short stories, such as Ficciones and The Aleph.|$|E
25|$|As Van Slyck (1991) showed, {{the last}} years of the 19th century saw {{acceptance}} of the idea that free libraries should be available to the American public. But the design of the idealized free library was the subject of prolonged and heated debate. On one hand, the library profession called for designs that supported efficiency in administration and operation; on the other, wealthy philanthropists favored buildings that reinforced the paternalistic <b>metaphor</b> <b>and</b> enhanced civic pride. Between 1886 and 1917, Carnegie reformed both library philanthropy and library design, encouraging a closer correspondence between the two.|$|E

40|$|This study’s {{hypotheses}} {{are based}} on the associative network model of memory proposed by Anderson (1984, 1985), and Anderson and Bower (1972).

The results of the study indicate that the type of metaphorical rhetoric in Chinese-language print advertisements, as well as the differences in message cues, will influence a customer’s memory of those advertisements. In particular, advertisements utilizing symbol-resembling <b>metaphors</b> <b>and</b> appearance-resembling <b>metaphors,</b> along with message cues consisting primarily of product pictures, yield relatively good advertisement memory.
