The 351-4V CJ was new for 1972 and offered a number of performance enhancing features not offered on the 1970–71 351C-4V. It included a special intake manifold, modified camshaft, special valve springs and dampers, a 750 CFM Motorcraft Carburetor, 4-bolt <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> and [...] dual exhaust. The 351 CJ was the only engine equipped with dual exhaust and it was the only engine that could be mated to the available four-speed transmission. The Ram Air induction system was available, and could be equipped on 351 CJ and 429 powered cars.

2500|$|The updated VQ35HR is more {{powerful}} ( [...] at 6,800 rpm and [...] at 4,800 rpm), more fuel efficient, and more responsive than the previous VQ35DE. The [...] "HR" [...] stands for [...] "High Revolution" [...] or [...] "High Response". A dual-path intake (two air cleaners, throttle bodies, etc.) lowers intake tract restriction by 18 percent and new equal-length exhaust manifolds lead into mufflers that are 25 percent freer flowing. The intake is said to benefit from a ram-air effect adding three horsepower at 60mph. Electrically actuated variable valve timing is new on the exhaust cams which broadens the torque curve. The new engine block maintains the same bore and stroke, but the connecting rods were lengthened and the block deck was raised by 8.4mm to reduce piston side-loads. 80% of the internal components have been strengthened or redesigned to handle the increased 7,500 rpm red line, along {{with the use of}} larger crank bearings with <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> reinforced by a rigid ladder-type main cap girdle. With an increase in compression ratio from 10.3:1 to 10.6:1 these changes add 26 more horsepower. Torque is down [...] from the old DE engine (268 vs. 270).

But, the studies of actual machine parts {{under the influence of}} dynamic load are rare explained. Here the studies of breakage in <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> siud at diesel engine are achieved and its solutlhn is proved. The results are summarized as follows: 1. The insufficient rigidity of engine bed is most cause of breakage in <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> studs at diesel engine. 2. Seconrlly, the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> stud suffered severe load by the weak structure of <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> and therfore the better type of structure is recommended by the writer. 3.

50|$|Mark IV engines saw {{extensive}} {{application in}} Chevrolet and GMC medium duty trucks, {{as well as}} in Blue Bird Corporation's All American and TC/2000 transit buses (the latter up until 1995, using a 427 with purpose-built carburetor). In addition to the 427, a 366-cubic-inch (6.0 L) version was produced for the commercial market. Both the 366 and 427 commercial versions were built with a raised-deck, four-bolt <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>cap</b> cylinder to accommodate an extra oil control ring on the pistons. Unfortunately, the raised deck design complicated the use of the block in racing applications, as standard intake manifolds required spacers for proper fit. Distributors with adjustable collars that allowed adjustments to the length of the distributor shaft also had to be used with 366 and 427 truck blocks.|$|R

Of course, all power ratings in the sixties were also done in SAE Gross Horsepower, which is measured based on an engine without accessories or air filter or restrictive stock exhaust manifold, invariably giving a significantly higher rating than the engine actually produces when installed in the automobile. SAE Net Horsepower is measured with all accessories, air filters and factory exhaust system in place; this is the standard that all US automobile engines have been rated at since 1972. With big-block V-8s being the order of the day, there was less demand for the 327, so small-block offerings were cut from five to two for 1966, and only the basic 300- and 350-bhp versions were retained. Both required premium fuel on compression ratios well over 10.0:1, and they didn't have the rocket-like thrust of the 427s, but their performance was impressive all the same. As before, both could be teamed with the Powerglide automatic, the standard three-speed manual, or either four-speed option.|$|E

50|$|The VG {{engine family}} {{consists}} of V6 piston engines designed and produced by Nissan for several {{vehicles in the}} Nissan lineup. The VG series started in 1983 becoming Japan's first mass-produced V6 engine. VG engines displace between 2.0 L and 3.3 L and feature an iron block and aluminum heads. The early VG engines featured a SOHC arrangement with 2 valves per cylinder. A later revision featured a slightly different block, and a DOHC arrangement which utilized 4 valves per cylinder and Nissan's own version of variable valve timing for a smoother idle and more torque at low to medium engine speeds. The block features a single piece <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>cap.</b> The production blocks and production head castings were used successfully in the Nissan GTP ZX-Turbo and NPT-90 race cars which won the IMSA GT Championship {{three years in a}} row.|$|R
50|$|A cross-bolted bearing is a bearing, {{usually a}} {{crankshaft}} <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> of a piston engine. Most <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> are retained by two bolts, {{one on each}} side of the bearing journal, and parallel to the cylinder axis. A cross-bolted bearing has one or more additional bolts, at right-angles to both the cylinder and crankshaft axes.

5000|$|Testing of the 406, {{with its}} higher power levels, led to cross-bolted mains [...] - [...] that is, <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>caps</b> that were secured {{not only by}} bolts at each end coming up from beneath, but also by bolts {{coming in from the}} sides through the block.

5000|$|A {{crankcase}} {{often has}} {{an opening in}} the bottom to which an oil pan is attached with a gasketed bolted joint.

Some crankcase areas require no structural strength from the oil pan itself (in which case the oil pan is typically stamped from sheet steel), whereas other crankcase designs do (in which case the oil pan is a casting in its own right).

40|$|This master thesis was {{performed}} at Scania CV AB in Södertälje at the engine development department, NMKA and at Scania Latin America in Sao Paolo, Brazil. Scania {{is a global}} company with operations in Europe, Latin America, Asia, Africa and Australia. Scania is the world’s third largest manufacturer for heavy trucks and heavy bus segment. The constant development of new design solutions demands more stable mounting in Scanias production. Assemblies with new screw joints with different parameters affect {{the value of the}} clamping force for the joint and consequently the final product. It is critical that the screw joint has the right clamping force to assure that it fulfils its purpose. Large deviations can result in total loss of clamping force and engine breakdown. The purpose with this master thesis was to find the most important factors that affect the clamping force and form the basis of how different screw joints should be handled. Knowledge about Scania screw joints were collected by working in the production, observing drawings, a thorough literature study and by interviewing representatives from different departments. The problems regarding screw joints were found to be rather different at the departments and the problems had been an issue {{for a longer period of}} time. The mapping of screw joints resulted in a number of interesting screw joints with different kinds of problems. A discussion about the interesting screw joints was held in order to select joints to take a closer look at. By focusing on area of interest, area of responsibility and resources, five screw joints were selected, rocker arm shaft, <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>cap,</b> connecting rod and the oil sump in both aluminum and steel. The chosen screw joints represented specific types of screw joints on which the chosen parameters were tested. The important parameters that were tested are driver speed, friction and settlement. The equipment that was used throughout the work was the Ultrasonic, which measures the length of a screw with ultrasound. The authors feel that the equipment has given reliable results and that it has been easy and convenient to use during the tests since time consuming strain gages were avoided. The test results shows that the speed of the nut runner has a great influence on the clamping force and torque. Depending on the nut runner and which kind of screw joint that is examined the clamping force and torque varies. The friction affects the result of the tightening substantially, especially when tightening by torque. If torque and angle tightening is used it is an advantage to keep the initial torque as low as possible but high enough to keep the surfaces tight together before applying the angle. The test results regarding settlement show that the settlement is extremely dependent on the ingoing parts in the screw joint. Parameters such as screw and clamped parts affect both the tightening procedure and degree of settlement. The authors recommendations are that a decision has to be made about what information is important for each department. Furthermore, as the tightening procedure is really important for the final clamping force it is advisable to decide which department that is responsible of making the correct tightening parameters of a specific screw joint in the production. Hopefully this master thesis has woken an interest which in the future can make a difference for an even more stable production and in the end an even better quality at Scania CV AB.

40|$|Volvo Car Corporation uses a new {{generation}} of four cylinder inline engines in their automobiles. The engine family is known as Volvo Engine Architecture and the differences between the different engines are the different power outputs made possible with different engine boosts. The VEA engines utilise a bedplate design for their engines where the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports are casted into the bedplate. For the high performance engines the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports need to be sprayed with an aluminium alloy to get a strong bonding with the bedplate. The spraying is, however, expensive and an alternative solution is sought. Four design proposals, which are based on the current design of the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports, were proposed. These design proposals does not use any of the sprayed aluminium alloy material. Instead they have been designed with the goal of getting a mechanical bonding, instead of the chemical bonding that the aluminium alloy coating provides. The design proposals were evaluated by static simulations and dynamic simulations to investigate the influence on the <b>main</b> <b>bearings</b> in terms of: • radial deformations of the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> profiles, • total pressure and asperity contact pressure and • friction losses. The contact behaviour between the bedplate and the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports, for the different design proposals, at high temperature were also investigated. The results from the simulations were compared to results from earlier work on the sprayed <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports. None of the design proposals generally provided lower friction losses compared to the sprayed <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> support. The differences in friction loss should also by weighed against the potential cost saving, which is a question for VCC. The sprayed <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports showed in general higher asperity contact pressure compared to the design proposals. Most of the bonding between the bedplate and the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports occurred on the top surfaces and the sides of the <b>main</b> <b>bearing</b> supports for the different design proposals. An investigation of getting fatigue failure in the bedplate should also be considered, if VCC should proceed with {{one or more of the}} design proposals.
