50|$|For dogs a {{different}} elimination occurs, with is essentially as the unchanged drug. The {{reason for this}} difference in species, results from the dog having an higher dependence on biliary excretion of the unchanged drug for clearance. The value of the plasma clearance for dogs (0.2 ml <b>min-1</b> kg-1), is 20 fold lower than the value for rats (4.1 ml <b>min-1</b> kg-1), a species which is capable of metabolism. This difference leads to the different clearance route. Which becomes saturated after administration of a toxic dose of the drug.|$|E

50|$|The {{distinctive}} quality of dibucaine {{is that its}} enzyme inhibition of the wild type butyrylcholinesterase (Typical) is substantially {{greater than that of}} the mutant butyrylcholinesterase (Atypical). Thus, the atypical enzyme is said to be resistant to dibucaine inhibition. This can be used to distinguish individuals in the aforementioned genetic classes. Lockridge and La Du measured atypical and usual human serum cholinesterases with the fluorescent probe, N-methyl-(7-dimethylcarbamoxy)quinolinium iodide. Four active sites per tetramer were found in each enzyme. The turnover numbers of usual and atypical cholinesterases were the same: 15,000 mumol of benzoylcholine hydrolyzed/min/mumol of active site; 48,000 <b>min-1</b> for o-nitrophenylbutyrate; and 0.0025 <b>min-1</b> for N-methyl-(7-dimethylcarbamoxy)quinolinium iodide. They had identical rate constants for carbamylation, (5.0 <b>min-1)</b> and for decarbamylation (0.15 h-1). The major difference between the two genetically determined forms of the enzyme was substrate affinity, KD being 0.16 mM for usual and 5.4 mM for atypical cholinesterase, for the fluorescent probe substrate. Km for the uncharged ester, o-nitrophenylbutyrate, was 0.14 mM for both enzymes, whereas Km for benzoylcholine was 0.005 mM for usual and 0.024 mM for atypical cholinesterase. We interpret these data to mean that the two enzymes differ only in the structure of their anionic site.|$|E

50|$|The {{intensity}} of the vibration refers to the amplitude {{and the frequency of}} the vibration. It can affect the screening performance in many aspects. Amplitude is defined as the distance travelled by the screen in one circle. In the Tumbler Screening case, the screening is moving in three dimensions. The movement of the particles is determined by the vibration. Inappropriate vibration speed will lead to segregation, resulting in uneven distribution of the particles on the screen. Small particles will be over oversized particles and not being sieved. This will decrease the screening efficiency significantly. Another reason why vibration intensity is important is that it will affect the contacts number of particles with screening. If the vibrating speed is too fast, the particle will go forward along the screen, reducing the possibility that the particles will pass through. But a high number of contact attempts will increase the screening effect as the residual time of the particles will be reduced. When the screen is moving too slow, it will cause fluctuation, which will decrease the efficiency. The common speed range is 180 to 280 <b>min-1,</b> and the common amplitude applied to the screener is 60 to 80 mm horizontally and 5 to 40 mm vertically.|$|E

40|$|OBJETIVO: O objetivo do estudo foi determinar o gasto energético (GE) em termos de gasto calórico e equivalente metabólico (MET) de duas sessões de um protocolo de exercício. MÉTODOS: Quinze indivíduos adultos (51, 0 ± 5, 5 anos) realizaram as sessões de exercício (80 min), compostas por (aquecimento, caminhada e flexibilidade; Sessão A) e (aquecimento, caminhada e resistência muscular local; Sessão B). A frequência cardíaca (FC) foi medida durante cada parte da sessão. Em laboratório, foram medidos, em dias diferentes, o consumo máximo de oxigênio (VO 2 max), durante repouso e exercício (usando a FC média obtida nas aulas), por calorimetria indireta. O MET dos exercícios foi obtido dividindo VO 2 em exercício (mL. kg-¹. <b>min-¹)</b> pelo VO 2 em repouso (mL. kg-¹. <b>min-¹).</b> O GE dos exercícios foi calculado por: MET x Peso (kg) x Tempo (min) / 60.

Heart hate (HR) was measured during {{each part of the}} sessions. In laboratory environment, maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2 max) and oxygen uptake at rest and exercise conditions (using mean HR obtained in classes) were measured on different days, using indirect calorimetry.

40|$|Background While {{epinephrine}} infusion {{is widely}} used in critical care for inotropic support, {{there is no direct}} method to detect the onset and measure the magnitude of this response. We hypothesised that surrogate measurements, such as heart rate and vascular tone, may indicate if the plasma and tissue concentrations of epinephrine and cAMP are in a range sufficient to increase myocardial contractility. Methods Cardiovascular responses to epinephrine infusion (0. 05 - 0. 5 mcg kg⁻¹ <b>min⁻¹)</b> were measured in rats using arterial and left ventricular catheters. Epinephrine and cAMP levels were measured using ELISA techniques. Results The lowest dose of epinephrine infusion (0. 05 mcg kg⁻¹ <b>min⁻¹)</b> did not raise plasma epinephrine levels and did not lead to cardiovascular response. Incremental increase in epinephrine infusion (0. 1 mcg kg⁻¹ <b>min⁻¹)</b> elevated plasma but not myocardial epinephrine levels, providing vascular, but not cardiac effects. Further increase in the infusion rate (0. 2 mcg kg⁻¹ <b>min⁻¹)</b> raised myocardial tissue epinephrine levels sufficient to increase heart rate but not contractility. Inotropic and lusitropic effects were significant at the infusion rate of 0. 3 mcg kg⁻¹ <b>min⁻¹.</b> Correlation of plasma epinephrine to haemodynamic parameters suggest that as plasma concentration increases, systemic vascular resistance falls (EC 50 = 47 pg/ml), then HR increases (ED 50 = 168 pg/ml), followed by a rise in contractility and lusitropy (ED 50 = 346 pg/ml and ED 50 = 324 pg/ml accordingly). Conclusions The dose response of epinephrine is distinct for vascular tone, HR and contractility. The need for higher doses to see cardiac effects is likely due to the threshold for drug accumulation in tissue. Successful inotropic support with epinephrine cannot be achieved unless the infusion is sufficient to raise the heart rate...|$|E
40|$|The studies {{presented}} in this thesis were conducted to develop two minimum fitness standards, one for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and the second for the Oil and Gas Industry. This provided the opportunity to compare across the essential tasks and resultant standards. The following stages were used for both the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and Oil and Gas Industry: a. Review the tasks requiring a significant physical fitness component (Task Analysis); b. Determine {{the importance of the}} physically demanding tasks and identify those which are critical for success and safe work (Task Assessment); c. Establish the method of best practice (Technique) for undertaking the essential tasks; d. Establish and agree the minimum performance standard for the essential tasks (Task Performance) when performed using the method of best practice; e. Assess the physical and physiological demands of these tasks (Task Quantification); f. Design and validate a simple-to-administer minimum fitness standard. The essential tasks and fitness requirements of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency fell into three groups, these were: Group 1 (All Operations) : achieve a maximum aerobic score of at least 31 mL. kg-¹. <b>min-¹</b> based on the aerobic demand of 21. 8 mL. kg-¹. <b>min-¹</b> required to carry a stretcher at the head-end 200 m at a speed of 3. 2 km. h-¹; continuously lift a 3 kg sledge hammer 10 times above shoulder height, based on hammering a stake into the ground; pull a rope, with a resistance of 35 kg, and maintain this load for 15 s based on manning a main rescue-line; carry a 19 kg hand-held load 200 m in 3 min 45 s allow 3 min 45 s rest, then carry a 25. 5 kg hand held load, 200 m in 3 min 45 s, based on the ability to carry a stretcher (89 kg) as part of a four person team. Group 2 (Rope Technicians) should complete all the tasks as Group 1, plus pass all the technical competencies currently in place for Rope Technicians. Group 3 (Mud Technicians) as Group 1, plus achieve a predicted maximum aerobic score of at least 39 mL. kg- ¹. <b>min-¹</b> based on the aerobic demand of 27. 4 mL. kg-¹. <b>min-¹</b> required to pull a stretcher across the mud at 0. 8 km. h-¹, (this equates to covering 200 m in 15 minutes), prior to performing a simulated mud rescue. The essential tasks and the minimum fitness requirements of the Oil and Gas Industry were: Stair and Ladder-Climbing, achieve a predicted maximum aerobic score of at least 31 mL. kg-¹. <b>min-¹</b> based on the aerobic demand of 23. 4 mL. kg- ¹. <b>min-¹</b> required to climb a flight of stairs at a rate of 80 steps. <b>min-¹</b> and 23. 6 mL. kg- ¹. <b>min-¹</b> to climb a ladder at 24 rungs. min-¹; Manual Handling, based on the requirement to climb a flight of stairs at a rate of 80 steps. <b>min-¹</b> for a minute carrying a load of 10 kg, 20 kg or 25 kg; Valve Turning, based on the requirement to continuously turn a medium size valve (25. 4 cm diameter) set at a torque of 8. 3 N. m, for 5 min; Emergency Response Team, achieve a predicted maximum aerobic score of at least 41 mL. kg-¹. min ¹, based on the aerobic demand of 30. 7 mL. kg-¹. <b>min-¹</b> required to pull a trailer/foam monitor at a speed of 5 km. h-¹. If trailer/foam monitors are not used achieve a predicted maximum aerobic score of at least 39 mL. kg-¹. <b>min-¹</b> based on the aerobic demand of 28. 9 mL. kg-¹. <b>min-¹</b> required to climb a ladder at 34. 5 rungs. <b>min-¹.</b> Stretcher carry 89 kg either in a two or four person lift (dependant on the facility), rope haul the heaviest anticipated load (10 kg first aid kit) up 10 m gantry, roll out a 23 m fire hose. There were no time constraints recommended for hauling kit and rolling out a hose. For those essential tasks that could not be assessed by a direct task measurement or a direct task simulation, a Predictive selection test was recommended and validated. Prediction intervals were used {{to take into account the}} inherent error between the predictive tests and the direct measurements, to determine “Pass”, “Borderline” and “Fail” categories. As a result of this work a modular approach was adopted in which individuals only undertake those test applicable to their job, with a combination of direct task measurements, direct task simulations, and Predictive selection tests recommended. It is suggested that, where possible, the use of a direct task measurement or simulation should either be progressive e. g. stretcher-carrying, or performed after a Predictive selection test, in order to reduce the risk of injury when the individuals proceed to undertake the direct task measurement or simulation e. g. manual handling. This approach has meant that consideration is given to the health and safety of the individuals undertaking the fitness standard whilst maintaining a high level of face validity.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate and compare the human responses to two load carriage tasks performed with three different load masses and on three different gradients. The task of carrying hydrogel in one hand was observed in a silviculture industry and crude physiological and perceptual responses were measured. This task was simulated in a laboratory setting together with a suggested intervention of backpack carriage. Eighteen conditions were established which consisted of the two modes of carriage and a combination of three load masses (9 kg, 12 kg and 15 kg) and three gradients (5 %, 10 % and 15 %). Twenty eight Rhodes University female students comprised the sample and the experimental procedures were conducted on a Quinton treadmill. Each participant was required to complete nine of the eighteen conditions which were each four minutes in duration. Postural changes were assessed using lateral and posterior digital images taken at the second and fourth minute and compression and shearing forces were estimated with the ErgolmagerTM Physiological responses (heart rate, ventilation and metabolic responses) were measured continuously with the Quark b² and perceptual responses ('central' and 'local' RPE) were measured every minute during the experimentation and body discomfort was rated at the completion of each condition. Overall responses revealed that hand carriage (146 bt. <b>min⁻¹,</b> 25. 09 mIO₂. kg-l. <b>min⁻¹)</b> was generally found to be more physiologically stressful than backpack carriage (130 bt. <b>min⁻¹,</b> 22. 15 mIO₂. kg⁻¹. <b>min⁻¹)</b> independent of load mass and gradient. Physiological responses were higher (113 bt. min- 1 to 174 bt. <b>min⁻¹)</b> in responses to increasing gradient as opposed to increasing load mass (104 bt. min- 1 to 153 bt. <b>min⁻¹)</b> for both backpack and hand carriage. Categorisation using the guidelines of Sanders and McCormick (1993) allowed for classification of conditions, with respect to physiological responses, into 'moderate', 'heavy' and 'very heavy' stress. For almost all of the physiological responses the majority of conditions which were classified as 'moderate' were backpack carriage conditions and the conditions classified as 'very heavy' were mostly hand carriage conditions. In terms of postural responses hand carriage resulted in more strain and greater compression and shearing forces on the spine. In terms of the compression forces increasing gradient had a greater affect on backpack carriage (681 N to 935 N) compared to hand carriage (570 N to 793 N). In contrast, increasing load mass had a larger affect on hand carriage postures and compression forces (751 N to 935 N) in comparison to backpack carriage (723 N to 780 N). Shearing forces were found to be worse in hand carriage conditions overall. Although participants generally underrated perceived exertion in relation to cardiorespiratory responses, these perceptions revealed that backpack carriage, with a mean 'central' RPE of 12 compared to 11 for hand carriage, was somewhat preferred to hand carriage and that increasing gradient was perceived to be marginally more straining than increasing load mass.

40|$|Background: In South Africa, limited {{research}} has focused on the task demands and workers responses associated with forestry silviculture work, particularly pitting and planting. The methods currently in use are manual, but despite our lack of understanding of the existing demands, advances in forestry engineering have resulted in an introduction of semi-mechanised versions of these tasks. This project aimed to compare the task demands of silviculture tasks using the current manual techniques and the more modern, semi-mechanised techniques. Methods: A holistic investigation focused on the worker characteristics of a sample of black male pitters and black female planters from the Kwa-Zulu Natal forestry industry, as well as biomechanical (spinal kinematics and L 5 /S 1 forces), physiological (heart rate, oxygen consumption and energy expenditure) and psychophysical (ratings of perceived exertion and body discomfort) responses associated with manual and semi-mechanised pitting and planting. Results: The pitting task saw significant improvements in the spinal kinematic measures {{as a result of the}} increased mechanisation, with eight of the 16 recorded variables decreasing to a lower level of risk classification. Physiologically, the manual task was associated with a mean heart rate of 157 bt. <b>min⁻¹</b> and absolute energy expenditure of 11. 27 kcal. <b>min⁻¹,</b> which were not found to be significantly different to the values of 143 bt. <b>min⁻¹</b> and 9. 8 kcal. <b>min⁻¹</b> recorded during the semi-mechanised technique. Psychophysical responses indicated that the workers perceived manual pitting to be more physically demanding than the semi-mechanised method. The manual and semi-mechanised planting tasks were, in general, found to be acceptable from a spinal kinematics perspective, with the majority of variables classified as low risk. However, the maximum sagittal angle was reduced by more than 20 degrees as a result of the new equipment. The physiological and psychophysical demands associated with manual planting were found to be within acceptable limits. Conclusion: In terms of pitting, it can tentatively be concluded that the semi-mechanised technique is better than the manual one, based on the biomechanical and psychophysical findings, however physiological demands require further investigation. When considering the planting techniques, the semi-mechanised method showed a slight improvement from the biomechanical perspective, but further physiological and psychophysical investigations are needed...|$|E
40|$|We studied whether {{oxygen uptake}} from the {{surrounding}} water might enhance survival in submerged third instar larvae of Phaeoxantha klugii, a tiger beetle from the central Amazonian floodplains. Local oxygen partial pressures (Po₂) were measured with microcoaxial needle electrodes close to larvae submerged in initially air-saturated still water. The Po₂ profiles showed that the larvae exploit oxygen from the aquatic medium. Metabolism in the air of more or less resting larvae was determined by measuring the rate of CO₂ production (s(V) over dot CO₂) with an infrared gas analyzer at 29 degreesC. The s(V) over dot Co₂ was around 1. 8 μL g⁻¹ <b>min⁻¹,</b> equivalent to an oxygen consumption rate (s(V) over dot O₂) of 1. 8 - 2. 6 μL g⁻¹ <b>min⁻¹.</b> Oxygen consumption ((V) over dot O₂) of individually submerged larvae measured in closed respiration chambers at 19 - 10. 3 kPa Po₂ (initially air saturated, 29 degreesC) ranged between 0. 05 and 0. 2 μL <b>min⁻¹</b> and was not correlated with body mass. The s(V) over dot O₂ ranged between 0. 1 and 0. 4 μL <b>min⁻¹.</b> that is, 4 % - 22 % of the metabolic rate measured in air. Mean (V) over dot o₂ decreased with declining Po₂; however, some individuals showed contrary patterns. (V) over dot o(2) was additionally measured in dormant larvae, in larvae submerged for 1 - 2 d in open water or for 30 - 49 d within sediment, {{as well as in}} larvae exposed to anoxia before the measurements. The range of (V) over dot O₂ was similar in all groups, indicating that the larvae exploit oxygen from the water whenever available. Similar (V) over dot o₂ across the whole range of body mass investigated (0. 31 - 0. 76 g) suggests that oxygen uptake occurs by spiracular uptake. Assuming that larvae survive for some time at rates comparable to depressed metabolic rates reported for other insect species, it can be concluded that oxygen uptake from water can sustain aerobic metabolism even under quite severe hypoxia. It might therefore play an important role for survival during inundation periods...|$|E

40|$|Nitrate {{movement}} under simultaneous {{influence of}} hydraulic, electric and chemical gradients was investigated. A one-dimensional ion migration model {{was developed and}} compared with laboratory column experiments. Operation of subsurface drainage with an electrode was discussed as an application. The ion transport equation was developed utilizing non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Onsager's reciprocal relations were applied {{to reduce the number}} of linear phenomenological coefficients that relate flux to driving forces. Then phenomenological coefficients were expressed using known or measurable physical, chemical and electrical properties of solute and porous media. Developed equations were numerically solved by the Integral Finite Difference Method in one dimension. The numerical results were validated with analytical solutions of simple boundary conditions as well as the results obtained from laboratory column experiments for two or three applied gradients. Without water flow, nitrate concentration increased at the anode by 2. 5 times after 100 hrs of 30 V application. Three initial concentrations, 10, 100 and 500 ppm NO₃-N, were tested. A log normal relation between elapsed time and relative concentration increase at the anode was obtained. Two flux rates (0. 112 and 0. 225 cm <b>min⁻¹),</b> and three inflow concentrations (100, 500 and 1000 ppm NO₃-N) were used to evaluate nitrate transport in the column. Nitrate concentration at the anode increased by 10 to 20 % at the end of all experiments. However, the concentration in the column was same as inflow concentration. The application of electrokinetic nitrate removal by installed subsurface drainage with on-off (no flow then flush out) operation is recommended over a continuous flow approach. The numerical model results showed very low flux rates (i. e. 2. 68 x 10 ⁻³ cm <b>min⁻¹)</b> are required for nitrate accumulation in a sand column, and the experimental results confirmed no accumulation at a flux rate of 0. 112 cm <b>min⁻¹...</b>|$|E
40|$|The Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua, {{differs from}} many teleosts in that its heart {{does not respond}} to {{adrenergic}} stimulation, and is more capable of maintaining function during acute temperature changes. To examine if differences in intracellular calcium mobilization are associated with these atypical responses, confocal microscopy was used to study the calcium handling of cardiac cells from Atlantic cod vs. steelhead trout at their acclimation temperature (10 ºC), or subjected to acute temperature changes (to 4 and 16 ºC), while being stimulated {{across a range of}} frequencies (10 – 110 <b>min⁻¹).</b> In addition, cells were tested with and without tonic (10 nM) levels of adrenaline at 10 ºC, and pharmacological blockers were used to study the relative contributions of the L-type Ca²⁺ channel, sarcoplasmic reticulum and Na+/Ca²⁺ exchanger to the Ca²⁺ transient. Consistent with previous in vitro and in situ studies, there were few significant effects of adrenaline on the Ca²⁺ transient of cod cardiomyocytes, yet adrenaline had significant positive inotropic effects on trout cardiomyocytes. At 10 ºC, peak Ca²⁺ (F/F₀) only differed between the two species at low stimulation frequencies (10, 30 min- 1), with trout F/F₀ 25 - 35 % higher. In contrast, the time to peak Ca²⁺ and the time to half relaxation were both shorter (by 10 – 35 % across frequencies) in cod.

40|$|The ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) {{channel is}} {{a class of}} inward {{rectifier}} K+ channels that can link cellular metabolic status to vasomotor tone across the metabolic transients seen with exercise. This investigation tested the hypothesis that if KATP channels are crucial to exercise hyperaemia then blockade via glibenclamide (GLI) would lower hindlimb skeletal muscle blood flow (BF) and vascular conductance (VC) during treadmill exercise. In 14 adult male Sprague Dawley rats mean arterial pressure (MAP), blood [lactate], and hindlimb muscle BF (radiolabelled microspheres) were determined at rest (n = 6) or during exercise (n = 8; 20 m <b>min⁻¹,</b> 5 % incline) under control (CON) and GLI conditions (5 mg kg⁻¹, i. a). At rest and during exercise, MAP was higher (Rest, CON: 130 ± 6, GLI: 152 ± 8; Exercise, CON: 140 ± 4, GLI: 147 ± 4 mmHg, P < 0. 05) and heart rate (HR) was lower (Rest, CON: 440 ± 16, GLI: 410 ± 18; Exercise, CON: 560 ± 4, GLI: 540 ± 10 beats <b>min⁻¹,</b> P < 0. 05) with GLI. Hindlimb muscle BF (CON: 144 ± 10, GLI: 120 ± 9 ml <b>min⁻¹</b> (100 g) ⁻¹, P < 0. 05) and VC were lower with GLI during exercise but not at rest. Specifically, GLI decreased BF in 12, and VC in 16, of the 28 individual hindlimb muscles and muscle parts sampled during exercise with a greater fractional reduction present in muscles comprised predominantly of type I and type IIa fibres (P < 0. 05). Additionally, blood [lactate] (CON: 2. 0 ± 0. 3; GLI: 4. 1 ± 0. 9 mmol L⁻¹, P < 0. 05) was higher during exercise with GLI.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{robustness}} and the versatility of pressurized hot water extraction (PHWE) {{for a variety}} of analytes and matrices. Applications discussed include: selective extraction of alkaloids in goldenseal followed by their degradation studies; in-cell clean-up of pesticides in medicinal plants employing custom made molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) sorbents; in-cell pre-concentration followed by desorption of aflatoxins in plants with MIPs; desorption of pesticides from electrospun nanofiber sorbents; and removal of templates from MIPs sorbents. It was demonstrated that selective extractions could be achieved by just changing the temperature of water while adjusting the pressure. For instance, the alkaloids in goldenseal (hydrastine and berberine), were extracted at 140 °C, 50 bars, 1 mL <b>min⁻¹</b> in 15 min; organochlorine pesticides from medicinal plants were extracted at 260 °C, 80 bars, 1 mL min- 1 in 10 min; while aflatoxins AFG 2, AFG 1, AFB 2 and AFB 1 were extracted at 180 °C, 60 bars and a flow rate of 0. 5 mL <b>min⁻¹</b> in 10 min. The selectivity of PHWE was further enhanced by combining it with selective MIPs sorbents at higher temperatutes. In-cell clean-up of interfering chlorophyll was successfully removed from the medicinal plants during pesticides analysis while clean-up of aflatoxins AFG 2, AFG 1, AFB 2 and AFB 1 was achieved in two extraction cells connected in series. Ultrasound was also combined with PHWE for extraction of hydrastine and berberine at 80 °C and 40 bars in 30 min. PHWE was further evaluated for removal of templates from quercetin, phthalocynine and chlorophyll MIPs. The templates were thoroughly washed off their MIPs within 70 min with PHWE compared to over 8 h for Soxhlet and ultrasound assisted extraction. Pesticides were also desorbed from electrospun nanofibers at 260 °C, 80 bars in 10 min employing only water at 0. 5 mL <b>min⁻¹.</b> In the light of green chemistry, the decrease in the usage of organic solvents was 100 %, resulting in no organic solvent waste. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{physically}} small conical-tip carbon electrodes (~ 2 - 5 μm {{diameter and}} ~ 4 μm axial length) were hydrogenated {{to develop a}} probe capable of withstanding fouling during dopamine detection in vivo. Upon hydrogenation, the resultant hydrophobic sp³ carbon surface deters adsorption of amphiphilic lipids, proteins, and peptides present in extracellular fluid and hence minimizes electrode fouling. These hydrogenated carbon electrodes showed a 35 % decrease in sensitivity but little change {{in the limit of}} detection for dopamine over a 7 -day incubation in a synthetic laboratory solution containing 1. 0 % (v/v) caproic acid (a lipid), 0. 1 % (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0. 01 % (w/v) cytochrome C (both are proteins), and 0. 002 % (w/v) human fibrinopeptide B (a peptide). Subsequently, during dopamine detection in vivo, over 70 % of the dopamine oxidation current remained after the first 30 min of a 60 -min experiment, and at least 50 % remained over the next half-period at the hydrogenated carbon electrodes. On the basis of these results, an initial average electrode surface fouling rate of 1. 2 % <b>min⁻¹</b> was estimated, which gradually declined to 0. 7 % <b>min⁻¹.</b> These results support minimal fouling at hydrogenated carbon electrodes applied to dopamine detection in vivo. 8 page(s...|$|E

Most of these slowly exchanging protons could be associated with hydrogen bonds in secondary structure elements of the α-domain.

40|$|Physically small carbon {{electrodes}} were fabricated by pyrolyzing acetylene {{in a nitrogen atmosphere}} using pulled quartz capillaries as {{the supporting}} substrate. A carbon disk geometry was obtained when a parallel flow of acetylene (50 kPa) and nitrogen (10 mL <b>min⁻¹)</b> was {{introduced into the}} system. Further, carbon was found to deposit at the tip and on the shank of the quartz capillaries when the nitrogen flow rate was increased (80 mL <b>min⁻¹),</b> yielding an approximately cylindrical geometry. A series of electrochemical and spectroscopic analyses was carried out to examine the type of carbon surface obtained by pyrolysis of acetylene. The results suggested that a surface consisting of an almost defect-free highly oriented pyrolytic graphite type structure was formed by the pyrolyzed acetylene. However, this contradicts the kinetically reversible electron transfer observed for dopamine oxidation at these electrodes. Meanwhile, the nonpolar and relatively oxygen-free characteristics indicate that these electrodes also behave similarly to a hydrogenated carbon surface. The formation of a hydrogenated carbontype surface may be plausible {{as a result of the}} attack on the carbon surface by a surplus of hydrogen produced by the pyrolysis of acetylene to form graphitic carbon. These characteristics are expected to aid in reducing electrode fouling, which is often encountered in electrochemical detection of neurotransmitters in vivo. In conjunction with a miniature physical dimension, their appreciable surface area and enhanced mechanical strength make these carbon electrodes well suited to the detection of neurotransmitters in vivo. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Herein, {{we present}} an {{innovative}} approach to monitoring in situ drug release under dynamic flow conditions from aluminum implants featuring nanoporous anodic alumina (NAA) covers {{used as a}} model of drug-releasing implants. In this method, reflectometric interference spectroscopy (RIfS) is used to monitor in real-time the diffusion of drug from these nanoporous implants. The release process is carried out in a microfluidic device, which makes it possible to analyze drug release under dynamic flow conditions with constant refreshing of eluting medium. This setup mimics the physiological conditions of biological milieu at the implant site inside the host body. The release of a model drug, indomethacin, is established by measuring the optical thickness change with time under four different flow rates (i. e. 0, 10, 30, and 50 μL <b>min⁻¹).</b> The obtained data are fitted by a modified Higuchi model, confirming the diffusion-controlled release mechanism. The obtained release rate constants demonstrate that the drug release depends on the flow rate and the faster the flow rate the higher the drug release from the nanoporous covers. In particular, the rate constants increase from 2. 23 ± 0. 02 to 12. 47 ± 0. 04 μg min⁻¹/² when the flow rate is increased from 10 to 50 μL <b>min⁻¹,</b> respectively.

40|$|Experimental data on {{the rate}} of {{extraction}} of oil from rapeseed were collected on a bench scale batch extractor, using commercial hexane (Skelly F) as a solvent. The experimental data were then used to fit a two stage washing/diffusion mathematical model. The effects of variables such as particle thickness, extraction temperature, cooking, degree of agitation, change of total mass of seed and solvent, as well as, the seed to solvent ratio, on the rate of extraction were studied. The reason for examining so many variables in this project was {{to make certain that}} in general the mathematical model would be applicable to any operating condition of the extraction process, without any restrictions. The extraction process was found, indeed, to be the summation of two processes involving a washing and a diffusion process. The washing process was very rapid and took place in the early stage of the extraction in which the oil was removed {{from the surface of the}} crushed seeds. The diffusion process, however, was slow, took place in the latter stage of the extraction, and two mechanisms appeared to be involved; one slow and one very slow. The slow mechanism was responsible for the removal of a portion of oil which was held in the partially broken cells, whereas, the very slow mechanism was responsible for the removal of a portion of oil within the unruptured cells. Kinetic coefficients of both (cooked and uncooked) prepressed and flaked seed were obtained for the model and ranged from 0. 79 to 9. 35 <b>min⁻¹</b> for the washing stage, 0. 056 to 0. 38 <b>min⁻¹</b> for the unhindered diffusion stage, and 0. 0015 to 0. 01 6 <b>min⁻¹</b> for the hindered diffusion stage over the following range of conditions: particle size from 0. 76 mm to 0. 06 mm, solvent to seed ratio 0 of 4, agitation speed of 170 rpm and at the temperature of 40 °C. A reduction in particle thickness, an increase in temperature of extraction and heat treatment of the seed prior to extraction increased the rate of extraction. The rate of extraction also increased as a result of increasing the agitation speed of the stirrer and increasing the seed to solvent ratio.

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Halogenated {{monoterpene}} {{production by}} the red macroalga Octhodes secundiramea was studied-under different levels of nutrient, bromide, vanadium and light delivery. The key products formed were identified as myrcene, betaelemene, the Z and E isomers of l 0 -bromomyrcene, 3 -chloro- 10 E-bromomyrcene, Apakaocthodene A, and isomers of chloromyrcene and dibromomyrcene. The proposed pathway begins with an initial halogenation of myrcene to 3 - chloromyrcene or 10 -bromomyrcene. 10 -bromomyrcene reacts with either chloride or bromide ions producing either 3 -chloro- 10 E-bromomyrcene or 1, 10 - dibromomyrcene. The production of Apakaochtodene A starts from myrcene with 4 consecutive halogenation reactions, the first one forming the cyclic ring. All fermentations were carried out in similar 2 L photobioreactors. Temperature was controlled at 26 °C, with a photoperiod of 14 hours on: 10 hours off. Incident light intensity was 143 μE m⁻² s⁻¹ for nutrient, bromide and vanadium delivery cultivations and the mean light intensity was set to 52. 5, 125, and 240 μE m⁻² s⁻¹ for light delivery cultivations.

No apparent correlation {{was found between the}} response to sulfite and generation time in rich (YEPD) or minimal media. Resistant mutant 11 - 1 had an extended lag phase relative to wildtype. Mutant and wildtype proteins were labeled with ³⁵S-methionine to determine differences in banding patterns due to sulfite-specific induction or disappearance of polypeptides. No obvious differences following SDS-PAGE and autoradiography were observed upon induction with 0. 213 μM free H₂SO₃. No consistent correlations were found between the sulfite phenotypes and responses to other reducing agents.

40|$|The {{study of}} marine mammal {{energetics}} can {{shed light on}} how these animals might adapt to changing environments. Their physiological potential to adapt will be influenced by extrinsic factors, such as temperature, and by intrinsic factors, such as sex and reproduction. We measured the standard metabolic rate (SMR) {{of males and females}} of three Australian otariid species (two Australian fur seals, three New Zealand fur seals and seven Australian sea lions). Mean SMR ranged from 0. 47 to 1. 05 l O 2 <b>min⁻¹,</b> which when adjusted for mass was from 5. 33 to 7. 44 ml O 2 <b>min⁻¹</b> kg⁻¹. We found that Australian sea lion mass-specific SMR (sSMR; in millilitres of oxygen per minute per kilogram) varied little in response to time of year or moult, but was significantly influenced by sex and water temperature. Likewise, sSMR of Australian and New Zealand fur seals was also influenced by sex and water temperature, but also by time of year (pre-moult, moult or post-moult). During the moult, fur seals had significantly higher sSMR than at other times of the year, whereas there was no discernible effect of moult for sea lions. For both groups, females had higher sSMR than males, but sea lions and fur seals showed different responses to changes in water temperature. The sSMR of fur seals increased with increasing water temperature, whereas sSMR of sea lions decreased with increasing water temperature. There were no species differences when comparing animals of the same sex. Our study suggests that fur seals have more flexibility in their physiology than sea lions, perhaps implying that they will be more resilient in a changing environment. 14 page(s...|$|E

40|$|A {{distinctive}} {{property of}} the cerebellar system is olivocerebellar modules, where synchronized electrical activity in neurons in the inferior olivary nucleus (IO) evokes organized activity in the cerebellar cortex. However, the exact function of these modules, {{and how they are}} developed, is still largely unknown. Here we show that the IO in in vitro slices from postnatal mice spontaneously generates clusters of neurons with synchronous Ca²⁺ transients. Neurons in the principal olive (PO), and the vestibular-related dorsomedial cell column (dmcc), showed an age-dependent increase in spontaneous calcium transients. The spatiotemporal activity pattern was occasionally organized in clusters of co-active neighbouring neurons, with regular (16 <b>min⁻¹)</b> and irregular (2 – 3 <b>min⁻¹)</b> repeating cluster activity in the dmcc and PO, respectively. IO clusters had a diameter of 100 – 170 μm, lasted ~ 1 s, and increased in occurrence from postnatal day P 5. 5 to P 12. 5, followed by a sharp drop to near zero at P 15. 5. IO clusters were overlapping, and comprised nearly identical neurons at some time points, and a varied subset of neurons at others. Some neurons had hub-like properties, being co-active with many other neighbours, and some were co-active with separate clusters at different times. The coherence between calcium transients in IO neurons decreased with Euclidean distance between the cells reaching low values at 100 – 200 μm distances. Intracellular recordings from IO neurons during cluster formation revealed the presence of spikelet-like potentials, suggesting that electrical coupling between neighbouring IO neurons may serve as a synchronizing mechanism. In conclusion, the IO shows spontaneous cluster activity under in vitro conditions, coinciding with a critical postnatal period in olivocerebellar development. We propose that these clusters may be forerunners of the ensembles of IO neurons shown to be co-active in adult animals spontaneously and during motor acts...|$|E

Plasmodium falciparum is the most virulent of the malaria parasites and it delivers its deadliest impact during the erythrocytic stages of the parasite’s life cycle; a stage characterised by elevated catabolism of haemoglobin and anabolism of parasite proteins. The present study investigates the use of nanotechnology in the form of metallic silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) against P. falciparum leucine aminopeptidase (PfLAP), a validated biomedical target involved in haemoglobin metabolism. AgNPs were also tested against the human homolog cytosolic Homo sapiens leucine aminopeptidase (HsLAP) to ascertain their selective abilities. PfLAP and HsLAP were successfully expressed in Escherichia coli BL 21 (DE 3) cells. PfLAP showed optimal thermal stability at 25 °C and optimal pH stability at pH 8. 0 with a Km of 42. 7 mM towards leucine-p-nitroanilide (LpNA) and a Vmax of 59. 9 μmol. ml⁻¹. <b>min⁻¹.</b> HsLAP was optimally stable at 37 °C and at pH 7. 0 with a Km of 16. 7 mM and a Vmax of 17. 2 μmol. ml⁻¹. <b>min⁻¹.</b> Both enzymes exhibited optimal activity in the presence of 2 mM Mn²⁺.

With the use of available targeting techniques, the present study shows the potential use of nanotechnology based approaches as “silver bullets” that can target PfLAP without adversely affecting the host. However further research needs to be conducted to better understand the mechanisms of AgNP action, drug targeting and the health and safety issues associated with nanotechnology use...|$|E
