Effects of nonzero Mach number, variable ratios of upstream and downstream running waves, choice of location of the sensing pressure taps, and the incorrect spacings were examined numerically. Calculations were also made for steam flow where the <b>maximum</b> <b>Mach</b> <b>number</b> is much smaller than in cold air flows. For an industrial application where steam flow velocities are below 50 m/s, a very accurate sensor is shown to be possible. Experimental data were obtained by using an active aeroacoustic source over the range of 50 m/s to zero in an air flow. Experimental phase plots obtained from several coast-down tests have been compared with analytical results. The agreement with theory is excellent when the spacings are near N(lambda) / 2 and the sensing locations are near the pressure antinodes. Otherwise, some zero shifts are introduced.

Three of the turbulence models were algebraic models: Thomas (the standard algebraic turbulence model in PARC), Baldwin-Lomax, and Modified Mixing Length-Thomas (MMLT). The other two models were the low Reynolds number k-epsilon models of Chien and Speziale.

Since the thermodynamic region in which non-classical phenomena are physically admissible is finite {{in terms of}} pressure, density and temperature intervals, the intensity of RSWs is expected to exhibit a maximum for any given fluid. The identification of the operating conditions leading to the RSW with maximum intensity {{is of paramount importance}} for the experimental verification of the existence of non-classical phenomena in the vapour phase and for technical applications taking advantage of the peculiarities of the non-classical regime. This study investigates the conditions resulting in an RSW with maximum intensity in terms of pressure jump, wave <b>Mach</b> <b>number</b> and shock strength. The upstream state of the RSW with maximum pressure drop is found to be located along the double-sonic locus formed by the thermodynamic states associated with an RSW having both pre- and post-shock sonic conditions.
