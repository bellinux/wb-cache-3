5|$|In 1913, {{the school}} was {{accredited}} as a junior college by the North Central Association. Lindenwood received a $4 million bequest in 1918, the entire estate of the late Margaret Leggat Butler, wife of Colonel James Gay Butler, a Civil War veteran and philanthropist. The college used the funds to establish a permanent endowment and <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> two-year to a four-year curriculum.

5|$|Soon after recording, Dolph sent an acetate disc of the {{recordings}} to Columbia {{in an attempt}} to interest them in distributing the album, but they declined, as did Atlantic Records and Elektra Records—according to Morrison, Atlantic objected to the references to drugs in Reed's songs while Elektra disliked Cale's viola. Eventually, the MGM Records-owned Verve Records accepted {{the recordings}} with the help of Verve staff producer Tom Wilson, who had recently <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> job at Columbia.|$|E

5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, some Protestant Christians <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{position}} of allowing moderate {{use of alcohol}} (sometimes called moderationism) to either deciding that not imbibing was wisest in the present circumstances (abstentionism) or prohibiting all ordinary consumption of alcohol because it {{was believed to be}} a sin (prohibitionism). Many Protestant churches, particularly Methodists and Evangelical groups, advocated abstentionism and were early leaders in the temperance movement of the 19th and 20th centuries. Today, all three positions exist in Christianity, but the historic position remains the most common worldwide, due to the adherence by the largest bodies of Christians, namely Anglicanism, Roman Catholicism, and Eastern Orthodoxy.|$|E
5|$|Since 1965, George Harrison and his wife, Pattie Boyd, {{had lived}} in Kinfauns in Surrey, south of London. The house was a {{bungalow}} and too small to accommodate a home recording studio, so the couple began a year-long search for a larger property, concentrating on an area west of London encompassing the counties of Berkshire and Oxfordshire. In January 1970, Harrison purchased the 120-room Friar Park, set on 33 acres of land, just west of Henley-on-Thames. Previously the home of an order of Roman Catholic nuns, the Salesians of Don Bosco, the four-storey house and its grounds were in a dilapidated state, {{and it was not}} until the start of March that the Harrisons <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> worker's cottage and into the main residence.|$|E
5|$|The Embassy of the United States of America to Somalia was a {{diplomatic}} {{mission of the}} United States in Mogadishu, Somalia from 1960 to 1991. In 1957, the US opened a Consulate-General in Mogadishu—the capital of the Trust Territory of Somalia, a UN trusteeship under Italian administration. The consulate was upgraded to embassy status in July 1960, when the US recognized Somalia's independence and appointed an ambassador. The embassy served to counter Soviet influence during the Cold War and {{also served as a}} base for the United States Agency for International Development, which had a large presence in the country. In 1989, the embassy <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> dilapidated building in central Mogadishu to a new compound {{on the outskirts of the}} city.|$|E

25|$|Fluid {{particles}} are subject only to pressure {{and their own}} weight. If a fluid is flowing horizontally and along a section of a streamline, where the speed increases {{it can only be}} because the fluid on that section has <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> region of higher pressure to a region of lower pressure; and if its speed decreases, it can only be because it has <b>moved</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> region of lower pressure to a region of higher pressure. Consequently, within a fluid flowing horizontally, the highest speed occurs where the pressure is lowest, and the lowest speed occurs where the pressure is highest.|$|E
