25|$|If all the ligands are <b>monodentate,</b> {{then the}} number of donor atoms equals {{the number of}} ligands. For example, the cobalt(II) hexahydrate ion or the hexaaquacobalt(II) ion 2+ is a hydrated-complex ion that {{consists}} of six water molecules attached to a metal ion Co. The oxidation state and the coordination number reflect the number of bonds formed between the metal ion and the ligands in the complex ion. However, the coordination number of Pt(en) is 4 (rather than 2) since it has two bidentate ligands, which contain four donor atoms in total.|$|E
25|$|The {{trivalent}} lanthanides mostly form ionic salts. The trivalent ions {{are hard}} acceptors and form more stable complexes with oxygen-donor ligands than with nitrogen-donor ligands. The larger ions are 9-coordinate in aqueous solution, 3+ but the smaller ions are 8-coordinate, 3+. There {{is some evidence}} that the later lanthanides have more water molecules in the second coordination sphere. Complexation with <b>monodentate</b> ligands is generally weak because it is difficult to displace water molecules from the first coordination sphere. Stronger complexes are formed with chelating ligands because of the chelate effect, such as the tetra-anion derived from 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA).|$|E
500|$|Most Cr(I) {{compounds}} {{are obtained}} by oxidation of electron-rich, octahedral Cr(0) complexes. Other Cr(I) complexes contain cyclopentadienyl ligands. [...] As verified by X-ray diffraction, a Cr-Cr quintuple bond (length 183.51(4) pm) {{has also been}} described. Extremely bulky <b>monodentate</b> ligands stabilize this compound by shielding the quintuple bond from further reactions.|$|E
2500|$|... 1,2-Bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (dppe) is a {{commonly}} used bidentate ligand in coordination chemistry. Dppe is almost invariably chelating, {{although there are}} examples of <b>monodentate</b> (e.g., W(CO)5(dppe)) and of bridging behavior.|$|E
2500|$|Multiple {{occurring}} <b>monodentate</b> ligands {{receive a}} prefix {{according to the}} number of occurrences: di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, or hexa. [...] Polydentate ligands (e.g., ethylenediamine, oxalate) receive bis-, tris-, tetrakis-, etc.|$|E

In (...) the bidentate ligand is replaced by two <b>monodentate</b> methylamine ligands of approximately the same donor power, meaning that the enthalpy of formation of Cu—N bonds is approximately the same in the two reactions.|$|E
2500|$|Sulfur dioxide {{can bind to}} metal ions as a ligand to form metal {{sulfur dioxide}} complexes, {{typically}} where the transition metal is in oxidation state 0 or +1. [...] Many different bonding modes (geometries) are recognized, but in most cases, the ligand is <b>monodentate,</b> attached to the metal through sulfur, which can be either planar and pyramidal η1.|$|E
2500|$|Monophosphine-type ligands {{were among}} the first to appear in {{asymmetric}} hydrogenation, e.g., the ligand CAMP. [...] Continued research into these types of ligands has explored both P-alkyl and P-heteroatom bonded ligands, with P-heteroatom ligands like the phosphites and phosphoramidites generally achieving more impressive results. Structural classes of ligands that have been successful include those based on the binapthyl structure of MonoPHOS [...] or the spiro ring system of SiPHOS. [...] Notably, these <b>monodentate</b> ligands can be used in combination with each other to achieve a synergistic improvement in enantioselectivity; something that is not possible with the diphosphine ligands.|$|E
2500|$|The ligand forms a chelate complex {{with the}} substrate. Chelate {{complexes}} are contrasted with coordination complexes composed of <b>monodentate</b> ligands, which form only one {{bond with the}} central atom. The word chelation is derived from Greek χηλή, chēlē, meaning [...] "claw"; the ligands lie around the central atom like the claws of a lobster. The term chelate was first applied in 1920 by Sir Gilbert T. Morgan and H. D. K. Drew, who stated: [...] "The adjective chelate, derived from the great claw or chele (Greek) of the lobster or other crustaceans, is suggested for the caliperlike groups which function as two associating units and fasten to the central atom so as to produce heterocyclic rings." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{enthalpy}} {{should be}} {{approximately the same}} for the two reactions, {{the difference between the two}} stability constants is due to the effects of entropy. In equation (...) there are two particles on the left and one on the right, whereas in equation (...) there are three particles on the left and one on the right. This difference means that less entropy of disorder is lost when the chelate complex is formed than when the complex with <b>monodentate</b> ligands is formed. This is one of the factors contributing to the entropy difference. Other factors include solvation changes and ring formation. Some experimental data to illustrate the effect are shown in the following table.|$|E

5000|$|Consider the two equilibria, in aqueous solution, {{between the}} copper(II) ion, Cu2+ and {{ethylenediamine}} (en) {{on the one}} hand and methylamine, MeNH2 on the other.In [...] the bidentate ligand ethylene diamine forms a chelate complex with the copper ion. Chelation results in the formation of a five-membered ring. In [...] the bidentate ligand is replaced by two <b>monodentate</b> methylamine ligands of approximately the same donor power, meaning that the enthalpy of formation of Cu-N bonds is approximately the same in the two reactions. Under conditions of equal copper concentrations and when then concentration of methylamine is twice the concentration of ethylenediamine, the concentration of the complex [...] will be greater than the concentration of the complex [...] The effect increases with the number of chelate rings so the concentration of the EDTA complex, which has six chelate rings, is much higher than a corresponding complex with two <b>monodentate</b> nitrogen donor ligands and four <b>monodentate</b> carboxylate ligands. Thus, the phenomenon of the chelate effect is a firmly established empirical fact: under comparable conditions, the concentration of a chelate complex will be higher than the concentration of an analogous complex with <b>monodentate</b> ligands.|$|E

50|$|Diphenyl-2-pyridylphosphine is an organophosphorus {{compound}} with the formula P(C6H5)2(2-C5H4N). It {{is the most}} widely used mono-pyridylphosphine ligand. Other mono-pyridylphosphines ligands (3-, 4-) are not common in chemical literature; however, tris-pyridylphosphines have been thoroughly investigated as ligands in transition metal complexes used for catalysis. Pyridylphosphines, including diphenyl-2-pyridylphosphine, may bind transition metals as <b>monodentate</b> or bidentate ligands4. Diphenyl-2-pyridylphosphine behaves as a P-bound <b>monodentate</b> ligand, or a P,N-bound bidentate ligand. Diphenyl-2-pyridylphosphine is a sought after ligand for its ability to relay protons to transition metals such as palladium(II) in homogeneous catalysis.|$|E

50|$|In most {{coordination}} polymers, a ligand (atom {{or group}} of atoms) will formally donate a {{lone pair of electrons}} to a metal cation and form a coordination complex via a Lewis acid/ base relationship (Lewis acids and bases). Coordination polymers are formed when a ligand has the ability to form multiple coordination bonds and act as a bridge between multiple metal centers. Ligands that can form one coordination bond are referred to as <b>monodentate,</b> but those which form multiple coordination bonds, which could lead to coordination polymers are called polydentate. Polydentate ligands are particularly important because it is through ligands that connect multiple metal centers together that an infinite array is formed. Polydentate ligands can also form multiple bonds to the same metal (which is called chelation). <b>Monodentate</b> ligands are also referred to as terminal because they do not offer a place for the network to continue. Often, coordination polymers will consist of a combination of poly- and <b>monodentate,</b> bridging, chelating, and terminal ligands.|$|E
