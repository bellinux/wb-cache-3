The method {{of this study was}} Classroom Action Research (CAR) consisting of planning, observing, acting, and reflecting phases. There were two cycles needed in implementing EL to the twenty one EFL learners as the participants. The results revealed that each subcompetence in cycle I and cycle II was achieved in the following score: planning & preparation for learning (<b>Mean</b> <b>in</b> cycle I= 2, 8; <b>Mean</b> <b>in</b> cycle II= 3, 38), classroom management (<b>Mean</b> <b>in</b> cycle I= 2, 5; <b>Mean</b> <b>in</b> cycle II= 2, 95), delivery of instruction (<b>Mean</b> <b>in</b> cycle I= 2, 6; <b>Mean</b> <b>in</b> cycle II= 2, 90), and monitoring, assessment, and follow-up (<b>Mean</b> <b>in</b> cycle I= 2, 4; <b>Mean</b> <b>in</b> cycle II= 2, 95).

5|$|Most of {{the capital}} used by Glazer to {{purchase}} Manchester United {{came in the form}} of loans, the majority of which were secured against the club's assets, incurring interest payments of over £60million per annum. The remainder {{came in the form of}} PIK loans (payment in kind loans), which were later sold to hedge funds. Manchester United was not liable for the PIKs, which were held by Red Football Joint Venture and were secured on that company's shares in Red Football (and thus the club). The interest on the PIKs rolled up at 14.25% per annum. Despite this, the Glazers did not pay down any of the PIK loans in the first five years they owned the club. In January 2010, the club carried out a successful £500million bond issue, and by March 2010, the PIKs stood at around £207million. The PIKs were eventually paid off in November 2010 by unspecified <b>means.</b> <b>In</b> August 2012, as part of further refinancing, the Glazers sold a number of shares in Manchester United in an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).|$|E

5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid (Aphis fabae) {{is a small}} black insect in the Aphis genus, with a broad, soft body, {{a member of the}} order Hemiptera. Other common names include blackfly, bean aphid and beet leaf aphid. In the warmer months of the year it is found in large numbers on the undersides of leaves and on the growing tips of host plants, {{including}} various agricultural crops and many wild and ornamental plants. Both winged and wingless forms exist and at this time of year, they are all females. They suck sap from stems and leaves and cause distortion of the shoots, stunted plants, reduced yield and spoiled crops. This aphid also acts as a vector for viruses that cause plant disease and the honeydew it secretes may encourage the growth of sooty mould. It breeds profusely by live birth but its numbers are kept in check, especially in the later part of the summer, by various predatory and parasitic insects. Ants feed on the honeydew it produces and take active steps to remove the aphid's enemies. It is a widely distributed pest of agricultural crops and can be controlled by chemical or biological <b>means.</b> <b>In</b> the autumn, winged forms move to different host plants where both males and females are produced. These mate and the females lay eggs which overwinter.|$|E
