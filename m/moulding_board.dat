40|$|A {{field study}} was {{conducted}} during May - July, 2015 on loamy sand soil at the Agronomy Farm of Eastern University to compare the effect of different tillage practices on soil saturated hydraulic conductivity at 10 cm depth. The experiment was arranged in a split plot design with three replications where two types of tillage implements (<b>mould</b> <b>board</b> plough and rotovator) were assigned as main plot factors and the speed of operation of the implements such as 0. 45, 0. 65 and 0. 85 m/s as sub plot factors. The treatment combinations were randomly distributed in each block, {{resulting in a total}} of 18 plots. Soil saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured using Guelph permeameter. The rate of fall of the water level in the reservoir was observed at 1 minute interval. One set of steady flow rate measurements was made at a constant pressure head of 5 cm water. The hydraulic conductivities were then calculated using “Guelph Permeameter Calculator” spreadsheet. Greatest hydraulic conductivity was obtained with rotovator than <b>mould</b> <b>board</b> plough due to the achieved lower bulk densities and higher porosity with rotovator. It has been documented that higher hydraulic conductivity under shallow tillage than under <b>mould</b> <b>board</b> ploughing is due to stable macro pores. Thus, the variation in size and number of macro pores in each tillage system has caused greater hydraulic conductivity values with rotovator than with <b>mould</b> <b>board</b> plough. Furthermore, inversive tillage with <b>mould</b> <b>board</b> plough made the aggregates unstable during wetting that could cause lower hydraulic conductivities. After four weeks of tillage, hydraulic conductivity was found to be decreased with increase in bulk density due to soil compaction as the hydraulic properties of soils are affected by soil compaction. The statistical analysis revealed that the tillage implements had a significant effect on hydraulic conductivity, but the operating speed did not have any significant impact on hydraulic conductivity at P < 0. 05. The tillage with rotovator treatments enhanced favorable soil conditions, which facilitated increased hydraulic conductivity of 9. 06 mm/h. The tillage plots with <b>mould</b> <b>board</b> plough resulted in lower hydraulic conductivities. Therefore, under the soil and weather conditions of this experiment, the better tillage practice identified for improved soil hydraulic property is tillage with rotovator...|$|R

This research was examined for studying the influences of tillage systems on the three cotton cultivars at Karkandeh and Hashm-Abad stations in Gorgan. The experiments were conducted in a randomized completely block design as split plot with three replications with five tillage systems (<b>Mould</b> <b>board</b> plough, Chisel, Disc, Strip and no tillage) as main plot and three cultivars (Siokra 324, Zodrac-Motagenez and Cindoz 80) as sup-plot. The results showed that effects of tillage system was significant on yield. Yield was more in chisel and disk (Conservation tillage) by having more monopodial branch length, number of monopodial and sympodial branch, plant height and boll in plant than <b>Mould</b> <b>board</b> plough (conventional tillage) and no-tillage system in all cultivars. The Siokra 324 cultivar had more yield due to having more boll in plant than two other cultivars. Yield in no-tillage system was lower than conservation and conventional tillage but the grown plants in this system were smaller and had lower branching. Thus population density can be increased for gaining higher yield from this system, and it is recommended to do complete experiments for studying the effects of various population densities in no tillage system and conservation tillage with the conclusive studies are replaced conventional tillage...|$|R

25|$|The early Middle Ages, {{from the}} fifth century to the tenth century, were a period of climate deterioration, with a drop in {{temperature}} {{and an increase in}} rainfall, resulting in more land becoming unproductive. With a lack of significant transport links and wider markets, most farms had to produce a self-sufficient diet of meat, dairy products and cereals, supplemented by hunter-gathering. Limited archaeological evidence indicates that farming was based around a single homestead or a small cluster of three or four homes, each probably containing a nuclear family, with kinship relationships likely to be common among neighbouring houses and settlements, reflecting the partition of land through inheritance. The climate meant that more oats and barley were grown than wheat. The evidence of bones indicates that cattle were by far the most important domesticated animal, followed by pigs, sheep and goats, while domesticated fowl were very rare. Christian missionaries from Ireland may have changed agricultural practice, bringing innovations such as the horizontal water mill and <b>mould</b> <b>board</b> ploughs, which were more effective in turning the soil.|$|R

For accurate determination of tensile strength and stiffness of coir fibre, its density (¿coir = 1. 2 ¿ 1. 3 g/cm 3) and cross-sectional area were determined. Both thickness and longitudinal swelling of the fibre were measured to assess the effects of water absorption. The constituent fibre and pith fractions of coconut husk have been chemically analysed for polysaccharide (cellulose, pectin and hemicellulose) and lignin contents. Detailed carbohydrate analysis of the fibre indicated a glucose (cellulose) content of approximately 33 % in the cell wall, together with 12 % xylose as the major component of the hemicellulose fraction. Coir pith only contains 16 % glucose. The effects of maturing on the chemical composition of the husk is analysed and a significant increase in glucose (cellulose) is observed, while for other sugars no dramatic change in relative amounts can be measured.

To reduce these negative effects of tillage and fertilizers when growing winter rape, the possibility to establish Winter rape by direct drilling into growing ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) or white clover (Trifolium repens L.) was evaluated in a field experiment at Lönnstorp, Skåne. On a morainic clay loam, autumn <b>mould</b> <b>board</b> ploughing followed by conventional seedbed preparation and sowing was compared with direct drilling into barley stubble, and with direct drilling into the growing catch crop, previously established in spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Throughout the experiment, 48 cm row spacing was used for the rape. The tillage treatments were combined with nitrogen fertilizer strategies, with or without 40 kg N ha- 1 in autumn at establishment. Where nitrogen was added in the autumn, the amount of fertilizer added in spring was reduced with the same amount. In spring, only the treatments without a catch crop were inter-row weeded because of too vigorously developed ryegrass and white clover, and weeding was therefore not possible to carry out in these treatments. Direct drilling of winter rape was successful compared to conventional tillage, even though the mean root neck diameter of oil seed rape in November was small and the over-wintering was poor There was no yield of oil seed rape when it was sown into growing ryegrass due to poor establishment of the rape and poor overwintering.

Nitrogen as subplot treatment (0, 40, 80, 120 and 160 kg ha- 1) was applied in two splits, half at 15 and the other half at 45 days after sowing with uniform cultural practices for crop growth and development. Compared to year 1, crop of year 2 showed better phenology with extended life cycle (LC). On two years average across tillage and N treatments, biological yield did not change (p< 0. 05) under the residue but did report lower at no-residue treatment. Nonetheless, grain yield showed a significant (p< 0. 05) change with the highest in legume followed by cereal and the lowest in no-residue treatments. A non-significant tiller number and significant variations in grain weight and spike m- 2 were observed that influenced the grain and biological yield differently. Deep than shallow tillage resulted in better traits, which returned better biomass and grain yield.

However, agricultural plants environment in the organic field characterized by physical, chemical and biological properties which different from intensive farming options. These conditions should {{be reflected in the}} selection of appropriate technological operations, which in turn fit into certain limitations. Research on the adaptation of the basic crop cultivation technologies to the requirements of organic production is carried out in IAEP. For that purpose we developed a model of perspective technical and technological provision of organic farmers. The model considers a set of organic crop rotation, and for each crop of which the corresponding organic technology used. Technical means are selected from the general list contained in the model, {{depending on the size of}} the farm and the selected level of crop productivity. Economic and environment indicators are also calculated. Particular attention of the model is drawn to the following group operations: mechanical tillage, application of organic fertilizers, weed and pest control. Generally, organic farmers use ordinary technical means, but the model also considers promising. We use tillage system with different depths for organic crop rotation: cereal crops - at depth of 12 - 16 cm, for vegetable crops and potatoes at depth of 22 - 24 cm by <b>mould</b> <b>board</b> plough. In the presence of strongly marked "subsoil layer" or waterproof horizon the subsoil shattering is conducted to a depth of 45 cm by chisel cultivator. Fall tillage is an effective way to control weeds, diseases and pests. Promising is the use of technical means for the local application of solid manure in the furrow. A particularly important task in organic agriculture is weed control. In addition to crop rotation, the cultivation of root crops used ridge system and previously developed and then half-forgotten, rotary harrows to handle the ridge slopes during the growing season. Such rotary harrows were very effective for weed control in potatoes field experiment in 2016. Following operations: seeds cover by biological drugs; biological drugs application during seeding and on plants during vegetations, are including in technologies for organic control of deceases and pests. As a promising area is consider to use one of the physical methods for the precise removal of weeds. Also, the idea of precision agriculture can be used for imaging of a disease or pest on vegetation and accurate extermination on the small patch by biological drugs. The model of promising technical and technological provision of organic farm can be transformed into a software system that will be useful for agricultural producers engaged in organic crop production, as well as organizations providing their technical means...|$|R
40|$|Influence of extractives on {{mould growth}} on Scots pine sapwood dried in air or in kiln was studied. Boards were sprayed with water {{mixtures}} of spores of the fungal species Penicillium sp., Aspergillus sp., Mucor sp., Paecilomyces sp., Trichoderma sp., treated at {{a temperature of}} 22 ºC at 90 % RH, classified into a percentage of covered area. Acetone and water extracts were isolated and analyzed for sugars, nitrogen, ash, resin/fatty acids, glycerol, and phenols. A multivariate Orthogonal Partial Least Squares (OPLS) regression model was developed to study relations between the extent of <b>mould</b> coverage of <b>boards</b> and chemical content. The model describes 51 % variability in X and 69 % in Y with prediction power of 55 %. The results indicated that total acetone soluble extractives and sugars like glucose contributed to increased mould growth whereas fatty acids prevent mould growth...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural {{intensification}} has {{a strong}} impact on level of soil organic matter (SOM), microbial biomass stocks and microbial community structure in agro-ecosystems. The size of the microbial necromass C pool could be about 40 {{times that of the}} living microbial biomass C pool in soils. Due to the specificity, amino sugar analysis gives more important information on the relative contribution of fungal and bacterial residues to C sequestration potential of soils. Meanwhile, the relationship between microbial biomass and microbial necromass in soil and its ecological significance on SOM are not fully understood and likely to be very complex in grassland soils. This thesis focuses on the effects of tillage, grassland conversion intensities and fertilisation on microbial biomass, residues and community structure. The combined analyses of microbial biomass and residue formation of both fungi and bacteria provided a unique opportunity to study the effect of tillage, grassland conversion and fertilisation on soil microbial dynamics. In top soil at 0 - 30 cm layer, a reduction in tillage intensity by the GRT and NT treatments increased the accumulation of saprotrophic fungi in comparison with the MBT treatment. In contrast, the GRT and NT treatments promoted AMF at the expense of saprotrophic fungi in the bottom soil layer at 30 - 40 cm depth. The negative relationship between the ergosterol to microbial biomass C ratio and the fungal C to bacterial C ratio points to the importance of the relationship between saprotrophic fungi and biotrophic AMF for tillage-induced changes in microbial turnover of SOC. One-season cultivation of winter wheat with two tillage events led to a significant loss in SOC and microbial biomass C stocks at 0 - 40 cm depth in comparison with the permanent grassland, even 5 years after the tillage event. However, the tillage induced loss in microbial biomass C was roughly 40 % less in the long-term than in the short-term of the current experiment, indicating a recovery process during grassland restoration. In general, <b>mould</b> <b>board</b> tillage and grassland conversion to maize monoculture promoted saprotrophic fungi at the expense of biotrophic AMF and bacteria compared to undisturbed grassland soils. Slurry application promoted bacterial residues as indicated by the decreases in both, the ergosterol to microbial biomass C ratio and the fungal C to bacterial C ratio. In addition, the lost microbial functional diversity due to tillage and maize monoculture was restored by slurry application both in arable and grassland soils. I conclude that the microbial biomass C/S ratio can be used as an additional indicator for a shift in microbial community. The strong relationships between microbial biomass and necromass indices points to the importance of saprotrophic fungi and biotrophic AMF for agricultural management induced effects on microbial turnover and ecosystem C storage. Quantitative information on exact biomass estimates of these two important fungal groups in soil is inevitably necessary to understand their different roles in SOM dynamics.

40|$|International audienceThe cork {{industry}} produces high {{amounts of}} cork powders {{resulting from the}} final stages of cork processing or resulting from existing cork products. Usually these powders are burned and served to boilers in industrial processes. The main goal of this work is to transform this cork sub-product into a highly value composite product. The real value is dependent on the mechanical performance of this product. Thus the mixture between cork and thermoplastics, particularly the improvement of interfacial bonding, is an important topic, which needs to be developed. The interfacial affinity can be greatly increased, applying superficial modification of one of the components, or by the use of coupling agents. In this work, a high amount of cork powder (50 wt. %) from different origins combined with different thermoplastic materials using melt based processes has been examined. Pultrusion was used to produce pellets and compression <b>moulding</b> to obtain <b>boards</b> to determine its properties. Coupling agents based on maleic anhydride (2 wt. %) improved the tensile strength successfully, while the cork powder has an a important role in the stiffness. The morphology of the surface fractures indicated a good dispersion of the cork and a good adhesion between both phases. Thermal properties of the composites disclosed a nucleating effect promoted by cork...|$|R
