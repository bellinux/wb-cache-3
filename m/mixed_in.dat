40|$|Language is {{the most}} {{effective}} tool of communication. It is not a simply means of communicating information but also a very important means of establishing and maintaining relationship with other people. In this era, more people can use more than one language in their communication in order to be accepted by society. It happens because they are bilinguals who can speak and understand more than one language. One of the features of becoming bilingual is code mixing. Code mixing is the change of one language to another within the same utterance or in same oral/written text. This study was aimed to get answer of the research problems, namely (1) What are the Indonesian-English code <b>mixing</b> found <b>in</b> the novel My Stupid Boss by Chaos@work? (2) What are the forms of code <b>mixing</b> found <b>in</b> the novel My Stupid Boss by Chaos@work? The objective of this research is to find out the Indonesian-English code <b>mixing</b> used <b>in</b> the novel My Stupid Boss. Besides, it is also intended to know the forms of code <b>mixing</b> found <b>in</b> the novel My Stupid Boss. The design of this research was descriptive qualitative. The instrument used was the researcher himself as the key human instrument. The findings of research showed that there were 148 code mixing used.

In conclusion, the writer used some forms of code mixing, such as: code <b>mixing</b> <b>in</b> word, phrase, hybrid, repetition word, and clause. There was no code <b>mixing</b> <b>in</b> the form of idiom because the characters always mixed their language spontaneously by using simple language in every conversation, so they did not use idiom which sometimes difficult to understand by different people...|$|R

40|$|The mapping {{method has}} proven its {{efficiency}} as an analysis and optimization tool for <b>mixing</b> <b>in</b> many different flow devices. In this paper, {{we present a}} new approach to compute the coefficients of the distribution matrix, which is, both in terms of computational speed and complexity, more easy to implement as compared to the original approach developed in our group. The new approach is of the same accuracy as the original approach as is demonstrated by studying <b>mixing</b> <b>in</b> the standard two-dimensional cavity flow. The power of the new approach is that it can easily be implemented to analyze <b>mixing</b> <b>in</b> complex geometries where the original approach fails. This is demonstrated by analyzing <b>mixing</b> <b>in</b> a static Sulzer SMX mixer. To enhance the availability of the mapping method for general users of CFD in commercial packages like Fluent, CFX, Star CD, etc., we finally add an example of an implementation of the new approach in Matlab, applying it to study <b>mixing</b> <b>in</b> a time periodic sine flow (TPSF). © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
