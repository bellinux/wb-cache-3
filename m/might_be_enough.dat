5|$|The Conference of Nyon was {{arranged}} in September 1937 for all parties with a Mediterranean coastline by the British, despite appeals by Italy and Germany that the Committee handle the piracy {{and other issues}} the conference was to discuss. It decided that French and British fleets patrol the areas of sea west of Malta, and attack any suspicious submarines. Warships that attacked neutral shipping would be attacked. On 18 September, Juan Negrín requested that the League of Nations' Political Committee examine Spain. He also demanded an end to non intervention. Eden claimed that non-intervention had stopped European war. The League did report on the Spanish situation, noting the 'failure of non-intervention'. On 6 November, the Committee met once again, with the plan to recognise the Nationalists as belligerents once significant progress had been made was finally accepted, down in part to Eden's patience. The Nationalists accepted on 20 November, the Republicans on 1 December. The former suggested 3,000 would be a reasonable number; this was, in reality the number of sick and unreliable Italians Franco wished to withdraw. This was countered by British suggestions fifteen or twenty thousand <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough.</b> These talks were subsumed by bilateral Anglo-Italian discussions. In trying to protect non-intervention in the Anglo-Italian meetings, which he grudgingly did, Eden would end up resigning from his post in the Foreign Office. On 17 March 1938, France reopened the border to arms traffic to the now weakened Republic. Between mid-April and mid-June, 21 British seamen were killed by attacks on British shipping in Spanish waters, {{as well as several}} Non-Intervention Committee observers.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{discussed}} that robots with similar characteristics to invalid carriages (e.g. 10mph maximum, limited battery life) might be a workaround for certain classes of applications. If the robot was sufficiently intelligent and able to recharge itself using existing electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure it would only need minimal supervision and a single arm with low dexterity <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to enable this function if its visual systems had enough resolution.|$|E
25|$|The mere {{expectation}} or rumor of {{a central}} bank foreign exchange intervention <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to stabilize a currency. However, aggressive intervention might be used several times each year in countries with a dirty float currency regime. Central banks do not always achieve their objectives. The combined resources of the market can easily overwhelm any central bank. Several scenarios of this nature were seen in the 1992–93 European Exchange Rate Mechanism collapse, and in more recent times in Asia.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, the {{scientist}} Nicholas E. Scott-Samuel and colleagues presented evidence using moving patterns {{on a computer}} that human perception of speed is distorted by dazzle patterns. However, the speeds required for motion dazzle are much larger than were available to First World War ships: Scott-Samuel notes that the targets in the experiment would correspond to a dazzle-patterned Land Rover vehicle at a range of , travelling at [...] If such a dazzling target causes a 7% confusion in the observed speed, a rocket propelled grenade travelling that distance in half a second would strike [...] from the intended aiming point, or 7% of the distance moved by the target. This <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to save lives in the dazzle-patterned vehicle, and perhaps to cause the missile to miss entirely.|$|E

500|$|Streisand's {{version of}} [...] "Guava Jelly" [...] divided music critics. A writer for Billboard was {{enthusiastic}} of the release, writing, [...] "Barbra takes the great Bob Marley reggae cut and commercializes it somewhat, though the flavor is still there. Good soulful backup and reggae type organ help make this an almost certain bet for heavy top 40 play". Author Derek Winnert referred to Streisand's version as a [...] "success" [...] in his 1996 book Barbra Streisand. However, an editor for Boating disliked Streisand's version and urged {{the public to}} [...] "ignore" [...] it, joking that it [...] "does not belong in [...] our stateroom". A reviewer from Broadcasting disliked everything about her version, stating, [...] "The Streisand voice and name alone <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to make a hit out of any of her single releases, but with the first single from her best-selling ButterFly album, the singer is taking no chances." ...|$|E
500|$|However, in {{the light}} of the bad {{publicity}} surrounding Madonna and her then husband Sean Penn, coupled with the fact that their drama film Shanghai Surprise had failed commercially, she had to fight hard to persuade Warner Bros. to green light the project. She also wanted her close friend James Foley to direct the film, proclaiming him to be a [...] "genius". Foley had previously directed the music videos of her songs [...] "Live to Tell", [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] and [...] "True Blue". Warner Bros. were looking for another way to cash in upon Madonna's success with soundtracks, and felt that her name alone <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to guarantee the success of the film as well as its soundtrack. So they felt that they had no choice, but to green light the project. Filming began in October 1986, in New York, but it was not until January that Madonna started working on the soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|Neil Geinzlinger of The New York Times {{wrote that}} [...] "it may not {{stay in the}} public eye long because this movie is {{probably}} not going to put up Twilight-like numbers," [...] adding that [...] "the script doesn't give them enough of the witty lines that can elevate these types of movies to must-see status, which is odd, since the producers include Will Ferrell." [...] Vince Horiuchi of The Salt Lake Tribune suggested that this film should have been made 30 years ago by Sam Raimi and starring Bruce Campbell, while instead [...] "the Hansel and Gretel we’re left with runs out of its magic potion far too early to let us enjoy its wicked possibilities." [...] A more positive comparison to Raimi and Campbell's Army of Darkness was made by Pete Vonder Haar of the Houston Press, who gave it three out of five [...] "witch hazels" [...] and wrote: [...] "I'm not sure if witches are the next vampires/zombies, or if the hinted-at franchise potential has any legs, but this was a perfectly vulgar way to spend 90 minutes." [...] Tim Grierson of Screen International wrote that Hansel and Gretel [...] "works best as an unapologetic B-movie action flick" [...] and [...] "feels like a first film in a franchise that’s meant to set up the main characters and conflicts, which can then be fleshed out in sequels" [...] but [...] "the problem is that there isn't enough here to warrant a return trip to this semi-magical land." [...] Richard Corliss of TIME agreed with this sentiment, stating that [...] "one <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> — too much, for some tastes." ...|$|E

Exit polls in previous states showed that all three groups {{were a part of}} Clinton's base. In mid-February, Clinton held a 10-point lead in Texas and a 20-point lead in Ohio in RealClearPolitics polling averages. The Clinton campaign set its sights on the Ohio-Texas [...] "firewall," [...] counting on a clear March 4 win to change the narrative and turn around her campaign for the nomination. Meanwhile, Obama hoped to score a win in one or both states that <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> to knock Clinton out of the race. By February 25, they were in a statistical dead heat in Texas, according to a CNN poll.|$|E

The Midrash answered, {{so that there}} <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> for a minyan of righteous people to pray {{on behalf of all}} of the people of Sodom. Alternatively, the Midrash said, because at the {{generation}} of the Flood, eight righteous people remained (in Noah and his family) and God did not give the world respite for their sake. Alternatively, the Midrash said, because Lot thought that there were ten righteous people in Sodom — namely Lot, his wife, his four daughters, and his four sons-in-law (but Lot was apparently mistaken in thinking them righteous). Rabbi Judah the son of Rabbi Simon and Rabbi Hanin in Rabbi Johanan's name said that ten were required for Sodom, but for Jerusalem even one would have sufficed, as [...] says, [...] "Run to and fro in the streets of Jerusalem... and seek... {{if you can find a}} man, if there be any who does justly... and I will pardon her." [...] And thus [...] says, [...] "Adding one thing to another, to find out the account." [...] Rabbi Isaac explained that an account can be extended as far as one man for one city. And thus if one righteous person can be found in a city, it can be saved in the merit of that righteous person.|$|E
