40|$|Abstract—Selective-area {{germanium}} (Ge) {{layer on}} silicon (Si) is desired {{to realize the}} advanced Ge devices integrated with Si very-large-scale-integration (VLSI) components. We demon-strate the area-dependent high-quality Ge growth on Si sub-strate through SiO 2 windows. The combination of area-dependent growth and multistep deposition/hydrogen annealing cycles has effectively reduced the surface roughness and the threading dislo-cation density. Low root-mean-square surface roughness of 0. 6 nm is confirmed by atomic-force-microscope analysis. Low defect den-sity in the area-dependent grown Ge layer is measured to be as low as 1 × 107 cm− 2 by plan-view transmission-electron-miscroscope analysis. In addition, the excellent metal–semiconductor–metal photodiode characteristics are shown on the grown Ge layer {{to open up a}} possibility to merge Ge optoelectronics with Si VLSI.

40|$|Abstract — The {{performance}} of a device based on modified injection-locking techniques is studied by means of numerical simulations. The device incorporates master and slave config-urations, each one with a DFB laser and an electroabsortion modulator (EAM). This arrangement allows the generation of high peak power, narrow optical pulses according to a periodic or pseudorandom bit stream provided by a current signal generator. The device is able to considerably increase the modulation band-width of free-running gain-switched semiconductor lasers using multiplexing in the time domain. Opportunities for integration in small packages or single chips are discussed.

With an optimized fabrication process employing low-temperature plasma enhanced {{chemical vapour deposition}} (PECVD) and reactive ion etching (RIE), propagation losses of 0. 86 dB/cm were achieved at λ= 850 nm for wire waveguides with {{a cross section of}} 600 x 250 nm 2. As an example of application we show Mach-Zehnder interferometer based label-free optical detection of the S-protein/S-peptide interaction.

40|$|<b>Monolithic</b> {{integration}} of <b>optoelectronics</b> on silicon is adream. This thesis {{deals with the}} studies on the heteroepitaxyof indium phosphide on silicon substrate towards making thatdream come true. Materials growth issues, characterization anddefect identification are addressed. Epitaxial lateral overgrowth (ELOG) technique is used togrow high quality epitaxial indium phosphide on a siliconsubstrate provided with a low quality indium phosphide seedlayer. Hydride vapor phase epitaxy is used for ELOG. The growthparameters were optimized first by carrying out ELOGexperiments on an InP substrate. The lateral growth rate isstrongly dependent on {{the orientation of the}} openings,thehighest growth rate being for the openings oriented at 30 ºand 60 º off [110]directions. But the vertical growth rateis relatively unaffected by the opening orientation. Theobservation of an inhomogeneous and orientation dependentdopant distribution within the same layer has been explained byinvoking the bonding configurations exposed to theincorporating dopant atoms in the different emergingplanes. When ELOG of InP is conducted on InP/Si, unlike that on InPsubstrates, the lateral growth is not symmetric on both sidesdue to the propagation of defects from the seed layer. Forexample, a higher concentration of threading dislocationsintersecting the surface of the { 111 }A emerging planes wouldcause a higher growth rate of these planes. The growth rate of{ 111 }A planes with respect to the others can also be caused bythe vapor phase supersaturation as predicated byBurton-Cabrera-Frank model. The determined dislocation densityin the ELOG InP on InP/Si is ~ 4 X 107 cm- 2, which is nearly two magnitude lower than in theseed layer (~ 4 X 109 cm- 2). If the seed layer is of a better quality, theELOG layer will also be. Combination of high resolution x-raydiffraction reciprocal lattice mapping and low temperaturephotoluminescence indicates that the ELOG InP layer with highaspect ratio is nearly strain-free. When ELOG of sulfur doped InP is conducted on ring shapedopenings on InP/Si substrate instead of stripe openings,octahedral shaped ELOG InP templates with smooth surface areformed. Strain compensated InGaAsP 6 periods multi-quantumwells (MQW) at 1. 5 μm wavelength (target value) were grownon these templates by metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy. RT-PLis indicative of a good quality ELOG layers. Optimized ELOG onring openings may become very attractive for heteroepitaxy ofIII-V compounds on silicon. As an extension of ELOG of InP on InP/Si, growth of InP isalso conducted on planar Focused-Ion-Beam (FIB) -modified (001) GaAs substrate. The impacts of the III/V ratio,crystallographic orientation of implanted lines andimplantation dose were explored. The choice of suitable growthconditions makes it possible to obtain continuous InP wiresaligned in all possible directions. NR 2014080...|$|R
