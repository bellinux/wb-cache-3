5|$|Orkney has {{significant}} wind and <b>marine</b> <b>energy</b> resources, {{and renewable energy}} has recently come into prominence. Although Orkney {{is connected to the}} mainland, it generates over 100% of its net power from renewables. This comes mainly from wind turbines situated right across Orkney.|$|E
5|$|The sea {{offers a}} very large supply of energy carried by ocean waves, tides, {{salinity}} differences, and ocean temperature differences which can be harnessed to generate electricity. Forms of 'green' <b>marine</b> <b>energy</b> include tidal power, marine current power, osmotic power, ocean thermal energy and wave power.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Mainland, most of the islands are in two groups, the North and South Isles, {{all of which have}} an underlying geological base of Old Red Sandstone. The climate is mild and the soils are extremely fertile, most of the land being farmed. Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy. The significant wind and <b>marine</b> <b>energy</b> resources are of growing importance, and the island generates more than its total yearly electricity demand using renewables. The local people are known as Orcadians and have a distinctive dialect of Scots and a rich inheritance of folklore. There is an abundance of marine and avian wildlife.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the islands}} have a bedrock formed from Old Red Sandstone, which is about 400 million years old, and was laid down in the Devonian period. The islands have good {{agricultural}} qualities and have been continuously inhabited for thousands of years, {{as evidenced by the}} World Heritage Site of the Heart of Neolithic Orkney. The archipelago is exposed to wind and tide, and there are numerous lighthouses as an aid to navigation. The European <b>Marine</b> <b>Energy</b> Centre, which is located at Stromness, is currently testing various wave and tidal energy devices from Billia Croo on the Mainland and Eday. The islands all fall within the Orkney Islands Council area. Most of the larger islands have development trusts that support the local economy.|$|E
25|$|The term <b>marine</b> <b>energy</b> {{encompasses}} both {{wave power}} i.e. power from surface waves, and tidal power i.e. {{obtained from the}} kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water.

25|$|<b>Marine</b> <b>energy</b> (also {{sometimes}} referred to as ocean energy) refers to the energy carried by ocean waves, tides, salinity, and ocean temperature differences. The movement of water in the world's oceans creates a vast store of kinetic energy, or energy in motion. This energy can be harnessed to generate electricity to power homes, transport and industries. The term <b>marine</b> <b>energy</b> encompasses both wave powerpower from surface waves, and tidal powerobtained from the kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water. Reverse electrodialysis (RED) is a technology for generating electricity by mixing fresh river water and salty sea water in large power cells designed for this purpose; as of 2016 it is being tested at a small scale (50 kW). Offshore wind power is not a form of <b>marine</b> <b>energy,</b> as wind power is derived from the wind, even if the wind turbines are placed over water. The oceans have a tremendous amount of energy and are close to many if not most concentrated populations. Ocean energy has the potential of providing a substantial amount of new renewable energy around the world.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} {{back-to-back}} 2 L- 3 L grid connection topology for a <b>marine</b> current <b>energy</b> converter. A prototype <b>marine</b> current <b>energy</b> converter has been deployed by a research group at Uppsala University.

The proposed grid connection system utilizes a well known and proven two level voltage source converter generator-side combined with a three-level cascaded H-bridge (CHB) multilevel converter grid-side. The multilevel converter brings benefits in terms of efficiency, power quality and DC-link utilization. The system is here presented for a single <b>marine</b> current <b>energy</b> converter but can easily be scaled up for clusters of <b>marine</b> current <b>energy</b> converters.

40|$|This is an {{investigation}} into the impact of Marine Conservation Zones on <b>marine</b> renewable <b>energy</b> deployment in UK waters. UK <b>marine</b> renewable <b>energy</b> industry stakeholders were sampled and their opinions, collected via interview and questionnaire, were analysed {{in the context of the}} state of the art literature. The sample consisted of two representatives of The Crown Estate, the Programme Director of Regensw and an anonymous project manager from a tidal stream turbine company. Discussion focuses on the effectiveness of UK Government policy at facilitating the sustainable development of a <b>marine</b> renewable <b>energy</b> industry and also, the feasibility of co-locating <b>marine</b> renewable <b>energy</b> and <b>Marine</b> Conservation Zones, as a mitigation strategy for reducing stakeholder conflicts and pressure on the surrounding marine environment. The analysis concludes that the designation of Marine Conservation Zones will have an impact on the deployment of MRE in UK waters. The most profound of these being increasingly costly and onerous monitoring and mitigation requirements for infrastructure projects situated close to, or within, planned or designated Marine Conservation Zones. Additionally, it was established that greater funding need be made available to the emerging UK <b>marine</b> renewable <b>energy</b> industry by Government, so as to appropriately reflect the support widely proclaimed in the policy language. Finally, the research concludes that co-location could be a management strategy in the future. However, until a greater understanding of the environmental impacts of <b>marine</b> renewable <b>energy</b> is gained, a precautionary approach should be adopted so as not to jeopardise the conservation objectives of the protective designation.
