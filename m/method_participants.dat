25|$|There are {{two basic}} {{experimental}} methods used to conduct cued recall, the study-test method and the anticipation method. In the study-test <b>method</b> <b>participants</b> study a list of word pairs presented individually. Immediately after or after a time delay, participants are tested in the study phase of the experiment on the word pairs just previously studied. One word of each pair is presented in a random order and the participant is asked to recall the item with which it was originally paired. The participant can be tested for either forward recall, Ai {{is presented as a}} cue for Bi, or backward recall, Bi is presented as a cue for Ai. In the anticipation <b>method,</b> <b>participants</b> are shown Ai and are asked to anticipate the word paired with it, Bi. If the participant cannot recall the word, the answer is revealed. During an experiment using the anticipation method, the list of words is repeated until a certain percentage of Bi words are recalled.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{method of}} {{measuring}} sleep in humans is polysomnography (PSG). [...] For this <b>method,</b> <b>participants</b> often must {{come into a}} lab where researchers can use PSG to measure things such as total sleep time, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, and sleep fragmentation. [...] PSG can monitor various body functions including brain activity (electroencephalography), eye movement (electrooculography), muscle movement (electromyography), and heart rhythm (electrocardiography).|$|E

30|$|Participant {{observation}} {{was also}} used during fieldwork. Although a broad research <b>method,</b> <b>participant</b> observation allows for improved context-specific understanding and provides a richness of detail that compliments other data. For this research, participant observation involved keeping a detailed journal that recorded visual and verbal observations, details of the informal discussions, conceptual diagrams, and newspaper stories (Özerdem and Bowd 2009; Ray-Bennett 2009; Vo 2015).|$|R
50|$|Using the {{discrete}} testing <b>method,</b> <b>participants</b> {{are shown}} symbols individually usually {{on a computer}} screen. In discrete RAN testing each individual symbols' naming latency is measured. The naming latency consists of the mean time from presentation to articulation of symbol. It is scored using the mean naming latency of all symbols. Some theorists believe that discrete RAN testing reflects the retrieval of phonological code from memory which can also {{be referred to as}} lexical access speed.|$|E
50|$|Using {{a serial}} testing <b>method,</b> <b>participants</b> are shown a row or column of symbols and must name the symbols {{sequentially}} {{as fast as}} possible. An assumption made of serial RAN testing is that it consists of two components: articulation time (the mean {{time it takes to}} articulate the symbol), and pause time (the mean length of time between naming two adjacent symbols). When referring to pause time, this can include saccadic eye movements, disengagement from previously named symbols and focusing on upcoming symbols.|$|E
50|$|In the {{exhaustive}} recall <b>method,</b> <b>participants</b> {{are asked}} to record all the memories they can access before a specific age. This method, like free recall, relies on participants {{to come up with}} memories without cues. Exhaustive recall yields a better understanding than others on the amount of memories surviving from early childhood, but can be demanding for the subjects who often have to spend many hours trying to remember events from their childhood. No major differences among word cued, interview, focused and exhaustive recall have been found.|$|E

5000|$|Support for the Differentiator Model is mixed, perhaps {{reflecting}} {{the paucity of}} studies designed to test the model itself or record SR over both limbs of intoxication. Both oral and intravenous alcohol administration studies reported that FH+ subjects experienced elevated sensitivity to stimulating effects of alcohol along rising BAC, without the corresponding attenuation of sedative effects as BAC fell. A study using an intravenous alcohol clamping <b>method</b> (<b>participants</b> were titrated to a BAC of [...]06 g/dl whereupon alcohol was infused to maintain a stable BAC {{for the duration of}} the study) reported that FH+ subjects experienced heightened stimulation on the ascending limb of intoxication, consistent with the Differentiator Model. However, FH+ subjects reported decreased stimulation during clamping, indicative of acute tolerance.|$|E
5000|$|Physical {{posture and}} emotion {{have been studied}} using two similar techniques. The first method {{involves}} the participant viewing videotaped actors performing certain actions and the second method involves having the participant sit in a certain posture and then self-reporting their emotions. In the first method, actors portray and record certain body movements. Participants must view the video and decipher the emotion they believe is being portrayed. [...] In the second <b>method,</b> <b>participants</b> are told to assume a certain body posture and then must complete a survey on their current affective state. Other methods include using neuroscience techniques, such as fMRI's to determine how posture and emotions expressions can affect brain imaging. Another method that is growing in use involves using dancers as 'actors' and having participants observe and determine the emotion the dancer is conveying.|$|E
