25|$|The RCMP on October 23 {{released}} security video showing Zehaf-Bibeau's movements {{across the}} Parliament Hill precinct. They also announced that Zehaf-Bibeau {{was not one}} of 93 suspected extremists on a RCMP high-risk traveller list, though email written by Zehaf-Bibeau had been found on a computer belonging to an unnamed individual charged with terrorism offences. At this meeting, RCMP Commissioner Paulson said Zehaf-Bibeau's <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> the RCMP that {{he wanted to go to}} Syria, but she denied this, stating that, in a recorded interview, she had told the RCMP that he had wanted to go to Saudi Arabia.|$|E
25|$|A legend arose that James {{had been}} warned against invading England by supernatural powers. While he was praying in St Michael's Kirk at Linlithgow, a man strangely dressed in blue had {{approached}} his desk saying his <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> him to say James should {{not to go to}} war or take the advice of women. Then before the King could reply, the man vanished. David Lindsay of the Mount and John Inglis could find no trace of him. The historian R. L. Mackie wondered if the incident really happened as a masquerade orchestrated by an anti-war party: Norman Macdougall doubts if there was a significant anti-war faction. Three other portents of disaster were described by Paolo Giovio in 1549 and repeated in John Polemon's 1578 account of the battle. When James was in council at the camp at Flodden Edge a hare ran out of his tent and escaped the weapons of his knights; it was found that mice had gnawed away the strings and buckle of the King's helmet; and in the morning his tent was spreckled with a bloody dew.|$|E
25|$|Ebadi {{has also}} defended various child abuse cases, {{including}} {{the case of}} Arian Golshani, a child who was abused for years and then beaten to death by her father and stepbrother. This case gained international attention and caused controversy in Iran. Ebadi used this case to highlight Iran’s problematic child custody laws, whereby custody of children in divorce is usually given to the father, even {{in the case of}} Arian, where her <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> the court that the father was abusive and had begged for custody of her daughter. Ebadi also handled the case of Leila, a teenage girl who was gang-raped and murdered. Leila’s family became homeless trying to cover the costs of the execution of the perpetrators owed to the government, because in the Islamic Republic of Iran, it is the victim's family's responsibility to pay to restore their honor when a girl is raped by paying the government to execute the perpetrator. Ebadi was not able to achieve a victory in this case, but she brought international attention to this problematic law. Ebadi also handled a few cases dealing with bans of periodicals (including the cases of Habibollah Peyman, Abbas Marufi, and Faraj Sarkouhi). She has also established two non-governmental organizations in Iran with western funding, the Society for Protecting the Rights of the Child (SPRC) (1994) and the Defenders of Human Rights Center (DHRC) in 2001.|$|E

500|$|As {{soon as the}} {{documentary}} aired, the Santa Barbara county attorney's office began a criminal investigation. After an initial probe from the LAPD and DCFS was conducted in February 2003, they had initially concluded that molestation allegations were [...] "unfounded" [...] at the time. After the young boy involved in {{the documentary}} and his <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> investigators that Jackson had behaved improperly, Jackson was arrested in November 2003 and charged with seven counts of child molestation and two counts of administering an intoxicating agent {{in relation to the}} 13-year-old boy shown in the film. Jackson denied the allegations, saying the sleepovers were not sexual in nature. The People v. Jackson trial began on January 31, 2005, in Santa Maria, California, and lasted until the end of May. On June 13, 2005, Jackson was acquitted on all counts. After the trial, in a highly publicized relocation, he moved to the Persian Gulf island of Bahrain as a guest of Sheikh Abdullah. Unknown to Jackson, Bahrain was also where the family had intended to send Jackson if he had been convicted, according to a statement by Jermaine Jackson printed in The Times of London in September 2011.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{contains}} {{a number of}} other cultural references. When Peter and Lois enter their motel room and find a hooker on the bed, Peter warns Lois to stay perfectly still, as the prostitute's vision is based on movement. This is a reference to a scene in the movie Jurassic Park (1993) in which Dr. Grant gives this warning in reference to a Tyrannosaurus Rex. Pinocchio appears in a cutaway gag, in which Gepetto bends over and deliberately sets Pinocchio up to tell a lie in an attempt to emulate anal sex. This was based on a joke MacFarlane's <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> her friends when he was a child. Lois yells out George Clooney's name when she and Peter are having sex. The 1950s sitcom The Honeymooners is also referenced when a fictional episode of the sitcom is shown in which Ralph Kramden, the show's main character, hits his wife, Alice, something he would only threaten to do on the show. Meg watches an episode of the CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men, which shows three men in a living room, one of whom is cut in half at the waist and screaming in agony, the other two standing over him and screaming in horror. Fictional army soldier Flint of [...] appears briefly after Chris is caught drinking vodka, and educates the children on drinking and informs them that [...] "...knowing is half the battle". Flint's voice was provided by Bill Ratner, the actor who had voiced the character in the G.I. Joe television series. According to Seth Green, who voices Chris, the reason the Family Guy cast members did not voice Flint themselves is because if you have the original actor providing the voice [...] "you take it with a little bit more gravitas".|$|E
2500|$|Afterward, it was {{revealed}} that although Poplawski's <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> the 9-1-1 operator that Poplawski owned guns, the operator typed [...] "no weapons" [...] on her report, relaying the information to the police dispatcher. When the operator asked Ms. Poplawski if her son had weapons, she responded yes, and stated that they were all legal. When asked to confirm that she was not being threatened with the guns, Ms. Poplawski did not answer, instead repeating that she wanted her son out of the house. Management in the Allegheny County response center contend that the dispatcher meant to relay that no weapons were involved in the dispute. The county's Chief for Emergency Services stated that the 9-1-1 operator had been on the job for less than a year, including training, and was placed on administrative leave and offered counseling.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2013 {{relatives}} of [...] "Jestyn" [...] gave interviews {{to the television}} current affairs program 60 Minutes. Kate Thomson, the daughter of Jessica and Prosper Thomson, said {{that her mother was}} the woman interviewed by the police and that her <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> her she (Jessica) had lied to them – Jessica did know the identity of the [...] "Somerton Man" [...] and his identity was also [...] "known to a level higher than the police force". Her father had died in 1995 and mother had died in 2007. Kate Thomson suggested that her mother and the [...] "Somerton Man" [...] may both have been spies, noting that Jessica Thomson taught English to migrants, was interested in communism, and could speak Russian, although she would not disclose to her daughter where she had learned it, or why.|$|E
2500|$|McCartney {{said he had}} {{the idea}} of [...] "Let It Be" [...] after he had a dream about his mother during the tense period {{surrounding}} the sessions for The Beatles ("the White Album") in 1968. According to McCartney, the song's reference to [...] "Mother Mary" [...] was not biblical. [...] The phrase has at times {{been used as a}} reference to the Virgin Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ. Nevertheless, McCartney explained that his mother – who died of cancer when he was fourteen – was the inspiration for the [...] "Mother Mary" [...] lyric. He later said: [...] "It was great to visit with her again. I felt very blessed to have that dream. So that got me writing 'Let It Be'." [...] He also said in a later interview about the dream that his <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> him, [...] "It will be all right, just let it be." [...] When asked if the song referred to the Virgin Mary, McCartney has typically answered the question by assuring his fans that they can interpret the song however they like.|$|E

'And we {{know more}} than that,' resumed the first, 'for she told us often, long ago, that the young <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> her that, feeling she should never get over it, {{she was on her}} way, at the time that she was taken ill, to die near the grave of the father of the child.' ...|$|E
