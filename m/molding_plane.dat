50|$|In late 2009, {{officials}} at Oakland County International Airport in Waterford, Michigan claimed Newton owed the airport more than $60,000 for unpaid parking fees, which they claimed he owed after having abandoned a $2 million Fokker F28 plane there {{more than three}} years before. The plane was originally flown in for renovations in 2005. After they were completed in 2007 the plane was moved to an outside parking area. The monthly parking fees were $5,000. An aircraft of this type needs to have its engines run {{at least once a month}} to retain its airworthiness.

5000|$|The {{company was}} formed May 1, 2003 [...] by general manager Charlie Hua. Hua, {{an expert in}} the field of {{information}} technology as well as an avid RC pilot, approached the design and manufacturing of his models from a market research viewpoint by determining the strengths and weaknesses in the ARF aircraft market, both foam and more traditional balsa/covering models. After determining that there was too much competition in the balsa market, Hua turned his attention to injection molded foam even over laser-cut foam for more consistent quality and the ability to create more complex shapes than would be possible with either laser cut or balsa. Injection <b>molded</b> foam <b>planes</b> of this type are also resistant to crash damage and are easily repaired after hard landings and minor crashes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{weight of}} platens {{accounts}} for about 70 % of the entire clamping device of injection molding machine. The reduction in the weight of platen means {{the reduction in the}} cost of injection molding machine. UG NX 8. 0 was adopted to conduct the parametric design, and UG NX 8. 0 “Advanced Simulation ” module was adopted to conduct the finite element analysis and the topology optimization design for the front platen of injection molding machine so as to obtain the quantitative conclusions that the volume of platen is reduced and the stiffness as well as the strength is improved. The maximum deformation of platen is decreased by 6. 2 %, the volume is decreased by 6 %, the maximum stress is decreased by 6. 6 % and the average displacement of all the nodes in the <b>mold</b> mounting <b>plane</b> is decreased by 9. 1 %. The effect of optimization is obvious...|$|R

The samples were made of two species of Paulownia (Paulownia elongata and Paulownia fortunei). All the samples were processed by <b>planing</b> (<b>molding).</b> After molding, the samples were arranged in groups and sanded. In relation with wood grain direction, each group had a particular system of sanding, based on the numbering of sanding paper, program of displacement of sanding papers with different numbering and the direction of sanding. The quality of wood surface after sanding was expressed by the values of roughness parameters in the system 'M': Ra, Rz, Rv, Rp and Rt. The contact angle was measured using transparent polyurethane (PU) coating and distilled water. The influence {{of the system of}} sanding on the values of contact angle was analyzed by roughness parameter Ra...|$|R
40|$|A linear {{perturbation}} method {{is used to}} examine the stability of a unidirectional solidification problem in which a liquid, initially at the melting temperature, becomes solidified by heat transfer across a pressure-dependent thermal contact resistance to a <b>plane</b> <b>mold.</b> The contact pressure will be influenced by thermal distortion in response to the instantaneous temperature field in the solidified shell. The heat transfer and thermal stress problems are therefore coupled through the boundary conditions. The temperature and stress fields are assumed to consist of a unidirectional component and a small spatially-sinusoidal perturbation which can vary with time. Analysis of the thermoelastic problem for the solidified shell leads to an ordinary differential equation relating the perturbation in heat flux at the mold/casting interface and the corresponding perturbation in contact pressure. A second equation relating the same two variables is obtained by linear perturbation of the relation for heat conduction across the thermal contact resistance. These are then reduced to a single equation which is solved numerically. The results show that a small initial perturbation will grow substantially during the solidification process if the thermal contact resistance is very sensitive to pressure...|$|R
40|$|A linear {{perturbation}} method {{is used to}} solve two-dimensional heat conduction problem in which a liquid becomes solidified by heat transfer to a <b>plane</b> <b>mold</b> of finite thickness. Heat flux drawn from the lower surface of the mold is approximately uniform, but contains a small sinusoidal perturbation in one space dimension. Numerical results are obtained for the consequent sinusoidal perturbation in the solid/melt boundary {{as a function of}} time. Analytical results are obtained for the limiting case in which diffusivities of the solidified shell and the mold materials are infinitely large. These results are then compared with the numerical predictions to establish the validity of the model and the numerical approach. The results document the effects of both solidified shell and the mold material diffusivities on the growth of a perturbation in a nominally plane solidification front. It is demonstrated that the magnitude of this perturbation increases with the diffusivity of the mold, and this effect of mold diffusivity is overweighed by the diffusivity of the casting material. The influence of other process parameters such as the mold thickness, thermal contact resistance at the mold-shell interface, and thermal conductivity ratio on the growth of solidified shell thickness is also investigated in detail.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{a path to}} hitherto unachievable differential photometric precisions from the ground, both in the optical and near-infrared (NIR), using custom-fabricated beam-shaping diffusers produced using specialized nanofabrication techniques. Such diffusers <b>mold</b> the focal <b>plane</b> image of a star into a broad and stable top-hat shape, minimizing photometric errors due to non-uniform pixel response, atmospheric seeing effects, imperfect guiding, and telescope-induced variable aberrations seen in defocusing. This PSF reshaping significantly increases the achievable dynamic range of our observations, increasing our observing efficiency and thus better averages over scintillation. Diffusers work in both collimated and converging beams. We present diffuser-assisted optical observations demonstrating 62 (- 16) (+ 26) ppm precision in 30 minute bins on a nearby bright star 16 Cygni A (V = 5. 95) using the ARC 3. 5 m telescope-within a factor of similar to 2 of Kepler's photometric precision on the same star. We also show a transit of WASP- 85 -Ab (V = 11. 2) and TRES- 3 b (V = 12. 4), where the residuals bin down to 180 (- 41) (+ 66) ppm in 30 minute bins for WASP- 85 -Ab-a factor of similar to 4 of the precision achieved by the K 2 mission on this target-and to 101 ppm for TRES- 3 b. In the NIR, where diffusers may provide even more significant improvements over {{the current state of}} the art, our preliminary tests demonstrated 137 (- 36) (+ 64) ppm precision for a K-S = 10. 8 star on the 200 inch. Hale Telescope. These photometric precisions match or surpass the expected photometric precisions of TESS for the same magnitude range. This technology is inexpensive, scalable, easily adaptable, and can have an important and immediate impact on the observations of transits and secondary eclipses of exoplanets...|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} {{dedicated}} {{to one of the}} most important and urgent tasks in mechanical engineering development - the creation of low-density and environmentally-friendly thermoinsulation from available cheap basalt fibers for products to operate at temperatures up to 700 °C. One of the most effective applications of such thermo-insulation is to develop and provide highly porous coatings from short basalt fibers by liquid filtration for tubing (T) to supply superheated up to 420 ° C steam under pressure of 35 MPa in the deep layers with severe highviscosity oil. Tubing with the short low-density basalt insulation can be used for a greater depth than the vacuum-insulated tubing, which are also called "thermo-cases", and do not fully meet business needs for long-term reliability of oil vacuum tubes, too large mass per unit length of their design and, as a consequence, the impossibility to use such pipes for deep wells. The aim of the work is to simulate a liquid filtration process of short fibers and determine technological parameters of producing thermal insulation coatings of tubing pipes from basalt fibers and mineral binder shaped as cylinders and cylindrical shells. The paper proposes a mathematical model of free filtration deposition of short fibers from liquid slurry, which describes dynamics of creating thermal insulation products and allows us to determine the rational parameters of their manufacturing process. It shows methods to improve the products quality while forming the thermal insulation by filtration through additional vacuum deposition of a filtrate chamber and the final prepressing of sediment layer, giving dimensions and shape to the final product. The paper defines a prescription hydro mass composition. It shows that to increase the compressive strength of highly fibrous rings and cylindrical shells it is necessary to use based on oxide А 12 O 3 5 - 7 % by weight mineral binder, which fixes basalt fibers in places of their contacts. It is proved that in order to reduce a manufacturing time of long-length cylindrical shells from short basalt fibers by liquid filtration it is necessary to use the scheme of their <b>molding</b> from a <b>plane</b> of the cylinder element. Taking into account the thermal characteristics of basalt fibers and highly porous structure of the thermal insulation on the received samples are determined the real porosity, density of material and the thickness of the tubing pipe coatings. </p...|$|R
