40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} an open channel flume with a flat sandy bed to examine the role of turbulence on sediment resuspension. An acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) {{was used to measure}} the instantaneous three-dimensional velocity components and acoustic backscatter as a proxy to suspended sediment concentration. Estimates of sediment transport assume that there is a <b>mean</b> <b>critical</b> <b>velocity</b> that needs to be exceeded before sediment transport is initiated. This approach does not consider the turbulent flow field that may initiate sediment resuspension through event-based processes such as the “bursting” phenomenon. In this paper, laboratory measurements were used to examine the sediment resuspension processes below and above the <b>mean</b> <b>critical</b> <b>velocity.</b> The results within a range above and below the measured <b>mean</b> <b>critical</b> <b>velocity</b> suggested that (1) the contribution of turbulent bursting events remained identical in both experimental conditions, (2) ejection and sweep events contributed more to the total sediment flux than up-acceleration and down-deceleration events, and (3) wavelet transform revealed a correlation between the momentum and sediment flux in both test conditions. Such similarities in conditions above and below the measured <b>mean</b> <b>critical</b> <b>velocity</b> highlight the need to re-evaluate the accuracy of a single time-averaged <b>mean</b> <b>critical</b> <b>velocity</b> for the initiation of sediment entrainment...|$|E
