40|$|The {{multichannel}} {{cochlear implant}} is the first neural prosthesis to effectively and safely bring electronic technology into a direct physiological relation with {{the central nervous system}} and human consciousness. It is also the first cochlear implant to give speech understanding {{to tens of thousands of}} persons with profound deafness and spoken language to children born deaf in more than 80 countries. In so doing, it is the first major advance in research and technology to help deaf children communicate since Sign Language of the Deaf was developed at the Paris deaf school (L'Institut National de Jeunes Sourds de Paris) > 200 years ago. Furthermore, biomedical research has been fundamental for ensuring that the <b>multielectrode</b> <b>implant</b> is safe as well as effective. More recent research has also shown that bilateral implants confer the benefits of binaural hearing. Future research using nanotechnology should see high-fidelity sound received, which would help deaf persons communicate in noise and enjoy music.

It also allows increased recording longevity (5 consecutive years) and recording of a broad range of behaviors, such as social interactions, and BMI paradigms in freely moving primates. We propose that wireless large-scale recordings could have a profound impact on basic primate neurophysiology research while providing a framework for the development and testing of clinically relevant neuroprostheses.

The primary {{purpose of this article is}} to provide an overview of contemporary cochlear implants from the perspective of two designers of implant systems. That perspective includes the anatomical situation presented by the deaf cochlea and how the different parts of an implant system (including the user’s brain) must work together to produce the best results.

We also describe two recent advances in implant design and performance. In concluding sections, we first present strengths and limitations of present systems and then offer some possibilities for further improvements in this technology.

40|$|Single-trial event-related {{responses}} {{collected during}} the course of an experiment are typically averaged before analysis resulting in a rather crude picture of event-related brain dynamics. It has been quite clear for some time that these responses exhibit trial-to-trial variability: however, the computational techniques necessary to deal with such responses in noisy conditions have not been available. To this end we have developed the multiple-component, event-related potential model (mcERP), which assumes that the each event-related response consists of a sum of multiple evoked components each described by a stereotypical waveshape. These waveshapes are allowed to vary in amplitude and onset latency from trial to trial, which allows us to capture, to first-order, the trial-dependent variations in event-related brain dynamics. We have constructed many sets of synthetic data designed to simulate intracortical recordings from a 15 channel, linear-array <b>multielectrode</b> <b>implanted</b> acutely in V 1 of an awake-behaving macaque undergoing visual stimulation with a red light flash. This synthetic data was used to characterize the performance of the mcERP algorithm. First we quantified the degree to which such trial-to-trial variability aids in the identification of multiple components, and we demonstrate that amplitude variability is a more important factor in component separation than latency variability. Second, we quantified the behavior of the algorithm under two distinct signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions: Gaussian noise independently present in each channel, and highly correlated (1 /f distributed), far-field noise presented identically in each channel of the array. The mcERP algorithm was found to be robust to noise accurately identifying all component waveshapes and their associated single-trial characteristics down to SNR levels of - 20 dB for Gaussian noise and - 7 dB for 1 /f far-field noise. Comparisons of the performance of this algorithm with factor analysis (FA) and independent component analysis (ICA) will be described by Knuth et al. (SFN abstracts, 2002).

The objective here was to characterize how dopamine modulates the somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) and its receptive field in SMC. SEPs were evoked by median and tibial nerve stimulation and recorded using thin-film <b>multielectrode</b> arrays <b>implanted</b> epidurally over the caudal sensorimotor cortex of rats. SEP amplitudes and receptive fields were measured before and after intracortical injection of a D 1 - (SCH 23390) or a D 2 -receptor antagonist (raclopride).

Dopamine antagonists increase the excitability of sensorimotor cortex to afferent signals. Dopamine, therefore, expectedly reduces SMC excitability thereby improving sensory signal-to-noise ratio.

This paper presents a novel application of an unsupervised neural network for clustering neural spike trains with transient responses. This network is constructed by incorporating projective clustering into an adaptive resonance type neural network (ART) architecture resulting in a PART neural network. Since comparisons are made between inputs and learned patterns using only a subset {{of the total number of}} available dimensions, PART neural net-works are ideally suited to the {{detection of}} transients.

40|$|Characterizing the {{functional}} connectivity between neurons is key for understanding brain function. We recorded spikes and local field potentials (LFPs) from <b>multielectrode</b> arrays <b>implanted</b> in monkey visual cortex {{to test the}} hypotheses that spikes generated outward-traveling LFP waves {{and the strength of}} functional connectivity depended on stimulus contrast, as described recently. These hypotheses were proposed based on the observation that the latency of the peak negativity of the spike-triggered LFP average (STA) increased with distance between the spike and LFP electrodes, and the magnitude of the STA negativity and the distance over which it was observed decreased with increasing stimulus contrast. Detailed analysis of the shape of the STA, however, revealed contributions from two distinct sources-a transient negativity in the LFP locked to the spike (similar to 0 ms) that attenuated rapidly with distance, and a low-frequency rhythm with peak negativity similar to 25 ms after the spike that attenuated slowly with distance. The overall negative peak of the LFP, which combined both these components, shifted from similar to 0 to similar to 25 ms going from electrodes near the spike to electrodes far from the spike, giving an impression of a traveling wave, although the shift was fully explained by changing contributions from the two fixed components. The low-frequency rhythm was attenuated during stimulus presentations, decreasing the overall magnitude of the STA. These results highlight the importance of accounting for the network activity while using STAs to determine functional connectivity...|$|R
40|$|Contemporary {{auditory}} prostheses (“cochlear implants”) employ {{arrays of}} stimulating electrodes {{implanted in the}} scala tympani of the cochlea. Such arrays have been implanted in some 100, 000 profoundly or severely deaf people worldwide and arguably are the most successful of present-day neural prostheses. Nevertheless, most implant users show poor understanding of speech in noisy backgrounds, poor pitch recognition, and poor spatial hearing, even when using bilateral implants. Many of these limitations {{can be attributed to}} the remote location of stimulating electrodes relative to excitable cochlear neural elements. That is, a scala tympani electrode array lies within a bony compartment filled with electrically conductive fluid. Moreover, scala tympani arrays typically do not extend to the apical turn of the cochlea in which low frequencies are represented. In the present study, we have tested in an animal model an alternative to the conventional cochlear implant: a <b>multielectrode</b> array <b>implanted</b> directly into the auditory nerve. We monitored the specificity of stimulation of the auditory pathway by recording extracellular unit activity at 32 sites along the tonotopic axis of the inferior colliculus. The results demonstrate the activation of specific auditory nerve populations throughout essentially the entire frequency range that is represented by characteristic frequencies in the inferior colliculus. Compared to conventional scala tympani stimulation, thresholds for neural excitation are as much as 50 -fold lower and interference between electrodes stimulated simultaneously is markedly reduced. The results suggest that if an intraneural stimulating array were incorporated into an auditory prosthesis system for humans, it could offer substantial improvement in hearing replacement compared to contemporary cochlear implants...|$|R

40|$|<b>Multielectrode</b> {{cochlear}} <b>implants</b> rely on {{differential stimulation}} of the cochlear nerve for presenting the brain with the spectral and timing information required to understand speech. In implant patients, the degree of overlap among cochlear nerve fibers stimulated by the different electrodes constitutes the electrode interaction. Electrode interaction degrades the spectral resolution of the implant’s stimulus. We sought to define electrode interaction in a cohort of pediatric cochlear implant subjects {{as a function of}} both stimulus intensity and electrode location along the array. The 27 pediatric subjects that completed the study were implanted with either the Clarion Hi-Focus array with or without positioner, the Nucleus 24 Contour array, or the Nucleus 24 Straight array. All but two of the patients had congenital hearing loss, and none of the patients had meningitis prior to the onset of deafness. The cochlear nerve response was measured with the electrically evoked compound action potential (ECAP). A forward masking protocol was used such that a probe stimulus electrode remained fixed while a preceding masker was moved across the array. Electrode interaction was estimated by measuring the unmasked probe response minus the masked probe response. Three probe locations and three probe intensities were examined for each subject. At all probe locations, electrode interaction increased as probe intensity increased (p < 0. 05). Interaction at the basal probe was less than that at either the middle or apical probe locations (p < 0. 05), and significant correlation found between probe distance from the basal end of the array and electrode interaction (p < 0. 001). These results demonstrate that in this cohort of pediatric subjects, electrode interaction depended on both stimulus intensity and probe location. Implications of these findings on future implant array design and current implant fitting strategies are discussed. The impact of electrode interaction on implant performance is yet to be elucidated...|$|R
40|$|Adaptational aftereffects {{have often}} been {{described}} as the “psychophysicist’s electrode” because of their ability to isolate specific populations of neurons related to perception. We have recently demonstrated that adaptational aftereffects can systematically and precisely bias the perception of complex patterns such as faces (Leopold et al., 2001). These results suggested a privileged role for the prototype or ‘central tendency’ of an object category in the representation of faces, which may be expressed in the selective responses of neurons in the inferotemporal cortex. Specifically, the analysis of a complex sensory pattern may involve a comparison with a prototype representation implicitly stored in the sensory apparatus. The present study is a first step to investigating this hypothesis in alert, behaving, monkeys. Two monkeys were trained to indicate the identity of up to four individual faces by pressing one of four buttons. In the first experiment they were shown brief presentations of faces whose identity was modulated between the mean face and each individual, and required to identify the face. In the second experiment a 4 -second adaptation to a different face preceded each test face presentation. Without adaptation, thresholds for discriminating between the memorized faces were evaluated in both monkeys, and were very similar to those of humans performing the same task. Following adaptation, perception was biased according to the structure of the adapting stimulus. The nature and magnitude of the adaptation effects were very similar to that observed in humans. These results suggest that mechanisms underlying face recognition in the monkey are similar to those present in humans, even when it is across species. Current studies are underway using <b>multielectrode</b> bundles <b>implanted</b> in the inferotemporal cortex of both monkeys to elucidate the role of the prototype in the neural representation of faces...|$|R
40|$|It {{is clear}} from {{a large number of}} {{electrophysiological}} studies in primates that complex patterns and objects are selectively represented in the firing of neurons in the visual cortex. However, less clear are the computational strategies by which the brain encodes and differentiates between highly similar patterns, such as that used in recognizing the identity of an individual face. One possibility is that such neural encoding proceeds in a parametric manner, exploiting the naturally occurring intra-category variability. We have recently demonstrated that adaptational aftereffects can systematically and precisely bias the perception of faces (Leopold et al., 2001). Our results suggest a privileged role for the prototype or central tendency face in the decoding of face identity. We speculated that the analysis of a complex sensory pattern may involve a comparison with a prototype representation implicitly stored in the sensory apparatus. The present study is a first step to investigating this hypothesis in alert, behaving, monkeys. Two monkeys were trained to indicate the identity of up to four individual faces by pressing one of four buttons.

Baseline discrimination thresholds as a function of face identity were similar to those of humans performing the same task. When the discrimination was preceded by a 4 -second adaptation with a different face, perception was biased according to the structure of the adapting stimulus, again {{in a manner similar to}} humans.

Previous real-time methods applied to decoding behavioral commands from {{the activity of}} populations of neurons have generally relied upon linear models of neural tuning and were limited {{in the way they}} used the abundant statistical information contained in the movement profiles of motor tasks. Here, we propose an n-th order unscented Kalman filter which implements two key features: (1) use of a non-linear (quadratic) model of neural tuning which describes neural activity significantly better than commonly-used linear tuning models, and (2) augmentation of the movement state variables with a history of n- 1 recent states, which improves prediction of the desired command even before incorporating neural activity information and allows the tuning model to capture relationships between neural activity and movement at multiple time offsets simultaneously.

40|$|Abstract—Neural {{decoding}} {{has played}} a key role in recent advances in brain–machine interfaces (BMIs) by converting brain signals into control commands to drive external devices such as robotic limbs or computer cursors. A number of practical algo-rithms including the well-known linear regression and Kalman filter models have been used to predict continuous movement in a real-time online context using recordings from a chronically <b>implanted</b> <b>multielectrode</b> microarray in the motor cortex. Though effective, those models were often based on a strong assumption that the neural signal sequence is a stationary process. Recent work, however, indicates that the motor system significantly varies over time. To characterize the dynamic relationship between neural signals and hand kinematics, here we develop an adaptive approach for each of the linear regression and Kalman filter methods. Experimental results show that the new adaptive algo-rithms generate more accurate decoding than the nonadaptive algorithms. To make the new algorithms feasible in an online situation, we further develop a recursive update approach and theoretically demonstrate its superior efficiency. In particular, the adaptive Kalman filter is shown to be more accurate and efficient. We also test the new methods in a simulated BMI experiment where the true hand motion is not known. The successful perfor-mance suggests these methods could be useful decoding algorithms for practical applications.

40|$|Complex {{movements}} require accurate temporal {{coordination between}} their components. The temporal acuity of such coordination has {{been attributed to}} an internal clock signal provided by inferior olivary oscillations. However, a clock signal can produce only time intervals that are multiples of the cycle duration. Because olivary oscillations are in the range of 5 – 10 Hz, they can support intervals of ≈ 100 – 200 ms, significantly longer than intervals suggested by behavioral studies. Here, we provide evidence that by generating nonzero-phase differences, olivary oscillations can support intervals shorter than the cycle period. Chronically <b>implanted</b> <b>multielectrode</b> arrays were used to monitor the activity of the cerebellar cortex in freely moving rats. Harmaline was administered to accentuate the oscillatory properties of the inferior olive. Olivary-induced oscillations were observed on most electrodes with a similar frequency. Most importantly, oscillations in different recording sites retained a constant phase difference that assumed a variety of values in the range of 0 – 180 °, and were maintained across large global changes in the oscillation frequency. The inferior olive may thus underlie not only rhythmic activity and synchronization, but also temporal patterns that require intervals shorter than the cycle duration. The maintenance of phase differences across frequency changes enables the olivo-cerebellar system to replay temporal patterns at different rates without distortion, allowing the execution of tasks at different speeds...|$|R
40|$|The {{successful}} {{development of}} motor neuroprosthetic devices {{hinges on the}} ability to accurately and reliably decode signals from the brain. Motor neuroprostheses are widely investigated in behaving non-human primates, but technical constraints have limited progress in optimizing performance. In particular, the organization of movement-related neuronal activity across cortical layers remains poorly understood due, in part, to the widespread use of fixed-geometry multielectrode arrays. In this study, we use chronically <b>implanted</b> <b>multielectrode</b> arrays with individually movable electrodes to examine how the encoding of movement goals depends on cortical depth. In a series of recordings spanning several months, we varied the depth of each electrode in the prearcuate gyrus of frontal cortex in two monkeys as they performed memory-guided eye movements. We decode eye movement goals from local field potentials (LFPs) and multiunit spiking activity recorded across a range of depths up to 3 mm from the cortical surface. We show that both LFP andmultiunit signals yield the highest decoding performance at superficial sites, within 0. 5 mm of the cortical surface, while performance degrades substantially at sites deeper than 1 mm. We also analyze performance by varying bandpass filtering characteristics and simulating changes in microelectrode array channel count and density. The results indicate that the performance of LFP-based neuroprostheses strongly depends on recording configuration and that recording depth is a critical parameter limiting system performance...|$|R

While {{there is evidence that}} feedforward and feedback mechanisms are both widespread, we hypothesize that causality in only one direction would typically predominate, especially in specialized circuits such as the sensory systems. This work uses both a cortical network model and in vivo experimental data from a visual attention task to investigate modulations in two related phenomena: alpha oscillations, and the strength and direction of causal interactions between cortical layers. The cortical model consists of nine columns of sixlayered cortex, comprising a total of 4230 event-driven, rule-based neurons distributed among 13 distinct cell populations [1]. Inter- and intra-columnar connections are based on known anatomical connectivity patterns. The model is driven by subthreshold, Poisson-distributed synaptic input; attentional effects are modeled as increased input to supragranular layers. Output from the model was compared to experimental data recorded from two macaques performing a sensory discrimination task [2, 3].

Skin electrodes are not appropriate to provide representative recordings, due to the voluminous pneumatic frontal sinus of minipigs. Therefore, epidural electrodes were permanently implanted in minipigs and tested with visual and electrical retinal stimulation. The present study describes long-term recordings of electrically evoked cortical potentials in minipigs. Methods: Three-channel silver-silver chloride electrodes were fixed on the epidura dorsal to the primary visual cortex of one hemisphere in Göttinger minipigs. Repeated light stimulation was performed and platinum-polyimide film <b>multielectrode</b> arrays were <b>implanted</b> on the retina for electrical stimulation and were later removed. Cortical potentials were recorded after stimulation with short biphasic charge-balanced currents. Results: For up to 18 months, the implanted epidural electrodes allowed recording of visual cortex potentials evoked by visual or electrical retina stimulation. Small changes of response amplitudes in subsequent experiments indicated a stable location and recording properties of the cortex electrodes. Visual stimulation often yielded stronger responses for the contralateral eye. Superthreshold electrical retina stimulation evoked cortical responses with less delay compared to visual stimulation. We found threshold currents of 50 µA for charge-balanced biphasic trains of current impulses. Postoperative examination showed an attached and unchanged retina.

However, the functional properties of these intrinsic synaptic connections, especially their relationship with the cortical representations of body movements, have not been systematically investigated. To address this issue, we used <b>multielectrode</b> arrays chronically <b>implanted</b> in the motor cortex of two rhesus monkeys to analyze the effects of single-pulse intracortical microstimulation (sICMS) applied at one electrode on the neuronal activities recorded at all other electrodes. The temporal and spatial distribution of the evoked responses of single and multiunit activities was quantified to determine the properties of horizontal propagation. The typical responses were characterized by a brief excitatory peak followed by inhibition of longer duration. Significant excitatory responses to sICMS could be evoked up to 4 mm away from the stimulation site, but the strength of the response decreased exponentially and its latency increased linearly with the distance. We then quantified the direction and strength of the propagation in relation to the somatotopic organization of the motor cortex. We observed that following sICMS the propagation of neural activity is mainly directed rostro-caudally near the central sulcus but follows medio-lateral direction at the most anterior electrodes. The fact that these interactions are not entirely symmetrical may characterize a critical functional property of the motor cortex for the control of upper limb movements. Overall, these results support the assumption that the motor cortex is not functionally homogeneous but forms a complex network of interacting subregions...|$|R

Positioning a visual implant over the scleral surface of the eye could present a safer alternative but this stimulation modality has not been tested in diseased retinas and {{little is known about}} the altered electrophysiological properties of the retina in influencing the feasibility of such approach.

To address this issue, we employed chronically <b>implanted</b> <b>multielectrode</b> arrays (MEA) to record avalanches of action potentials (spikes) from the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of 14 rats, as they spontaneously traversed the wake-sleep cycle, explored novel objects or were subjected to anesthesia (AN). We then modeled spike avalanches to evaluate the impact of sparse MEA sampling on their statistics. We found that the size distribution of spike avalanches are well fit by lognormal distributions in FB animals, and by truncated power laws in the AN group. FB data surrogation markedly decreases {{the tail of the}} distribution, i. e. spike shuffling destroys the largest avalanches. The FB data are also characterized by multiple key features compatible with criticality in the temporal domain, such as 1 /f spectra and long-term correlations as measured by detrended fluctuation analysis. These signatures are very stable across waking, slow-wave sleep and rapid-eye-movement sleep, but collapse during anesthesia. Likewise, waiting time distributions obey a single scaling function during all natural behavioral states, but not during anesthesia. Results are equivalent for neuronal ensembles recorded from visual and tactile areas of the cerebral cortex, as well as the hippocampus. Altogether, the data provide a comprehensive link between behavior and brain criticality, revealing a unique scale-invariant regime of spike avalanches across all major behaviors...|$|R
