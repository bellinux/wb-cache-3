50|$|At one time, <b>meticillin</b> {{was used}} to treat infections caused by certain gram-positive {{bacteria}} including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. <b>Meticillin</b> is no longer effective against these organisms due to resistance.|$|E
50|$|<b>Meticillin</b> was {{discovered}} in 1960.|$|E
50|$|<b>Meticillin</b> is {{actually}} a penicillinase-resistant B-lactam antibiotic. Penicillinase is a bacterial enzyme produced by bacteria resistant to other B-lactam antibiotics which hydrolyses the antibiotic, rendering it nonfunctional. <b>Meticillin</b> is not bound and hydrolysed by penicillinase, meaning it can kill the bacteria, even if this enzyme is present.|$|E
50|$|<b>Meticillin</b> (INN), {{also known}} as {{methicillin}} (USAN), is a narrow-spectrum β-lactam antibiotic of the penicillin class. It {{should not be confused}} with the antibiotic metacycline.|$|E
50|$|<b>Meticillin</b> is {{no longer}} {{manufactured}} because the more stable and similar penicillins such as oxacillin (used for clinical antimicrobial susceptibility testing), flucloxacillin, and dicloxacillin are used medically.|$|E
5000|$|Common causes include infection, or {{reaction}} to medication {{such as an}} analgesic or antibiotics such as methicillin (<b>meticillin).</b> Reaction to medications causes 71% to 92% of cases.|$|E
50|$|Like other {{beta-lactam}} antibiotics, <b>meticillin</b> acts by inhibiting {{the synthesis}} of bacterial cell walls. It inhibits cross-linkage between the linear peptidoglycan polymer chains {{that make up a}} major component of the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria. It does this by binding to and competitively inhibiting the transpeptidase enzyme (also known as penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs)). These PBPs crosslink glycopeptides (D-alanyl-alanine), forming the peptidoglycan cell wall. <b>Meticillin</b> and other β-lactam antibiotics are structural analogs of D-alanyl-alanine, and the transpeptidase enzymes that bind to them are sometimes called penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).|$|E
50|$|<b>Meticillin</b> was {{developed}} by Beecham in 1959. It was previously used to treat infections caused by susceptible gram-positive bacteria, in particular, penicillinase-producing organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus {{that would otherwise be}} resistant to most penicillins.|$|E
50|$|Study of six {{species of}} eremophilas showed that E. duttonii {{had the highest}} {{antimicrobial}} potency, especially against gram-positive bacteria, including those that are resistant to the antibiotics <b>meticillin</b> and vancomycin. In another study, two diterpenes {{were found to be}} responsible for the antimicrobial activity of this species.|$|E
50|$|<b>Meticillin</b> is {{insensitive}} to beta-lactamase (also known as penicillinase) enzymes secreted by many penicillin-resistant bacteria. The {{presence of the}} ortho-dimethoxyphenyl group directly attached to the side-chain carbonyl group of the penicillin nucleus facilitates the β-lactamase resistance, since those enzymes are relatively intolerant of side-chain steric hindrance. Thus, {{it is able to}} bind to PBPs and inhibit peptidoglycan crosslinking, but it is not bound by or inactivated by β-lactamases.|$|E
5000|$|European Union {{legislation}} from 2001 required harmonisation of the BP {{with the}} European Pharmacopoeia (EP), {{as well as}} the adoption of International Nonproprietary Names through directives (2001/82/EC [...] and 2001/83/EC, as amended, and 2003/63/EC [...] ). Across the EU has meant that, with the notable exception of adrenaline/epinephrine, BANs are now the same as the INNs. For example, the old BAN methicillin was replaced with the current BAN <b>meticillin,</b> matching the INN.|$|E
5000|$|From 1945, Beecham Research Laboratories Ltd (which {{merged with}} SmithKline, then with Glaxo, to become GlaxoSmithKline) {{operated}} from Brockham Park {{at the southern}} end of the village.In 1959, Brockham Park became famous when Beecham scientists there discovered the penicillin nucleus, 6-APA (6-aminopenicillanic acid); this discovery allowed the synthesis of a number of new semisynthetic penicillins. In 1959, Beecham marketed pheneticillin, followed shortly by methicillin (or <b>meticillin),</b> which is active against the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus ('golden staph'). [...] In time some bacterial strains developed resistance to these antibiotics, such as the MRSA (for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). The site is now a housing estate.|$|E
50|$|Compared {{to other}} {{penicillins}} that face antimicrobial resistance due to β-lactamase, {{it is less}} active, can be administered only parenterally, and has a higher frequency of interstitial nephritis, an otherwise-rare adverse effect of penicillins. However, selection of <b>meticillin</b> depended {{on the outcome of}} susceptibility testing of the sampled infection, and since it is no longer produced, it is also not routinely tested for any more. It also served a purpose in the laboratory to determine the antibiotic sensitivity of Staphylococcus aureus to other penicillins facing β-lactam resistance; this role has now been passed on to other penicillins, namely cloxacillin, as well as genetic testing for the presence of mecA gene by PCR.|$|E
50|$|William Harvey of Folkestone, in Kent, {{discovered}} {{the circulation of}} blood. The Lilly Research Centre in Windlesham, Berkshire, part of Eli Lilly, developed Olanzapine in 1996 (for bipolar disorder, selling around $5bn worldwide annually). Beecham Research Laboratories at Brockham Park in 1959 discovered <b>meticillin</b> (or methicillin), the first semi-synthetic penicillin (beta-lactamase stable), deriving from their discovery in 1958 of 6-APA, the core constituent; the team, led by Prof George Rolinson, won the Mullard Award in 1971. Bipyridine compounds (Paraquat-Gramoxone and Diquat) were discovered for herbicide use in 1954 by William Boon at ICI's Plant Protection division at Jealott's Hill, being released onto the market in 1958. AZT/Retrovir (zidovudine) was first manufactured by Wellcome in 1987 in Kent; they also introduced Zovirax (aciclovir), and the naturally occurring digoxin, a cardiac glycoside. After a plane crashed near his house in Oxford in 1940, Sir Peter Medawar helped the injured pilot, {{and in the process}} discovered homograft rejection, leading to organ transplantation using azathioprine. Viagra (Sildenafil) was synthesized at Pfizer in Sandwich, Kent.|$|E
30|$|No <b>meticillin</b> {{resistant}} staphylococcus aureus, nor carbapenemase producing {{pseudomonas aeruginosa}} or acinetobacter baumanii were isolated.|$|E
30|$|Blood {{cultures}} {{were positive}} in 8 cases of which 5 contained 2 different micro-organisms. The identified micro-organisms were: <b>Meticillin</b> Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (n =  6), <b>Meticillin</b> Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (n =  3), coagulase-negative staphylococcus (n =  2), Enterobacter cloacae (n =  1), and candida famata (n =  1). Occurring complications were hospital-acquired infections (n =  5), septic pulmonary embolism (n =  4), withdrawal syndrome (5 cases), {{acute renal failure}} (n =  2) and atrioventricular block (n =  2).|$|E
40|$|<b>Meticillin</b> was {{introduced}} in 1959 to treat infections caused by penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. In 1961 there were reports from the UK of S aureus isolates that had acquired resistance to <b>meticillin</b> (meticillin-resistant S aureus, MRSA). Similar MRSA isolates were soon found in other European countries, and later from Japan, Australia, and the USA. Today MRSA is {{a major cause of}} hospital-acquired infections, and a serious public-health concern.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} institution-specific risk factors for <b>meticillin</b> resistance in Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection (BSI) and to evaluate the impact of <b>meticillin</b> resistance on mortality. A total of 154 episodes of S. aureus BSI were identified between 1 January 2002 and 31 December 2004 : 66 meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) BSI and 88 meticillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) BSI. Seventy-eight episodes (51 %) were considered to be community-acquired and 76 (49 %) as nosocomial. Risk factors associated with MRSA BSI included not living at home (P= 0. 001), prior antibiotic exposure (P= 0. 002), insulin-requiring diabetes (P= 0. 028) and nosocomial BSI (P= 0. 031), especially more than 12. 5 days after admission. There was an association between BSI-related mortality and the following variables: septic shock (P< 0. 001), endocarditis (P= 0. 002) and MRSA BSI (P= 0. 021). In conclusion, S. aureus BSI is a serious condition, especially when septic shock or endocarditis occurs, and is aggravated by <b>meticillin</b> resistance. We advise glycopeptides as empirical therapy for patients not arriving from home, those exposed to antibiotics, and those with insulin-requiring diabetes and/or nosocomial BSI.

40|$|Orthopaedic infections due to coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and meticillin-resistant strains may be increasing. We {{assessed}} secular {{trends of}} CoNS infections and {{factors associated with}} <b>meticillin</b> resistance by performing a 13 -year retrospective cohort study of orthopaedic patients with CoNS infections from January 1995 to December 2007. Of 60 CoNS infections, 57 (95 %) were implant-related. Median follow-up after end of treatment was 5. 1 years (range: 2. 4 - 13. 8). During the study period, 44, 237 orthopaedic procedures were performed, 21, 299 (48 %) with implants. The overall cumulative incidence of CoNS-associated infection was 0. 14 % and 0. 28 % for implant-related procedures. There were non-significant changes in the absolute number or cumulative incidence of CoNS infection (chi-squared test, P values for trend: 0. 45  and 0. 97, respectively). Forty-five episodes (75 %) were due to meticillin-resistant strains. The proportion of <b>meticillin</b> resistance remained stable over time (P for trend: 0. 65). Whereas few (4 / 15) meticillin-susceptible strains were associated with prior prophylaxis that covered the causative pathogen, 28 / 45 meticillin-resistant strains were associated with inadequate prophylaxis (P= 0. 03). The cumulative incidence of orthopaedic CoNS infection is low and stable in our institution and almost exclusively implant-related. The proportion of <b>meticillin</b> resistance among CoNS has remained stable {{over the last decade}} with a favourable clinical outcome...|$|E

3000|$|The {{frequency}} of antibiotic resistance is profoundly {{different from one}} European country to another. Europe was subject of an antibiotherapy study (ICAAC), made by the team of Prof Voss, presented in 1992 to the U.S. Congress and published few years later (Voss et al. 1994). This study showed considerable differences in resistance rates of Staphylococcus aureus to <b>meticillin</b> (MRSA) between European countries, with rates ranging from 0 % in some northern countries (Finland, Denmark, Sweden) to 35 % and 40 % in some countries that are more [...] "Latin" [...] (Italy, France). In some countries, MRSA studies, (Voss et al. 1994; Goldstein and Acar 1995) show that almost all strains were resistant to other antibiotics, especially quinolones and rifampicin. Resistance of Staphylococcus aureus to <b>meticillin</b> increased also in the most medically-advanced countries, even in United States of America (Gaynes et al. 1993).
