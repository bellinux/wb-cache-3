25|$|Stray voltage is {{a result}} of the design of a 4 wire {{distribution}} system and as such has existed as long as such systems have been used. Stray voltage became a problem for the dairy industry some time after electric <b>milking</b> <b>machines</b> were introduced, and large numbers of animals were simultaneously in contact with metal objects grounded to the electric distribution system and the earth. Numerous studies document the causes, physiological effects, and prevention, of stray voltage in the farm environment. Today, stray voltage on farms is regulated by state governments and controlled by the design of equipotential planes in areas where livestock eat, drink or give milk. Commercially available neutral isolators also prevent elevated potentials on the utility system neutral from raising the voltage of farm neutral or ground wires.|$|E

2500|$|In {{herringbone}} {{and parallel}} parlors, the milker generally milks one row at a time. The milker will move {{a row of}} cows from the holding yard into the milking parlor, and milk each cow in that row. Once all of the <b>milking</b> <b>machines</b> {{have been removed from}} the milked row, the milker releases the cows to their feed. A new group of cows is then loaded into the now vacant side and the process repeats until all cows are milked. Depending {{on the size of the}} milking parlor, which normally is the bottleneck, these rows of cows can range from four to sixty at a time. The benefits of a herringbone parlour are easy maintenance, the durability, stability, and improved safety for animals and humans when compared to tie stall ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{goal of this}} {{graduation}} thesis was to {{find out}} influence of <b>milking</b> <b>machine</b> {{on the behavior of}} dairy cows and detection of possible different influence of milking AMS on first-calver and milking cows after other lactation. The first part of this thesis was focused on the observation of the milking cows 30 minutes after the milking cows left the <b>milking</b> <b>machine,</b> which took place 24 hours and was focused on the activities of all dairy cows in the herd. The observation identified a need for food intake, drinking and lying down. Another part of this thesis was focused on average daily milk yield of whole herd and each cow as well by using data from <b>milking</b> <b>machine</b> Lely Astronaut, amount of using of <b>milking</b> <b>machine,</b> the duration of the preparation time for milking, time of milking. The results of each part were compared between the first-calver and the other dairy cows. During the day was found out a need for drinking after milking at 40. 4 % for first-calver and 41, 7 % for cows with more than one lactation. A need for food intake was identified at the rate of 75 % for first-calver and 88, 6 % for other cows. A need to lie down in 30 minutes after milking had 12 % of first-calver and 13 % of the other cows. Total preparation time for milking was 2 : 04 minutes for first-calver and 1 : 54 minutes for the other cows...|$|R

40|$|Little {{work has}} been carried out on {{management}} techniques to reduce stress of first <b>machine</b> <b>milking</b> in ewes. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of milking parlour training before weaning on sheep milk yield and milk protein fractions. One week before weaning, an experimental group (EG) was introduced into the <b>machine</b> <b>milking</b> parlour and hand-milked once a day, to adapt them to the new environment and noise of the <b>milking</b> <b>machine,</b> while a control group (CG) was hand-milked once a day in a traditional fold parlour until weaning. After weaning, both groups were <b>machine</b> <b>milked,</b> separately, twice a day in the milking parlour. Milk yield and nitrogen fractions were recorded for the first 10 days of <b>machine</b> <b>milking.</b> Differences between samplings within group were observed for all parameters considered. Only {{on the first day of}} <b>machine</b> <b>milking,</b> differences between groups occurred for total nitrogen, total protein and casein. Higher content of nitrogen fractions in the milk of EG was due to its lower milk production. In fact, daily production of nitrogen fractions was higher in CG than in EG. High variability for most parameters was observed during the first 5 days of <b>machine</b> <b>milking</b> in both groups.

40|$|Abstract Part I. A {{series of}} {{experiments}} were performed to measure behavioral and blood cortisol concentration responses of cows exposed to current applied from front to rear hooves. Increased activity level was not a consistent indicator of response to current, whereas a startle response (flinch) was a consistent and repeatable indicator. Cows responded at lower current levels to the 1 -front to 2 -rear hoof pathway than to muzzle to 4 -hooves pathway. Cortisol levels did not increase in response to current exposure at levels up to 1. 5 times the behavioral reaction level. Cortisol concentrations were found, however, to increase in response to hoof trimming. It appears for these results that behavioral changes are amore sensitive indicator of response to current than blood cortisol levels. This result agrees with several past studies. Abstract Part II.
