40|$|A new acetotrophic marine <b>methane-producing</b> <b>bacterium</b> {{that was}} {{isolated}} from the methane-evolving sediments of a marine canyon is described. Exponential phase cultures grown with sodium acetate contained irregularly shaped cocci that aggregated in the early stationary phase and finally differentiated into communal cysts that released individual cocci when ruptured or transferred to fresh medium. The irregularly shaped cocci (1. 9 ± 0. 2 mm in diameter) were gram negative and occurred singly or in pairs. Cells were nonmotile, but possessed a single fimbria-like structure. Micrographs of thin sections showed a monolayered cell wall approximately 10 nm thick that consisted of protein subunits. The cells in aggregates were separated by visible septation. The communal cysts contained several single cocci encased in a common envelope. An amorphous form of the communal cyst that had incomplete septation and internal membrane-like vesicles was also present in late exponential phase cultures. Sodium acetate, methanol, methylamine, dimethylamine, and trimethylamine were substrates for growth and methanogenesis; H 2 -CO 2 (80 : 20) and sodium formate were not. The optimal growth temperature was 35 to 40 °C. The optimal pH range was 6. 5 to 7. 0. Both NaCl and Mg 2 + were required for growth, with maximum growth rates at 0. 2 M NaCl and 0. 05 M MgSO 4. The DNA base composition was 41 ± 1 % guanine plus cytosine. Methanosarcina acetivorans is the proposed species. C 2 A is the type strain (DSM 2834, ATCC 35395) ...|$|E

The author carried out some experiments on anaerobic bacteria, especially the organisms of Clostridium and <b>methane-producing</b> <b>bacteria</b> found in samples of night-soil. The studies were performed with a view to contributing to fundamental studies on gas production in the digestion of night soil. 1. Of anaerobic bacteria found in raw night-soil, digested sludge and supernatant in a digestion tank on a pilot plan, the organisms of Clostridium accounted for the majority. They were always detected in larger numbers in digested sludge than in supernatant, and there was little change in their numbers during the whole period of experiments. 2. When 11 strains of Clostridium isolated from night-soil were implanted in Prevot 2 ̆ 7 s methane-producing mediums, none of them were shown to be capable of producing methane by itself. There was, however, a production of methane in one medium inoculated with one of the series of sets of 5 strains selected at random from among the 11 strains, the amount produced representing 4. 8 per cent of the total amount of gases produced. When each one of these 11 strains was implanted in a Laigret 2 ̆ 7 s medium separately, there was a production of methane in two mediums, representing 7. 4 and 5. 1 per cent, respectively, of the total amounts of gases produced.

40|$|Anoxic {{salt marsh}} sediments were amended with {{dl-methionine}} and dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP). Microbial metabolism of methionine yielded methane thiol (MSH) {{as the major}} volatile organosulfur product, {{with the formation of}} lesser amounts of dimethylsulfide (DMS). Biological transformation of DMSP resulted in the rapid release of DMS and only small amounts of MSH. Experiments with microbial inhibitors indicated that production of MSH from methionine was carried out by procaryotic organisms, probably sulfate-reducing <b>bacteria.</b> <b>Methane-producing</b> <b>bacteria</b> did not metabolize methionine. The involvement of specific groups of organisms in DMSP hydrolysis could not be determined with the inhibitors used, because DMSP was hydrolyzed in all samples except those which were autoclaved. Unamended sediment slurries, prepared from Spartina alterniflora sediments, contained significant (1 to 10 μM) concentrations of DMS. Endogenous methylated sulfur compounds and those produced from added methionine and DMSP were consumed by sediment microbes. Both sulfate-reducing and <b>methane-producing</b> <b>bacteria</b> were involved in DMS and MSH consumption. Methanogenesis was stimulated by the volatile organosulfur compounds released from methionine and DMSP. However, apparent competition for these compounds exists between methanogens and sulfate reducers. At low (1 μM) concentrations of methionine, the terminal S-methyl group was metabolized almost exclusively to CO 2 and only small amounts of CH 4. At higher (> 100 μM) concentrations of methionine, the proportion of the methyl-sulfur group converted to CH 4 increased.

The technique used periodic oxygen injection using oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) as a controlling parameter to regulate oxygen injection. The UAF was operated at a constant influent total-organic carbon of 6740 mg/L but with different influent sulfates of 1000, 3000, and 6000 mg/L. At 1000 and 3000 mg/L influent sulfates, the produced sulfide did not impose any inhibition to <b>methane-producing</b> <b>bacteria</b> (MPB).

Applying manure can also enhance animal and crop production by reducing the costs of fertilizer. However, manure application can cause odor complaints from neighbors and surrounding communities.

This fact sheet presents a basic understanding of odors and odor dispersion and highlights best management practices for controlling odors during manure application. What Is Odor? Odor is an unpleasant smell caused by odorous gases and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These volatile organic compounds are organic acids, and they evaporate easily. Under ideal anaerobic conditions, manure is degraded by acid-forming microorganisms into volatile organic compounds (Figure 1). These compounds are further metabolized by <b>methane-producing</b> <b>bacteria</b> into methane, carbon dioxide, and water, which are odor-free compounds.

There was also {{an increase}} in carbon dioxide concentration at that depth. The decrease in oxygen concentrations and the increase in carbon dioxide concentration at the 40 ft bgs level could be possible indicators of natural attenuation. It is not possible to determine trends or biodegradation rates with the limited amount of data collected from the site. The sample results from this first monitoring period did not correlate with the baseline results collected in August 2000. Additional samples will be collected and the results will be compared to previously collected samples to determine if the site was at equilibrium in August 2000. Continued annual monitoring will be conducted as specified in the Closure Report to determine trends at the site. As natural attenuation occurs, the TPH concentrations should decrease. The TPH concentrations will be compared over successive monitoring events to determine trends and approximate rates. As natural attenuation occurs, oxygen will be consumed and carbon dioxide will be produced. The oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide concentrations will also be evaluated to determine if biodegradation is indicated. When all available oxygen has been consumed, <b>methane-producing</b> <b>bacteria</b> may continue the natural attenuation process so methane levels will be monitored as an additional possible indicator of natural attenuation. The rate of decrease will be determined on the microbial populations, contaminant concentrations, available nutrients, and other environmental factors. Samples were collected and submitted for microbial analysis during closure activities. The results indicated that the microbial populations and nutrients were adequate for limited bioremediation (DOE/NV, 2000). Additional sampling for microbial analysis are not planned. The site is currently inactive and the source of additional contamination was removed. It was determined during closure activities that the wetting front has stabilized. Monitoring of Borehole DRA- 3 has not shown any indications of contamination. Contamination migration to the water table is not expected based on current site conditions...|$|R
30|$|Cow {{manure and}} anaerobically digested cow manure were {{collected}} from a dairy farm (Shandong Province, China). The collected fresh cow manure slurry was then introduced into continuous digesters for methane generation. The anaerobic digestion could efficiently occur between 25  °C and 40  °C. In this process, organic substances are decomposed and converted into biogas by <b>methane-producing</b> <b>bacteria</b> under anaerobic conditions. Saccharomyces cerevisiae LF 1 (Li et al. 2016) was cultured in YPD medium (1 % yeast extract, 2 % peptone, and 2 % glucose) at 30  °C and 200  rpm. To induce cellulase expression, we precultivated Penicillium oxalicum C 1 - 9 (Yao et al. 2016) on Vogel’s medium containing 1 [*]×[*]Vogel’s salt solution and 2 % glucose for 26  h. A 50 [*]×[*]Vogel’s salt solution stock containing the following was prepared: 125  g/L Na 3 Citrate· 2 H 2 O, 250  g/L KH 2 PO 4, 100  g/L NH 4 NO 3, 10  g/L MgSO 4 · 7 H 2 O, 5  g/L CaCl 2 · 2 H 2 O, 0.25  mg/L biotin, and 5  mL/L trace element solution (50  g/L Citric acid·H 2 O, 50  g/L ZnSO 4 · 7 H 2 O, 10  g/L Fe(NH 4) 2 (SO 4) 2 · 6 H 2 O, 2.5  g/L CuSO 4 · 5 H 2 O, 0.5  g/L MnSO 4 · 1 H 2 O, 0.5  g/L H 3 BO 3, and 0.5  g/L Na 2 MoO 4 · 2 H 2 O). The vegetative mycelia were collected through vacuum drum filtration and then inoculated into 500  mL flasks containing 100  mL of fermentation medium at an initial pH of 5.5 at 30  °C and 200  rpm. Fermentation medium contained 0.60 % Avicel, 2 % corn cob residue, 4.66 % wheat bran, 1 % soybean cake power, 0.20 %(NH 4) 2 SO 4, 0.10 % urea, 0.28 % NaNO 3, 0.30 % KH 2 PO 3, and 0.05 % MgSO 4 · 7 H 2 O. To test cellulase production by P. oxalicum C 1 - 9 using cow manure, we added 4 % cow manure or 4 % anaerobically digested cow manure to replace 2 % corn cob residue in fermentation medium.|$|R
40|$|The {{volatile}} antimony compound trimethylantimony (TMA) {{was detected}} in headspace gases over anaerobic soil enrichment cultures spiked with potassium antimony tartrate. The presence of TMA was variable (12 positives from 104 cultures) and dependent upon both the inoculum source (environmental sample) and enrichment culture conditions. Positives for TMA formation were obtained with variable frequency for {{four of the}} six soils tested and for three types of enrichment culture, designed to encourage growth of nitrate-reducing, <b>methane-producing</b> or fermentative <b>bacteria.</b> The identity of the volatile antimony compound produced {{in each of the three}} types of enrichment culture was confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-atomic absorption spectroscopy. There was no evidence of any other volatile antimony compound in the headspace gases. These data suggest that the capability to generate TMA is widely distributed in the terrestrial environment and is attributable to different metabolic types of micro-organisms...|$|R
40|$|Methanosarcina acetivorans, a {{strictly}} anaerobic methane-producing species {{belonging to the}} domain Archaea, contains a gene cluster annotated with homologs encoding oxidative stress proteins. One of the genes (MA 3736) is annotated as a gene encoding an uncharacterized carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase, an enzyme required for aerobic growth with aromatic compounds by species in the domain <b>Bacteria.</b> <b>Methane-producing</b> species are not known to utilize aromatic compounds, suggesting that MA 3736 is incorrectly annotated. The product of MA 3736, overproduced in Escherichia coli, had protein disulfide reductase activity dependent on a C 67 XXC 70 motif not found in carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase. We propose that MA 3736 be renamed mdrA (methanosarcina disulfide reductase). Further, unlike carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase, MdrA contained an Fe-S cluster. Binding of the Fe-S cluster was dependent on essential cysteines C 67 and C 70, while cysteines C 39 and C 107 were not required. Loss of the Fe-S cluster resulted in conversion of MdrA from an inactive hexamer to a trimer with protein disulfide reductase activity. The data suggest that MdrA is the prototype of a previously unrecognized protein disulfide reductase family which contains an intermolecular Fe-S cluster that controls oligomerization as a mechanism to regulate protein disulfide reductase activity...|$|R
40|$|Microorganisms {{influence}} {{the chemical and}} physical properties of subsurface environments and thus represent an important control on the fate and environmental impact of CO 2 that leaks into aquifers from deep storage reservoirs. How leakage will influence microbial populations over long time scales is largely unknown. This study uses natural analog sites to investigate the long-term impact of CO 2 leakage from underground storage sites on subsurface biogeochemistry. We considered two sites with elevated CO 2 levels (sample groups I and II) and one control site with low CO 2 content (group III). Samples from sites with elevated CO 2 had pH ranging from 6. 2 to 4. 5 and samples from the low-CO 2 control group had pH ranging from 7. 3 to 6. 2. Solute concentrations were relatively low for samples from the control group and group I but high for samples from group II, reflecting varying degrees of water-rock interaction. Microbial communities were analyzed through clone library and MiSeq sequencing. Each 16 S rRNA analysis identified various <b>bacteria,</b> <b>methane-producing</b> archaea, and ammonia-oxidizing archaea. Both bacterial and archaeal diversities were low in groundwater with high CO 2 content and community compositions between the groups were also clearly different. In group II samples, sequences classified in groups capable of methanogenesis, metal reduction, and nitrate reduction had higher relative abundance in samples with relative high methane, iron, and manganese concentrations and low nitrate levels. Sequences close to Comamonadaceae were abundant in group I, while the taxa related to methanogens, Nitrospirae, and Anaerolineaceae were predominant in group II. Our findings provide insight into subsurface biogeochemical reactions that {{influence the}} carbon budget of the system including carbon fixation, carbon trapping, and CO 2 conversion to methane. The results also suggest that monitoring groundwater microbial community can be a potential tool for tracking CO 2 leakage from geologic storage sites...|$|R
