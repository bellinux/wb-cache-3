40|$|Abstract—In {{planetary}} {{surface exploration}} <b>mission,</b> <b>sensor</b> data distribution {{is required in}} many aspects, for example, in navigation, scheduling, planning, monitoring, diagnostics, and automation of the field tasks. The challenge is to distribute such data in the robust and reliable way {{so that we can}} minimize the errors caused by miscalculations, and misjudgments that based on the error data input in the mission. The ad-hoc wireless network on planetary surface is not constantly connected {{because of the nature of}} the rough terrain and lack of permanent establishments on the surface. There are some disconnected moments that the computation nodes will re-associate with different repeaters or access points until connections are reestablished. Such a nature requires our sensor data distribution software robust and reliable with ability to tolerant disconnected moments. This paper presents a distributed components model as a framework to accomplish such tasks. The software is written in Java and utilized the available Java Message Services schema and the JBoss implementation. The results of field experimentations show that the model is very effective in completing the tasks...|$|E

The analysis methodology presented here investigates mission requirements and generates a <b>mission</b> <b>sensor</b> package using design engineering relations. Given the broad science goals for an interplanetary science mission, the specific scientific measurements required can be determined. From the measurements the required specifications flow down, leading to an overall mission design. The mission design drives the instrumentation requirements and influences the selection of components for the mission. Components are chosen to meet mission requirements, creating an initial sensor package design. Trade studies are performed at component levels. Designs iterate on initial concepts and options are evaluated until a final design is determined. A tool for in-situ measurements is developed using systems engineering design relations to deliver a sensor payload configuration starting from the initial mission concept and the specific measurement objectives. Design of the sensor payload package for any mission is a combination of different aspects. The final design is a result of individual case studies at the component level and design engineering studies at a system level.

30|$|UWSN {{technology}} is also replacing traditional underwater instrumentation technology. Traditionally, bulky sensor nodes equipped with data-storage capability are manually {{deployed in the}} underwater target space. Each node operates independently {{for the duration of}} the mission to collect readings according to a preset program. At the end of the <b>mission,</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes are picked up, and the collected data are retrieved and processed. UWSN technology adds networking capabilities to underwater sensor nodes so that sensor nodes can relay real-time data to an off-shore or even an on-shore control station for immediate analysis. The communication channel can also be used to transmit control signals from the control station to the underwater sensor nodes, which enables interactive control of the underwater sensor network deployment. UWSNs offer many advantages over traditional instrumentation techniques. First off, UWSNs add a real-time reporting functionality that enables a host of new real-time monitoring and warning systems. Another advantage of UWSN is that the sensing mission can be dynamically reconfigured without the need to physically access all the underwater nodes in order to reprogram them. While this particular feature makes the reuse of a UWSN deployment much less costly, it also provides for fixing configuration errors that compensates for unforeseen circumstances and unexpected node failures. This improves the UWSN resilience compared to traditional instrumentation techniques. Therefore, sensor node failures can be detected soon after they occur, allowing early replacement or early abortion of the mission instead of having to wait until the end of the mission only to find that it has failed.|$|E

Based on the highly successful instrumentation suite that flew on Mars Science Laboratory (MEDLI), the new sensor suite expands on the types of measurements and also seeks to answer questions not fully addressed by the previous <b>mission.</b> <b>Sensor</b> Package: MEDLI 2 consists of 7 pressure transducers, 17 thermal plugs, 2 heat flux sensors, and one radiometer. The sensors are distributed across both the heatshield and backshell, unlike MEDLI (the first sensor suite), which was located solely on the heat-shield. The sensors will measure supersonic pressure on the forebody, a pressure measurement on the aftbody, near-surface and in-depth temperatures in the heatshield and backshell TPS materials, direct total heat flux on the aftbody, and direct radiative heating on the aftbody. Instrument Development: The supersonic pressure transducers, the direct heat flux sensors, and the radiometer all were tested during the development phase. The status of these sensors, including the piezo-resistive pressure sensors, will be presented. The current plans for qualification and calibration {{for all of the}} sensors will also be discussed. Post-Flight Data Analysis: Similar to MEDLI, the estimated flight trajectory will be reconstructed from the data. The aerodynamic parameters that will be reconstructed will be the axial force coefficient, freestream Mach number, base pressure, atmospheric density, and winds. The aerothermal quantities that will be determined are the heatshield and backshell aero-heating, turbulence transition across the heatshield, and TPS in-depth performance of PICA. By directly measuring the radiative and total heat fluxes on the back-shell, the convective portion of the heat flux will be estimated. The status of the current tools to perform the post-flight data analysis will be presented, along with plans for model improvements...|$|E
40|$|Usually Wireless Sensor {{networks}} (WSN) {{are deployed}} for long-term <b>mission.</b> <b>Sensor</b> Nodes (SN) are battery-powered. Therefore, {{the lifetime of}} a single node is limited through the lifetime of its battery. Eventually SN will start to die out and disconnect the network. SN that have crashed may disconnect other SN from the sink. In this way partitioning of the network and separation of nodes may take place. Although prediction of this network anomaly appears logically {{to be the first}} step before taking some maintenance actions, most of the approaches focus only on its detection. WSN impose energy and communication constraints, thus collecting data blindly from each individual SN and processing it at the sink is unfeasible. We propose in this thesis an efficient scheme allowing network partition prediction. Our scheme focuses on energy depletion as the major cause of network partitioning and consists of two phases: the first phase is the implementation of spatial and temporal data suppression to build energy regions in the network. We allow only dedicated nodes of energy weak regions to report alerts to the sink. The second phase is the implementation of a simple strategy at the sink to predict the next time of partitioning using the incoming alerts. Our simulation results show that using the residual energy of only nodes on the isoline, it is possible to obtain a good approximate for energy consumption in the whole WSN. The predicted time of partitioning can be provided with our scheme with an accuracy of about 80 %.

40|$|A {{primary goal}} of the current Landsat- 7 mission, {{launched}} on April 15, 1999, is to acquire and refresh on a seasonal basis, calibrated ata sets of multispectral digital imagery of the landmass of the Earth The Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imager flown on Landsat- 7 provides ground spatial resolutions in the panchromatic, reflective and emissive bands of 15, 30 and 60 meters, respectively, for a nominal scene 183 km wide by 170 km long. This mission not only builds on the invaluable 27 -year continuous archive of thematic images of the Earth provided by previous Landsat satellites, it also inaugurates {{a new era of}} robust data acquisition with an emphasis on global change science. The newly developed Long Term Acquisition Plan (LTAP) is being used to optimize the systematic collection of data {{from all parts of the}} globe, populating the U. S. -held archive at the USGS EROS Data Center (EDC) with over 90, 000 Landsat scene per year. An additional 73, 000 Images are expected to be acquired each year by several international ground stations, for a total downlink of Landsat 7 data in excess of 100 terabytes per year. Nearly 20, 000 scan of Landsat- 7 ETM+ data have already been acquired in the first 100 days of the mission. Early results derived from assessments of the ETM+ instrument, the spacecraft, and the ground processing systems indicate that the image quality is outstanding, clearly the best ever provided by any Landsat <b>mission.</b> <b>Sensor</b> radiometric background stability after the first 100 days in orbit is approximately 0. 1 percent. Stability of the Full Aperture Solar Calibrator is approximately 0. 3 percent, and mid-scale per pixel noise is approximately 0. 6 percent. A ground processing system has been implemented at EDC which is capable of capturing, processing and archiving 250 Landsat scenes 9 per day, and delivering 100 scene products to seems each day. The cost of a systematically-processed Level 1 product has been dropped dramatically to $ 600, end there is no longer any copyright protection an the data.

40|$|Abstract—Wireless sensor {{networks}} {{will play}} a critical role in space and planet exploration, allowing remote monitoring of non-easily accessible areas in preparation of human or robotic <b>missions.</b> <b>Sensors,</b> however, are fragile and can fail, reporting erroneous measurements, for example. Decisions derived from flawed sensor measurements can adversely impact the correctness of the overall sensor network findings and may jeopardize the success of the <b>mission.</b> Unfortunately, failed <b>sensors</b> in space cannot be easily diagnosed and replaced. To improve the reliability of decisions and minimize the impact of faulty sensor measurements, the preferred approach is to exploit data redundancy. In this paper, we present Confidence Weighted Voting (CWV), a distributed technique that can greatly improve the data reliability and fault tolerance of sensor network applications. We evaluate CWV against traditional approaches (e. g., Majority Voting (MV) and Distance Weighted Voting (DWV)), in the presence of flawed sensors. The results show that CWV consistently outperforms the other schemes by providing as much as 49 % more resiliency. Index Terms—Reliable decision from Sensor Network, dat...|$|R

The final design is a result of individual case studies at the component level and design engineering studies at a system level. Human decision elements are included in the design process, and final selection between competing components is made. The decision to use one flight hardware component over another can arise from many factors - functionality, heritage, Technology Readiness Level (TRL), compatibility, etc. The objective of this work is to combine selection techniques for mission hardware, based on optimization studies with engineering judgment, into a single tool that can be used to generate a preliminary sensor package configuration for planetary missions. A tool for in-situ measurements is developed using systems engineering design relations to deliver a sensor payload configuration starting from the initial mission objectives and the specific measurement types. The In-Situ Sensor Payload Optimization Tool (ISSPO) consists of a number of individual sensor modules, based on commercially available and space-rated components, and programs to determine the required components. Information on the desired mission location and types of science data to be returned, along with payload limits, are entered into the main program. For each sensor type available within the database, a corresponding module is executed and supplied information on the planetary location and additional sensor requirements. Selection of the final sensor is made based on operational ranges and required performance limits. Logic checks determine whether the sensor package meets or exceeds the mission limits, or if another combination of components would provide a viable solution with some requirement tradeoff. The resulting sensor package represents a preliminary sensor package capable of answering the mission's science requirements...|$|E

Modern photogrammetry and remote sensing is a continuously evolving field. The geometric calibration and orientation of sensors required to georeference the information has always been a major issue for all types of sensors for Earth Observation. The introduction of airborne and spaceborne high resolution digital cameras posed new challenges to image registration precision. In addition, future <b>missions,</b> <b>sensor</b> types and platforms might present totally different geometries and image registration problems: for example, LIDAR, SAR, high resolution optical scanners on unmanned air vehicles (UAV), or even space missions delivering extraterrestrial remote sensing data without the possibility to obtain ground reference.
