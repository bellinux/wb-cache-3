During summer, in response to heat and water-clogging vegetation, the turtles may vacate shallow marshes for <b>more</b> <b>permanent</b> waters.

5|$|After being towed to Mound City for <b>more</b> <b>permanent</b> repairs, Osage was {{transferred}} to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron on 1 February 1865 for the attack on Mobile, Alabama. She participated in the Battle of Spanish Fort, defending Mobile from the east, but struck a mine in a previously swept channel and sank rapidly on 29 March. Two crewmen were killed and some others wounded. The ship was later refloated and sold at auction at New Orleans 22 November 1867, along with three ex-Confederate ships, for $20,467.|$|E

5|$|In 1914 discussions began toward finding <b>more</b> <b>permanent</b> homes, {{both for}} Bruce's {{collection}} and, {{following the death}} that year of oceanographer Sir John Murray, for the specimens and library of the Challenger expedition. Bruce proposed that a new centre should be created as a memorial to Murray. There was unanimous agreement to proceed, but the project was curtailed by the outbreak of war, and not revived. The Scottish Oceanographical Laboratory continued until 1919, when Bruce, in poor health, was forced to close it, dispersing its contents to the Royal Scottish Museum, the Royal Scottish Geographical Society (RSGS), and the University of Edinburgh.|$|E

Since then, as of August 2016, Rabbi Jeffrey Kurtz-Lendner became the rabbi of the synagogue.|$|E
5|$|Krasnyi Kavkaz {{continued}} to ferry reinforcements into Sevastopol. During the Kerch-Feodosiya Operation the ship sailed {{into the harbor}} of Feodosiya on 29 December 1941, landed reinforcements, and provided gunfire support for Soviet troops already ashore. In early January 1942, she was severely damaged by German dive bombers. She made it to Novorossiysk, escorted by the destroyer Sposobnyi, where she was patched up enough to make to Poti where <b>more</b> <b>permanent</b> repairs could be made. These took until October 1942 and the opportunity was taken to reinforce her anti-aircraft armament.|$|E

5|$|Lion, Princess Royal and {{the rest}} of the battlecruisers reached Rosyth on the morning of 2 June where Lion began repairs that lasted until 19 July. The remains of 'Q' turret were removed during this period and not {{replaced}} until a visit to Armstrong Whitworth at Elswick that lasted from 6 to 23 September. Princess Royal began repairs that lasted until 10 June. She sailed later that day for Devonport Royal Dockyard where <b>more</b> <b>permanent</b> repairs were made and was back at Rosyth by 21 July.|$|E

Marquis was given a two-room cabin; he lived in one room, and the other was used to display the collection. The camp planned to build a gift shop and Marquis' museum was expected to attract customers to it.|$|E

5|$|Sigismund II's childlessness added {{urgency to}} the idea of turning the {{personal}} union between Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania into a <b>more</b> <b>permanent</b> and tighter relationship; it was also a priority for the execution movement. Lithuania's laws were codified and reforms enacted in 1529, 1557, 1565–1566 and 1588, gradually making its social, legal and economic system similar to that of Poland, with the expanding role of the middle and lower nobility. Fighting wars with Moscow under Ivan IV and the threat perceived from that direction provided additional motivation for the real union for both Poland and Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|This working {{definition}} {{has since}} been widely used by astronomers when publishing discoveries of exoplanets in academic journals. Although temporary, it remains an effective working definition until a <b>more</b> <b>permanent</b> one is formally adopted. It {{does not address the}} dispute over the lower mass limit, and so it steered clear of the controversy regarding objects within the Solar System. This definition also makes no comment on the planetary status of objects orbiting brown dwarfs, such as 2M1207b.|$|E
5|$|After Janet passed Barbados, {{the island}} was {{declared}} a state of emergency. Relief workers on Barbados helped to clean up debris scattered by the strong winds on highways, and the local government made requests for food and construction materials. The extensive damaged caused by Janet on the island to low-income households led the passage of the 1955Housing Act, which created the National Housing Authority (NHA) in 1956. The NHA was responsible for the acquisition of lands on which houses could be built with stronger and <b>more</b> <b>permanent</b> materials, which was thought to minimize maintenance costs and hurricane-related damage. The newly founded organization quickly worked to rebuild homes after the hurricane struck.|$|E

5|$|By 1967, Ballard {{would not}} show up for {{recording}} dates, or would arrive at shows too inebriated to perform. For some early 1967 shows, she was replaced by Marlene Barrow. Looking for a <b>more</b> <b>permanent</b> replacement, Gordy once again thought of Barbara Randolph, possibly believing that Randolph could be groomed as lead singer for the group once {{it was decided to}} take Ross solo. However, Ross did not receive Randolph well. In April 1967, Gordy then contacted Cindy Birdsong, a member of Patti LaBelle & the Blue Belles who superficially resembled Ballard, with plans to bring her in as Ballard's replacement. He made his plans clear to Ballard and her group mates at a mid-April meeting, and Birdsong was brought in to begin rehearsals. Gordy did not fire Ballard outright at that time, asking Ballard instead to quit on her own.|$|E
5|$|Crickets are {{relatively}} defenceless, soft-bodied insects. Most species are nocturnal {{and spend the}} day hidden in cracks, under bark, inside curling leaves, under stones or fallen logs, in leaf litter, or in {{the cracks in the}} ground that develop in dry weather. Some excavate their own shallow holes in rotting wood or underground and fold in their antennae to conceal their presence. Some of these burrows are temporary shelters, used for a single day, but others serve as <b>more</b> <b>permanent</b> residences and places for mating and laying eggs. Crickets burrow by loosening the soil with the mandibles and then carrying it with the limbs, flicking it backwards with the hind legs or pushing it with the head.|$|E
5|$|Egbert's conquests {{brought him}} wealth {{far greater than}} his {{predecessors}} had enjoyed, and enabled him to purchase the support which secured the West Saxon throne for his descendants. The stability brought by the dynastic succession of Egbert and Æthelwulf led to an expansion of commercial and agrarian resources, and to an expansion of royal income. The wealth of the West Saxon kings was also increased by the agreement in 838–39 with Archbishop Ceolnoth for the previously independent West Saxon minsters to accept the king as their secular lord in return for his protection. However, there was no certainty that the hegemony of Wessex would prove <b>more</b> <b>permanent</b> than that of Mercia.|$|E
