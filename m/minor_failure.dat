30|$|In {{addition}} to above discussion, we have considered {{two kinds of}} failures for each subsystem, which are major and <b>minor.</b> Major <b>failures</b> are those in which the system shows complete breakdown while the <b>minor</b> <b>failures</b> are those which can be repaired during working conditions (reduced state). Now, we proceed with each system description and its subsystem. The subsystems A, B, C, D, F, F, I, J, and M are subject to major failure while C, E, G, and K are subject to both major and <b>minor</b> <b>failures.</b> Subsystems L, N, and O are considered to have no failure. Next, the state space of stochastic process for both systems is described in a diagrammatic form, known as transition diagram.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a general stochastic model {{to analyze the}} life cycle cost of an engineering system that is affected by <b>minor</b> but repairable <b>failures</b> interrupting the operation and a major failure {{that would require the}} replacement or renewal of the failed system. It is commonly observed that the frequency of <b>minor</b> <b>failures</b> increases with aging of the system due to cumulative effect of operational wear and tear. At the same time, system’s vulnerability to major failures also increases with aging. The paper {{presents a}} composite stochastic process model in which the <b>minor</b> <b>failures</b> are modeled as a non-homogeneous Poisson process and the occurrences of major failure as a renewal process. The paper presents the derivation of the renewal equation for the expected cost. The age replacement policy is formulated to minimize the life cycle cost via a preventive replacement of the system.

The system experiences two kinds of shocks: a type I shock causes a random amount of damage to the system leading to a serious failure when the total damage exceeds a failure level; or a type II shock causes the system into <b>minor</b> <b>failure</b> which can be corrected by minimal repair. When a <b>minor</b> <b>failure</b> occurs, the repair cost will be evaluated and minimal repair is executed if the accumulated repair cost is less than a predetermined limit L.

In order to assess the performance of the proposed maintenance policy and to minimize the long-term expected cost per unit time, a mathematical model for the maintained system cost is derived. By minimizing that cost, the optimal number n * is also verified finite and unique under certain conditions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{introduce}} a cyclic renewal process {{as an extension of}} an alter-nating renewal process, where each of underlying i. i. d. nonnegative random increments is composed of multiple stages, i. e.

40|$|Abstract A cyclic {{renewal process}} is {{considered}} {{as an extension}} of an alternating renewal process, where each of the underlying independently and identically distributed (i. i. d.) nonnegative random increments is composed of multiple stages. Such a process may be appropriate for analyzing optimal preventive mainte-nance policies for production management, where a pair of two stages representing an uptime until a <b>minor</b> <b>failure</b> and the subsequent minimal repair time would be repeated until it is decided to conduct a complete overhaul. In order to address economic problems in such applications, we also introduce a reward process with jumps dened on the cyclic renewal process. When the system is running in stage j, the prot grows linearly at the rate of (j). Upon a <b>minor</b> <b>failure,</b> the subsequent minimal repair in stage (j + 1) incurs the linear cost at the rate of (j + 1). In addition, the xed cost may be imposed whenever either a minimal repair or a complete overhaul takes place, resulting in jumps of the reward process. The problem is then to determine when to conduct a complete overhaul so as to maximize the total reward in the time inter-val (0; T]. A multivariate Markov process generated from both the cyclic renewal process and the reward process is studied extensively, yielding various new transform results explicitly and deriving their asymp-totic expansions. These results are used to numerically explore optimal preventive maintenance policies for production management...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine <b>minor</b> service <b>failures</b> in UK banking and {{consider}} the impact that satisfaction with service recovery has on customer intentions to continue their custom and make recommendations, used as measures of loyalty behaviours. Design/methodology/approach – Data were gathered on customer satisfaction with service recovery attempts, intended loyalty behaviours and the sources of service failures were gathered by means of an on-line survey from approximately 2, 000 respondents. Findings – Few customers who complained about <b>minor</b> service <b>failures</b> report that they were very satisfied with the service recovery. Weak service recovery influenced customer intentions about continued custom and recommendation. <b>Minor</b> <b>failures</b> in account management and bank charges are shown to have a marked effect on intended loyalty behaviours.

The optimal schedule of preventive replacement that minimizes the mean cost rate is presented theoretically and determined numerically.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a replacement model with age-dependent failure type {{based on a}} cumulative repair-cost limit policy, whose concept uses the information of all repair costs {{to decide whether the}} system is repaired or replaced. As failures occur, the system experiences one of the two types of failures: a type-I failure (minor), rectified by a minimal repair; or a type-II failure (catastrophic) that calls for a replacement. A critical type-I failure means a <b>minor</b> <b>failure</b> at which the accumulated repair cost exceeds the pre-determined limit for the first time. The system is replaced at the nth type-I failure, or at a critical type-I failure, or at first type-II failure, whichever occurs first.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{investigate}} {{failures in}} patient safety for patients undergoing vascular and endovascular procedures to guide future quality and safety interventions. DesignSingle centre prospective observational study. Methods 66 procedures (17 thoracoabdominal and 23 abdominal aortic aneurysms, 4 carotid and 22 limb procedures) were observed prospectively over a 9 -month period (251  h operating time) by two trained observers. Event logs were recorded for each procedure. Two blinded experts identified and independently categorised failures into 22 types (using a validated category tool) and severity (5 -point scale). Data are expressed as median (range). Statistical {{analysis was performed}} using Mann–Whitney U, Kruskal–Wallis and Spearman’s Rank tests. Results 1145 failures were identified with good inter-assessor reliability (Cronbach’s alpha 0. 844). The commonest failure types related to equipment (including unavailability, configuration and other failures) (269 / 1145 [23. 5 %]) and communication (240 / 1145 [21. 0 %]). A comparatively lower number of technical and psychomotor failures were identified (103 [9. 0 %]). The number of failures correlated with procedure duration (rho =  0. 695, p <  0. 001) but not anatomical site of the procedure or pathology of the disease process. Failure rate was higher in patients undergoing combined surgical/endovascular procedures compared to open surgery (median 5. 7 /h [IQR 4. 2 – 8. 1] vs 3. 0 /h [2. 5 – 3. 5]; p <  0. 001). The severity of failures was similar (1. 5 / 5 [1 – 2] vs 1 / 5 [1 – 2] respectively; p =  0. 095). For combined procedures, failure rates were significantly higher during the endovascular phase (9. 6 /h [7. 5 – 13. 7]) compared to the non-endovascular phase (3. 0 /h [1. 0 – 5. 0]; p <  0. 001). ConclusionsFailures in patient safety are common during complex arterial procedures. Few failures were severe, although <b>minor</b> <b>failures</b> during critical stages and accumulation of multiple <b>minor</b> <b>failures</b> may potentially be important. Failures occurred especially during the endovascular phase and were often related to equipment or communication aspects.

We assume that the equipment has two types of failure: minor and catastrophic.

It is assumed that equipment is maintained at no charge to the consumer during the warranty period, whereas the consumer is fully charged for any maintenance on failures after the extended warranty expires. We formulate the expected life cycle cost of the equipment under a general failure time distribution, and then for special cases we prove that the optimal replacement and extended warranty policies exists where the expected life cycle cost per unit time is minimised.
