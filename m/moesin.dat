50|$|Human merlin is coded by {{the gene}} NF2 in Chromosome 22. Mouse merlin gene {{is located on}} {{chromosome}} 11 and rat merlin gene on chromosome 17. Fruit fly merlin gene (symbol Mer) is located on chromosome 1 and shares 58% similarity to its human homologue.Other merlin-like genes are known {{from a wide range}} of animals, and the derivation of merlin is thought to be in early metazoa. Merlin is a member of the ERM family of proteins including ezrin, <b>moesin,</b> and radixin, which are in the protein 4.1 superfamily of proteins. Merlin is also known as schwannomin, a name derived from the most common type of tumor in the NF2 patient phenotype, the schwannoma.|$|E
50|$|Ezrin, <b>moesin,</b> and radixin {{are highly}} related {{proteins}} (ERM protein family), {{but the other}} proteins in which the FERM domain is found do not share any region of similarity outside of this domain. ERM proteins are made of three domains, the FERM domain, a central helical domain and a C-terminal tail domain, which binds F-actin. The amino-acid sequence of the FERM domain is highly conserved among ERM proteins and is responsible for membrane association by direct binding to the cytoplasmic domain or tail of integral membrane proteins. ERM proteins are regulated by an intramolecular association of the FERM and C-terminal tail domains that masks their binding sites for other molecules. For cytoskeleton-membrane cross-linking, the dormant molecules becomes activated and the FERM domain attaches to the membrane by binding specific membrane proteins, while the last 34 residues of the tail bind actin filaments. Aside from binding to membranes, the activated FERM domain of ERM proteins can also bind the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor of Rho GTPase (RhoDGI), which suggests {{that in addition to}} functioning as a cross-linker, ERM proteins may influence Rho signalling pathways. The crystal structure of the FERM domain reveals that it is composed of three structural modules (F1, F2, and F3) that together form a compact clover-shaped structure. The N-terminal module is ubiquitin-like. The C-terminal module is a PH-like domain.|$|E
40|$|<b>Moesin</b> is a 78 -kDa protein {{with diverse}} {{functions}} in linking the cytoskeleton to the membrane while controlling cell shape, adhesion, locomotion, and signaling. The {{aim of this}} study was to characterize the expression and localization of <b>moesin</b> in mononuclear phagocytes by using confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting and to analyze the function of <b>moesin</b> as a lipopolysaccharide receptor, utilizing an antisense oligonucleotide approach to knock down the <b>moesin</b> gene. Results revealed that <b>moesin</b> is expressed on the surface of monocytes/macrophages and surface expression is increased after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. The total protein mass of <b>moesin</b> is increased in monocytes after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Immunoprecipitation showed that <b>moesin</b> coprecipitates with TLR 4, a well-known lipopolysaccharide receptor, suggesting an early role of <b>moesin</b> in the formation of the initiation complex for lipopolysaccharide signaling. Two antisense and two control sense oligonucleotides were synthesized and introduced every 4 h for 48 h in adherent macrophage-like cells. Cells were then stimulated with lipopolysaccharide for 4 h, and the supernatants were assayed for tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) production. Cell lysates were assayed for <b>moesin</b> expression by Western blotting immediately after the 48 -h treatment period and also after 116 h of recovery to assess the return of <b>moesin</b> expression and function. <b>Moesin</b> gene expression was completely suppressed after 48 h of incubation with antisense oligonucleotides. The antisense elimination of <b>moesin</b> gene expression led to a significant reduction of lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-α secretion. Restoration of <b>moesin</b> gene expression led to restoration of TNF-α production. These data suggest an important role for <b>moesin</b> in lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-α production, highlighting its importance in lipopolysaccharide-mediated signal transduction...|$|E
40|$|<b>Moesin</b> is a cytoskeletal adaptor {{protein that}} plays an {{important}} role in modification of the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of dendritic spines, which may be crucial to long-term potentiation. <b>Moesin</b> has also been found to be overexpressed in brains affected by Alzheimer’s disease. Despite being identified as a potential memory gene and linked to several neurological diseases, its role in memory has not been evaluated. The role of <b>Moesin</b> in the Drosophila melanogaster brain was investigated by characterizing the impact of modulating <b>Moesin</b> expression on several aspects of development and behavior. <b>Moesin</b> is involved in both brain and eye development. Knockdown and overexpression of <b>Moesin</b> led to defects in the development of the mushroom body, a brain structure critical for memory formation and recall. Further, knockdown of <b>Moesin</b> throughout development resulted in a significant deficit in long-term memory. Additionally, knockdown of <b>Moesin</b> restricted to adulthood also resulted in a significant deficit in long-term memory, which suggests that <b>Moesin</b> also has a non-developmental role in memory. Further, this requirement for <b>Moesin</b> in long-term memory was traced to the alpha/beta and gamma neurons of the mushroom body. Through the use of a phosphomimetic <b>Moesin</b> mutant that mimics the phosphorylated, activated form of <b>Moesin,</b> the regulation of <b>Moesin</b> in the Drosophila brain was analyzed. Expression of this mutant in neurons disrupted photoreceptor development in the Drosophila eye and a novel sensorimotor phenotype attributed to its expression in the brain was identified resulting in a defect in stereotypical climbing behavior.

40|$|Dysregulation {{of protein}} expression, in {{particular}} expression of proto-oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes whose function play key roles in cell growth, adhesion and migration, are hallmarks of human malignancies. Transmembrane and immunoglobulin-containing domain 1 (TMIGD 1) was recently discovered as a {{cell adhesion molecule}} (CAM) that {{plays an important role}} in epithelial cell function by regulating epithelial cell polarity and adhesion. The extracellular domain of TMIGD 1 contains two Ig domains that are involved in cell-cell interaction, followed by a transmembrane region and short cytoplasmic domain with potential to relay signal transduction. Our further investigation demonstrated TMIGD 1 is downregulated in human colon cancer, suggesting a potentially important role for TMIGD 1 in the regulation colorectal cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms of TMIGD 1 -mediated signal transduction, which could relay its function in epithelial cells, are not known. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis, we have identified <b>moesin</b> as a possible TMIGD 1 binding protein. <b>Moesin,</b> a member of the Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin (ERM) family of proteins, is upregulated in human tumors. <b>Moesin</b> stimulates cell migration, tumor invasion, adherence and modulates cytoskeletal actin assembly. Similar to other ERM family proteins, <b>moesin</b> contains an N-terminal FERM domain, which binds to transmembrane proteins, and a C-terminal C-ERMAD domain, which binds F-actin. The overall goal of this study was to determine the binding of <b>moesin</b> with TMIGD 1 and the specific domain involved in mediating the binding of <b>moesin</b> with TMIGD 1. Our study in vitro and in vivo binding assays demonstrate that <b>moesin</b> interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of TMIGD 1 via its FERM domain. Moreover, we demonstrate TMIGD 1 interaction with <b>moesin</b> inhibits phosphorylation of <b>moesin,</b> indicating that perhaps TMIGD 1 inhibits tumor cell migration through inhibition of phosphorylation of <b>moesin.</b> Additionally, TMIGD 1 alters cellular localization of <b>moesin,</b> suggesting that altered cellular localization by TMIGD 1 could account for inhibition of phosphorylation of <b>moesin.</b> We propose that TMIGD 1 sequesters <b>moesin</b> near the cell membrane, preventing its interaction with PIP 2, which is required for its phosphorylation and hence inhibits <b>moesin</b> activation. Altogether, the data presented in this work identifies <b>moesin</b> as a key signaling component of TMIGD 1. <b>Moesin</b> directly interacts with TMIGD 1 via its FERM domain. Recruitment of <b>moesin</b> to TMIGD 1 blocks phosphorylation of <b>moesin,</b> suggesting that TMIGD 1 exerts its effect in tumor cells in part by inhibition of <b>moesin</b> activation. 2018 - 07 - 11 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{signalling}} {{activities of}} Merlin and <b>Moesin,</b> two closely related {{members of the}} protein 4. 1 Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin family, are regulated by conformational changes. These changes are regulated in turn by phosphorylation. The same sterile 20 kinase-Slik co-regulates Merlin or <b>Moesin</b> activity whereby phosphorylation inactivates Merlin, but activates <b>Moesin.</b> Thus, the corresponding coordinate activation of Merlin and inactivation of <b>Moesin</b> would require coordinated phosphatase activity. We find that Drosophila melanogaster protein phosphatase type 1 β (flapwing) fulfils this role, co-regulating dephosphorylation and altered activity of both Merlin and <b>Moesin.</b> Merlin or <b>Moesin</b> are detected in a complex with Flapwing both in-vitro and in-vivo. Directed changes in flapwing expression result in altered phosphorylation of both Merlin and <b>Moesin.</b> These changes in the levels of Merlin and <b>Moesin</b> phosphorylation following reduction of flapwing expression are associated with concomitant defects in epithelial integrity and increase in apoptosis in developing tissues such as wing imaginal discs. Functionally, the defects can be partially recapitulated by over expression of proteins that mimic constitutively phosphorylated or unphosphorylated Merlin or <b>Moesin.</b> Our results suggest that changes in the phosphorylation levels of Merlin and <b>Moesin</b> lead to changes in epithelial organization...|$|E

40|$|International audienceMoesin, {{a protein}} of the ezrin, radixin, and <b>moesin</b> family, which links the plasma {{membrane}} to the cytoskeleton, {{is involved in}} multiple physiological and pathological processes, including viral budding and infection. Its interaction with the plasma membrane occurs via a key phosphoinositide, the phosphatidyl(4, 5) inositol-bisphosphate (PIP 2), and phosphorylation of residue T 558, which {{has been shown to}} contribute, in cellulo, to a conformationally open protein. We study the impact of a double phosphomimetic mutation of <b>moesin</b> (T 235 D, T 558 D), which mimics the phosphorylation state of the protein, on protein/PIP 2 /microtubule interactions. Analytical ultracentrifugation in the micromolar range showed <b>moesin</b> in the monomer and dimer forms, with wild-type (WT) <b>moesin</b> containing a slightly larger fraction (∼ 30 %) of dimers than DD <b>moesin</b> (10 - 20 %). Only DD <b>moesin</b> was responsive to PIP 2 in its micellar form. Quantitative cosedimentation assays using large unilamellar vesicles and quartz crystal microbalance on supported lipid bilayers containing PIP 2 reveal a specific cooperative interaction for DD <b>moesin</b> with an ability to bind two PIP 2 molecules simultaneously, whereas WT <b>moesin</b> was able to bind only one. In addition, DD <b>moesin</b> could subsequently interact with microtubules, whereas WT <b>moesin</b> was unable to do so. Altogether, our results point to an important role of these two phosphorylation sites in the opening of moesin: since DD <b>moesin</b> is intrinsically in a more open conformation than WT <b>moesin,</b> this intermolecular interaction is reinforced by its binding to PIP 2. We also highlight important differences between <b>moesin</b> and ezrin, which appear to be finely regulated and to exhibit distinct molecular behaviors...|$|E

Among the interacting proteins we identified <b>moesin,</b> a protein belonging to ERM (Ezrin, Radixin, <b>Moesin)</b> family.

40|$|The small GTPase Rho is {{believed}} to regulate the actin cytoskeleton and cell adhesion through its specific targets. We previously identified the Rho targets: protein kinase N, Rho-associated kinase (Rho- kinase), and the myosin-binding subunit (MBS) of myosin phosphatase. We found that in MDCK epithelial cells, MBS accumulated at the tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA) -induced membrane ruffling area, where <b>moesin,</b> {{a member of the}} ERM (ezrin, radixin, and <b>moesin)</b> family, was localized. Neither membrane ruffling nor an accumulation of <b>moesin</b> and MBS at the free-end plasma membrane was induced when MDCK cells were stimulated with TPA after the microinjection of C 3, which ADP-ribosylates and inactivates Rho. MBS was colocalized with <b>moesin</b> at the cell–cell contact sites in MDCK cells. We also found that <b>moesin</b> was coimmunoprecipitated with MBS from MDCK cells. Recombinant MBS interacted with the amino-terminal domains of <b>moesin</b> and ezrin.

40|$|This study {{provides}} {{the first evidence}} that actin reorganization during AQP 2 vesicular trafficking to the plasma membrane requires the functional involvement of ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin) proteins cross-linking actin filaments with plasma membrane proteins.

Introduction of a peptide reproducing a short sequence of <b>moesin</b> within the binding site for F-actin induced all the key effects of forskolin stimulation, including a decrease in F-actin, translocation of endogenous <b>moesin,</b> and AQP 2 translocation. A straightforward explanation for these effects is the ability of the peptide to uncouple <b>moesin</b> from its putative effector.
