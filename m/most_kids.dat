[...] "I was an easy target to be picked on, and that started in kindergarten," [...] he said. [...] "It was the kind of bullying that <b>most</b> <b>kids</b> who were bullied experienced [...] When you get pushed every day, and when you are ostracized not once, not twice, but years in and out, your perception of reality is distorted [...] These things really do warp your understanding and your perception of humanity in some almost irrevocable way," [...] he said.|$|E

New York Daily News writer Jim Farber commented on his lyrical observations, [...] "Nas focuses on linear scenarios and on human motivations ... "unlike many hard rappers, Nas' tales of ghetto horror are not covert boasts but expressions of true fear".

[...] Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post felt that the film [...] "is technically superb and quite enjoyable {{as long as you}} don't bang your head against the plot, which will cause hot flashes, premature aging and fallen arches." [...] According to Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer, the film is [...] "not so dark or scary as to keep <b>most</b> <b>kids</b> away" [...] and it [...] "has a cool, noirish sheen.

500|$|Stead {{finds that}} kids today {{are much less}} {{independent}} since her childhood. She wrote, [...] "rom age nine, my friends and I were on the streets, walking home, going to each other's houses, going to the store. I really {{wanted to write about}} that: the independence that's a little bit scary but also a really positive thing in a lot of ways. And I'm not sure that <b>most</b> <b>kids</b> have that today". Throughout the novel, Miranda and her friends often walk around town without any adults. They are even found working in a sandwich store at lunch and walking home from school while trying to avoid the laughing man. While writing the novel, Stead hoped to show her sons the time period in which she lived, [...] "send them on a little time-travel journey of their own". Laura Miller of The New Yorker found that this lack of independence in today's youth is mainly {{due to the fact that}} kids now grow up with adults constantly watching them. Miller noted how, despite the lower crime rate in current times, the [...] "characters, middle-class middle school students, routinely walk around the Upper West Side by themselves, a rare freedom in today's city." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{not being}} as {{acclaimed}} as its second season, {{reception of the}} first season was still generally positive. Despite giving the Edifying Ed-Ventures DVD a negative review, IGN's Mike Drucker praised the show, saying: [...] "Every bit {{of the show is}} played for the maximum comic effect, and the interactions between the characters are usually very fun," [...] and particularly praised the season finale, [...] "Avast Ye Eds", saying that it is a [...] "good example of how the animators developed a clever, surreal environment that <b>most</b> <b>kids</b> could probably relate to. They simply go wild and allow regular childhood adventures turn into comedic epics, very over-the-top, but still linked to the way that kids act and react to strange situations." [...] While calling it a [...] "gem" [...] and of [...] "entertaining nature", he criticized the storylines as [...] "repetitive" [...] and said the show [...] "lacks the genius of SpongeBob". Terrence Briggs of Animation World Magazine considered every second of the show [...] "filler" [...] and lamented that the main characters are drawn as [...] "products from the school of acid-trip caricature." [...] After Briggs' review was published, a large number of letters supportive of the show were sent to the magazine, prompting it to [...] "take a second look" [...] at the show.

[...] He graded the songs performed [...] "C−" [...] through to [...] "A−", commending what he deemed [...] "by far the greatest performance of [...] "Ice Ice Baby" [...] ever". The Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson also felt the episode was a return to form. He praised the decision not to [...] "apply meaningless rules to their musical selections", writing: [...] "The freedom to not have to use songs by one artist let the storylines take priority, and not sticking to songs that share a common lyrical theme kept those choices from feeling too forced." [...] Dave Itzkoff of the New York Times recapped the episode positively, describing it as: [...] "pack more camp into an hour's worth of television than <b>most</b> <b>kids</b> will get all summer." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club graded [...] "Bad Reputation" [...] "B+", writing that he: [...] "enjoyed the episode quite a bit, even as [...] found some of it rather messy." [...] Though VanDerWerff felt that not everything in the episode worked, he stated: [...] "the stuff that did reminded me that what I like about the show is its all-out embrace of a crazy mishmash of tones." ...|$|E
500|$|When the {{character}} was announced, he {{was described as}} a hustler who sees everything as an opportunity, and has created several personas since the age of seven to hide his real self. Norwood expanded on this, saying [...] "when he was in school and the register was being read out and it got to his name it would be 'Chubb!' and all the kids in school would start taking the mickey out of it. What he did was create something even more ridiculous to take away from that. He [...] out of himself and took the power away from those that were taking the mickey out of him. [...] For the same reason <b>most</b> <b>kids</b> put on a front, it's to protect himself from the world. He doesn't like his real name so he tried to create something that would get away from that and Fatboy was that creation. The street and the slang stuff is not something that is far away from him, it is still from the area that he lives in. Fatboy was someone he adopted to put a brave face on, to put a mask on himself, to protect Arthur from the world." [...] Before adopting the [...] "Fatboy" [...] persona, he would adopt personas of men he saw on television, and Norwood said Fatboy was [...] "an awkward kind of child". Fatboy comes from a wealthy background, and gets what he wants from his parents, with whom he has a good relationship, but hustles to hide the fact. He often wears clothing brand Ed Hardy, and his speech has, according to Norwood, a [...] "unique rhythm". Norwood is able to make viable changes to the script to make it sound more authentic.|$|E

[...] "So my folks brought me piles of books from the Seattle Public Library," [...] he {{recalled}} in interview, [...] "and it was then I really learned to read and from that time on was voracious — I figure that accident changed my life. At the end of four months, I had read more than <b>most</b> <b>kids</b> do by the time they're eighteen. And I didn't stop." [...] Also during his ten childhood years in Washington, Snyder {{became aware of the}} presence of the Coast Salish people and developed an interest in the Native American peoples in general and their traditional relationship with nature.|$|E

That was the sort of disposition Andy had, and it grew on him. Why, when he came back from Oxford College the time the old man sent for him--what I'm going to tell you about soon--he had a jaw on him like the ram of a battleship. Katie was the kid for my money.
