50|$|The first {{treatment}} application against trypanosomiasis {{was tested}} in 1906, and the compound's use to treat other tropical diseases was researched. The treatment of leishmania with antimony <b>potassium</b> <b>tartrate</b> started in 1913. After {{the introduction of}} antimony (V) containing complexes like sodium stibogluconate and meglumine antimoniate, the use of antimony <b>potassium</b> <b>tartrate</b> was phased out. After British physician John Brian Christopherson's discovery in 1918 that antimony <b>potassium</b> <b>tartrate</b> could cure schistosomiasis, the antimonial drugs became widely used. However, the injection of antimony <b>potassium</b> <b>tartrate</b> had severe side effects such as Adams-Stokes syndrome and therefore alternative substances were under investigation. With the introduction and subsequent larger use of praziquantel in the 1970s, the use of antimony based treatments fell out of use.|$|R

40|$|Cross-resistance between {{cisplatin}} (DDP) and metalloid salts {{in human}} cells was sought {{on the basis}} that mechanisms that mediate metalloid salt cross-resistance in prokaryotes are evolutionarily conserved. Two ovarian and two head and neck carcinoma cell lines selected for DDP resistance were found to be cross-resistant to antimony <b>potassium</b> <b>tartrate,</b> which contains trivalent antimony. The DDP-resistant variant 2008 /A was also cross-resistant to arsenite but not to stibogluconate, which contains pentavalent antimony. A variant selected for resistance to antimony <b>potassium</b> <b>tartrate</b> was cross-resistant to DDP and arsenite. Resistance to antimony <b>potassium</b> <b>tartrate</b> and arsenite was of a similar magnitude (3 - 7 -fold), whereas the level of resistance to DDP was greater (17 -fold), irrespective of whether the cells were selected by exposure to DDP or to antimony <b>potassium</b> <b>tartrate.</b> In the resistant sublines, uptake of [3 H]-dichloro(ethylenediamine) platinum(II) was reduced to 41 - 52 % of control, and a similar deficit was observed in the accumulation of arsenite. We conclude that DDP, antimony <b>potassium</b> <b>tartrate,</b> and arsenite all share a common mechanism of resistance in human cells and that this {{is due in part to}} an accumulation defect...|$|R
