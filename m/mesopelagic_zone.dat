It feeds on bony fishes and squid, and its sizable eyes and dark coloration suggest that it may spend most of its time in the <b>mesopelagic</b> <b>zone.</b> Reproduction is probably viviparous with oophagous embryos like in other mackerel shark species. This shark is caught incidentally by commercial fisheries, though so infrequently that the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) cannot yet determine its conservation status.|$|E
5|$|The {{intrinsic}} green luminescence of the cookiecutter shark is {{the strongest}} known of any shark, and {{has been reported to}} persist for three hours after it has been taken out of water. The ventrally positioned photophores serve to disrupt its silhouette from below by matching the downwelling light, a strategy known as counter-illumination, that is common among bioluminescent organisms of the <b>mesopelagic</b> <b>zone.</b> The individual photophores are set around the denticles and are small enough that they cannot be discerned by the naked eye, suggesting they have evolved to fool animals with high visual acuity and/or at close distances.|$|E

50|$|The ghostly seadevil or soft leftvent angler, Haplophryne mollis, is {{a species}} of {{anglerfish}} in the family Linophrynidae {{and is the only}} species in the genus Haplophryne.

25|$|Below the <b>mesopelagic</b> <b>zone</b> it is pitch dark. This is {{the midnight}} or bathypelagic zone, {{extending}} from 1000 m {{to the bottom}} deep water benthic zone. If the water is exceptionally deep, the pelagic zone below 4000 m is sometimes called the lower midnight or abyssopelagic zone.|$|E
25|$|The {{dominant}} bathypelagic fishes {{are small}} bristlemouth and anglerfish; fangtooth, viperfish, daggertooth and barracudina are also common. These fishes are small, many about 10 centimetres long, and not many longer than 25cm. They {{spend most of}} their time waiting patiently in the water column for prey to appear or to be lured by their phosphors. What little energy is available in the bathypelagic zone filters from above in the form of detritus, faecal material, and the occasional invertebrate or mesopelagic fish. About 20% of the food that has its origins in the epipelagic zone falls down to the <b>mesopelagic</b> <b>zone,</b> but only about 5% filters down to the bathypelagic zone.|$|E

It is thought to inhabit the sunlit epipelagic to dimly lit <b>mesopelagic</b> <b>zones,</b> ranging as deeply as 1000 m below the surface.|$|R
5000|$|Found in the Pacific Ocean from Japan and Baja California to the Bering Sea, it is {{the most}} common species of {{lanternfish}} in the northwestern Pacific, {{and one of the most}} abundant larval fish in the California Current. Like all lanternfish, this is a deep sea species; it spends the day in the ocean's deeper bathypelagic and <b>mesopelagic</b> <b>zones</b> and ascends to or near the ocean's surface during the night.

Contrary to the perception that sunfish spend much of their time basking at the surface, M. mola adults actually spend a large portion of their lives submerged at depths greater than 200 m, occupying both the epipelagic and <b>mesopelagic</b> <b>zones.</b>|$|R

Nighttime captures from relatively shallow depths suggest that this species may make a diel vertical migration, rising from the <b>mesopelagic</b> <b>zone</b> to the epipelagic zone at night to feed. In Brazilian waters, bigeye sand tigers are only captured in spring, hinting at some type of seasonal migratory movement.|$|E
500|$|The stratum of {{the water}} column nearest {{the surface of the}} ocean (sea level) is {{referred}} to as the photic zone. The photic zone can be subdivided into two different vertical regions.

The lower portion of the photic zone, where the light intensity is insufficient for photosynthesis, is called the dysphotic zone (dysphotic means [...] "poorly lit" [...] in Greek). The dysphotic zone is also referred to as the <b>mesopelagic</b> <b>zone,</b> or the twilight zone.

50|$|Marine {{animals of}} the <b>mesopelagic</b> (mid-water) <b>zone</b> tend to appear dark against the bright water surface when seen from below.

Counter-illumination differs from countershading, which uses only pigments such as melanin to reduce the appearance of shadows. It {{is one of the}} dominant types of aquatic camouflage, along with transparency and silvering. All three methods make animals in open water resemble their environment.|$|R

40|$|Recent global {{synthetic}} analyses {{have revealed}} that marine taxonomic inventories are far from complete, nowhere {{more so than in}} the deep-pelagic ocean. At over a billion km 3, it is the largest biome on Earth, yet {{only a tiny fraction of}} the biogeographic records include the bathypelagic fauna. This data gap served as the impetus for recent deepwater surveys, many of which have altered our perceptions of pelagic ecosystems. Here we examine data from four deep-pelagic (0 - 5000 + m) sampling programs in the Atlantic (60 °N- 25 °S) in order to assess the character of bathypelagic fish communities with respect to faunal distinctiveness and ecological connectivity. Regions studied include the Gulf of Mexico, Sargasso 702 Sea, eastern North/South Atlantic, and mid-North Atlantic. Quantitative analyses give contrasting pictures with respect to faunal composition and ecosystem operation. The discreteness of the bathypelagic zone is exhibited faunistically by the suite of ―holobathypelagic‖ species found only below 1000 m, most of which are highly modified morphologically. Geometric abundance class analyses reveal that the character of relative species abundance distributions between the meso- and bathypelagic zones is fundamentally dissimilar; the former exhibit a much higher proportion of common species, while the latter exhibit a much higher percentage of rarer species. From a community energetics perspective, however, the bathy- and <b>mesopelagic</b> <b>zones</b> are highly interconnected. Approximately 70...|$|R

Covariations in the abundances of VLPs with heterotrophic and autotrophic picoplankton, and their correlation (i. e. r(2) = 0. 63 and 0. 52, respectively) suggested a strong host dependence in the epi-and <b>mesopelagic</b> <b>zones.</b> In the bathypelagic zone, only abiotic factors significantly influenced VLPs abundance variation (r(2) = 0. 12).
