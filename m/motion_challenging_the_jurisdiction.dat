40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the legitimacy {{discourse of the}} ad-hoc International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, by focusing on a particular case study: the Interlocutory <b>Motion</b> <b>challenging</b> <b>the</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of the Tribunal in the Dusko Tadi 6 case. This, the first ever International Criminal Tribunal established by the United Nations Security Council, faced in the initial proceedings with the first indictee {{to be present in}} the Chambers a challenge as to the lawfulness of its own establishment, and therefore as to its legitimacy. The lack of historical precedents for this novel jurisdiction, and the context of the more multicultural-driven international relations of the 1990 s, that is, because of the collapse of the superpowers and the temporary suspension of the logic of a bipolar world, were all expected to validate a complex discourse of legitimacy, namely, through recourse to extra-legal references. In fact, the acceptance, and therefore the legitimacy, of the new jurisdiction depended on the recognition of a shared historical, cultural and political context, or, at least, of recognizable politicocultural references beyond the legalistic self-contained judicial speech. After extensively reviewing the initial materials of the challenge presented before the court, the thesis focuses its research on the Tribunal's Decisions, both at Trial and Appeal levels, identifying the attempts to break a self-referential legal discourse. The uncertainty of the historical moment, together with the hesitation on the use of politico-cultural references {{on the part of the}} Tribunal, sustains the conclusion of this thesis that no coherent legitimacy discourse is here attained...|$|E

5000|$|The Swiss Federal Tribunal (SFT) {{has decided}} not to {{entertain}} the appeal filed by the players against the CAS award of 11 January 2016 imposing a 2-year ban on each player following an anti-doping rule violation. The SFT determined that since the players did not formally <b>challenge</b> <b>the</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of CAS during the arbitration procedure and accepted the application of the CAS Rules (including the rule providing for a de novo hearing, i.e. for a procedure allowing the CAS to conduct a full review of the case), they had lost their right to <b>challenge</b> <b>the</b> CAS <b>jurisdiction</b> in appeal. <b>The</b> SFT added that, even if <b>the</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of CAS had been properly <b>challenged</b> by <b>the</b> players, CAS <b>jurisdiction</b> in this matter would have been confirmed and the appeal would have been dismissed.

50|$|At {{a further}} hearing on 2 December, James withdrew his {{suggestion}} of an augmented assize court {{and gave the}} opinion that the court should sit as the Queen's Bench Divisional Court; this should only have allowed two or three judges, not the five who eventually sat.

Although the defence teams had initially proposed calling 43 witnesses to the confirmation of charges hearings the chamber instructed them to present just two witnesses each at the confirmation hearings, which they did.

On November 24, 2007, employees voted to unionize: 60 percent were in favor and 40 percent were against. The Foxwood dealers cast 1,289 ballots for the union, 852 against representation, with challenges to 36 additional ballots. Approximately 2,700 dealers and dual-rate dealers were eligible to vote in the election.|$|R

Judge Lee denied the team's summary judgment <b>motions</b> <b>challenging</b> <b>the</b> constitutionality of the Lanham Act and granted the Blackhorse Defendants' summary judgment motions, finding that [...] "the evidence before the Court supports the legal conclusion that...the Redskin Marks consisted of matter that 'may disparage' a substantial composite of Native Americans."

50|$|Except {{for some}} interim measures, {{there is very}} little scope for {{judicial}} intervention in the arbitration process. The arbitration tribunal has jurisdiction over its own jurisdiction. Thus, if a party wants to <b>challenge</b> <b>the</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of <b>the</b> arbitration tribunal, it can do so only before the tribunal itself. If the tribunal rejects the request, there is little the party can do except to approach a court after the tribunal makes an award. Section 34 provides certain grounds upon which a party can appeal to the principal civil court of original jurisdiction for setting aside the award.|$|R
2500|$|On 1 February, Dion tabled a <b>motion</b> <b>challenging</b> <b>the</b> Conservatives {{to reaffirm}} Canada's {{commitment}} to the Kyoto Protocol, attempting to capitalize on a 2002 letter in which Prime Minister Harper described the Accord as a [...] "socialist scheme" [...] {{that is based on}} [...] "tentative and contradictory scientific evidence" [...] and designed to suck money out of rich countries. Tory environment minister John Baird responded by blaming the Liberals for what he described as a [...] "shameful record over 13 years of inaction on the environment," [...] while Stephen Harper said that his government would [...] "stabilize emissions."

5000|$|In 1165, in {{the town}} of Lombers, the Bishop of Albi {{attended}} by both clerics and members of the nobility, including Constance the wife of Raymond V, interrogated and debated with members of an alleged heretical sect. Calling themselves [...] "Good Men", this group held beliefs similar to those of Henry of Lausanne and Peter of Bruys as well as indicating Cathar influence. While the Good Men declined to respond to a number of questions about their beliefs, they told the bishop that they did not accept the Old Testament, and that their reading of the New Testament persuaded them that they should not take oaths. They further <b>challenged</b> <b>the</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of <b>the</b> bishop.|$|R
2500|$|It is {{noteworthy}} that the United States, the defaulting party, was the only member that put forward arguments against {{the validity of the}} judgment of the court, arguing that it passed a decision that it [...] "had neither <b>the</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> nor <b>the</b> competence to render."

On January 20, 2006, Aref’s lawyers filed a <b>motion</b> <b>challenging</b> <b>the</b> case against Aref as tainted by the illegality of the NSA program-the motion stated, “The government engaged in illegal electronic surveillance of thousands of US persons, including Yassin Aref, then instigated a sting operation to attempt to entrap Mr. Aref into supporting a non-existent terrorist plot, then dared to claim that the illegal NSA operation was justified {{because it was the only}} way to catch Mr. Aref!” ...|$|R
50|$|It was Wentworth who in 1638 {{instructed}} Osbaldeston {{to bring}} proceedings for quo warranto (i.e. {{a claim that}} a person or body is asserting a legal jurisdiction it does not possess) against those corporations in Munster which <b>challenged</b> <b>the</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of <b>the</b> central Court of Admiralty; this was apparently {{at the request of}} Dr Alan Cooke, the Irish Admiralty judge. In 1639 the quo warranto campaign was extended into an attack on all local landowners who claimed the right to hold local Admiralty courts. The campaign was not entirely successful: the Court of Exchequer (Ireland) ruled that Richard Talbot of Malahide Castle (ancestor of Baron Talbot de Malahide) had the right to hold an admiralty court for the port of Malahide. The campaign seems to have petered out after Osbaldeston's death.|$|R
50|$|Iron Crow v. Oglala Sioux Tribe of Pine Ridge Reservation, 231 F.2d 89 (8th Cir.1956), was a {{case where}} <b>the</b> plaintiffs <b>challenged</b> <b>the</b> {{authority}} of Indian tribal courts; the matter involving both adultery and tax assessment was heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Two of the plaintiffs, both enrolled members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, Marie Little Finger and David Black Cat were tried and convicted in the Oglala Sioux Tribal court {{of the crime of}} adultery, under the Revised Code of the Oglala Sioux Tribe. The third plaintiff in the case Thomas Iron Crow, also an enrolled member of the Oglala Sioux Tribe <b>challenged</b> <b>the</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of <b>the</b> tribal court to enforce the collection of a tax assessed against parties who were none-members of the tribe who leased grazing rights from him on his allocated land on the reservation.|$|R

40|$|Capitalism is an {{economic}} system inherently contradictory and unstable, with variations {{that take place in}} time and space. After the collapse of socialism, the capital assumed an even wider civilizing mission, spreading its gains and contradictions globally. This article aims to explain the changes in contemporary capitalism from Fordism to the crisis of 2008, relating them to the social and economic inequalities. The recent crisis - which originated in the real estate industry (subprime) in the United States and spread to the world financial markets, plunging the world into another wave of recession - seems to point to a pessimistic scenario in the future. However, some mechanisms present in modern democracies led to a varied set of <b>motions,</b> <b>challenging</b> <b>the</b> current economic and social order on a global scale - suggesting the possibility of alternative scenarios...|$|R
50|$|The Queen's Bench Division sat on 4 December under Lord Chief Justice Lord Coleridge. James {{appeared}} for the prosecution, leading Charles and Danckwerts. At {{the beginning}} of the hearing, the report of the Exeter trial was read out, at some length, in its entirety. This allowed Collins to submit that the special verdict had been altered. As much was ultimately admitted and it was eventually agreed that it was best that the special verdict be restored to the version agreed by the jury. Collins' attempt to <b>challenge</b> <b>the</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of <b>the</b> court was rejected by the judges. Collins then submitted that the court was not competent to return a verdict as the Exeter jury had not given a conditional verdict asserting that the jury would find in accordance with the judge's ruling. Though this troubled the judges, especially Grove, the point was eventually dismissed as one of form only.|$|R
50|$|The Federal Government has {{consistently}} <b>challenged</b> <b>the</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of <b>the</b> Canadian Human Rights Act {{to deal with}} the complaint. Canada was unsuccessful in trying to convince the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the vetting body for complaints filed under the CHRA) to dismiss the complaint and it was referred for a full hearing by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal in 2008. The Federal Government then tried to have the case dismissed by the Federal Court on the jurisdictional issue but was unsuccessful. The Federal Government brought a motion to have the case dismissed to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal in December 2010 and the matter was heard by Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Chairperson, Shirish Chotalia, in June 2010. Chair Chotalia released her ruling in March 2011 dismissing the child welfare case suggesting that the CHRA required a mirror comparator group and child welfare services funded by the Federal Government for First Nations could not be compared to services provided to all others by the provinces and territories.|$|R

5000|$|The FSIA is in {{practice}} primarily a jurisdictional statute. For the most part, it indicates what conditions {{must be met}} {{in order for a}} lawsuit against a foreign state to be instituted, not what conduct by a foreign sovereign is actionable. If a foreign defendant qualifies as a [...] "Foreign State" [...] under the FSIA, the Act provides that it shall be immune to suit in any U.S. court—federal or state—unless a statutory exception to immunity applies. The applicability of an exception to immunity is a matter of subject-matter jurisdiction, meaning if there is no exception to immunity, a court cannot hear the claim and must dismiss the suit. In Verlinden B.V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, defendant <b>challenged</b> <b>the</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of <b>the</b> district court, saying that FSIA could not give <b>jurisdiction</b> to <b>the</b> district court since it was not a case [...] "arising under" [...] federal law. The Supreme Court then found that since any invocation of <b>jurisdiction</b> under <b>the</b> FSIA would necessarily involve analysis of the exceptions to FSIA, FSIA cases by definition arise under federal law.|$|R
2500|$|On 26 November 2009, Karadžić filed a <b>motion</b> <b>challenging</b> <b>the</b> legal {{validity}} and {{legitimacy of the}} tribunal, claiming that [...] "the UN Security Council lacked the power to establish the ICTY, violated agreements under international law in so doing, and delegated non-existent legislative powers to the ICTY", to which the Prosecution response was that [...] "The Appeals Chamber has already determined {{the validity of the}} Tribunal’s creation in previous decisions which constitute established precedent on this issue", therefore dismissing the Motion.

40|$|This article {{considers}} Robert Peel’s role in {{the repeal}} of the Test and Corporation Acts in 1828. Traditionally overshadowed by the larger campaign to secure catholic emancipation in 1829, the repeal legislation assumes importance in Peel’s political career for three reasons. It was Peel’s first major challenge as leader of the house of commons in Wellington’s ministry; his handling of the issue revealed all his strengths and weaknesses in the role. Peel’s insistence on the active participation of the anglican Church hierarchy in passing repeal with appropriate safeguards (through a declaration to be taken by the majority of officeholders) foreshadowed his later tactics in settling contentious Church issues by negotiation with the Church’s leaders (leading to the formation of the Ecclesiastical Commission in 1835). The success of Russell’s original repeal <b>motion</b> <b>challenged</b> <b>the</b> expectation (shared by Peel) that repeal would follow, rather than precede, emancipation. The necessity of confronting repeal head-on formed a backdrop to that ‘ripening’ of Peel’s views which commentators and historians have detected during this period...|$|R

40|$|International {{investment}} cases {{show the}} {{frequent use of}} good faith arguments by both investors and respondent states. These cases also illustrate how parties and tribunals tend to conceptualize the good faith principle which has become an important rule of international investment law. This article will explore recent trends {{in order to assess}} the importance of this argument for both parties and at different stages of the proceeding. This article will also provide an overview of responses given by the tribunals faced with good faith arguments. Whereas claimants have traditionally relied on this concept to argue the breach of fair and equitable treatment and legitimate expectations, recent cases such as Inceysa, Phoenix and TSA Spectrum, indicate a new defense strategy for respondent states. Given the fact that investment tribunals have shown willingness to treat the good faith principle as autonomous and as a self-standing standard, the possibilities for respondent states have increased. Respondent states can rely on good faith to deny the right of claimants to seize the tribunal (Article 41 (5) of the ICSID Rules), to <b>challenge</b> <b>the</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of <b>the</b> tribunal or admissibility, to contest the right of the claimant to have a decision in its favor, or to <b>challenge</b> <b>the</b> right to compensation...|$|R
5|$|In Lee Hsien Loong the appellants, {{which were}} in Hong Kong, <b>challenged</b> <b>the</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> of <b>the</b> High Court to hear a {{defamation}} suit brought by the respondents on the ground, among others, that {{the service of the}} writ should have been effected in accordance with the civil procedure convention set down in the Treaty of Judicial Assistance in Civil and Commercial Matters between the Republic of Singapore and the People's Republic of China. Thus, although this was not a judicial review case, the Court had to consider the justiciability of determining whether the treaty applied to Hong Kong, and whether the Court could depart from the views of the executive branch on the matter which were stated in a letter issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Court held that the present case did not involve the exercise of the sovereign or legislative prerogative in matters of high policy. Rather, it was concerned with the effect, and not the making, of the treaty or whether it was advisable. Thus, the letter from the Ministry was not an exercise of executive prerogative power, but merely a statement of opinion.|$|R

50|$|After {{his release}} on November 20, as scheduled, Pollard {{relocated}} {{to an apartment}} secured for him by his attorneys in New York City. A job offer, as a research analyst at a Manhattan investment firm, was retracted due to the restrictions imposed on his Internet access and the inspections to which his employer's computers would be subjected. His attorneys immediately filed a <b>motion</b> <b>challenging</b> <b>the</b> terms of his parole, arguing that the Internet restrictions rendered him unemployable as an analyst, and the GPS-equipped ankle bracelet was unnecessary, as {{he was not a}} flight risk. The filing included affidavits from McFarlane and former Senate Intelligence Committee member Dennis DeConcini declaring that any secrets learned by Pollard thirty years ago were no longer secret, and had no value today. On August 12, 2016, a federal judge denied the motion {{on the basis of a}} statement from James Clapper, the director of U.S. National Intelligence, asserting that contrary to the MacFarlane and DeConcini affidavits, much of the information stolen by Pollard in the 1980s remained secret. The judge also cited Pollard's Israeli citizenship, obtained during his incarceration, as evidence that he was indeed a flight risk.|$|R
