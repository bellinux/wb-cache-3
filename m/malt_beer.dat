Recently, some small boutique breweries began brewing new brands of beer, such as Dancing Camel, Negev, and Can'an.|$|E

50|$|After soft drinks, <b>malt</b> <b>beer</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{beverages}} sold in Iceland. The two main brands are Egils Maltextrakt (1.2% ABV) and Víking Maltöl (0.9% ABV). Additionally, a seasonal hvítöl is available in the Christmas month (2.2% ABV). The Icelandic <b>malt</b> <b>beer</b> was modelled on the Danish maltøl, which is still brewed by at least one company in Denmark.|$|E
25|$|The {{hydrometer}} transformed how beer was brewed. Before {{its introduction}} beers were brewed {{from a single}} malt: brown <b>beers</b> from brown <b>malt,</b> amber <b>beers</b> from amber <b>malt,</b> pale <b>beers</b> from pale <b>malt.</b> Using the hydrometer, brewers could calculate the yield from different malts. They observed that pale malt, though more expensive, yielded far more fermentable material than cheaper malts. For example, brown malt (used for Porter) gave 54 pounds of extract per quarter, whilst pale malt gave 80 pounds. Once this was known, brewers switched to using mostly pale <b>malt</b> for all <b>beers</b> supplemented with a small quantity of highly coloured malt to achieve the correct colour for darker beers.|$|R
50|$|Various foreign beer brands are {{available}} on the Korean market, with interest rapidly increasing. Major brands such as Hoegaarden, Heineken, and Budweiser rank high in the Korean beer market. Due to the cost of <b>malt,</b> Korean <b>beer</b> makers have largely turned to using corn, rice, and tapioca for manufacturing. Korean <b>beer's</b> <b>malt</b> rate is about 7%. Comparatively, German <b>beer's</b> <b>malt</b> rate is 100% with Japanese beer being 66%. With the signing of the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between Europe and Korea in 2014, the import of foreign beers has drastically increased.|$|R

As World War II reached its conclusion in the 1940s, matches, petroleum, and standard weights and measures also came under the Monopoly Bureau's authority.|$|R

40|$|Malting and brewing {{processes}} remove much of {{the proteins}} in the traditional grist to generate amino acids for yeast metabolism and to minimize the risks of colloidal instability of the beer. The question is whether gluten and the relevant celiac-inducing peptide sequences of hordein can be sufficiently eliminated to obtain gluten-free beers. The test kits used for the gluten and celiac-toxic peptide analysis are: Sandwich ELISA-RIDASCREEN Gliadin for gluten analysis R 7001 and Competitive ELISA-RIDASCREEN Gliadin for celiac-toxic peptide analysis R 7011 and/or R 7021. The standards for the gluten estimation are Prolamin Working Group (PWG) reference material. The gluten content of the examined <b>malt</b> <b>beers</b> is beneath the quantitative detection limit (5 ppm) to 101 ppm as determined with the Sandwich ELISA-Ridascreen Gliadin kit for gluten proteins. 45 of the 58 examined beers are then gluten-free (< 20 ppm gluten). This corresponds with 26 different breweries producing these beers. When using the Competitive ELISA-Ridascreen Gliadin kits {{only a small part}} of these ‘gluten-free’ beers will still be gluten-free as the Competitive ELISA kit analyzes for the toxic gluten peptides. Preliminary lab scale brewing experiments (60 Liter pilot brewery) and two industrial brewing case studies revealed that the gluten content in the final beer can clearly be diminished by either using prolyl endopeptidase and/or tannins during the brewing processes. Even 100 % barley <b>malt</b> <b>beers</b> can obtain a final gluten and toxic gluten peptides content lower than the threshold for food products to be declared ‘gluten-free’...|$|R
