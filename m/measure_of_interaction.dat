40|$|Alterations <b>of</b> <b>interaction</b> (connectivity) <b>of</b> the EEG reflect {{pathological}} {{processes in}} patients with neurologic disorders. Nevertheless, it is questionable whether these patterns are reliable over time in different <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>interaction</b> and whether this reliability <b>of</b> the <b>measures</b> is the same across different patient populations. In order to address this topic we examined 22 patients with mild cognitive impairment, five patients with subjective cognitive complaints, six patients with right-lateralized temporal lobe epilepsy, seven patients with left lateralized temporal lobe epilepsy, and 20 healthy controls. We calculated 14 <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>interaction</b> from two EEG-recordings separated by 2 weeks. In order to characterize test-retest reliability, we correlated these measures for each group and compared the correlations between measures and between groups. We found that both <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>interaction</b> as well as groups differed {{from each other in}} terms of reliability. The strongest correlation coefficients were found for spectrum, coherence, and full frequency directed transfer function (average rho > 0. 9). In the delta (2 – 4 Hz) range, reliability was lower for mild cognitive impairment compared to healthy controls and left lateralized temporal lobe epilepsy. In the beta (13 – 30 Hz), gamma (31 – 80 Hz), and high gamma (81 – 125 Hz) frequency ranges we found decreased reliability in subjective cognitive complaints compared to mild cognitive impairment. In the gamma and high gamma range we found increased reliability in left lateralized temporal lobe epilepsy patients compared to healthy controls. Our results emphasize the importance of documenting reliability <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>interaction,</b> which may vary considerably between measures, but also between patient populations. We suggest that studies claiming clinical usefulness <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>interaction</b> should provide information on the reliability of the results. In addition, differences between patient groups in reliability <b>of</b> <b>interactions</b> in the EEG indicate the potential of reliability to serve as a new biomarker for pathological memory decline as well as for epilepsy.

40|$|<b>Measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>interaction</b> (connectivity) <b>of</b> the EEG {{are at the}} {{forefront}} of current neuroscientific research. Unfortunately, test-retest reliability can be very low, depending on the measure and its estimation, the EEG-frequency of interest, the length of the signal, and the population under investigation. In addition, artifacts can hamper the continuity of the EEG signal, and in some clinical situations it is impractical to exclude artifacts. We aimed to examine factors that moderate test-retest reliability <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>interaction.</b> The study involved 40 patients with a range of neurological diseases and memory impairments (age median: 60; range 21 – 76; 40 % female; 22 mild cognitive impairment, 5 subjective cognitive complaints, 13 temporal lobe epilepsy), and 20 healthy controls (age median: 61. 5; range 23 – 74; 70 % female). We calculated 14 <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>interaction</b> based on the multivariate autoregressive model from two EEG-recordings separated by 2 weeks. We characterized test-retest reliability by correlating the measures between the two EEG-recordings for variations of data length, data discontinuity, artifact exclusion, model order, and frequency over all combinations of channels and all frequencies, individually for each subject, yielding a correlation coefficient for each participant. Excluding artifacts had strong effects on reliability <b>of</b> some <b>measures,</b> such as classical, real valued coherence (~ 0. 1 before, ~ 0. 9 after artifact exclusion). Full frequency directed transfer function was highly reliable and robust against artifacts. Variation of data length decreased reliability in relation to poor adjustment of model order and signal length. Variation of discontinuity had no effect, but reliabilities were different between model orders, frequency ranges, and patient groups depending on the measure. Pathology did not interact with variation of signal length or discontinuity. Our results emphasize the importance of documenting reliability, which may vary considerably between <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>interaction.</b> We recommend careful selection <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>interaction</b> in accordance with the properties of the data. When only short data segments are available and when the signal length varies strongly across subjects after exclusion of artifacts, reliability becomes an issue. Finally, measures which show high reliability irrespective of the presence of artifacts could be extremely useful in clinical situations when exclusion of artifacts is impractical...|$|R

We hypothesize that the combination <b>of</b> SPECT with <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>interaction</b> (connectivity) in the EEG yields higher diagnostic accuracy than the single modalities. We examined 39 patients with Alzheimer's dementia (AD), 69 patients with depressive cognitive impairment (DCI), 71 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 41 patients with amnestic subjective cognitive complaints (aSCC). We calculated 14 <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>interaction</b> from a standard clinical EEG-recording and derived graph-theoretic network measures. From regional brain perfusion measured by 99 mTc-hexamethyl-propylene-aminoxime (HMPAO) -SPECT in 46 regions, we calculated relative cerebral perfusion in these patients. Patient groups were classified pairwise with a linear support vector machine. Classification was conducted separately for each biomarker, and then again for each EEG- biomarker combined with SPECT. Combination of SPECT with EEG-biomarkers outperformed single use of SPECT or EEG when classifying aSCC vs. AD (90 %), aMCI vs. AD (70 %), and AD vs. DCI (100 %), while a selection <b>of</b> EEG <b>measures</b> performed best when classifying aSCC vs. aMCI (82 %) and aMCI vs. DCI (90 %). Only the contrast between aSCC and DCI {{did not result in}} above-chance classification accuracy (60 %). In general, accuracies were higher when <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>interaction</b> (i. e., connectivity measures) were applied directly than when graph-theoretical measures were derived.

40|$|By a plant's {{inherent}} control limitations we {{mean the}} characteristics of the plant which will cause poor control performance irrespective of what controller is used. Another frequently used term is 'dynamic resilience' which is the best closed-loop performance achievable using any controller. Since a plant's dynamic resilience cannot be altered by change of the control algorithm, but only by design modifications, it follows that the term controllability provides a link between process design and process control. In this paper we focus on two aspects of controllability. The plants' sensitivity to disturbances and the limitations imposed by interactions when using decentralized control. We use simple tools such as the RGA, the PRGA (Performance RGA) and the closely related Closed Loop Disturbance Gain (CLDG). For example, if kth column of the CLDG is large, then this indicates that disturbance k will be difficult to reject. This may pinpoint the need for modifying the process.

This enables direct interpretation of "uncorrected" estimates of J, something not possible with "uncorrected" estimates of either F, G or K.
