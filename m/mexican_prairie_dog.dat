50|$|The <b>Mexican</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> (Cynomys mexicanus) is a diurnal {{burrowing}} rodent {{native to}} Mexico. Treatment as an agricultural pest {{has led to}} its status as an endangered species. They {{are closely related to}} squirrels, chipmunks, and marmots.|$|E
50|$|In 1956, the <b>Mexican</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> was {{reported}} as occurring in Coahuila, Nuevo León, and San Luis Potosí. By the 1980s, it had disappeared from Nuevo León, and its complete range {{was less than}} 800 km2 (310 mi2). Viewed as a pest and an obstacle to agriculture and cattle raising, it was frequently poisoned, and became endangered in 1994. Mexican prairie dogs currently inhabit less than 4% of their former territory.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mexican</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> live in {{excavated}} colonies, {{referred to}} as [...] "towns", which they dig for shelter and protection. A typical town has a funnel-like entrance that slants down into a corridor up to 100 ft long, with side chambers for storage and nesting.|$|R
50|$|The Gunnison’s <b>prairie</b> <b>dog,</b> C. gunnisoni, is {{the only}} <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> species that has 40 chromosomes. The other four species, black-tailed, white-tailed, Utah, and <b>Mexican</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs,</b> have 50 chromosomes.Their coats are yellow-toned buff merged with black-colored hairs. The upper head, sides of the cheek, and eyebrows are {{distinctly}} darker {{than the rest of}} the body. Their tails are mostly white with grayish-white ends and the tips are light gray.|$|R
50|$|With {{exception}} of two species, the black-tailed and <b>Mexican,</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dogs</b> hibernate. During the winter, the Gunnison's <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> stays underground {{for long periods}} of time without food or water, using physiological adaptations to control their metabolism. Their bodies also rely on their stored body fat during hibernation. After hibernation, they become active again around March or April. This species is most active during the months of April through October.|$|R

40|$|Of all of {{the native}} species found on National Park Service (NPS) lands, perhaps none have been as {{maligned}} by park managers as the various species of prairie dog (Cynomys spp.). Conversely, no native species has tormented as many park managers as the prairie dog. Arguably, throughout the agency’s long history {{the management of the}} prairie dog, and especially that of the black-tailed prairie dog (C. ludovicianus), has been one of its most difficult, discordant, and acrimonious wildlife issues. Even today, the perception of prairie dogs, both within and outside the agency, ranges from a charismatic keystone species worthy of conservation to a pest worthy of extermination. In this paper we document the history, current status, and management of black-tailed (C. ludovicianus), Gunnison’s (C. gunnisoni), whitetailed (C. leucurus), and Utah (C. parvidens) prairie dogs within the national park system (a fifth species, the <b>Mexican</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dog,</b> C. mexicanus, is not found in NPS units). Most wildlife issues that challenge park managers can be found embedded in prairie dog management. History of prairie dog management in the National Park Service Despite laws and policies to conserve native wildlife, the NPS has often struggled to achieve such goals (Sellars 1997).

40|$|Prairie {{dogs are}} stocky {{burrowing}} rodents {{that live in}} colonies called “towns. ” French explorers called them “little dogs” because of the barking noise they make. Their legs are short and muscular, adapted for digging. The tail and other extremities are short. Their hair is rather coarse with little underfur, and is sandy brown to cinnamon in color with grizzled black and buff-colored tips. The belly is light cream to white. Five species of prairie dogs are found in North America: the black-tailed (Cynomys ludovicianus), Mexican (C. mexicanus), white-tailed (C. leucurus), Gunnison’s (C. gunnisoni), and Utah prairie dog (C. parvidens). The most abundant and widely distributed {{of these is the}} black-tailed prairie dog, which is named for its black-tipped tail. Adult black-tailed prairie dogs weigh 2 to 3 pounds (0. 9 to 1. 4 kg) and are 14 to 17 inches (36 to 43 cm) long. The <b>Mexican</b> <b>prairie</b> <b>dog</b> also has a black-tipped tail, but is smaller than its northern relative. White-tailed, Gunnison’s, and Utah prairie dogs all have white-tipped tails. White-tailed prairie dogs are usually smaller than blacktailed prairie dogs, weighing between 1 1 / 2 and 2 1 / 2 pounds (0. 7 to 1. 1 kg). The Gunnison’s prairie dog is the smallest of the five species. Exclusion: Wire mesh fences can be installed but they are usually not practical or cost-effective. Visual barriers of suspended burlap, windrowed pine trees, or snow fence may be effective. Cultural Methods: Modify grazing practices on mixed and mid-grass rangelands to exclude or inhibit prairie dogs. Cultivate, irrigate, and establish tall crops to discourage prairie dog use. Frightening: No methods are effective. Repellents: None are registered. Toxicants: Zinc phosphide. Fumigants: Aluminum phosphide. Gas cartridges. Trapping: Box traps. Snares. Conibear® No. 110 (body-gripping) traps or equivalent. Shooting: Shooting with. 22 rimfire or larger rifles. Other Methods: Several home remedies have been used but most are unsafe and are not cost-effective...|$|E
