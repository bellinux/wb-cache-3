40|$|The Berlengas were {{visited by}} R. M. Lockley, who {{stayed on the}} main island from 20 to 24 June 1939. At that time, only four seabird species were found {{breeding}} at Berlenga (Lockley 1952), namely Cory's Shearwater Calonectris diomedea, Shag Phalacrocorax aristotelis (c. 70 pairs), Herring Gull Larus argentatus (c. 1000 pairs) and Guillemot Uria aalgae (c. 6000 pairs). Breeding of all four species had been known to earlier ornithologists though population sizes had not been estimated prior to Lockley's visit. Unfortunately, {{it is not clear}} which census techniques Lockley used to make his evaluation of the breeding populations (Lockley 1952), and care must be taken when using his result to check any subsequent population changes. The Berlenga islands are located off the western coast of Portugal, near the fishing village of Peniche. During the breeding seasons of 1977, 1978 and 1981, census work was carried out at the Berlengas, following current techniques described elsewhere (Cramp et al. 1974, Lloyd 1975, Nettleship 1976). A futher three species were found to breed, namely <b>Madeiran</b> <b>Petrel</b> Oceanodroma castro, Lesser Black-backed Gull L. fuscusand Kittiwake Rissa tridactyla...|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{introduced}} predators on the native fauna of oceanic islands {{has proven to}} be catastrophic in many cases. In some instances, however, predation is caused by very few individuals arrived without any human assistance. Here, I report on the impact of a vagrant Short-eared Owl on the small population (200 breeding pairs) of cool-season <b>Madeiran</b> Storm <b>Petrels</b> from Praia Islet (0. 12 km 2), off Graciosa Island, Azores archipelago. The owl fed almost exclusively on storm petrels and killed between one and two individuals every night. The number of prey remains found suggests that it must have been present on the islet ca two weeks before its presence was noticed. Although the Short-eared Owl is a rare vagrant in the Azores, these observations show that a single individual may have a strong impact on a vulnerable population of <b>Madeiran</b> Storm <b>Petrels...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{island has}} been {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International as a breeding site for seabirds. Birds for which the IBA is significant include <b>Madeiran</b> storm <b>petrels</b> (1500 breeding pairs), red-billed tropicbirds (500 pairs), white-tailed tropicbirds (1000 pairs), Ascension frigatebirds (6000 pairs), masked boobies (1300 pairs) and black noddies (5000 pairs).|$|R

40|$|Procellariiform seabirds are {{amongst the}} most {{severely}} threatened taxa worldwide. Whilst the specific threats vary among species, {{problems such as}} introduced predators, loss of suitable nesting habitat and inter- and intra-specific competition for nest sites are common to many situations. This paper reports on an experiment to increase the availability of secure nest sites at a colony of <b>Madeiran</b> storm <b>petrels</b> breeding on an islet (free from introduced predators) in the Azores islands where {{there is evidence of}} inter-specific competition. The provision of nest boxes that were designed to exclude larger species led to around a 12 % increase {{in the size of the}} breeding population in the first year and a 28 % increase over the original colony size in the second year. Over three seasons, the breeding success of storm petrels nesting in boxes averaged 2. 9 times greater than that of birds at natural sites, despite their likely reproductive inexperience. The techniques presented here should serve as a model for conservation management of other burrowing procellariiform species in situations where colony size or breeding performance is believed to be constrained by nest site quality...|$|R
40|$|<b>Madeiran</b> storm <b>petrels</b> Oceanodroma castro breed {{on three}} small islets in the Azores: Vila, off Santa Maria, and Praia and Baixo, off Graciosa. Analysis {{of data on}} brood patch, {{incubation}} periods, chick body size and recaptures of adults provides evidence {{of the existence of}} two distinct populations (hot- and cool-season) breeding annually on Baixo and Praia, out of phase by four to five months and overlapping in colony attendance during August and early September; on Vila only the cool-season population is present. Analyses of adult morphology indicate highly significant phenotypic differentiation between the sympatric hot- and cool-season breeders, whereas an almost complete phenotypic uniformity characterizes allopatric breeders within the same season. The hot-season birds are 10 % smaller in egg and body mass but have longer wings and tails than cool-season birds. The two groups were readily separated by discriminant analysis. The preference to breed in the cooler season is interpreted as a consequence of greater food availability in that period. Morphological differentiation between seasonal populations is interpreted as an adaptative response to different environmental conditions in the two seasons. The hypothesis is given that the hot-season population has evolved from the cool-season population owing to density-dependent constraints on crowded colonies, forcing birds to time-share nest sites. These populations may represent a case of sympatric speciation through temporal partitioning of reproduction and may be better treated as sibling species...|$|R
