40|$|The <b>method</b> <b>of</b> {{constrained}} <b>randomisation</b> {{is applied}} to three-dimensional simulated galaxy distributions. With this technique we generate for a given data set surrogate data sets which have the same linear properties as the original data whereas higher order or nonlinear correlations are not preserved.

We demonstrate how to generate surrogate data sets from a given point distribution, which have the same linear properties (power spectrum) as well as the same density amplitude distribution. We propose weighted scaling indices as a nonlinear statistical measure to quantify local morphological elements in large scale structure. Using surrogates is is shown that the data sets with the same 2 -point correlation functions have slightly different void probability functions and especially a different set of weighted scaling indices. Thus a refined analysis of the large scale structure becomes possible by calculating local scaling properties whereby the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> constrained <b>randomisation</b> yields a vital tool for testing the performance of statistical measures in terms of sensitivity to different topological features and discriminative power.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{healthcare}} {{research the}} {{randomised controlled trial}} {{is seen as the}} gold standard because it ensures selection bias is minimised. However, there is uncertainty as to which is the most preferred <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>randomisation</b> in any given setting and to what extent more complex methods are actually being implemented in the field. Methods In this paper we describe the results of a survey of UK academics and publicly funded researchers to examine the extent of the use of various methods of randomisation in clinical trials. Results Trialists reported using simple randomisation, permuted blocks and stratification more often than more complex methods such as minimisation. Most trialists believed that simple randomisation is suitable for larger trials but there is a high probability of possible imbalance between treatment groups in small trials. It was thought that groups should be balanced at baseline to avoid imbalance and help face-validity. However, very few respondents considered that more complex methods offer any advantages. Conclusions This paper demonstrates that for most UK trialists the preferred <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>randomisation</b> is using permuted blocks of varying random length within strata. This method eliminates the problem of predictability while maintaining balance across combinations of factors. If the number of prognostic factors is large, then minimisation can be used to provide treatment balance as well as balance over these factors. However, only those factors known to affect outcome should be considered. </p...|$|E
40|$|Several {{literacy}} reports {{published in}} the last decade have emphasised the large gap in the reading attainment of children in New Zealand. A common barrier that prevents poor readers to catch up to their peers is difficulty in reading fluency, which is theorised to represent underlying difficulty in rapid and automatic word recognition. The ability to rapidly recognise a few common words, also known as high frequency words (HFWs), may increase the fluency of reading the majority of novel text. As such, the National Standards for literacy achievement outline the development of basic HFW vocabulary {{by the end of the}} first few years at school. However, past research that has investigated single word training has rarely used HFWs and those that have used HFWs have scarcely investigated its transfer to in-text reading. Therefore, the aims of the current research were to provide an investigation of HFW training and its influence on word reading accuracy, intext word reading, and passage reading accuracy, speed, and comprehension. Experiment 1 was a single case design carried out with one 8 year old participant and was largely used to inform the second experiment. Experiment 2 was a multiple baseline design carried out with five 8 - 9 year old participants using a modified training procedure. Experiment 1 utilised visual analysis and Cohen’s d effect size analysis whereas Experiment 2 also used statistical analysis, made possible through the Wampold-Worsham <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>randomisation</b> incorporated into the experimental design. The results of both experiments indicated that training facilitated word reading accuracy but the successful transfer of target words to in-text reading was only observed in Experiment 2. Post-training increases to passage reading accuracy, speed, and comprehension scores were not apparent in either experiment. The main contribution of the current research is its applicability to classroom practice. Another important contribution of the study to research practice is the rare application of the Wampold-Worsham <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>randomisation...</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: Severe {{pre-eclampsia}} {{can cause}} significant mortality and morbidity for {{both mother and}} child, particularly when it occurs remote from term, between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation. The only known cure for this disease is delivery. Some obstetricians advocate early delivery {{to ensure that the}} development of serious maternal complications, such as eclampsia (fits) and kidney failure are prevented. Others prefer a more expectant approach delaying delivery in an attempt to reduce the mortality and morbidity for the child associated with being born too early. Objectives: The objective of the review was to compare the effects of a policy of interventionist care and early delivery with a policy of expectant care and delayed delivery for women with early onset severe pre-eclampsia. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (28 February 2013). Selection criteria: Randomised trials comparing the two intervention strategies for women with early onset severe pre-eclampsia. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Data were checked for accuracy. Main results: Four trials, with a total of 425 women are included in this review.

40|$|Abstract Background Stepped wedge {{randomised}} trial designs involve sequential roll-out of {{an intervention}} to participants (individuals or clusters) {{over a number}} of time periods. By the end of the study, all participants will have received the intervention, although the order in which participants receive the intervention is determined at random. The design is particularly relevant where it is predicted that the intervention will do more good than harm (making a parallel design, in which certain participants do not receive the intervention unethical) and/or where, for logistical, practical or financial reasons, it is impossible to deliver the intervention simultaneously to all participants. Stepped wedge designs offer a number of opportunities for data analysis, particularly for modelling the effect of time on the effectiveness of an intervention. This paper presents a review of 12 studies (or protocols) that use (or plan to use) a stepped wedge design. One aim of the review is to highlight the potential for the stepped wedge design, given its infrequent use to date. Methods Comprehensive literature review of studies or protocols using a stepped wedge design. Data were extracted from the studies in three categories for subsequent consideration: study information (epidemiology, intervention, number of participants), reasons for using a stepped wedge design and <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> data analysis. Results The 12 studies included in this review describe evaluations {{of a wide range of}} interventions, across different diseases in different settings. However the stepped wedge design appears to have found a niche for evaluating interventions in developing countries, specifically those concerned with HIV.

Randomised controlled clinical trials (RCT) or controlled clinical trials (CCT) conducted in adults with good general health were selected. Outcome measuresEvaluation parameters included changes in dental plaque, gingival bleeding/ inflammation and probing pocket depth. Study quality was assessed based upon study design, evaluation period, profiles of subjects, <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>randomisation,</b> blindness of examiners and completeness of followup assessment.

As the selected studies showed considerable heterogeneity in the study designs, characteristics, outcome variables and results, a descriptive review of the data was presented instead of performing a meta-analysis. ResultsSeven papers (four RCT and three CCT) were included. Mean values and standard deviations were collected from the data. Data showed that oral irrigation does not reduce plaque scores more than toothbrushing or regular oral hygiene measures.

30|$|When within-network {{experimental}} {{variation is}} used to identify social effects, careful attention must {{be paid to the}} important issue of inference. At one extreme, a researcher might have many (often thousands) of nodes embedded in the same network, and construct a valid comparison group using similar nodes embedded in {{a different part of the}} network to the treated node. The complication in computing standard errors comes from the fact that all nodes are embedded within the same network, and may face correlated unobserved shocks. Though these shocks may not affect identification, they will generate correlations in the outcomes of units, and must be accounted for when conducting inference. The availability of only a single network makes it very difficult to derive large sample approximations of distributions and thereby to calculate valid standard errors. Athey et al. (2015) extend the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>randomisation</b> inference, which calculates exact p values, to this setting. Under randomisation inference, the distribution of the test statistic is generated by considering all possible realisations of the treatment assignment, keeping the potential outcomes and characteristics of units fixed. A drawback of this procedure is that it allows for testing of sharp null hypotheses—e.g. the treatment has no effect whatsoever—only. However, we often want to test non-sharp hypotheses. Athey et al. (2015) develop methods for the computation of p values for three specific null hypotheses.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Web-based {{interventions}} for physical activity offer several advantages over face-to-face, print-and telephone-based interventions and are scalable and potentially cost-effective. Recent reviews of web-based interventions in adults {{show that they}} have positive but small effects on physical activity but identify a number of limitations including a reliance on self-report measures of outcome. This trial used an objective measure of physical activity to assess the effectiveness of three minimal contact interventions: 1) A multi-component web-based intervention incorporating objective monitoring and graphical feedback of physical activity; 2) A version of the first intervention that consisted only of objective monitoring plus web-based graphical feedback; and 3) Self-monitoring of physical activity using a paper diary. Methods/design Get Moving is an individually randomised controlled trial with allocation of 488 participants {{to one of three}} interventions or to a no-intervention control group. Participants are physically inactive working adults aged 18 – 65 years. They attended a baseline assessment session at which anthropometric, biological and questionnaire measures were taken and they completed a treadmill exercise test. They then wore a combined movement and heart rate monitor for six days and nights before being randomised to one of the four trial arms. The baseline measures were repeated at the follow-up assessment which took place approximately 12  weeks post-randomisation, conducted by staff blind to group allocation. Participants wore the movement and heart rate monitor for six days and nights before this. The co-primary outcomes are: physical activity energy expenditure measured using individually calibrated combined heart-rate and movement data; and cardiorespiratory fitness measured using a sub-maximal treadmill exercise test. Discussion Strengths of the trial include the use of an objective measure of physical activity, a measure of cardiorespiratory fitness, relatively large sample size and the use <b>of</b> robust <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>randomisation,</b> allocation concealment and blinding to outcome assessment.

The analysis of the original and surrogate data sets with measures, which are sensitive to nonlinearities, yields valuable information about the existence of nonlinear correlations in the data. On the other hand one can test whether given statistical measures are able to account for higher order or nonlinear correlations by applying them to original and surrogate data sets.

40|$|Background: Critical commentaries {{suggest that}} wound care {{randomised}} controlled trials (RCTs) are often poorly reported with many methodological flaws. Furthermore, interventions in chronic wounds, {{rather than being}} drugs, are often medical devices for {{which there are no}} requirements for RCTs to bring products to market. RCTs in wounds trials therefore potentially represent a form of marketing. This study presents a methodological overview of chronic wound trials published between 2004 and 2011 and investigates the influence of industry funding on methodological quality. Methods: A systematic search for RCTs for the treatment of chronic wounds published in the English language between 2004 and 2011 (inclusive) in the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register of Trials was carried out. Data were extracted on aspects of trial design, conduct and quality including sample size, duration of follow-up, specification of a primary outcome, use of surrogate outcomes, and risks of bias. In addition, the prevalence of industry funding was assessed and its influence on the above aspects of trial design, conduct and quality was assessed. Results: A total of 167 RCTs met our inclusion criteria. We found chronic wound trials often have short durations of follow-up (median 12 weeks), small sample sizes (median 63), fail to define a primary outcome in 41 % of cases, and those that do define a primary outcome, use surrogate measures of healing in 40 % of cases. Only 40 % of trials used appropriate <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>randomisation,</b> 25 % concealed allocation and 34 % blinded outcome assessors. Of the included trials, 41 % were wholly or partially funded by industry, 33 % declared non-commercial funding and 26 % did not report a funding source. Industry funding was not statistically significantly associated with any measure of methodological quality, though this analysis was probably underpowered. Conclusions: This overview confirms concerns raised about the methodological quality of RCTs in wound care and illustrates that greater efforts must be made to follow international standards for conducting and reporting RCTs. There is currently minimal evidence of an influence of industry funding on methodological quality although analyses had limited power and funding source was not reported for a quarter of studies...|$|R

The aim of this review was to evaluate the risk of bias in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) over a 10 -year period. We searched databases of publications for RCTs published between January 2000 and January 2010. Papers were assessed with 2 up-to-date logical quality lists, the Delphi list and the Jadad scale. Those papers with a low risk of bias were given a Jadad score ≥ 4 (range 0 - 5) and a Delphi score ≥ 6 (range 0 - 9). A total of 230 papers met the inclusion criteria, and only 41 (18 %) were assessed as being at low risk.

The aim {{of this study is to}} systematically review the research evidence on the effectiveness of yoga for this indication Methods: Searches of the major biomedical databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClNAHL, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library were conducted. Specialist complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and the IndMED databases were also searched and efforts made to identify unpublished and ongoing research. Searches were conducted between January and June 2004. Relevant research was categorised by study type and appraised. Clinical commentaries were obtained for studies reporting clinical outcomes. Results: Five randomised controlled trials were located, each of which utilised different forms of yoga interventions and in which the severity of the condition ranged from mild to severe. All trials reported positive findings but methodological details such as <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>randomisation,</b> compliance and attrition rates were missing. No adverse effects were reported with the exception of fatigue and breathlessness in participants in one study. Limitations: No language restrictions were imposed on the searches conducted but no searches of databases in languages other than English were included. Conclusions: Overall, the initial indications are of potentially beneficial effects of yoga interventions on depressive disorders. Variation in interventions, severity and reporting of trial methodology suggests that the findings must be interpreted with caution. Several of the interventions may not be feasible in those with reduced or impaired mobility. Nevertheless, further investigation of yoga as a therapeutic intervention is warranted...|$|E

We describe {{the results of the}} available studies, assess the validity of these results, and give recommendations for optimal study design for AED monotherapy studies in children with epilepsy. Studies were identified using PubMed (Medline), Embase and the Cochrane Library (January 1990 -January 2010). All reports were assessed for methodological quality and results were summarised descriptively. Nine RCTs were included. No difference in efficacy and safety between second-generation AEDs and first-generation AEDs in children was detected. Considerable heterogeneity in study design, inclusion criteria and primary endpoints impaired formal meta-analysis and correct interpretation of results. Follow-up periods were between 2 and 104 weeks; the dosage of the tested AEDs varied between studies, with sometimes use of apparent subtherapeutic dosages; in only two studies the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>randomisation</b> was well described, in only three the power calculations; several studies did not use an intention-to-treat analysis. Although from the available studies first- and second-generation AEDs appear to have similar efficacy and safety in children with epilepsy, these trials are inadequate to provide a sufficient evidence base for decision making. Better trials are needed: AEDs should be studied in optimal paediatric doses, power should be sufficient to detect small but clinically relevant differences, and the follow-up period should be long enough. Most important, primary endpoint to be evaluated should be time to treatment failure or retention rate, since these outcomes combine efficacy and safety. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Background: Despite medical therapies and {{surgical}} interventions for Parkinson's disease (PD), patients develop progressive disability. The role of physiotherapy is to maximise functional ability and minimise secondary complications through movement rehabilitation within {{a context of}} education {{and support for the}} whole person. The overall aim is to optimise independence, safety and wellbeing, thereby enhancing quality of life. Trials have shown that physiotherapy has short-term benefits in PD. However, which physiotherapy intervention is most effective remains unclear. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of one physiotherapy intervention compared with a second approach in patients with PD. Search methods: Relevant trials were identified by electronic searches of numerous literature databases (for example MEDLINE, EMBASE) and trial registers, plus handsearching of major journals, abstract books, conference proceedings and reference lists of retrieved publications. The literature search included trials published up to the end of January 2012. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials of one physiotherapy intervention versus another physiotherapy intervention in patients with PD. Data collection and analysis: Data were abstracted independently from each paper by two authors. Trials were classified into the following intervention comparisons: general physiotherapy, exercise, treadmill training, cueing, dance and martial arts. Main results: A total of 43 trials were identified with 1673 participants. All trials used small patient numbers (average trial size of 39 participants); the <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>randomisation</b> and concealment <b>of</b> allocation were poor or not stated in most trials. Blinded assessors were used in just over half of the trials and only 10 stated that they used intention-to-treat analysis. A wide variety of validated and customised outcome measures were used to assess the effectiveness of physiotherapy interventions. The most frequently reported physiotherapy outcomes were gait speed and timed up and go, in 19 and 15 trials respectively. Only five of the 43 trials reported data on falls (12 %). The motor subscales of the Unified Parkinson?s Disease Rating Scale and Parkinson?s Disease Questionnaire- 39 were the most commonly reported clinician-rated disability and patient-rated quality of life outcome measures, used in 22 and 13 trials respectively. The content and delivery of the physiotherapy interventions varied widely in the trials included within this review, so no quantitative meta-analysis could be performed. Authors' conclusions: Considering the small number of participants examined, the methodological flaws in many of the studies, the possibility of publication bias, and the variety of interventions, formal comparison of the different physiotherapy techniques could not be performed. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of one physiotherapy intervention over another in PD. This review shows that a wide range of physiotherapy interventions to treat PD have been tested. There is a need for more specific trials with improved treatment strategies to underpin the most appropriate choice of physiotherapy intervention and the outcomes measured...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Endometriosis is {{a common}} gynaecological {{condition}} which affects many women of reproductive age worldwide and is {{a major cause of}} pain and infertility. The modern oral contraceptive pill is widely used to treat pain occurring as a result of endometriosis, although the evidence for its efficacy is limited. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) in comparison to other treatments for painful symptoms of endometriosis in women of reproductive age. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register of controlled trials; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2006); MEDLINE (January 1966 to September 2006); EMBASE (1980 to September 2006); National Research Register; and reference lists of articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: All truly randomised controlled trials of the use of oral contraceptive pills in the treatment of women of reproductive age with symptoms ascribed to the diagnosis of endometriosis and made visually at surgical procedure were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Study quality assessment and data extraction were carried out independently by two review authors. One of the assessors was an expert in the content matter. We contacted study authors for additional information. MAIN RESULTS: Only one study met the inclusion criteria, in which a total of 57 women were allocated to two groups to compare an OCP to a GnRH analogue. <b>Methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>randomisation</b> and allocation concealment were unclear and the study was acknowledged by its authors to be underpowered. Women in the GnRH analogue group became amenorrhoeic during the treatment period of six months, whilst women in the OCP group reported a decrease in dysmenorrhoea. No evidence of {{a significant difference between the}} two groups was observed in terms of dysmenorrhoea at six months follow up after stopping treatment (OR 0. 48; 95 % CI 0. 08 to 2. 90). Some evidence for a decrease in dyspareunia was found at the end of treatment in women in the GnRH analogue group, although no evidence of a significant difference in dyspareunia was observed at the end of the six months follow up (OR 4. 87; 95 % CI 0. 96 to 24. 65). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The limited data we found available suggests that this is no evidence of a difference in outcomes between the the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) studied and GnRH analogue was as effective as a GnRH analogue in treating for endometriosis-associated painful symptoms of endometriosis. However, the lack of studies with larger sample sizes, or focusing on other comparable treatments is concerning and further research is needed to fully evaluate fully the role of OCPs oral contraceptive pills in managing symptoms associated with ement of endometriosis...|$|R

The aim of our review {{was to assess}} whether the criteria recommended by the CONSORT extension were followed. Methods We searched the Medline database and the Cochrane Central Register for reports of randomised non-inferiority and equivalence trials published in English language. We excluded reports on bioequivalence studies, reports targeting on other than the main results of a trial, and articles of which the full-text version was not available. In total, we identified 209 reports (167 non-inferiority, 42 equivalence trials) and assessed the reporting and methodological quality using abstracted items of the CONSORT extension. Results Half of the articles did not report on the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>randomisation</b> and {{only a third of}} the trials were reported to use blinding. The non-inferiority or equivalence margin was defined in most reports (94 %), but was justified only for a quarter of the trials. Sample size calculation was reported for a proportion of 90 %, but the margin was taken into account in only 78 % of the trials reported. Both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis were presented in {{less than half of the}} reports. When reporting the results, a confidence interval was given for 85 % trials. A proportion of 21 % of the reports presented a conclusion that was wrong or incomprehensible. Overall, we found a substantial lack of quality in reporting and conduct. The need to improve also applied to aspects generally recommended for randomised trials. The quality was partly better in high-impact journals as compared to others.

If important prognostic factors are identified at the design stage then stratified randomisation or minimisation can help to balance these features. Aim: To examine the relative benefits of different randomisation algorithms and determine guidelines for which randomisation design is advisable for a given trial. For a trial of known size with a specified number of important prognostic factors, and levels within these, {{it will be possible to}} identify the most appropriate randomisation technique for that trial. Methods: A review of methods of randomisation was first conducted followed by a survey of trialists into the current use of randomisation methods in clinical trials. Using simulations the following comparisons were made; simple randomisation compared with minimisation, whether to stratify or minimise by centre and predictability versus balance when using minimisation. The recommendations resulting from the simulations were used to design a prototype generic randomisation program. Results: The review and the survey both highlighted the probability of imbalance using simple randomisation. Minimisation was seen to be superior in producing balanced groups but the method was criticised for being more complex and unpredictable. The simulations showed that several factors influence imbalance including size of trial, the number of prognostic factors and the number of categories within these. Optimal algorithms for maintaining balance while reducing predictability were presented for varying trial parameters. Conclusions: Minimisation is a suitable <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>randomisation</b> for most clinical trials. Several strategies can be employed to address the conflicting issues of predictability and imbalance without resorting to complex mathematical algorithms.

30|$|For {{percutaneous}} screw fixation, {{among all}} studies reviewed, {{there was a}} total cohort of 274 patients, {{with an average age}} of 27.8  years. Union rate was 98.5  %, with an average time to union of 46  days and average time to return to manual work of 40  days. Among RCTs comparing the two treatment modalities, the RCT performed by Adolfsson et al. [7] was a poor-quality study providing level 2 b evidence. They did not report the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>randomisation</b> and lacked power calculation. Furthermore, a paucity of demographic data did not enable a fair comparison between groups; 25  % of patients were lost to follow-up or excluded from analysis, and outcome assessors were not blinded, which may have been a source of bias. However, the RCT reported by Bond et al. [8] was a high-quality study providing level 1 b evidence. There were clear inclusion and exclusion criteria, with adequate study power and 100  % follow-up. A limitation of their study was the potential inaccuracy of detecting union with plain radiographs instead of CT scans and the limited times of radiographs being performed. There could be a possibility of observer bias, as two authors themselves assessed the radiographs for union. The study also had poor generalisability, as all participants were full-time military personnel and therefore the times to return to duty may not reflect the time to return to work in the general population. In comparison, the RCT by McQueen et al. [9] was also a high quality study providing level 1 b evidence. It is the only study in which the outcomes were measured by a blinded assessor, thereby reducing the risk of bias. A power and sample size calculation was, however, not reported. Rehabilitation may have differed between the groups as not all the patients had physiotherapy. Union rates may be inaccurate as radiographs alone were used to define union due to the reasons discussed earlier.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Chronic {{pelvic pain}} (CPP) affects &# 62; 1 million UK women. Annual {{healthcare}} costs are estimated at &# 62;£ 150 million. Proven interventions for CPP are limited, and treatment is often unsatisfactory. Gabapentin is increasingly prescribed due to reports of effectiveness in other chronic pain conditions, {{but there are}} insufficient data supporting value in CPP specifically. The mechanism by which gabapentin exerts its analgesic action is unknown. Given the prevalence and costs of CPP, the authors believe that a large, multicentre, placebo-controlled, double-blind randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of gabapentin in management of CPP is required. The focus {{of this study is}} a pilot to inform planning of a future randomised controlled trial. Methods and analysis: The authors plan to perform a two-arm, parallel, randomised controlled pilot trial. The authors aim to recruit 60 women with CPP in NHS Lothian and NHS Grampian (UK) and randomise them to gabapentin or placebo. Response to treatment will be monitored by questionnaire compared at 0, 3 and 6  months. The primary objective is to assess recruitment and retention rates. The secondary objectives are to determine the effectiveness and acceptability to participants <b>of</b> the proposed <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> recruitment, <b>randomisation,</b> drug treatments and assessment tools and to perform a pretrial cost-effectiveness assessment of treatment with gabapentin. Ethics and dissemination: Ethical approval has been obtained from the Scotland A Research Ethics Committee (LREC 12 /SS/ 0005). Data will be presented at international conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals. </p...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundPeople with {{schizophrenia}} {{from families}} that express {{high levels of}} criticism, hostility, or over involvement, have more frequent relapses than people with similar problems from families that {{tend to be less}} expressive of emotions. Forms of psychosocial intervention, designed to reduce these levels of expressed emotions within families, are now widely used. ObjectivesTo estimate the effects of family psychosocial interventions in community settings for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like conditions compared with standard care. Search strategyWe updated previous searches by searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (September 2008). Selection criteriaWe selected randomised or quasi-randomised studies focusing primarily on families of people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder that compared community-orientated family-based psychosocial intervention with standard care. Data collection and analysisWe independently extracted data and calculated fixed-effect relative risk (RR), the 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for binary data, and, where appropriate, the number needed to treat (NNT) on an intention-to-treat basis. for continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD). Main resultsThis 2009 - 10 update adds 21 additional studies, with a total of 53 randomised controlled trials included. Family intervention may decrease the frequency of relapse (n = 2981, 32 RCTs, RR 0. 55 CI 0. 5 to 0. 6, NNT 7 CI 6 to 8), although some small but negative studies might not have been identified by the search. Family intervention may also reduce hospital admission (n = 481, 8 RCTs, RR 0. 78 CI 0. 6 to 1. 0, NNT 8 CI 6 to 13) and encourage compliance with medication (n = 695, 10 RCTs, RR 0. 60 CI 0. 5 to 0. 7, NNT 6 CI 5 to 9) but it does not obviously affect the tendency of individuals/families to leave care (n = 733, 10 RCTs, RR 0. 74 CI 0. 5 to 1. 0). Family intervention also seems to improve general social impairment and the levels of expressed emotion within the family. We did not find data to suggest that family intervention either prevents or promotes suicide. Authors' conclusionsFamily intervention may reduce the number of relapse events and hospitalisations and would therefore be of interest to people with schizophrenia, clinicians and policy makers. However, the treatment effects of these trials may be overestimated due to the poor methodological quality. Further data from trials that describe the <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>randomisation,</b> test the blindness of the study evaluators, and implement the CONSORT guidelines would enable greater confidence in these findings.

40|$|Explaining {{the concept}} <b>of</b> <b>randomisation</b> {{in simple terms}} to {{patients}} during the discussion of randomised clinical trials can be a difficult task for many health care professionals. We report {{the results of a}} questionnaire-based survey, using seven descriptions <b>of</b> <b>randomisation</b> taken from Corbett's study. We examined the preferences of the general public and patients towards the descriptions and compared the results with the clinicians' choice. Participants in the survey were 341 lay people without cancer, 200 patients with cancer and 200 oncologists from cancer centres throughout the UK. It was difficult to identify ‘the best’ way to describe the process <b>of</b> <b>randomisation.</b> The two most favoured statements for patients and members of the public included a very explicit statement that mentioned ‘a computer’, ‘chance’ and ‘not the doctor's or patient's decision’ and a succinct statement that played down the role of ‘chance’. Clinicians chose neither of these statements as closely resembling their own practice. Patients and members of the public most disliked the statement ‘a computer will perform the equivalent of tossing a coin to allocate you to one <b>of</b> two <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> treatment’. This analogy used by 26 % of oncologists, was viewed as trivialising and upsetting in the context of determining treatment for life threatening disease...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: There is good {{evidence}} that brief interventions from health professionals can increase rates of smoking cessation. A number of trials have examined whether specific skills training for health professionals {{leads them to}} have greater success in helping their patients who smoke. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review {{was to assess the}} effectiveness of training health care professionals to deliver smoking cessation interventions to their patients, and to assess the additional effects of prompts and reminders to the health professional to intervene. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for studies relating to training. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials in which the intervention was training of health care professionals in smoking cessation. Trials were considered if they reported outcomes for patient smoking rates at least six months after the intervention. We reported on process outcomes, but we excluded trials that reported effects only on process outcomes and not smoking behaviour. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data in duplicate on the type of health professionals, the nature of and duration of the training, the outcome measures, <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>randomisation,</b> and completeness of follow-up. The main outcome measures were 1. Rates of abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up in patients smoking at baseline. 2. Rates of performance of tasks of smoking cessation by health care professionals including offering counselling, setting quit dates, giving follow-up appointments, distributing self-help materials and recommending nicotine gum. MAIN RESULTS: Healthcare professionals who had received training were more likely to perform tasks of smoking cessation than untrained controls. Of eight studies that compared patient smoking behaviour between trained professionals and controls, six found no effect of intervention. The effects of training on process outcomes increased if prompts and reminders were used. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Training health professionals to provide smoking cessation interventions had a measurable effect on professional performance. There was no strong evidence that it changed smoking behaviour...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Silver acetate {{produces}} an unpleasant taste {{when combined with}} cigarettes, thereby producing an aversive stimulus. It has been marketed in various forms {{with the aim of}} extinguishing the urge to smoke, by pairing the urge with an unpleasant stimulus. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review was to determine the effectiveness of silver acetate products (gum, lozenge, spray) in promoting smoking cessation. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group specialised trials register. Most recent search was in July 2012. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised trials of silver acetate for smoking cessation with reports of smoking status at least six months after the beginning of treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data in duplicate on the type of subjects, the dose and form of silver acetate, the outcome measures, <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>randomisation,</b> and completeness of follow-up. The main outcome measure was biochemically validated abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up in patients smoking at baseline. Subjects lost to follow-up were counted as continuing smokers. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed effects model. MAIN RESULTS: Two studies provided long-term follow-up data on patients randomised to silver acetate or placebo. In one of these studies, there was a third arm, randomised to 2 mg nicotine gum. The pooled risk ratio for quitting for silver acetate vs placebo was 1. 04 (95 % confidence interval 0. 69 to 1. 57). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Existing trials show little evidence for a specific effect of silver acetate in promoting smoking cessation. The confidence intervals for the ratio are quite wide. However, the upper limit of the confidence intervals for a positive effect equates to an absolute increase in the smoking cessation rate of about 4 %. Any effect of this agent is therefore likely to be smaller than nicotine replacement therapy. The lack of effect of silver acetate may reflect poor compliance with a treatment whose rationale is to create an unpleasant stimulus...|$|E
40|$|Background Alcohol misuse {{in young}} people is a cause of concern for health services, policy makers, {{prevention}} workers, and criminal justice system, youth workers, teachers, and parents. Objectives To systematically review evidence {{on the effectiveness of}} universal family-based prevention programs in preventing alcohol misuse in school-aged children up to 18 years of age. To update a part of a previously published Cochrane systematic review. Search strategy Relevant evidence (up to 2002) was selected from the previous Cochrane review. Later studies, to July 2010, were identified from MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, Project CORK, and PsycINFO. Selection criteria Randomized trials evaluating universal family-based prevention programs and reporting outcomes for alcohol use in students 18 years of age or younger were included. Two reviewers screened titles/abstracts and full text of identified records. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers extracted relevant data independently using an a priori defined extraction form. Risk of bias was assessed. Main results 12 parallel-group trials were included. The reporting quality of trials was poor, only 20 % of them reporting adequate <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>randomisation</b> and program allocation concealment. Incomplete data was adequately addressed in about half of the trials and this information was unclear for about 30 % of the trials. Due to extensive heterogeneity across interventions, populations, and outcomes, the results were summarized only qualitatively. 9 of the 12 trials showed some evidence of effectiveness compared to a control or other intervention group, with persistence of effects over the medium and longer-term. Four of these effective interventions were gender-specific, focusing on young females. One study with a small sample size showed positive effects that were not statistically significant, and two studies with larger sample sizes reported no significant effects of the family-based intervention for reducing alcohol misuse. Authors' conclusions In conclusion, in this Cochrane systematic review we found that that the effects of family-based prevention interventions are small but generally consistent and also persistent into the medium- to longer-term...|$|E

40|$|Background: The optimal {{glycaemic}} control {{target in}} pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes is unclear, {{although there is}} a clear link between high glucose concentrations and adverse birth outcomes. Objectives: To assess the effects of different intensities of glycaemic control in pregnant women with pre-existing type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 January 2016) and planned to search reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials comparing different glycaemic control targets in pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, conducted data extraction, assessed risk of bias and checked for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results: We included three trials, all in women with type 1 diabetes (223 women and babies). All three trials were at high risk of bias due to lack <b>of</b> blinding, unclear <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>randomisation</b> and selective reporting of outcomes. Two trials compared very tight (3. 33 to 5. 0 mmol/L fasting blood glucose (FBG)) with tight-moderate (4. 45 to 6. 38 mmol/L) glycaemic control targets, with one trial of 22 babies reporting no perinatal deaths orserious perinatal morbidity (evidence graded low for both outcomes). In the same trial, there were two congenital anomalies in the very tight, and none in the tight-moderate group, with no significant differences in caesarean section between groups (risk ratio (RR) 0. 92, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 49 to 1. 73; evidence graded very low). In these two trials, glycaemic control was not significantly different between the very tight and tight-moderate groups by the third trimester, although one trial of 22 women found significantly less maternal hypoglycaemia in the tight-moderate group. In a trial of 60 women and babies comparing tight (≤ 5. 6 mmol/L FBG); moderate (5. 6 to 6. 7 mmol/L); and loose (6. 7 to 8. 9 mmol/L) glycaemic control targets, there were two neonatal deaths in the loose and none in the tight or moderate groups (evidence graded very low). There were significantly fewer women with pre-eclampsia (evidence graded low), fewer caesarean sections (evidence graded low) and fewer babies with birthweights greater than 90 th centile (evidence graded low) in the combined tight-moderate compared with the loose group. The quality of the evidence was graded low or very low for important outcomes, because of design limitations to the studies, the small numbers of women included, and wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect. Many of the important outcomes were not reported in these studies. Authors' conclusions: In a very limited body of evidence, few differences in outcomes were seen between very tight and tight-moderate glycaemic control targets in pregnant women with pre-existing type 1 diabetes, including actual glycaemic control achieved. There is evidence of harm (increased pre-eclampsia, caesareans and birthweights greater than 90 th centile) for 'loose' control (FBG above 7 mmol/L). Future trials comparing interventions, rather than glycaemic control targets, may be more feasible. Trials in pregnant women with pre-existing type 2 diabetes are required.
