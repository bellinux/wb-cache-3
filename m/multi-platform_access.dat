This is lead {{by the idea of}} sharing resources (instruments in this use-case) between entities, each exploiting of course their own information system. Mainly, to be generic enough to satisfy the corresponding genericity of resources addressed, the sharing must be done under certain constraints, which are security, scalability, authentication, ”real time” <b>access,</b> <b>Multi-Platform</b> and Multi-Users <b>access.</b> The purpose of the article is to discuss the possible use of Web services for the skeleton of such a generic framework, with the issue of providing an adapted service to the user depending on the context of utilization (i. e. depending on the role the user is playing in the session) ...|$|R

5000|$|Bitcasa {{provided}} {{client software}} for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Android and web browsers. An iOS client was pending Apple approval. [...] Its former product, Infinite Drive, once provided centralized storage that included unlimited capacity, client-side encryption, media streaming, file versioning and backups, and <b>multi-platform</b> mobile <b>access.</b> In 2013 Bitcasa {{moved to a}} tiered storage model, offering from 1TB for $99/year up to Infinite for $999/year. In October 2014, Bitcasa announced the discontinuation of Infinite Drive; for $999/year, users would get 10TB of storage. Infinite Drive users {{would be required to}} migrate to one of the new pricing plans or delete their account. In May 2016, Bitcasa discontinued offering cloud storage for consumers, alleging that they will be focusing on their business products.|$|R

5000|$|On August 5, 2014, the {{original}} Justin.tv site was abruptly shut down, citing {{a need to}} focus resources entirely on Twitch. On August 6, 2014, Twitch introduced an updated archive system, with <b>multi-platform</b> <b>access</b> to highlights from past broadcasts by a channel, higher quality video, increased server backups, and a new Video Manager interface for managing past broadcasts and compiling [...] "highlights" [...] from broadcasts that can also be exported to YouTube. Due to technological limitations and resource requirements, the new system contained several regressions; the option to archive complete broadcasts on an indefinite basis ("save forever") was removed, meaning that they can only be retained for a maximum of 14 days, or 60 for partners and Turbo subscribers. While compiled highlights can be archived indefinitely, they were limited to two hours in length. Additionally, all on-demand videos became subject to acoustic fingerprinting using software provided by Audible Magic; if copyrighted music (particularly, songs played by users from outside of the game they are playing) is detected, the 30-minute portion of the video which contains the music will be muted. Live broadcasts {{are not subject to}} these filters.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} an Information Valet ("iValet"), an approach for combining <b>multi-platform</b> <b>access</b> to heterogeneous information with adaption to user preferences. The goal of an iValet is to support access to a range of information sources from a range of wired and wireless client devices with some degree of uniformity. An iValet should be aware of its user and user devices, learning from a user's past interactions where and how to send new incoming information. Our metaphor is that of a valet that sits between a user's client devices and the information services that the user may want to access. This paper describes a prototype iValet that interacts with its user through both the Palm VII "Web-clippings" service and the RIM 950 two-way email-capable pager, providing access to email, Web pages, and personal files. We discuss general issues raised by our work concerning the more general design of an iValet, and present initial results concerning the ability of machine [...] ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{details the}} {{research}} and development of a versatile electronic monitoring and control platform, influenced by the Internet of Things (IoT), mass configurability, modularity, expandability and ease of use. The generic framework which has been designed and tested aims to provide a platform to build a wide variety of specialised systems to integrate sensors and actuators. A central processing unit manages modular hardware devices connected by a serial network. Only the required hardware units are chosen to constitute a system for an application. The processing unit uses modular task handlers to manage the system. The web-based user interface provides <b>multi-platform</b> system <b>access</b> using a web browser. The website is dynamically generated from the system configuration. While the framework is generic, for testing its efficacy, it was applied to a seed and fertilizer spreader to monitor and control the application rate. This application requires coordinated control of actuators using inputs from multiple sources, including sensors, machine states, a database, other processing tasks, and the operator. The implementation was successful in achieving reliable control of the seeding rate, based on the tractor ground speed. The practical implementation exhibited a high level of expandability and modularity. The prototype system has also highlighted a few issues which can be addressed in future revisions to improve the versatility and robustness of the framework...|$|R
