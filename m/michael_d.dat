5|$|A monohedral tiling is a {{tessellation}} {{in which}} all tiles are congruent; it has only one prototile. A particularly interesting type of monohedral tessellation is the spiral monohedral tiling. The first spiral monohedral tiling was discovered by Heinz Voderberg in 1936; the Voderberg tiling has a unit tile that is a nonconvex enneagon. The Hirschhorn tiling, published by <b>Michael</b> <b>D.</b> Hirschhorn and D. C. Hunt in 1985, is a pentagon tiling using irregular pentagons: regular pentagons cannot tile the Euclidean plane as the internal angle of a regular pentagon, , is not a divisor of 2.|$|E

5|$|In {{his book}} Popular Contemporary Writers, <b>Michael</b> <b>D.</b> Sharp {{describes}} Vonnegut's linguistic style as straightforward; his sentences concise, his language simple, his paragraphs brief, and his ordinary tone conversational. Vonnegut uses this style to convey normally complex subject matter {{in a way}} that is intelligible to a large audience. He credited his time as a journalist for his ability, pointing to his work with the Chicago City News Bureau, which required him to convey stories in telephone conversations. Vonnegut's compositions are also laced with distinct references to his own life, notably in Slaughterhouse-Five and Slapstick.|$|E
5|$|Shark {{researchers}} <b>Michael</b> <b>D.</b> Gottfried, Leonard Compagno, and S. Curtis Bowman {{proposed a}} linear {{relationship between a}} shark's total length and {{the height of the}} largest upper anterior tooth.

5|$|As the {{disaster}} in New Orleans intensified, critics charged that Bush was misrepresenting his administration's role {{in what they}} saw as a flawed response. Leaders attacked Bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA, notably <b>Michael</b> <b>D.</b> Brown; it was also argued that the federal response was limited {{as a result of the}} Iraq War and Bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods. Bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government's failures in its handling of the emergency. It has been argued that with Katrina, Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover.|$|E

Jerry promises that George can have it, but leaves it in his apartment for a few days. Kramer takes a few of Irving's old clothes, including a hat which he believes makes him look like Joe Friday of Dragnet. Elaine persuades Jerry to have his apartment cleaned by her client Rava's (Nurit Koppel) boyfriend Ray (<b>Michael</b> <b>D.</b> Conway). Jerry is very impressed {{by the quality of}} the cleaning; but when he and Elaine visit Rava, Jerry notices a statue with a vivid similarity to the one he inherited, and believes Ray stole it.

5|$|The {{nomination}} in April 2005 {{of a new}} NASA Administrator with an engineering rather than accounting background, <b>Michael</b> <b>D.</b> Griffin, changed the situation, as Griffin stated he would consider a manned servicing mission. Soon after his appointment Griffin authorized Goddard to proceed with preparations for a manned Hubble maintenance flight, saying he would make the final decision after the next two shuttle missions. In October 2006 Griffin gave the final go-ahead, and the 11-day mission by Atlantis was scheduled for October 2008. Hubble's main data-handling unit failed in September 2008, halting all reporting of scientific data until its back-up was brought online on October 25, 2008. Since {{a failure of the}} backup unit would leave the HST helpless, the service mission was postponed to incorporate a replacement for the primary unit.|$|E

Higgins was {{put forward by}} Labour, McGuinness was put forward by Sinn Féin and Mitchell was put forward by Fine Gael. The previously dominant Fianna Fáil party declined to put forward an official candidate following their disastrous general election campaign earlier that year. Norris, a civil rights campaigner credited with helping overthrow Ireland's laws criminalising homosexuality, was the leading candidate {{for much of the}} race, and had more than double the support of the other declared candidates in January 2011. He withdrew in August 2011 but returned to the race the following month due to his continuing widespread popular appeal.|$|E
5|$|In November 1967, the LDS Church asked Hugh Nibley, a {{professor}} of ancient scripture at Brigham Young University (BYU), to study the fragments. Nibley was a polyglot, but not an Egyptologist, and subsequently studied under John A. Wilson {{in an attempt to}} learn enough about Egyptian hieroglyphics to translate them himself., he had begun to study Egyptian in Chicago with Dr. John A. Wilson". The LDS Church published sepia photographs of the papyri in its magazine Improvement Era in February 1968, although a translation was not provided at the time. The editors of an independent quarterly journal, , arranged for and published translations of the papyri courtesy of several Egyptologists and scholars, including: John A. Wilson (University of Chicago, Oriental Institute), Richard Anthony Parker (Director of the Department of Egyptology, Brown University), Klaus Baer (University of Chicago, Oriental Institute), and Jerald Tanner (independent scholar). Other translations and analyses have been performed at various times since 1968 by Mormon and non-Mormon scholars, including <b>Michael</b> <b>D.</b> Rhodes (BYU), John Gee (BYU), and Robert K. Ritner (University of Chicago).|$|E
5|$|In a study {{published}} in 1979 in Advances in the Study of Affect, vol. 5, and in another article using the same data and published in 1980 in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, <b>Michael</b> <b>D.</b> Storms of the University of Kansas outlined his own reimagining of the Kinsey scale. Whereas Kinsey measured sexual orientation based on a combination of actual sexual behavior and fantasizing and eroticism, Storms used only fantasizing and eroticism. Storms, however, placed hetero-eroticism and homo-eroticism on separate axes rather than at two ends of a single scale; this allows for a distinction between bisexuality (exhibiting both hetero- and homo-eroticism in degrees comparable to hetero- or homosexuals, respectively) and asexuality (exhibiting a level of homo-eroticism comparable to a heterosexual and a level of hetero-eroticism comparable to a homosexual, namely, little to none). This type of scale accounted for asexuality for the first time. Storms conjectured that many researchers following Kinsey's model could be mis-categorizing asexual subjects as bisexual, because both were simply defined by a lack of preference for gender in sexual partners.|$|E
