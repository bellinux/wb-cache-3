For the full year, GDP rose by 2. 6 percent, well below expectations. A significant part of the shortfall reflected a shift to a chain-weighted methodologyâ€”growth on the old methodology was 3. 6 percent. Pressure on labor markets from job shedding is slowly abating. Progress in corporate restructuring continues. Cash flow and profits remain buoyant; bankruptcies have fallen to a 10 -year low and leverage continues to decline.

40|$|Using a duopoly {{model in}} which one home firm and one foreign firm compete in a third country market, this paper {{analyses}} how environmental regulation affects the optimal <b>commercial</b> <b>policy</b> and the strategic use of environmental policy. In particular, this paper reviews the typical outcome that environmental regulation reduces welfare {{in the absence of}} <b>commercial</b> <b>policy</b> and that, in order to maximise welfare, a stronger <b>commercial</b> <b>policy</b> is required when firms compete in quantities, while when competition is in prices policy should be weaker. The paper also pays attention to the outcome that the strategic use of environmental policy consists of weakening it in the former case and strengthening it in the latter one. Considering that environmental regulation is determined by the bargaining between that sector of society concerned with the environment and the polluting firm, this paper proves that under price competition environmental regulation may be welfare improving in the absence of <b>commercial</b> <b>policy.</b> In such a case, the optimal policy is not necessarily an export tax but may be an export subsidy or, under particular conditions, free trade. strategic <b>commercial</b> <b>policy,</b> quantities competition, price competition, environmental regulation. ...|$|R

40|$|Summary: This article {{examines}} how the substantive changes {{brought by the}} Lisbon Treaty {{with regard to the}} scope and nature of Community competence and to decision-making rules in the field of the Common <b>Commercial</b> <b>Policy</b> fulfil the need for balancing internal and external action and stand up to the requirements of international economic regulation. It is argued that the Lisbon Treaty, building upon the premises of the current regime, constitutes a benchmark {{in the evolution of the}} Common <b>Commercial</b> <b>Policy.</b> The expansion of the scope of the Common <b>Commercial</b> <b>Policy</b> to trade in services, commercial aspects of intellectual property and, most importantly, foreign direct investment indicates that a common policy in the fields of goods, services, establishment and capital with regard to third countries is necessary in order to serve the goals of internal integration and to increase the competitiveness of Europe in the world. Furthermore, by “merging” the different aspects of the Common <b>Commercial</b> <b>Policy</b> and simplifying the provisions concerning the exercise of EU competence, the Lisbon Treaty ensures its effective application. However, the “merger” of the different aspects of the Common <b>Commercial</b> <b>Policy</b> does not affect the balance of powers that exists in the internal market with regard to the same areas of law. The only derogations from parallelism between internal and external powers concern the exclusive nature of EU competence and the role of the European Parliament. However, these are both necessary for preserving the effectiveness of Union policy and introducing legitimacy in the most important field of EU external relations...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the implications of}} international returns to scale and globalization of production for <b>commercial</b> <b>policy.</b> Though national returns justify subsidization for small countries, the first-best policy for small countries acting on their own under international returns is free trade.

These emerged from his attack on mainstream equilibrium analyses as applied to underdevelopment. In reacting to this attack, the mainstream drew upon its theory of <b>commercial</b> <b>policy,</b> and classified him as a protectionist and supporter of import-substituting industrialization. This paper clarifies that he was in support of both export promotion and import substitution. He also showed a good awareness of the desirability in different contexts of the main trade-policy instruments, but was by no means reaching knee-jerk conclusions in ranking them as the subscribers to the theory of <b>commercial</b> <b>policy</b> do. This is in harmony with his concept of development as involving an upward movement of the entire social system, including the recognition that trade policy is only one component of any development plan and that there have to be domestic reforms as well.

40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{challenges}} and opportunities confronting the European Union in its trade and broader <b>commercial</b> <b>policies,</b> in what {{is a period of}} transition. The article begins by evaluating the foundations of the EU’s ‘actorness’ in trade policy, and in particular by identifying three underlying logics of EU policy development: the ‘internal’ logic, the ‘external’ logic and the ‘identity’ logic. The interaction between these logics is seen as driving {{the ways in which the}} EU enters into global trade relationships, and as accounting for tensions and contradictions in a number of areas. Subsequent sections of the article deal with the images presented by the EU in trade policy, with the EU’s changing position in world trade, with the current trade agenda and the new agenda of broader <b>commercial</b> <b>policy.</b> The article finishes with a review of potential future issues in EU trade and <b>commercial</b> <b>policies,</b> and with a reassessment of the ‘three logics’ and their interaction...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyses}} the EU’s Common <b>Commercial</b> <b>Policy</b> (CCP) at {{the level}} of Treaty revision and particularly focuses on the last Treaty negotiations that led to the Treaty of Lisbon. The analysis is based on a revised neofunctionalist framework that the author developed in previous work. It draws on the following concepts: (i) functional spillover; (ii) cultivated spillover; (iii) social spillover; and (iv) countervailing forces. Insights into the dynamics and countervailing forces driving Treaty revisions considerably deepen our understanding of the Common <b>Commercial</b> <b>Policy,</b> as EU external trade policy-making is substantially affected by the parameters set by the Treaty. The analysis indicates that the revised neofunctionalist framework can broadly account for the changes of the Common <b>Commercial</b> <b>Policy</b> during the last Treaty revision. It is further suggested that integration in the area of trade policy cannot be explained exclusively by rational choice dynamics, such as utility maximizing actors with fixed preferences, but that socialization through deliberation also needs to be taken into account...|$|R
