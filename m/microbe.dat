5|$|MFGM {{bioactive}} protein components, including the glycoproteins lactadherin, MUC-1, and butyrophilin, {{have been shown}} in preclinical studies to affect immune response. These components influence the immune system by several mechanisms, including interference with <b>microbe</b> adhesion to intestinal epithelia, bacteriocidal action, support of beneficial microbiota, and modulation of {{other parts of the}} immune system.|$|E
5|$|Exocytosis in prokaryotes: Membrane {{vesicular}} exocytosis, {{popularly known}} as membrane vesicle trafficking, a Nobel prize-winning (year, 2013) process, is traditionally regarded as a prerogative of eukaryotic cells. This myth was however broken with the revelation that nanovesicles, {{popularly known as}} bacterial outer membrane vesicles, released by gram-negative microbes, translocate bacterial signal molecules to host or target cells to carry out multiple processes in favour of the secreting <b>microbe</b> e.g., in host cell invasion and microbe-environment interactions, in general.|$|E
40|$|<b>Microbes</b> {{have the}} {{potential}} to be important selective forces in many aspects of avian biology. <b>Microbes</b> can affect fitness as a result of either their pathogenic or beneficial effects on host health. Little is known about the chronology of microbial colonization of nestlings or the effects of <b>microbes</b> on fledgling condition. We set out to (1) characterize the time course of microbial colonization of the cloacae of nestling Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), (2) examine the relationship between cloacal <b>microbes</b> and fledgling condition, and (3) determine if nest mates had similar assemblages of cloacal <b>microbes.</b> We repeatedly measured nestlings and sampled their cloacal <b>microbes</b> on nestling days 2, 3, 5, 7, 12, 16, and 19. We detected cloacal <b>microbes</b> in nestlings as early as nestling day 2. Colonization of nestlings by <b>microbes</b> began soon after hatching. Nestlings were colonized by more types of <b>microbes</b> and carried heavier loads of most types of <b>microbes</b> as they got older. Cloacal <b>microbes</b> did not affect fledgling success. However, plate scores for gram-negative enteric lactose fermentors, which include E. coli, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp., were positively correlated with a greater degree of wing asymmetry. This relationship suggests that <b>microbes</b> affect fledgling survival because wing asymmetry hinders flying ability, a critical survival skill for these aerial insectivores. Patterns in the assemblages of cloacal <b>microbes</b> within broods suggested host-genetic influences on the colonization of nestlings by <b>microbes,</b> but they also may have reflected the facts that nest mates were fed by the same adults and were raised in the same nests...|$|R

5|$|In September 2009, {{the most}} common type of <b>microbe</b> on the surface of Lake Chillisquaque was Oscillatoria, which made up {{approximately}} 75 percent of the total.

Slightly less than 10 percent of the microbes are Anabaena. In July 2010, Oscillatoria and Synechococcus each made up approximately 25 percent of the microbes and between 10 and 15 percent were Anabaena.|$|E
5|$|Microbes {{feature in}} many highly dramatized films. Hollywood {{was quick to}} exploit the {{possibilities}} of deadly disease, mass infection and drastic government reaction, starting as early as 1922 with Nosferatu, in which a Dracula-like figure, Count Orlok, sleeps in unhallowed ground contaminated with the Black Death, which he brings with him wherever he goes. Another classic film, Ingmar Bergman's 1957 The Seventh Seal, deals with the plague theme very differently, with the grim reaper directly represented by an actor in a hood. More recently, the 1971 The Andromeda Strain, based on a novel by Michael Crichton, portrayed an extraterrestrial <b>microbe</b> contaminating the Earth.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} evolutionary theory before Darwin's {{was that of}} Jean-Baptiste Lamarck; based on the inheritance of acquired characteristics (an inheritance mechanism that was widely accepted until the 20th century), it described a chain of development stretching from the lowliest <b>microbe</b> to humans. The British naturalist Charles Darwin, combining the biogeographical approach of Humboldt, the uniformitarian geology of Lyell, Thomas Malthus's writings on population growth, and his own morphological expertise, created a more successful evolutionary theory based on natural selection; similar evidence led Alfred Russel Wallace to independently reach the same conclusions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Microbes</b> {{are part}} of every ecosystem. They form the {{foundation}} of many food webs. <b>Microbes</b> are eaten by animals, which then serve as food sources for other animals and plants. <b>Microbes</b> also play {{an important part in}} breaking down dead plant and animal material through decomposition. <b>Microbes</b> are involved in the cycling of nutrients and other compounds throughout the environment. For example, <b>microbes</b> in the soil decompose the plant and animal matter in the rainforest creating a rich and fertile growing environment.|$|R
25|$|Cimex lectularius {{males have}} {{environmental}} <b>microbes</b> on their genitals. These <b>microbes</b> damage sperm cells, leaving them unable to fertilize female gametes. Due to these dangerous <b>microbes,</b> males have evolved antimicrobial ejaculate substances that prevent sperm damage. When the <b>microbes</b> contact sperm or the male genitals, the bed bug releases antimicrobial substances. Many species of these <b>microbes</b> {{live in the}} bodies of females after mating. The <b>microbes</b> can cause infections in the females. It {{has been suggested that}} females receive benefit from the ejaculate. Though the benefit is not direct, females are able to produce more eggs than optimum increasing the amount of the females' genes in the gene pool.|$|R

5|$|Biomes {{are larger}} units of {{organization}} that categorize {{regions of the}} Earth's ecosystems, mainly according to the structure and composition of vegetation. There are different methods to define the continental boundaries of biomes dominated by different functional types of vegetative communities that are limited in distribution by climate, precipitation, weather and other environmental variables. Biomes include tropical rainforest, temperate broadleaf and mixed forest, temperate deciduous forest, taiga, tundra, hot desert, and polar desert. Other researchers have recently categorized other biomes, such as the human and oceanic microbiomes. To a <b>microbe,</b> {{the human body is}} a habitat and a landscape. Microbiomes were discovered largely through advances in molecular genetics, which have revealed a hidden richness of microbial diversity on the planet. The oceanic microbiome plays {{a significant role in the}} ecological biogeochemistry of the planet's oceans.|$|E
5|$|In humans, this {{response}} is activated by complement binding to antibodies that have attached to these microbes or the binding of complement proteins to carbohydrates on {{the surfaces of}} microbes. This recognition signal triggers a rapid killing response. The speed of the response {{is a result of}} signal amplification that occurs after sequential proteolytic activation of complement molecules, which are also proteases. After complement proteins initially bind to the <b>microbe,</b> they activate their protease activity, which in turn activates other complement proteases, and so on. This produces a catalytic cascade that amplifies the initial signal by controlled positive feedback. The cascade results in the production of peptides that attract immune cells, increase vascular permeability, and opsonize (coat) the surface of a pathogen, marking it for destruction. This deposition of complement can also kill cells directly by disrupting their plasma membrane.|$|E
5|$|Many {{microbes}} {{have been}} proposed as triggers of MS, but none have been confirmed. Moving {{at an early age}} from one location in the world to another alters a person's subsequent risk of MS. An explanation for this could be that some kind of infection, produced by a widespread <b>microbe</b> rather than a rare one, is related to the disease. Proposed mechanisms include the hygiene hypothesis and the prevalence hypothesis. The hygiene hypothesis proposes that exposure to certain infectious agents early in life is protective, the disease being a response to a late encounter with such agents. The prevalence hypothesis proposes that the disease is due to an infectious agent more common in regions where MS is common and where in most individuals it causes an ongoing infection without symptoms. Only in a few cases and after many years does it cause demyelination. The hygiene hypothesis has received more support than the prevalence hypothesis.|$|E

5|$|Those {{cells that}} {{recognize}} coated pathogens have Fc receptors, which, {{as the name}} suggests, interact with the Fc region of IgA, IgG, and IgE antibodies. The engagement of a particular antibody with the Fc receptor on a particular cell triggers an effector function of that cell; phagocytes will phagocytose, mast cells and neutrophils will degranulate, natural killer cells will release cytokines and cytotoxic molecules; that will ultimately result in destruction of the invading <b>microbe.</b> The activation of natural killer cells by antibodies initiates a cytotoxic mechanism known as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) – this process may explain the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies used in biological therapies against cancer. The Fc receptors are isotype-specific, which gives greater flexibility to the immune system, invoking only the appropriate immune mechanisms for distinct pathogens.|$|E

40|$|A longstanding {{hypothesis}} in intestinal {{microbial ecology}} is that autochthonous <b>microbes</b> (resident) {{play a role}} that is distinct from allochthonous <b>microbes</b> (transient <b>microbes</b> in the fecal stream).

This area contains transverse folds that mimic human intestinal folds and contains a distinct population of intestinal <b>microbes</b> {{that is associated with}} the mucosa. Our analysis of bacterial 16 S rRNA genes showed that this area was enriched for Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae. In this addendum, we further compare this community to studies of mucosa-associated <b>microbes</b> in humans. This analysis reveals common phylogenetic groups of bacteria that are present in both mouse and human. However, we found microorganisms at the genus and species levels including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii which appears to be specific for humans.
