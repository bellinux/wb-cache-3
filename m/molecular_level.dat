5|$|The field {{grew from}} 19th century beginnings, where {{embryology}} faced a mystery: zoologists {{did not know}} how embryonic development was controlled at the <b>molecular</b> <b>level.</b> Charles Darwin noted that having similar embryos implied common ancestry, but little progress was made until the 1970s.

5|$|This {{synthesis}} cemented {{natural selection}} {{as the foundation}} of evolutionary theory, where it remains today. A second synthesis was brought about {{at the end of the}} 20th century by advances in molecular genetics, creating the field of evolutionary developmental biology ("evo-devo"), which seeks to explain the evolution of form in terms of the genetic regulatory programs which control the development of the embryo at <b>molecular</b> <b>level.</b> Natural selection is here understood to act on embryonic development to change the morphology of the adult body.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to being a major source of variation, mutation may also function as a mechanism of evolution when there are different probabilities at the <b>molecular</b> <b>level</b> for different mutations to occur, a process known as mutation bias. If two genotypes, for example one with the nucleotide G and another with the nucleotide A in the same position, have the same fitness, but mutation from G to A happens more often than mutation from A to G, then genotypes with A will tend to evolve. Different insertion vs. deletion mutation biases in different taxa can lead to the evolution of different genome sizes. Developmental or mutational biases have also been observed in morphological evolution. For example, according to the phenotype-first theory of evolution, mutations can eventually cause the genetic assimilation of traits that were previously induced by the environment.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{is one of}} the cornerstones of modern biology. The concept, published by Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in a joint presentation of papers in 1858, was elaborated in Darwin's influential 1859 book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, which described natural selection as analogous to artificial selection, a process by which animals and plants with traits considered desirable by human breeders are systematically favoured for reproduction. The concept of natural selection originally developed {{in the absence of a}} valid theory of heredity; at the time of Darwin's writing, science had yet to develop modern theories of genetics. The union of traditional Darwinian evolution with subsequent discoveries in classical genetics formed the modern synthesis of the mid-20th century. The addition of molecular genetics has led to evolutionary developmental biology, which explains evolution at the <b>molecular</b> <b>level.</b> While genotypes can slowly change by random genetic drift, natural selection remains the primary explanation for adaptive evolution.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the relationship between}} psychological capacities, as they are understood within cognitive psychology, and neurobiological activities. First, Lycan’s (1987) account of this relationship is examined and certain problems with his account are explained. According to Lycan, psychological capacities occupy a higher level than neurobiological activities in a hierarchy of levels of nature, and psychological entities can be decomposed into neurobiological ones. In {{the second half of}} this paper, an alternative account is laid out. This new account uses levels of organization and levels of explanation to create a two-dimensional model. Psy-chological capacities occupy a high level of explanation relative to the cellular and <b>molecular</b> <b>levels</b> of organization. Consequently, according to this model, psycho-logical capacities are a particular way of describing the activities that occur at the cellular and <b>molecular</b> <b>levels</b> of organization. ...|$|R

5|$|The middle {{decades of}} the 20th century saw the rise of {{molecular}} biology, and with it {{an understanding of the}} chemical nature of genes as sequences of DNA and of their relationship—through the genetic code—to protein sequences. At the same time, increasingly powerful techniques for analyzing proteins, such as protein electrophoresis and sequencing, brought biochemical phenomena into realm of the synthetic theory of evolution. In the early 1960s, biochemists Linus Pauling and Emile Zuckerkandl proposed the molecular clock hypothesis (MCH): that sequence differences between homologous proteins could be used to calculate the time since two species diverged. By 1969, Motoo Kimura and others provided a theoretical basis for the molecular clock, arguing that—at the <b>molecular</b> <b>level</b> at least—most genetic mutations are neither harmful nor helpful and that mutation and genetic drift (rather than natural selection) cause a large portion of genetic change: the neutral theory of molecular evolution. Studies of protein differences within species also brought molecular data to bear on population genetics by providing estimates of the level of heterozygosity in natural populations.|$|E
