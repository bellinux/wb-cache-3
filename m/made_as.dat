5|$|AC/DC {{underwent}} several line-up changes before releasing {{their first}} album, High Voltage, in 1975.

Within months of recording the album Highway to Hell, lead singer and co-songwriter Bon Scott died on 19 February 1980 {{after a night of}} heavy alcohol consumption. The group considered disbanding, but buoyed by support from Scott's parents, decided to continue and set about finding a new vocalist. Ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson was auditioned and selected to replace Scott. Later that year, the band released the new album, Back in Black, which was <b>made</b> <b>as</b> a tribute to Bon Scott. The album launched them to new heights of success and became their all-time best-seller.|$|E

During {{the evaluation of}} the U-3 class conducted by the Navy, the class' poor diving and handling characteristics were noted. To alleviate the diving problems, U-3s fins were changed in size and shape several times, and eventually, the front diving planes were removed and a stationary stern flap was affixed to the hull. U-3 served as a training boat between 1910 and 1914 and <b>made</b> <b>as</b> many as ten cruises per month in that capacity.|$|E

The {{employees of the}} company unionized and began to demand wage increases beyond what Haynes believed was fair. The threat of labor strikes and Haynes' desire to avoid the problem led him to sell the company to Union Carbide on April 10, 1920, in exchange for 25,000 shares of Union Carbide stock valued at $2million. He later made an additional half million from dividends. Other details of the deal were never made public, and Haynes may have <b>made</b> <b>as</b> much $4million on the sale.

5|$|Both the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} and the dodo are now extinct. A common {{threshold of}} the extinction of the dodo is 1662, but some possible sightings had been <b>made</b> <b>as</b> late as 1688. The last sighting with a description was in 1662, but a statistical analysis by Roberts and Solow found that the extinction of the dodo was in 1693. The Rodrigues solitaire was killed off later than the dodo. The IUCN uses an extinction date of 1778 for the solitaire, although a more probable date {{would be in the}} 1750s or 1760s. Both birds became extinct as a consequence of human hunting and the introduction of mammals that ate the birds and their eggs.|$|E

The story focuses on themes of brotherhood and friendship, and was designed to give players glimpses into the personal lives and personalities of the characters that would not have fitted within the game.|$|E

After high school, Brown matriculated to the University of Kentucky, where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1957 and a law degree in 1960.
