This paper examines the experiences of Universitas Terbuka (UT), which has initiated and implemented an innovative strategy of quality assurance (QA) for continuous improvement. The credo of the UT quality assurance system is "We write what we do. We do what we write. We check. We improve continuously!" Implementing a quality management system at the UT, a mega-university with a student body of more than a quarter of a million and which involved a network of participating institutions and regional centres, was a formidable task to accomplish. To achieve its lofty goal, UT adopted and contextualised the draft of the Asian Association of Open Universities (AAOU) QA Framework to launch its own quality assurance program. This has taken a great deal of commitment and participation of all staff involved. QA at the UT required systematic and step-by-step processes, including development of the QA framework and job <b>manuals,</b> <b>raising</b> awareness and commitment amongst all staff involved, internal assessment, and integration of QA programs into the university's annual action plans, external assessment and benchmarking. This paper concludes that quality assurance must be developed as institutional policy and strategy for continuous improvement...|$|R

The EMCDDA has been collecting information on retail drug prices via its Reitox focal points for the last 15 years. Although considerable {{progress has been made in}} this area, there is still variation in data collection in Europe. To address this issue, the EMCDDA has released these Guidelines for collecting data on retail drug prices in Europe: issues and challenges in its Manuals series. The <b>Manual</b> <b>raises</b> awareness on specific issues related to collecting data on retail drug prices and offers practical suggestions.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the contribution of working alliance and other treatment variables to manual-based CBT for social anxiety disorder. Alliance, a common therapy factor, has been discussed in traditional psychotherapy literature and has recently received attention due to its correlation with outcome across different therapy methods. The broad circulation of treatment <b>manuals</b> <b>raised</b> concerns that the emphasis on specific techniques may impede the therapeutic relationship. The rationale for choosing social anxiety disorder included the serious nature of the disorder, the availability of an effective treatment protocol, and the cognitive biases and interpersonal difficulties inherent to the disorder. This {{study examined}} the utility of pre-treatment depression, treatment credibility and expectancy, and homework compliance as factors associated with outcome. Both a clinician-rated severity measure of distress and functional impairment and a self-report fear of negative evaluation scale {{were used to assess}} treatment gains. This study was conducted {{in the context of a}} wait-list controlled trial of individual cognitive-behavioral social anxiety disorder treatment. Results indicated that treatment significantly reduced symptom severity, fear of negative evaluation, and depressive symptomatology. Despite cognitive biases and interpersonal difficulties, participants had alliance ratings equivalent to general outpatient samples. After controlling for pre-treatment severity, working alliance after the final session was related to the post-treatment clinician-rated severity measure. This relationship suggested that working alliance developed in the context of improving in treatment, refuting a causal role for alliance. After controlling for pre-treatment scores, initial depression severity significantly contributed to post-treatment fear of negative evaluation model in the intent to treat sample. This relationship suggested the importance of considering comorbid depressive symptoms in treatment. However, initial levels of depression were not associated with outcome in individuals who completed treatment. Treatment implications, study limitations, and future directions were discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Direct touch {{manipulation}} with displays {{has become}} one of the primary means by which people interact with computers. Exploration of new interaction methods that work in unity with the standard direct manipulation paradigm will be of bene t for the many users of such an input paradigm. In many instances of direct interaction, both the eyes and hands play an integral role in accomplishing the user's interaction goals. The eyes visually select objects, and the hands physically manipulate them. In principle this process includes a two-step selection of the same object: users rst look at the target, and then move their hand to it for the actual selection. This thesis explores human-computer interactions where the principle of direct touch input is fundamentally changed through the use of eye-tracking technology. The change we investigate is a general reduction to a one-step selection process. The need to select using the hands can be eliminated by utilising eye-tracking to enable users to select an object of interest using their eyes only, by simply looking at it. Users then employ their hands for manipulation of the selected object, however they can manipulate it from anywhere as the selection is rendered independent of the hands. When a spatial o set exists between the hands and the object, the user's manual input is indirect. This allows users to manipulate any object they see from any manual input position. This fundamental change can have a substantial e ect on the many human-computer interactions that involve user input through direct manipulation, such as temporary touchscreen interactions. However it is unclear if, when, and how it can become bene cial to users of such an interaction method. To approach these questions, our research in this topic is guided by the following two propositions. The rst proposition is that gaze input can transform a direct input modality such as touch to an indirect modality, and with it provide new and powerful interaction capabilities. We develop this proposition in context of our investigation on integrated gaze interactions within direct manipulation user interfaces. We rst regard eye gaze for generic multi-touch displays, introducing Gaze-Touch as a technique based on the division of labour: gaze selects and touch manipulates. We investigate this technique with a design space analysis, protyping of application examples, and an informal user evaluation. The proposition is further developed by an exploration of hybrid eye and hand inputs with a stylus, for precise and cursor based indirect control; with bimanual input, to rapidly issue input from two hands to gaze-selected objects; with tablets, where Gaze-Touch enables one-handed interaction across the whole screen with the same hand that holds the device; and free-hand gesture in virtual reality to interact with any viewed object at a distance located in the virtual scene. Overall, we demonstrate that using eye gaze to enable indirect input yields many interaction bene ts, such as whole-screen reachability, occlusion-free manipulation, high precision cursor input, and low physical e ort. Integration of eye gaze with <b>manual</b> input <b>raises</b> new questions about how it can complement, instead of replace, the direct interactions users are familiar with. This is important to allow users the choice between direct and indirect inputs as each a ords distinct pros and cons for the usability of human-computer interfaces. These two input forms are normally considered separately from each other, but here we investigate interactions that combine those within the same interface. In this context, the second proposition is that gaze and touch input enables new and seamless ways of combining direct and indirect forms of interaction. We develop this proposition by regarding multiple interaction tasks that a user usually perform in a sequence, or simultaneously. First, we introduce a method to enable users switching between both input forms by implicitly exploiting visual attention during manual input. Direct input is active when looking at the input, and otherwise users will manipulate the object they look at indirectly. A design application for typical drawing and vector-graphics tasks has been prototyped to illustrate and explore this principle. The application contributes many example use cases, where direct drawing activities are complemented with indirect menu actions, precise cursor inputs, and seamless context switching at a glance. We further develop the proposition by investigating simultaneous direct and indirect input by bimanual input, where each input is assigned to one hand. We present an empirical study with an in-depth analysis of using indirect navigation in one hand, and direct pen drawing on the other. We extend this input constellation to tablet devices, by designing compound techniques for use in a more naturalistic setting when one hand holds the device. The interactions show that many typical tablet scenarios, such as browsing, map navigation, homescreen selections, or image gallery, can be enhanced through exploiting eye gaze...|$|R
