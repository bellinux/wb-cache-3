5000|$|Mules are {{considered}} to be very tough and strong, with harness capacity dependent on the type of horse mare used to produce the <b>mule</b> <b>foal.</b> Because they are a hybrid animal and usually are infertile, separate breeding programs must also be maintained.|$|E
40|$|Infective larvae were {{harvested}} from {{a culture of}} eggs collected from adult Strongylus asini recovered from a free-ranging Burchell's zebra, Equus burchelli, in the Kruger National Park. Worm-free zebra, horse and donkey foals were successfully infested, but infestation failed in a <b>mule</b> <b>foal.</b> At slaughter, 117 - 125 days post-infestation, S. asini in their 4 th moult were recovered from the liver and portal veins. This is the first report of successful experimental infestation of these hosts with S. asini. The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 600 dpi.

50|$|Most {{blood groups}} {{do not produce}} a highly {{immunologic}} response when the mare is exposed from previous foals or through placental leakage of red blood cells. However, a few factors, such as Aa and Qa, do lead to a significant response and therefore account {{for the majority of}} cases of isoerythrolysis. Mares that are Aa- and Qa-negative are therefore most likely to produce a foal with this condition. This is most commonly seen in Thoroughbreds (19%) and Arabians. Additionally, <b>mule</b> <b>foals</b> are especially at risk due to an associated donkey factor. Immune mediated thrombocytopenia often occurs concurrently in <b>mule</b> <b>foals</b> suffering from neonatal isoerythrolysis.|$|R
50|$|Neonatal isoerythrolysis usually {{presents}} {{during the}} first 4 days of a foal's life, or 4-7 days in <b>mule</b> <b>foals.</b> It is a medical emergency and requires immediate veterinary attention to prevent further decline in health and subsequent death.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Respiratory {{diseases}} {{are common in}} young horses but {{little is known about}} such infections in <b>mule</b> <b>foals.</b> This study aimed to characterize Escherichia coli and Klebsiella sp. isolated from tracheal wash (TW) and fecal samples (FS) of <b>mule</b> <b>foals,</b> with or without cytological evidence of respiratory disease. Strains were analyzed against 13 antimicrobials, for presence of Extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), and virulence genes. Phylogrouping and Randomic (RAPD) -PCR profiles were used to evaluate their genetic relatedness. E. coli strains from TW and FS showed greatest resistance to tetracycline, while Klebsiella strains were mainly resistant to ampicillin; multidrug resistance and ESBL production were also detected. The blaCTX gene prevailed among the E. coli isolates, while the blaSHV gene was more frequently found in K. pneumoniae. The fimH gene was detected in most of the isolates and multiple virulence factors were identified in three E. coli isolates. Most of the E. coli isolates belonged to the B 1 phylogroup, but B 2 strains displayed more virulence genes. The RAPD assay revealed genetic diversity among strains and was able to distinguish FS isolates from TW isolates. Knowledge of the bacteria associated with the respiratory tract of <b>mule</b> <b>foals</b> is important in the treatment of sick animals...|$|R
40|$|Respiratory {{diseases}} {{are common in}} horses; however, {{there is a lack}} of information in the literature on respiratory disease affecting <b>mule</b> <b>foals.</b> The objective of this study was to investigate the presence of aerobic bacteria in tracheal wash samples from 20 <b>mule</b> <b>foals</b> up to 6 months of age, with and without clinical evidence of respiratory disease. Samples were collected via endoscopy in two separate occasions and sent for cytology, microbial culture, and PCR for detection of Rhodococcus equi. Based on clinical evidence, 32. 5 % (13 / 40) of the samples were obtained from <b>mule</b> <b>foals</b> displaying signs of a respiratory condition, whereas 50 % (20 / 40) of the samples showed cytologic evidence of respiratory tract infection. One hundred percent of samples provided positive cultures with Escherichia coli (45 %), Enterococcus (37. 5 %), and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (30 %) being the most common bacterial genera isolated. R. equi was not identified in any of the samples. The correlation between isolated bacterial agents and the presence of respiratory infection was not statistically significant. The microorganisms found in the samples may be naturally present in the soil, feces, and environment in which the animals live, presenting a risk of opportunistic respiratory infection...|$|R
50|$|As of October 2002, {{there had}} been only 60 {{documented}} cases of <b>mules</b> birthing <b>foals</b> since 1527. In China in 2001, a mare mule produced a filly. In Morocco in early 2002 and Colorado in 2007, mare mules produced colts. Blood and hair samples from the Colorado birth verified that the mother was indeed a <b>mule</b> and the <b>foal</b> was indeed her offspring.|$|R
50|$|In young <b>mules</b> and <b>foals,</b> anal {{prolapse}} {{occurs with}} a frequency {{similar to that}} of Gasterophilus haemorrhoidalis. In extensive breeding conditions, the disease is only recognized after some days, leading to intense edema of prolapsed tissues and necrosis of the mucous membrane.|$|R

50|$|Blood {{transfusion}} {{is indicated}} if PCV drops below 12%,. The mare's blood {{may be used}} for transfusion if the red blood cells are washed multiple times to remove the serum component containing antibodies. If the mare can not be used, an alternative donor that is Aa and Qa negative may be used. This donor profile is most commonly seen in Quarter Horses, Morgans, and Standardbreds and is less likely in Thoroughbreds and Arabians, but ideally the donor should be blood typed prior to use rather than using breed as the sole method of identification. In <b>mule</b> <b>foals,</b> female donors that have been previously bred to a jack should not be used. Transfusion usually consists of 2-4 L of blood, or 1-2 L of packed cells, over the course of 2-4 hours. Blood transfusion is not without risks: these cells stress the mononuclear phagocytic system, increasing the foal's risk of infection, and also may lead to future transfusion reactions, so transfusion should only occur if required to save the animal's life. In the rare case where a suitable donor is not available or hemoglobin levels drop below 5 mg/dl, polymerized bovine hemoglobin may be given. PCV declines 4-7 days after initial transfusion. Dexamethasone is also sometimes used, but can affect blood glucose regulation of the patient.|$|R
6000|$|Examples of {{this class}} of myth in Indo-Aryan {{literature}} are not hard to find. Why is dawn red? Why are donkeys slow? Why have mules no young ones? <b>Mules</b> have no <b>foals</b> because they were severely burned when Agni (fire) drove them in a chariot race. Dawn is red, not because (as in Australia) she wears a red kangaroo cloak, but because she competed in this race with red cows for her coursers. Donkeys are slow because they never recovered from their exertions in the same race, when the Asvins called on their asses and landed themselves the winners.(1) And cows are accommodated with horns for a reason no less probable and satisfactory.(2) ...|$|R
