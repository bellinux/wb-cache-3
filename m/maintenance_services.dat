In this paper, we study a simple <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> contract involving a single agent (providing the <b>maintenance</b> <b>service)</b> and a single customer (owner of the equipment and recipient of the <b>maintenance</b> <b>service).</b> We develop a simple model to obtain the optimal strategies for both the customer and the agent.

40|$|AbstractMaintenance {{service is}} the most {{important}} part in industrial product-service system (iPSS). To enhance the proactiveness of <b>maintenance</b> <b>service,</b> the failure time of product need to be predicted. This study provides insight into how the maintenance time can be predicted accurately for the service decision-making of IPSS based on the historical failure time data, avoiding the dependence on mechanical condition monitoring. An improved grey prediction model is introduced to obtain a predictive interval of <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> time which is used as basis for making a decision of proactive <b>maintenance</b> <b>service.</b> The method is applied in an instance of <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> for agricultural machinery. In three examples of different types of agricultural machinery, the predicted intervals of maintenance time are given and the fitted values have high accordance with the real ones. The result shows that this approach can be used effectively to predict production failure time. Moreover, the output results of this approach can provide the necessary support to make a decision for proactive <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> without the dependence on mechanical condition monitoring in a reliable way...|$|R

40|$|Maintenance is {{the main}} part of product {{lifecycle}} management (PLM). Thus, the solution suitable for equipment maintenance can be easily extended to other industry equipment maintenance processes. While most of the current <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> management only rely on empirical experience, ignoring the dynamic information uncertainties and lacking flexible reactions hinder the effectiveness of the maintenance task assignment. Moreover, without a systematic and dynamic consideration of various related parameters, more limitations are exposed to current approaches. As such, it is of great importance to automate the maintenance process, consider all related parameters and cope with the dynamic uncertainties to endow equipment maintenance processes with smart and fast reaction capability, flexibility, and robustness. Among the first to address this problem, {{with the help of the}} Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud technologies, this thesis systematically proposes the real-time Cloud-enabled equipment <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> (CEMS). These new technologies can enable real-time equipment status data collection, advanced and proactive response maintenance as well as improved process visibility. By using the proposed CEMS, it results in a significant improvement in processing the equipment fault report, making a quick response, and dynamically assigning the maintenance tasks, enhancing the task management ability of the maintenance center. To achieve the overall aim of this research, three typical scenarios are examined as follows: Scenario Ⅰ: In this scenario, an overview of equipment <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> is studied and analyzed. Equipment <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> process is an important part of after-sales service, this study has taken a broad view at <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> and the corresponding research issues emerging in this field. ScenarioⅡ: In this scenario, a cloud-enabled platform for EMS assignment and control is developed, inspired by an industrial case of lift after-sales <b>maintenance</b> <b>service.</b> The presented cloud-based equipment <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> (CEMS) platform integrates various methods and techniques into a suite of applications for EMS assignment and control management, including intelligent inspection, equipment fault information processing, maintenance assignment and <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> execution control. Through the cloud computing and IoT technologies, a real-time <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> assignment and execution control platform is established. Heterogeneous physical equipment and manpower can be easily traced, tracked, and managed. Scenario Ⅲ: This scenario considers a <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> area where the <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> department operator needs to designate different kinds of maintenance task to corresponding <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> staff/agent. As the volume of maintenance demand increases quickly, the quality, efficiency, and robustness of such task assignment process require comprehensive study and analysis. Therefore, the major challenges of this work are how to the assign the maintenance task to the most suitable maintenance team. We propose an efficient assignment mechanism to minimize the total maintenance cost by dynamically assigning each task with most appropriate maintenance team. In this dissertation, the cloud enables and real-time advanced receiving, assignment and control problems in equipment maintenance are investigated and related maintenance assign task mechanisms and platform technologies are developed as well. This study of equipment <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> shall be of great value not only to researchers who desire to extend their research into this new area but also to practitioners who are interested in equipment fault prognosis by using the real-time equipment operation information. published_or_final_versionIndustrial and Manufacturing Systems EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|<b>Maintenance</b> <b>service</b> {{outsourcing}} is {{a strategic}} driver for asset intensive industries pursuing {{the enhancement of}} supply chain performance. <b>Maintenance</b> <b>service</b> supplier selection plays a relevant role in this premise since its significant impact on equipment availability, and hence, on business success. To periodically review suppliers' performances and update the outsourcing contract, a discrete stress-strength interference (DSSI) theory-based dynamic supplier selection model is presented for <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> outsourcing process. Taken account {{of the influence of}} randomness and uncertainty, a novel and universal evaluation criterion, demand fulfillment level (DFL) is introduced based on the DSSI theory. DFL is relevant to two random variables, which are random user's service order quantity (stress) and random supplier's service fulfillment quantity (strength), and DFL is defined as the probability that the latter (strength) is larger than the former (stress). Based on DFL, the proposed model can help users outsource the corresponding <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> to the most suitable supplier (maximum supplier reliability) at different periods. The decision rule can be described as a dynamic 3 -D diagram, according to which decision makers can periodically review suppliers' performances and update the outsourcing contract. A case study on <b>maintenance</b> <b>service</b> supplier selection problem for a steel company illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed model. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
