5|$|Lloyd {{negotiated}} with Curb {{to distribute the}} group's fifth and final album on Forward Records. Released in 1970, Markley insisted the album, originally self-titled, should be released under the name Markley, A Group. The album benefited from the full involvement and production experience of Lloyd, who sang {{the majority of the}} lead vocals, provided keyboards, and organized the orchestral arrangements. Danny Harris was a key influence on the album, writing half of its tracks. However, although the album is generally considered an improvement over Where's <b>My</b> <b>Daddy?,</b> the group could no longer cope with Markley's erratic behavior, and disbanded soon after the album's release.|$|E

25|$|However, Post {{left the}} studio due {{internal}} {{conflicts with the}} Paramount staff. His replacement was Shamus Culhane, {{a veteran of the}} Fleischer Studios. Culhane completed a few films that Post started and then ignored the rule book and made films that were very different from the previous regime. In 1966, the studio subcontracted The Mighty Thor cartoons from Grantray-Lawrence Animation, producers of the animated television series The Marvel Super Heroes. In 1967, Culhane directed another short based upon children's art, <b>My</b> <b>Daddy,</b> the Astronaut, which became Paramount's first film to be shown at an animation festival. However, when Paramount's board of directors rejected a proposal to produce episodes for a second Grantray-Lawrence series, Spider-Man, Culhane quit the studio, and was succeeded by former Terrytoons animator Ralph Bakshi in mid-1967. Although Bakshi quickly put several experimental shorts into production, by the fall of 1967, Paramount's new owners, Gulf+Western, had begun the process of shutting down the animation studio, a task completed in December. The last cartoon from Paramount Cartoon Studios, Mouse Trek, the finale of the Fractured Fables series, premiered on December 31, 1967.|$|E
500|$|... "Daddy" [...] is {{a nearly}} five-minute long R song. The first verse {{of the song}} begins with Beyoncé reminiscing about the times she and her father/manager, Mathew Knowles shared {{as a child and}} through her adolescence. She sings about wanting to be with a man and a child who has similar qualities as her father. This is {{illustrated}} in the lyrics: [...] "I treasure every irreplaceable memory and that's why I want my unborn son to be like <b>my</b> <b>daddy,</b> I want my husband to be like <b>my</b> <b>daddy,</b> there is no one else like my daddy." [...] According to Marc Anthony Neal of the PopMatters, Beyoncé also confidently embraces her womanhood in the song. In a way, Beyoncé pays tribute to her father through this song.|$|E
500|$|Late in 1968, Jimmy Bowen {{established}} his label Amos Records and signed the group the following year. While the band {{worked on the}} Where's <b>My</b> <b>Daddy?</b> album, Danny Harris rejoined and Lloyd returned to provide backing vocals and co-write [...] "Where's My Daddy?", [...] "Where Money Rules Everything", and [...] "Coming of Age in L.A." [...] with Markley. It became apparent on the album, however, that the echoing vocal harmonies found on the band's preceding works were replaced by a closely-miked sound. The album loosely possessed the components of a concept piece, narrated {{through the eyes of}} a young homeless girl named [...] "Poor Patty" [...] as she journeys through the chaos of post-Summer of Love Los Angeles. However, Where's <b>My</b> <b>Daddy?,</b> as well as its accompanying single [...] "Free as Bird", failed to reverse the WCPAEB's commercial fortunes, and it is regarded by critics and fans as the group's most lackluster album release.|$|E

500|$|The band debuted {{with the}} album Volume One in 1966 {{on the small}} FiFo record label. In {{the early years of}} the group, much was made of the WCPAEB's {{elaborate}} psychedelic light shows, which became the focal point of their live performances in Los Angeles. Following the release of Volume One, the WCPAEB signed with Reprise Records, recording three albums with the company, including arguably their most accomplished work [...] in 1968. Two additional albums, Where's <b>My</b> <b>Daddy?</b> and Markley, A Group, were distributed on independent labels before the group disbanded in 1970.|$|E
500|$|In May 1967, {{the band}} {{recorded}} and released their first album for Reprise, Part One. By the time recording sessions began, Markley had assumed absolute {{control of the}} WCPAEB's publishing rights, which explains his unusual selection for the A-side of the album's singles: a [...] "spoken rap" [...] composition [...] "1906", co-penned with session musician Ron Morgan, and a cover of the Mothers of Invention's song [...] "Help, I'm a Rock". The album itself featured songs that exhibited a wide-ranging stylistic variety, including Byrds-esque folk rock, garage rock, and Baroque pop. The song [...] "I Won't Hurt You" [...] {{was one of two}} compositions (the other being [...] "If You Want This Love") from the group's debut album re-recorded for Part One, where it was given a much more suddued atmosphere and a heartbeat rhythm. Shaun Harris sang the reworked version of [...] "I Won't Hurt You", rather than Lloyd, who, aside from some backing vocals on the album, would not sing lead on a WCPAEB release until the 1969 album Where's <b>My</b> <b>Daddy?.</b>|$|E

Stewart wrote [...] "Butterfly Fly Away" [...] after an argument with Travis (Till) and her dad breaking off his relationship for her. In the story, [...] "The Climb" [...] began {{when she was in the}} hen house writing. Travis (Till) told her that the song didn't represent who she is or how she feels. Later in a concert, she performs it live revealing the entire song with its new lyrics. Then, in the episode [...] "He Could Be the One" [...] Miley wrote a song called [...] "I'm Just Having Fun".
