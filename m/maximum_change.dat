25|$|The {{electrodes}} are {{immersed in}} the solution to be titrated and the potential difference between the electrodes is measured. Measured volumes of titrant are added, with thorough (magnetic) stirring, and the corresponding values of emf (electromotive force) or pH recorded. Small increments in volume should be added near the equivalence point which is found graphically by noting the burette reading corresponding to the <b>maximum</b> <b>change</b> of emf or pH per unit change of volume. When {{the slope of the}} curve is more gradual it is not always easy to locate the equivalent point by this method. However, if small increments (0.1nbsp&cm³ or less) of titrant are added near the end point of the titration and a curve of change of emf or pH per unit volume against volume of titrant is plotted, a differential curve is obtained in which the equivalence point is indicated by a peak.|$|E

The 2009 study identified nine {{planetary boundaries}} and, drawing on current scientific understanding, the researchers proposed quantifications for seven of them. These seven are climate change (CO2 concentration in the atmosphere < 350 ppm and/or a <b>maximum</b> <b>change</b> of +1 W/m2 in radiative forcing); ocean acidification (mean surface seawater saturation state with respect to aragonite ≥ 80% of pre-industrial levels); stratospheric ozone (less than 5% reduction in total atmospheric O3 from a pre-industrial level of 290 Dobson Units); biogeochemical nitrogen (N) cycle (limit industrial and agricultural fixation of N2 to 35 Tg N/yr) and phosphorus (P) cycle (annual P inflow to oceans not to exceed 10 times the natural background weathering of P); global freshwater use (< 4000nbsp&km3/yr of consumptive use of runoff resources); land system change (< 15% of the ice-free land surface under cropland); and the rate at which biological diversity is lost (annual rate of < 10 extinctions per million species). The two additional planetary boundaries for which the group had not yet been able to determine a boundary level are chemical pollution and atmospheric aerosol loading.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess normalized electromyography (EMG) of shoulder muscles during selected functional tasks of upper limb in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome. Methods: Test group consisted of 15 subjects with shoulder impingement syndrome selected by nonprobability convenient sampling and control group consisted of 15 matched healthy subjects. In each group selected exercises including open kinetic chain with and without external load and closed kinetic chain with axial load were done and during each exercise surface EMG from selected muscle was recorded. Results: There was significant difference between the two groups in the activities of upper trapezius, infraspinatus and three regions of deltoid muscle (P 2 E showed minimum changes and tripod showed <b>maximum</b> <b>changes</b> in muscle activity domain. Conclusion: Decrease in activity domain of infraspinatus and trapezius muscles in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome causes impairment of shoulder function.
