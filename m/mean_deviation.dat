2500|$|... "Dies Irae (Day of Wrath)" [...] {{is usually}} {{cited as the}} {{highlight}} of the album. According to Jeff Wagner in his book <b>Mean</b> <b>Deviation,</b> the song was a creative watershed in metal, and except for Mekong Delta, no other extreme metal band at the time had merged the genre with classical music so seamlessly. The orchestral section was conducted by Scott Laird. The song's first three minutes consist of orchestrated strings, synthesizer effects and the soprano vocals of Julianne Laird Hoge. After that the band joins in with its thrash metal output in contrast with the orchestration. Doug Mann executed the concept of the song and the band section was composed by Kurt Bachman. Dies irae itself is a Latin poem or hymn which prays mercy at the dawn of apocalypse. The poem was originally written by Thomas of Celano, an Italian friar of the Franciscans, who lived in 13th century and was an obligatory part of the Roman Catholic Requiem Mass for some centuries before 1969. Kurt Bachman stated that the song was inspired by Mozart's Requiem Mass.|$|E

The integration domain can be expressed in canonical form after a change of reference frame in the n-space, which is recognized as an infinitely thin n-cylindrical corona where the symmetry axis coincides with a coordinate axis.
