5|$|Air force experts raised {{questions}} and the <b>Malaysian</b> opposition leveled criticisms {{about the state of}} Malaysia's air force and radar capabilities. Many criticized the failure of the Royal <b>Malaysian</b> Air Force to identify and respond to an unidentified aircraft (later determined to be Flight 370) flying through <b>Malaysian</b> airspace. The <b>Malaysian</b> military became aware of the unidentified aircraft only after reviewing radar recordings several hours after the flight's disappearance. The failure to recognise and react to the unidentified aircraft was a security breach, and was also a missed opportunity to intercept Flight 370 and prevent the time-consuming and expensive search operation.|$|E
5|$|English {{remains an}} active second language, with its use allowed for some {{official}} purposes under the National Language Act of 1967. In Sarawak, English is an official state language alongside <b>Malaysian.</b> Historically, English was {{the de facto}} administrative language, with Malay becoming predominant after the 1969 race riots (13 May Incident). <b>Malaysian</b> English, also known as <b>Malaysian</b> Standard English, {{is a form of}} English derived from British English. <b>Malaysian</b> English is widely used in business, along with Manglish, which is a colloquial form of English with heavy Malay, Chinese, and Tamil influences. The government discourages the use of non-standard Malay but has no power to issue compounds or fines to those who use improper Malay on their advertisements.|$|E
40|$|<b>Malaysians</b> often mix the {{language}} between English and other borrowed language in their communication, {{for instance through}} Friendster. They also like using uncommon expression while they write a testimonial to their friends. Therefore, the writer is interested conducting a study of lexicalization used by <b>Malaysians</b> in giving testimonial in Friendster. Through this study, the writer wants to investigate the kinds of word formation process and Manglish features used by <b>Malaysians.</b> The main theory that the writer used is lexicalization by Traugott and Brinton, (2005). The approach {{of this study is}} qualitative descriptive. The writer collected twenty testimonials written by <b>Malaysians</b> in Friendster. Then, she analyzed the uncommon expressions unavailable in the dictionary. Furthermore, from the analysis, the writer found that <b>Malaysians</b> like using uncommon expressions while writing testimonials. In this case, the writer concludes that there are seven kinds of word formation used by <b>Malaysians.</b> Moreover, the new kind of word formation process found by the writer, was called addition. The writer also found fifteen particles belonging to Manglish features used by the <b>Malaysians.</b> Finally, the writer hopes that this thesis could be useful for the readers to know and understand deeply about lexicalization applied by <b>Malaysians</b> in giving testimonials in Friendster...|$|R
