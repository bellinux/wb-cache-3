5|$|In 1983, in {{recognition}} of his forthcoming 60th birthday, an article dedicated to <b>Moser</b> was published in Sydowia. The piece, compiled by Franz Schinner, C. Furrer-Siogas and Egon Horak, contained a detailed biography and a full bibliography of the 116 research publications <b>Moser</b> had authored or co-authored between 1949 and 1983. <b>Moser,</b> writing with Walter Jülich, published {{the first volume of}} the book series Farbatlas der Basidiomyzeten in 1985, presenting specimens of various Basidiomycota taxa. By the time of Moser's death, 19 volumes had been published; some subsequently published volumes have listed <b>Moser</b> as an author.|$|E
5|$|<b>Moser</b> {{was born}} on 13 March 1924 in Innsbruck, Austria, to parents Margaretha and Josef <b>Moser.</b> His father was a teacher at a {{technical}} college in the city, while his mother {{was the daughter of}} noted botanist Emil Johann Lambert Heinricher. <b>Moser</b> attended primary school and grammar school in the city, and showed an interest in natural sciences from a young age. His interest was cultivated by Heinricher, and Moser's earliest paintings of mushrooms date to 1935 when he was 11 years old.|$|E
5|$|<b>Moser</b> was {{promoted}} to Associate University Professor in 1964. Two years later, the Faculty of Science of the University of Innsbruck recommended that a chair of microbiology should be created at the Botanical Institute in Innsbruck. The Federal Ministry of Education accepted the recommendation. <b>Moser</b> was the only candidate for the position, and was unanimously named {{by a number of}} leading European botanists and mycologists for the post in 1967. Subsequently, in 1968, <b>Moser</b> {{was promoted}} to full professor, and, in 1972, <b>Moser</b> became the head of the newly established Institute of Microbiology, {{the first of its kind}} in Austria. He remained in charge of the Institute until his retirement. He taught on a wide range of subjects, including the taxonomy of fungi, ecology of fungi, mycogeography, bacteria, viruses, chemotaxonomy, molecular genetics, microbial toxicology, immunology and symbiosis. During his career at the university, he oversaw over 60 doctoral theses, in addition to a number of diploma theses. In 1970, <b>Moser</b> became the president of the Austrian Mycological Society, taking over after the death of the previous post-holder, Kurt Lohwag. Lohwag, in turn, had taken up the position after the death of his predecessor, Thirring, earlier that year. <b>Moser</b> remained the society's president for 21 years.|$|E

500|$|A {{comprehensive}} bibliography of <b>Moser's</b> work published with a 2003 obituary in Sydowia listed over 210 sole-authored or co-authored publications, with a further eight submitted or in print {{at time of}} publication. <b>Moser's</b> major works include: ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Mosers</b> took up {{residence}} in the Seri area on the Gulf of California in 1951. A major effort {{in the early years}} was to learn the Seri language well and understand the culture, but the <b>Mosers</b> also helped in various ways to deal with a measles epidemic and other medical and physical needs. Mary helped deliver more than thirty Seri babies during the years before Seri women began using the hospital in Hermosillo, the state capital. When the <b>Mosers</b> first arrived, the Seri population was about 230. During the time that the <b>Mosers</b> lived with the Seri people, the population of the Seri people reversed its downward trend and the total population began to increase.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} decades of his careers, <b>Moser</b> sought to clarify the taxonomic {{identity}} of European fungi by collecting specimens to be described as neotypes in the localities studied by Elias Magnus Fries, but this was no longer necessary after changes to nomenclatural rules that took effect in 1981. Among the Agaricales, Moser's interest was primarily in the complex genus Cortinarius. He published book-length works addressing Cortinarius taxa found in Europe and, co-writing with Horak, South America. <b>Moser,</b> working with Joe Ammirati, contributed to research on the genus in North America, and also examined Asian and Australasian taxa. He had a particular interest in Arctic–alpine habitats, and he documented, painted and published on his collections in these and other sites around the world. <b>Moser</b> initially doubted the usefulness of molecular phylogenetic analysis of the Agaricales, but later contributed to research in this area.|$|E

5|$|In 1942, <b>Moser</b> {{enrolled}} at the University of Innsbruck, taking classes in botany, zoology, geology, physics and chemistry. At this time, Austria was {{under the control of}} Nazi Germany and did not exist as an independent state. <b>Moser</b> became an authorised mushroom controller and instructor, and it was officially requested that he attend mycological seminars around Germany and Austria. At these seminars, he met a number of prominent mycologists, including Ernst Thirring. Thirring showed <b>Moser</b> some of the issues surrounding the large genus Cortinarius, which remained an interest {{for the rest of his}} life. In 1943, aged 19 and after only three terms at Innsbruck, his studies were interrupted so he could perform military service. Having shown earlier promise in languages, he was trained as an interpreter, then sent to the Balkan Peninsula. He continued to show an active interest in mycology, collecting and identifying mushrooms and reading Rolf Singer's Das System der Agaricales.|$|E

An old informant of Harry takes Debra to the woman's house, which Debra recognizes as the house of Brian <b>Moser.</b> <b>Moser</b> was the Ice Truck Killer, the main villain from the first season who was engaged to Debra, then tried to kill her. The informant reveals the woman's name was Laura <b>Moser</b> (Sage Kirkpatrick), and while researching her, Debra learns Laura was Dexter's mother, and that the Ice Truck Killer was Dexter's brother. The police discovered the real identity of Trinity, and at Arthur's house, Debra confronts Dexter, who feigns surprise and fears Debra is close to realizing his secret life as a serial killer. Instead, Debra says she believes the Ice Truck Killer used her to get to him, and she reasserts how much she loves her foster brother.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{retirement}} of Rocky Welton in 1999, former assistant coach Martin Segovia took over as the new head coach. In contrast to the 1990s, Garden City was unable to win a state championship throughout the 2000s, although the Buffaloes did produce three individual state titles and an All-American. Jason Nichols won individual state championships in 2000 and 2001 and sophomore Ryan Kromer won an individual state championship in 2002. In 2006, Beth Johnson was named a Second-Team All-American and in 2008, she was named as a First-Team All-American, the first girl {{to do so in}} school history. Also in 2008, Martin Segovia relinquished his role as head coach and former assistant Monte <b>Moser</b> took over as the new head coach. In 2010, the Buffaloes placed fourth in the state championship, while producing two individual state champions in Lane Greenlee and Joey Dozier. One year later, Anthony Calderon won an individual state championship. Following the 2012 season, Monte <b>Moser</b> retired and Carlos Prieto became the current head coach. In 2013, the Buffaloes won the state championship {{for the first time since}} 1999, and repeated in 2014, 2015 and 2016. Also in 2016, Michael Prieto won his fourth consecutive individual state title, the first 4-time individual state champion in school history and 33rd in state history.|$|E
5|$|From 1980 on, {{a better}} {{understanding}} of dinosaur biomechanics, and studies by palaeontologists Andreas Christian and Holger Preuschoft on the resistance to bending of the back of Plateosaurus, led to widespread acceptance of an erect, digitigrade limb posture and a roughly horizontal position of the back. Many researchers were of the opinion that Plateosaurus could use both quadrupedal gaits (for slow speeds) and bipedal gaits (for rapid locomotion), and Wellnhofer insisted that the tail curved strongly downward, making a bipedal posture impossible. However, <b>Moser</b> showed that the tail was in fact straight.|$|E
