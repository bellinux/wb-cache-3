Interleaving involved the placement of blotting papers within the text-block of a book and replacing them once they were fully soaked; a variety of papers were used, including <b>mimeograph</b> <b>paper</b> and green blotting paper (the latter of which ultimately caused more damage). In kilns, the humidity level was slowly lowered from ninety to forty percent. If deemed necessary, bindings were removed and dried separately.

Gay and lesbian publications like [...] "The Mirror", The Works and The Screamer, which {{is believed to be}} the city's earliest gay publication serve as examples.

The colon is an Ammons [...] "signature"; he uses it [...] "as an all-purpose punctuation mark."The colon permits him to stress the linkage between clauses and to postpone closure indefinitely....

5000|$|Life was not {{all work}} for the cadets. The first USO dance for enlisted men was held on March 4, 1943. The first formal social {{function}} for the cadets was a dance at Memorial Hall in Coffeyville. Also, a cadet club was opened in Coffeyville on West Eighth Street. A wives club was formed and involved itself in many projects, the most important being welfare and Red Cross activities. This included helping the wives settle among strange surroundings, visiting cadets in the hospital, and decorating the cadet recreational buildings. The club met weekly and published a small <b>mimeographed</b> <b>paper.</b> The city of Coffeyville allowed the cadets to use the high school swimming pool, and reserved it for their use during part of the day. In addition, there were USO shows from time to time, and dances attended by invited guests from Coffeyville and surrounding communities. The bowling alley was opened in May 1943 and had six lanes. The field had its own radio show that was arranged and written by the special service staff. Sometimes it broadcast from Coffeyville on station KGGF. Golf was also available at reduced rates at Coffeyville's Hillcrest Country Club. The post had a gymnasium and several athletic fields for softball, football, and volleyball. No base was complete without its obstacle course and Coffeyville was no exception.|$|R

40|$|Experiment I The {{impression}} {{values of}} 200 verbs were {{measured by a}} procedure {{similar to that of}} Dixon and Dixon (1964). Sixty-six male and 66 female college students served as subjects. From a list of association value of 523 verbs (Kashu, 1966), 200 verbs were {{selected on the basis of}} a pilot study. Out of 200, 60 verbs were estimated on a three-point rating scale, as good impression verbs, 80 as neutral impression verbs, and 60 as bad impression verbs. The subjects were instructed to imagine themselves using the verbs in sentences while talking to a friend. On the basis of this hypothetical situation, the 200 verbs were rated in terms of the kind of impression subject thought a friend would get of him when he used each verb in a sentence. The impression value was rated on a 7 -point scale ranging from very good impression (+ 3) to very bad impression (- 3). The results showed that (a) females judged the good and bad impression verbs as giving more extreme impression than males did, and that (b) the variances of ratings were larger for females than for males in case of the good and neutral verbs. The former result was consistent with the Dixons' study, but the latter was inconsitent. Experiment II Using good, neutral, and bad imprssion verbs of 30 in each, a contingency of verb and pronoun was examined under operant conditions in a Taffel-type verbal conditioning task modified for group administration. Eightysix female college students were handed a <b>mimeographed</b> <b>paper</b> on which 30 sets of three different kinds of verbs and a pronoun of I, YOU, or HE appeared, and they were instructed to select a verb which they thought they would like to use when they made a sentence containing the pronoun. The results indicated that the good impression verbs were selected more frequently than the other two, irrespective of the kind of pronuns. These results were inconsistent with the Dixon's results (1965). Further analysis of the data evidenced that the aeutral impression verbs had higher association values than good or bad impression verbs...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{preliminary}} researches, {{stem and}} branchwood of Paraserianthes falcataria L. Nielsen were suitable {{as raw material}} for pulp and paper manufacture. For the whole tree the highest proportion of bark was found in branches {{and the top of}} the tree with a value ranging 20 â€“ 35 %. Up to now, the pulp industries have spent money to remove bark of P. falcataria branch before pulping. The objective {{of this study was to}} know the suitability of branches including bark as raw material for pulp and paper manufacture. Samples were determined for fiber dimension and its derivation. Screened chips were cooked with the Kraft process. Liquor-to-wood-ratio was 4 : 1. Chemical charge was 13. 3 % NaOH and 6. 7 % Na 2 S. The temperature was raised from room temperature to 170 oC for 90 min and kept at this temperature for 90 min. Pulp was washed; then kappa number, screened and rejected pulp, residual of black liquor were determined. Research results showed that pulp branchwood with bark has the values of screened pulp yield, alkali consumption, and kappa number 46. 91 %; 9, 57; and 25. 63, respectively. It paper product has the values of breaking length, burst factor, stretch, tensile strength, and opacity 9. 94; 83. 80; 3. 57 %; 1, 733. 34; 6. 33 kN/m, and 92. 85 %, respectively.

40|$|In December 1976, a {{group of}} {{language}} educators gathered at the University of Cambridge to discuss an idea that was, at the time, largely unheard of {{in the field of}} language teaching and learning. The idea was 'autonomy' and the discussion that took place was preserved for posterity in a <b>mimeographed</b> collection of <b>papers</b> that has recently been made available once again on the Web (Harding-Esch 1977 a). Reading the collection for the first time, almost 30 years later, I was {{struck by the fact that}} the issues addressed by the contributors were very similar to those that we continue to discuss today. In particular, the editor noted in her preface that "there were heated arguments about the definition of autonomy on the one hand and its intrinsic value on the other" (Harding-Esch 1977 b: Iii). Although the context for discussion of autonomy in language learning has changed considerably, the questions of what exactly we mean by autonomy and how we see its value to the individual and society remain with us and are likely to do so for some time to come. It also occurred to me, however, that the contributors to the Cambridge collection could hardly have anticipated the explosion of interest in the idea of autonomy in language teaching and learning that we are now experiencing. The aim of this chapter, therefore, is to revisit the issue of what we understand by autonomy from the perspective of the difficulty that we seem to experience in agreeing upon a single definition of the term. What strategies do we have to 'make sense of' the concept of autonomy in the light of this difficulty and how are they related to the broader context of growing worldwide interest in autonomy in language learning? 14 page(s...|$|R
