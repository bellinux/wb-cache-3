Marlene was played by Pamela Reed, who would continue to make several guest appearances as the character. During the casting auditions, Seth Gordon interviewed Reed {{as if she were}} playing the character and Reed improvised a great deal, creating many personality elements that were eventually incorporated into Marlene Knope's character. Gordon said, [...] "Pamela was especially sort of nimble on her feet at inventing a character in the room on the fly, and I thought that was really impressive." [...] During the audition, Reed was asked whether she was proud of her daughter, and Reed replied, [...] "I want <b>my</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>to</b> be successful, which is why I always tell her, there's nothing wrong with being a wife and mother." [...] The improvised line, which was based on something her father-in-law said to her, so impressed the producers that they incorporated it into the episode. Schur said the producers sought to establish Leslie's mother early in the series, and he felt her relationship to Leslie {{was the center of the}} entire [...] "Canvassing" [...] episode. Schur said of Leslie's attempts to impress her mom at her public forum, [...] "We imagined it in the writer's room that she is eight years old and doing a piano recital, and she's nervous because her mom's there." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 15 November 2011 it was {{reported}} that Stevens had recorded a collection of songs about fruit and vegetables as a way of helping to encourage children to eat five portions of fruit and veg per day. The songs were for an album titled Tasty Tunes and were made available as free downloads from the website of children's food firm Ella's Kitchen. Stevens launched the songs with a one-off performance at a nursery in Streatham, south London. The songs include food-themed versions of [...] "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" [...] and [...] "The Hokey-Cokey", and Stevens said of the project; [...] "As a new mum, I'm always looking for exciting ways to encourage <b>my</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>to</b> try new foods, especially greens.

2500|$|The {{to in the}} infinitive construction, {{which is}} found {{throughout}} the Germanic languages, is originally a preposition before the dative of a verbal noun, but in the modern languages it {{is widely regarded as}} a particle which serves as a marker of the infinitive. In German, this marker (zu) sometimes precedes the infinitive, but is not regarded as part of it. In English, on the other hand, it is traditional to speak of the [...] "bare infinitive" [...] without to and the [...] "full infinitive" [...] with it, and to conceive of to as part of the full infinitive. (In the sentence [...] "I had my daughter clean her room", clean is a bare infinitive; in [...] "I told <b>my</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>to</b> clean her room", to clean is a full infinitive.) Possibly this is because the absence of an inflected infinitive form made it useful to include the particle in the citation form of the verb, and in some nominal constructions in which other Germanic languages would omit it (e.g. to know her is to love her). The concept of a two-word infinitive can reinforce an intuitive sense that the two words belong together. For instance, the rhetorician John Duncan Quackenbos said, [...] "To have is as much one thing, and as inseparable by modifiers, as the original form habban, or the Latin habere." [...] The usage writer John Opdycke based a similar argument on the closest French, German, and Latin translations.|$|E
