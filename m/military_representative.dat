5|$|As {{early as}} June 1961, General Maxwell D. Taylor, President John F. Kennedy's special <b>military</b> <b>representative,</b> had become {{interested}} in the prospect of erecting a physical barrier to halt the increasing infiltration of PAVN materiel (and later, manpower) through their Laotian logistical corridor and into the border regions of the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam). He then held talks with the Deputy Director of the Pentagon's Office of Special Operations, Edward G. Lansdale, who convinced him that a better solution to the infiltration dilemma would be the creation of mobile units to attack the infiltrators.|$|E
5|$|Each country's {{delegation}} {{includes a}} <b>Military</b> <b>Representative,</b> a senior officer from each country's armed forces, {{supported by the}} International Military Staff. Together the Military Representatives form the Military Committee, a body responsible for recommending to NATO's political authorities those measures considered necessary for the common defence of the NATO area. Its principal role is to provide direction and advice on military policy and strategy. It provides guidance on military matters to the NATO Strategic Commanders, whose representatives attend its meetings, and {{is responsible for the}} overall conduct of the military affairs of the Alliance under the authority of the Council. The Chairman of the NATO Military Committee is Petr Pavel of the Czech Republic, since 2015.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, as World War I was ending, the Royal Air Force {{built an}} {{airfield}} for two planes, and in November the Ottomans retreated from Zor Sanjak without a fight. The Syrian Emirate's army entered Deir ez-Zor on 4 December, and Zor Sanjak {{became part of}} Syria. In 1919, as the British and French argued over {{the borders of the}} planned mandates, the British permanent <b>military</b> <b>representative</b> to the Supreme War Council Henry Wilson suggested adding Palmyra to the British mandate. However, the British general Edmund Allenby persuaded his government to abandon this plan. Syria (including Palmyra) became part of the French Mandate after Syria's defeat in the Battle of Maysalun on 24 July 1920.|$|E

5|$|The Germans {{captured}} twenty-two LT vz. 34s - {{plus the}} prototype, when they occupied Czechoslovakia, {{but there is}} no record of their use so they were presumably quickly scrapped. Ten LT vz. 34s were captured after they were abandoned by the insurgents during the Slovak National Uprising in 1944. They were shipped to Škoda Works for repairs, but the local <b>military</b> <b>representative</b> ordered them scrapped because of their poor condition and obsolescence. The Waffen-SS tried to overturn this order as it planned to transfer them to Nazi puppet state of Croatia. Two were saved from the scrapyard, but by March 1945 the others had their turrets salvaged to be rearmed with two machine guns and mounted in fixed fortifications.|$|E
5|$|Sturdee {{embarked}} for Australia on 16 November 1918, and his AIF {{appointment was}} terminated on 14 March 1919. He {{was entitled to}} his AIF rank of lieutenant colonel as an honorary rank, but his substantive rank was still only that of a captain. He was given the brevet rank of lieutenant colonel on 1 January 1920, but this did not become substantive until 1 April 1932. Sturdee initially served as Senior Engineer Officer {{on the staff of}} the 3rd Military District at Victoria Barracks, Melbourne. In 1921, he attended the Staff College at Quetta in British India. He was an instructor in military engineering and surveying at the Royal Military College, Duntroon from 16 February to 31 December 1924, before returning to Melbourne to serve {{on the staff of the}} 4th Division until 26 March 1929. Posted to the United Kingdom, he served at the War Office and attended the Imperial Defence College in 1931.

After Plumer's return from Italy Rawlinson spent a period as British Permanent <b>Military</b> <b>Representative</b> at the Supreme War Council at Versailles, but at the start of April he took over the remnants of Gough's Fifth Army after its recent defeat. It was renamed the Fourth Army.|$|E
25|$|Derby got the Prime Minister {{to agree}} that Robertson should {{accompany}} Wilson (British <b>Military</b> <b>Representative)</b> to all Supreme War Council meetings and he would make no proposals until Robertson and the War Council had {{had a chance to}} vet them. He then reneged on this promise, telling Derby (26 November) that Robertson would have a chance to comment at the meeting itself and that decisions would have to ratified by the War Cabinet after they had been made. Lloyd George restored Wilson's freedom of action by instructing Wilson to send his reports directly to him.|$|E
25|$|A {{small number}} of Australian Army liaison {{officers}} were stationed in the UK throughout the war. These officers were based at the High Commission of Australia in London. This was a continuation of pre-war arrangements, which included an Australian <b>military</b> <b>representative</b> to the British War Office and the Imperial General Staff. Lieutenant General Edward Smart appointed {{the head of the}} Australian Military Mission to the UK from October 1942.

25|$|As {{advised by}} Wilson and Viscount French, Lloyd George persuaded the War Cabinet and the French {{to agree to}} a Supreme War Council. Hankey (20 October) {{suspected}} that the plan of an inter-allied staff of generals in Paris would alone be enough to drive Robertson to resignation. Wilson was appointed British Permanent <b>Military</b> <b>Representative</b> after it had been offered to Robertson (which would have meant giving up his CIGS job). Robertson later claimed in his memoirs that he supported the SWC as a political body, but not the military advisers providing separate advice from the national general staffs.|$|E
25|$|In December 1944, {{following}} the death of Field Marshal Sir John Dill, Wilson was relieved as Supreme Commander, promoted to field marshal on 29 December 1944, and sent to Washington to be Chief of the British Joint Staff Mission, a post he took up in January 1945. One of Wilson's most secret duties was as the British <b>military</b> <b>representative</b> on the Combined Policy Committee which dealt with the development, production and testing of the atom bomb. Wilson continued to serve as head of the British Joint Staff Mission until 1947, to the satisfaction of Britain and the United States. President Truman awarded him the Distinguished Service Medal in November 1945.|$|E
25|$|After leaving Carrier Division Five, Davis was the Deputy U.S. <b>Military</b> <b>Representative</b> to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Military Staff Committee.

He served as Deputy United States Representative to the Standing Group, North Atlantic Treaty Organization until 16 August 1953. On 1 November 1953, Davis became Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs and the U.S. Navys Director of Foreign Military Affairs, positions he held {{until his retirement}} from active duty in April 1955.

25|$|As Sub Chief of Staff to the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), Wilson was Sir John French's most {{important}} advisor during the 1914 campaign, but his poor relations with Haig and Robertson saw him sidelined from top decision-making {{in the middle}} years of the war. He {{played an important role}} in Anglo-French military relations in 1915 and – after his only experience of field command as a corps commander in 1916 – again as an ally of the controversial General Nivelle in early 1917. Later in 1917 he was informal military advisor to the British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, and then British Permanent <b>Military</b> <b>Representative</b> at the Supreme War Council at Versailles.|$|E
25|$|Lloyd George now {{prepared}} for a showdown with Robertson, who was still unhappy over the handing over of British divisions to General Reserve. He proposed that the CIGS be reduced to his pre-1915 powers (i.e. reporting to the Secretary of State for War, not direct to the Cabinet) and that the British <b>military</b> <b>representative</b> at the Supreme War Council in Versailles be Deputy CIGS {{and a member of}} the Army Council (i.e. empowered to issue orders to Haig). He offered Robertson a choice of remaining as CIGS with reduced powers or else accepting demotion to Deputy CIGS at Versailles – either way, Lloyd George would now have been able to cut him out of the decision-making loop.|$|E
25|$|With the {{establishment}} of the Independent State of Croatia on 10 April 1941 Navratil was brought back into active service. He was named as a <b>military</b> <b>representative</b> in Bucharest. He served as minister of the armed forces from 2 September 1943 to 29 January 1944. After he was relieved of his post, reportedly due to complaints about the brutality of the government, he traveled to Vienna, where his family was located and remained there until the end of World War II. In 1945 he moved to Zell am See, where he lived until he was located by American troops in 1946. He was extradited to communist Yugoslavia in December 1946. In Zagreb he was sentenced to death on charge of war crimes, and executed on 7 June 1947.|$|E
