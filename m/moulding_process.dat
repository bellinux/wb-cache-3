5|$|The {{industry}} expanded {{rapidly in}} the 1940s because World WarII created a huge demand for inexpensive, mass-produced products. In 1946, American inventor James Watson Hendry built the first screw injection machine, which allowed much more precise control over the speed of injection {{and the quality of}} articles produced. This machine also allowed material to be mixed before injection, so that coloured or recycled plastic could be added to virgin material and mixed thoroughly before being injected. Today, screw injection machines account {{for the vast majority of}} all injection machines. In the 1970s, Hendry went on to develop the first gas-assisted injection <b>moulding</b> <b>process,</b> which permitted the production of complex, hollow articles that cooled quickly. This greatly improved design flexibility as well as the strength and finish of manufactured parts while reducing production time, cost, weight and waste.|$|E

25|$|Around 1990 a new {{construction}} technique was invented: in-mould micro shell. A very thin shell was incorporated during the <b>moulding</b> <b>process.</b> This rapidly became the dominant technology, allowing for larger vents {{and more complex}} shapes than hard shells.|$|E
25|$|Before 1949, {{chemical}} engineer Fritz Stastny (1908–1985) developed pre-expanded PS beads by incorporating aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as pentane. These beads are {{the raw material}} for moulding parts or extruding sheets. BASF and Stastny applied for a patent that was issued in 1949. The <b>moulding</b> <b>process</b> was demonstrated at the Kunststoff Messe 1952 in Düsseldorf. Products were named Styropor.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, the Italian art {{historian}} Anna Maria Carruba and the Etruscologist Adriano La Regina contested the traditional dating {{of the wolf}} {{on the basis of}} an analysis of the casting technique. Carruba had been given the task of restoring the sculpture in 1997, enabling her to examine how it had been made. She observed that the statue had been cast in a single piece using a variation of the lost-wax casting technique that was not used in ancient times; ancient Greek and Roman bronzes were typically constructed from multiple pieces, a method that facilitated high quality castings with less risk than would be involved in casting the entire sculpture at once. Single-piece casting was, however, widely used in medieval times to mould bronze items that needed a high level of rigidity, such as bells and cannon. Carruba argues, like Braun, that the damage to the wolf's paw had resulted from an error in the <b>moulding</b> <b>process.</b> In addition, La Regina, who is the state superintendent of Rome's cultural heritage, argues that the sculpture's artistic style is more akin to Carolingian and Romanesque art than that of the ancient world.|$|E

500|$|Two-shot or {{multi-shot}} moulds {{are designed}} to [...] "overmould" [...] within a single moulding cycle and must be processed on specialised injection moulding machines with two or more injection units. This process is actually an injection <b>moulding</b> <b>process</b> performed twice and therefore has a much smaller margin of error. In the first step, the base colour material is moulded into a basic shape, which contains spaces for the second shot. Then the second material, a different colour, is injection-moulded into those spaces. Pushbuttons and keys, for instance, made by this process have markings that cannot wear off, and remain legible with heavy use.|$|E
500|$|Traditionally, the {{injection}} {{portion of the}} <b>moulding</b> <b>process</b> was done at one constant pressure to fill and pack the cavity. This method, however, allowed for a large variation in dimensions from cycle-to-cycle. More commonly used now is scientific or decoupled moulding, a method pioneered by RJG Inc. In this {{the injection}} of the plastic is [...] "decoupled" [...] into stages to allow better control of part dimensions and more cycle-to-cycle (commonly called shot-to-shot in the industry) consistency. First the cavity is filled to approximately 98% full using velocity (speed) control. Although the pressure should be sufficient {{to allow for the}} desired speed, pressure limitations during this stage are undesirable. Once the cavity is 98% full, the machine switches from velocity control to pressure control, where the cavity is [...] "packed out" [...] at a constant pressure, where sufficient velocity to reach desired pressures is required. This allows part dimensions to be controlled to within thousandths of an inch or better.|$|E
2500|$|The black rubber of {{the puck}} {{is made up}} of a mix of natural rubber, antioxidants, bonding {{materials}} and other chemicals to achieve a balance of hardness and resilience. This mixture is then turned in a machine with metal rollers, where workers add extra natural rubber, and ensure that the mixing is even. Samples are then put into a machine that analyses if the rubber will harden at the right temperature. An automated apparatus, called a pultrusion machine, extrudes the rubber into long circular logs that are [...] in diameter and then cut into [...] thick pieces while still soft. These pre-forms are then manually put into moulds that are the exact size of a finished puck. There are up to 200 mould cavities per moulding palette, capable of producing up to 5,000 pucks per week. The moulds are then compressed. This compression may be done cold or with the moulds heated to [...] for 18 minutes, depending on the proprietary methods of the manufacturer. They come out hard and then are allowed to sit for 24 hours. Each puck is manually cleaned with a trimmer machine to remove excess rubber. The <b>moulding</b> <b>process</b> adds a diamond cross-hatch texture {{around the edge of the}} puck for more friction between the stick and puck for better control and puck handling.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: For the {{purposes}} of producing precise products and providing the flexibility for products variation, an open-loop control commercial injection moulding machine is retrofitted into a closed-loop control system for monitoring the filling and post-filling phases of the injection processes. The hydraulic control unit, control and interface circuits, safety limit switches and personal-computer-based controller were redesigned and constructed. Since the injection <b>moulding</b> <b>processes</b> have compli-cated non-linear dynamics and model uncertainty, {{the application of a}} classical proportional–integral– derivative controller has adaptivity and robustness problems, especially with regards to the pressure control during compression phase. Here, an intelligent fuzzy controller is employed to adjust the injection speed of the filling phase and to control the nozzle pressure of the post-filling phase. The experimental results show that this controller has good performance in actual injection <b>moulding</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R
