40|$|International audienceA {{pilot study}} of the {{possibility}} to investigate temperature-dependent neutron scattering from fiber-DNA in solution is presented. The study aims to establish the feasibility of experiments to probe the influence of spatial confinement on the structural correlation {{and the formation of}} denatured bubbles in DNA during the melting transition. Calorimetry and neutron scattering experiments on fiber samples immersed in solutions of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) prove that the melting transition occurs in these samples, that the transition is reversible to some degree, and that the transition is broader in temperature than <b>for</b> <b>humidified</b> fiber samples. The PEG solutions apply an osmotic pressure that maintains the fiber orientation, establishing the feasibility of future scattering experiments to study the melting transition in these sample...|$|R

30|$|In {{this study}} the {{applicability}} of thermochemical heat storage (THS) under Northern Cyprus climate conditions is theoretically investigated. An underground THS system, integrated with 8  m 2 solar air collectors placed {{on the roof of}} a flat roof, detached building is considered. In addition, an evaporative humidification unit <b>for</b> <b>humidifying</b> the air during the discharging process is assumed. It was found that 8  m 3 of absorbent was required to meet the mismatch between solar energy supply and building heat load where the total solar heat gain and heat load are 1939 kWh and 3253 kWh respectively. On the other hand with 8  m 2 of solar air collectors, 35  days in the summer period (May/June) where the solar irradiation is in the range of 6 [*]→[*] 7 kWh/m 2 are required to regenerate the absorbent.|$|R
