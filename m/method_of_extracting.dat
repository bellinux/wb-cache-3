5|$|Sir Michael Francis Addison Woodruff, FRS, FRCS (3 April 1911– 10 March 2001) was an English {{surgeon and}} {{scientist}} principally remembered for his research into organ transplantation. Though born in London, Woodruff spent his youth in Australia, where he earned degrees {{in electrical engineering}} and medicine. Having completed his studies shortly after the outbreak of World War II, he joined the Australian Army Medical Corps, but was soon captured by Japanese forces and imprisoned in the Changi Prison Camp. While there, he devised an ingenious <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>extracting</b> nutrients from agricultural wastes to prevent malnutrition among his fellow POWs.|$|E
5|$|On {{top of all}} {{the misery}} the Zoroastrians had to pay a heavy {{religious}} tax known as Jizya. Zoroastrian sources record the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>extracting</b> this as designed to humiliate the dhimmi, the taxed person, who was compelled to stand while the officer receiving the money sat on a high throne. Upon receiving the payment, the officer gave the dhimmi a blow on the neck and drove him roughly away. The public was invited to watch the spectacle. Arab tax collectors would mock Zoroastrians for wearing Kushti and would rip it off, hanging the cord around the necks of the beleaguered faithful. Due to corruption of the tax officials, at times twice and even three times the official figure would be collected, because every intermediary had to receive his share. If the families could not afford paying the Jizya, their children were beaten and even tortured and their religious books were thrown in fire. That is how the term “the bookless” came about. Under the woeful conditions, some had to convert and {{there were those who}} declared themselves Muslims, picked up Islamic names, but in secret continued Zoroastrian practices. Today the latter group among the Zoroastrians is known as Jaddid. In response to persecution and segregation policies, the Zoroastrians community became closed, introverted, and static.|$|E

500|$|Once {{maturation}} is confirmed, one {{of three}} procedures is used to extract the eggs from a female paddlefish. [...] The three procedures are (1) the traditional hand-stripping method, considered to be time consuming and laborious; (2) Caesarean section, a relatively quick surgical <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>extracting</b> eggs through a [...] abdominal incision; considered faster than hand stripping, suturing can be time consuming and the incision may result in muscular stress and poor suture retention which lowers survival rate; and (3) MIST, (minimally invasive surgical technique) which is the fastest of the three procedures because it requires less handling of the fish and {{eliminates the need for}} suturing. [...] A small internal incision is made in the dorsal area of the oviduct, which allows direct stripping of eggs from the body cavity through the gonopore bypassing the oviductal funnels.|$|E
2500|$|Since Great Canadian Oil Sands (now Suncor) started {{operation}} of its mine in 1967, bitumen has been extracted {{on a commercial}} scale from the Athabasca Oil Sands by surface mining. In the Athabasca sands there are very large amounts of bitumen covered by little overburden, making surface mining the most efficient <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>extracting</b> it. The overburden consists of water-laden muskeg (peat bog) over top of clay and barren sand. The oil sands themselves are typically [...] deep, {{sitting on top of}} flat limestone rock. Originally, the sands were mined with draglines and bucket-wheel excavators and moved to the processing plants by conveyor belts.|$|E

2500|$|One <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>extracting</b> uranium from {{seawater}} {{is using}} a uranium-specific nonwoven fabric as an adsorbent. The total amount of uranium recovered from three collection boxes containing 350kg of fabric was >1kg of yellowcake after 240days of submersion in the ocean. According to the OECD, uranium may be extracted from seawater using this method for about $300/kg-U. The experiment by Seko etal. was repeated by Tamada et al. in 2006. They found that the cost varied from ¥15,000 to ¥88,000 depending on assumptions and [...] "The lowest cost attainable now is ¥25,000 with 4g-U/kg-adsorbent used in the sea area of Okinawa, with 18repetitionuses." [...] With the May, 2008 exchange rate, this was about $240/kg-U.|$|E
2500|$|The {{condenser}} microphone, invented at Western Electric in 1916 by E. C. Wente, is {{also called}} a capacitor microphone or electrostatic microphone—capacitors were historically called condensers. Here, the diaphragm acts as one plate of a capacitor, and the vibrations produce {{changes in the}} distance between the plates. There are two types, depending on the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>extracting</b> the audio signal from the transducer: DC-biased microphones, and radio frequency (RF) or high frequency (HF) condenser microphones. With a DC-biased microphone, the plates are biased with a fixed charge (Q). The voltage maintained across the capacitor plates changes with the vibrations in the air, according to the capacitance equation (C = [...] ), where Q = charge in coulombs, C = capacitance in farads and V = potential difference in volts. [...] The capacitance of the plates is inversely proportional to {{the distance between the}}m for a parallel-plate capacitor. The assembly of fixed and movable plates is called an [...] "element" [...] or [...] "capsule".|$|E
2500|$|Dow {{was founded}} in 1897 by chemist Herbert Henry Dow, who invented a new <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>extracting</b> the bromine that was trapped {{underground}} in brine at Midland, Michigan. Dow originally sold only bleach and potassium bromide, achieving a bleach output of 72 tons a day in 1902. [...] Early in the company's history, a group of British manufacturers tried to drive Dow out of the bleach business by cutting prices. [...] Dow survived by also cutting its prices and, although losing about $90,000 in income, began to diversify its product line. [...] In 1905, German bromide producers began dumping bromides at low cost in the U.S. {{in an effort to}} prevent Dow from expanding its sales of bromides in Europe. [...] Instead of competing directly for market share with the German producers, Dow bought the cheap German-made bromides and shipped them back to Europe. This undercut his German competitors. [...] Even in its early history, Dow set a tradition of rapidly diversifying its product line. Within twenty years, Dow had become a major producer of agricultural chemicals, elemental chlorine, phenol and other dyestuffs, and magnesium metal.|$|E
