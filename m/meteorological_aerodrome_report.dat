40|$|Water and ice {{detection}} over {{road and}} runway surfaces {{is important to}} improve traffic safety and to reduce maintenance costs. An innovative low cost capacitive sensor was developed to estimate the dry, wet, or icy state of surfaces. The reliability and repeatability of the indications of the sensor were investigated in a previous work based on simulations and experiments in laboratory, together with a preliminary short test in the field. This work {{is devoted to the}} study of the indications of 4 sensors (standard or bituminized) during continuous data acquisition in the field (at the Turin Airport) lasted 8 months. The indications of different sensors were highly correlated. As one important problem when measuring in the field is due to dirt and salt spread over the road, a preliminary study on the effect of different salt concentrations in the water covering the surface of the sensor was performed. Both simulations and laboratory tests showed that the sensor is not affected by the presence of salt in the water. Considering data measured in the field, the estimated condition of the road provided by the sensors was found to be consistent with the METAR (<b>METeorological</b> <b>Aerodrome</b> <b>Report)</b> message of the Turin Airport, for the whole period of investigation. Correlation was found between data from the sensors and rain, fog, and snowfall. The beginning formation of ice identified by the sensor was found to be in some agreement with the indication of a mathematical model of ice prediction from meteorological data. The possibility of using the indications of the sensor together with weather data to train an algorithm providing a more precise prediction of ice formation is discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDust {{storms that}} develop along the Pisco-Ica desert in Southern Peru, locally known as “Paracas” winds have ecological, health and {{economic}} repercussions. Here we identify dust sources through MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) imagery and analyze HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single Particles Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) model trajectories and dispersion patterns, along with concomitant synoptic-scale meteorological conditions from National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis (NCEP/NCAR). Additionally, surface pressure {{data from the}} hourly <b>METeorological</b> <b>Aerodrome</b> <b>Report</b> (METAR) at Arica (18. 5 °S, 70. 3 °W) and Pisco (13. 7 °S, 76. 2 °W) were used to calculate Alongshore (sea-level) Pressure Gradient (APG) anomalies during Paracas dust storms, their duration and associated wind-speeds and wind directions. This study provides a review on the occurrence and strength of the Paracas dust storms {{as reported in the}} Pisco airfield for five-year period and their correspondence with MODIS true-color imagery in terms of dust-emission source areas. Our results show that most of the particle fluxes moving into the Ica-Pisco desert area during Paracas wind events originate over the coastal zone, where strong winds forced by steep APGs develop as the axis of a deep mid-troposphere trough sets in along north-central Chile. Direct relationships between Paracas wind intensity, number of active dust-emission sources and APGs are also documented, although the scarcity of simultaneous METAR/MODIS data for clearly observed MODIS dust plumes prevents any significant statistical inference. Synoptic-scale meteorological composites from NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data show that Paracas wind events (steep APGs) are mostly associated with the strengthening of anticyclonic conditions in northern Chile, that can be attributed to cold air advection associated with the incoming trough. Compared to the MODIS images, HYSPLIT outputs were able to spatially reproduce trajectories and dust dispersion plumes during the Paracas wind storms. HYSPLIT trajectories revealed that part of the wind-eroded lithological material can be transported downwind several kilometers along the Peruvian coast and also deposited over the nearby coastal ocean, giving support to the presence of an aeolian signal in continental shelf sediments, of great importance for paleoenvironmental studies...|$|E

Meteorological Applications, 22 (4), pp. 779 - 788., which has been published in final form at [URL] This article {{may be used for}} non-commercial purposes in accordance with Wiley Terms and Conditions for Self-Archiving. Automated classification of cloud types using a ground-based infrared imager can provide invaluable high resolution and localised information for Air Traffic Controllers. Observations can be made consistently, continuously in real time and accurately during both day and night operation. Details of a field trial of an automated, ground-based infrared cloud classification system are presented. The system was designed at Campbell Scientific ltd in collaboration with Loughborough University, UK. The main objective of the trial was to assess the performance of an automated infrared camera system with a lightning detector in classifying several types of clouds, specifically Cumulonimbus and Towering Cumulus, during continuous day and night operation. Results from the classification system were compared with those obtained from <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Aerodrome</b> <b>Reports</b> (METAR) and with data generated by the UK Meteorological Office from their radar and sferics automated cloud reports system. In comparisons with METAR data, a Probability of Detection of up to 82 % was achieved, together with a minimum Probability of False Detection of 18 %...|$|R
40|$|We have {{conducted}} {{a study on the}} development of detailed climatological probabilities of violating cloud related Lightning Launch Commit Criteria (LLCC) used by Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and Kennedy Space Center (CCAFS and KSC). This study was conducted to provide the 45 th Weather Squadron with improved capabilities for operational forecasting for launches from CCAFS and KSC. Our focus was on developing methods to produce climatological probabilities of violating one of the LLCC, the thick cloud layer rule. We developed a hybrid process of blending data from the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), <b>meteorological</b> <b>aerodrome</b> <b>reports</b> (METARs), radiosonde observations (RAOBs), and expert meteorologist data sets to create a merged data set for determining the probability of violating the thick cloud layer rule. Using our blended hybrid process, we computed cloud thicknesses, and probabilities of violating the thick cloud LLCC for each day of the year at 00 Z and 12 Z. Additionally, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to identify the potential for modifying the thick cloud LLCC. A primary result from our study is a sub-daily data set of the climatological probabilities of violating the thick cloud layer rule. We conducted eight validation case studies that demonstrated our calculated violations match well with observed violations. The development of a merged data set that provides more useful information than any one of the individual data sets is a technique that is likely to be useful in solving many other climatological problemsCaptain, United States Air Forc...|$|R

He appeared to have limited empathy for his opponents, most of whom did not survive his attacks. On 24 January, after claiming his 43rd air victory, he remarked: This D.F.W crew deserved to die, because they had no notion whatever of how to defend themselves, which showed that during their training they must have been slack, and lazy, and probably liked going to Berlin too often instead of sticking to their training and learning {{as much as they could}} while they had the opportunity.
