5|$|According to Diodorus, Philip {{marched on}} his enemies in this {{alliance}} {{before they had}} chance to combine, and forced them to ally to Macedon instead. However, other sources suggest that the picture was actually <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>complex,</b> and that Philip in turn defeated each of the powers {{over the next few}} years, with the exception of Athens.|$|E
5|$|More recent models {{attempt to}} model bubble dynamics, also usually by {{simplified}} models, {{to facilitate the}} computation of tables, and later to allow real time predictions during a dive. Models that approximate bubble dynamics are varied. They range from {{those that are not}} <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> than the dissolved phase models, to those that require considerably greater computational power.|$|E

40|$|In most applications, {{practitioners}} {{are interested in}} locating global optima. In such applications, local optima that result from some opti-mization algorithms are an unnecessary side effect. In other words, in such applications, locating global optima is a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> computationally <b>complex</b> problem than locating local optima. In several practical appli-cations, however, local optima themselves are of interest. Somewhat sur-prisingly, {{it turned out that}} in many such applications, locating all local optima is a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> computationally <b>complex</b> problem than locating all global optima. In this paper, we provide a theoretical explanation for this surprising empirical phenomenon. 1 Formulation of the Problem A usual understanding is that global optimization is harder. There are many optimization techniques, starting with the simple gradient descent. A usual problem with these techniques is that when they converge, they ofte...|$|R

The ability to navigate and orient themselves during migration is a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> phenomenon that may include both endogenous programs as well as learning.|$|E
5|$|The {{identification}} of stolen diamonds presents {{a set of}} difficult problems. Rough diamonds will have a distinctive shape depending on whether their source is a mine or from an alluvial environment such as a beach or river - alluvial diamonds have smoother surfaces than {{those that have been}} mined.

5|$|Inspired by the Evil Queen in Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Lady Tremaine in Disney's Cinderella (1950), Gothel was {{developed}} by directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard into a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> villain than the fairy tale witch upon whom she is based because the character is forced to rely solely on her wit, charisma and intelligence as opposed to sorcery in order to survive. The film's most difficult character to develop, Gothel's exotic appearance, whose beauty, dark curly hair and voluptuous figure were deliberately drawn {{to serve as a}} foil to Rapunzel's, was inspired by both Murphy and American singer Cher.|$|E
50|$|The Mercury launch escape system (LES) used on Redstone and Atlas {{launches}} was identical, but the ASIS system varied considerably {{between the}} two boosters as Atlas was a <b>much</b> larger, <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> vehicle with five engines, two of which were jettisoned during flight, a more sophisticated guidance system, and inflated balloon tanks that required constant pressure to not collapse.|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, TIW was {{considered}} {{to be part of the}} role known as tactical reconnaissance or tac recce. As traditional tasking and reporting has evolved to provide a <b>much</b> broader, <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> and often <b>more</b> dynamic set of questions to—and range of products from—TIW, the term Combat-aircraft ISTAR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target-Acquisition and Reconnaissance) much better describes the role of TIW and the aircraft that collect the imagery.|$|R
5|$|Following Asilomar, new genetic {{engineering}} techniques and applications developed rapidly. DNA sequencing methods improved greatly (pioneered by Frederick Sanger and Walter Gilbert), as did oligonucleotide synthesis and transfection techniques. Researchers learned {{to control the}} expression of transgenes, and were soon racing—in both academic and industrial contexts—to create organisms capable of expressing human genes {{for the production of}} human hormones. However, this was a more daunting task than molecular biologists had expected; developments between 1977 and 1980 showed that, due to the phenomena of split genes and splicing, higher organisms had a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> system of gene expression than the bacteria models of earlier studies. The first such race, for synthesizing human insulin, was won by Genentech. This {{marked the beginning of the}} biotech boom (and with it, the era of gene patents), with an unprecedented level of overlap between biology, industry, and law.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, he {{identified}} the hieroglyphic script on the Rosetta stone as being {{written in a}} mixture of ideograms and phonetic signs, just as Young had argued for Demotic. He reasoned that if the script was entirely ideographic the hieroglyphic text would require as many separate signs as there were separate words in the Greek text. But there were in fact fewer, suggesting that the script mixed ideographic and phonetic signs. This realization finally made it possible for him to detach himself from the idea that the different scripts had to be either fully ideographic or fully phonetic, and he recognized it as being <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> mixture of sign types. This realization gave him a distinct advantage.|$|E
5|$|Throughout a {{great and}} open area, not only {{will there be a}} greater chance of {{favourable}} variations, arising from the large number of individuals of the same species there supported, but the conditions of life are <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> from the large number of already existing species; and if some of these species become modified and improved, others will have to be improved in a corresponding degree, or they will be exterminated. Each new form, also, as soon as it has been improved, will be able to spread over the open and continuous area, and will thus come into competition with many other forms... the new forms produced on large areas, which have already been victorious over many competitors, will be those that will spread most widely, and will give rise to the greatest number of new varieties and species. They will thus play a more important role in the changing history of the organic world.|$|E

5|$|For {{symbolic}} memorials, numerous {{designs were}} possible, from simple monuments through to <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> pieces of sculpture. Obelisks {{had been a}} popular memorial form in the 19th century and remained so in the inter-war years, including in Britain, France, Australia and Romania. One factor in this popularity was that obelisks were relatively cheap to build, while they also fitted well with the existing civic architecture in many towns. Memorial plaques were another popular memorial style around the world. Soldiers, either individually or in groups, were a popular sculptural feature in most countries, portrayed in various stances; typically these were allegorical, although in France {{the style of the}} soldier could also carry political meaning and reflect local political sympathies. Although the trend pre-dated the First World War, very few Western war memorials portrayed heroic commanding officers, as had been popular earlier in the 19th century; if soldiers were depicted, they were invariably ordinary soldiers, usually infantrymen. After the unveiling of the Cenotaph in London, it became a popular design in many other locations in Britain and Australia too.|$|E
5|$|Since Deep Blue's {{victory over}} Garry Kasparov in chess in 1997, IBM {{had been on}} the hunt for a new challenge. In 2004, IBM Research manager Charles Lickel, over dinner with coworkers, noticed that the {{restaurant}} they were in had fallen silent. He soon discovered the cause of this evening hiatus: Ken Jennings, who was then {{in the middle of his}} successful 74-game run on Jeopardy!. Nearly the entire restaurant had piled toward the televisions, mid-meal, to watch the phenomenon. Intrigued by the quiz show as a possible challenge for IBM, Lickel passed the idea on, and in 2005, IBM Research executive Paul Horn backed Lickel up, pushing for someone in his department to take up the challenge of playing Jeopardy! with an IBM system. Though he initially had trouble finding any research staff willing to take on what looked to be a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> challenge than the wordless game of chess, eventually David Ferrucci took him up on the offer. In competitions managed by the United States government, Watson's predecessor, a system named Piquant, was usually able to respond correctly to only about 35% of clues and often required several minutes to respond. To compete successfully on Jeopardy!, Watson would need to respond in no more than a few seconds, and at that time, the problems posed by the game show were deemed to be impossible to solve.|$|E
5|$|The Factory No. 174 {{produced}} {{its last}} T-26 tanks in February 1941. After that, the factory began retooling {{to produce the}} new and <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> T-50 light tank. This work was slowed by delays {{in the delivery of}} new equipment and series production of the T-50 did not begin on schedule (planned for 1 June 1941). As a result, factory management decided to resume the production of the T-26, using T-26 hulls, turrets, and other parts already in stock. About 47 T-26 tanks were assembled and 77 were repaired in July–August 1941 before the factory was relocated from Leningrad to Chelyabinsk in the end of August 1941, and then to Chkalov in September 1941. The Factory No. 174 produced engines and spare parts for the T-26, installed additional armour plates on some T-26s, replaced flame-throwers with 45mm tank guns in turrets of 130 KhT-133 flame-throwing tanks, repaired tanks in army units (846 T-26s since the beginning of 1941) and mounted about 75 turrets from the T-26 and the T-50 as bunkers for the defence of Leningrad.|$|E
