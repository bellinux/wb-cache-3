Synchytrium anemones can cause harm to anemone and thalictrum flowers. Synchytrium aureum infects many agricultural and horticultural plants. Synchytrium vaccinii creates galls on cranberry, azalea, chamaedaphne, gaultheira, and ledum. Synchytrium fragariae infects strawberry plants. Synchytrium trichosanthidis parasitizes an Indian curcubit, and S. sesamicola is responsible for losses in Indian crops of sesame (Sesamum indicum). [...] Synchytrium psophocarpi {{is one of the}} major diseases affecting winged bean (Psophocarpus tetragonolobus), which is important high protein crop. Synchytrium pogostemonis is the casual agent of budok (which translates as wart in a local Indonesian language), a disease of Patchouli (Pogostemon cablin). Synchytrium solstitiale parasitizes the yellow <b>star</b> <b>thistle</b> (Centaurea solstitialis), an important weed in the United States. For this reason, S. solstitiale is being considered as a biological control of the yellow <b>star</b> <b>thistle</b> in the United States.

30|$|Many {{non-native}} invasive {{plants are}} adapted to fire. Plant invasions into wildland ecosystem present a particularly vexing problem for fire managers. Fire often exacerbates plant invasions {{that can lead}} to changes in fire regimes. Examples include the invasion of cheat grass (Bromus tectorum) in the Great Basin, melaleuca (Melaleuca quinquenervia) in the Everglades, spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa) in the Rocky Mountains, and yellow <b>star</b> <b>thistle</b> (Centaurea solstitialis) in California. On the other hand, fire can also be an important tool for managing plant invasions. Managers of wildland fire use programs should consider the potential interactions of invasive plants with fuels, fire behavior, and fire regimes to ensure that their fire management goals and objectives can be met in the presence of these non-native plants. At the very least, land managers should monitor for invasive plants following fires and take mitigating measures as appropriate.|$|R

5|$|Yosemite National Park has {{documented}} more than 130 non-native plant species within park boundaries. These non-native plants were introduced into Yosemite following {{the migration of}} early Euro-American settlers in the late 1850s. Natural and human-caused disturbances, such as wildland fires and construction activities, have contributed to a rapid increase in the spread of non-native plants. A number of these species aggressively invade and displace the native plant communities, resulting in impacts on the park's resources. Non-native plants can bring about significant changes in park ecosystems by altering the native plant communities and the processes that support them. Some non-native species may cause {{an increase in the}} fire frequency of an area or increase the available nitrogen in the soil that may allow more non-native plants to become established. Many non-native species, such as yellow <b>star</b> <b>thistle</b> (Centaurea solstitialis), are able to produce a long tap root that allows them to out-compete the native plants for available water.|$|R
40|$|Conservation {{easements}} are {{an increasingly}} popular strategy for conserving biological diversity on private land. Long-term vegetation monitoring on conservation easements can provide critical information on persistence {{of biological diversity}} and abundance of invasive species.

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{indigenous}} and exotic plants found in North American affect {{the nervous system}} of animals, some being associated with considerable economic losses to the livestock industry. Arguably the most important group of plants affecting the nervous system are those belonging to the genera Astragalus and Oxytropis, collectively known as locoweeds. These plants, found in vast areas of western North America and {{in many parts of}} the world, have long been recognized as a problem to livestock [1, 2]. There are numerous other plants affecting the nervous system such as yellow <b>star</b> <b>thistle</b> (Centaurea solstitialis) and Russian knapweed (Acroptilon repens) that will be discussed in the second section of this chapter. These and a variety of other plants are significant not only because they are poisonous and cause neurological disease in animals, but they also aggressively displace indigenous plants and reduce the value of natural ranges for grazing. Others like white snakeroot (Eupatorium rugosum) have historical and contemporary significance because of their effects on the nervous system. For example, deaths of early settlers in eastern North America who drank the milk from cows with " milk sickness", a fatal disease characterized by severe muscle tremors, is attributed to the toxin in white snakeroot.

40|$|Woodland {{restoration}} sites {{planted with}} Quercus lobata (valley oak) often have serious invasions of nonnative annual grasses and thistles. Although prescribed fire can effectively control these exotics, restoration managers {{may be reluctant}} to use fire if it causes substantial mortality of recently planted saplings. We studied the effects of prescribed fires on the survival and subsequent growth of 5 - and 6 -year-old valley oak saplings at a research field near Davis, California. One set of blocks was burned in summer 2003 at a time that would control yellow <b>star</b> <b>thistle,</b> a second set of blocks was burned in spring 2004 at a time that would control annual grasses, and a third set was left unburned. Very few oaks {{died as a result of}} either fire (3 – 4 %). Although a large proportion was top-killed (66 – 72 %), virtually all these were coppiced and most saplings over 300 cm tall escaped top-kill. Tree height, fire temperature, and understory biomass were all predictive of the severity of sapling response to fire. Although the mean sapling height was initially reduced by the fires, the growth rates of burned saplings significantly exceeded the growth rates of unburned control trees for 2 years following the fires. By 2 – 3 years after the fires, the mean height of spring- and summer-burned saplings was similar to that of the unburned control saplings. The presence of valley oak saplings does not appear to preclude the use of a single prescribed burn to control understory invasives, particularly if saplings are over 300 cm tall...|$|R

Billions {{of dollars are}} spent annually on efforts to control invasive species in agricultural and natural settings. Studies have revealed multiple benefits from removing invasives. However, {{there have been no}} studies that have evaluated the outcomes of these strategies in fuels-reduction areas, at least not in southern California. I investigated efforts to control three invasive plant species (Carduus pycnocephalus Italian thistle, Centaurea solstitialis yellow <b>star</b> <b>thistle,</b> and Foeniculum vulgare sweet fennel) at three sites in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. In all three cases, weed control efforts initially reduced the cover of invasive species targeted for eradication. Native cover was evaluated at one site, but it showed no differences in any year following treatment. Following eradication of Italian thistle in a fuels-reduction area, I planted disturbance-adapted native plants belonging to three life-history strategies (annuals, herbaceous perennials, and perennial grasses). I evaluated the ability of these natives to resist re-establishment of the invasive thistle. Unfortunately, this experiment was done during a drought. As replacement vegetation, perennial grass and herbaceous perennial cover was low and native annuals did not recruit. Italian thistle showed little difference in cover regardless of which native plant life-history strategy it occurred with. However, several months following planting, thistle grown with perennial grasses were smaller than thistle grown in plots that had been designated to receive annual plants (annuals that never grew). Although perennial grasses did not reduce the cover of thistle, they did reduce its size. Further research on the use of native species to prevent re-establishment of invasive species may help guide resource management strategies in fuels-reduction areas...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of plant species to future atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations [CO 2] has been deter-mined {{for hundreds of}} crop and tree species. However, no data are currently available regarding the {{response of}} invasive weedy species to past or future atmospheric [CO 2]. In the current study, the growth of six species which are widely recognized as among the most invasive weeds in the continental United States, Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop.), ®eld bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis L.), leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L.), perennial sowthis-tle (Sonchus arvensis L.), spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa Lam.), and yellow <b>star</b> <b>thistle</b> (Centaurea solstitialis L.) were grown from seed at either 284, 380 or 719 mmol mol± 1 [CO 2] until the onset of sexual reproduction (i. e. the vegetative per-iod). The CO 2 concentrations corresponded roughly to the CO 2 concentrations which existed at the begin-ning of the 20 th century, the current [CO 2], and the future [CO 2] projected {{for the end of}} the 21 st century, respectively. The average stimulation of plant bio-mass among invasive species from current to future [CO 2] averaged 46 %, with the largest response (+ 72 %) observed for Canada thistle. However, the growth response among these species to the recent [CO 2] increase during the 20 th century was signi®-cantly higher, averaging 110 %, with Canada thistle again (+ 180 %) showing the largest response. Overall, the CO 2 -induced stimulation of growth for these spe-cies during the 20 th century (285 ± 382 mmol mol± 1) was about 33 greater than for any species examined previously. Although additional data are needed, the current study suggests the possibility that recent increases in atmospheric CO 2 during the 20 th century may have been a factor in the selection of these species.
