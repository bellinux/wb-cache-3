Although the field makes abundant use of randomized and controlled experiments in laboratory settings, such research can only assess a limited range of short-term phenomena. Thus, psychologists also rely on creative statistical methods to glean knowledge from clinical trials and population data. These include the Pearson product–moment correlation coefficient, the analysis of variance, <b>multiple</b> <b>linear</b> <b>regression,</b> logistic regression, structural equation modeling, and hierarchical linear modeling.

2500|$|In statistics, linear {{regression}} is a linear approach for modeling {{the relationship between}} a scalar dependent variable y and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables) denoted X. The case of one explanatory variable is called simple {{linear regression}}.

2500|$|The very {{simplest}} case of {{a single}} scalar predictor variable x and a single scalar response variable y is known as simple linear regression. [...] The extension to multiple and/or vector-valued predictor variables (denoted with a capital X) is known as <b>multiple</b> <b>linear</b> <b>regression,</b> also known as multivariable linear regression. [...] Nearly all real-world regression models involve multiple predictors, and basic descriptions of linear regression are often phrased {{in terms of the}} multiple regression model. [...] Note, however, that in these cases the response variable y is still a scalar. Another term multivariate linear regression refers to cases where y is a vector, i.e., the same as general linear regression.|$|E

Methods under consideration are <b>multiple</b> <b>linear</b> <b>regressions</b> (MLR), {{support vector machine}} with polynomial kernel (SVM-POL), and support vector machine with Radial Basis Function kernel (SVM-RBF). Large-scale data are from Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL). Five predictor variables are chosen: (1) temperature, (2) pressure, (3) precipitation, (4) evaporator, and (5) net short wave. Accuracy is assessed by 10 -fold cross-validation in terms of root-mean-squared error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient (R). SVM-RBF is the most accurate model. Prediction accuracy of monthly average rainfall and temperature is satisfying in most part of the country. Lastly, downscaling models can project long term trends of monthly average rainfall and temperature.

Due to the existing drawback of fuzzy C-means (FCM) RBF which is time consuming, we used symmetry-based Fuzzy C-means (SFCM) to improve the effectiveness of RBF.
