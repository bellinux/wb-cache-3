5|$|After {{putting on}} the crown, Finn becomes {{corrupted}} by its power, going mad. He attacks the Destiny Gang—who his family owed a debt as established in the previous episode—and put out the fires that they started, but his uncontrolled power causes the <b>mutagenic</b> bomb that Simon stopped to explode, destroying the surrounding area. Jake, however, falls into a <b>mutagenic</b> puddle and is mutated into a creature similar to the Lich, which attacks Finn.|$|E
5|$|Paxillus involutus also {{contains}} agents which appear to damage chromosomes; {{it is unclear}} whether these have carcinogenic or <b>mutagenic</b> potential. Two compounds that have been identified are the phenols involutone and involutin; the latter is responsible for the brownish discolouration upon bruising.|$|E
5|$|Trivalent {{chromium}} {{occurs in}} trace amounts in foods, wine and water. In contrast, hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI) or Cr6+) is highly toxic and <b>mutagenic</b> when inhaled. Ingestion of chromium(VI) in {{water has been}} linked to stomach tumors, and it may also cause allergic contact dermatitis (ACD).|$|E
5|$|Around this time, Space Pirates {{set up a}} base on Aether after {{detecting}} the <b>mutagenic</b> substance Phazon on the planet. A Galactic Federation Marine Corps patrol ship encounters one of the Pirates' supply ships leaving the planet and an altercation follows. Both ships suffer heavy damage, and after the Federation loses contact with the Marines, it calls the bounty hunter Samus Aran to investigate.|$|E
5|$|In the Lego toyline Bionicle series, the Visorak horde is {{a species}} {{consisting}} of six spider-like breeds. They {{are created by}} the Brotherhood of Makuta to conquer islands; they possess <b>mutagenic</b> venom and spin sticky green webs. In the Transformers franchise, Tarantulas and Blackarachnia are both Predacons that turn into giant spiders. Blackarachnia, being part biological, has venom that paralyzes other Transformers and she is capable of spinning webs.|$|E
5|$|Mutations in germ-line DNA (i.e., DNA of {{the sperm}} or egg, which {{manifest}} in the offspring). These occur spontaneously, or are triggered by environmental radiation or <b>mutagenic</b> chemicals. A recently discovered mechanism, {{which is likely to}} be more important than the others combined, is infections with viruses, which integrate their DNA into their hosts. Organisms do not want to mutate: mutation just happens. Most of the mutations are harmful or lethal to the offspring, but a very small minority turn out to be advantageous, as novel proteins get produced that serve new functions.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen {{fixation}} {{plays an}} important role in the nitrogen cycle. Azotobacter also synthesizes some biologically active substances, including some phytohormones such as auxins, thereby stimulating plant growth. They also facilitate the mobility of heavy metals in the soil, thus enhancing bioremediation of soil from heavy metals, such as cadmium, mercury and lead. Some kinds of Azotobacter can also biodegrade chlorine-containing aromatic compounds, such as 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, which was previously used as an insecticide, fungicide, and herbicide, but later was found to have <b>mutagenic</b> and carcinogenic effects.|$|E
5|$|Other {{metabolites}} {{isolated from}} different species include dibenzonaphtyridinone alkaloids, prenylated phenols, benzofurans, chromenes, natural rubber (polyisoprene), sterols, and the sugar alcohol volemitol. Among toxic substances, Lactarius turpis contains the <b>mutagenic</b> alkaloid necatorin, {{and the small}} compound cycloprop-2-ene carboxylic acid {{has been identified as}} the toxic agent in Russula subnigricans. Some secondary metabolites showed antibiotic properties in laboratory tests. An ethanolic extract of Russula delica was antibacterial, and a lectin from Russula rosea showed antitumor activity.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species have}} a hot to very acrid taste {{and can cause}} {{gastrointestinal}} symptoms. Despite this, such species are eaten in some regions, e.g. Lactarius torminosus in Finland or Russia. Often, they are parboiled or pickled to make them palatable, and sometimes, they are used as spice, for example Russula emetica in Eastern Europe. Some species are however truly poisonous: the East Asian and North American Russula subnigricans causes rhabdomyolysis and is potentially lethal, and Lactarius turpis from Eurasia contains a <b>mutagenic</b> substance.|$|E
5|$|Cancers can {{be induced}} in animals at many sites. At {{sufficiently}} high doses TCDD has caused cancer in all animals tested. The most sensitive is liver cancer in female rats, {{and this has}} long been a basis for risk assessment. Dose-response of TCDD in causing cancer {{does not seem to be}} linear, and there is a threshold below which it seems to cause no cancer. TCDD is not <b>mutagenic</b> or genotoxic, in other words, it is not able to initiate cancer, and the cancer risk is based on promotion of cancer initiated by other compounds or on indirect effects such as disturbing defense mechanisms of the body e.g. by preventing apoptosis or programmed death of altered cells. Carcinogenicity is associated with tissue damage, and it is often viewed now as secondary to tissue damage.|$|E
5|$|In Resident Evil: Revelations (2012), set in 2005, Valentine is sent on {{a rescue}} mission to save Redfield from a bioterrorist group. Redfield is {{believed}} to be held on a luxury cruise ship in the Mediterranean Sea, but once Valentine and her new partner, Parker Luciani, are aboard, the rescue operation is revealed to be a trap. The ship is infested with a new breed of leech-like zombies. Meanwhile, Redfield and his new partner, Jessica Sherawat, {{make their way to the}} ship to find Valentine. Together, they slowly unravel a global conspiracy involving an earlier outbreak of a <b>mutagenic</b> virus and a botched investigation by a rival agency.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Corruption is set {{six months after}} the events of , and follows bounty hunter Samus Aran as she assists the Galactic Federation in its fight against the Space Pirates. While fending off a Space Pirate assault, Samus and her fellow bounty hunters are {{attacked}} by her doppelgänger, Dark Samus, who incapacitates them with a <b>mutagenic</b> material called Phazon. After losing contact with the other hunters, the Federation sends Samus on a mission to determine what happened to them. During the course of the game, Samus works to prevent the Phazon from spreading from planet to planet while being slowly corrupted by the Phazon herself.|$|E
5|$|While the <b>mutagenic</b> and {{genotoxic}} {{effects of}} TCDD are sometimes disputed and sometimes confirmed it does foster {{the development of}} cancer. Its main action in causing cancer is cancer promotion; it promotes the carcinogenicity initiated by other compounds. Very high doses may, in addition, cause cancer indirectly; one of the proposed mechanisms is oxidative stress and the subsequent oxygen damage to DNA. There are other explanations such as endocrine disruption or altered signal transduction. The endocrine disrupting activities seem {{to be dependent on}} life stage, being anti-estrogenic when estrogen is present (or in high concentration) in the body, and estrogenic in the absence of estrogen.|$|E
5|$|Depending {{on which}} {{character}} the player assumes control of, either Chris or Barry {{is separated from}} the rest of the team during the chase and does not make it to the mansion. At this point, the team decides to split up to investigate. Over the course of the game, the player character finds several members of Bravo Team, including Kenneth J. Sullivan being eaten by a zombie; Richard Aiken, who is either killed by a giant venomous snake or eaten by a shark; Forest Speyer, who is found dead on the balcony and then revived as a zombie; and Bravo Team leader Enrico Marini, who reveals that one of Alpha Team's members is a traitor before being shot and killed by an unseen assailant. Bravo Team survivor Rebecca Chambers joins Chris. The player character eventually learns that a series of illegal experiments was being undertaken by a clandestine research team under the authority and supervision of biomedical company Umbrella Corporation. The creatures roaming the mansion and its surrounding areas are the results of these experiments, which have exposed the mansion's personnel and various animals and insects to a highly contagious and <b>mutagenic</b> biological agent known as the T-virus.|$|E
5|$|Rebecca Lansing, a TriOptimum {{counter-terrorism}} consultant, contacts {{the player}} and claims that Citadel Station's mining laser is being powered up to attack Earth. SHODAN's {{plan is to}} destroy all major cities on the planet, {{in a bid to}} become a kind of god. Rebecca says that a certain crew member knows how to deactivate the laser, and promises to destroy the records of the hacker's incriminating exchange with Diego if the strike is stopped. With information gleaned from log discs, the hacker destroys the laser by firing it into Citadel Station's own shields. Foiled by the hacker's work, SHODAN prepares to seed Earth with a <b>mutagenic</b> virus—the same one responsible for turning the station's crew into mutants. The hacker, while attempting to jettison the chambers used to cultivate the virus, confronts and defeats Diego, who has been transformed into a powerful cyborg by SHODAN. Next, SHODAN begins an attempt to upload itself into Earth's computer networks. Following Rebecca's advice, the hacker prevents the download's completion by destroying the four antennas that SHODAN is using to send data.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil 5 (2009) {{is set in}} {{the fictional}} African town of Kijuju in 2009, where a {{biological}} agent has turned local residents into zombies. Valentine has been missing since a fight with her commander-turned-double agent Albert Wesker, years before the game's events. The fight is shown in the game's Lost in Nightmares downloadable content (DLC), in which Redfield and Valentine search for Umbrella's founder, Ozwell E. Spencer, inside a mansion {{on the edge of a}} cliff. Instead they find Wesker, who overpowers them. To save Redfield, Valentine tackles Wesker, and they both crash through a window and over the cliff. Their bodies are not recovered, and Valentine is declared dead. In fact she was injured by the fall and saved by Wesker, who then used her as a test subject in his experiments on <b>mutagenic</b> viruses.|$|E
5|$|Set in {{the year}} 2072, the protagonist—a nameless hacker—is caught while {{attempting}} to access files concerning Citadel Station, a space station owned by the TriOptimum Corporation. The hacker is taken to Citadel Station and brought before Edward Diego, a TriOptimum executive. Diego offers to drop all charges against the hacker {{in exchange for a}} confidential hacking of SHODAN, the artificial intelligence that controls the station. Diego secretly plans to steal an experimental <b>mutagenic</b> virus being tested on Citadel Station, and to sell it on the black market as a biological weapon. To entice cooperation, Diego promises the hacker a valuable military grade neural implant. After hacking SHODAN, removing the AI's ethical constraints, and handing control over to Diego, the protagonist undergoes surgery to implant the promised neural interface. Following the operation, the hacker is put into a six-month healing coma. The game begins as the protagonist awakens from his coma, and finds that SHODAN has commandeered the station. All robots aboard have been reprogrammed for hostility, and the crew have been either mutated, transformed into cyborgs, or killed.|$|E
25|$|Extraterrestrial solar {{ultraviolet}} radiation is <b>mutagenic,</b> induces strand {{breaks in the}} DNA and reduces survival substantially.|$|E
25|$|One DISC1 {{mouse model}} is {{induced by the}} <b>mutagenic</b> {{chemical}} ENU. ENU introduces missense point mutations; screening for mutations in a particular exon of DISC1 can produce mouse models with schizophrenia-like behavioural deficits.|$|E
25|$|The {{carcinogenity}} {{of tobacco}} smoke is not explained by nicotine per se, {{which is not}} carcinogenic or <b>mutagenic,</b> although it is a metabolic precursor for several compounds which are. In addition, it inhibits apoptosis, therefore accelerating existing cancers. Also, NNK, a nicotine derivative converted from nicotine, can be carcinogenic.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen {{abstraction}} {{from the}} 1’-deoxyribose carbon by the hydroxyl radical creates a 1 ‘-deoxyribosyl radical. The radical can then react with molecular oxygen, creating a peroxyl radical {{which can be}} reduced and dehydrated to yield a 2’-deoxyribonolactone and free base. A deoxyribonolactone is <b>mutagenic</b> and resistant to repair enzymes. Thus, an abasic site is created.|$|E
25|$|For many interactions, {{the binding}} site is known {{on one or}} more of the {{proteins}} to be docked. This is the case for antibodies and for competitive inhibitors. In other cases, a binding site may be strongly suggested by <b>mutagenic</b> or phylogenetic evidence. Configurations where the proteins interpenetrate severely may also be ruled out a priori.|$|E
25|$|Dydrogesterone {{has been}} {{prescribed}} {{and used in}} over 10million pregnancies worldwide. There have been no harmful effects exhibited due {{to the use of}} dydrogesterone while pregnant. Dydrogesterone is safe to use during pregnancy only when prescribed and indicated by a medical practitioner. Studies have not shown any incidence of decreased fertility due to dydrogesterone at therapeutic dose. The Ames test found no evidence of any potential <b>mutagenic</b> or toxicity properties.|$|E
25|$|The {{most deadly}} form of skin cancer, {{malignant}} melanoma, is mostly caused by DNA damage independent from UVA radiation. This {{can be seen}} from the absence of a direct UV signature mutation in 92% of all melanoma. Occasional overexposure and sunburn are probably greater risk factors for melanoma than long-term exposure. UVC is the highest-energy, most-dangerous type of ultraviolet radiation, and causes adverse effects that can variously be <b>mutagenic</b> or carcinogenic.|$|E
25|$|Small {{amounts of}} {{endogenous}} ethylene are also produced in mammals, including humans, due to lipid peroxidation. Some of endogenous ethylene is then oxidized to ethylene oxide, which {{is able to}} alkylate DNA and proteins, including hemoglobin (forming a specific adduct with its N-terminal valine, N-hydroxyethyl-valine). Endogenous ethylene oxide, just as like environmental (exogenous) one, can alkylate guanine in DNA, forming an adduct 7-(2-hydroxyethyl)-guanine, and this poses an intrinsic carcinogenic risk. It is also <b>mutagenic.</b>|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, class IB reductases are not {{inhibited}} by dATP {{because they}} lack approximately 50 N-terminal amino acids required for the allosteric activity site. Eukaryotic cells with class IA reductases have a mechanism of negative control to turn off synthesis of dNTPs as they accumulate. This mechanism protects the cell from toxic and <b>mutagenic</b> effects that can arise from the overproduction of dNTPs because changes in balanced dNTP pools lead to DNA damage and cell death.|$|E
25|$|Trigonelline (N-methyl-nicotinate) is a {{derivative}} of vitamin B6 {{that is not}} as bitter as caffeine. In green coffee beans, the content is between 0.6% and 1.0%. At a roasting temperature of , 85% of the trigonelline is degraded to nicotinic acid, leaving small amounts of the unchanged molecule in the roasted beans. In green coffee beans, trigonelline is synthesized from nicotinic acid (pyridinium-3-carboxylic acid) by methylation from methionine, a sulfur-containing amino acid. <b>Mutagenic</b> activity of trigonelline has been reported.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not clear}} how the cell determines the {{locations}} of de novo DNA methylation, but evidence suggests that, for many (though not all) locations, RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) is involved. In RdDM, specific RNA transcripts are produced from a genomic DNA template, and this RNA forms secondary structures called double-stranded RNA molecules. The double-stranded RNAs, through either the small interfering RNA (siRNA) or microRNA (miRNA) pathways direct de-novo DNA methylation of the original genomic location that produced the RNA. This sort of mechanism is thought to be important in cellular defense against RNA viruses and/or transposons, both of which often form a double-stranded RNA that can be <b>mutagenic</b> to the host genome. By methylating their genomic locations, through an as yet poorly understood mechanism, they are shut off and are no longer active in the cell, protecting the genome from their <b>mutagenic</b> effect. Recently, it was described that methylation of the DNA is the main determinant of embryogenic cultures formation from explants in woody plants and is regarded the main mechanism that explains the poor response of mature explants to somatic embryogenesis in the plants (Isah 2016).|$|E
25|$|In January 2013, {{scientists}} from Queen's University published a report analyzing lake sediments in the Athabasca region {{over the past}} fifty years. They found that levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) had increased as much as 23-fold since bitumen extraction began in the 1960s. Levels of carcinogenic, <b>mutagenic,</b> and teratogenic PAHs were substantially higher than guidelines for lake sedimentation set by the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment in 1999. The team discovered that the contamination spread farther than previously thought.|$|E
25|$|Enzymes in the {{cytochrome}} family (CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1) metabolize PAHs to diol epoxides. PAH exposure {{can increase}} {{production of the}} cytochrome enzymes, allowing the enzymes to convert PAHs into <b>mutagenic</b> diol epoxides at greater rates. In this pathway, PAH molecules bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and activate it as a transcription factor that increases production of the cytochrome enzymes. The activity of these enzymes may at times conversely protect against PAH toxicity, which is not yet well understood.|$|E
25|$|In humans, {{the protein}} is encoded by the RB1 gene located on {{chromosome}} 13—more specifically, 13q14.1-q14.2. If both alleles of this gene are mutated early in life, the protein is inactivated {{and results in}} development of retinoblastoma cancer, hence the name Rb. Retinal cells are not sloughed off or replaced, and are subjected {{to high levels of}} <b>mutagenic</b> UV radiation, and thus most pRB knock-outs occur in retinal tissue (but it's also been documented in certain skin cancers in patients from New Zealand where the amount of UV radiation is significantly higher).|$|E
25|$|PCBs {{have shown}} toxic and <b>mutagenic</b> effects by interfering with hormones in the body. PCBs, {{depending}} on the specific congener, {{have been shown to}} both inhibit and imitate estradiol, the main sex hormone in females. Imitation of the estrogen compound can feed estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells, and possibly cause other cancers, such as uterine or cervical. Inhibition of estradiol can lead to serious developmental problems for both males and females, including sexual, skeletal, and mental development issues. In a cross-sectional study, PCBs were found to be negatively associated with testosterone levels in adolescent boys.|$|E
25|$|For {{mitochondrial}} mutations {{the plan}} is not to repair them but to prevent harm from the mutations by putting suitably modified copies of the mitochondrial genes into the cell nucleus by gene therapy. The mitochondrial DNA experiences {{a high degree of}} <b>mutagenic</b> damage because most free radicals are generated in the mitochondria. A copy of the mitochondrial DNA located in the nucleus will be better protected from free radicals, and there will be better DNA repair when damage occurs. All mitochondrial proteins would then be imported into the mitochondria.|$|E
25|$|While it {{has been}} {{difficult}} to establish specific health effects in humans {{due to the lack of}} controlled dose experiments, studies in animals have shown that dioxin causes a wide variety of toxic effects. In particular, TCDD (see this) has been shown to be teratogenic, <b>mutagenic,</b> carcinogenic, immunotoxic, and hepatotoxic. Furthermore, alterations in multiple endocrine and growth factor systems have been reported. The most sensitive effects, observed in multiple species, appear to be developmental, including effects on the developing immune, nervous, and reproductive systems. The most sensitive effects are caused at body burdens relatively close to those reported in humans.|$|E
25|$|The Government of Gujarat had {{initiated}} {{a study in}} response to the workers' rally in Bhavnagar and representations made by Sishuvihar, an NGO based in Ahmadabad. The committee constituted for the study also included former Deputy Director of NIOH, Ahmadabad. The committee noted that the WHO, FAO, IARC and US EPA have indicated that endosulfan is not carcinogenic, not teratogenic, not <b>mutagenic</b> and not genotoxic. The highlight of this report is the farmer exposure study based on analysis of their blood reports for residues of endosulfan and the absence of any residues. This corroborates the lack of residues in worker-exposure studies.|$|E
25|$|Arthur's story resembles {{versions}} of the original Aquaman's. While awaiting transport to Miami, Florida, {{a young man named}} Arthur Joseph Curry is washed out to sea when a storm ruptures the tank he is in. This Arthur Curry, much like the Golden Age Aquaman, is the son of oceanobiologist Dr. Phillip Curry. Arthur's mother, Elaine, died in childbirth and Dr. Curry was forced to use a <b>mutagenic</b> serum on his son when he was born three months premature. Arthur has lived his whole life in the main tank of his father's research facility at Avalon Cay, his only window to the outside world being television.|$|E
