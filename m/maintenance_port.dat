5000|$|Resuming {{operations}} on 28 September, Duchess sailed to Scottish waters for exercises: first anti-submarine and torpedo firing training off Clyde, then plane guard duties near Rosyth while Eagles aircraft practiced high-altitude intercepts. After {{a visit to}} Hamburg, the destroyer returned to Portland. Exercises and port visits continued into 1956, and on 21 February, Duchess paid off and recommissioned at Portsmouth Dockyard. On 3 March, the destroyer sailed to rejoin the Mediterranean Fleet. After a series of working up exercises, Duchess participated in the 60-ship Exercise Medflex Dragon in April. During the exercise, the naval correspondent for The Daily Telegraph was convinced by the officers to place a small article in the paper jokingly asking for [...] "any spare coronets" [...] to decorate the wardroom with. In response, Anne, Duchess of Westminster, arranged to have her coronet supplied to the destroyer. Medflex Dragon concluded on 20 April, and Duchess underwent six weeks of <b>maintenance.</b> <b>Port</b> visits to Istanbul and Golcuck followed, along with a stint patrolling the Cyprus coastline to intercept Greek weapons smugglers. She returned to Malta in mid-July, and was in Grand Harbour when the Suez Canal was claimed and nationalised by Egypt.|$|E
40|$|Loss of coolant {{accident}} (LOCA) {{and loss}} of flow accident (LOFA) analysis is performed for ARIES-AT, an advanced fusion power plant design (1000 MWe). ARIES-AT employs a high performance, high temperature blanket system. It uses the high temperature SiC/SiC for structural material and LiPb for coolant-breeder. Due to the large difference between the time scale of plasma shutdown and the coolant or power loss, {{it is assumed that}} the plasma is immediately quenched {{at the onset of the}} LOCA/LOFA and the chamber components ' temperature begins to rise due to the decay heat generated. A 2 -D transient finite element model is established to examine the thermal behavior of the in-vessel components to determine the maximum temperature reached, the time, and duration of the peak. The model is axisymmetric in (r-z) around the reactor axis to show the details of temperature distribution in the vertical direction. The vacuum vessel is assumed adiabatic in the inboard side and radiates to the <b>maintenance</b> <b>port</b> located on the outboard side. The maximum temperature of steel in the reactor is about (600 °C- 700 °C) after about 4 days from the onset of the accident. The highest temperature in the reactor is in the divertor region and it reaches ≈ 1050 °C after about 2 - 3 hours. The analysis indicates that the reactor does not need any special scheme for decay heat removal. I...|$|E

40|$|The ARIES-RS tokamak {{power plant}} study {{developed}} a design approach {{which has the}} potential for high availability. One of the keys for high plant availability is a design that allows rapid replacement of the power core sectors. This is achieved by using large <b>maintenance</b> <b>ports</b> for each power core sector, enabling the removal of entire sectors composed of inboard and outboard blankets, neutron shields, and upper and lower divertors. Another important feature is the location of all connections to the cooling system inside the port area and outside the plasma chamber, avoiding contamination of the chamber by coolant leaks or handling operations. Any spread of radioactive particles (e. g. tritium or dust) is avoided by the use of flasks for the transfer of used sectors to the hot cells and return of new or refurbished sectors. It is estimated that the impact on availability is less than 5 % for scheduled maintenance of the power core. © 1998 Elsevier Science S. A. All rights reserved. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of high-density plasmas heated by neutral beam (NB) injection in a vertically elongated configuration using four poloidal coils {{has been investigated}} in LHD and shown {{to be better than}} that in the normal configuration using six poloidal coils. Reduction of poloidal coils is favorable in designing an LHD-type helical reactor FFHR-d 1, from both points of view of cost reduction and realization of large <b>maintenance</b> <b>ports.</b> In the experiment, no clear difference between the two configurations was recognized in the relation between the central density and the central pressure. Meanwhile, a factor Cexp used in the direct profile extrapolation (DPE) method is smaller in the vertically elongated configuration, where Cexp is proportional to the reactor size, Rreactor, at a given reactor magnetic field, Breactor, i. e., Rreactor ∝ CexpBreactor? 4 / 3. The difference in Cexp between the two configurations is enhanced to > 10 % as the plasma beta increases. This might be due to the larger plasma volume and/or the mitigated Shafranov shift in the vertically elongated configuration...|$|R
