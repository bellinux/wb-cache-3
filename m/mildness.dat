5|$|Little factual {{information}} survives about Vespasian's government during {{the ten years}} he was emperor, his reign {{is best known for}} financial reforms following the demise of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Vespasian was noted for his <b>mildness</b> and for loyalty to the people. For example, much money was spent on public works and the restoration and beautification of Rome: a new forum, the Temple of Peace, the public baths and the Colosseum.|$|E
25|$|His {{satisfactory}} record {{may also}} have been {{due to the fact that}} he survived his accession but a very short time, for he was thus given no opportunity for wrongdoing. For he lived after this only two years, two months and twenty days—in addition to the thirty-nine years, five months and twenty-five days he had already lived at that time. In this respect, indeed, he is regarded as having equalled the long reign of Augustus, since it is maintained that Augustus would never have been loved had he lived a shorter time, nor Titus had he lived longer. For Augustus, though at the outset he showed himself rather harsh because of the wars and the factional strife, was later able, in the course of time, to achieve a brilliant reputation for his kindly deeds; Titus, on the other hand, ruled with <b>mildness</b> and died at the height of his glory, whereas, if he had lived a long time, it might have been shown that he owes his present fame more to good fortune than to merit.|$|E

500|$|Members of the Massachusetts Bay Colony {{heard about}} Cotton's flight {{and sent him}} letters urging {{him to come to}} New England. [...] None of the great Puritan clergymen had gone there, and he felt that it would put him at too great a {{distance}} to return should the situation in England warrant. [...] Despite this, he made his decision to emigrate by the spring of 1633 and wrote a letter to Bishop Williams on 7 May, resigning from his pastorate at St. Botolph's and thanking the bishop for his flexibility and <b>mildness.</b> [...] By the summer, he had reunited with his wife, and the couple {{made their way to the}} coast of Kent. [...] In June or July 1633, the 48-year-old Cotton boarded the ship Griffin with his wife and step-daughter, along with fellow ministers Thomas Hooker and Samuel Stone. [...] Also on board was Edward Hutchinson, the oldest son of Anne Hutchinson who was traveling with his uncle Edward. [...] Cotton's wife was pregnant and bore their child during the voyage, and they named him Seaborn. [...] Eighteen months after his departure from England, Cotton wrote that his decision to emigrate was not difficult to make; he found preaching in a new land to be far preferable to [...] "sitting in a loathsome prison." ...|$|E
500|$|Mint Director Henry Linderman {{stated in}} 1873 of Peale, [...] "Although Mr. Peale {{undoubtedly}} received {{the cooperation of}} , the inventions and improvements were peculiarly Mr. Peale's. [...] I have no doubt whatever on that point. They were of almost incalculable value to the public service." [...] George G. Evans, in his late 19th century history of the Mint, described Peale, [...] "his <b>mildness,</b> integrity, gentlemanly bearing and high moral and mental culture constituted him a model officer". Walter Breen deemed Peale, [...] "brilliant but unscrupulous". Burdette writes of Peale and his effect on the Mint, [...] "during the generation from about 1830 to 1855, the greatest influence to operations and production came from one man: Benjamin Franklin Peale. He was the consummate 'machinist' of the {{day at a time}} when this term encompassed imaginative design, planning, construction and improvement of working processes... While he had the complete support of mint directors Moore and Patterson, he was also held in high esteem by the common mint workers and Philadelphia's scientific elite. Results of many of his ideas lasted a century or more, until growth in population made nineteenth century engineering insufficient for modern coinage needs." [...] According to Bowers, [...] "today Peale is one of several Mint people who can be viewed from many different angles, each perspective sometimes leading certain writers to draw widely differing conclusions." ...|$|E
500|$|Congregationalism {{became known}} as the [...] "New England Way", based on a {{membership}} limited to saved believers and a separation from all other churches in matters of government. Congregationalists wanted each church to have its own governance, but they generally opposed separation from the established Church of England. [...] The Puritans continued to view the Anglican Church as being the true church but needing reform from within. [...] Cotton became the [...] "chief helmsman" [...] for the Massachusetts Puritans in establishing congregationalism in New England, with his qualities of piety, learning, and <b>mildness</b> of temper. [...] Several of his books and much of his correspondence dealt with church polity, and one of his key sermons on the subject was his Sermon Deliver'd at Salem in 1636, given in the church that was forced to expel Roger Williams. [...] Cotton disagreed with Williams' separatist views, and he had hoped to convince him of his errors before his banishment. [...] His sermon in Salem was designed to keep the Salem church from moving further towards separation from the English church. [...] He felt that the church and the state should be separate to a degree but that they should be intimately related. [...] He considered the best organization for the state to be a Biblical model from the Old Testament. [...] He did not see democracy as being an option for the Massachusetts government, but instead felt that a theocracy would be the best model. It was in these matters that Roger Williams strongly disagreed with Cotton.|$|E
2500|$|Arvaikheer has a cold {{semi-arid}} climate (Köppen climate classification BSk) {{with mild}} summers and relatively mild winters by Mongolian standards.

It {{is located in a}} microclimate in the center of Mongolia which sees less harsh winters {{than the rest of the}} country. Its [...] elevation at the foot of the eastern hills of the Khangai Mountains augments its <b>mildness</b> by keeping it distant from cold air pools in low basins.

2500|$|Chickenpox {{occurs in}} all parts of the world. In 2013 there were 140 million cases of {{chickenpox}} and herpes zoster worldwide. Before routine immunization the number of cases occurring each year was similar to the number of people born. Since immunization the number of infections in the United States has decreased nearly 90%. In 2015 chickenpox resulted in 6,400 deaths globally – down from 8,900 in 1990. Death occurs in about 1 per 60,000 cases. Chickenpox was not separated from smallpox until the late 19th century. In 1888 its connection to shingles was determined. The first documented use of the term chicken pox was in 1658. Various explanations have been suggested for the use of [...] "chicken" [...] in the name, one being the relative <b>mildness</b> of the disease.|$|E
2500|$|Goss {{was noted}} for his piety and {{gentleness}} of character. His pupil, John Stainer, wrote, [...] "That Goss {{was a man}} of religious life was patent to all who came into contact with him, but an appeal to the general effect of his sacred compositions offers public proof of the fact." [...] His <b>mildness</b> was a disadvantage when attempting to deal with his recalcitrant singers. He was unable to do anything about the laziness of the tenors and basses, who had lifetime security of tenure and were uninterested in learning new music. The biographer Jeremy Dibble writes, [...] "Hostility to [...] fine anthem 'Blessed is the man', composed in 1842, undermined his confidence so markedly that he did not compose any further anthems until 1852, when he was commissioned to write two anthems for the state funeral of the Duke of Wellington".|$|E
2500|$|Within Aragon and its {{dependent}} territories, {{the number}} of individuals that the Spanish Inquisition tried for sodomy, between 1570 and 1630 was over 800 or nearly a thousand. In Spain, those whom the Spanish Inquisition convicted and had executed [...] "by burning without the benefit of strangulation" [...] were about 150. The Inquisition was harsh to sodomizers (more so for those committing bestiality than homosexuality), but tended to restrict death by burning only to those aged over twenty-five. Minors were normally whipped and sent to the galleys. <b>Mildness</b> was also shown to clergy, who were always a high proportion of those arrested. In fact, conviction and execution for sodomy was easier to obtain from the civil courts in other parts of Spain than from the tribunals of the Inquisition in Aragon, and there executions for sodomy were much more numerous. After 1633, where the Spanish Inquisition had jurisdiction for sodomy, it ceased treating it as requiring execution, and imposed lesser penalties in cases brought before it.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "Magnus {{inscription}}", a Latin {{inscription on}} 15 voussoirs arranged as a semi-circular arch, rescued {{by a local}} antiquarian from the rubble when the chancel of the old church was demolished in 1587 and erected in {{the wall of the}} nave in 1635, was reset, also surrounding a grave-slab, in the east exterior wall of the new church. The original stones, dating from around 1200, are in a medieval Lombardic script, but several have been re-carved. The inscription reads [...] "Clauditur hic miles Danorum regia proles Mangnus nomen ei mangne nota progeniei; deponens mangnum se moribus induit agnum, prepete pro vita fit parvulus anachorita", which translates as [...] "There enters this cell a warrior of Denmark's royal race; Magnus his name, mark of mighty lineage. [...] Casting off his Mightiness he takes the Lamb's <b>mildness,</b> and to gain everlasting life becomes a lowly anchorite". The verse plays on the anchorite's name being the same as the Latin word for [...] "great" [...] or [...] "mighty", magnus, here spelt mangnus.|$|E
2500|$|In 1671 Ormonde {{successfully}} opposed Richard Talbot's {{attempt to}} upset the Act of Settlement 1662. In 1673, he again visited Ireland, returned to London in 1675 to give advice to Charles on affairs in parliament, and in 1677 was again restored to favour and reappointed to the lord lieutenancy. On his arrival in Ireland he occupied himself in placing the revenue and the army upon a proper footing. Upon {{the outbreak of the}} disturbances caused by the Popish Plot (1678) in England, Ormonde at once took steps towards rendering the Roman Catholics, who were in the proportion of 15 to 1, powerless; and the <b>mildness</b> and moderation of his measures served as the ground of an attack upon him in England led by Shaftesbury, from which he was defended with great spirit by his own son Lord Ossory. While wary of defending Oliver Plunkett publicly, in private he denounced the obvious falsity of the charges against him - of the informers who claimed that Plunkett had hired them to kill the King he wrote that [...] "no schoolboy would have trusted them to rob an orchard".|$|E
2500|$|Riario's position, {{without a}} single vote in his favor, must have caused him to reconsider his position. [...] He was not papabile. [...] He {{therefore}} had to {{make some sort of}} accommodation with his enemy Medici. That night, in the main hall of the Conclave (the Sala Ducale?), the Cardinals and Conclavists observed Cardinal Medici and Cardinal Raffaele Riario in close conversation for more than an hour, although no other observer was able to make out the subject. [...] Between then and the time for the vote [...] next morning, a rumor spread among the cardinals as to the outcome of the conversation, and every other cardinal flocked to Medici's cell to congratulate him. Trollope claims that every cardinal did such because [...] "it is ill voting against a man to-day who is to be the despotic master of your fate and fortunes on the morrow". [...] Actually, the success of Medici was due to the unity of the 'Younger Cardinals' behind their chosen candidate, as much as to Medici's <b>mildness</b> and generosity toward friend and enemy, as Pio de Carpi explained to the Emperor Maximilian.|$|E
2500|$|The {{city walls}} were repaired; Minucius {{was put in}} charge of {{preparing}} a [...] "reception committee" [...] by raising 2 Roman and 2 allied legions and attached cavalry units to defend the city in nearby Tibur. The unwalled towns in Latium were ordered to be abandoned, and their inhabitants were moved into walled towns. Certain bridges were torn down to deny the Carthaginians easy passage through Latium. Once it was clear that Hannibal was not marching towards Rome, Fabius ordered the army of Servilius into Latium. Fabius left Rome, met and took over command of the army of Servilius near Narnia, or a few miles south at Ocriculum, then joined the army of Minucius at Tibur and marched along the via Appia into Apulia. Servilus was sent to command the Roman fleet at Ostia with the rank of proconsul. With the Roman army concentrated, Fabius needed to implement the next phase of his plans: how to defeat the Carthaginian army. Fabius in his childhood had been named ovicula (Little Sheep) for his <b>mildness</b> and willingness to follow others about, and in the coming months his activities gave the impression that he was doing his utmost to live up to that nickname.|$|E
2500|$|On 19 July 1940, Halder was {{promoted}} to Generaloberst, an equivalent of a modern NATO Four-Star General. In August, he began working on Operation Barbarossa, the invasion plan for the Soviet Union. Shortly thereafter, to curtail Halder’s military-command power, Hitler limited {{his involvement in the}} war by restricting him to developing battle plans for only the Eastern Front. On 17 March 1941, in a secret meeting with Halder {{and the rest of the}} most senior generals, Hitler stated that Germany was to disregard all of the rules of war in the East, and the war against the Soviet Union was to be a war of annihilation (Vernichtungskrieg). Halder, who was so vocal in arguing with Hitler about military matters, made no protest. On 30 March 1941, in another secret speech to his leading generals, Hitler described the sort of war he wanted Operation Barbarossa to be (according to the notes taken by Halder), a:"Struggle between two ideologies. Scathing evaluation of Bolshevism, equals antisocial criminality. Communism immense future danger...This a fight to the finish. If we do not accept this, we shall beat the enemy, but in thirty years we shall again confront the Communist foe. We don't make war to preserve the enemy...Struggle against Russia: Extermination of Bolshevik Commissars and of the Communist intelligentsia...Commissars and GPU personnel are criminals and must be treated as such. The struggle will differ from that in the west. In the east harshness now means <b>mildness</b> for the future." [...] Though General Halder's notes did not record any mention of Jews, the German historian Andreas Hillgruber argued that, because of Hitler's frequent statements at the same time about the coming war of annihilation against [...] "Judeo-Bolshevism", his generals could not have misunderstood that Hitler's call for the total destruction of the Soviet Union also comprised a call for the total destruction of the Jewish population of the Soviet Union.|$|E
2500|$|The second view of Saul {{makes him}} {{appear in the}} most {{favourable}} light as man, as hero, and as king. This view {{is similar to that}} of the monarchical source. In this view it was on account of his modesty that he did not reveal the fact that he had been anointed king (1 Samuel 10:16; Meg. 13b); and he was extraordinarily upright as well as perfectly just. Nor was there any one more pious than he (M. Q. 16b; Ex. Rashi 30:12); for when he ascended the throne he was as pure as a child, and had never committed sin (Yoma 22b). He was marvelously handsome; and the maidens who told him concerning Samuel (cf 1 Samuel 9:11–13) talked so long with him that they might observe his beauty the more (Ber. 48b). In war he was able to march 120 miles without rest. When he received the command to smite Amalek (1 Samuel 15:3), Saul said: For one found slain the Torah requires a sin offering and here so many shall be slain. If the old have sinned, why should the young suffer; and if men have been guilty, why should the cattle be destroyed? It was this <b>mildness</b> that cost him his crown. And while Saul was merciful to his enemies, he was strict with his own people; when he found out that Ahimelech, a kohen, had assisted David with finding food, Saul, in retaliation, killed the rest of the 85 kohanim of the family of Ahimelech and the rest of his hometown, Nov. ( [...] ; Num. Rashi 1:10) The fact that he was merciful even to his enemies, being indulgent to rebels themselves, and frequently waiving the homage due to him, was incredible as well as deceiving. But if his mercy toward a foe was a sin, it was his only one; and it was his misfortune that it was reckoned against him, while David, although he had committed much iniquity, was so favored that it was not remembered to his injury (Yoma 22b; M. Q. 16b, and Rashi ad loc.). In some respects Saul was superior to David, e.g., in having only one concubine {Rizpah}, while David had many. Saul expended his own substance for the war, and although he knew that he and his sons would fall in battle, he nevertheless went forward, while David heeded the wish of his soldiers not to go to war in person (2 Samuel 21:17; Lev. Rashi 26:7; Yalq., Sam. 138).|$|E
