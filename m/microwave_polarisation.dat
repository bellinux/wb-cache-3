40|$|We {{consider}} {{the application of}} a small in-plane magnetic field to electrons on a helium surface in a perpendicular magnetic field. Certain states that were bound to the helium surface then dissolve into the continuum turning into long-lived resonances. As a result microwave absorption lines acquire an asymmetric Fano lineshape that is tunable by varying the <b>microwave</b> <b>polarisation</b> or the in-plane magnetic field. Electrons trapped in a formerly bound state will tunnel off the surface of helium; we show that under suitable circumstances this ``radioactive decay'' can show damped oscillations rather than a simple exponential decay. The mechanism for oscillatory exponential decay is not specific to electrons on Helium and this effect may also be relevant elsewhere in physics. Comment: 4 pages, 1 figure, submitted to PR...|$|E

L-MEB parameters are key ancillary information for the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity mission (SMOS) retrieval algorithm that produces estimates of the surface soil moisture from measurements of the surface brightness temperature at L-band. L-band data sets from three ground-based experiments over grass are analysed in this paper: BARC (orchard grass and alfalfa), ELBARA-ETH (clover grass), and SMOSREX (grass and litter from a field left fallow). Modelling of the brightness temperature using the zero-th order radiative transfer model in L-MEB indicates that the vegetation appears isotropic to microwaves propagating with horizontal polarisation, and that the single scattering albedo can be neglected. At vertical polarisation, non-zero scattering is observed for all the grass data sets. Surface soil moisture is retrieved with enough accuracy for all data sets as long as the soil and litter emission are calibrated beforehand. Then surface soil moisture and vegetation optical depth can be left as free parameters in the retrieval process. Finally, the study highlights the importance of detecting strong emission and attenuation by wet vegetation and litter due to rainfall interception in order to obtain accurate estimates of the surface soil moisture.

However, {{little is known about}} their evolution and the processes responsible for their development and disappearance despite a probable influence on the surface mass balance and energy budget. To investigate hoar evolution, we use continuous observations of the surface by in situ near-infrared photography and by passive microwave remote sensing at Dome C in Antarctica. From the photography data, we retrieved a daily indicator of the presence/absence of hoar crystals using a texture analysis algorithm. The analysis of this 2 yr long time series shows that Dome C surface is covered almost half of the time by hoar. The development of hoar crystals takes a few days and seems to occur whatever the meteorological conditions. In contrast, the disappearance of hoar is rapid (a few hours) and coincident with either strong winds or with moderate winds associated with a change in wind direction from southwest (the prevailing direction) to southeast. From the microwave satellite data, we computed the polarisation ratio (i. e. horizontal over vertical polarised brightness temperatures), an indicator known to be sensitive to hoar in Greenland. Photography data and <b>microwave</b> <b>polarisation</b> ratio are correlated, i. e. high values of polarisation ratio which theoretically correspond to low snow density values near the surface are associated with the presence of hoar crystals in the photography data. Satellite data over nearly ten years (2002 – 2011) confirm that a strong decrease of the polarisation ratio (i. e. signature of hoar disappearance) is associated with an increase of wind speed or a change in wind direction from the prevailing direction. The photography data provides, in addition, evidence of interactions between hoar and snowfall. Further adding the combined influence of wind speed and wind direction results in a complex picture of the snow–atmosphere interactions in Antarctica which deserves further quantification and modelling...|$|E

Operation is, therefore, interlocked with both plasma current and density above a given threshold.

During regular inspections, however, damages were reported {{in the vicinity of the}} launchers and in particular around the tiles of the heat shield.

40|$|Subject of {{this paper}} is the weak lensing effect on galaxies that show {{intrinsically}} correlated ellipticities. In our model, we investigate the distortion of the ellipticity field if the galaxies experience an apparent shift in their position by weak lensing deflection and compare this effect to the shearing effect induced by tidal fields. Starting with a derivation of intrinsic ellipticity spectra by employing a tidal torquing model generating galactic angular momenta, we model the galaxy ellipticity by assuming that the galactic disk forms perpendicularly to the host halo angular momentum direction and derive intrinsic ellipticity E-mode and B-mode spectra from the angular momentum statistics. The lensing effect on the ellipticity field is modeled by employing the methodology developed in the framework of lensing of the cosmic <b>microwave</b> background <b>polarisation.</b> For EUCLID, ellipticity correlations are altered by lensing deflection on multipoles l> 1000 by ~ 5 % for the ellipticity E-modes and by ~ 30 % for the B-modes, while a shallower survey would exhibit larger changes on larger angular scales. In addition to the convolving effect of lensing on the ellipticity spectra we investigate the E/B-mode conversion, and discuss the possibility of measuring correlations between different multipoles which is evoked by the homogeneity breaking effect of the lensing displacement. Our conclusion is that although shape correlations generated by weak gravitational shear is dominant, the shifting effect due to lensing is shaping the ellipticity spectra on small angular scales and causes a number of interesting phenomena, which might be observable by future surveys.

We study how the cross-correlation between the CMB polarisation (E-modes) and the 21 cm line fluctuations {{can be used}} to gain further understanding of the reionisation history, within the framework of inhomogeneous reionisation. Since the E-mode polarisation reflects the amplitude of the quadrupole component of the CMB temperature fluctuations, the angular power spectrum of the cross-correlation exhibits oscillations at all multipoles. The first peak of the power spectrum appears at the scale corresponding to the quadrupole at the redshift that is probed by the 21 cm line fluctuations. The peak reaches its maximum value in redshift when the average ionisation fraction of the universe is about half. On the other hand, on small scales, there is a damping that depends on the duration of reionisation. Thus, the cross-correlation between the CMB polarisation and the 21 cm line fluctuations has the potential to constrain accurately the epoch and the duration of reionisation.

This non-thermality cancels exactly between the ground-state estimate and its free quasiparticle excitations. Kinematic constraints in 4 -vertex scattering and the counting of radial loop variables versus the number of independent constraints on them are re-visited. Next, we consider thermal 2 → 2 one-loop scattering of the modes remaining massless upon the (anti) caloron induced adjoint Higgs mechanism (thermal ground state after spatial coarse graining). Starting with stringent analytical arguments, we are able to exclude the contribution to photon-photon scattering from diagrams containing at least one three-vertex and, in a next step, a vast majority of all possible configurations involving two four-vertices. By numerical analysis we show that the remaining contribution of the overall S channel is severely suppressed compared to that of the T and U channels, meaning that the creation of a pair of massive vector modes by a pair of photons and vice versa practically does not occur in the Yang-Mills plasma. For the T and U channels the domain of loop integration represents less than 10 ^- 7 times the volume of the unconstrained integration region.

40|$|We {{implement}} {{the theory of}} resonant scattering {{in the context of}} Cosmic <b>Microwave</b> Background (CMB) <b>polarisation</b> anisotropies. We compute the changes in the E-mode polarisation (EE) and Temperature E-mode (TE) CMB power spectra introduced by the scattering on a resonant transition with a given optical depth τ_X and polarisation coefficient E_ 1. The latter parameter, accounting for how anisotropic the scattering is, depends on the exchange of angular momentum in the transition and enables, a priori, to distinguish among different possible resonances. We use this formalism in two different scenarios: cosmological recombination and cosmological reionisation. In the context of cosmological recombination, we compute predictions in frequency and multipole space for the change in the TE and EE power spectra introduced by scattering on the H_α and P_α lines of Hydrogen. This constitutes a fundamental test for the standard model of recombination, and the sensitivity it requires is comparable to that needed in measuring the primordial CMB B-mode polarisation component. In the context of reionisation, we study the scattering off metals and ions produced by the first stars, and find that polarisation anisotropies, apart from providing a consistency test for intensity measurements, give some insight on how reionisation evolved: since they keep memory of how anisotropic the line scattering is, {{they should be able to}} discern the OI 63. 2 μm transition from other possible transitions associated to OIII, NII, NIII, etc. The amplitude of these signals are, however, between 10 to 100 times below the (already challenging) level of CMB B-mode polarisation anisotropies.

Spin-SILC is an internal linear combination method that uses spin wavelets to analyse the spin- 2 polarisation signal $P = Q + iU$. The wavelets are additionally directional (non-axisymmetric). This allows different morphologies of signals to be separated and therefore the cleaning algorithm is localised using an additional domain of information. The advantage of spin wavelets over standard scalar wavelets is to simultaneously and self-consistently probe scales and directions in the polarisation signal $P = Q + iU$ and in the underlying $E$ and $B$ modes, therefore providing the ability to perform component separation and $E$-$B$ decomposition concurrently for the first time. We test Spin-SILC on full-mission Planck simulations and data and show the capacity to correctly recover the underlying cosmological $E$ and $B$ modes. We also demonstrate a strong consistency of our CMB maps with those derived from existing component separation methods. Spin-SILC can be combined with the pseudo- and pure $E$-$B$ spin wavelet estimators presented in a companion paper to reliably extract the cosmological signal {{in the presence of}} complicated sky cuts and noise.

Nongaussiaity is not generated at rst order and is directly proportional to the primordial Nongaussianity of in ation. Thus B-mode polarisation and Nongaussianity constrain in ation models directly. While E-mode polarisation has already been detected and is being observed with increasing precision, B-mode polarisation and Nongaussianity remains elusive. The absence of B-mode polarisation when the primordial uctuations are purely scalar holds, however, only in linear perturbation theory. B-mode polarisation is also generated from scalar sources in second order, which may constitute an important background to the search for primordial gravitational waves. While such an eect would naturally be expected to be relevant at tensor-to-scalar ratios of order 10 - 5, which is the size of perturbations in the microwave background, only a full second order calculation can tell whether there are no enhancements. For Nongaussianity the situation is analogous: At second order intrinsic Nongaus-sianities are induced to the spectrum, which may be an important background to the primordial Nongaussianity. After the full second-order Boltzmann equations for the cosmological evolution of the polarised radiation distribution have become available, I focused on the novel sources to B-mode polarisation that appear in the second-order collision term, which have not been calculated before.

To achieve this, they will analyse huge datasets, involving years worth of time-ordered data (TOD) from massively multi-detector focal planes. This creates the need for fast and precise methods to complement the M-L approach in analysis pipelines. In this paper, we investigate fast map-making methods as applied to long duration, massively multi-detector, ground-based experiments, {{in the context of}} the search for B-modes. We focus on two alternative map-making approaches: destriping and TOD filtering, comparing their performance on simulated multi-detector polarisation data. We have written an optimised, parallel destriping code, the DEStriping CARTographer DESCART, that is generalised for massive focal planes, including the potential effect of cross-correlated TOD 1 /f noise. We also determine the scaling of computing time for destriping as applied to a simulated full-season data-set for a realistic experiment. We find that destriping can out-perform filtering in estimating both the large-scale E and B-mode angular power spectra. In particular, filtering can produce significant spurious B-mode power via EB mixing. Whilst this can be removed, it contributes to the variance of B-mode bandpower estimates at scales near the primordial B-mode peak. For the experimental configuration we simulate, this has an effect on the possible detection significance for primordial B-modes. Destriping is a viable alternative fast method to the full M-L approach that does not cause the problems associated with filtering, and is flexible enough to fit into both M-L and Monte-Carlo pseudo-Cl pipelines.

The <b>polarisation</b> signal is so low and difficult to measure that very accurate modelling and a deep understanding and characterisation of the instruments used to make such measurements is essential. The two instruments investigated in this thesis are the Millimetre-Wave Bolometric Interferometer (MBI) and the Q and U Bolometric Interferometer for Cosmology (QUBIC), both of which are collaborations between institutes in Europe and the United States. A prototype of MBI called MBI- 4 has already been built and has been used for experimental observations. The main aim of this prototype has been to prove the concept of bolometric interferometry for measurements of the CMB. In this thesis the optical combiner of MBI- 4 is designed and modelled in detail, taking into account mechanical tolerances and truncations effects, amongst others. The QUBIC instrument is currently in the design stage, having evolved from both MBI- 4 and BRAIN, an experiment located in Antarctica as a test for a more elaborate instrument. The optical design of QUBIC is also analysed, including a physical optics analysis of lenses, although not in the same detail as MBI- 4. A number of techniques are used in this analysis, including Gaussian beam modes and physical optics, to allow for a complete model of the optical systems to be obtained. As part of this modelling, a mode-matching technique is applied to predict the beam patterns of horn antennas. In this thesis, the technique is extended to include a transition from rectangular to circular waveguide geometries as such a junction occurs in the MBI back-to-back horns.
