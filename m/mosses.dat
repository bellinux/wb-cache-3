50|$|Rhytidiadeplus loreusis {{is similar}} to many {{contrasting}} species of <b>moss.</b> It {{is considered to be}} part of the feather <b>moss</b> species. The species that is the most similar hail from the Rhytidiadelphus and Kinbergia genera. Two plants in particular are the Bent- leaf <b>moss</b> and the Goose-necked <b>moss.</b> The goose-necked <b>moss's</b> branches do not grow to the same height as the Lanky <b>Moss</b> branches. The Kindbergia species that is located in British Columbia is different compared to the Ryhytidiadeplus loreusis because of its smaller size with a complex branch structure.The Oregon Beaked <b>Moss</b> or Kindbergia oregana is a yellow- light green <b>moss</b> compared to Lanky <b>Moss</b> and grows in a similar loose mat structure. The Oregon Beaked <b>Moss</b> is similarly a coastal <b>moss</b> species and grows at similar elevations on decaying logs or in an epiphytic manner like the Lanky <b>Moss.</b> Its major difference is that it is more contained and regular in its growth patterns compared to the Lanky <b>Moss.</b> The Slender Beaked <b>Moss</b> or Kindbergia praelonga is also like the Lanky <b>Moss</b> because of its irregularity in structure and growth.|$|R
5|$|<b>Mosses</b> and lichens now cover {{much of the}} island. During the island's first 20years, 20species {{of plants}} were {{observed}} {{at one time or}} another, but only 10 became established in the nutrient-poor sandy soil.|$|E
5|$|Bauer's {{favorite}} subject was Swedish nature, the dense forests {{where the light}} trickled down through the tree canopies. Ever since he was little he had wandered in the dark woods of Småland imagining all the creatures living there.

50|$|<b>Moss</b> Landing was {{originally}} called <b>Moss.</b> The <b>Moss</b> post office opened in 1895, and {{changed its name}} to <b>Moss</b> Landing in 1917. The name honors Charles <b>Moss,</b> who with a partner, built a wharf there. The port was a busy whaling port.|$|R
5|$|The Moss {{contains}} several {{varieties of}} heather, {{as well as}} the purple moor grass Molinia caerulea. Ferns and gorse are common too, and in areas where peat has been cut in the past, there are bog <b>mosses,</b> the bog bean Menyanthus trifoliata, and marsh pennywort.|$|E
5|$|The Rhynia {{plant was}} small and stick-like, with simple dichotomously {{branching}} stems without leaves, each tipped by a sporangium. The simple form echoes that of the sporophyte of <b>mosses,</b> {{and it has been}} shown that Rhynia had an alternation of generations, with a corresponding gametophyte in the form of crowded tufts of diminutive stems only a few millimetres in height. Rhynia thus falls midway between <b>mosses</b> and early vascular plants like ferns and clubmosses. From a carpet of moss-like gametophytes, the larger Rhynia sporophytes grew much like simple clubmosses, spreading by means of horizontal growing stems growing rhizoids that anchored the plant to the substrate. The unusual mix of moss-like and vascular traits and the extreme structural simplicity of the plant had huge implications for botanical understanding.|$|E
5|$|The {{eastern part}} of the island is a lowland plateau, with {{isolated}} ponds and gently rolling hills. There is low but abundant vegetation, consisting of <b>mosses,</b> lichens, liverworts, ferns, grasses, sedges, and crowberry. The center of the island is mountainous, and the western end is barren and vegetation is sparse.|$|E

5|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass have an {{important}} function in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and grey hair-grass help to bind the sand. Sea holly, sand sedge, bird's-foot trefoil and pyramidal orchid are other specialists of this arid habitat. Some specialised <b>mosses</b> and lichens are found on the dunes, and help to consolidate the sand; a survey in September 2009 found 41 lichen species. The plant distribution {{is influenced by the}} dunes' age as well as their moisture content, the deposits becoming less alkaline as calcium carbonate from animal shells is leached out of the sand to be replaced by more acidic humus from plant decomposition products. Marram grass is particularly discouraged by the change in acidity. A similar pattern is seen with <b>mosses</b> and lichens, with the various areas of the dunes containing different species according to the acidity of the sand. At least four moss species have been identified as important in dune stabilization, since they help to consolidate the sand, add nutrients as they decompose, and pave the way for more exacting plant species. The moss and lichen flora of Blakeney Point differs markedly from that of lime-rich dunes on the western coasts of the UK. Non-native tree lupins have become established near the Lifeboat House, where they now grow wild.|$|E
5|$|Grassland on the Helvellyn range {{has been}} heavily overgrazed for many years, yet it {{supports}} {{a diversity of}} acid grassland species including sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina) on the summit ridge, matgrass (Nardus stricta) on the middle slopes, and fescue-bent swards on the lower slopes. The Nardus grasslands are the haunt of the scarce mountain ringlet butterfly (Erebia epiphron), the only alpine species of butterfly found in Britain. Acidic flushes (areas of water seepage) with their carpets of sphagnum <b>mosses</b> are common. Less common are basic flushes, which support a greater diversity of species.|$|E
5|$|Hygrophorus olivaceoalbus creates mycorrhizae with conifers. In the West Coast of the United States, {{associations}} are most common with Sitka spruces and giant redwoods. In the Rocky Mountains it associates with Engelmann spruce and blue spruce, and in northeast North America with hemlocks. It usually favours acidic and chalky ground with <b>mosses</b> in higher altitudes {{as well as}} conifer forests and occasionally mixed forests. The fruit bodies are often found singly, but may also grow in clusters.|$|E

5|$|In 1906, Charles Horton Peck {{described}} the variety magna from material collected in North Elba, New York. Peck {{explained that the}} variety differed from the typical species in several ways: var. magna grew among fallen leaves under balsam fir trees, or among <b>mosses</b> on the ground, not on buried wood; it lacked a stem, and was instead broad and rounded underneath; its hymenium was more yellow-brown then the nominate variety; and, its spore were slightly longer.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe saliceticola {{grows in}} {{mycorrhizal}} association with willow trees, {{and it is}} for this that the species is named. However, particular species favoured by the fungus are unclear and may include beech and alder taxa. The mushrooms grow from the ground, often among <b>mosses</b> or detritus. I.saliceticola was first described in 2009, and within the genus Inocybe, the species {{is a part of the}} section Marginatae. The species has been recorded in Finland and Sweden and is relatively common in some areas.|$|E
5|$|Kohala's native Hawaiian {{rain forest}} has {{a thick layer}} of ferns and <b>mosses</b> {{carpeting}} the floor, which act as sponges, absorbing water from rain and passing much of it through to the groundwater in aquifers below; when feral animals like pigs trample the covering, the forest loses its ability to hold in water effectively, and instead of recharging the aquifer, it results in a severe loss of topsoil, much of which ends up being dumped by streams into the ocean.|$|E
