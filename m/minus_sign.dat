5|$|Neutron {{interferometry}} {{has been}} used to investigate the Aharonov–Bohm effect, {{to examine the effects of}} gravity acting on an elementary particle, and to demonstrate a strange behavior of fermions that is at the basis of the Pauli exclusion principle: Unlike macroscopic objects, when fermions are rotated by 360° about any axis, they do not return to their original state, but develop a <b>minus</b> <b>sign</b> in their wave function. In other words, a fermion needs to be rotated 720° before returning to its original state.|$|E
25|$|The en dash is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} substitute for the <b>minus</b> <b>sign,</b> when the <b>minus</b> <b>sign</b> character is not available, since the en dash is usually the same width as a plus sign. For example, the original 8-bit Macintosh character set had an en dash, useful for the <b>minus</b> <b>sign,</b> years before Unicode with a dedicated <b>minus</b> <b>sign</b> was available. The hyphen-minus is usually too narrow to make a typographically acceptable <b>minus</b> <b>sign.</b> However, the en dash cannot be used for a <b>minus</b> <b>sign</b> in programming languages because the syntax usually requires a hyphen-minus.|$|E

50|$|Here {{velocity}} components {{will be used}} {{as opposed}} to speed for greater generality, and in order to avoid perhaps seemingly ad hoc introductions of <b>minus</b> <b>signs.</b> <b>Minus</b> <b>signs</b> occurring here will instead serve to illuminate features when speeds less than that of light are considered.|$|R

25|$|The <b>minus</b> <b>signs,</b> {{in front}} of the {{right-hand}} sides, mean that the pressure (and hydraulic head) are larger after the pipe expansion.|$|R
25|$|Direction of {{movement}} is indicated via an operator symbol. A plus sign {{is used to}} indicate forward movement. A <b>minus</b> <b>sign</b> is used to indicate backwards movement. A dot or period or equal sign is used to indicate horizontal or lateral movement. For a piece that moves diagonally (such as the horse or elephant), the plus or <b>minus</b> <b>sign</b> is used rather than the period.|$|E
25|$|The <b>minus</b> <b>sign</b> {{applies to}} a {{foreground}} object, and the plus sign applies to a background object.|$|E

50|$|For plus and <b>minus</b> <b>signs,</b> the hieroglyphs D54-and-D55 were used: if {{the feet}} pointed into the {{direction}} of writing, it signified addition, otherwise subtraction.|$|R
25|$|It is {{possible}} to express any trigonometric function in terms of any other (up to a plus or <b>minus</b> <b>sign,</b> or using the sign function).|$|E
25|$|Some vectors {{transform}} like contravariant vectors, {{except that}} when they are reflected through a mirror, they flip and gain a <b>minus</b> <b>sign.</b> A transformation that switches right-handedness to left-handedness and vice versa like a mirror does is said to change the orientation of space. A vector which gains a <b>minus</b> <b>sign</b> when the orientation of space changes is called a pseudovector or an axial vector. Ordinary vectors are sometimes called true vectors or polar vectors to distinguish them from pseudovectors. Pseudovectors occur most frequently as the cross product of two ordinary vectors.|$|E

25|$|It can {{be shown}} that self-dual {{configurations}} obeying the relation Fμνa = ± ½ εμναβ Fαβa minimize the action. Solutions with a plus sign are called instantons, those with the <b>minus</b> <b>sign</b> are anti-instantons.|$|E
25|$|The <b>minus</b> <b>sign</b> arises {{because of}} the sense the current i2 has been defined in the diagram. With both {{currents}} defined going into the dots the sign of M will be positive (the equation would read with a plus sign instead).|$|E
25|$|With {{the plus}} sign, the {{derivative}} is everywhere positive, so {{that for a}} background object, the blur disk size increases with focal length. With the <b>minus</b> <b>sign,</b> the derivative is everywhere negative, so that for a foreground object, the blur disk size decreases with focal length.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{relationship}} between the number of <b>minus</b> <b>signs</b> in a generalized sumset, A+ · · ·+A − · · · −A, and its cardinality; without loss of generality we may assume there are at least as many positive signs as negative signs. As addition is commutative and subtraction is not, we expect that for most A a combination with more <b>minus</b> <b>signs</b> has more elements than one with fewer; however, recently Iyer, Lazarev, Miller and Zhang [ILMZ] proved that a positive percentage of the time the combination with fewer <b>minus</b> <b>signs</b> can have more elements. Their analysis involves choosing sets A uniformly at random from { 0, [...] ., N}; this is equivalent to independently choosing each element of { 0, [...] ., N} to be in A with probability 1 / 2. We investigate what happens when instead each element is chosen with probability p(N), with limN→ ∞ p(N) = 0. We prove that the set with more <b>minus</b> <b>signs</b> is larger with probability 1 as N → ∞ if p(N) = cN−δ for δ ≥ h− 1 h, where h is the number of total summands in A+ · · ·+A− · · ·−A, and explicitly quantify their relative sizes. The results generalize earlier work of Hegarty and Miller [HM], and we see a phas...|$|R

25|$|The {{connection}} between frequency and wavevector, ω=ω(k), {{is known as}} a dispersion relation. The plus sign results in the so-called optical mode, and the <b>minus</b> <b>sign</b> to the acoustic mode. In the optical mode two adjacent different atoms move against each other, while in the acoustic mode they move together.|$|E
25|$|The figure dash is used within numbers (e.g. {{phone number}} 555‒0199), {{especially}} in columns for maintaining alignment. Its meaning {{is the same}} as a hyphen, as represented by the hyphen-minus glyph; by contrast, the en dash is more appropriately used to indicate a range of values; the <b>minus</b> <b>sign</b> also has a separate glyph.|$|E
25|$|More {{elaborate}} {{reactions are}} represented by reaction schemes, which in addition to starting materials and products show important intermediates or transition states. Also, some relatively minor additions to the reaction can be indicated above the reaction arrow; examples of such additions are water, heat, illumination, a catalyst, etc. Similarly, some minor products can be placed below the arrow, often with a <b>minus</b> <b>sign.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{relative}} risks—the rating grades—are usually {{expressed through}} some variation of an alphabetical combination of lower- and uppercase letters, with either plus or <b>minus</b> <b>signs</b> or numbers added to further fine-tune the rating.|$|R

25|$|The dash is a {{punctuation}} {{mark that}} is similar in appearance to a hyphen or <b>minus</b> <b>sign,</b> but differs from both of these symbols primarily in length and function. The most common versions of the dash are the en dash (–) and the longer em dash (—), whose names historically were loosely related with {{the length of a}} lower-case n and upper-case M, respectively, in commonly used typefaces.|$|E
25|$|One {{example of}} a pseudovector is angular {{velocity}}. Driving in a car, and looking forward, each of the wheels has an angular velocity vector pointing to the left. If the world is reflected in a mirror which switches {{the left and right}} side of the car, the reflection of this angular velocity vector points to the right, but the actual angular velocity vector of the wheel still points to the left, corresponding to the <b>minus</b> <b>sign.</b> Other examples of pseudovectors include magnetic field, torque, or more generally any cross product of two (true) vectors.|$|E
25|$|A finite set of k-simplexes {{embedded}} {{in an open}} subset of Rn is called an affine k-chain. The simplexes in a chain need not be unique; they may occur with multiplicity. Rather than using standard set notation to denote an affine chain, it is instead the standard practice to use plus signs to separate each member in the set. If some of the simplexes have the opposite orientation, these are prefixed by a <b>minus</b> <b>sign.</b> If some of the simplexes occur in the set more than once, these are prefixed with an integer count. Thus, an affine chain takes the symbolic form of a sum with integer coefficients.|$|E
