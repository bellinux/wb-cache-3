5|$|A {{government}} inquiry held {{jointly by}} the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the Environment Agency was started, but calls for a full public inquiry were declined. The Board included Tony Newton, Baron Newton of Braintree; Prof Dougal Drysdale, an authority on fire safety; and Dr Peter Baxter, a <b>medical</b> <b>expert.</b> Environment Agency and HSE staff were also on the board. Its aim was to identify the immediate causes of the explosion, rather than consider who was to blame for any deficiencies, {{so as not to}} prejudice further legal proceedings.|$|E

5|$|The cabin {{located on}} the main deck {{underneath}} the sterncastle {{is thought to have}} belonged to the barber-surgeon. He was a trained professional who saw to the health and welfare of the crew and acted as the <b>medical</b> <b>expert</b> on board. The most important of these finds were found in an intact wooden chest which contained over 60 objects relating to the barber-surgeon's medical practice: the wooden handles of a complete set of surgical tools and several shaving razors (although none of the steel blades had survived), a copper syringe for wound irrigation and treatment of gonorrhoea, and even a skilfully crafted feeding bottle for feeding incapacitated patients. More objects were found around the cabin, such as earscoops, shaving bowls and combs. With this wide selection of tools and medicaments the barber-surgeon, along with one or more assistants, could set bone fractures, perform amputations and deal with other acute injuries, treat a number of diseases and provide crew members with a minimal standard of personal hygiene.|$|E

5|$|Palomeque {{was found}} dead on August 22, 2009. His {{body was found in}} a river near the town of El Rosario, Sinaloa. According to a bus driver who was {{transporting}} Palomeque and other passengers to Mexico City on Friday night August 20, Palomeque became agitated, panicked and demanded to be let off the bus despite it being 1:30 in the morning. A text message he sent to his wife after leaving the bus confirms that Palomeque found himself lost on the dark hillside. After receiving the text message, his wife contacted local wrestling promoter Vicente Martinez, who organized a search party. On the morning of August 22, Palomeque was found floating face down in the river. Afterwards, <b>medical</b> <b>expert</b> Jesús Enrique Castro López stated that such an anxiety attack could be steroid related, but Palomeque's alleged steroid abuse has not been confirmed. An autopsy was carried out on August 23, which determined that {{the cause of death was}} drowning, and no further investigation into the death is planned. A memorial was held in Mexico City on August 24 for friends and family of Palomeque, many of whom showed up without their masks on, to keep the focus of the event on Palomeque. His body was subsequently cremated, with the ashes taken to Villahermosa to be buried.|$|E
5|$|Project Alberta, {{also known}} as Project A, was formed in March 1945, {{absorbing}} existing groups of Parsons's O Division that were working on bomb preparation and delivery. These included Ramsey's O-2 (Delivery) Group, Birch's O-1 (Gun) Group, Bainbridge's X-2 (Development, Engineering, and Tests) Group, Brode's O-3 (Fuse Development) Group and George Galloway's O-4 (Engineering) Group. Its role was to support the bomb delivery effort. Parsons became the head of Project Alberta, with Ramsey as his scientific and technical deputy, and Ashworth as his operations officer and military alternate. In all, Project Alberta consisted of 51 Army, Navy and civilian personnel. The 1st Technical Service Detachment, to which the personnel of Project Alberta were administratively assigned, was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Peer de Silva, and provided security and housing services on Tinian. There were two bomb assembly teams, a Fat Man Assembly Team under Commander Norris Bradbury and Roger Warner, and a Little Boy Assembly Team under Birch. Philip Morrison {{was the head of}} the Pit Crew, Bernard Waldman and Luis Alvarez led the Aerial Observation Team, and Sheldon Dike was in charge of the Aircraft Ordnance Team.

The two IV infusions were administered at his home, amounted to 16% of the total average male blood quantity, and contained saline, multivitamins and vitamin C. The World Anti-Doping Agency forbids such {{a large amount of}} fluids entering the body before competition as a preventive step against the possible masking of performance-enhancing drug use. Bob Bennett, {{the executive director of the}} Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC), stated that unless the IV was administered at a hospital, it needs to be cleared by filing a therapeutic-use exemption, and supporting documents through the Nevada commission and authorized by the commission’s <b>medical</b> <b>expert.</b> The Pacquiao camp had requested an injection of the anti-inflammatory Toradol for Pacquiao's injured shoulder before the fight, but was denied authorization by NSAC.

40|$|This {{study is}} an attempt to {{consider}} the role of translation competence of <b>medical</b> <b>experts</b> who are self-translating medical research abstracts from English into Kurdish. To do so, it investigates a corpus of research abstracts terminologically, syntactically and textually in order to identify and establish the translation competence of the <b>medical</b> <b>experts.</b> The study adopts the descriptive approach to translation for the purpose of its investigation within the frame of which it employs Toury’s methodology in order to analyse 65 originally written abstracts and 65 translated Kurdish abstracts. The aim of the study is to identify the translation competence of <b>medical</b> <b>experts</b> who perform English-Kurdish specialised medical translation. It also aims to identify any potential recurrent translational behaviour that occurs in Kurdish specialised medical translation. Moreover, the study aims to provide an insight into the status of Kurdish specialised language through examining the translated abstracts. The results of the data analysis reveal that <b>medical</b> <b>experts</b> have successfully demonstrated the translation of their research abstracts as far as terminology and conceptual knowledge are concerned. However, their translations show recurrent cases of linguistic and textual markedness which can be attributed to a lack of linguistic and textual competence. The results also revealed that Kurdish specialised medical language is not under-developed as the study hypothesised but it has a rich stock of specialised terminology as well as naturalised terms that the <b>medical</b> <b>experts</b> have largely used in their self-translated abstracts. Based on the outcomes of the study, it is concluded that <b>medical</b> <b>experts</b> require linguistic and textual competence as much as subject competence. In addition, consistent and appropriate proofreading can have a profound impact on specialised medical translation in reducing the incidence of syntactic and textual calques as well as common typographical errors before publication...|$|R
500|$|The closing {{arguments}} were heard on 9 and 10 November 2009.

This paper deals with segmentation of microscopy images of Langerhans islets and evaluation of islet parameters such as area, diameter, or volume (IE). For all the available images, the ground truth and the islet parameters were independently evaluated by four <b>medical</b> <b>experts.</b> We use a pixelwise linear classi er (perceptron algorithm) and SVM (support vector machine) for image segmentation. The volume is estimated based on circle or ellipse tting to individual islets. The segmentations were compared with the corresponding ground truth.

500|$|Garrow also {{influenced}} {{the rules of}} evidence, which were only just beginning to evolve when he started his career. His insistence that hearsay and copied documents could not be admitted in evidence led to the best evidence rule. He was crucial in insisting on the autonomy of lawyers when inducting evidence, in one case openly arguing with the trial judge {{to insist that the}} advocates have independence in submitting it. During this period, the use of partisan medical experts was particularly problematic. While medical experts were regularly called at the Old Bailey, the use of partisan experts was resisted, and at the beginning experts were given limited authority. While this increased {{towards the end of the}} 17th century, in line with the judges' increasing desire for certainty and facts, Garrow is noted as an excellent example of the attitude lawyers took when cross-examining such witnesses. When defending Robert Clark, accused of killing John Delew by kicking him in the stomach, Garrow used a mixture of aggressive cross-examination and medical knowledge to get the prosecution's <b>medical</b> <b>expert</b> to admit that he could not prove how Delew had died. Garrow and later advocates learned how to effectively [...] "interrogate" [...] such witnesses, strengthening their own arguments (when it was their expert) or demolishing those of others (when it was an expert attached to the other side).|$|E
500|$|The first {{allegations}} of systematic organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners {{were made in}} March 2006 by two individuals claiming to possess knowledge of involuntary organ extractions at the Sujiatun Thrombosis Hospital in Shenyang, Liaoning province. The allegations were publicized by the Epoch Times, a newspaper group founded by Falun Gong practitioners. Within one month of the press coverage, third party investigators, including representatives of the US Department of State, {{said that there was}} insufficient evidence to prove the allegations. In 2006 and 2008, United Nations Special Rapporteurs raised questions about the sources of organs, the short waiting times for finding perfectly matched organs, and the correlation between the sudden increase in organ transplants in China {{and the beginning of the}} persecution of Falun Gong practitioners. These requests were not satisfactorily addressed by the Chinese authorities. In November 2008 the United Nations Committee Against Torture noted its concern at the allegations and called for China to [...] "immediately conduct or commission an independent investigation of the claims", and take measures [...] "to ensure that those responsible for such abuses are prosecuted and punished".Chinese dissident Harry Wu, who exposed organ harvesting from prison inmates at laogai (hard labour camps), questioned the credibility of the Sujiatun whistle-blowers. But Harry Wu's July 2006 article showed his views in his March 21 letter were formed before completing his investigation, so Harry Wu's views were not based on his full investigation. Further, Harry Wu characterized the volume of organ harvesting Annie described as [...] "technically impossible", but in fact it is technically possible, according to <b>medical</b> <b>expert.</b> On April 14, 2006, the US state department wrote that [...] "U.S. representatives have found no evidence to support allegations that a site in northeast China has been used as a concentration camp to jail Falun Gong practitioners and harvest their organs", adding [...] "independent of these specific allegations, the United States remains concerned over China’s repression of Falun Gong practitioners and by reports of organ harvesting." ...|$|E
