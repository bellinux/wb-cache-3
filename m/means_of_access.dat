5|$|The Persian traveller, Nasir-i-Khusron, {{wrote of}} the exotic and {{beautiful}} wares in the Fustat markets: iridescent pottery, crystal, and many fruits and flowers, even during the winter months. From 975 to 1075, Fustat was a major production centre for Islamic art and ceramics, {{and one of the}} wealthiest cities in the world. One report stated that it paid taxes that were equivalent to US$150,000 per day, to the administration of Caliph Mo'ezz. Modern archaeological digs have turned up trade artefacts {{from as far away as}} Spain, China, and Vietnam. Excavations have also revealed intricate house and street plans; a basic unit consisted of rooms built around a central courtyard, with an arcade of arches on one side of the courtyard being the principal <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>access.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} rail lines. Antananarivo is {{connected}} to Toamasina, Ambatondrazaka and Antsirabe by rail, and another rail line connects Fianarantsoa to Manakara. The most important seaport in Madagascar {{is located on the}} east coast at Toamasina. Ports at Mahajanga and Antsiranana are significantly less used due to their remoteness. The island's newest port at Ehoala, constructed in 2008 and privately managed by Rio Tinto, will come under state control upon completion of the company's mining project near Tôlanaro around 2038. Air Madagascar services the island's many small regional airports, which offer the only practical <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to many of the more remote regions during rainy season road washouts.|$|E

25|$|Scores of {{military}} and commercial pilots, flying everything from small bush planes to four-engined turboprops, were {{the backbone of the}} operation. USAF LC-130 aircraft, operated by the 139th Airlift Squadron, provided a significant amount of airlift to sites like Dye 3 that were out on ice caps such as the ones in northern Greenland. C-124 Globemaster and C-119 Flying Boxcar transport planes also supported the project. Together, these provided the only <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to many of the stations during the wintertime. In all, 460,000 tons of materials were moved from the US and southern Canada to the Arctic by air, land, and sea.|$|E
25|$|In both {{town and}} country, <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> between {{the main house}} and the servant's wings were kept to a minimum, often the single door would be lined with green baize to deaden any sound. Long and {{complicated}} passages linking kitchens with dining rooms were devised; in some houses the tortuous route through corridors and staircases from kitchen to dining room could be an eighth of a mile – an absence of cooking smells taking priority over hot food. Even the doors linking to the connecting corridors would be covered by screens, sometimes disguised as bookcases with dummy books, or just simply covered in the same wallpaper as that with which the room was decorated, as the existence of servants {{was not to be}} acknowledged. Cleaning had to be performed {{in the early hours of}} the morning while the employers were asleep, and in the grander houses only male servants were allowed to be visible, and then only when required.|$|E
25|$|On 18 September 1965, {{the largest}} ever {{official}} crowd at the SCG, 78,056, saw St George defeat the South Sydney Rabbitohs 12–8 in the NSWRFL Grand Final. Gates were ordered to be closed {{two hours before the}} game began and children were allowed to sit inside the fence. Contemporary accounts indicate that many more – perhaps thousands – gained other <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> and sat on grandstand roofs or went into the Sydney Showground (Moore Park) and viewed the match from the stairways and roof of the main pavilion. Estimates from people there that day put the crowd as high as 90,000. This would stand as the largest rugby league crowd in Australia until Game 2 of the 1994 State of Origin series when 87,161 attended the game at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Due to the overcrowding of the ground during the Grand Final, the New South Wales Police Force imposed a 70,000 capacity limit on the Cricket Ground for safety reasons.|$|E

25|$|Echoing many of Ashby’s assertions in her 2007 paper {{entitled}} “Can Scottish {{public library}} services claim they are socially inclusive of all minority groups when lesbian fiction {{is still so}} inaccessible?”, Jaqueline Goldthorp outlines some of the challenges that lesbians face when trying to find lesbian fiction in Scottish libraries. She ties her study of lesbian literature {{to the importance of}} reading fiction on the psychological well-being of women, arguing that women often turn to fiction reading for self-affirmation and identity building. In addition, lesbian fiction titles can be priced up to 30% higher than non-lesbian titles, meaning that, for many low-income or working class lesbians, libraries are the only <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> for these titles Goldthorp surveyed 26 Scottish libraries and found that, in 2007, the majority had less than ten books labelled at “lesbian fiction,” and almost no recent award-winning titles. She suggests diversity training and education about methods and resources for providing service to lesbians for library staff as a way of promoting greater inclusion.|$|E
25|$|Holdgate Fee (or Holdgate's Fee) was a {{small part}} of the parish on the north side of the Teme which {{remained}} as a practical enclave (it continued the parish north across the river, but with no regular <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> without passing through Ludlow) within Ludlow's parish from c. 1200 (when Ludlow parish was formed) to 1901. Ludlow's parish was established upon land mostly from Stanton Lacy, but also with some from Ludford (which had extended in a north-east direction from the village, crossing the ford). Holdgate Fee was a rectangular plot of land located at the foot of Old Street, on the east side of the street, near the site of the former ford. The name came about as for a long period it was an estate in land (a fee) belonging to the manor of Steventon, which in turn was owned by the lordship of Castle Holdgate. Common with the other parts of Ludford's parish that lay north of the Teme, it belonged to Shropshire and the hundred of Culvestan, later Munslow.|$|E
25|$|Search engines such as Google {{serves as}} a default <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> to the Web and its wide array of {{linguistics}} resources. However, for linguists {{working in the field}} of corpora, there presents a number of challenges. This includes the limited instances that are presented by the search engines (1,000 or 5,000 maximum); insufficient context for each instance (Google provides a fragment of around ten words); results selected according to criteria that are distorted (from a linguistic point of view) as search term in titles and headings often occupy the top results slots; inability to allow searches to be specified according to linguistic criteria, such as the citation form for a word, or word class; unreliability of statistics, with results varying according to search engine load and many other factors. At present, in view of the conflicts of priorities among the different stakeholders, the best solution is for linguists to attempt to correct these problems by themselves. This will then lead to a large number of possibilities opening in the area of harnessing the rich potential of the Web.|$|E

500|$|The second exit {{program was}} also {{included}} in station modernization projects after a fire safety audit revealed several at-risk stations with only one <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>access</b> and egress from the subway platform level to the street.

Other stations such as [...] and [...] are scheduled to receive second exits for egress only. Due to the potential for land expropriation and construction of the exit structures in residential neighbourhoods, {{this portion of the}} program has become controversial, as some houses need to be removed to accommodate these secondary exits. However, plans to add a second exit for Donlands, Greenwood, and Woodbine stations have been deferred since late February 2011, due to lack of funding.|$|E
500|$|The Yangtze River in {{the area}} of Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan provinces) was key to the success of this strategy.

The fidelity to this close fund doesn’t mean obedience to the wishes/desires, because it demands rational analysis and respect for the core values of the society...|$|R

2500|$|Because {{the pilot}} was above the {{extension}} shaft, he was placed higher in the fuselage than in most contemporary fighters, which, in turn gave the pilot a good field of view.
