5000|$|The <b>MADS</b> <b>box</b> is a conserved {{sequence}} motif. The genes which contain this motif {{are called the}} MADS-box gene family. The <b>MADS</b> <b>box</b> encodes the DNA-binding MADS domain. The MADS domain binds to DNA sequences of high similarity to the motif CCA/T6GG termed the CArG-box. MADS-domain proteins are generally transcription factors. [...] The length of the MADS-box reported by various researchers varies somewhat, but typical lengths {{are in the range}} of 168 to 180 base pairs, i.e. the encoded MADS domain has a length of 56 to 60 amino acids.

In this study, plant <b>MADS</b> <b>box</b> transcription factor interactions identified by yeast two-hybrid systems where studied in living plant cells by a technique based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Petunia <b>MADS</b> <b>box</b> proteins were fused to either cyan fluorescent protein or yellow fluorescent protein and transiently expressed in protoplasts followed by FRET-spectral imaging microscopy and FRET-fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy to detect FRET and hence protein-protein interactions. All petunia <b>MADS</b> <b>box</b> heterodimers identified in yeast were confirmed in protoplasts. However, in contrast to the yeast two-hybrid results, homodimerization was demonstrated in plant cells for three petunia <b>MADS</b> <b>box</b> proteins. Heterodimers were identified between the ovule-specific <b>MADS</b> <b>box</b> protein FLORAL BINDING PROTEIN 11 and members of the petunia FLORAL BINDING PROTEIN 2 subfamily, which are also expressed in ovules, suggesting that these dimers play a role in ovule development.

40|$|Most known floral {{homeotic}} genes {{belong to the}} <b>MADS</b> <b>box</b> family and their products act in combination to specify floral organ identity by an unknown mechanism. We have used a yeast two-hybrid system to investigate the network of interactions between the Antirrhinum organ identity gene products. Selective heterodimerization is observed between <b>MADS</b> <b>box</b> factors. Exclusive interactions are detected between two factors, DEFICIENS (DEF) and GLOBOSA (GLO), previously known to heterodimerize and control development of petals and stamens. In contrast, a third factor, PLENA (PLE), which is required for reproductive organ development, can interact with the products of <b>MADS</b> <b>box</b> genes expressed at early, intermediate and late stages. We also demonstrate that heterodimerization of DEF and GLO requires the K box, a domain not found in non-plant <b>MADS</b> <b>box</b> factors, indicating that the plant <b>MADS</b> <b>box</b> factors may have different criteria for interaction. The association of PLENA and the temporally intermediate <b>MADS</b> <b>box</b> factors suggests that part of their function in mediating between the meristem and organ identity genes is accomplished through direct interaction.

40|$|Regulation of {{flowering}} time is best {{understood in the}} dicot model species Arabidopsis thaliana. Molecular analyses revealed that genes belonging to the <b>MADS</b> <b>box</b> transcription factor family play pivotal regulatory roles in both the vernalization- and photoperiod-regulated flowering pathways. Here the analysis of three APETALA 1 (AP 1) -like <b>MADS</b> <b>box</b> proteins (LpMADS 1 ¿ 3) and a SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) -like <b>MADS</b> <b>box</b> protein (LpMADS 10) from the monocot perennial grass species Lolium perenne is reported. Features of these <b>MADS</b> <b>box</b> proteins were studied by yeast two-hybrid assays. Protein¿protein interactions among the Lolium proteins and {{with members of the}} Arabidopsis <b>MADS</b> <b>box</b> family have been studied. The expression pattern for LpMADS 1 and the protein properties suggest that not the Arabidopsis AP 1 gene, but the SUPPRESSOR OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC 1) gene, is the functional equivalent of LpMADS 1. To obtain insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of LpMADS 1 gene expression in vernalization-sensitive and -insensitive Lolium accessions, the upstream sequences of this gene from a winter and spring growth habit variety were compared with respect to <b>MADS</b> <b>box</b> protein binding. In both promoter elements, a putative <b>MADS</b> <b>box</b> transcription factor-binding site (CArG-box) is present; however, the putative spring promoter has a short deletion adjacent to this DNA motif.

These proteins are labeled for destruction by an ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E 3) known as the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C). The APC/C requires activators (Cdc 20 or Cdh 1) to efficiently recognize its substrates, which are specified by destruction (D box) and/or KEN box signals. The spindle assembly checkpoint responds to unattached kinetochores and to kinetochores lacking tension, both of which reflect incomplete biorientation of chromosomes, by delaying the onset of anaphase. It does this by inhibiting Cdc 20 -APC/C. Certain checkpoint proteins interact directly with Cdc 20, but it remains unclear how the checkpoint acts to efficiently inhibit Cdc 20 -APC/C activity. In the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, {{we find that the}} Mad 3 and Mad 2 spindle checkpoint proteins interact stably with the APC/C in mitosis. Mad 3 contains two KEN boxes, conserved from yeast Mad 3 to human BubR 1, and mutation of either of these abrogates the spindle checkpoint.

To determine which amino acids define the specificity of Arg 80, we swapped the amino acids in each secondary-structure element of the Arg 80 <b>MADS</b> <b>box</b> domain with the corresponding amino acids of Mcm 1 and assayed the ability of these chimeras to regulate arginine-metabolic genes in place of the wild-type Arg 80.

We show that multiple regions of Arg 80 are important for its function. Interestingly, the residues which have important roles in determining the specificity of Arg 80 are not those which could contact the DNA but are residues that are likely to be involved in protein interactions. Many of these residues are clustered on one side of the protein, which could serve as an interface for interaction with Arg 81 or Mcm 1.

In core eudicots, the B class genes belong to two paralogous lineages whose products form obligate heterodimers.

In this study a large-scale yeast three-hybrid screen is utilized to {{provide insight into the}} higher-order complex formation capacity of the Arabidopsis <b>MADS</b> <b>box</b> family. SEPALLATA 3 (SEP 3) has been shown to mediate complex formation and, therefore, special attention is paid to this factor in this study. Results - In total, 106 multimeric complexes were identified; in more than half of these at least one SEP protein was present. Besides the known complexes involved in determining floral organ identity, various complexes consisting of combinations of proteins known {{to play a role in}} floral organ identity specification, and flowering time determination were discovered. The capacity to form this latter type of complex suggests that homeotic factors play essential roles in down-regulation of the <b>MADS</b> <b>box</b> genes involved in floral timing in the flower via negative auto-regulatory loops. Furthermore, various novel complexes were identified that may be important for the direct regulation of the floral transition process. A subsequent detailed analysis of the APETALA 3, PISTILLATA, and SEP 3 proteins in living plant cells suggests the formation of a multimeric complex in vivo. Conclusions - Overall, these results provide strong indications that higher-order complex formation is a general and essential molecular mechanism for plant <b>MADS</b> <b>box</b> protein functioning and attribute a pivotal role to the SEP 3 'glue' protein in mediating multimerizatio...|$|E
40|$|<b>MADS</b> <b>box</b> {{transcription}} factors controlling flower {{development have}} been isolated and studied {{in a wide}} variety of organisms. These studies have shown that homologous <b>MADS</b> <b>box</b> genes from different species often have similar functions. OsAMDS 18 from rice (Oryza sativa) belongs to the phylogenetically defined AP 1 /SQUA group. The <b>MADS</b> <b>box</b> genes of this group have functions in plant development, like controlling the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth, determination of floral organ identity, and regulation of fruit maturation. In this paper we report the functional analysis of OsMADS 18. This rice <b>MADS</b> <b>box</b> gene is widely expressed in rice with its transcripts accumulated to higher levels in meristems. Overexpression of OsMADS 18 in rice induced early flowering, and detailed histological analysis revealed that the formation of axillary shoot meristems was accelerated. Silencing of OsAMDS 18 using an RNA interference approach did not result in any visible phenotypic alteration, indicating that OsMADS 18 is probably redundant with other <b>MADS</b> <b>box</b> transcription factors. Surprisingly, overexpression of OsMADS 18 in Arabidopsis caused a phenotype closely resembling the ap 1 mutant. We show that the ap 1 phenotype is not caused by down-regulation of AP 1 expression. Yeast two-hybrid experiments showed that some of the natural partners of AP 1 interact with OsMADS 18, suggesting that the OsAMDS 18 overexpression phenotype in Arabidopsis is likely to be due to the subtraction of AP 1 partners from active transcription complexes. Thus, when compared to AP 1, OsMADS 18 during evolution seems to have conserved the mechanistic properties of protein-protein interactions, although it cannot complement the AP 1 function...|$|E
40|$|We {{isolated}} and characterized two ovule-specific <b>MADS</b> <b>box</b> cDNAs from petunia, designated floral binding protein (fbp) genes 7 and 11. The putative protein products of these genes have approximately 90 % of their overall {{amino acid sequence}} in common. In situ RNA hybridization experiments revealed that both genes are expressed {{in the center of}} the developing gynoecium before ovule primordia are visible. At later developmental stages, hybridization signals were observed only in the ovules, suggesting that these genes are involved in ovule formation. To test this hypothesis, we raised transgenic petunia plants in which both fbp 7 and fbp 11 expression was inhibited by cosuppression. In the ovary of these transformants, spaghetti-shaped structures developed in positions normally occupied by ovules. These abnormal structures morphologically and functionally resemble style and stigma tissues. Our results show that these <b>MADS</b> <b>box</b> genes belong to a new class of <b>MADS</b> <b>box</b> genes involved in proper ovule development in petunia...|$|E
