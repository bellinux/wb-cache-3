Patients with the syndrome are more likely than the general population to have genetic disorders, and about a third of people with the syndrome encountered some form of birth difficulty. In a study of 186 older patients, about ten percent had preexisting psychiatric issues. One study found that about ten percent of patients had a neurological condition before KLS developed. The condition does not appear to occur most frequently in one season.|$|E

Similarly, Dodge and colleagues conducted a study on a sample of school-aged children between 3rd–5th grade and found that children who were rejected were <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> other children to exhibit hostile attributions of intent to ambiguous social situations (e.g., when a behavior could have been either accidental or intentional). Furthermore, Dodge and colleagues found that children with high hostile attribution bias then went on to exhibit the most aggressive behaviors later on.|$|E

2500|$|There was {{a gender}} gap in {{perceptions}} to the case. According to a USA Today/Gallup Poll of 1,010 respondents, {{about two-thirds of}} Americans (64 percent) believed Casey Anthony [...] "definitely" [...] or [...] "probably" [...] murdered her daughter; however, women were <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> men to believe the murder charges against Anthony and to be upset by the not-guilty verdict. The poll reported that women were {{more than twice as}} likely as men, 28 percent versus 11 percent, to think Anthony [...] "definitely" [...] committed murder. Twenty-seven percent of women said they were angry about the verdict, compared with nine percent of men. On the day Casey Anthony was sentenced for lying to investigators in the death of her daughter, supporters and protesters gathered outside the Orange County Courthouse, with one man who displayed a sign asking Anthony to marry him. Two men who drove overnight from West Virginia held signs that said, [...] "We love and support you Casey Anthony," [...] and [...] "Nancy Grace, stop trying to ruin innocent lives. The jury has spoken. P.S. Our legal system still works!" [...] The gender gap has partly been explained by [...] "the maternal instinct". The idea of a mother murdering her own child is a threat to the ideal of motherhood. For example, the trial was compared to the 1960s trial of Alice Crimmins, who was accused of murdering her two small children.|$|E

60|$|That (as D’Alembert says) if the {{succession}} of sixes was actually thrown before our eyes, we should ascribe it not to chance, but to unfairness in the dice, is unquestionably true. But this arises from a totally different principle. We should then be considering, not the probability of the fact in itself, but the comparative probability with which, when it {{is known to have}} happened, it may be referred to one or to another cause. The regular series is not at all less likely than the irregular one to be brought about by chance, but it is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> the irregular one to be produced by design; or by some general cause operating through the structure of the dice. It is the nature of casual combinations to produce a repetition of the same event, as often and no oftener than any other series of events. But it is the nature of general causes to reproduce, in the same circumstances, always the same event. Common sense and science alike dictate that, all other things being the same, we should rather attribute the effect to a cause which if real would be very likely to produce it, than to a cause which would be very unlikely to produce it. According to Laplace’s sixth theorem, which we demonstrated in a former chapter, the difference of probability arising from the superior efficacy of the constant cause, unfairness in the dice, would after a very few throws far outweigh any antecedent probability which there could be against its existence.|$|E

Failure to account for the role of older fish may help explain recent collapses of some major US West Coast fisheries. Recovery of some stocks is expected to take decades.

40|$|CT is an {{important}} modality for imaging mediastinal masses, and certain CT attenuation features (fat, calcium, or water attenuation, contrast enhancement) are well known to suggest specific diagnoses. In a series of 132 consecutive patients with tissue-proven mediastinal masses, these specific CT features were present in only 16. We evaluated the ability of CT to differentiate soft tissue mediastinal masses based on morphology and distribution of disease. Metastatic disease and lymphoma accounted for 69 % of masses in this series, and CT could not generally differentiate them. However, CT was helpful in differential diagnosis in certain settings. CT demonstration of multiple mediastinal masses when conventional radiographs showed a single mass generally excluded diagnoses such as thymoma and teratoma. CT demonstration of a single middle mediastinal mass, frequently missed by conventional radiography, made metastatic disease a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> diagnosis <b>than</b> lymphoma. Finally, CT demonstration of certain ancillary findings strongly favored a diagnosis of lymphoma (axillary adenopathy) or metastatic disease (solitary pulmonary mass, focal liver lesions, bone lesions) ...|$|R
