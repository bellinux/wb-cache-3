40|$|To {{increase}} efficiencies, clothing retailers often outsource {{the manufacturing}} of products to traders. Traders pass on these time and cost pressures to outworkers who reportedly work in poor and unsafe working conditions. This article analyses whether existing occupational {{health and safety}} laws require <b>retailers</b> <b>to</b> take steps to manage outworkers’ labour conditions. First, the article considers how deemed employment laws which require traders to manage outworkers’ workplace safety may be able to be extended up supply chains to impose duties over retailers. Secondly, the article examines how employers’ OHS duties for non-employees may create OHS duties for <b>retailers</b> <b>to</b> ensure outworkers’ safety. It appears that imposing OHS duties across several corporate relationships and across geographical locations may diminish the capacity of <b>retailers</b> <b>to</b> manage outworkers. Thirdly, the article demonstrates how OHS duties only require parties to take all reasonably practicable steps to ensure safety. Finally, the article analyses the capacity of <b>retailers</b> <b>to</b> utilise hold harmless clauses to avoid OHS duties...|$|R

Both groups experienced amygdala activation in response <b>to</b> <b>EST.</b> Male control groups (gynephilic) experienced hypothalamic activation in response <b>to</b> <b>EST.</b> However, the MtF subjects also experienced limited hypothalamic activation <b>to</b> <b>EST.</b> The researchers concluded that in terms of pheromone activation, MtFs occupy an intermediate position with predominantly female features. The MtF transsexual subjects had not undergone any hormonal treatment {{at the time of the}} study, according to their own declaration beforehand, and confirmed by repeated tests of hormonal levels.|$|R
