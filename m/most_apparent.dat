5|$|However, {{over the}} Northern Hemisphere land areas where urban heat islands are <b>most</b> <b>apparent,</b> both the trends of lower-tropospheric {{temperature}} and surface air temperature show no significant differences. In fact, the lower-tropospheric temperatures warm at a slightly greater rate over North America (about 0.28°C/decade using satellite data) {{than do the}} surface temperatures (0.27°C/decade), although again the difference is not statistically significant.|$|E
5|$|While domesticated rats are not removed {{enough from}} their wild {{counterparts}} {{to justify a}} distinct subspecies (compare Canis lupus familiaris), there are significant differences that set them apart; the <b>most</b> <b>apparent</b> is coloring. Random color mutations may occur in the wild, but these are rare. Most wild R. norvegicus are a dark brown color, while fancy rats may be anything from white to cinnamon to blue.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, {{during the}} Antarctic summer when {{phytoplankton}} bloom was apparent, {{the lake was}} studied, along with several others in the Vestfold Hills area to assess the reduced sulfuric gases by gas chromatography. The gases were trapped in a solid adsorbent – a molecular sieve with 5 Å pores (80–100 mesh) – and reduced sulfur compounds (RSCs) were detected. The <b>most</b> <b>apparent</b> RSCs were dimethyl sulfide (DMS), carbonyl sulfide and hydrogen sulfide.|$|E
2500|$|Calculation {{showed that}} {{if there had been}} any appreciable motion due to parallax, then the star should have reached its <b>most</b> southerly <b>apparent</b> {{position}} in December, and its <b>most</b> northerly <b>apparent</b> position in June. [...] What Bradley found instead was an apparent motion that reached its most southerly point in March, and its most northerly point in September; and that could not be accounted for by parallax: the cause of a motion with the pattern actually seen was at first obscure.|$|R
50|$|<b>Most</b> {{clinically}} <b>apparent</b> miscarriages (two-thirds to three-quarters {{in various}} studies) occur {{during the first}} trimester. About 30% to 40% of all fertilized eggs miscarry, often before the pregnancy is known. The embryo typically dies before the pregnancy is expelled; bleeding into the decidua basalis and tissue necrosis causes uterine contractions to expel the pregnancy.|$|R

5|$|The flora of {{the island}} is {{relatively}} untouched {{with a large number}} of rare plants, 44% being endemic to the island. With a diversity of conditions ranging from valleys, to ridges, plains and misty mountain tops there is habitat {{for a wide range of}} plant communities which have been comprehensively analysed and mapped. There are 57 species of fern of which 25 are endemic: they are most abundant in the moist environments of the southern island, especially the higher parts of Mount Gower, perhaps the <b>most</b> <b>apparent</b> being the four endemic tree ferns in the genus Cyathea that occur on the southern mountains.|$|E
5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>apparent</b> {{lava flows}} at a {{seamount}} are the eruptive flows that cover their flanks, however igneous intrusions, in {{the forms of}} dikes and sills, are also {{an important part of}} seamount growth. The most common type of flow is pillow lava, named so after its distinctive shape. Less common are sheet flows, which are glassy and marginal, and indicative of larger-scale flows. Volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks dominate shallow-water seamounts. They are the products of the explosive activity of seamounts that are near the water's surface, and can also form from mechanical wear of existing volcanic rock.|$|E
5|$|Early modern Europe saw the {{emergence}} {{for the first}} time of a distinctive elite culture: while the Reformation encouraged new skepticism and opposition to traditional beliefs, subsequent Romanticism encouraged the fetishisation of such beliefs by intellectual elites. The effects of this on writing about elves are <b>most</b> <b>apparent</b> in England and Germany, with developments in each country influencing the other. In Scandinavia, the Romantic movement was also prominent, and literary writing was the main context for continued use of the word elf, except in fossilised words for illnesses. However, oral traditions about beings like elves remained prominent in Scandinavia into the early twentieth century.|$|E

Later he focused on application of his new stylistic inventions and ideas. The most valued compositions from this period are the Quintet for Flute, Oboe, Clarinet, Bassoon and Piano and the Symphony in One Movement.|$|R
50|$|The <b>most</b> readily <b>apparent</b> form of {{collection}} {{can be observed}} when comparing different degrees {{of collection}} within a single gait. A more collected gait will have two main symptoms: the horse will lower his hindquarters and raise his forehand, and the horse will have more bend in the joints of his legs. Additionally, the stride length will be shortened. Collection may be performed at any gait.|$|R
5000|$|The song is {{remarkable}} {{for a number}} of reasons. Perhaps the <b>most</b> readily <b>apparent</b> is that it was the first occasion that a song not in a natural language had been performed at the Eurovision Song Contest (prompting the famous remark of BBC commentator Terry Wogan [...] "They've got 4 languages in Belgium and they're singing in an imaginary one, the very essence of the Euro").|$|R
5|$|Marx's {{thoughts}} on labour {{were related to}} the primacy he gave to the economic relation in determining the society's past, present and future (see also economic determinism). Accumulation of capital shapes the social system. For Marx, social change was about conflict between opposing interests, driven in the background by economic forces. This became the inspiration for the body of works known as the conflict theory. In his evolutionary model of history, he argued that human history began with free, productive and creative work that was over time coerced and dehumanised, a trend <b>most</b> <b>apparent</b> under capitalism. Marx noted that this was not an intentional process, rather no individual or even state can go against the forces of economy.|$|E
5|$|R.S. Yeoman's 2014 {{edition of}} A Guide Book of United States Coins lists the Lafayette dollar at $650 in Almost Uncirculated (AU-50) ranging upwards to $19,000 in near-pristine MS-66. One in MS-67 condition, tied with {{multiple}} others {{for the best}} condition known, sold in 2004 for $66,700. Most Lafayette dollars display contact marks from other coins as the pieces were mechanically ejected from the press into a hopper and no {{attempt was made to}} preserve their appearance for collectors. Although whether the specimen is well-struck or not rarely affects value, clearly struck specimens will show the engraving line separating Lafayette's boot from the rest of his uniform, and details of the lower part of his clothing will also be distinct. The highest points on the coin, at which wear should be <b>most</b> <b>apparent,</b> are Washington's cheekbone on the obverse and the face of Lafayette on the reverse.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of the Vietnamese support the CPP, and those who carry Cambodian citizenship would vote for the party. Vietnamese support for the CPP has mostly driven by strong anti-Vietnamese sentiments from other political parties. Although many members within the rank and file of the CPP share anti-Vietnamese sentiments with other political parties, the CPP maintained an openly neutral stance towards the Vietnamese community. According to Ehrentraut, the CPP's neutral stance was a balance between not providing open support for the Vietnamese community, which would have the potential effect of losing electoral votes to other political parties, {{while at the same time}} maintaining close ties with the Vietnamese government which the CPP had historical ties dating back to 1979. Vietnamese who hold Cambodian citizenship have also expressed fear over physical insecurity during election periods, which is <b>most</b> <b>apparent</b> during the 1993 and 2013 elections when Vietnamese civilians faced physical intimidation from the Khmer Rouge and CNRP supporters respectively and have abstained from participating in elections.|$|E

500|$|The novel's title can be {{attributed}} to a number of aspects of the work. The purification of the cemetery and the recent change in social mores (in relation to dirt and decay) being the <b>most</b> immediately <b>apparent.</b> James Kidd, writing for The Independent, stated [...] "if this suggests one definition of purity, others are suggested by political undercurrents. Namely, the ideals that helped shape the French Revolution: Voltaire's call to reason, Rousseau's call to equality, and Robespierre's call to arms." ...|$|R
5|$|Throughout {{his career}} von Stroheim used {{grotesque}} imagery and characters. This is <b>most</b> <b>apparent</b> in the wedding-banquet scene, {{which includes a}} midget, a hunchback, a woman with buck teeth and a boy on crutches. The wedding guests violently and crudely devour their meal like animals. This scene was unlike any other in films of that period, which treated meals with dignity {{and a sense of}} communion. Other instances of grotesque imagery include Trina's fingers becoming infected and amputated. Von Stroheim contrasted love scenes between McTeague and Trina with their ugly, lower-class environment, such as the sewer with the dead rat and a garbage truck driving by as they kiss.|$|E

The <b>most</b> immediately <b>apparent</b> {{difference is}} the rather stubby short tender that was specially built to allow the 59 class to be turned on standard 60 ft turntables. It was the specification of these tenders which considerably delayed the delivery from initial order. Unfortunately due to {{the weight of the}} locomotive it was eventually discovered in service that most 60 ft turntables could not turn the 59 class due to balancing issues.|$|R

Dysmorphology is the study of dysmorphic features, their origins and proper nomenclature. One of the key challenges in identifying and describing dysmorphic features is the use and understanding of specific terms between different individuals.
