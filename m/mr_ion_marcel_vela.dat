25|$|During Macedonski's absence, {{his style}} and work {{had come to}} be {{reviewed}} more positively, in particular by the young authors I. Dragoslav, Horia Furtună, Ion Pillat, Anastasie Mândru, Al. T. Stamatiad, as well as by post-Junimist critic Mihail Dragomirescu, who offered Macedonski a good reception in his Convorbiri Critice magazine. Tudor Vianu, who cites contemporary statements by Dragoslav, concludes that, upon arrival, Macedonski was enthusiastically received by a public who had missed him. Also in 1912, one of his poems was published as an homage by Simbolul, a magazine published by the young and radical Symbolists Tristan Tzara, <b>Ion</b> Vinea and <b>Marcel</b> Janco. Around that time, Macedonski also collaborated with the Iași-based moderate Symbolist magazine Versuri și Proză. Polemics surrounding his case nevertheless continued: in late 1912, as part of a National Theater adaptation of Alphonse Daudet's Sapho, actor Cazimir Belcot borrowed from Macedonski's appearance and mannerisms to portray a failure.|$|R

2500|$|The {{mixture of}} themes and the controversies {{surrounding}} Gândirist politics have also touched Sion's artistic contributions. In the 1920s, the artistic vision proposed by Sion and Ressu was being contested by the avant-garde school of Contimporanul. Also inspired by primitive art, its leaders <b>Ion</b> Vinea and <b>Marcel</b> Janco refused {{to view the}} others as actual exponents of peasant traditions. The more radical experimenters, including Sion's student Jacques Hérold, rejected tame modernism altogether, turning to Surrealism; but young neo-traditionalists such as Elena Popea found in it a source of inspiration. Retrospectively, philosopher and curator Erwin Kessler finds in Sion the exponent of [...] "a reactionary Romanian modernism": artistic nationalism, coming {{at a time when}} all modern Romanian art was divided along ethnic lines ("the ethnic component of classical modernism played an important role, one that should be explained, not occulted"). Kessler additionally notes that there is a radical component to Sion's belief in the organic relationship of men and the soil, likening it to the main concepts of Romanian nationalism and traditionalism—from A. C. Cuza's antisemitism to Virgil Madgearu's agrarianism, and passing through Blaga's theory on folk architecture. Also an antisemite, Crainic contended that Sion's art never made an impression on the art market, since the buyers were [...] "mostly Jewish".|$|R
40|$|Magnetoresistance (<b>MR)</b> of <b>ion</b> {{irradiated}} monolayer graphene samples with variable-range hopping (VRH) {{mechanism of}} conductivity was measured at temperatures down to T = 1. 8 K in magnetic fields up to B = 8 T. It was observed that in perpendicular magnetic fields, hopping resistivity R decreases, which corresponds to negative MR (NMR), while parallel magnetic field results in positive MR (PMR) at low temperatures. NMR is explained {{on the basis}} of the "orbital" model in which perpendicular magnetic field suppresses the destructive interference of many paths through the intermediate sites in the total probability of the long-distance tunneling in the VRH regime. At low fields, a quadratic dependence (|Δ R/R|∼ B^ 2) of NMR is observed, while at B > B^*, the quadratic dependence is replaced by the linear one. It was found that all NMR curves for different samples and different temperatures could be merged into common dependence when plotted as a function of B/B^*. It is shown that B^*∼ T^ 1 / 2 in agreement with predictions of the "orbital" model. The obtained values of B^* allowed also to estimate the localization radius ξ of charge carriers for samples with different degree of disorder. PMR in parallel magnetic fields is explained by suppression of hopping transitions via double occupied states due to alignment of electron spins. Comment: 14 pages, 9 figures.

40|$|Dried varnish {{is rich in}} many ester moieties, {{which may}} {{be broken down into}} small, soluble {{compounds}} by esterase activity or alkaline hydrolysis. Two methods for varnish removal have been developed, including the treatment of either lipase or RbOH / PEG- 400 crown ether which allow aged oil varnishes or paint coverings to be removed or thinned. These techniques are designed to proceed in a controlled manner without damaging lower paint or base layers. Unfortunately, lipase did not react with the aged ester groups of dried linseed oil varnish. Surprisingly, the varnish came off in the presence of Tris buffer alone which, in addition, formed reactive metal complexes. A better choice was the use of high <b>Mr</b> alkali <b>ion</b> polyethylene glycol– 400 (PEG- 400) crown ether type chelates. PEG- 400 complexes alkali ions including rubidium and other alkaliions impeding the diffusion of their basic counter ions into lower varnish or paint layers. Possible migration of alkali metal ions into the paint layer during alkaline varnish removal was determined by labelling the cleansing solutions with 86 Rb. Fortunately, varnish is degraded on the surface only. Lower paint or varnish layers are not attacked even if chemically similar to the varnish or over painting to be removed as virtually no 86 Rb was detected on the paint surface...|$|R
2500|$|Before {{and during}} World War I, Sămănătorism (like Poporanism) became a {{favorite}} target of ridicule {{for the young}} modernist or avant-garde writers and artists. In Sandqvist's opinion, this answered to [...] "a certain exclusivism" [...] of the two established currents, which, he notes, only served to provoke [...] "an avant-garde reaction." [...] One of the first avant-garde magazines to host articles specifically aiming the traditionalist currents was Simbolul, published by Tristan Tzara, <b>Ion</b> Vinea and <b>Marcel</b> Janco in 1912. Vinea in particular followed up with attacks on the Sămănătorist legacy by means of other publications, primarily Facla and Chemarea, while his colleague in Iași, dramatist and future critic Benjamin Fondane, vocally rejected Sămănătorists and Poporanists as [...] "talentless writers" [...] destined to be [...] "forgotten". According to Dan Grigorescu, Sămănătorul magazine and its affiliates had a paradoxical role as a [...] "catalyst" [...] for Expressionism, which manifested itself in Romanian art beginning in the 1910s, and which contemplated urban life as a tragic experience: [...] "However odd it may seem, Sămănătorism created a favorable atmosphere for ideas akin to those which {{would lead to the}} revelation of Expressionist attitudes in the Occident." [...] Some former Sămănătorists migrated toward Symbolist or post-Symbolist publications, as in the cases of traditionalist-inspired prose writers I. Dragoslav (who began collaborating with Insula, a magazine published by Minulescu in 1912) and Gala Galaction (who joined poet Tudor Arghezi and socialist journalist N. D. Cocea in editing a succession of leftist and modernist reviews).|$|R
50|$|The sixth season opened August 30, 1852 with The Hunchback, {{in which}} Julia Dean made her first {{appearance}} at this theater. Collins arrived for two weeks, {{one of them}} with the Bateman Children in The Young Couple and The Spoiled Child. Forrest began five weeks on September 20, followed by Mr. and Mrs. Barney Williams for one week. November 1, Ingomar, the Barbarian with Dean and Conway. November 8, The Duke's Wager, by Mrs. Kemble Butler, with Dean, Ponisi, and Conway. November 15, a new petite drama by the Brothers Mayhew, with the Bateman Children and their father. November 29, Mrs. Mowatt for two weeks, who played Parthenia in Ingomar, Blanche in her play Armand, Rosalind, <b>Mrs.</b> Haller, <b>Ion,</b> and Martha Gibbs, and the title character in Anne Blake, the Poor Dependent, by John Westland Marston. Nine weeks of opera began December 13, 1852, with {{the world premiere of}} the opera The Peri with words by S. J. Burr and music by James Gaspard Maeder (1809-1876), featuring Mr. Bishop, Caroline Richings, Ponisi, and Davidge. It was performed twelve times. December 27, La Cenerentola with Marietta Alboni performing {{for the first time in}} New York City, supported by Signors Sangiovanni, Rovere, and Barili. Alboni appeared as Norma, Amina, Rosina, and Marie in Child of the Regiment, through January 28, 1853. February 14 for the first time in America, Jerrold's comedy St. Cupid was presented. February 24, Forrest acted Othello. His engagement was interrupted by illness, and on the 28th, The White Slave of England was produced, with Ponisi, Conway, Barry, and Mrs. Vernon. March 7, Forrest resumed, as Jack Cade. April 26, a new comedietta by Charles Mathews (the younger) called Little Toddlekins was given, with Davidge and Mrs. Vernon. On May 2 a new and lavish production of Macbeth opened, with Forrest, Conway, and Ponisi; it played 20 nights. The season closed July 18, 1853. The summer season by the Williamses (July 4 - August 6) was very successful.|$|R
40|$|The Neutralized Transport Experiment (NTX) {{has been}} built at the Heavy Ion Fusion Virtual National Laboratory. NTX is the first {{successful}} integrated beam system experiment that explores various physical phenomena, and determines the final spot size of a high intensity ion beam on a scaled version of a Heavy Ion Fusion driver. The final spot size {{is determined by the}} conditions of the beam produced in the injector, the beam dynamics in the focusing lattice, and the plasma neutralization dynamics in the final transport. A high brightness ion source using an aperturing technique delivers 25 mA of single charged potassium ion beam at 300 keV and a normalized edge emittance of 0. 05 r-mm-mr. The ion beam is injected into a large bore magnetic quadrupole lattice, which produces a 20 mm radius beam converging at 20 <b>mr.</b> The converging <b>ion</b> beam is further injected into a plasma neutralization drift section where it is compressed ballistically down to a 1 mm spot size. (cont.) NTX provides the first experimental proof of plasma neutralized ballistic transport of a space-charge dominated ion beam, the information about higher order aberration effects on the spot size, the validation of numerical tools based on excellent agreement between measurements and numerical simulations over a broad parameter regime, and the development of new diagnostics to study the ion beam dynamics. The theoretical and experimental results are presented on the beam dynamics in the ion diode, downstream quadrupole lattice, and final neutralized transport. by Enrique Henestroza. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The {{synthesis}} and {{characterization of}} ferrofluid based MR contrast agents, which offer R 2 * versatility {{beyond that of}} ferucarbotran, is described. Ferrofluids were formed after stabilizing magnetite cores with dodecanoic acid (a), oleic acid (b), dodecylamine (c), citric acid (d) or tartaric acid (e). Core sizes were deduced from TEM micrographs. Magnetic properties were determined by SQUID magnetometry. Hydrodynamic particle diameters were determined by dynamic light scattering measurements. Zeta potentials were measured by combining laser Doppler velocimetry and phase analysis light scattering. Iron contents were evaluated colorimetrically. MR relaxometry including R 1 and R 2 * was conducted in vitro using homogeneous ferrofluid samples. The average core diameters of ferrofluids a, b and c equaled 9. 4 +/- 2. 8 nm and approximately 2 nm for ferrofluids d and e. Magnetization measurements at 300 K revealed superparamagnetic behaviour for the dried 9 nm diameter cores and paramagnetic-like behaviour for the dried cores of ferrofluids d and e. Iron contents were between 32 - 75 mg Fe/mL, reflecting the ferrofluids' high particle concentrations. Hydrodynamic particle diameters equaled 100 - 120 nm (a, b and c). For the ferrofluids a, b, d and e coated with anions, strong negative zeta potential values between - 27. 5 mV and - 54. 0 mV were determined and a positive zeta potential value of + 33. 5 mV was found for ferrofluid c, covered with cationic dodecylammonium <b>ions.</b> <b>MR</b> relaxometry yielded R 1 -values of 1. 9 +/- 0. 3 (a), 4. 0 +/- 0. 8 (b), 5. 2 +/- 1. 0 (c), 0. 124 +/- 0. 002 (d) and 0. 092 +/- 0. 005 s(- 1) mM(- 1) (e), and R 2 *-values of 856 +/- 24 (a), 729 +/- 16 (b), 922 +/- 29 (c), 1. 7 +/- 0. 05 (d) and 0. 49 +/- 0. 05 s(- 1) mM(- 1) (e). Thus, the synthesized ferrofluids reveal {{a broad spectrum of}} R 2 * relaxivities. As a result, the various MR contrast agents have a great potential to be used in studies dealing with malignant tissue targeting or molecular imaging. status: publishe...|$|R
