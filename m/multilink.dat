Suspension is double wishbone or <b>multilink</b> front and rear, with pushrod operated springs and dampers on the chassis – one exception being that of the 2009 specification Red Bull Racing car (RB5) which used pullrod suspension at the rear, the first car to do so since the Minardi PS01 in 2001.

The considered dynamical networks with <b>multilinks</b> contain only one transmittal time-varying delay for each subnetwork, which makes us get hold of more interesting and practical points. Two kinds of delay-dependent feedback controllers with <b>multilinks</b> as well as appropriate Lyapunov functions are defined to achieve the goal of fixed-time synchronization and finite-time synchronization for the networks. Some novel and effective criteria of hybrid coupled networks are derived based on fixed-time and finite-time stability analysis.

40|$|Recently it {{has been}} {{recognized}} that many complex social, technological and biological networks have a multilayer nature and can be described by multiplex networks. Multiplex networks are formed {{by a set of}} nodes connected by links having different connotations forming the different layers of the multiplex. Characterizing the centrality of the nodes in a multiplex network is a challenging task since the centrality of the node naturally depends on the importance associated to links of a certain type.

However, most current negotiation research looks only at single issue negotiation and thus does not present techniques to reason and manage <b>multilinked</b> issues. In this paper, we present a technique based on the use of a partial-order schedule and a measure of the schedule, called flexibility, which enables an agent to reason explicitly about the interactions among multiple negotiation issues. We show how an agent uses the partial-order schedule to effectively manage interacting negotiation issues; and how the flexibility is a key measure for ordering and managing negotiation issues.

40|$|Preface In {{the region}} of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), {{population}} ageing is the dominant demographic trend of this century. Simultaneously, other pertinent demographic developments such as declining fertility, increasing age at family formation, and changing family patterns also challenge many areas of public policy. The policy responses have to include reconciliation of work and family life and measures to facilitate flexibility in life-course transitions among education, work and retirement. Equally important is to promot intergenerational solidarity and collaboration, and ensure gender equality in family, community and society at large. In the UNECE Regional Implementation Strategy for the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing (2002) and in the León Ministerial Declaration “A Society for All Ages: Challenges and Opportunities” (2007), UNECE member States have committed themselves to respond to challenges and opportunities of their ageing societies. In 2008, UNECE established the Working Group on Ageing – an intergovernmental body with the mandate to coordinate and streamline implementation of major international policy documents on ageing. In order to provide knowledge base for population policy measures, the UNECE initiated in 2000 and continue to coordinate the Generations and Gender Programme (GGP). GGP has two main pillars: the first pillar is the system of national Generations and Gender Surveys (GGS), and the second pillar is the contextual database that provides information on macrolevel factors influencing demographic trends. GGP also serves as an important source of data in various programme elements of the Working Group on Ageing. One of the many international research initiatives based on GGP data is the <b>Multilinks</b> project led by the Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute. <b>Multilinks</b> is specifically designed to support sound policymaking through new insights into how changing social contexts are affecting social integration and intergenerational solidarity in different European countries. Relying on the conceptual framework of that project, and based on the examples of policies and programmes from UNECE countries, the Working Group on Ageing held an in-depth discussion on intergenerational relationships at its second meeting in 2009. This report is derived from this in-depth discussion. It also summarises the most relevant research findings in the area of intergenerational family relationships. UNECE is grateful to the author and UNECE member States for contributing to this report. UNECE also wishes to acknowledge the financial support from the European Commission, which was essential for establishing and functioning the <b>Multilinks</b> research project. It is expected that this report will be of interest to a broad audience concerned with matters of intergenerational relationships, and will increase awareness about the need for policy measures for promoting greater solidarity among family members of all ages...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown co-existing trunk-leg {{coordination}} patterns during quiet stance: in-phase and anti-phase for frequencies below and above 1 Hz, respectively. Two experiments investigated whether the nervous system assumes a <b>multilinked</b> internal model in sensory coupling?

Trunk-leg coherence decreased with the addition of static vision and light touch, in the AP and ML directions, respectively, at frequencies below 1 Hz, suggesting the in-phase pattern may be more affected by neural control than the anti-phase pattern. In the second experiment, we compared translation of the visual field to a rotation relative to the ankle/hip. Gain and phase between the trunk/leg angles relative to the visual display showed only minor condition differences. The overall results suggest the nervous system adopts a simple control strategy of a single-link internal model at low frequencies...|$|R
