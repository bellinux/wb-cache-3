25|$|It {{has been}} found that {{bevirimat}} does not inhibit the cytochrome P450 system or interact with the human P-glycoprotein. Unformulated bevirimat is not well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract into the blood. Some of the less desirable properties of unformulated bevirimat and its salts include: inadequate bioavailability, poor solubility of the pharmaceutical composition in gastric fluid, insufficient dispersion of bevirimat in gastric fluid, below standard long term safety profile for oral dosage forms, below standard long term chemical and physical stability of the final dosage form, tendency for conversion to metastable forms, lengthy dissolution times for oral dosage forms, and precipitation in gastric or intestinal fluids. Some pharmaceutical compositions of formulated bevirimat have shown to have better properties over unformulated bevirimat. Some of these properties include: improved bioavailability, improved solubility of the composition in gastric fluid, improved dispersion of bevirimat in gastric fluid, improved safety for oral dosage forms, improved chemical and physical stability of the oral dosage form, decreased conversion to metastable forms, and decreased rate of precipitation in gastric fluid. Bevirimat was rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with detectable concentrations present in the plasma within 15 minutes after administration and peak plasma concentrations were achieved approximately one to three hours after administration. The plasma had a <b>mean</b> <b>plasma</b> elimination half-life ranging from 58 to 80 hours. This long half-life of bevirimat supports once-daily dosing.

With this perspective in mind, this study was carried out. MethodsFifty women were enrolled in this study. Thirty of these had delivered neonates who were diagnosed to have congenital heart diseases. These were treated as cases. Twenty of these women had delivered neonates who did not have any congenital heart diseases and were treated as controls. For estimating the levels of plasma homocysteine, fasting blood samples were taken from the women in both groups. ResultsOut of 30 cases, 14 (46. 6 %) had a tHcy level more than 15 μmol/l and all these women had delivered babies who were found to have congenital heart diseases. Out of controls, only 3 (15 %) had a tHcy level more than 15 μmol/l. In babies with ventricular septal defects, the <b>mean</b> maternal <b>plasma</b> tHcy level was 13. 30 μmol/l.

50|$|Parecoxib sodium is a {{water-soluble}} inactive ester amide prodrug of valdecoxib, a novel second-generation COX-2-specific inhibitor and {{the first}} such agent to be developed for injectable use. It is rapidly converted by hepatic enzymatic hydrolysis to the active form valdecoxib. The compound then undergoes another conversion, which involves both cytochrome P450-mediated pathway (CYP2C9, CYP3A4) and non-cytochrome P450-mediated pathway, to hydroxylated metabolite and glucuronide metabolite. The hydroxylated metabolite, that also has weak COX-2-specific inhibitory properties, is then further metabolized by non-cytochrome P450 pathway to a glucuronide metabolite. These metabolites are excreted in the urine.After intra-muscular administration of Parecoxib sodium peak plasma concentration is reached within 15 minutes. The plasma concentration decreases rapidly after administration because of a rather short serum half-life, which is about 15-52 minutes. This {{can be explained by}} the rapid formation of Valdecoxib. In contrast to the rapid clearance of Parecoxib, plasma concentration of Valdecoxib declines slowly because of a longer half-life. On the other hand, when Valdecoxib is taken orally it is absorbed rapidly (1-2 hours), but presence of food can delay peak serum concentration. It then undergoes the same metabolism that is described above. It is extensively protein-bound (98%), and the plasma half-life is about 7-8 hours. Note that the half-life can be significantly prolonged in the elderly or those with hepatic impairment, and can lead to drug accumulation.The hydroxyl metabolite reaches its highest <b>mean</b> <b>plasma</b> concentration within 3 to 4 hours from administration, but it is considerably lower than of Valdecoxib or about 1/10 of the plasma levels of Valdecoxib.|$|E
