5|$|However, {{fulfilling}} these promises proves {{costly and}} Mayor Quimby denounces Homer for spending the department's yearly budget {{in only a}} month. Homer gets cities all over the United States to pay him to store their excess garbage into an abandoned mine shaft {{on the outskirts of}} Springfield. Despite the budget crisis having ended and the workers receiving their salaries as promised, the garbage builds up underground and eventually erupts, pouring trash all over the town. At a town hall meeting, Homer is fired from his post and replaced with Ray Patterson, who declines reinstatement. With no other options left, Quimby moves the entire town five <b>miles</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> road.|$|E

For the 2010 season he moved a few <b>miles</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> road to Skelmanthorpe Cricket Club, and broke the league record for runs scored in a single season. In the 2011 season Jaffer signed to Himley CC in the Birmingham and District Premier League.|$|E
25|$|In 860, {{according}} to an account by the Norman monk Dudo of Saint-Quentin, a Viking fleet, probably under Björn Ironside and Hastein, landed at the Ligurian port of Luni and sacked the city.

25|$|As {{the highway}} {{approaches}} Bridgeport {{from the south}} it joins up with US26 to cross the North Platte River. On {{the south side of}} town, US26 continues to the west where it passes Chimney Rock National Historic Site just twelve <b>miles</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> road. Continuing north across the river the two highways diverge, with US26 heading east towards Broadwater and Ogallala while US385 resumes its northward heading. For a brief few miles the roadway is, again, surrounded by agricultural fields, brought to life with center pivot irrigation north of Bridgeport. The highway transitions into slightly rugged terrain as it climbs back up, 400 feet, out of the valley.|$|E
25|$|Herbert was {{presented}} with the Prebendary of Leighton Bromswold in the Diocese of Lincoln in 1626, whilst {{he was still a}} don at Trinity College, Cambridge but not yet ordained. He was not even present at his institution as prebend as it is recorded that Peter Walker, his clerk, stood in as his proxy. In the same year his close Cambridge friend Nicholas Ferrar was ordained Deacon in Westminster Abbey by Bishop Laud on Trinity Sunday 1626 and went to Little Gidding, two <b>miles</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> road from Leighton Bromswold, to found the remarkable community with which his name has ever since been associated. Herbert raised money (including the use of his own) to restore the neglected church building at Leighton.|$|E
25|$|The {{most intense}} action amongst these six captures {{occurred}} off Santiago de Cuba on 14 March when Loring saw a privateer schooner in a bay. He sent boats {{to bring her}} out but the enemy had established fortifications on the two heights that guarded the bay. From there, the enemy was able to repulse the attack, killing the lieutenant {{in command of the}} boats. Lark then put ashore a landing party some ten <b>miles</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> coast. This landing party marched up the coast and attacked the privateer from the rear with the result that when Loring led boats back into the bay he found the landing party had already captured the quarry. The privateer had two carriage guns and Loring destroyed her rather than bring her out.|$|E

25|$|After {{reaching}} the Great Slave Lake using the standard HBC route, Franklin took a reconnaissance trip 1,000 <b>miles</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Mackenzie and on 16 August 1825, became the second European {{to reach its}} mouth. He erected a flagpole with buried letters for Parry. He returned to winter at Fort Franklin on the Great Bear Lake. The following summer he went downriver and found the ocean frozen. He worked his way west for several hundred miles and gave up on 16 August 1826 at Return Reef {{when he was about}} 150 miles east of Beechey's Point Barrow. Reaching safety at Fort Franklin on 21 September, he left Fort Franklin on 20 February 1827 and {{spent the rest of the}} winter and spring at Fort Chipewyan, Alberta. He reached Liverpool on the first of September 1827. Richardson's eastward journey was more successful.|$|E
500|$|The {{collapse}} of the northern flank of St. Helens mixed with ice, snow, and water to create lahars (volcanic mudflows).

Initially serving to {{compensate}} for the loss of common rights after common land was enclosed in 1802, it was held in trust until 1889 when ownership passed to Bournemouth Corporation and the land became five public parks: King's Park, Queen's Park, Meyrick Park, Seafield Gardens and Redhill Common.|$|E

Two more <b>miles</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> highway, at a rest area, Highway 82 turns east as it enters the city of Carbondale across the river. A mile from the rest area, a traffic signal controls the intersection with State Highway 133, the only other state highway to intersect 82 for its entire length. From Carbondale, Highway 133 leads south to Redstone and McClure Pass along the valley of {{a tributary of the}} Roaring Fork, the Crystal River. To the south the [...] Mount Sopris dominates the view.|$|E
500|$|The Ambrose {{leader cable}} was an armored cable {{with a single}} {{internal}} conductor (see picture) that acted like a long radio antenna laid on the Channel floor. It originated at Fort Lafayette (near the present day Verrazano-Narrows Bridge), then extended 16 <b>miles</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Ambrose Channel to the vicinity of Lightship Ambrose offshore. [...] It was powered by a generator at Fort Lafayette that produced 500Hz (cycles per second) current at 400volts, resulting in an alternating electromagnetic field {{along the length of}} the cable that could be detected to approximately a thousand yards away. [...] The current was mechanically keyed to send the word [...] "NAVY" [...] in Morse Code.|$|E

500|$|Thus, Innis {{travelled}} extensively {{beginning in}} the summer of 1924 when he and a friend paddled an [...] canvas-covered canoe hundreds of <b>miles</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Peace River to Lake Athabasca; then down the Slave River to Great Slave Lake. They completed their journey down the Mackenzie, Canada's longest river, to the Arctic Ocean on a small Hudson's Bay Company tug. During his travels, Innis supplemented his fur research by gathering information on other staple products such as lumber, pulp and paper, minerals, grain and fish. He travelled so extensively that by the early 1940s, he had visited every part of Canada except for the Western Arctic and the east side of Hudson Bay.|$|E
500|$|In 1997, Adams {{experienced}} two slides {{seven weeks}} apart {{that were the}} largest slides in the Cascades, ignoring the catastrophic landslide eruption of Mount St. Helens, since a slide that occurred on Little Tahoma in 1963. The first occurred {{at the end of}} August and consisted of mainly snow and ice with some rock. It fell from a similar location and in a similar path to the slide of 1921. The second slide that year occurred in late October and originated high on Battlement Ridge just below The Castle. It consisted of mainly rock and flowed three <b>miles</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Klickitat Glacier and the Big Muddy Creek streambed. Both slides were estimated to have moved as much as [...] of material.|$|E
500|$|Another {{cluster of}} great houses lies in Chaco's {{northern}} reaches; {{among the largest}} is Casa Chiquita ("Small House"), a village built in the 1080s, when, {{in a period of}} ample rainfall, Chacoan culture was expanding. Its layout featured a smaller, squarer profile; it also lacked the open plazas and separate kivas of its predecessors. Larger, squarer blocks of stone were used in the masonry; kivas were designed in the northern Mesa Verdean tradition. Two <b>miles</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> canyon is Peñasco Blanco ("White Bluff"), an arc-shaped compound built atop the canyon's southern rim in five distinct stages between 900 and 1125.

500|$|African-American {{travelers}} faced real physical risks {{because of}} the widely differing rules of segregation that existed from place to place, {{and the possibility of}} extrajudicial violence against them. Activities that were accepted in one place could provoke violence a few <b>miles</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> road. Transgressing formal or unwritten racial codes, even inadvertently, could put travelers in considerable danger. Even driving etiquette was affected by racism; in the Mississippi Delta region, local custom prohibited blacks from overtaking whites, to prevent their raising dust from the unpaved roads to cover white-owned cars. A pattern emerged of whites purposefully damaging black-owned cars to put their owners [...] "in their place". Stopping anywhere that was not known to be safe, even to allow children in a car to relieve themselves, presented a risk; Milloy noted that his parents would urge him and his brother to control their need to use a bathroom until they could find a safe place to stop, as [...] "those backroads were simply too dangerous for parents to stop to let their little black children pee".|$|E
500|$|The first {{ball of the}} First Test, at the Gabba in Brisbane, bowled wildly wide by Steve Harmison set {{the tone}} for the series. [...] However, on the fourth day, England seemed to be batting towards a draw, when Collingwood, who had worked his way to a hard–earned 96 was stumped [...] "...skipping <b>miles</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> pitch and trying to smack Warne over his head to reach a hundred". This was a pivotal moment: England went on to lose the next six wickets for 126 runs, and so lost the Test match. [...] In the Second Test at Adelaide, Collingwood made a career-best 206 in England's first innings, sharing in a 310–run fourth–wicket stand with Pietersen; he became only the eighth English double centurion against Australia in Ashes history, and the first in Australia since Wally Hammond scored 251 and 200 in {{consecutive}} innings during the 1928–29 Ashes. [...] In the second innings he added an unbeaten 22 from 119 balls over nearly 3 hours, while England collapsed to 129 all out and so went 2–0 down. [...] Collingwood received some praise but mostly criticism from commentators on the manner in which he batted with the tail-enders.|$|E
