The deletion has endpoints in bioA and galE, {{and leaves the}} operator-proximal end of bioA intact and the regulatory sites themselves functional. In bacterial strains which carry the deletion, the expression of galK is regulated by biotin, although due to the inefficiency of the bioA promoter even the fully derepressed level of galactokinase is low.

A proteolytic enzyme catalyzing the limited hydrolysis of carboxymethylated γ′ chain of globulin was found to be present in the protein bodies.

40|$|The {{chromium}} nitrides {{effects on}} duplex stainless steels low temperature impact toughness and durability were investigated. A duplex rolled ring was cut as different blocks, and different Cr₂N amounts {{were obtained by}} trial heat treatments, with the solution annealing furnace temperature set at low and high levels, 1040 and 1140 °C respectively, and the transfer time ranging between 5 and 120 s {{in order to prevent}} the σ phase formation. <b>Micrographic</b> <b>examinations,</b> low temperature Charpy impact tests and durability assessments were carried out on specimens sampled from the blocks cores. The material strength was evaluated by hardness tests. The results showed how an increase in transfer time allows the N diffusion in the austenite phase, reducing the nitrides quantity in the ferrite phase. A synergistic effect between the transfer time and the solution annealing temperature on the amount of intermetallic particles was observed. Clear effects of the Cr₂N presence on both material low temperature impact toughness and pitting corrosion resistance were found...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{aeronautical}} structures, assemblies {{with thin}} laminates {{are becoming increasingly}} usual, especially for fuselage design. In these structures, out-of-plane loads can appear in bolted joints {{and can lead to}} progressive punching of the fastenerâs head in the laminate resulting, in some cases, in a failure mode called pull-through [1]. This complex phenomenon, which occurs in assemblies, was studied firstly by using a simplified ââcircularââ pull-through test method. Qualitative <b>micrographic</b> <b>examinations</b> showed damage very similar to that observed in impacted specimens. The research presented here extends the Discrete Ply Model Method (DPM) developed by Bouvet et al. [2] to this case. The finite elements model is based on a particular mesh taking ply orientations into account. Cohesive elements are placed at the interfaces between solid elements to represent matrix cracks and delamination, thus allowing the natural coupling between these two damage modes to be represented. The model shows good correlation with test results, in terms of load/displacement curve, and correct prediction of the damage map until failure, including the splitting phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|The high {{alloying}} {{degree of}} Duplex stainless steels makes them {{susceptible to the}} formation of intermetallic phases during their exposure to high temperatures. Precipitation of these phases can lead to a decreasing of the corrosion resistance and sometimes of the toughness. Starting from the advantages of the synergic Metal Active Gas (MAG) pulsed welding process, this paper analyses the structure formation particularities of homogeneous welded joints from Duplex stainless steel. The effect of linear welding energy on the structure morphology of the welded joints was revealed by macro- and <b>micrographic</b> <b>examinations,</b> X-ray energy dispersion analyses, measurements of ferrite proportion and X-ray diffraction analysis. The results obtained showed that the transformation of ferrite into austenite is associated with the chromium, nickel, molybdenum and nitrogen distribution between these two phases and their redistribution degree is closely linked to the overall heat cycle of the welding process. The adequate control of the energy inserted in the welded components provides an optimal balance between the two microstructural constituents (Austenite and Ferrite) and avoids the formation of undesirable intermetallic phases...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} model for the {{structure}} of isolated bovine adrenal medulla chromaffin granules derived from the dependence of granule density on the osmotic pressure of the suspension medium at 2 degrees C. The granule consists of a flexible, inelastic membrane bounding an osmotically active core. The core consists of a solution space and a separate, nonosmotic phase. Since the granule behaves like a "perfect" osmometer over a wide range of osmolarities, we conclude that (a) within these limits, the core consists of a constant amount of condensed material and a constant number of particles in solution, (b) from the constraints of the osmometer model, the osmolality inside the granule must equal the osmolality outside. Therefore the high concentrations of catecholamines (greater than 0. 7 M) and ATP (greater than 0. 18 M) measured biochemically cannot be dissolved in the core solution as separate molecules, but must be condensed into larger aggregates. These results are supported by electron <b>micrographic</b> <b>examination</b> of the effect of osmotic pressure changes on granule morphology...|$|E
40|$|The {{so called}} 'nicotine stain' {{documented}} at many locations on the Long Duration Exposure Facility is still unexplained {{as to the}} exact origin and mechanism of deposition, although enough {{is known to have}} some understanding of the conditions coincident for the formation of the deposits. Direct and scattered atomic oxygen flux, and solar ultraviolet radiation interacting with materials outgassing products have all been implicated {{in the formation of the}} dark brown contamination deposits. The nicotine stain represents a potential of performance degradation for spacecraft designed for long term operation in low Earth orbit and therefore, a need exists to characterize this form of spacecraft self contamination and quantify the impact on thermal/optical systems. Optical property measurements in the spectral range of 2 to 10 microns were performed on specimens of the contaminated film. Reflectance measurements of the contaminant film as deposited on the surface and as free standing films are presented along with transmission spectra for the bulk material. Thickness measurements along with <b>micrographic</b> <b>examination</b> of the cross section of the deposit reveal the layered structure of the deposit which further implicates solar illumination as a factor in the deposition mechanism...|$|E
40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{study of the}} relationship between the laser process parameters and the mechanical properties of welded high carbon steels was performed utilizing a Lumonics Nd:YAG pulsed laser, operating at 1. 06 μm, and a robotically manipulated fiber optic beam delivery system. A gage plate (0. 88 mm thick) was butt welded with a constant power of 200 W and a He shielding gas was used at a pressure of 5 × 10 4 Pa. The welding performance of the Nd:YAG laser was strongly affected by the translation velocity, pulse length and pulse repetition frequency (PRF). The effects of varying these process parameters were quantified by measuring the sample's hardness profile, weld width, weld penetration, and tensile strength. Furthermore, <b>micrographic</b> <b>examinations</b> were conducted at the welded joints. It was shown that by increasing the pulse length and pulse repetition frequency a deeper weld penetration and a wider bead width were achieved; moreover, the weld region became tougher. Hardness profiles transverse across the weldment and as a function of weld depth were greatly reduced with increasing PRF. The quality of the laser weld was dominated by the rapid quenching rate which resulted in the weld structure being completely modified near the heat affected zone...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{surface of}} work rolls and back up rolls is worn out during hot rolling of heavy plates and strip steel because of micro {{structural}} changes and induced crack propagation. After {{the operation of}} the rolls in the mills, the surface will be regenerated by the following grinding process in the roll shops. This provides sufficient surface conditions for the next set in service. The roll shops of ThyssenKrupp Stahl will be gradually equipped with modern eddy current and ultrasonic techniques. The procedure for the implementation of these NDE techniques into the roll shop of a heavy plate mill will be described exemplarily. In the first step after bringing the installations into operational use, the former practice skills should be considered within the calibration of the systems. For this, the workmanship is documented by a statistical analysis of the signals obtained by these two non-destructive testing devices. Accordingly, the sensitivity of the operating systems is determined by comparing signals obtained from artificial notches with signals obtained from roll damages. These results are confirmed by taking <b>micrographic</b> <b>examinations</b> of the roll surface. After accurate confirmation {{of the relationship between the}} obtained signals and the condition of the rolls, the systems are fully set in service and integrated into {{the operation of the}} roll shop. This methodical approach contributes to a considerable benefit during the operation of the rolls since their service life is prolonged significantly. 1...|$|R

Carbonate mineralogy, grain size, grain density, porosity, bulk density and velocity measurements were systematically collected. In addition, bulk sediment []??O values were analyzed. Generally, there is a positive correlation between velocity, bulk density, percent sand, and high magnesium calcite and a negative relationship between velocity, percent clay, porosity, water content and low magnesium calcite. Down-core, bulk sediment []??O variability is a direct indicator of climate and sea level fluctuations. Glacial sediments, deposited during sea level lowstands, are isotopically heavy and characteristically have higher velocity, bulk density, sand and high magnesium calcite values, and lower measured clay content, porosity, water content and low magnesium calcite values than interglacial sediments. Property variability is influenced by regional differences in slope morphology, depositional controls, and water depth as well as physical, chemical, and biological processes and the properties of regional (intermediate) water masses. Identification of the glacial-interglacial transition and related physical and acoustic properties may be applied to high resolution seismic data interpretation and may enhance our understanding of the regional environmental conditions responsible for property formation...|$|R
40|$|The mediodorsal {{nucleus of}} the {{thalamus}} (MD) represents the main subcortical structure that projects to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and regulates key aspects of the cognitive functions of this region. Within the PFC, GABA local circuit neurons shape the activity patterns and hence the "memory fields" of pyramidal cells. Although the connections between the MD and PFC are well established, {{little attention has been}} given to the functional connections between projecting fibers from the MD and different subclasses of GABA cells in the PFC. In order to address this issue in the rat, we examined MD axons labeled by tract-tracing in combination with immunogold-silver to identify different calcium binding proteins localized within separate populations of interneurons. Electron <b>micrographic</b> <b>examination</b> of PFC sections from these animals revealed that MD terminals made primarily asymmetric synapses onto dendritic spines and less commonly onto dendritic shafts. Most of the dendrites receiving MD synaptic input were immunoreactive for parvalbumin (ParV), whereas dendrites labeled for calretinin or calbindin received synapses from MD fibers less frequently. We also observed that some MD terminals were themselves immunoreactive for calcium binding proteins, again more commonly for ParV. These results suggest that the MD exerts a dual influence on PFC pyramidal cells: direct inputs onto spines and an indirect influence mediated via synapses onto each subclass of interneurons. The preferential input to ParV cells endows MD afferents with a strong indirect influence on pyramidal cell activity by virtue of ParV cell synapses onto soma, proximal dendrites and axon initial segments...|$|E
40|$|Legionella pneumophila {{infection}} of macrophages from permissive guinea pigs and from A/J mice compared with {{infection of}} cells from nonpermissive BDF 1 mice was studied by electron microscopy. The {{cells from the}} BDF 1 mice were nonpermissive for legionella growth in vitro and showed few if any bacteria in phagosomes by electron microscopic examination. Similar electron <b>micrographic</b> <b>examination</b> of macrophages from A/J mice permissive for legionella growth showed numerous intact intracellular bacteria within 24 to 48 h of culture and the transition of intracellular bacteria from localization in a few large vacuoles early {{in the course of}} infection to later localization in areas surrounded and studded by ribosomes. These electron microscopic observations were similar to those seen in the case of guinea pig macrophages infected with legionellae. Biochemical studies of macrophages from permissive versus nonpermissive animals showed little or no differences in respiratory burst and lysosomal enzyme activity for macrophages from all animals tested. However, when zymosan was used as a stimulant, macrophages from the nonpermissive mouse strain produced a larger amount of H 2 O 2 and O 2 - than did cells from permissive guinea pigs or A/J mice. However, legionella vaccine itself induced no detectable or very little H 2 O 2 and O 2 - in macrophages tested from any source. These results suggest that permissiveness of A/J mouse macrophages to legionella growth may involve mechanisms similar to those occurring in guinea pig macrophages in terms of morphologic and possibly even biochemical events. The relatively higher production of reactive oxygens by BDF 1 mouse macrophages in response to zymosan correlated with nonpermissiveness for legionella growth, although further analysis is necessary to link these observations...|$|E

Rafts of eggs are held together by an extrachorionic secretion located between the tubercles and by mechanical interdigitation of tubercles. Mosquitoes exposed to sublethal doses of the insect growth regulator, methoprene, laid egg rafts that were less organized and more loosely constructed than those of females not exposed to methoprene. Eggs from treated females had shorter tubercles, and excess cementum coated the egg covering the mesh network that formed the air/water jacket used for respiration by the developing embryos. Consequently, hatchability was greatly reduced. The female accessory gland also was studied to investigate its role in the synthesis of egg raft secretions. The gland consisted of a layer of glandular epithelium surrounding a central lumen which connects to the common oviduct. Examination of the organelles within the gland cells indicated that they produce the extrachorionic secretion that helps hold the eggs together in the raft. The accessory gland differed in size and shape at different stages of the ovarian cycle, suggesting that its secretary activity was correlated with oviposition. Larval exposure to sublethal doses of methoprene affected the accessory glands of surviving females. The cells of the gland were more acidophilic than glands from untreated controls. Vacuoles began appearing in the cytoplasm of the accessory glands as the cementum was secreted faster than it could be produced by the gland. These effects on the female accessory gland, {{as well as on the}} development times, did not appear to be dosage dependent...|$|R

An analog study conducted by the Ocean Drilling Program Leg 155 identified and described Amazon Fan HARPs as a stacked, relatively unconfined series of graded turbidites overlain by a channel-levee. HARP seismic facies thin laterally and onlap antecedent bathymetry (preexisting submarine topography). HARP areal extent is controlled by antecedent bathymetry and turbidity flow sediment volumes. Mississippi Fan HARP deposition can be described by three depositional models: the "avulsion" model, the "fill and spill" model, and the "transition" model. The "avulsion" depositional model, developed by Flood et al. (1991), describes avulsion of submarine channel-levees by turbidity flows. Subsequent turbidity flows exit the channel-levee at the avulsion point and are deposited as unchannelized HARPs. The "fill and spill" model, developed by Satterfield and Behrens (1990), describes turbidite deposition in the Gulf of Mexico salt province. Initial stages of the "fill and spill" model accurately describe the seismic geometries of HARPs confined by adjacent salt structures. The "transition" model was developed in this study to describe the Gulf of Mexico HARP seismic geometries seen in the transition zone from the salt province to the abyssal plain. The HARPs described by the "transition" model contain an upslope segment confined by salt structures and a downslope segment confined by antecedent bathymetry. Utilizing seismic data from the Gulf of Mexico and core and well-log data from the Amazon Fan, this study has determined that HARPs and related channel-levees have hydrocarbon play potential. HARP sheet sands, internal HARP channel fill, overlying channel-levee fill, and overbank levee sands are potential reservoir units. Detrital carbonate and hemipelagic shale source rocks are in place in the deep-water Gulf of Mexico. In addition, structurally derived migration pathways combine with percolation as potential migration processes. This study integrates identification and description of HARP seismic facies relationships, current and newly developed depositional models, interpretation of stratigraphic controls, HARP internal reservoir architecture, and determination of HARP hydrocarbon potential in order to predict HARP deposition in the Mississippi Fan and other mud-rich fans worldwide...|$|R

We (1) tested a novel coupled PCR-mass spectroscopic assay (the Ibis T 5000) on an ankle arthroplasty that was culture negative on pre-operative aspiration, and then (2) confirmed that the Ibis assay had in fact detected viable multi-species biofilm by further <b>micrographic</b> and molecular <b>examinations,</b> including confocal microscopy using Live/Dead stain, bacterial fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and reverse-transciptase-PCR (RT-PCR) assay for bacterial messenger RNA.

Viable S. aureus were confirmed using RT-PCR, and viable cocci in biofilm configuration were detected microscopically on both tissue and hardware. Species-specific bacterial FISH confirmed a poly-microbial biofilm containing S. aureus. A novel culture method recovered S. aureus and S. epidermidis (both methicillin-resistant) from the tibial metal component.

Both experimental and calculational studies were performed. The MCNP- 4 A code was used as the major analysis tool. The nuclear data libraries and usage of MCNP- 4 A was verified by comparison to photon dose rates from experiments with isotopic photon sources placed inside an ALR 8 (SI) container. An MCNP- 4 A model of an ALR 8 (SI) container with a "hypothetical" ex-weapons pit inside was also formulated. The hypothetical pit consisted of a hollow sphere of plutonium encased in stainless steel. Data for the gamma ray intensities from the decay of the plutonium isotopes were taken from the LANL web site, "Map of the Nuclides. '' All of the energy lines from the isotopes in weapons-grade plutonium were used for the photon source description. Dose rates due to the photons emitted by the hypothetical pit were calculated at various positions external to the ALR 8 (SI) container. Since Pu- 241 may undergo significant decay during the possible period of storage, the effect of varying the amount of Am- 241 in the hypothetical pit's plutonium was considered. The criticality and neutron dose rates around the ALR 8 (SI) container with a hypothetical pit inside were also calculated using MCNP- 4 A. To increase the computational efficiency, the neutron dose rate calculations were carried out using the neutron source distribution at the pit surface that was generated during the criticality calculations.
