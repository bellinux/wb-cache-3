50|$|The Court then applied this {{framework}} to the <b>medical</b> <b>opinions</b> {{provided by the}} doctors. The Court held that a claims file review is not a requirement for private <b>medical</b> <b>opinions,</b> reasoning that the expert witness could nevertheless be informed of the sufficient facts or data. In supporting this, the Court specifically {{pointed out that the}} Board did not explain what exactly was in the file that was so important that it detracted from the probative value of the private <b>medical</b> <b>opinions.</b> The Court noted, however, that review of the claims folder may be a prerequisite to ensure that the testimony is based on sufficient facts.|$|R

Lawson, subsequently discovered that he had been operated on without any anaesthesia, other than a muscle relaxant. She started a vigorous awareness campaign which created such a public, and medical, reaction that by 1987 <b>medical</b> <b>opinion</b> had come full circle.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{identified}} {{causes of the}} waste {{in the health care}} system is a lack of communication between doctors and patients. The decisions of physicians account for most of a patient's expenses, yet physicians work under various pressures including limited time to talk with patients and review their information. Patients sometimes make requests for treatment against their doctor's advice in cases where more effective choices would be made if doctors had time to consult expert <b>medical</b> <b>opinion.</b>|$|E

Mainstream <b>medical</b> <b>opinion</b> continued to support the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine; public confidence was restored after the publication of a national reassessment of vaccine efficacy. Vaccine uptake then increased to levels above 90%, and disease incidence declined dramatically.|$|E
25|$|On December 20, 2013, McMath's family filed {{a lawsuit}} in Alameda County Superior Court, petitioning the court to require Children's Hospital Oakland to keep McMath on life support. In a pretrial conference on December 23, Judge Evelio Grillo {{appointed}} Paul Graham Fisher, M.D., the chief of Child Neurology at Stanford University School of Medicine, to provide an independent <b>medical</b> <b>opinion</b> regarding the declaration of brain death. McMath's family also requested to have Paul A. Byrne, M.D. conduct a separate evaluation. Byrne, a pediatric neonatologist, has campaigned against the medical consensus of accepting brain death as death. The court denied that request.|$|E
25|$|The {{law also}} {{attaches}} {{importance to the}} preservation of life: aiding and abetting a suicide is a criminal offence under the Suicide Act 1961 and euthanasia is unlawful (see the Bland case). Furthermore, there is a duty upon medical professionals to keep patients alive unless to do so would be contrary to the patient's best interests based on professional <b>medical</b> <b>opinion</b> (the Bolam Test), taking into account their quality of life in the event that treatment is continued.

25|$|Transsexual self-identified people {{sometimes}} wish to undergo physical surgery to refashion their primary sexual characteristics, secondary characteristics, or both, {{because they feel}} {{they will be more}} comfortable with different genitalia. This may involve removal of penis, testicles or breasts, or the fashioning of a penis, vagina or breasts. In the past, sex assignment surgery has been performed on infants who are born with ambiguous genitalia. However, current <b>medical</b> <b>opinion</b> is strongly against this procedure, since many adults have regretted that these decisions were made for them at birth. Today, sex reassignment surgery is performed on people who choose to have this change so that their anatomical sex will match their gender identity.|$|E
25|$|Hair of the dog: The {{belief is}} that {{consumption}} of further alcohol after the onset of a hangover will relieve symptoms, based upon {{the theory that the}} hangover represents a form of alcohol withdrawal and that by satiating the body's need for alcohol the symptoms will be relieved. Social drinkers and alcoholics claim that drinking more alcohol gives relief from hangover symptoms, but research shows that the use of alcohol as a hangover cure seems to predict current or future problem drinking and alcohol use disorder, through negative reinforcement and the development of physical dependence. While the practice is popular in tradition and promoted by many sellers of alcoholic beverages, <b>medical</b> <b>opinion</b> holds that the practice merely postpones the symptoms, and courts addiction. Favored choices include Fernet Branca and Bloody Mary.|$|E
25|$|At 19:00 AEST, Tim Mander, officiating his 2nd grand final, blew time {{on and the}} Tigers kicked off. In {{the eighth}} minute the Cowboys had almost reached the Tigers' twenty-metre line on the third tackle of the set when Payne ran from dummy-half and passed inside for Rauhihi {{to hit the ball}} up and stand in the takle, {{offloading}} to Thurston who passed to Matt Bowen. Bowen then threw a deft pass back on the inside to Justin Smith who charged toward the line and threw the ball blindly back over his head before being tackled. The loose ball was picked up by Thurtson and handed to Bowen to dash the remaining few metres to the line and touch down behind the uprights. For the third week in a row, Bowen was the first try scorer of the game. Josh Hannay converted the try so the Cowboys were leading 0-6. Ten minutes later the Tigers were down at the opposition's end of the field where halfback Scott Prince on the last tackle put up a kick that came down over the try line and was taken by Paul Bowman who was about to be tackled in goal and threw a speculative pass which was not caught by his teammate and Tigers forward Bryce Gibbs was there to fall onto the loose ball near the goal posts. Brett Hodgson kicked the extra two points so the scores were even at 6-6. Cowboys winger Ty Williams crossed the Tigers' try-line in the twenty-third minute but the video referee ruled no try due to an obstruction in back play. A few minutes later, Tigers' left winger Pat Richards (whose fractured ankle required six pain-killing injections for him to defy <b>medical</b> <b>opinion</b> and play in the match) crossed in the corner but the video referee disallowed the try as the ball was not properly grounded. In the thirty-fifth minute the Tigers received a Johnathan Thurston kick on their own try line, the ball going to Benji Marshall who ran with it, splitting the defence and charging down the left side and over the half-way line. Drawing a defender, Marshall then threw a flick pass behind his back to his winger Pat Richards coming through in support. Richards palmed off a Cowboys defender as he ran the remaining twenty metres to dive over and score, finishing {{one of the most famous}} grand final plays in history. Hodgson kicked the extra two points so now the Tigers were leading 12-6. Shortly before half time the Cowboys were penalised on their twenty-metre line and Hodgson took the kick at goal but missed.|$|E

500|$|Although {{similar to}} the stress {{fracture}} injury Brandon McCarthy suffered, it was deemed less severe. [...] According to <b>medical</b> <b>opinion,</b> {{it was part of}} the same injury process, but Wacha's injury had not progressed as far as McCarthy's as a fracture had yet to occur. [...] Therefore, Cardinals general manager John Mozeliak stated, as [...] "a precursor to a stress fracture, ... which is a precursor to a ... fracture," [...] it was more manageable to correct. [...] With limited knowledge on the related biomechanical processes, the Cardinals training and medical staff researched methods to treat Wacha's injury and prevent the same course from happening again; likewise, they were uncertain of when he was to return to play.|$|E

It included a <b>medical</b> <b>opinion</b> from Yehuda David, the doctor who treated Jamal in 1994. The report said it is [...] "highly doubtful that bullet holes in the vicinity of the two could have had their source in fire from the Israeli position," [...] and that the France 2 report was [...] "edited and narrated in such a way as to create the misleading impression that it substantiated the claims made therein." [...] The France 2 narrative relied entirely on the cameraman's opinion, the report said.

500|$|In 1948, Bouchard {{became the}} first Quebec-born captain of the Canadiens, a {{position}} he retained for eight years until his retirement. At {{the time of his}} retirement no player had served more years as captain of the Canadiens than Bouchard. Hall of Famer Jean Béliveau, a teammate of Bouchard for Beliveau's early years with the Canadiens, said Bouchard was the model for his time as captain in the 1960s. Bouchard was a well-respected leader and played a role in supporting and mentoring the younger players. Never afraid to speak up to management, in 1950 on Bouchard's recommendation to Selke to [...] "give the kid a shot", Bernie Geoffrion was given a tryout and eventually joined the Canadiens. Geoffrion won the Calder for rookie of the year and would be near the top of league scoring for years to come. Bouchard commenting on {{the fact that he was}} nominated for captain by his teammates: [...] "I don't agree with management nominating you. I can respond to players, not be a yes-man for the proprietor." [...] He missed a large part of the 1948–49 season after a severe knee injury which threatened his career.

500|$|Rollason began feeling unwell in 1996 {{during an}} eight-week {{assignment}} to the US, {{where she was}} covering that year's Olympic and Paralympic Games. She {{was diagnosed with cancer}} of the colon in August 1997, which she was told had also spread to her liver. She was initially given three months to live, but confounded <b>medical</b> <b>opinion</b> by fighting the disease long after that. She underwent treatment with chemotherapy, but also used a combination of holistic therapies and diet to treat her condition. The cancer later metastasised to her lungs. Rollason continued to work throughout her illness, despite sessions of chemotherapy that left her feeling weak, and cited her work as the thing that had kept her going throughout her treatment. [...] "I stay working because I love it, and because I feel best on the days when I'm busy. I'd far rather work than hang around the house – even though there are days when I can hardly get out of bed." [...] She presented sports bulletins for BBC News, wrote a weekly column about her illness for the Sunday Mirror Magazine and worked on a book about her experience that she hoped would help others diagnosed with the disease. She cited the determination of the many disabled athletes she had got to know through her work as having given her the strength of mind to fight her illness. In October 1998, the BBC aired a special edition of its QED documentary series titled Hope for Helen, which followed her as she underwent a course of treatment. The film earned her much support from the public for her courage. in December 1998, colleagues paid tribute to an emotional-looking Rollason during the BBC's Sports Review of the Year, a compliment that produced mixed feelings for the presenter. She later wrote of the incident, [...] "I felt a mixture of horror, embarrassment and incredible warmth towards my colleagues that they should think of doing this".|$|E
