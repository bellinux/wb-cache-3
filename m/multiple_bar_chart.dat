Primary source of data collection was employed in this study and statistical tools used to analyze the data were the Kruskal-Wallis test and the <b>multiple</b> <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> analysis. The result of this study revealed that the major reason for creative accounting practices in the Nigerian banking industry was to inflate the operating costs to reduce exposure to taxes. It was further found that other key reasons for creative accounting practice in the Nigerian banking industry include: to help maintain or boost the share price by reducing the apparent levels of borrowing, making the company appear subject to less risk and of a good profit trend, to inflate the amount of operating costs in order to reduce exposure to taxes, to report a steady trend of growth in profit, rather than slow volatile profits with a series of dramatic rises and falls, and to effect changes in accounting policies in order to discourage findings faults in the company’s accounting system. It was observed that that creative accounting has significant impact on banks distress in Nigeria and it was further observed that effective measures can curb the practice of creative accounting in the Nigerian banking industry...|$|E

This study assessed the health related impacts of urban heat island in Douala Metropolis in Cameroon. Two land-use classes (resident and commercial) and two land-cover types (paved and green surfaces) were used for the selection of the sample sites using purposive sampling technique. Two hundred and fifty questionnaires were distributed and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics such as <b>multiple</b> and simple <b>bar</b> <b>charts,</b> tables, graphs, central tendency, running mean and spearman’s rank correlation. The result revealed that the people of Douala are always in discomfort the climate usually in the form of heat stress, stroke, crumps, exhaustion, fatigue, headache, nausea, fainting and even death. The result equally showed a strong relationship between the land-use/cover and heat related symptoms...|$|R
50|$|Bar graphs {{can also}} be used for more complex {{comparisons}} of data with grouped <b>bar</b> <b>charts</b> and stacked <b>bar</b> <b>charts.</b> In a grouped <b>bar</b> <b>chart,</b> for each categorical group there are two or more bars. These bars are color-coded to represent a particular grouping. For example, a business owner with two stores might make a grouped <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> with different colored bars to represent each store: the horizontal axis would show the months of the year and the vertical axis would show the revenue. Alternatively, a stacked <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> could be used. The stacked <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> stacks <b>bars</b> that represent different groups on top of each other. The height of the resulting bar shows the combined result of the groups. However, stacked <b>bar</b> <b>charts</b> are not suited to datasets where some groups have negative values. In such cases, grouped <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> are preferable.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Bar</b> <b>charts</b> {{are common}} data {{representations}} in {{scientific and technical}} papers. In order to recognize the printed bar charst, we present a new Hough based <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> recognition algorithm which combines syntactic analysis into segmentation. We first detect the most salient feature in any <b>bar</b> <b>chart,</b> <b>bar</b> patterns, using syntactic analysis in the Hough domain. Then we group text primitives according to their centroids distribution in the Hough space. Finally, we interweave the two extracting processes to refine the recognition results. Our recognition algorithm is not dependent heavily on a priori knowledge and can recognize <b>bar</b> <b>charts</b> lying in arbitrary directions, such as oblique or skewed <b>bar</b> <b>charts,</b> or even hand-drawn <b>bar</b> <b>charts.</b> ...|$|R

The paper discusses the kinds of communicative signals present in grouped <b>bar</b> <b>charts</b> and an ACT-R model for computationalizing one important communicative signal, the relative effort involved in performing the perceptual tasks necessary for the recognition.

40|$|Basic <b>bar</b> <b>charts</b> {{have been}} {{commonly}} available, but they only show highly aggregated data. Finding the valuable information {{hidden in the}} data {{is essential to the}} success of business. We describe a new visualization technique called pixel <b>bar</b> <b>charts,</b> which are derived from regular <b>bar</b> <b>charts.</b> The basic idea of a pixel <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> is to present all data values directly instead of aggregating them into a few data values. Pixel <b>bar</b> <b>charts</b> provide data distribution and exceptions besides aggregated data. The approach is to represent each data item (e. g. a business transaction) by a single pixel in the <b>bar</b> <b>chart.</b> The attribute of each data item is encoded into the pixel color and can be accessed and drilled down to the detail information as needed. Different color mappings are used to represent multiple attributes. This technique has been prototyped in three business service applications [...] Business Operation Analysis, Sales Analysis, and Service Level Agreement Analysis at Hewlett Packard Laboratories. Our applications show the wide applicability and usefulness of this new idea...|$|R
40|$|The Allen Brain Atlas-Driven Visualizations (ABADV) is a {{publicly}} accessible web-based tool created to retrieve and visualize expression energy {{data from the}} Allen Brain Atlas (ABA) across multiple genes and brain structures. Though the ABA offers their own search engine and software for researchers to view their growing collection of online public data sets, including extensive gene expression and neuroanatomical data from human and mouse brain, many of their tools {{limit the amount of}} genes and brain structures researchers can view at once. To complement their work, ABADV generates <b>multiple</b> pie <b>charts,</b> <b>bar</b> <b>charts</b> and heat maps of expression energy values for any given set of genes and brain structures. Such a suite of free and easy-to-understand visualizations allows for easy comparison of gene expression across multiple brain areas. In addition, each visualization links back to the ABA so researchers may view a summary of the experimental detail. ABADV is currently supported on modern web browsers and is compatible with expression energy data from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas in situ hybridization data. By creating this web application, researchers can immediately obtain and survey numerous amounts of expression energy data from the ABA, which they can then use to supplement their work or perform meta-analysis. In the future, we hope to enable ABADV across multiple data resources. © 2014 Zaldivarand Krichmar...|$|R

40|$|The {{synthetic}} {{double sampling}} (SDS) (X) over <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> comprises the double sampling (DS) (X) over bar and conforming run length (CRL) sub-charts. The SDS (X) over <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> {{has been studied}} under the assumption of known process parameters in the literature. Nevertheless, in practice, process parameters are usually unknown and are estimated from an in-control Phase I dataset. This paper investigates {{the performance of the}} SDS (X) over <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> with estimated process parameters, in terms of the average run length (ARL), average number of observations to signal (ANOS) and standard deviation of the run length (SDRL). The performance of the SDS (X) over <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> with estimated process parameters by minimizing the out-of-control ARL and the out-of-control ANOS is compared with the corresponding chart's performance with known process parameters. In addition, the minimum number of Phase I samples required by the SDS (X) over <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> with estimated process parameters so that it has approximately the same in-control ARL and ANOS performances as the chart with known process parameters is studied. The ARL, ANOS and SDRL properties of the SDS (X) over <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> with estimated process parameters differ significantly from that of the chart with known process parameters. Therefore, suitable optimal charting parameters are introduced so that the SDS (X) over <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> with estimated process parameters has an adequate performance as its known process parameters counterpart without having to use large number of Phase I samples and sample size...|$|R

40|$|The double {{sampling}} (DS) X <b>bar</b> <b>chart,</b> {{one of the}} most widely-used charting methods, is superior for detecting small and moderate shifts in the process mean. In a right skewed run length distribution, the median run length (MRL) provides a more credible representation of the central tendency than the average run length (ARL), as the mean is greater than the median. In this paper, therefore, MRL is used as the performance criterion instead of the traditional ARL. Generally, the performance of the DS X <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> is investigated under the assumption of known process parameters. In practice, these parameters are usually estimated from an in-control reference Phase-I dataset. Since the performance of the DS X <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> is significantly affected by estimation errors, we study the effects of parameter estimation on the MRL-based DS X <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> when the in-control average sample size is minimised. This study reveals that more than 80 samples are required for the MRL-based DS X <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> with estimated parameters to perform more favourably than the corresponding chart with known parameters...|$|R

DESCRIPTION DATAPLOT can draw a trace as a character or plot symbol at each point, as a connected line, as a spike from the point to a base, as a bar from the plot point to a base, or as some combination of the above. The choice {{is determined by the}} BAR, SPIKE, CHARACTER, and LINE commands. The switches for these commands work independently so that a plot point can be any combination of these (or even none of them). The BAR switch is most commonly used to generate <b>bar</b> <b>charts.</b> The following types of <b>bar</b> <b>charts</b> are commonly used in business and presentation graphics: 1. Standard <b>bar</b> <b>charts</b> (a <b>bar</b> is drawn from the data point to the X axis); 2. Grouped <b>bar</b> <b>charts</b> (<b>bars</b> are drawn for 2 or more groups of data); 3. Stacked (or divided) <b>bar</b> <b>charts</b> (the <b>bar</b> is divided into several intervals). All of these formats are possible using DATAPLOT. At least one example of each of these formats is given in the PROGRAM section. DATAPLOT provides commands to control the various aspects of the bar (see the RELATED COMMANDS section). Many of these are also demonstrated with the sample programs. Many analysts prefer that <b>bar</b> <b>charts</b> be drawn vertically rather than horizontally.

40|$|Plagiarism can be {{considered}} one of the electronic crimes and intellectual thefts, which has become one of educational challenges of research institutions. One form to represent quantitative information is charts such as line and <b>bar</b> <b>chart,</b> which can formulate the information in info-graphic form. The extraction of features of <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> is an essential process to get the data from images. Some techniques presented by researchers focused on the graphical part rather than text itself, such as Hough Transform and Learning Based method. In this study, ten features of <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> images are utilized to detect and find the proportion of similarity between the charts. Some of these features can be directly extracted by OCR, while others demand finding the relationship between the text part and the graphic part to extract the data such as the real values for each bar in images. The new technique which introduced in this research can extract three values of each bar namely Start, End and Exact values depending on horizontal and vertical lines of the <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> image. In addition, the Word 2 -gram and Euclidean distance methods are used to detect and find the plagiarism. Experimental results show the ability of the system to detect plagiarism for ten possible patterns of <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> plagiarisms. The performance of the system is evaluated depending on overlapping features and precision and recall. The experimental results show the ability of the system to detect not only copy and paste data of bars, but also restructuring and summarization of captions of image as well as modifications to data of <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> images, such as swapping among bars, changing colors and changing scales of <b>bar</b> <b>chart</b> images...|$|R
