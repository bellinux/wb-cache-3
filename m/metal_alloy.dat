5|$|Manganese is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Mn and atomic number 25. It is not found {{as a free}} element in nature; it is often found in minerals in combination with iron. Manganese is a metal with important industrial <b>metal</b> <b>alloy</b> uses, particularly in stainless steels.|$|E
5|$|The {{contamination}} caused what {{is known}} as a hard alpha inclusion, where a contaminant particle in a <b>metal</b> <b>alloy</b> causes the metal around it to become brittle. The brittle titanium around the impurity then cracked during forging and fell out during final machining, leaving a cavity with microscopic cracks at the edges. For the next 18 years, the cracks all grew slightly each time the engine was powered up and brought to operating temperature and finally broke open, causing the disk to fail.|$|E
5|$|The {{strengthening}} {{effect of}} forming stable metal carbides at the grain boundaries {{and the strong}} increase in corrosion resistance made chromium an important alloying material for steel. The high-speed tool steels contain between 3 and 5% chromium. Stainless steel, the main corrosion-resistant <b>metal</b> <b>alloy,</b> is formed when chromium is added to iron in sufficient concentrations, usually above 11%. For its formation, ferrochromium {{is added to the}} molten iron. Also nickel-based alloys increase in strength due to the formation of discrete, stable metal carbide particles at the grain boundaries. For example, Inconel 718 contains 18.6% chromium. Because of the excellent high-temperature properties of these nickel superalloys, they are used in jet engines and gas turbines in lieu of common structural materials.|$|E

5|$|The {{design of}} the three-cent nickel piece {{remained}} stable throughout its run, and there are few varieties. An overdate is known, 1887/6. The die that struck those coins was originally dated 1886, when no circulation strikes were made. So the die would not be wasted, the Mint altered the last digit from a 6 to a 7; evidence of both numbers is visible. Some 1865 pieces in proof condition display a wreath on the reverse that comes much closer to touching the rim than on later issues. These were most likely pattern coins but they are accepted as issued because the Mint placed them in some 1865 proof sets. Many of the three-cent nickel pieces were not fully struck, and are missing details of the design; {{this is because the}} head of Liberty is directly opposite the III, and the Mint had trouble getting the hard <b>metal</b> <b>alloy</b> to adequately flow to the high points of both sides.|$|E
5|$|With Canada at war for {{the first}} time since its version of the Victoria Cross was created, {{preparations}} for a physical cast of the medal were initiated in 2006, when a committee called the Victoria Cross Production Planning Group was formed under the leadership of the Chancellery of Honours at Rideau Hall. It originally consisted of representatives from the Department of National Defence, Veterans Affairs Canada, and the Office of the Secretary to the Governor General of Canada, and the group later expanded to include individuals from the Department of Canadian Heritage, Natural Resources Canada, and the Royal Canadian Mint, with assistance provided by the Queen and the British Ministry of Defence. Following their research and deliberations, the first Victoria Cross decoration was struck in 2007, as confirmed by Deputy Herald Chancellor Emmanuelle Sajous, and the medal was officially released to the public on 16 May 2008 by Governor General Michaëlle Jean at Rideau Hall. It was one of 20 cast, each of which is composed of three groupings of metals: that of a Russian cannon captured at the siege of Sevastopol (18541855), donated by Queen Elizabeth II; a Confederation Medal, created to mark Canada's confederation in 1867; and a selection of metals from each of Canada's regions. These were cast, rather than struck, continuing the tradition started in the United Kingdom when it was found the <b>metal</b> <b>alloy</b> was too brittle for striking, and finished at the Royal Canadian Mint. The first two were sent to Buckingham Palace for addition to the British Royal Collection and other specimens were kept as part of the Crown Collection at Rideau Hall, as well as at the Department of National Defence, Library and Archives Canada, and the Canadian War Museum.|$|E

Preventing ‘slug’ use required sophisticated measures like tokens with <b>metal</b> <b>alloy</b> centers and electronic token verification devices. To provide better access control, the NYCTA experimented with floor-to-ceiling gates and “high wheel” turnstiles. Prototypes installed at 110th Street/Lexington Avenue station during a “target hardening” trial reduced evasions compared to nearby “control” stations. However, controls consisting entirely of “high-wheels” created draconian, prison-like environments, with detrimental effects on station aesthetics.

40|$|Abstract The {{tribological}} {{characteristics of}} dental <b>metal</b> <b>alloys</b> and zirconia were studied by {{carrying out a}} friction and wear performance test. In this study, a pin-on-disk-type tester was used and dead weight was employed as the normal load applied to the test specimen. The friction coefficient of dental <b>metal</b> <b>alloys</b> was investigated {{in terms of their}} weight and sliding velocity. Microscopic observations were carried out on worn sur-faces of specimens. The results indicated that among all <b>metal</b> <b>alloys,</b> Super-A had the highest friction coefficient. Super-A had the lowest amount of wear among all <b>metal</b> <b>alloys,</b> and the amount of wear increased in the fol-lowing order: Crown & Bridge, Porcelain, and Partial.

Many Stirling cycle heat engines can be run backwards {{to act as a}} refrigerator, and therefore these engines have a niche use in cryogenics. In addition there are other types of cryocoolers such as Gifford-McMahon coolers, Joule-Thomson coolers, pulse-tube refrigerators and, for temperatures between 2 mK and 500 mK, dilution refrigerators.|$|E
25|$|Zeppelin {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{aeronautical}} pioneers to apply stringent scientific principals to the design of aircraft, focusing on issues like power-to-weight ratios of engines and using the then new <b>metal</b> <b>alloy</b> aluminium for structural components. Zeppelin heard of the success in Russia of Igor Sikorsky's pioneering 4-engined Le Grand and Ilya Muromets aircraft. From the outbreak of war in 1914 the 4-engined Ilya Muromets class of aircraft were used as heavy bombers. The German government saw the potential for large strategic bombers and issued a design standard which was used by several manufacturers to produce Riesenflugzeuge ("Giant Aircraft") or R-Planes. The most successful design and manufacturing company of R-Planes was Zeppelin which was also the only company to manufacture them in series production, the R-VI.|$|E
25|$|Dental amalgam {{has had a}} {{long history}} and global impact. It was first {{introduced}} in the Chinese materia medica of Su Kung in 659 A.D. during the Tang Dynasty. In Europe, Johannes Stockerus, a municipal physician in Ulm, Germany, recommended amalgam as a filling material as early as 1528. In 1818, Parisian physician Louis Nicolas Regnart added one-tenth by weight of mercury to the fusable metals used as fillings at the time to create a temporarily soft <b>metal</b> <b>alloy</b> at room temperature. Thus, amalgam (an alloy of mercury with another metal or metals, from the French word amalgame) was invented. This was further perfected in 1826, when Auguste Taveau of Paris used a silver paste made from mixing French silver-tin coins with mercury, which offered more plasticity and a quicker setting time. In Europe, prior to 1818, carious teeth were either filled with a melted metal, usually gold or silver (which would often lead to death of the nerve of the tooth from thermal trauma), or the tooth would be extracted.|$|E

All the earrings we examined leached below 0. 5 µg/cm 2 /week, the upper limit of European Union (EU) regulation, but the other <b>metal</b> <b>alloys</b> leached a much higher amount of Ni than the limit. Likewise, all the earrings we examined contained less than 0. 05 % Ni (500 µg/g), the upper limit of EU regulation, but the other <b>metal</b> <b>alloys</b> exceeded this limit. Twenty Ni-sensitive subjects, who were patch-tested with various concentrations of Ni sulphate, showed positive reactions to 5 % and 1 % Ni sulphate, 10 subjects showed positive reactions to 0. 01 %, and the most sensitive subject showed reaction even to 0. 0001 %. The subjects in this study were more sensitive to Ni than those in the previous studies done in Europe. Taken together, strictly regulating the Ni-containing alloys that are made in Korea is needed to lower the occurrence of Ni-induced ACD...|$|R

25|$|The {{earthquake}} {{was felt}} sharply in New England, though the date recorded {{for the event}} was 26 January 1663, as New England was using the Julian calendar at the time. A church record entry made by Reverend S. Danforth from Roxbury, Massachusetts (~ 600km from the CSZ) indicated the initial shock was felt around 6 pm that evening and several more shocks followed the next morning. On the shores of Massachusetts Bay, the tops of chimneys were broken on houses and pewter (a malleable <b>metal</b> <b>alloy)</b> was jarred from shelves. This level of damage {{is consistent with a}} modified Mercalli intensity of VI though this may have been because the early colonials had the capability of producing only relatively weak mortar. Using this MMI value and the distance from the epicenter one can estimate the magnitude of the earthquake using published intensity-attenuation relations. In a June 2011 report on the earthquake that was published in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, John E. Ebel, a professor and researcher at Boston College, used these known relations that apply to earthquakes in northeastern North America and determined the magnitude to be 7.3 – 7.9.|$|E

Purpose: This study evaluated the biocompatibility {{of these two}} base <b>metal</b> <b>alloys</b> in three steps: as cast, after polishing and after porcelain firing cycles. Release of Ni and Cr ions were measured {{to determine if there}} is any difference between these two alloys. Materials and Methods: Samples of two base <b>metal</b> <b>alloys</b> were subjected to Neutral Red Assay, MTT Assay and Trypan Blue for biocompatibility tests. Fibroblast Balb/c 3 T 3 cells were used for cell culture. Samples were contacted directly with cells in 37 &ordm;c and 5 % Co 2 concentration for 72 hours. Teflon samples were used as negative control. ANOVA test was used to compare different groups of two alloys. In addition, the release of Ni and Cr ions in to saline solution was measured by means of atomic absorption spectrometry. Results: MTT and Trypan Blue didn’t show any significant difference between Minalux, VeraBond 2 and Teflon. Neutral Red Assay showed no significant difference between these two base <b>metal</b> <b>alloys</b> but as cast group was higher in cytotoxicity in comparisons with polished and firing groups in both two alloys. Release of Cr ion was non detectable (Cr < 1 PPB) but Ni ion was measured and Ni release was significantly different in as cast groups (P= 0. 007) of two alloys.
