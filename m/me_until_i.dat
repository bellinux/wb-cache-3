5|$|As I sifted the {{evidence}} this became {{less and less}} convincing to <b>me</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> concluded that the opposite was closer to the truth: that the Métis grievances were at least partly of their own making; {{that the government was}} on the verge of resolving them when the Rebellion broke out; That Riel's resort to arms could not be explained by the failure of constitutional agitation and that he received a surprisingly fair trial.|$|E
5|$|There {{came to me}} Bowes, by whom I do {{understand}} that my wife is dead and as he sayeth by a fall {{from a pair of}} stairs. Little other understanding can I have of him.

25|$|My uncle Claude was my {{favorite}} uncle, he was also my godfather. He and I were really, really close. He used {{to take me to}} see cowboy movies all the time when I was a little boy because I loved cowboy movies. He got a cowboy name for me, which was Smokey Joe. So from the time I was three years old if people asked me what my name was I didn't tell them my name was William, I told them my name was Smokey Joe. That's what everyone called <b>me</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> was about 12 and then I dropped the Joe part. I've heard that story about him giving it to me because I'm a light skinned Black man but that's not true.|$|E
25|$|I {{composed}} the fugue first and {{wrote it down}} while I was thinking out the prelude. I only {{hope that you will}} be able to read it, for it is written so very small; and I hope further that you will like it. Another time I shall send you something better for the clavier. My dear Constanze is really the cause of this fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, gave me all the works of Händel and Sebastian Bach to take home with me (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of Händel and Bach. Well, as she has often heard me play fugues out of my head, she asked me if I had ever written any down, and when I said I had not, she scolded me roundly for not recording some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat <b>me</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> wrote down a fugue for her.|$|E

During the Beatles' co-residency with Little Richard at the Star-Club in Hamburg, from April to May 1962, {{he advised}} {{them on the}} proper technique for performing his songs. Of Presley, Lennon said, [...] "Nothing really affected <b>me</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> heard Elvis. If there hadn't been Elvis, there {{would not have been}} the Beatles." ...|$|E

500|$|Kathy Baker saw {{her part}} of Joyce, the {{neighbor}} {{who tries to}} seduce Edward, as a perfect chance to break into comedy. Alan Arkin says when he first read the script, he was [...] "a bit baffled. Nothing really made sense to <b>me</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> saw the sets. Burton's visual imagination is extraordinary". The role of The Inventor was written specifically for Vincent Price, and would ultimately be his final feature film role. Burton commonly watched Price's films as a child, and, after completing Vincent, the two became good friends. Robert Oliveri was cast as Kevin, Kim's younger brother. Nick Carter from The Backstreet Boys plays an uncredited role as the blond boy playing on the Slip 'n Slide as Edward rides in Peg's car through suburbia.|$|E
500|$|Shakur {{converted}} to Roman Catholicism {{as a child}} and attended the all-girls Cathedral High School, for six months before transferring to public high school, which she attended until she dropped out. Shakur is no longer Catholic. She later earned a General Educational Development (GED) with her aunt's help. Often there were few, or no other black students in her high school class. Shakur later wrote teachers seemed surprised when she answered a question in class, as if not expecting black people to be intelligent and engaged, and what she was taught a sugar-coated version of history that ignored the oppression suffered by people of color, especially in the United States. In her autobiography she later wrote: “I didn’t know what a fool they had made out of <b>me</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> grew up and started to read real history”.|$|E
500|$|Because the Fugitive Slave Law {{had made}} the {{northern}} United States a more dangerous place for escaped slaves to remain, many escaped slaves began migrating to Southern Ontario. In December 1851, Tubman guided an unidentified group of 11 fugitives, possibly including the Bowleys and several others she had helped rescue earlier, northward. There is {{evidence to suggest that}} Tubman and her group stopped at the home of abolitionist and former slave Frederick Douglass. In his third autobiography, Douglass wrote: [...] "On one occasion I had eleven fugitives at the same time under my roof, and it was necessary for them to remain with <b>me</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> could collect sufficient money to get them on to Canada. It was the largest number I ever had at any one time, and I had some difficulty in providing so many with food and shelter...." [...] The number of travelers and the time of the visit make it likely that this was Tubman's group.|$|E
60|$|I did {{not disturb}} her. The minutes passed, the light waned <b>until</b> <b>I</b> {{could see her}} no longer, and yet I {{knew that she had}} not moved. The strange sympathy between us kept <b>me</b> silent <b>until</b> <b>I</b> heard her voice calling my name.|$|R

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "In the Dark" [...] was {{directed}} by Ethan Lader. Dev enlisted Lader to make the video as he regularly makes videos for her and The Cataracs. Lader originally contacted her with ideas for the clip, and she soon replied with what she would want in the video. She said, [...] "So we did that back and forth, which he always does with <b>me</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> get my point across. ... and then we met up and we got both of our ideas and feelings across. I wanted to be sexy and dark like the song is, in a really interesting way, and we pulled it off, I think." [...] The video was filmed in Los Angeles, California in late-April 2011, just before Dev joined Usher as the opening act for his OMG Tour. Dev took {{more control over the}} [...] "In the Dark" [...] video than previous video shoots as she used to let the director [...] "take a little bit of control" [...] when she was inexperienced in the process. In an interview with Idolator, Dev elaborated on the video's concept, stating that she wanted a dark feel similar to Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland: [...] "I wanted the video to be sexy as well. I wanted it to reflect all the dark aspects of the song, and initially we went in thinking that we'd have an Alice in Wonderland/Tim Burton type of feel." ...|$|E
500|$|Presley's rise to {{national}} attention in 1956 transformed {{the field of}} popular music and had a huge effect on the broader scope of popular culture. As the catalyst for the cultural revolution that was rock and roll, he was central not only to defining it as a musical genre but in making it a touchstone of youth culture and rebellious attitude. With its racially mixed origins—repeatedly affirmed by Presley—rock and roll's occupation of a central position in mainstream American culture facilitated a new acceptance and appreciation of black culture. In this regard, Little Richard said of Presley, [...] "He was an integrator. Elvis was a blessing. They wouldn't let black music through. He {{opened the door for}} black music." [...] Al Green agreed: [...] "He broke the ice for all of us." [...] President Jimmy Carter remarked on his legacy in 1977: [...] "His music and his personality, fusing the styles of white country and black rhythm and blues, permanently changed the face of American popular culture. His following was immense, and he was a symbol to people the world over of the vitality, rebelliousness, and good humor of his country." [...] Presley also heralded the vastly expanded reach of celebrity in the era of mass communication: at the age of 21, within a year of his first appearance on American network television, {{he was one of the}} most famous people in the world. John Lennon stated that [...] "Before Elvis there was nothing." [...] Lennon also said that [...] "Nothing really affected <b>me</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> heard Elvis. If there hadn't been an Elvis, there wouldn't have been the Beatles." ...|$|E
2500|$|The accusations {{he made in}} Rebuilding American Family Values {{differed}} from a claim which he told Associated Press journalist David Beard in June 1992, where he was confessed there was a link between pediatrics and political activism: People have said, [...] "You've turned your back on pediatrics." [...] I said, [...] "No. It took <b>me</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> was in my 60s to realize that politics {{was a part of}} pediatrics." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1985, Burgess {{published}} Flame into Being: The Life and Work of D. H. Lawrence, {{and while}} discussing Lady Chatterley's Lover in his biography, Burgess compared that novel's notoriety with A Clockwork Orange: [...] "We all {{suffer from the}} popular desire to make the known notorious. The book I am best known for, or only known for, is a novel I am prepared to repudiate: written {{a quarter of a}} century ago, a jeu d'esprit knocked off for money in three weeks, it became known as the raw material for a film which seemed to glorify sex and violence. The film made it easy for readers of the book to misunderstand what it was about, and the misunderstanding will pursue <b>me</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> die. I should not have written the book because of this danger of misinterpretation, and the same may be said of Lawrence and Lady Chatterley's Lover." [...] Burgess has also dismissed A Clockwork Orange as [...] "too didactic to be artistic".|$|E
2500|$|Reflecting on his childhood, Fritzl {{initially}} {{described his}} mother as [...] "the best {{woman in the}} world" [...] and [...] "as strict as it was necessary". Later, he expressed a negative opinion {{of his mother and}} claimed that [...] "she used to beat me, hit <b>me</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> was lying {{in a pool of blood}} on the floor. It left me feeling totally humiliated and weak. My mother was a servant and she used to work hard all her life, I never had a kiss from her, I was never cuddled although I wanted it – I wanted her to be good to me." [...] He also claimed that she called him [...] "a Satan, a criminal, a no-good", that he [...] "had a horrible fear of her". In 1959, after Fritzl had married and bought his house, his mother moved in with them. Over time, their roles reversed, and his mother came to fear him. Eventually, he also admitted he had later locked his mother in the attic and bricked up her window after telling neighbors that she had died, and kept her locked up until her death in 1980. It is unknown how long Fritzl kept his mother locked up in his attic, but newspapers have speculated that it may have been up to 20 years.|$|E
2500|$|Starting on February 23, the Confederate forces reached Albuquerque on March 2 and Santa Fe on March 13, but due {{to their}} slow advance they failed to capture most of the Union {{supplies}} located at these cities. The slow advance also allowed reinforcements from Colorado {{under the command of}} Colonel John Slough to reach Fort Union. Since he had been commissioned colonel before Paul was commissioned the same rank, Slough claimed seniority and took command of the fort. Canby had already ordered Paul to [...] "not move from Fort Union to meet <b>me</b> <b>until</b> <b>I</b> advise you of the route and point of junction." [...] After learning of the change in command, Canby told Slough to [...] "advise me of your plans and movements, that I may cooperate." [...] He also instructed Slough to [...] "harass the enemy by partisan operations. Obstruct his movements and cut off his supplies." [...] Slough interpreted this as an authorization to advance, which he did with [...] men from the fort's garrison. The Union and Confederate forces met at the Battle of Glorieta Pass on March 28. The Confederates were able to push the Union force through the pass, but had to retreat following the destruction of their wagon train, which contained nearly all of their supplies and ammunition. Sibley pulled his army back to Albuquerque to await reinforcements from Texas. Slough, receiving orders from Canby to return immediately to Fort Union, also retreated, fearing a court martial if he disobeyed this order. Once he arrived at the fort, he resigned his commission and returned to Colorado, leaving Lieutenant Colonel Samuel Tappan in command of the regiment and Paul in command of the fort.|$|E
