40|$|Abstract- The {{use of an}} {{autopilot}} {{system in}} radio-controlled aircraft provides new and interesting possibilities. Autonomous aerial reconnaissance {{is one of the}} resulting useful applications. By utilizing <b>Micropilot’s</b> MP 2028 g autopilot system and a customized. 60 sized model airplane, an affordable yet effective UAV reconnaissance system was implemented. Through the use of event driven controls, a wireless video camera tracks a designated target as the UAV approaches and passes the ground object. By creating a tilting camera system, the total time a target is viewed by the camera increases, thus enhancing the accuracy of analysis by operators. To maintain the highest standards of safety, an additional RC receiver, servo, and battery pack facilitate the use of a secondary kill switch. This provides the ability to turn off the engine in the event of autopilot failure, primary RC receiver failure, or power systems failures thus limiting the magnitude of collateral damage. Safety and simplicity of design contributes to a competent and competitive autonomous UAV reconnaissance system. In addition, the project explores a multi-UAV approach utilizing several model aircraft flying in a follow-the-leader formation. The heart of this system, an easy to use GUI application, coordinates the flight of the two aircraft and manages the formation algorithm. Furthermore, the aerial robotics team explored the feasibility of multi-UAV formation...|$|R

This approach will minimize the overall time-to-market requirements, while meeting performance and cost criteria. The optimized four-cylinder system data demonstrated significant progress compared to Phase I results, as well as traditional spark ignition systems. An extensive testing program at the EECL using the GMV- 4 test engine demonstrated that: (1) In general, the engine operated more stable fewer misfires and partial combustion events when using the 3 -hole injectors compared to the 5 -hole injectors used in Phase I. (2) The engine had, in general, a wider range of operation with the 3 -hole injectors. Minimum operational boost levels were approximately 5 ''Hg lower and the minimum pilot quantity that the engine would operate on was roughly cut in half. (3) A successful concept demonstration of engine lube oil pilot injection was performed where the minimum operational boost was reduced by another 5 ''Hg to a boost level of 3 ''Hg; this is, depending on altitude, in the range of boost levels of many blower and piston scavenged low BMEP engines. (4) <b>Micropilot</b> ignition compares very favorably to other ignitions systems.

40|$|Abstract: The {{mathematical}} {{model for the}} estimation of mass transfer coefficients at the extraction of thiols from gasoline with alkaline solutions was established by processing the data proceeding from the laboratory experiment and then from a pilot plant. Three sets of data were obtained, one for each case: the laboratory column with dispersion, the laboratory column equipped with a low specific area packing (ap = 60 m 2 /m 3) and a great porosity (ε= 0. 98) and one in a <b>micropilot</b> size column equipped with Sulzer packing having a much larger specific area (ap = 340 m 2 /m 3) and similar porosity (ε= 0. 96).

40|$|Anaerobic {{treatability}} of {{two different}} wastes that represent the main refuse streams generated by a frozen food factory (fresh vegetable waste and precooked food waste) was assessed. Moreover, the sludge coming from agro-industrial wastewater treatment was codigested with the previously mentioned wastes. Batch tests were performed at different solids content both on the single wastes and on appropriate mixtures of them (also in order to simulate the seasonality of factory production). Both fresh vegetable and precooked food wastes strongly inhibited methanogenesis from unacclimated inoculum at 10 % solids content (undiluted waste) and 5 % solids content (eight- to nine-fold diluted waste), respectively. This was due to their high contents of potassium and lipids, respectively. The aerobic sludge from the wastewater treatment plant did not exert inhibitory effect up to 10 % solids content (undiluted waste). Codigestion of the fresh vegetable waste and sludge (60 and 40 % on wet basis) was more effective {{both in terms of}} rate and yield of methane production with respect to the single wastes (due to dilution and synergic effects). On the other hand, methanogenesis remained strongly inhibited from mixtures containing pre-cooked food waste (at 25 and 45 %, on wet basis). Methanogenesis inhibition could be overcome by a long acclimation period. The results showed that fill-and-draw digestion in a 0. 5 L lab-scale reactor of the fresh vegetable waste and sludge mixture after start up with acclimated inoculum allowed higher methane yields (37 % at high organic load and 57 % at low organic load).

40|$|Thesis (MIng (Electrical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. Unmanned aerial {{vehicles}} (UAVs) {{have been}} used increasingly {{over the past few}} years. Special Forces of various countries utilise these systems successfully in war zones such as Afghanistan. The biggest advantage is rapid information gathering without endangering human lives. The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) also identified the need for local short range aerial reconnaissance and information gathering. A detailed literature survey identified various international players involved in the development of small hand-launch UAV systems. Unfortunately, these overseas systems are too expensive for the SANDF. A new system had to be developed locally to comply with the unique requirements, and budget, of the SANDF. The survey of existing systems provided valuable input to the detailed user requirement statement (URS) for the new South African development. The next step was to build a prototype using off-the-shelf components. Although this aircraft flew and produced good video images, {{it turned out to be}} unreliable. The prototype UAV was then replaced with a standard type model aircraft, purchased from <b>Micropilot.</b> Some modifications were needed to ensure better compliance with the URS. Laboratory and field tests proved that the aircraft can be applied for aerial images, within range of 10 km from the ground control station (GCS). The major limitation is that it can only fly for 40 minutes. Furthermore, the airframe is not robust, needing repairs after only 15 flights. Although the system has shortcomings, it has already been used successfully. It is expected that improved battery technologies and sturdier light-weight materials will further help to improve the system beyond user specifications. Master...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} {{a summary of}} the results of Phase 1 of this contract. The {{objective}} was to evaluate the potential of assist technologies for direct-injected alternative fuel engines vs. glow plug ignition assist. The goal was to demonstrate the feasibility of an ignition system life of 10, 000 hours and a system cost of less than 50 % of the glow plug system, while meeting or exceeding the engine thermal efficiency obtained with the glow plug system. There were three tasks in Phase 1. Under Task 1, a comprehensive review of feasible ignition options for DING engines was completed. The most promising options are: (1) AC and the ''SmartFire'' spark, which are both long-duration, low-power (LDLP) spark systems; (2) the short-duration, high-power (SDHP) spark system; (3) the <b>micropilot</b> injection ignition; and (4) the stratified charge plasma ignition. Efforts concentrated on investigating the AC spark, SmartFire spark, and short-duration/high-power spark systems. Using proprietary pricing information, the authors predicted that the commercial costs for the AC spark, the short-duration/high-power spark and SmartFire spark systems will be comparable (if not less) to the glow plug system. Task 2 involved designing and performing bench tests to determine the criteria for the ignition system and the prototype spark plug for Task 3. The two most important design criteria are the high voltage output requirement of the ignition system and the minimum electrical insulation requirement for the spark plug. Under Task 3, all the necessary hardware for the one-cylinder engine test was designed. The hardware includes modified 3126 cylinder heads, specially designed prototype spark plugs, ignition system electronics, and parts for the system installation.

The second is the <b>MicroPilot</b> MP 2028 (sup g), where its integration into a 36 -inch Zagi airframe (tailless, elevons only configuration) is investigated and is {{the main focus of}} the report. Analytical methods, which include the use of the Advanced Aircraft Analysis software from DARCorp, were used to determine the stability and control derivatives, which were then validated through wind tunnel experiments. From the aerodynamic data, the linear, perturbed equations of motion from steady-state flight conditions may be cast in terms of these derivatives. Using these linear equations, transfer functions for the control and navigation systems were developed and feedback control laws based on Proportional, Integral, and Derivative (PID) control design were developed to control the aircraft. The PID gains may then be programmed into the autopilot software and uploaded to the microprocessor of the autopilot. The Pico-Pilot system was flight tested and shown to be successful in navigating a 12 -inch MAV through a course defined by a number of waypoints {{with a high degree of}} accuracy, and in 20 mph winds. The system, though, showed problems with control authority in the roll and pitch motion of the aircraft: causing oscillations in these directions, but the aircraft maintained its heading while following the prescribed course. Flight tests were performed in remote control mode to evaluate handling, adjust trim, and test data logging for the Zagi with integrated MP 2028 (sup g). Ground testing was performed to test GPS acquisition, data logging, and control response in autonomous mode.
