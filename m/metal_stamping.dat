The handguard is a sheet <b>metal</b> <b>stamping</b> with three rectangular ventilation slots on each side.

The selector lever is placed {{on the right side of}} the receiver, above the trigger, and has three settings: the uppermost [...] "safe" [...] setting disables the trigger and in this position the lever physically blocks the bolt's integral retracting handle; the middle position (marked [...] "АВ") enables fully automatic fire and the lowest position ("ОД") will activate the semi-automatic function of the trigger. An original five-piece anti-bounce device is built into the trigger unit and this functions as a rate reducer, delaying firing until the bolt has settled entirely into battery.|$|E

40|$|The nanoimprinting is a {{potential}} method for submicron scale patterning for various applications, for example, electric, photonic and optical devices. The patterns are created by mechanical deformation of imprint resist using a patterned imprinting mold called also a stamp. The bottle-neck for imprint lithography is availability of the stamps with nanometer-scale features, which are typically fabricated by electron beam lithography. Therefore, patterning of a large stamp is time consuming and expensive. Nanoimprint lithography can offer a low cost and a high through-put method to replicate these imprinting molds. In this work, stamp replication process was developed and demonstrated for three different types of imprint molds. Replication relies on sequential patterning method called step and stamp nanoimprint lithography (SSIL). In this method a small master mold is used to pattern large areas sequentially. The fabricated stamps are hard stamps for thermal imprinting, bendable <b>metal</b> <b>stamps</b> for roll embossing and transparent stamps for UV-imprinting. Silicon is a material often used for fabrication of hard stamps for thermal imprinting. Fabrication process of silicon stamps was demonstrated using both the imprinted resist and lift-off process for pattern transfer into silicon. Bendable <b>metal</b> <b>stamp</b> for roll-to-roll application was fabricated using sequential imprinting to fabricate a polymer mold. The polymer mold was used for fabrication of a nickel copy in subsequent electroplating process. Thus fabricated <b>metal</b> <b>stamp</b> was used in a roll-to-roll imprinting process to transfer the patterns onto a CA film successfully. Polymer stamp for UV-imprinting was fabricated by patterning fluorinated polymer templates using sequential imprinting and a silicon stamp. The imprinted polymer stamp was used succesfully for UV-NIL. In the stamp fabrication process {{the features of the}} silicon stamp were replicated with good fidelity, retaining the original dimensions in all of three stamp types. The results shows, that the sequential imprinting is as {{a potential}} stamp replication method for various applications...|$|R

40|$|Forming {{simulation}} has now {{reached an}} acceptable level of accuracy. It is possible to predict the hardening, the thinning and required forces for sheet <b>metal</b> <b>stamped</b> parts {{and it is also}} possible to predict the geometrical defects such as springback, wrinkling and surface appearance problems. Sheet metal forming can therefore be used in a closed loop to help design of parts and required tools in order to achieve a pre-defined geometry and mechanical performance. The paper presents a practical optimization methodology applied to automotive sheet <b>metal</b> <b>stamped</b> parts. The goal is to automatically optimize tool geometry in order to achieve an optimal part. An optimal part is regarded as a part free of defects. The defects are classified in two categories: material and geometrical. Material defects prevent the forming of the parts which can be {{in the form of a}} premature failure or an excessive wrinkling. The geometrical defects prevent the formed part from being assembled to the body structure and are generally referred as “springback”. In order to establish this optimization methodology, available tools for optimization and automatic geometry modification were coupled to LS-DYNA [1]. A special attention was paid to the definition of the optimization problem: appropriate selection of design variables, definition of the response functions in order to characterize the possible part defects (material or geometrical) and specification of the required physical constraints. The developed methodology will be demonstrated on actual automotive components Keywords...|$|R
