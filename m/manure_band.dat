40|$|Concern over excess {{phosphorus}} (P) {{input and}} loading in some soils of the Canadian prairie region {{has led to}} a need for {{a better understanding of the}} fate of added manure and fertilizer P. Information on the effects of manure application over long term (i. e., years) and short term (i. e., weeks, months) as related to management practices and manure form is still lacking. Knowledge of the P forms and species present in soil following application of manure and inorganic P fertilizers, and linking this to potential P availability and mobility is needed to make sound P management recommendations. The objective of this thesis project was to assess the speciation of soil P in different manures and inorganic fertilizer-amended Saskatchewan soils as affected by time, presence and absence of plants, landscape position, soil type, and management practices including rate and placement. Three studies were conducted (growth chamber and field-based experiments) to study P behavior in soils. These studies closely followed a time scale, beginning with speciation and fate followed over the very short-term (i. e., days to weeks) to a short-term period (i. e., months to a year) following amendment application, and finally the effects of repeated annual manure additions made over the long term (i. e., 11 years). Soils used in this study were loamy textured Brown and Black Chernozems. Solid cattle manure (SCM) and liquid hog manure (LHM) were applied at low and high rates in the very short-term and long-term studies. The low rate of SCM and LHM application was 7. 6 T ha- 1 yr- 1 (dry weight) and 37, 000 L ha- 1 yr- 1, respectively which was equivalent to approximately 100 kg total N ha- 1 yr- 1 application (agronomic N rate). The high rate was four times this amount. Inorganic fertilizer (mono-ammonium phosphate blended with urea) at rate of 54 kg N ha- 1 and 12 kg P ha- 1 and SCM at rate of 60 T ha- 1 were applied in the short-term study. A sequential chemical extraction procedure was used to fractionate P in very short-term and short-term studies and different soil test phosphorus (STP) methods were used to determine effects on the labile P in the long-term study. Changes in P speciation with time and their relative proportions in fertilizered soils were also assessed using the synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy in all studies. This study has revealed that manure, especially SCM elevates labile P over all time frames examined. Over the very short-term (i. e., weeks to a month), P was added as manure tends to remain in labile forms like brushite and adsorbed P that is accessible to plants for uptake. In the <b>manure</b> <b>band</b> (months to a year), manure P was relatively unchanged over a period of months while in the mono-ammonium phosphate (MAP) fertilizer band, adsorbed and Ca-P was readily formed from fertilizer P. Aging over several years (one to eleven years), along with high soil pH and high Ca:P ratio enhanced formation of more stable Ca-P minerals like apatite, especially in SCM amended soil. Overall, the unique combined use of wet chemical analysis and synchrotron-based techniques in this thesis research has improved our understanding of fate and transformation of P added to prairie soils. It is suggested that future studies of fate of applied P in soil also utilize a combination of wet chemical and spectroscopic techniques, as this was shown to be a rewarding approach...|$|E
40|$|The use of tylosin at subtherapeutic {{levels by}} the swine {{industry}} provides selective pressure {{for the development}} of antibiotic resistance in gastrointestinal bacteria. The land application of swine manure to drained agricultural fields might introduce elevated levels of total and tylosin-resistant enterococci, erm genes and tylosin. The goal {{of this study was to}} develop an understanding of the occurrence and transport of total and tylosin-resistant enterococci, erm genes and tylosin in tile-drained chisel plow and no-till agricultural fields that have received multi-year application of liquid swine manure through injection over two growing seasons. Resistance to tylosin in manure, soil and water samples was investigated at the field scale level using phenotypic based (membrane filtration) and genotypic based (qPCR) methods and compared with samples from control plots treated with urea and ammonium nitrate (UAN). Tylosin was quantified using LC-MS/MS. Plots in a corn-soybean rotation were identified for sampling from 2010 - 2012. Soil samples were collected from each manure plot, from both the direct area of injection and from the area between the <b>manure</b> <b>bands</b> and from control plots. Each one-acre plot is drained separately and tile water samples were collected directly from the discharge tile line weekly while the tiles were flowing. The results of this study suggest that tylosin usage has increased the short-term occurrence of total and tylosin-resistant enterococci, erm genes, and tylosin in soils, but has had minimal effect on tile drainage water quality under dryer than average condition...|$|R
40|$|Legume/grass {{cover crop}} {{mixtures}} and sidedress subsurface <b>band</b> <b>manure</b> application are two approaches to improving nitrogen (N) use efficiency in a cover crop-based no-till corn (Zea mays L.) system. The objectives {{of this study}} were to: 1) quantify cover crop biomass and N content in response to different hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) /cereal rye (Secale cereale L.) sown proportions, 2) evaluate the effects of cover crop species proportions and pelletized poultry litter (PPL) application method on residue decomposition, and 3) model the spatio-temporal dynamics of soil inorganic N as influenced by different cover crop residues and subsurface band-applied PPL. Results suggest that cover crop mixtures can accumulate as much biomass as a cereal rye monoculture and as much N as a hairy vetch monoculture, and have decomposition patterns intermediate between those of monocultures.

The frequent response to the residue effect of manure suggests that the benefits may be {{largely due to the}} supplying of small amounts of many nutrients. More response to fertilizers can also be expected when management levels are high. The frequent intercropping of beans with other crops complicates the determination of optimal soil fertility management practices; guidelines are therefore needed, possibly based on the needs of the component crops. The lack of information on the feasibility of extrapolating results from one zone to another is highlighted as well as the need for further research on the use of fertilizers and system sustainability on the continent.

40|$|Several manure use {{options were}} {{analysed}} for profitability using results from research and farmer participatory trials that {{were conducted in}} the small-scale farming sector in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The options analysed for profitability were a) not using any manure b) using aerobically composted (heap stored) manure, c) using manure improved through anaerobic storage (pit-stored), d) different manure application methods i. e. banding, broadcasting and station placement {{and the use of}} manure in combination with inorganic fertiliser. The use of manure provided a marginal rate of return (MRR) of at least 600 % compared to not using manure. The marginal rate of return on manure use was increased significantly by composting manure in pits. Financial benefits obtained from pit- stored manure were much higher {{in the first year of}} manure application compared to those of heap- stored manure. Higher returns from heap- stored manure were obtained in the second and third season after manure application. Overall undiscounted financial benefits for the three years were marginally higher for heap- stored manure. Using a discount rate of 100 % financial benefits from using pit-stored manure were much higher than those of heap stored manure as pit-stored manure provided much higher returns in the first year of application. Higher financial benefits were obtained from supplementing manure with inorganic fertiliser compared to using <b>manure</b> alone. <b>Banding</b> and placing <b>manure</b> on-station (applying the manure to the hill of maize) increased returns from using both pit and heap stored manure.

However, {{the response to}} surface-banding slurry manure on grass N {{after several years of}} application has not been reported. This study compared the effects of commercial fertili-zer with drag-shoe applied dairy slurry on yield, N uptake and soil parameters of a tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) sward in years 7 - 8 of a trial in south-coastal British Columbia, Canada. At equivalent rates of mineral-N, annual grass yield (average of 200 and 2001) was 2 - 3 Mg ha- 1 greater with manure than fer-tilizer whereas at equivalent rate of total-N (400 kg ha- 1) annual yield was 1. 3 mg ha- 1 greater with fertili-zer. N-uptake was 6 and 11 kg ha- 1 greater from manure than from fertilizer at 200 and 400 kg mineral-N ha- 1, respectively, suggesting a relatively small benefit from historical applications of N. Apparent N reco-very for both fertilizer and manure was about 80 and 70 % at 200 and 400 kg mineral-N ha- 1, respectively. Alternating manure/fertilizer (400 kg TAN ha- 1) produced high yield and N-uptake with less applied total-N than manure alone. There was 230, 309 and 519 kg ha- 1 of unrecovered applied N annually (average of 2000 and 2001) for the low manure, alternating and high manure applications, respectively. High manure plots had significant higher total soil N (approximately 1000 kg ha- 1) and available soil P and K, but there was less fall soil NO 3 with manure than with fertilizer. The study indicates that high yields of tall fescue can be maintained by <b>banding</b> slurry <b>manure</b> with or without mineral fertilizer at annual total-N rates of 400 - 600 kg ha- 1 with little risk of ground water contamination but significant amounts of applied N are lost from the system...|$|R
40|$|Livestock manure {{contributes}} considerably {{to global}} emissions of ammonia (NH 3) {{and greenhouse gases}} (GHG), especially methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O). Various measures {{have been developed to}} mitigate these emissions, but most of these focus on one specific gas and/or emission source. Here, we present a meta-analysis and integrated assessment of the effects of mitigation measures on NH 3, CH 4 and (direct and indirect) N 2 O emissions from the whole manure management chain. We analysed the effects of mitigation technologies on NH 3, CH 4 and N 2 O emissions from individual sources statistically using results of 126 published studies. Whole-chain effects on NH 3 and GHG emissions were assessed through scenario analysis. Significant NH 3 reduction efficiencies were observed for (i) housing via lowering the dietary crude protein (CP) content (24 – 65 %, compared to the reference situation), for (ii) external slurry storages via acidification (83 %) and covers of straw (78 %) or artificial films (98 %), for (iii) solid manure storages via compaction and covering (61 %, compared to composting), and for (iv) <b>manure</b> application through <b>band</b> spreading (55 %, compared to surface application), incorporation (70 %) and injection (80 %). Acidification decreased CH 4 emissions from stored slurry by 87 %. Significant increases in N 2 O emissions were found for straw-covered slurry storages (by two orders of magnitude) and manure injection (by 26 – 199 %). These side-effects of straw covers and slurry injection on N 2 O emission were relatively small when considering the total GHG emissions from the manure chain. Lowering the CP content of feed and acidifying slurry are strategies that consistently reduce NH 3 and GHG emissions in the whole chain. Other strategies may reduce emissions of a specific gas or emissions source, by which there is a risk of unwanted trade-offs in the manure management chain. Proper farm-scale combinations of mitigation measures are important to minimize impacts of livestock production on global emissions of NH 3 and GH...|$|R
40|$|In this {{literature}} review, measures {{of reducing the}} ammonia (NH 3) emissions from pig production are described, with focus on systems {{that can be used}} under Swedish conditions. The entire production chain with feed, housing, manure storage and application on the field is described and taken into consideration. However, in order to limit the study, the production of crops for feed is not included. As compared to many other countries, emissions of NH 3 in Swedish pig production are already low, due to low protein levels in the feed, housing systems with a small excretory area, and storage of slurry outside the building. Lowering the crude protein level from 14. 5 % to 12. 5 % would reduce NH 3 emission by 20 % from the pig house. Including fiber in the feed, leads to a shift from nitrogen in the urine towards more nitrogen in the faeces. In combination with removing the manure daily from the pig house, this might give opportunities for reducing NH 3 emissions. A reduction in NH 3 emission of up to 50 % might be possible. However, using fiber leads to higher methane (CH 4) emissions (from animal and housing), and therefore this should be combined with biogas production. More research is needed in this field. Adding acids or salts to the feed could reduce NH 3 emission by up to 40 %, while also improving feed conversion efficiency. Of course, good practice when preparing the feed must be followed. By applying multi-phase feeding and feeding according to the sex of the animals, NH 3 emissions could be reduced by 5 - 15 %. By reducing feed spillage, offering a good environment for the pigs and maintaining good pig health, nitrogen losses could also be reduced with about 5 – 15 %. The importance of having clean pens is also discussed in {{this literature}} survey. Swedish housing systems, having a relatively high percentage of solid flooring (with some bedding) and a small excretory area in the pen, provides an opportunity for reducing NH 3 emissions from the housing system. However, one prerequisite for this is that the pigs keep the pens clean, and therefore the room temperature should not be too high. This means that during hot periods, the air has to be conditioned before entering the pig house, e. g., by taking in the air via channels under the building. Removing manure daily by means of scrapers (reduction up to 40 %) and cooling the manure under the slats (reduction up to 50 %) are measures that are already implemented in Swedish pig production. The effect of air temperature, air flow and ventilation system are also discussed. Cleaning the exhaust air using bio-filters (up to 65 % reduction), bio-scrubbers (up to 70 % reduction) and chemical scrubbers (up to 96 % reduction) is also an option. By only purifying the exhaust air from the manure channels, the costs for this method can be reduced substantially. The emissions of CH 4 and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) from the housing system are also discussed. Removal of the manure under the slats appears to reduce CH 4 emission from the building. The use of deep-litter bedding may in many cases result in high N 2 O emissions. More research is needed in this field. Treating the manure with sulphuric acid, in combination with aeration and re-circulation in the pig house, can reduce NH 3 emissions by up to 70 %. Pumping slurry between different compartments in a pig house is not allowed according to the Swedish Welfare Legislation. Therefore it is not certain that the acidification of slurry, inside the pig house, can be applied in Sweden. Anaerobic treatment of biogas production, as another treatment of manure, may not reduce NH 3 emissions when storing and spreading the manure, but it results in increasing the nitrogen availability for the crops. In that way nitrogen losses can be reduced since less nitrogen has to be spread per hectare. Besides, biogas production reduces odour problems as well as emissions of green house gas (GHG) by the production of energy and lower CH 4 emissions. Aerobic treatment of manure, can reduce the emissions of NH 3 and GHG. However, poorly controlled aeration processes can have the opposite effect. Storage of slurry in a tank having a cover lid has been pointed out in many investigations, to be the easiest and most effective way of reducing NH 3 and CH 4 emissions. The straw used for fattening pigs is mainly consumed by the pigs, and it is rare that a naturally stable crust will be developed on the slurry. However, within piglet production a crust on the slurry tank is often found. This crust can cause problems when the slurry tank is covered. Technical solutions have to be developed to solve this problem. On pig farms, the main crops are cereals, and the slurry is mainly applied either in the spring during tillage work, or band spread in the early summer on growing cereals. Incorporation of the slurry, e. g., by harrowing in the spring, effectively reduces the NH 3 losses if it takes place as soon as possible after spreading, preferably directly or at least within 4 hours after spreading. Another possibility is to band spread the slurry onto the growing cereals because the canopy provides a microclimate which reduces the NH 3 losses, as compared to spreading on a bare field. Late application during the vegetation period or spreading before the autumn sowing, often results in lower nitrogen utilization by the plants, and thereby higher risks of nitrogen leakage. Due to interactions between different sources on a farm, reduction in NH 3 emission from the individual sections of the livestock production system cannot be simply added to give the net reduction in emission from the total system. Thus a whole farm system approach is needed for devising control strategies for reducing NH 3 emission. Four scenarios were evaluated in this report. Scenario 1 consists of: Reduction of the crude protein in the feed from 14. 5 % to 12. 5 %, relatively simple technique inside the pig house to reduce NH 3 emission, covering the slurry tank and new technique when spreading manure. Scenario 2 consists of: Using biproducts from industry (16. 5 % crude protein instead of 14. 5 %) and cleaning of exhausting air, covering the slurry tank and new technique when spreading manure. Scenario 3 comprises conditions similar to those of Scenario 1, including high dietary feed fiber content in combination with biogas production. Scenario 4 comprises conditions similar to those of Scenario 2, including high dietary feed fiber content and in combination with biogas production. Preliminary calculations indicate that the scenarios may reduce emissions by 47 - 68 %. It {{should be pointed out that}} the calculations are still very uncertain. The calculations show that Scenario 3 appears to be the most effective way of reducing NH 3 emissions. So the combination of using low protein feed with high fiber content together with the production of biogas appears to be a promising method for future development. Even Scenario 1, which used only simple techniques, has a significant result: lowering the protein content affects the entire chain from feed to the field. From the literature review, it can be concluded that one should consider whole farm systems when trying to reduce NH 3 emissions. Having a roof on the <b>manure</b> storage, using <b>band</b> spreading together with incorporation, e. g. harrowing, within a few hours after spreading, are the most important and easiest ways of reducing NH 3 losses. When discussing the method of animal keeping, feeding and housing, a low protein level in the feed has a positive effect along the entire production chain, and appears to be the most effective means of reducing NH 3 emissions. Using more fiber or acids/salts in the feed will reduce the NH 3 emission even more. When biproducts from industry are used in the pig feed, cleaning the exhausting air from the manure channel may be an option. More research is needed before recommendations can be given...|$|R
