5|$|All {{of these}} cerebellum-like {{structures}} {{appear to be}} primarily sensory-related rather than motor-related. All of them have granule cells {{that give rise to}} parallel fibers that connect to Purkinje-like neurons with modifiable synapses, but none have climbing fibers comparable to those of the cerebellum—instead they receive direct input from peripheral sensory organs. None has a demonstrated function, but the most influential speculation is that they serve to transform sensory inputs in some sophisticated way, perhaps to compensate for changes in body posture. In fact, James M. Bower and others have argued, partly {{on the basis of these}} structures and partly on the basis of cerebellar studies, that the cerebellum itself is fundamentally a sensory structure, and that it contributes to motor control by moving the body in a way that controls the resulting sensory signals. Despite Bower's viewpoint, there is also strong evidence that the cerebellum directly influences <b>motor</b> <b>output</b> in mammals.|$|E
25|$|Both single neurons {{and groups}} of neurons can {{generate}} oscillatory activity spontaneously. In addition, they may show oscillatory responses to perceptual input or <b>motor</b> <b>output.</b> Some types of neurons will fire rhythmically {{in the absence of}} any synaptic input. Likewise, brain-wide activity reveals oscillatory activity while subjects do not engage in any activity, so-called resting-state activity. These ongoing rhythms can change in different ways in response to perceptual input or <b>motor</b> <b>output.</b> Oscillatory activity may respond by increases or decreases in frequency and amplitude or show a temporary interruption, which is referred to as phase resetting. In addition, external activity may not interact with ongoing activity at all, resulting in an additive response.|$|E

25|$|When {{used as a}} rehabilitative intervention, {{particularly}} for respiration and walking, intermittent hypoxia typically works by using long-term facilitation (LTF). LTF, which is synonymous to long-term potentiation, occurs when there are long-term increases in synaptic strength due to synaptic plasticity. In the case of intermittent hypoxia, these increases in synaptic strength result in increased <b>motor</b> <b>output.</b>|$|E
25|$|Oscillatory rhythms at 10Hz {{have been}} {{recorded}} in a brain area called the inferior olive, which {{is associated with the}} cerebellum. These oscillations are also observed in <b>motor</b> <b>output</b> of physiological tremor and when performing slow finger movements. These findings may indicate that the human brain controls continuous movements intermittently. In support, it was shown that these movement discontinuities are directly correlated to oscillatory activity in a cerebello-thalamo-cortical loop, which may represent a neural mechanism for the intermittent motor control.|$|E
25|$|Large brushes are desired for {{a larger}} brush contact area to {{maximize}} <b>motor</b> <b>output,</b> but small brushes are desired for low mass to maximize {{the speed at which}} the motor can run without the brushes excessively bouncing and sparking. (Small brushes are also desirable for lower cost.) Stiffer brush springs {{can also be used to}} make brushes of a given mass work at a higher speed, but at the cost of greater friction losses (lower efficiency) and accelerated brush and commutator wear. Therefore, DC motor brush design entails a trade-off between output power, speed, and efficiency/wear.|$|E

40|$|Tourette {{syndrome}} (TS) is {{a neurological}} disorder characterized by vocal and motor tics.

We review evidence that increased control over <b>motor</b> <b>outputs,</b> including the suppression of tics, may develop during adolescence in TS and be accompanied by compensatory, neuromodulatory, alterations in brain structure and function.

40|$|In the CNS, {{activity}} of individual neurons {{has a small}} but quantifiable relationship to sensory representations and <b>motor</b> <b>outputs.</b> Coactivation of a few 10 s to 100 s of neurons can code sensory inputs and behavioral task performance within psychophysical limits. However, {{in a sea of}} sensory inputs and demand for complex <b>motor</b> <b>outputs</b> how is the {{activity of}} such small subpopulations of neurons organized? Two theories dominate in this respect: increases in spike rate (rate coding) and sharpening of the coincidence of spiking in active neurons (temporal coding). Both have computational advantages and are far from mutually exclusive. Here, we review evidence for a bias in neuronal circuits toward temporal coding and the coexistence of rate and temporal coding during population rhythm generation. The coincident expression of multiple types of gamma rhythm in sensory cortex suggests a mechanistic substrate for combining rate and temporal codes on the basis of stimulus strength. In determining how the brain codes for sensory inputs and <b>motor</b> <b>outputs</b> two types of measurement dominate the literature: the outputs (action potentials or units) of identified neurons or groups thereof and the local mean synaptic inputs (local-, faror extracranial field potentials).

25|$|Pseudobulbar affect is a {{condition}} that occurs secondary to neurological disease or brain injury, and is thought to result from disruptions of neural networks that control the generation and regulation of <b>motor</b> <b>output</b> of emotions. PBA is most commonly observed in people with neurologic injuries such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and stroke, and neurologic diseases such as dementias including Alzheimer's disease, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Lyme disease, PANDAS in children and adults, and Parkinson's disease (PD).

25|$|At a {{symptomatic}} level, {{sleep is}} characterized by lack of reactivity to sensory inputs, low <b>motor</b> <b>output,</b> diminished conscious awareness and rapid reversibility to wakefulness. However, to translate these into a biological definition is difficult because no single pathway in the brain {{is responsible for the}} generation and regulation of sleep. One of the earliest proposals was to define sleep as the deactivation of the cerebral cortex and the thalamus because of near lack of response to sensory inputs during sleep. However, this was invalidated because both regions are active in some phases of sleep. In fact, it appears that the thalamus is only deactivated in the sense of transmitting sensory information to the cortex.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s, Roger Sperry {{developed}} split-brain preparations in non-human primates {{that emphasized}} the importance of information transfer that occurred in these neocortical connections. For example, learning on simple tasks, if restricted in sensory input and <b>motor</b> <b>output</b> to one hemisphere of a split-brain animal, would not transfer to the other hemisphere. The right brain has no idea what the left brain is up to, if these specific connections are cut. Those experiments were followed by tests on human beings with epilepsy who had undergone split-brain surgery, which established that the neocortical connections between hemispheres are the principal route for cognition to transfer {{from one side of the}} brain to another. These experiments also formed the modern basis for lateralization of function in the human brain.|$|E
30|$|A {{fundamental}} question in neuroscience {{is to understand}} the relation between genes, brains and behaviour: Genes encode hard-wired neuronal circuits in the nervous system.

50|$|In the {{traditional}} computational approach, representations {{are viewed as}} static structures of discrete symbols. Cognition takes place by transforming static symbol structures in discrete, sequential steps.

50|$|The cerebellum, and {{especially}} the cerebellar cortex, is critical for coordinating <b>motor</b> <b>outputs</b> during skilled tasks, {{as well as the}} process of stabilizing newly formed motor skills. Damage to the cerebellum can occur through a number of causes including trauma, alcoholism, chronic degenerative diseases such as olivopontocerebellar atrophy, and genetic developmental disorders.|$|R
25|$|Reduced partial {{pressures}} of {{oxygen in the}} arteries due to intermittent hypoxia are sensed by and stimulate the carotid body, a chemoafferent receptor. The activated carotid body triggers the release of serotonin that attach to serotonin receptors {{on the surface of}} motoneurons, such as the phrenic motoneuron in the case of respiratory recovery. This signal transduction pathway then uses downstream molecules such as TrkB, BDNF, and PKA to increase the synaptic output of the involved motor neuron which in turn increases the <b>motor</b> <b>output</b> of the involved muscles and, thus, decreases functional impairment. As the amount of intermittent hypoxia changes the amount of serotonin release and, as a result, the amount of LTF, this process exhibits metaplasticity. Metaplasticity occurs when the LTF is itself plastic or variable.|$|E
25|$|Neural {{oscillations}} {{were observed}} by researchers {{as early as}} 1924 (by Hans Berger). More than 50 years later, intrinsic oscillatory behavior was encountered in vertebrate neurons, but its functional role is still not fully understood. The possible roles of neural oscillations include feature binding, information transfer mechanisms and the generation of rhythmic <b>motor</b> <b>output.</b> Over the last decades more insight has been gained, especially with advances in brain imaging. A major area of research in neuroscience involves determining how oscillations are generated and what their roles are. Oscillatory activity in the brain is widely observed {{at different levels of}} organization and is thought to {{play a key role in}} processing neural information. Numerous experimental studies support a functional role of neural oscillations; a unified interpretation, however, is still lacking.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{pathways}} involving basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry, both {{of which}} originate in the neostriatum. The direct pathway projects to the internal globus pallidus (GPi) and to the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). These projections are inhibitory and {{have been found to}} utilize both GABA and substance P. The indirect pathway, which projects to the globus pallidus external (GPe), is also inhibitory and uses GABA and enkephalin. The GPe projects to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), which then projects back to the GPi and GPe via excitatory, glutaminergic pathways. Excitation of the direct pathway leads to disinhibition of the GABAergic neurons of the GPi/SNr, ultimately resulting in activation of thalamic neurons and excitation of cortical neurons. In contrast, activation of the indirect pathway stimulates the inhibitory striatal GABA/enkephalin projection, resulting in suppression of GABAerigc neuronal activity. This, in turn, causes disinhibition of the STN excitatory outputs, thus triggering the GPi/SNr inhibitory projections to the thalamus and decreased activation of cortical neurons. While deregulation of either of these pathways can disturb <b>motor</b> <b>output,</b> hyperkinesia is thought to result from overactivity of the direct pathway and decreased activity from the indirect pathway.|$|E

25|$|Type 1 episodic ataxia (EA1) is {{characterized}} by attacks of generalized ataxia induced by emotion or stress, with myokymia both during and between attacks. This disorder {{is also known as}} episodic ataxia with myokymia (EAM), hereditary paroxysmal ataxia with neuromyotonia and Isaacs-Mertens syndrome. Onset of EA1 occurs during early childhood to adolescence and persists throughout the patient's life. Attacks last from seconds to minutes. Mutations of the gene KCNA1, which encodes the voltage-gated potassium channel KV1.1, are responsible for this subtype of episodic ataxia. KV1.1 is expressed heavily in basket cells and interneurons that form GABAergic synapses on Purkinje cells. The channels aid in the repolarization phase of action potentials, thus affecting inhibitory input into Purkinje cells and, thereby, all <b>motor</b> <b>output</b> from the cerebellum. EA1 {{is an example of a}} synaptopathy. There are currently 17 KV1.1 mutations associated with EA1, Table 1 and Figure 1. 15 of these mutations have been at least partly characterized in cell culture based electrophysiological assays wherein 14 of these 15 mutations have demonstrated drastic alterations in channel function. As described in Table 1, most of the known EA1 associated mutations result in a drastic decrease in the amount of current through KV1.1 channels. Furthermore, these channels tend to activate at more positive potentials and slower rates, demonstrated by positive shifts in their V½ values and slower τ activation time constants, respectively. Some of these mutations, moreover, produce channels that deactivate at faster rates (deactivation τ), which would also result in decreased current through these channels. While these biophysical changes in channel properties likely underlie some of the decrease in current observed in experiments, many mutations also seem to result in misfolded or otherwise mistrafficked channels, which is likely to be the major cause of dysfunction and disease pathogenesis. It is assumed, though not yet proven, that decrease in KV1.1 mediated current leads to prolonged action potentials in interneurons and basket cells. As these cells are important in the regulation of Purkinje cell activity, it is likely that this results increased and aberrant inhibitory input into Purkinje cells and, thus, disrupted Purkinje cell firing and cerebellum output.|$|E
500|$|A {{particular}} {{conceptual model}} of the motor circuit and its alteration with PD has been of great influence since 1980, although some limitations have been pointed out which have led to modifications. In this model, the basal ganglia normally exert a constant inhibitory influence {{on a wide range}} of motor systems, preventing them from becoming active at inappropriate times. When a decision is made to perform a particular action, inhibition is reduced for the required motor system, thereby releasing it for activation. Dopamine acts to facilitate this release of inhibition, so high levels of dopamine function tend to promote motor activity, while low levels of dopamine function, such as occur in PD, demand greater exertions of effort for any given movement. Thus, the net effect of dopamine depletion is to produce hypokinesia, an overall reduction in <b>motor</b> <b>output.</b> [...] Drugs that are used to treat PD, conversely, may produce excessive dopamine activity, allowing motor systems to be activated at inappropriate times and thereby producing dyskinesias.|$|E

40|$|The {{spinal cord}} {{represents}} {{the final stage}} of generating motor behaviors, where descending commands or sensory inputs must be transformed into behaviorally-relevant pattern of motor neuron activity. Networks along the rostrocaudal axis of the spinal cord regulate diverse motor behaviors such as respiration, forelimb, trunk, and hindlimb movements, mediated by stringent innervations of motor neurons to muscle fibers. However, how the network properties of the central nervous system enable these diverse <b>motor</b> <b>outputs</b> remains elusive. To address this question, we set out to investigate whether a cardinal class of spinal cord neurons are diversified in diffeernt spinal segment. This dissertation describes a series of original work that aims to elucidate the diversification of spinal neurons in different segments of the spinal cord. The first chapter is an introduction into the developmental processes of spinal cord development. The second chapter proceeds from this review to explore whether spinal neurons are further diversified in different spinal segments to underlie distinct network operation and <b>motor</b> <b>outputs.</b> In particular, we studied V 2 a interneurons as a model to address this question. Using viral tracing and RNA-sequencing, we uncovered how V 2 a interneurons exhibit distinct anatomical connectivity schemes and distinct genetic signatures in forelimb regulating- and hidnlimb regulating-segments of the spinal cord. It is my hope that our studies establish a framework of how diversification of spinal neurons along the rostrocaudal axis underlies distinct intrinsic network properties in different spinal segments that ultimately contribute to diverse <b>motor</b> <b>outputs</b> that the spinal cord regulates...|$|R
