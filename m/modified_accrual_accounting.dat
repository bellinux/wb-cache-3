40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the current usage of cost {{accounting}} methodology in Croatian public hospitals through conducted empirical research and to provide opinions of accountants and financial officers regarding possible implementation of cost accounting methodology in public hospitals. In the paper, the authors analyze the accounting system in Croatian public hospitals, identifying the flaws of the current accounting system with regard to the recording and allocation of costs. National healthcare systems of different European countries provide a theoretical background for the usage of <b>accrual</b> <b>accounting</b> basis and cost accounting methodologies, showing better governance and financial sustainability of public hospitals which have introduced cost accounting methodology. The conducted empirical research shows that accountants and financial officers believe that the healthcare system in Croatia is ready for a change in the current accounting system based on the <b>modified</b> <b>accrual</b> basis through the implementation of <b>accrual</b> <b>accounting</b> basis and full costing approach to cost allocation.

The shift from cash basis <b>accounting</b> to <b>accrual</b> <b>accounting</b> represents the fiscal management change in the Malaysian public sector.

In order to ensure the implementation success of the <b>accrual</b> <b>accounting</b> system, there is a need to examine the acceptance level of <b>accrual</b> <b>accounting</b> system among the personnel in the public sector.

40|$|In 1988 the New South Wales (NSW) Government was {{the first}} in Australia, and amongst the first in the world, to commit to {{implement}} <b>accrual</b> <b>accounting</b> for its General Government Sector. Subsequently, <b>accrual</b> <b>accounting</b> has been implemented by numerous governments, including all Australian governments. This thesis examines why the NSW Government decided to implement <b>accrual</b> <b>accounting</b> and the impact of this accounting change on decision making within a General Government Sector organisation. The historical account is derived from a combination of archival and oral data sources whilst an organisational learning theoretical frame is used in a single-site case study to understand the impact of <b>accrual</b> <b>accounting</b> on managerial decision making. The history of the NSW Government adoption of <b>accrual</b> <b>accounting</b> is characterised by five notable features. First, the whole-of-government initiative was implemented with remarkable speed. Second, the change was aided by the actions of an epistemic community, in which private sector consultants were most active. Third, the change was justified through expected improvements in accountability and management. Fourth, a period of resistance to the change was followed by an absence of critical discussion on the implications of the change as forces supportive of the change synergistically combined. Fifth, the change is explained by mimetic forces that initially coalesced around phantom images, presented by consultants, and subsequently recognised self-interest {{as an integral part of}} the change to <b>accrual</b> <b>accounting.</b> The impact of <b>accrual</b> <b>accounting</b> on management decision-making at an organisational level from has been mixed. Information acquisition has expanded in that new sets of accounting data are collected. However, information distribution has been unchanged by <b>accrual</b> <b>accounting</b> whilst information interpretation only marginally changed at a top management level with no discernible change at operational levels. Organisational memory has been altered by <b>accrual</b> <b>accounting</b> in that additional accounting skills and information are now held. However, use of that organisational memory is severely impeded by organisational objectives and constraints that effectively render <b>accrual</b> <b>accounting</b> information irrelevant to public sector managers’ concerns. Policy implications arising from this project are that an alternative model of <b>accrual</b> <b>accounting</b> is required together with the dual recognition that centrally imposed change may produce unpredicted change at an operational agency level and that accounting change needs to be matched to organisational characteristics. Additionally, improvements in asset management, as sought by advocates of <b>accrual</b> <b>accounting,</b> could have been delivered by non-accounting means and there is little prospect for improved managerial decision-making from the current model of <b>accrual</b> <b>accounting.</b> Thesis (Ph.
