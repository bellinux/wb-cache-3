40|$|To {{evaluate}} the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) proviral DNA load among asymptomatic HTLV-I-infected carriers and patients with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), real time PCR using TaqMan probes for the pol gene {{was performed in}} two million {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC). The albumin gene was the internal genomic control and MT 2 cells were used as positive control. The results are reported as copies/ 10, 000 PBMC, and the detection limit was 10 copies. A total of 89 subjects (44 HAM/TSP and 45 healthy HTLV-I-infected carriers) followed up at the Institute of Infectious Diseases "Emilio Ribas" and in the Neurology Division of Hospital of Clínicas were studied. The asymptomatic HTLV-I-infected carriers had a median number of 271 copies (ranging from 5 to 4756 copies), whereas the HAM/TSP cases presented a median of 679 copies (5 - 5360 copies) in 10, 000 PBMC. Thus, HAM/TSP patients presented a significantly higher HTLV-I proviral DNA load than healthy HTLV-I carriers (P = 0. 005, one-way Mann-Whitney test).

40|$|Background: The {{relationship}} between clinical factors and reoffending in psychiatric and correctional populations is unclear, {{with a lot}} of contradictory results and some clinical areas lacking in research. The overall aim of this thesis was to add to this knowledge-base within the framework of risk assessment and management. Paper I investegated the association between self-assessed personality disorder and reoffending. Paper II investigated the association between clinical factors and aggressive behaviour in patients in psychiatric after-care. Paper III described the development of a structured method for risk management, SORM, the instrument used to collect data on dynamic risk and protective factors and reoffending, presented in papers IV and V. Methods: Paper I was a prospective follow-up of 168 offenders who underwent court-ordered pre-sentencing psychiatric evaluation in Sweden. The DIP-Q self-assessment instrument was used, and mean time-at-risk in the community at follow-up was 3 years. Paper II was prospective follow-up of 128 psychiatric inpatients one year into their after-care. Clinical factors were assessed at discharge and after six months in the community. Paper III described the development of a protocol for <b>monotoring</b> and managing risk in the community; SORM. Paper IV was a prospective, once-per month, two year follow-up of discharged forensic psychiatric patients using the SORM. Paper V was a retrospective case-control study of rapidly recidivating violent offenders {{who had been in the}} community less than two years before charged with a new violent offences. Results: An association was found between self-assessed antisocial and schizoid personality disorder and re-offending (paper I), and between ASPD, and positive psychotic symptoms, especially so called TCO symptoms, and aggressive behaviour for psychiatric patients in after-care (paper II). The clinical factors of the SORM were the ones that best predicted the outcome criteria of reoffending or risk situations (paper IV) and reoffending among violent offenders (paper V). Conclusions: The results from the four clinical follow-up studies I-II, IV-V examined the relationship over time between clinical factors and offending from different viewpoints, all of which underlined the relative importance of clinical factors for the risk of recidivism. The need for new research approaches to build on risk prediction research and develop structured comprehensive risk management aids that focus more on dynamic, clinical factors is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MScAgric (Animal Sciences)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 1985. The {{domestication}} of ostriches {{and commercial}} ostrich breeding {{has a long}} and interesting history. Orstriches were successfully domesticated in Algeria during 1857 and also successfully bred in Italy during 1859. In South Africa the domestication of wild ostriches started in the Cape Colony with 80 tame birds during 1865. This number increased to 32 247 birds within ten years (De Mosenthal, 1877). Ostrich farming reached a peak during 1913 with 757 000 birds (De Jager, 1985, personal communication). Currently (1985) there are approximately 120 000 domesticated ostriches in South Africa. The commercial production of ostrich meat started in 1958 and the first abattoir was built in 1964. At the present moment 85 000 birds are slaughtered anually. Although the income from the carcass of a 14 month old ostrich comprise only 15 % of the total income of a 14 month old bird (With the hide comprising 65 % and, the first harvest feathers 20 %), the subjects of carcass characteristics and meat quality has long been neglected. Very {{little is known about}} the anatomy of the skeleton and muscles of the ostrich, the post mortem reactions of these muscles and the effects of different slaughtering, chilling and deboning practices.

40|$|Bosch Rexroth in Mellansel {{develops}} and fabricates Hägglunds {{hydraulic motors}} among other things. One {{important component of}} the motor is the cam ring, which commonly affects the life span of the motor. The aim is to create the basis of a testing equipment where a loose cam ring can be tested. Previously, a complete motor has been used in order to test the fatigue resistance of the cam ring. In order to load the cam ring similar to the real case. FEM-analysis was performed to investigate how the cam ring is affected during loading and how the rig should be built for the strains to be similar to the real case. The result of this simulation was compiled in a Haighdiagram in order to get an indication of the magnitude of the stresses. The solution is a testing equipment which consist of a cylinder block which usually is in the motor. The cylinder block is bolted onto a bottom plate where the cam ring has a given position. The cam ring is fixated using a sloted spring pin and a dowel pin that keeps the cam ring in position and prevents potential torque. All pistons should be pressurised by pulsation at the same time using the same pressure, thus, the torque is expected to be zero. One of the holes which is holding the cam ring is oval, this is to allow deformation of the cam ring. The result of this work is a basic plan for the components included which affects the mechanical function of the testing equipment. A limitation of this work has been that the residual stresses in the clearance holes is unknown. These residual stresses have a great importance for fatigue resistance of the cam rings. As a consequence of this, it has been difficult to estimate which working pressure the test rig has to use in order to achieve the desired life span. Experimental testing when using the rig will indicate this. Task <b>monotoring</b>  The testing equipment will generate 1 - 10 million loading cycles before failure of the cam ring occurs.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate claw health in four dairy herds (sizes between 50 and 150 cows) in the north-west of Lower Saxony (Germany) over a period of one year following the introduction of functional claw trimming. Additional to parameters suitable for evaluation of the claw health status (prevalence of claw diseases, severity of lameness), distinct risk indikators concerning the individual animal, the herd and the environment were examined using a modified protocol developed by Nordlund et al. (2004). To this end, the claw diseases that were diagnosed at claw trimming on three different occasions were assigned to, either the complex “infectious diseases”, “laminitis-associated diseases” or “miscellaneous diseases”. Initially, the suitability of the environment was evaluated by using a system to quantify cow-comfort, the Tiergerechtheitsindex TGI 200. Lameness scores were documented in two-week intervals as well as the following risk indicators: Stall Standing Index (SSI), standing time during milking, cud chewing activity, scoring of rumen fill, Body Condition Scoring (BCS). Milkfat-to protein ratio was calculated from the data obtained from the monthly milk recordings. On all four farms the results with respect to the selected risk indicators differed, partially considerably, from the guidelines given in literature. The proportion of lame cows and the severity of lameness as observed in the beginning of the study justified the assignment of the included herds to “herds with a serious lameness problem”. The Tiergerechtheitsindex TGI 200 differed from the guidelines as well as the daily standing time (SSI, standing time at milking) and the rumination activity. With respect to the TGI 200, the main deficits were found in the space allowance and the cubicle comfort, factors that were shown to lead to increased standing times. On all four farms the findings concerning the development of BCS and milk production data did correspond with the nominal values. The introduction of functional claw trimming on all four farms led to a partially significant decrease in the number of cows affected by severe lameness (grade 3 and 4), indicating the benefit of the latter procedure for animal welfare. The prevalence of claw diseases, however, did not change. Improvement of environment on these farms should aim at increasing the room for movement and the cubicle comfort. It is likely that improving cow-comfort in such way that standing times decrease would have a positive effect on claw health by increasing blood circulation in the distal limb. Special attention should be drawed to the heifer management, especially the introduction of highly-pregnant animals into the herd. On the four farms risk indicators which were reported to be related to the ocurrence of claw disorders before differed to a large extent from the given guidelines. This fact demonstrates that these parameters should be taken into consideration for the approach of claw health disorders on dairy farms. However, further research is necessary to develop and improve the employed methods and to establish a suitable system for <b>monotoring</b> claw health which can be used in practice by farmer, clawtrimmer and veterinarian in cooperation. To get generally accepted results the methods have to be tested in case control studies or on farms were the effect of different housing systems can be studied at the same time. The different scoring methods are time-consuming and still do not find the farmers` appreciation. Thus, there is need for further research on the use of innovative measurement technologies and data analysis that aim at automation of the monitoring procedures (e. g. gait analysis by pattern recognition) ...|$|E
40|$|A Ãlcera por pressÃo (UP) Ã uma manifestaÃÃo clÃnica frequente em pacientes de Unidade de Terapia Intensiva (UTI) e reflexo indireto da assistÃncia dos profissionais de saÃde. O surgimento de UP em pacientes crÃticos estÃ relacionado com maiores gastos, tempo de internamento e complicaÃÃes clÃnicas, portanto, predizer quais os sujeitos mais vulnerÃveis a este problema Ã fundamental. Na {{literatura}} hÃ vÃrias escalas publicadas com este propÃsito. Contudo, no Brasil, atÃ o momento, nÃo se encontra publicaÃÃes que tenham verificado qual a melhor escala para medir o risco de se desenvolver UP. O objetivo deste estudo foi verificar a acurÃcia das escalas de avaliaÃÃo de risco para Ãlcera por pressÃo de Norton, Braden e Waterlow em pacientes crÃticos. Verificar a incidÃncia de Ãlcera por pressÃo em pacientes crÃticos. Estudo longitudinal realizado em quatro unidades de terapias intensiva de um hospital escola de Fortaleza â Brasil, durante o perÃodo de marÃo a julho de 2009. Foram investigados 42 pacientes crÃticos, cada sujeito passou por um processo de 10 a 15 dias de acompanhamento, em cada dia deste intervalo eram aplicadas as escalas de risco para Ãlcera por pressÃo de Norton, Braden, e Waterlow. Na anÃlise dos dados foi empregado Teste do Qui-Quadrado para verificaÃÃo de associaÃÃes entre as variÃveis categÃricas e o teste T de Student para comparaÃÃo das variÃveis contÃnuas. Alem disso, houve o cÃlculo dos coeficientes de validade e de Spearman. Dos 42 pacientes avaliados, 25 desenvolveram Ãlceras por pressÃo evidenciando uma incidÃncia de 59, 5 %. Entre os estadiamento foram observados 23 (48, 9 %) com grau I e 24 (51, 1 %) com grau II. A regiÃo sacral e occipital foram os locais onde mais ocorreu lesÃes (38, 3 %). Naqueles que desenvolveram UP, a presenÃa de duas lesÃes foi o predominante (64 %). As escalas de Norton e Waterlow apresentaram os mesmos coeficientes de validaÃÃo, ambas apresentaram sensibilidade, valor preditivo positivo e negativo de 100 %. A escala de Braden apresentou sensibilidade, especificidade, valor preditivo positivo e negativo de 31, 2 %, 88, 2 %, 71, 4 % e 64, 4 %, respectivamente. Pelo mÃtodo de Waterlow houve uma maior incidÃncia lesÃes (23, 8 %), em relaÃÃo aos demais mÃtodos, sendo que a mÃdia de lesÃes, por Waterlow, foi, praticamente, trÃs vezes maior do que o de Norton (p= 0, 004). Pelo mÃtodo de Braden, quanto maior a idade, maior Ã o aparecimento de UP (p= 0, 012). A incidÃncia de Ãlcera por pressÃo pelo mÃtodo de Waterlow foi superior em relaÃÃo aos mÃtodos de Norton e Braden que foram proporcionais. As escalas de Norton e Braden apresentaram elevada sensibilidade para pacientes crÃticos. The {{pressure ulcer}} (PU) {{is a common}} clinical manifestation in patients of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and indirect reflection of assistance from health professionals. The emergence of PU in critically ill patients is related to higher expenses, length of stay and clinical complications, therefore, predict which subjects more vulnerable to this problem is fundamental. In the literature there are various scales published for this purpose. However, in Brazil, so far, is not content that they {{have found that the}} best scale to measure the risk of developing UP. The objective of this stuy is to verify the accuracy of risk evaluation scales to ulcer by pressure of Norton, Braden and Waterlow in critic patients and to verify the incidence of ulcer by pressure in critic patients. Longitudinal study accomplished in four intensive therapy units in a school-hospital in Fortaleza-Brazil, between March and July 2009. 42 critic patients have been investigated, each subject went through a 10 to 15 days <b>monotoring,</b> in each day of this period the risk evaluation scales to ulcer by pressure of Norton, Braden and Waterlow was applied. During the analysis of data the Qui-Quadrado test was applied to verify the associations among the categoric variables and the T de Student test to compare the continuous variables. Besides this, there was the coeficient calculation of validiy and Spearman. Of the 42 evaluated pacients, 25 developed ulcer by pressure showing an incidence of 59, 5 %. About the statement we observed (48, 9 %) with grade I and 24 (51, 1 %) with grade II. The occipital and sacral region were the sites where most injuries occurred (38. 3 %). Those who developed UP, the presence of two lesions was the predominant 64 %. The Norton an Waterlow scales presented the same validation coeficients, both showed sensibility, positive and negative predictive value of 100 %. The Braden scale showed sensibility, specialty, positive and negative predictive value of 31, 2 %, 88, 2 %, 71, 4 % and 64, 4 %, respectively. By the Waterlow method there was a bigger incidence of lesions (23, 8 %), in relation to the other methods, being the average of lesions, by Waterlow, practically three times bigger than the Norton (p= 0, 004). By the Braden method, the bigger the age, the bigger the UP (p= 0, 012) ...|$|E
