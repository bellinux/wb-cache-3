5|$|Ascall's {{father was}} Ragnall mac Torcaill (died 1146), {{a man who}} <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> ruled as King of Dublin. The men {{were members of the}} Meic Torcaill, a {{substantial}} landholding kindred in the kingdom. Several members of this Norse-Gaelic family held the kingship in the twelfth century. One such man was Ascall's uncle, Brodar mac Torcaill, King of Dublin, who was slain in 1160.|$|E
5|$|In 1525, the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés passed {{within a}} few {{kilometres}} of the ruins of Tikal but did not mention them in his letters. After Spanish friar Andrés de Avendaño became lost in the Petén forests in early 1696 he described a ruin that <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> been Tikal.|$|E
5|$|One B-26, {{after being}} seriously damaged by {{anti-aircraft}} fire, made a suicide run on Akagi. Making {{no attempt to}} pull out of its run, the aircraft narrowly missed crashing directly into the carrier's bridge, which could have killed Nagumo and his command staff. This experience <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> contributed to Nagumo's determination to launch another attack on Midway, in direct violation of Yamamoto's order to keep the reserve strike force armed for anti-ship operations.|$|E

5|$|Shakespeare makes {{reference}} to Birnam Wood {{being used as}} camouflage for Malcolm Canmore’s army before the battle at Dunsinane with MacBeth. There is an ancient tree, the Birnam Oak, standing a few hundred metres from the centre of Birnam. It <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> been part of Birnam Wood {{at the time of}} the battle 900 years ago, and remains part of the legend.|$|E
5|$|Since {{at least}} some of Tyrannosauruss {{potential}} prey could move quickly, evidence that it walked instead of ran could indicate that it was a scavenger. On the other hand, recent analyses suggest that Tyrannosaurus, while slower than large modern terrestrial predators, <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> been fast enough to prey on large hadrosaurs and ceratopsians.|$|E
5|$|The best decade for January movies, Burr writes, <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> {{been the}} 1940s. It began {{with what he}} {{suggests}} was best January in cinema history. The Grapes of Wrath, His Girl Friday and The Shop Around the Corner, all considered classics, were released in January 1940. Later in the decade, other classic films would first reach screens during January, such as Sullivan's Travels, Shadow of a Doubt and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.|$|E

5|$|The icebergs' melting caused {{extensive}} {{amounts of}} fresh water {{to be added to}} the North Atlantic. Such inputs of cold and fresh water <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> altered the density-driven, thermohaline circulation patterns of the ocean, and often coincide with indications of global climate fluctuations.|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} {{thorn in}} the side of the Scottish Crown at the turn of the thirteenth century was Haraldr Maddaðarson, Earl of Orkney and Caithness (died 1206). At some point in the last half of the twelfth century, Haraldr put aside his first wife, a daughter of an Earl of Fife, and married Hvarflǫð, a daughter of an Earl of Ross. The latter woman was a member of the powerful meic Áedha, a northern kindred who had been in open conflict with the Scottish Crown throughout the twelfth century. Previous Orcadian earls had extended influence into Ross, and it <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> been through Hvarflǫð, and the claims to the earldom that she passed to their children, that drew Haraldr into conflict with the Scots.|$|E
5|$|Conrad {{seems to}} have been {{involved}} when Henry V revolted against his father in 1105. This would explain his election as Archbishop of Salzburg at the Diet of Mainz on 7 January 1106. At that time the anti-Archbishop Berthold von Moosburg was installed in Salzburg. Conrad came to Salzburg accompanied by his brothers, the counts Otto and Wolfram, with an escort of 1,000 soldiers. Some of these soldiers <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> been servitors, servile rather than free vassals. With this display of force, he was able to force Berthold to abdicate. Pope Paschal II consecrated him as bishop on 21 October 1106 and gave him the pallium.|$|E

5|$|If the Annals of Inisfallen {{is to be}} believed, Toirdelbach {{acquired}} {{possession of}} Dublin when the Dubliners themselves offered him its kingship. Although this record may be mere Uí Briain propaganda, it could instead reveal that the Dubliners preferred a distant overlord from Munster rather than one from neighbouring Leinster. Within the year, the kingship was held by Gofraid mac Amlaíb meic Ragnaill (died 1075). The latter {{appears to have been}} a kinsman of Echmarcach, and <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> been handed the kinship by Toirdelbach, perhaps on account of the considerable distance between the kingdoms.|$|E
5|$|Isabeau {{was removed}} from {{political}} influence and retired {{to live in the}} Hôtel Saint-Pol with her brother's second wife, Catherine of Alençon. She was accompanied by her ladies-in-waiting Amelie von Orthenburg and Madame de Moy, the latter of whom had traveled from Germany and had stayed with her as dame d'honneur since 1409. Isabeau died there in 1435. Her death and funeral were documented by Jean Chartier (member of St Denis Abbey) who <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> been an eyewitness.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} {{when the first}} fortification at Longtown was built. The first defences may have been built during either the Iron Age or Roman, or Anglo-Saxon periods, but this remains uncertain. If Roman defences were constructed at the site, it was probably because of a Roman road that may have run nearby, and the defences <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> then been reused {{in the building of}} the current castle, parts of whose earthworks have square, angular corners, similar to those of Roman forts but otherwise unusual in 12th century English castles.|$|E

5|$|It <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> been these Inquisitors who, in 1543, {{decided that}} Mercator was eminent {{enough to be}} sacrificed. His name {{appeared}} {{on a list of}} 52 Lutheran heretics which included an architect, a sculptor, a former rector of the university, a monk, three priests and many others. All were arrested except Mercator who had left Leuven for Rupelmonde on business concerning the estate of his recently deceased uncle Gisbert. That made matters worse for he was now classified as a fugitive who, by fleeing arrest, had proved his own guilt.|$|E
5|$|Many historians {{maintain}} {{that given the}} massive reductions in US military aid to South Vietnam after 1973, any major PAVN offensive was bound to succeed. However, the ARVN's soldiers were hardened veterans, and South Vietnam maintained vast stockpiles of ammunition and equipment (as demonstrated by the massive quantities of war materiel captured by the PAVN when the war ended). The final collapse of the ARVN <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> been inevitable, but the end {{would have been much}} bloodier and much longer in coming had the PAVN chosen a more direct, conventional plan of attack. In fact, the most damaging blow of the entire PAVN campaign may have been the crushing psychological blow their skillful and unexpected strategy dealt to the mind of the ARVN's commander-in-chief.|$|E
5|$|Ruler 4 was {{succeeded by}} K'inich Ich'aak Chapat in 723. Around 725 Toniná fought {{a war against}} Piedras Negras, a city on the north bank of the Usumacinta River, now in Guatemala. A series of events during his reign were marked on monuments between 726 and 729 and in 730 he rededicated the tomb of his {{predecessor}} K'inich B'aaknal Chaak. The mother of K'inich Ich'aak Chapat is named as Lady Winik Timan K'awiil and his father <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> been K'inich B'aaknal Chaak himself. The reign of K'inich Ich'aak Chapat is notable {{for the absence of}} the usual sculptures depicting bound war captives, although {{the reason for this is}} unknown.|$|E

5|$|The Sicilian {{historian}} Diodorus Siculus, {{writing in}} the 1st century BC in his Bibliotheca Historica, also provides {{an account of the}} Battle of Plataea. This account is fairly consistent with Herodotus's, but given that it was written much later, it <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> been derived from Herodotus's version. The Battle is also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including Plutarch, Ctesias of Cnidus, and is alluded by other authors, such as the playwright Aeschylus. Archaeological evidence, such as the Serpent Column also supports some of Herodotus's specific claims.|$|E
5|$|The first botanical {{collection}} {{of this species}} <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> been Claude Riche, naturalist to Bruni d'Entrecasteaux's 1791 expedition {{in search of the}} lost ships of Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse. During a visit to Esperance Bay, Riche explored an area in which B.speciosa is extremely common. However, he got lost and was forced to abandon his collections. The species was eventually collected by Robert Brown in 1802, and published by him in 1810. Alex George selected an 1802 specimen collected at Lucky Bay to be the lectotype in 1981. An early common name was handsome banksia. Common names include showy banksia and ricrac banksia, from the zigzag shape of its long thin leaves.|$|E
5|$|The {{islands of}} the Clyde <b>may</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> formed the power base of Somhairle mac Giolla Brighde and his {{descendants}} by {{the last half of}} the 12th century. At about this time period, the authority of the Steward of Scotland seems to have encroached into the region; and there is reason to suspect that, by the turn of the 13th century, the islands were consumed by the expanding Stewart lordship. The western extension of Scottish authority appears to have been one of the factors behind a Norwegian invasion of the region in 1230, in which the invaders seized Rothesay Castle.|$|E
