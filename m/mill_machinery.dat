5|$|The river curves to {{the east}} along the {{southern}} edge of Mayfield, passing a sewage works on the south bank and crossing under an abandoned railway embankment and a road at St Dunstan's Bridge. A tributary joins from the south, which once drove Moat Mill. The mill house dates from the seventeenth century, is timber framed and has been faced with red brick on the ground floor while the attached three-storey mill building dates from the following century. It has been converted into a house, although most of the <b>mill</b> <b>machinery</b> is still present, but has been isolated from the living space by glass panels.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} company that built the Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge, T. B. White and Sons, {{was established in}} 1868. Its founder Timothy B. White had been a carpenter and contractor in New Brighton, Pennsylvania since the 1840s. White also operated factories for iron cars and woolen <b>mill</b> <b>machinery</b> until 1859, {{when he began to}} concentrate solely on bridge construction. White's bridge company operated from a factory on the Beaver River in New Brighton until the factory was destroyed by fire in 1878. After the fire, the company relocated across the river to Beaver Falls and restructured as the Penn Bridge and Machine Works. In addition to iron truss bridges, the company produced a range of structural and architectural components and continued to expand; it employed over 500 workers by 1908. Penn Bridge and Machine Works fended off purchase by the American Bridge Company and continued to operate independently, unlike similar small bridge companies founded in the 19th century. The most prolific {{of its kind in the}} Pittsburgh region, the company was responsible for the construction of bridges throughout the United States.|$|E

25|$|By 1821 Hick was {{managing}} partner of the Union Foundry, that later became Rothwell, Hick and Rothwell. After Peter Rothwell's death on 2 August 1824, the company continued with Peter Rothwell Jr (1792–1849) as Rothwell, Hick & Co. They made stationary steam engines, (a number of which were featured by John Farey in the second volume of his Treatise on the Steam Engine, 1827) as well as general engineering products including cast iron dockyard cranes. Rothwell, Hick and Rothwell were listed in Baines' directory as supplying steam engines, hydraulic presses, weighing machines, gas light apparatus, <b>mill</b> <b>machinery,</b> sugar mills and constructors of fire proof buildings.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though both}} plants were busy during the war, {{the company did}} not prosper in the forties due to {{shortages}} of lumber and labor as the country's workforce went to war. Minutes of the 1946 stockholders' meeting show the company's lumber inventory had been reduced, from over 3 million board feet in 1942, to just over a million in 1946. After the war, there was pent-up demand not only for boxes and crates, but also for furniture that the Tacoma plant had been producing. The company expanded to produce box-springs, and began an effort to improve handling of lumber to be kiln-dried. Both plants also continued to replace aging steam engines and boilers with electrical <b>mill</b> <b>machinery.</b> But there were no dividends distributed to stockholders for 1946. The trends of the decade were higher wages, shortages of materials, higher prices, and heavy competition, especially from local non-unionized factories.|$|E
500|$|While the smelter sat idle, mining {{activity}} continued {{on the south}} side of the river in the Hope-Katy mine complex, at the Hope Mill, which crushed and separated ore, and at the Basin Reduction Works. Flumes carried water from upstream on Cataract Creek and Basin Creek to a storage reservoir in town and supplied water to the mills as well as the town's fire hydrants. A separate flume carried water to the mills from upstream on the Boulder River. At the Basin Reduction Works, Corliss steam engines, driven by the coal-fired boilers, provided power to run the mine hoists and the <b>mill</b> <b>machinery,</b> and an electric generator powered by a water wheel made electricity for factory lights and the arc lights at Basin's street intersections. Surplus tailings were discharged into the river and into a dam built for the purpose downstream of [...] Basin.|$|E

2500|$|The hedgerow trees {{accepted}} {{today as}} part of the familiar landscape were not planted by farmers for visual effect, they were crops and the wood was used for building and fencing and the millers needed beech or hornbeam wood for <b>mill</b> <b>machinery,</b> in particular for the sacrificial cogs on the main drive gears. It is not generally appreciated how much the Ayrshire landscape has changed its character, for even in 1760–70 the Statistical Account it is stated that [...] "there was no such thing to be seen as trees or hedges in the parish; all was naked and open".|$|E
2500|$|Navigation on the lode ceased around 1900, {{and it is}} not {{currently}} navigable. The mill at Lode has been restored to working order by its owners, the National Trust. The timber framed building dates from the late eighteenth century and has a low breastshot waterwheel. The <b>mill</b> <b>machinery</b> was replaced in 1868 by W Rawlings, and the external cladding dates from the 1934 and 1978 restoration. [...] There is a pumping station and a set of mitred flood doors {{at the entrance to the}} lode, which were replaced in 2001, but a [...] "No unauthorised vessels" [...] notice was displayed on the gates in 2008.|$|E

2500|$|A dam {{was built}} on the San Lorenzo River {{upstream}} of the powder works on what is now Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park. A [...] tunnel [...] long was dug in 1863 to bring water from the dam through the powder works. Water powered powder <b>mill</b> <b>machinery</b> and was used to dissolve and purify the crude potassium nitrate from Chile. Water was distributed through the powder works by a system of flumes later dismantled when electricity became available to power the wheel mills. Charcoal was manufactured locally using redwood fuel to char willow, madrone and alder. To facilitate transport and shipping, the company built a bridge across the river (the first bridge can be seen in an early panoramic lithograph, viewable online) and purchased a wharf off the main Santa Cruz beach.|$|E
2500|$|The mill {{measures}} [...] wide by [...] long. A {{date stone}} on an exterior wall is marked [...] "Nathan'l Mary Newlin 1704." [...] The dam and the half-mile mill race, which provides {{the water that}} powers the mill, were built the same year. The original grindstone was imported from France. The mill was built of fieldstone into a hillside: the north side two stories, the south side one story high. The mill wheel was originally outside the mill and was probably breastshot. It was reconstructed in 1976, weighs [...] and measures , with 52 buckets. The water exits underground through the tail race and travels about [...] back to Chester Creek. The floors and <b>mill</b> <b>machinery</b> are supported by a hurst frame, an inner timber frame that is separated from the outer stone walls so that vibrations do not break the outer walls. The process of grinding the corn may be viewed at the mill or on video.|$|E
2500|$|The {{internal}} millworkings {{and structural}} members installed during the 1933 reconstruction {{were taken from}} an 1818 gristmill located near Front Royal, Virginia. [...] Some of the structural members from Front Royal mill {{are still in the}} building; however, most of the millworkings were replaced between 1997 and 2002. [...] The interior has exposed masonry walls with heavy timber framing. The flooring throughout the building is random-width pine. A masonry fireplace is in the southwest corner of the first floor. The grinding platform is accessed from the second floor. [...] The third level is one large room with rolling screens and other processing equipment. A staircase in the western half of the structure runs from the first floor to attic. [...] The mill’s two grinding stones are powered by a pitch-back water wheel. The <b>mill</b> <b>machinery</b> is enclosed in a hurst frame, built from heavy oak and pine beams. Its frame is built directly on the mill’s foundation, and is not connected to the walls. [...] This protects the structure from the machinery’s potentially damaging vibrations. The hurst frame occupies the eastern half of the first two levels.|$|E

60|$|The Silver Lady {{on her own}} part also {{wished for}} silence, as she looked for the effect on her {{companion}} when {{the glory of the}} view should break upon her. When they had climbed the winding stone stair, which led up some twenty feet, there was a low wide landing with the remains of the main shaft of the <b>mill</b> <b>machinery</b> running through it. From one side rose a stone stair curving with the outer wall of the mill tower and guarded by a heavy iron rail. A dozen steps there were, and then a landing a couple of yards square; then a deep doorway cut in the thickness of the wall, round which the winding stair continued.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{the scene}} was {{transformed}} for him back almost a score of years into the past. For, as Tommy pumped away, Miss Phoebe struck a low bass note on the organ and held it to test the volume of air that it contained. The church ceased to exist, so far as Father Abram was concerned. The deep, booming vibration that shook the little frame building was no note from an organ, but the humming of the <b>mill</b> <b>machinery.</b> He felt sure that the old overshot-wheel was turning; that he was back again, a dusty, merry miller in the old mountain mill. And now evening was come, and soon would come Aglaia with flying colours, toddling across the road to take him home to supper. Father Abram's eyes were fixed upon the broken door of the cottage.|$|E
6000|$|There {{came in the}} {{afternoon}} a respectable man in gray homespun cloth, who arrived in a wagon, I believe, and began to inquire, after supper, about a certain new kind of <b>mill</b> <b>machinery.</b> Being referred to the blacksmith, who owned one of these mills, the stranger {{said that he had}} come from Vermont to learn about the matter. [...] "What may I call your name?" [...] said he to the blacksmith. [...] "My name is Hodge," [...] replied the latter. [...] "I believe I have heard of you," [...] said the stranger. Then they colloquied at much length about the various peculiarities and merits of the new invention. The stranger continued here two or three days, making his researches, and forming acquaintance with several millwrights and others. He was a man evidently of influence in his neighborhood, and the tone of his conversation was in the style of one accustomed to be heard with deference, though all in a plain and homely way. Lawyer H------ took notice of this manner; for the talk being about the nature of soap, and the evil odor arising from that process, the stranger joined in. [...] "There need not be any disagreeable smell in making soap," [...] said he. [...] "Now we are to receive a lesson," [...] said H------, and the remark was particularly apropos to the large wisdom of the stranger's tone and air.|$|E
50|$|The {{company began}} in 1851 as the Nordyke, Ham & Company {{started in the}} {{manufacture}} of <b>milling</b> <b>machinery</b> in a small shop in Richmond, Indiana. Previously, Ellis Nordyke, a prominent millwright, had been making hand made milling equipment himself in Richmond. Buhr stones from France were imported for grinding grains.|$|R
