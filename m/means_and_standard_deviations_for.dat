50|$|Stevens (1946) argued that, {{because the}} {{assumption}} of equal distance between categories does not hold for ordinal data, the use of <b>means</b> <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> <b>for</b> description of ordinal distributions and of inferential statistics based on {{means and standard deviations}} was not appropriate. Instead, positional measures like the median and percentiles, in addition to descriptive statistics appropriate for nominal data (number of cases, mode, contingency correlation), should be used. Nonparametric methods have been proposed as the most appropriate procedures for inferential statistics involving ordinal data, especially those developed for the analysis of ranked measurements. However, use of parametric statistics for ordinal data may be permissible with certain caveats {{to take advantage of the}} greater range of available statistical procedures.|$|E
50|$|The {{test was}} {{developed}} using {{a sample of}} responses from the comparison of 504 sets of results from a trial by students, taken from a larger sample of 950 first year university student responses.The test was then normed on a sample of 1044 males and 1870 females aged between 17 and 69 years, across participants of varying backgrounds, including university students, nurses in training and blue and white collared employees of a major airline, bank, railway workshop and naval dockyard. The scores were subsequently checked for validity against outpatient groups including patients suffering from anxiety and depressive disorders, insomniacs, myocardial infarction patients, as well as patients undergoing treatment for sexual, menopausal and depressive disorders. While the test was not normed against samples younger than 17, due to the simplicity of language, {{there has been no}} compelling evidence against the use of the scales for comparison against children as young as 12.The reliability scores of the scales in terms of Cronbach's alpha scores rate the Depression scale at 0.91, the Anxiety scale at 0.84 and the Stress scale at 0.90 in the normative sample. The <b>means</b> <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> <b>for</b> each scale are 6.34 and 6.97 for depression, 4.7 and 4.91 for anxiety and 10.11 and 7.91 for stress, respectively. The mean scores in the normative sample did vary slightly between genders as well as varying by age, though the threshold scores for classifications do not change by these variations. The Depression and Stress scales meet the standard threshold requirement of 0.9 for research, however, the Anxiety scale still meets the 0.7 threshold for clinical applications, and is still close to the 0.9 required for research.|$|E

30|$|Some {{instructors}} {{might be}} surprised that students are not coordinating these concepts. In fact, some instructors find it curious that we are using <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> as a test case of complex understanding. These concepts might seem relatively simple or basic especially compared {{to the rest of}} the topics covered in an undergraduate statistics course. However, these “basic” concepts can take on different meanings as they are connected to more and more topics in the curriculum such as sampling distributions, correlation, regression, and ANOVA. The relationship of <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> in the context of a t-test is not the same, for example, as in the context of the Central Limit Theorem, where the <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of populations have a predictable relationship to the <b>means</b> <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> of the sampling distributions they can give rise to. Students might have a sense that the concepts of <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> are fundamental because they come up repeatedly.

30|$|One {{possibility}} is that students were never required during their formal course to relate the concepts of <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> to the procedure for conducting an independent samples t-test. Most students do learn how to calculate a t-statistic and a p value, and in what situations these statistics can be applied. However, learning how to calculate or use a t-test does not necessarily imply a deep {{understanding of how the}} test is related to <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation.</b> We speculate that most students {{would have been able to}} tell us that they needed the <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> in order to calculate a t-statistic. However, although the formula for the t-statistic does represent <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> in relation to each other, understanding this relationship is not necessary for performing the computation.
