40|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} experienced with LAN-based video conferencing systems is the degradation of conference latency and fidelity due to network congestion. In this paper, we present a comprehensive transmission control framework describing the relationship of latency and fidelity to properties of human perception and network congestion. We discuss how network factors such as physical link capacity and size of <b>maximum</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>units</b> may exacerbate the effects of congestion on the conference and how the impact of congestion can be ameliorated through judicious adaptation of the media streams' bit and message rates. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of an adaptive transmission control algorithm based upon the framework to produce low-latency, high-fidelity conferences over congested internetworks. 1.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of protocols, such as TCP/IP, and their {{integration into the}} operating system environment is very decisive for protocol performance. Putting TCP on high-speed networks, e. g. ATM, with large <b>maximum</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>units</b> causes the TCP maximum segment size to be relatively large. What Nagle's algorithm consider a "small" segment is not small any more which affects the TCP performance. We report on TCP/IP throughput and RPC response time performance measurements for various sizes of send and receive socket buffers, using the Sparc 10 architecture machines Axil 311 / 5. 1 running SunOS 4. 1. 3 connected to FORE System's ATM network. For some common combinations of socket buffer sizes we observe a dramatic performance degradation to less than 1 % of expected throughput and to one order-ofmagnitude longer response time than expected.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedData exfiltration over a network {{poses a threat}} to confidential information. Due to the possibility of malicious insiders, this threat is especially difficult to mitigate. Our goal is to {{contribute to the development of}} a method to detect exfiltration of many targeted files without incurring the full cost of reassembling flows. One strategy for accomplishing this would be to implement an approximate matching scheme that attempts to determine whether a file is being transmitted over the network by analyzing the quantity of payload data that matches fragments of the targeted file. Ourwork establishes the basic feasibility of such an approach by matching Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) payloads of traffic containing exfiltrated data against a database of MD 5 hashes, each representing a fragment of our target data. We tested against a database of 415 million fragment hashes, where the length of the fragments was chosen to be smaller than the payload size expected for most common <b>Maximum</b> <b>Transmission</b> <b>Units</b> (MTUs), and we simulated exfiltration by sending a sample of our targeted data across the network along with other non-target files representing noise. We demonstrate that under these conditions, we are able to detect the targeted content with a recall of 98. 3 % and precision of 99. 1 %. Civilian, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisc...|$|R
