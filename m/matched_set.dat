30|$|The {{subset of}} {{population}} rules that match the current input (RBN state) is termed the ‘match set’. The rules within the <b>match</b> <b>set</b> will suggest {{a number of}} actions. The fitness-weighted payoff of each action is used to select a single action to implement in the environment. The <b>match</b> <b>set</b> rules that suggest this single selected action form {{a subset of the}} <b>match</b> <b>set</b> called the ‘action set’. The action selected is then fed to an ‘effector’ that performs the desired actions within the environment. Information is then gathered on the payoff associated with the actions taken and the fitness of the rules within the rule collection is updated.|$|R

Introduction of a convenient equivalence relation on <b>match</b> <b>sets</b> reduces this effect and improves the tabulation algorithm. 1 Introduction Nowadays, many parts of a compiler can be generated automatically. For instance, the automatic generation of lexical and syntactic analyzers using notations based on regular expressions and context-free grammars is commonly used (see e. g. [1]). However, much research is still going on in the field of universal code-generator generators, which take a description of a machine as input and deliver a (good) code generator for that machine. C [...] ...|$|R
30|$|When {{an input}} is fed {{in to the}} LCS a <b>match</b> <b>set</b> is generated. This <b>match</b> <b>set</b> {{is a list of}} the rules from the {{population}} that match the input string. This is either via a direct match, such as when 0101110101 : 5 directly matches the input 0101110101, or an indirect match, such as when 1111 ## 0001 : 7 matches the input 1111000001.|$|R

The number is congruent {{with the number of}} siddhi or occult powers held in the Indian Religions. In Tibetan Buddhist art they are often depicted together as a <b>matched</b> <b>set</b> in works such as thangka paintings where they may be used collectively as border decorations around a central figure.|$|E

The player may swap any two {{adjacent}} tiles, {{as long as the}} swap results in a horizontal/vertical line of three or more matching tokens. The <b>matched</b> <b>set</b> disappears, allowing tokens to drop into the gaps from above; if more matched sets form as a result, they disappear as well.|$|E

50|$|Most irons in a player's bag are {{labelled}} with {{a number}} indicating their loft; the higher the number, the higher the loft. A <b>matched</b> <b>set</b> of irons will have a regular, progressive increase in loft through the irons, which may differ from set to set due to other design considerations that can affect launch angle and distance. Irons have been seen ranging in number from 0 through 12, but the most common number range in the modern iron set is 3 to 9.|$|E
5000|$|Each {{player in}} turn, after drawing but before {{discarding}}, may lay down any <b>matched</b> <b>set</b> or may lay off any card that matches a set {{already on the}} table. Cards that are laid off are kept {{on the table in}} front of the player. The player ends his turn by discarding a single card from his hand. Sequences may not [...] "go 'round the corner"; thus, Q K A or A 2 3 may be melded, but not K A 2.|$|E

At the end of this contract it re-entered regular service on both freight and passenger trains while still wearing its special colors. This continued for at least two months before it was repainted in the normal colors for the class.|$|E

40|$|Several {{algorithms}} {{are proposed}} in the literature to solve the difficult problem of feature point correspondence between image pairs. In order to obtain good quality results, they make use of different approaches and constraints {{to improve the quality}} of the <b>matching</b> <b>set.</b> A <b>matching</b> strategy is considered useful if it is able to filter out many of the mismatches found in an input <b>matching</b> <b>set</b> while keeping in most of the good matches present. In this paper, we present a survey of different matching strategies. We propose an empirical evaluation of their performance. The validation process used here determines the number of good matches and the proportion of good matches in a given <b>match</b> <b>set</b> and this for the different parameter values of a matching constraint...|$|R
