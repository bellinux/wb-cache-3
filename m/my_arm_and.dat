25|$|I {{remember}} somebody {{yelling and}} seeing a big {{ball of fire}} {{near the top of}} the tent. And this ball of fire just got bigger and bigger and bigger. By that time, everybody was panicking. The exit was blocked with the cages that the animals were brought in and out with. And there was a man taking kids and flinging them up and over that cage to get them out. I was sitting up in the bleachers and jumped down â€” I was three-quarters of the way up. You jump down and it was all straw underneath. There was a young man, a kid, and he had a pocketknife. And he slit the tent, took <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> pulled me out.|$|E

60|$|She {{slipped from}} <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> paused, {{regarding}} me. For an instant {{the world seemed}} full of fantastic possibilities.|$|R
60|$|She turned away, half-laughing, half-crying; but I {{caught her}} in <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> crushed her sweet lips against mine.|$|R
60|$|My father seized <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> held it fast. I {{turned and}} faced him.|$|E
