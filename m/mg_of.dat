25|$|Two major {{strategies}} used for monitoring and controlling V. pensylvanica include trapping with synthetic chemical attractants and tree shaking. Experiments on chemical attractants of V. pensylvanica and other generalist wasps show {{the effectiveness of}} using acetic acid in combination with these chemicals separately: isobutanol, heptyl butyrate, and butyl butyrate. Acetic acid alone {{did not have the}} same attractive effects as the chemical combinations. Using a vial dispenser, releasing up to an estimated 2.3 <b>mg</b> <b>of</b> heptyl butyrate per hour increased the number of yellowjackets attracted. In Hawaii, the Christmas tree is a large seasonal import each year. Over 90% of these trees contain live insects. Although V. pensylvanica typically resides in ground nests, queens occasionally choose these trees as overwintering sites. One potential strategy {{to reduce the number of}} yellowjackets and other generalist predators is applying preharvest permethrin sprays in combination with mechanical tree-shaking.|$|E

500|$|The {{nutritional}} {{components of}} R.virescens mushrooms have been characterized. Fresh mushrooms contain about 92.5% moisture. A [...] sample of dried mushroom (100gdw) has 365 kcal (1527 kilojoules). Carbohydrates {{make up the}} bulk of the fruit bodies, comprising 62% of the dry weight; 11.1% of the carbohydrates are sugars, the large majority of which (10.9%) is mannitol. The total lipid, or crude fat, content makes up 1.85% of the dry matter of the mushroom. The proportion of fatty acids (expressed as a percentage of total fatty acids) are 28.78% saturated, 41.51% monounsaturated, and 29.71% polyunsaturated. The most prevalent fatty acids include: palmitic acid, 17.3% of total fatty acids; stearic acid, 7.16%; oleic acid, 40.27%; and linoleic acid, 29.18%. Several bioactive compounds are present in the mushroom. One hundred grams (dry weight) contains 49.3 micrograms (µg) of tocopherols (20.0µg alpha, 21.3µg beta, and 8.0µg gamma) and 0.19 milligrams (<b>mg)</b> <b>of</b> the carotenoid pigment lycopene. There are 4.46g of organic acids per 100g of dry mushrooms, including oxalic acid (0.78g), malic acid (2.71g), citric acid (0.55g), and fumaric acid (0.23g). Mushrooms have 22.6mg/100gdw of the phenolic compound 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, and 15.8mg/100gdw of cinnamic acid.|$|E
