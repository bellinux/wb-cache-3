Because of these effects, chlorfenvinphos was often used on farms to control adult flies in dairy barns, milk rooms, poultry houses and yards and other animal buildings. Furthermore, it was used to control larval flies in manure storage pits and piles and other refuse accumulation areas around dairies and feedlots. In the early 1980s, chlorfenvinphos was registered for additional uses in a dust formulation for use in dog kennels and in dog collars for the control of fleas and ticks.

From the nature of the injuries to corn, particularly on account of the difficulty of any direct examination of some forms, and the difficulty of making any exact estimate, their injuries are, I think, very generally under-estimated. Probably the most serious losses come from those working under ground, the injuries of which are to be found simply in the lessened crop, and which consequently pass unnoticed by most farmers.

40|$|Fusarium {{species are}} among most common fungal {{pathogens}} of maize, causing root rot, stalk rot, stalk lodging and ear rot. Fusarium verticillioides and F. graminearum {{are two of}} the most prevalent stalk rot fungi in Nebraska and Iowa. Corn <b>root</b> <b>worms</b> (CRW) are the most costly pests of maize plants, causing damage to both above- and below-ground parts of the plant. CRW feeding on roots creates good invading sites for different fungal species. The goal of this research was to determine whether use of transgenic CRW-resistant maize hybrids will have reduced levels of Fusarium colonization of roots and stalks compared to their near-isogenic susceptible hybrids. Experiments were conducted at two locations each in 2007 and 2008 in fields with high populations of Western corn <b>root</b> <b>worms,</b> (Diabrotica virgifera LeConte) : Bruner farm near Ames, IA (2007), ISU Southeast Research Farm near Crawfordsville, IA (2007 - 2008), and Agricultural Research and Development Center, Univ. of NE near Mead, Nebraska (2007 - 2008). Commercially available hybrids with CRW-resistance transgenes along with their near-isogenic CRW-susceptible hybrids were planted. The CRW events include DAS- 59122 (Herculexy Xtra), MON 863 (Yieldgard Plusy), MON 88107 (Yieldgard VT Tripley) and MIR 604 (Agrisurey RW/CB/LL). In 2008, insecticidal seed treatment also was tested for its effect on CRW feeding and subsequent Fusarium colonization. Sampling was done on roots in mid-July and stalks in mid-September in 2007 and in 2008 mid-September roots were also sampled. Root colonization was assessed by dilution plating of dried ground tissue, and by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). v Primers and fluorogenic probes, specific to mycotoxin biosynthesis genes in F. verticillioides and F. graminearum were used to quantify root and stalk colonization. Standard calibration curves of both species showed linear correlation (r 2 = 0. 99) between the fungal genomic DNA and the threshold cycle values. There were highly significant differences in colonization between resistant and near isogenic susceptible hybrids for events MON 88017 and MIR 604 in Nebraska July roots in 2007. F. verticillioides was at high levels in Nebraska whereas F. graminearum was more common in Iowa. Stalks from both locations were highly colonized with F. graminearum. The PCR results were compared to a microbiological dilution plating method. In 2007 the results of the two methods correlated well but in 2008 they did not follow the same pattern. In dilution plating results we could consistently see significantly lower Fusarium CFU/g tissue in hybrids with CRW resistance than in near-isogenic CRW susceptible hybrids. Insecticidal seed treatment did not {{have a significant effect on}} level of colonization of fungal species measured by PCR or dilution plating results. CRW feeding on maize roots sometimes enhanced the infection of roots by Fusarium species and transgenic CRW resistant hybrids suffered less colonization than susceptible hybrids in CRW infested fields. However, the interaction between Fusarium spp and CRW varied in their degree among Fusarium species. Known maize pathogens F. verticillioides and F. graminearum were not consistently affected by CRW resistance as much as the total Fusarium population. The impact of this interaction on stalk rots is not clearly demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|In-furrow {{application}} of granular insecticides in corn {{is an effective}} way to provide root zone protection against insects such as corn <b>root</b> <b>worm,</b> wire worms, cutworms, white grubs and other harmful species. Traditional granular application methods consist of dispensing a uniform {{application of}} pesticide over {{the entire length of the}} furrow. A seed-specific granular pesticide application system was developed to decrease the volume of chemical used by metering pesticide into a modified seed tube fitted with a brush to hold granules in the seed tube. As a seed passes through the brush, granules are released and fall into the open furrow near the seed. Modifying seed tubes with a brush introduced the possibility of an effect on seed spacing. Effect of the seed tube modification on seed spacing was evaluated in laboratory and field trials. ^ Lab trials were performed using a stationary corn planter row unit. Variables tested were brushes (no, yes), granules (no, yes), seeds per second (8. 4, 20. 6), and tilt (no, 8 ° sidehill, 8 ° sidehill x 8 ° downhill). High speed video (1000 fps) recorded seed trajectory and the data was analyzed using multiple linear regression. Results showed while the brushes variable increased the standard deviation of horizontal seed velocity, vertical seed velocity, and seed speed, the combination of brushes and granules did not affect the standard deviation of horizontal seed velocity, vertical seed velocity, or seed speed. ^ Field trials consisted of 4 row plots, 30 m (100 ft) long, and replicated 3 times for a total of 12 rows for each variable. Data was recorded by measuring plant-toplant spacing. Data was then analyzed as a complete, unaltered, set and as an adjusted set with all data points 50 % above expected and 50 % below expected removed. Multiple linear regression was the analysis method of choice. Results showed that the brushes and granules combination did not affect seed spacing but did decrease standard deviation of seed spacing (full data set) and increase standard deviation of seed spacing (adjusted data set). ...|$|R
