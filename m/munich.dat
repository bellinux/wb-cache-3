5|$|After much discussion, {{the city}} of <b>Munich,</b> the state of Bavaria, Bayern <b>Munich</b> and 1860 <b>Munich</b> jointly decided {{at the end of}} 2000 to build a new stadium. While Bayern had wanted a {{purpose-built}} football stadium for several years, the awarding of the 2006 FIFA World Cup to Germany stimulated the discussion as the Olympiastadion no longer met the FIFA criteria to host a World Cup game. Located on the northern outskirts of <b>Munich,</b> the Allianz Arena has been in use {{since the beginning of the}} 2005–06 season. Its initial capacity of 66,000 fully covered seats has since been increased for matches on national level to 69,901 by transforming 3,000 seats to terracing in a 2:1 ratio. Since August 2012, 2,000 more seats were added in the last row of the top tier increasing the capacity to 71,000. In January 2015, a proposal to increase the capacity was approved by the city council so now Allianz Arena has a capacity of 75,000 (70,000 in Champions League).|$|E
5|$|Bayern is one {{of three}} {{professional}} football clubs in <b>Munich.</b> Bayern's main local rival is 1860 <b>Munich,</b> who were the more successful club in the 1960s, winning a cup and a championship. In the 1970s and 1980s, 1860 <b>Munich</b> moved between the first and the third division but lately, have settled in the second division. The <b>Munich</b> derby is still a much-anticipated event, getting a lot of extra attention from supporters of both clubs. 1860 <b>Munich</b> is considered more working-class, and therefore suffers from a diminishing fan base in a city where the manufacturing sector is declining. Bayern is considered the establishment club, which is reflected by many board members being business leaders and including the former Bavarian minister president, Edmund Stoiber. Despite the rivalry, Bayern has repeatedly supported 1860 in times of financial disarray.|$|E

5|$|Busch {{made contact}} with the artist {{association}} Jung München (Young <b>Munich),</b> met several notable <b>Munich</b> artists, and wrote and provided cartoons for the Jung München newspaper. Kaspar Braun, who published the satirical newspapers Münchener Bilderbogen (Picture Sheets from <b>Munich)</b> and Fliegende Blätter (Flying Leaves), proposed a collaboration with Busch. This association provided Busch with sufficient funds to live. An existing self-caricature suggests {{that at this time}} he had an intense relationship with a woman from Ammerland. His courtship with a seventeen-year-old merchant's daughter, Anna Richter, whom Busch met through his brother Gustav, ended in 1862. Busch's biographer, Diers, suggests that her father probably refused to entrust his daughter to an almost unknown artist without regular income.|$|E

A new grass pitch was placed over the existing football pitch while an artificial turf field was placed over the baseball diamond.|$|E

5|$|In 1873 Busch {{returned}} {{several times}} to <b>Munich,</b> and {{took part in the}} intense life of the <b>Munich</b> Art Society as an escape from provincial life. In 1877, in a last attempt to be a serious artist, he took a studio in <b>Munich.</b> He left <b>Munich</b> abruptly in 1881, after he disrupted a variety show and subsequently made a scene through the effects of alcohol The 1878 nine episode illustrated tale Eight Sheets in the Wind describes how humans behave like animals when drunk. Busch's biographer Weissweiler felt the story was only superficially funny and harmless, but was a study on addiction and its induced state of delusion.|$|E
