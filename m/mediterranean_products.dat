40|$|Introduction]. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) {{constitutes}} {{a major public}} intervention in the European Union (EU) which generates large redistributive effects. Significant resources are being transferred among producers and consumers of agricultural products and the taxpayers. The geographic distribution of these three groups (producers, consumers, taxpayers) in the different member states generates also transfers among the member states. The distribution of benefits and losses under the CAP has attracted the interest of researchers in the past. During the 1980 s, Buckwell et al (1982) and Brown (1989) dealt with this issue, when {{the rules of the}} ‘traditional’ CAP were very much in place. In the 1990 s, Ackrill, Hine, Rayner and Suardi (1997) obtained estimates {{of the impact of the}} 1992 CAP reform on the existing distribution of benefits and losses. However, their analysis is ex ante in nature and it concentrates on the most important products included in the 1992 reform of the CAP, excluding the <b>mediterranean</b> <b>products.</b> Tarditi and Zanias (1997 and 2000) do include the <b>mediterranean</b> <b>products</b> and obtain ex post results up to 1995 for the EU regions. Zanias (2002) includes the <b>mediterranean</b> <b>products,</b> produces results at national levels up to 1999 and simulates the potential impact of a partial re-nationalisation of the CAP. Renewed interest for the issue exists for three reasons: 1) Negotiations currently take place in the EU about the 2007 - 2013 financial framework and the initial positions of the large budget contributors call for a reduction in the EU own resources, which is opposed by some other member states. Since the financing of the CAP attracts nearly half of the EU budget, the distribution of the CAP benefits has important implications for these negotiations. 2) Three major reforms of the CAP have taken place (1992, 1999, 2003), which have changed the philosophy of the CAP, moving away from price intervention and towards direct subsidies to the farmers and rural development measures. Yet the distribution results so far stop in 1999 and a need for more recent results exists. 3) It is useful to have a benchmarking of the distribution of benefits before the implementation of the latest CAP reform (2003) and the gradual application of the CAP to the new member states. This study extends the results of Zanias (2002) regarding the distribution of benefits among member states covering the period 1988 - 2003, and focuses on the "anatomy" of the generated transfers and their determinants...|$|E

The purpose of this paper is to review research examining production and trade patterns in global agriculture and extend that line of work to consider commodities that are understudied, yet important in many regions.

This paper investigates differences in price level and price dispersion across off-line and on-line markets and across tour operators and new emerging Internet retailers -including LCCs- using microdata on travel & accommodation individual expenses of tourists in the Balearic Islands, one of the most representative mature Mediterranean resorts. On the basis of the hedonic regression model, results suggest that price of transport; accommodation and board offered on Internet are lower than those offered by others channels, whatever the quality and quantity.

40|$|The {{starting}} point of the present paper {{is the idea that}} to ensure a sustainable development among the Mediterranean countries both of the North and south-east shores, it is necessary to exploit the potentialities of each country and use them in terms of co-development rather then competition. The study area encompasses on the one hand the countries of Central Maghreb {{and on the other hand}} the regions of Southern Italy. This choice is originated by the fact that both these regional groups show similarities and complementarities. The paper analyses the agricultural sector which still has a very dominant position in the socio-economic structure, of both Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria and in the Southern Italian regions, although at a different degree. Therefore that seems to be the sector on which to focus in order to obtain both economic and social improvements. However it is not possible to look at the Mediterranean agricultural sector development only from a free market point of view, for the presence of the same patterns of production activities in the two groups. In order to avoid clashes, it is necessary, instead, to create a production network able to develop a typical <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>product</b> with which to compete in the international markets. In this context Italy, particularly Southern Italian regions, due to its tradition, knowledge and geographical position can play a well defined role of a bridge between the European Union and the third Mediterranean countries. In the first part, we address the question of the existence of a direct relationship between liberalisation and economic growth through the analysis of the commercial flows, in particular the agricultural ones. In the second part the complementarities in the agricultural sector of both the Central Maghreb countries and the Southern Italian regions are identified, while in the third and last part, an attempt is made try to specify how those complementarities can be transformed in concrete co- operation activitiesDevelopment Cooperation, Agriculture, Euro-Mediterranean...|$|R

40|$|The Roman city of Olisipo (Lisbon) {{was one of}} {{the main}} {{harbours}} on the Atlantic façade, with a major role in the circulation of <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>products</b> to the northern provinces. In the Julio-Claudian period it emerged as a major producer of fish products that were packed in amphorae. To analyse and discuss Lusitanian amphorae from this specific period, eight well-dated contexts from excavations in Lisbon (some published, others unpublished), dating from Tiberius to Nero, will be presented. The study of these contexts shows, on the one hand, that amphorae of early Lusitanian type were a major presence, certainly from Claudius or the early days of Nero, and, on the other hand, that the first amphorae presenting the characteristic forms of typical Dressel 14 appear in the stratigraphy only from the AD 60 s onward.

40|$|So far no {{official}} statistical {{data on the}} current status of organic viticulture in Europe exist. Even though most countries in the European Union, the EU accession countries and the EFTA countries collate data on their land under organic management, figures on land use patterns are not always available. The share of organic vineyards of all vineyards is still small. The percentage of organic vineyards is – with the exception of Greece, Italy, Spain - smaller than the percentage of organic land of all agricultural land in the respective countries. This is particularly striking for Austria and Switzerland where only little more than 1 % of the vineyards are organic whereas the total organic land is around eight per cent of all agricultural land. It is also interesting to look at the shares organic vineyards have within the organically managed land. The Mediterranean countries have, compared the northern wine growing areas, high shares of vineyards. This reflects the general cropping pattern but also the fact that most southern countries are exporters of organic products; the main products being typical <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>products,</b> one of which is wine.

40|$|During {{the last}} decade the Cypriot {{agricultural}} sector has been declining in terms of most indices in the economy, mainly due to the spiraling growth of tourism, as crucial investment outlays were diverted from agriculture to tourism; {{the most important factors}} of production being land and labor due to substantially higher yields accruing to both. The Domestic Resource Cost (DRC) revealed that the three products studied for the period 1997 to 2000, i. e. tomatoes, oranges and olive oil had a comparative advantage. However, the opening of the European market with EU accession led to the substantive undermining of competitiveness of agricultural products and to the reduction of the value of exports. It is believed that DRC ratios would be higher today that the ones reported, due to unchanged /decreased border prices and increased costs of tradable inputs. It is suggested that the tomato, orange and olive oil sectors will become more competitive in the European market if factors that are affecting their marketing, like differentiation of production and quality, are improved. New concepts like organic farming and products of origin are very important and may provide profitable outlets in the new globalized economy.
