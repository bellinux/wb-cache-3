40|$|We {{present a}} level of detail (LOD) method {{designed}} for tree branches. It can be combined with methods for processing tree foliage to facilitate navigation through large virtual forests. Starting from a skeletal representation of a tree, we fit polygon meshes of various densities to the skeleton while the mesh density is adjusted according to the required visual fidelity. For distant models, these branch meshes are gradually replaced with semi-transparent lines until the tree recedes to a few lines. Construction of these complete LOD models is guided by error metrics to ensure smooth transitions between adjacent LOD models. We then present an instancing technique for discrete LOD branch models, consisting of polygon <b>meshes</b> <b>plus</b> semi-transparent lines. Line models with different transparencies are instanced on the GPU by merging multiple tree samples into a single model. Our technique reduces the number of draw calls in GPU and increases rendering performance.

40|$|IntroductionSymptomatic {{umbilical}} and/or epigastric hernias {{are often}} seen concomitantly with rectus abdominis diastasis (RAD), and suture repair of such defects {{has a high}} recurrence rate. In the literature {{there are reports of}} both endoscopic and open techniques for repair of symptomatic umbilical and/or epigastric hernias in association with RAD. This paper now reports on the early results of a hybrid technique used for reconstruction of the linea alba and <b>mesh</b> augmentation (ELAR <b>plus).</b> Material and methodsBetween 15 June 2015 and 31 January 2016, 40 patients with symptomatic umbilical and /or epigastric hernia and concomitant RAD underwent reconstruction of the linea alba using a hybrid technique involving a small umbilical incision and the use of video endoscopic equipment. The patients comprised 29 men and 11 women {{with a mean age of}} 53. 6 years and mean BMI of 32. 6. The mean operating time was 120 minutes. The mesh had a mean longitudinal extension of 18. 6 cm and transverse extension of 9. 1 cm. ResultsThirty-day follow-up results are available for all patients. Thirty-seven out of 40 patients (92. 5 %) experienced no postoperative complication. Two cases of discrete impaired umbilical wound healing and one seroma were successfully managed with conservative treatment. On 30 -day follow-up, three out of 40 patients (7. 5 %) complained of intermittent pain on exertion, and two out of 40 patients (5 %) still took painkillers when required.

40|$|We {{present an}} image {{processing}} method that converts a raster image to a simplical 2 -complex which has {{only a small number}} of vertices (base <b>mesh)</b> <b>plus</b> a parameterization that maps each pixel in the original image to a combination of the barycentric coordinates of the triangle it is finally mapped into. Such a conversion of a raster image into a base <b>mesh</b> <b>plus</b> parameterization can be useful for many applications such as segmentation, image retargeting, multi-resolution editing with arbitrary topologies, edge preserving smoothing, compression, etc. The goal of the algorithm is to produce a base mesh such that it has a small colour distortion as well as high shape fairness, and a parameterization that is globally continuous visually and numerically. Inspired by multi-resolution adaptive parameterization of surfaces (MAPS) and quadric error metric (QEM), the algorithm converts pixels in the image to a dense triangle mesh and performs error-bounded simplification jointly considering geometry and colour. The eliminated vertices are projected to an existing face. The implementation is iterative and stops when it reaches a prescribed error threshold. The algorithm is feature sensitive i. e. salient feature edges in the images are preserved where possible and it takes colour into account thereby producing a better quality triangulation...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{study was}} done (1) to {{determine}} whether congenital indirect inguinal hernias in male pigs could be repaired by placing a polypropylene mesh prosthesis over the defect intra-abdominally, (2) to measure the incidence of adhesions between intra-abdominal viscera and the prosthesis with and without the adhesion barrier oxidized regenerated cellulose, (3) to determine the incidence of other complications, and (4) to assess the effect on fertility. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Several techniques for laparoscopic inguinal herniorrhaphy are currently being evaluated {{to determine whether}} there are advantages over conventional inguinal herniorrhaphy. Perhaps the most controversial is the intraperitoneal onlay mesh procedure (IPOM). Its advantage is its simplicity (in that the repair is accomplished by placing a prosthesis over the hernia defect intra-abdominally, avoiding a groin dissection). Its disadvantage is the potential for complications because the prosthesis is in contact with the intra-abdominal viscera. METHODS: In male pigs, polypropylene mesh alone or polypropylene <b>mesh</b> <b>plus</b> the adhesion barrier oxidized regenerated cellulose (composite prosthesis) was fixed to the peritoneum surrounding the hernia defect. In phase 1 (6 -week follow-up), two groups of 13 pigs each underwent herniorrhaphy at laparotomy or laparoscopy. In phase 2 (7. 1 -month follow-up), 21 pigs underwent laparoscopic herniorrhaphy. RESULTS: All IPOM herniorrhaphies were successful. The prostheses adhered most frequently to the bladder, followed by small bowel, peritoneum, and cord structures. Prosthetic erosion into these organs was not observed. Laparoscopically placed prostheses in phases 1 and 2 had significantly less surface covered by adhesions (13 % +/- 13 % and 19 % +/- 27 %, respectively) and a lower adhesion tenacity grade (1. 5 +/- 0. 9 and 1. 3 +/- 1. 1, respectively) than those placed at laparotomy (44 % +/- 27 % and 2. 5 +/- 0. 7, respectively; p < 0. 01). In phase 1, a histologic evaluation of laparoscopically placed specimens demonstrated significantly thinner above-mesh fibrotic tissue compared with the prostheses implanted at laparotomy (p < 0. 04). In either phase, the use of the adhesion barrier did not produce any histologic difference between the polypropylene alone and the composite prosthesis. Fertility studies were performed in phase 2 and showed no adverse effects caused by either prosthesis. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the intraperitoneal placement of a polypropylene prosthesis was an effective technique for indirect inguinal herniorrhaphy in a pig. Furthermore, with laparotomy, the addition of oxidized regenerated cellulose significantly decreased the rate of adhesion formation to the prosthesis. However, oxidized regenerated cellulose would appear to have no value when used with a prosthesis placed laparoscopically...|$|E

40|$|Clock {{distribution}} in VLSI designs is of crucial importance {{and it is}} also a major source of power dissipation of a system. For today’s high performance microprocessors, clock signals are usually distributed by a global clock grid covering the whole chip, followed by post-grid routing that connects clock loads to the clock grid. Early study [7] shows that about 18. 1 % of the total clock capacitance dissipation was due to this post-grid clock routing (i. e., lower <b>mesh</b> wires <b>plus</b> clock twig wires). This post-grid clock routing problem is thus an important one but not many previous works have addressed it. In this paper, we try to solve this problem of connecting clock ports to the clock grid through reserved tracks on multiple metal layers, with delay and slew constraints. Note that a set of routing tracks are reserved for this grid-to-ports clock wires in practice because of the conventional modular design style of high-performance microprocessors. We propose a new expansion algorithm based on the heap data structure to solve the problem effectively. Experimental results on industrial test cases show that our algorithm can improve over the latest work on this problem [10] significantly by reducing the capacitance by 24. 6 % and the wire length by 23. 6 %. We also validate our results using hspice simulation. Finally, our approach is very efficient and for larger test cases with about 2000 ports, the runtime is in seconds...|$|R

Forty-five patients (2. 0 %) had mesh erosion, including 20 vaginal, 17 rectal, 7 rectovaginal fistula, and 1 perineal. Twenty-three patients (51. 1 %) required treatment for minor erosion morbidity (local excision of stitch/exposed mesh), and 18 patients (40. 0 %) were treated for major erosion morbidity (12 laparoscopic mesh removal, 3 <b>mesh</b> removal <b>plus</b> colostomy, and 3 anterior resection). Erosion occurred in 2. 4 % of synthetic meshes and 0. 7 % of biological meshes. The median time to erosion was 23 months. Nonmesh complications occurred in 11. 1 % of patients. LIMITATIONS: This was a retrospective study including patients with minimal follow-up. The study was unable to determine whether patients will develop future erosions, currently have asymptomatic erosions, or have been treated in other institutions for erosions. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic ventral rectopexy is a safe operation. Mesh erosion rates are 2 % and occasionally require resectional surgery that might be reduced by the use of biological graft. An international ventral mesh registry is recommended to monitor mesh problems and to assess whether type of mesh has any impact on functional outcomes or the need for revisional surgery for nonerosion problems...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This {{retrospective}} {{chart analysis}} reports and assesses the long-term (beyond 10  years) safety {{and efficiency of}} a single institution’s experience in 1326 laparoscopic incisional and ventral hernia repairs (LIVHR), defending {{the principle of the}} suturing defect (augmentation repair concept) prior to laparoscopic reinforcement with a composite <b>mesh</b> (IPOM <b>Plus).</b> This study aims to prove the feasibility and validity of IPOM Plus repair, among other concepts, as a well-justified treatment of incisional or ventral hernias, rendering a good long-term outcome result. Methods: A single institution’s systematic retrospective review of 1326 LIVHR was conducted between the years 2000 and 2014. A standardized technique of routine closure of the defect prior to the intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) reinforcement was performed in all patients. The standardized technique of “defect closure” by laparoscopy approximating the linea alba under physiological tension was assigned by either the transparietal U reverse interrupted stitches or the extracorporeal closure in larger defects. All patients benefited from the implant Parietex composite® mesh through an Intraperitoneal Onlay Mesh placement with transfacial suturing. Results: LIVHR was performed on 1326 patients, 52. 57  % female and 47. 43  % male. The majority of our patients were young (mean age 52. 19  years) and obese (average BMI 32. 57  kg/m 2). The mean operating time was 70  min and hospital stay 2  days, with a mean follow-up of 78  months. On the overall early complications of 5. 78  %, we achieved over time the elimination of the dead space by routine closure of the defect, thus reducing seroma formation to 2. 56  %, with a low risk of infection < 1  %. Post-op sepsis occurred in only nine cases. Three secondary serosal breakdowns and two late perforations were re-operated, and three diabetic patients had infected hematomas, necessitating mesh removal. Through technical improvement in the suturing concept and our growing experience, we managed to reduce the incidence of transient pain to a low acceptable rate of 3. 24  % (VAS 5 – 7) that decreased to 2. 56  % on a chronic pain stage, which is comparable to the literature. On the overall rate of late complications of 10. 74  %, we noticed also that by reducing the dead space, the chronic pain, skin bulging, and rate of recurrence were reduced to, respectively, 2. 56, 1. 50, and 4. 72  %. One case of mortality was due to a tracheal stenosis, responsible for an acute respiratory syndrome. On a second-look follow-up of 126 patients (9. 5  %), 45. 23  % were adhesion free, 42. 06  % had minor adhesions classified as Müller I, and 12. 69  % had serosal adhesions classified as Müller II. Conclusion: Our long series confirms the unexpected high rate of feasibility in the suturing concept or augmentation technique, and confers additional benefits to the conventional advantages of LIVHR in terms of reducing the overall morbidity, with a low rate of recurrences. Based on our experience and study, the current best indications for a successful LIVHR procedure should be tailored upon the limitations of the defect’s width and proper patient selection, to restore adequately the optimal functionality of the abdominal muscles and provide better functional and cosmetic outcomes.

No trap may be used to take spot prawns from May 1 through July 31 between a line drawn due west from Point Arguello, Santa Barbara County, and the California-Oregon boundary. (1) Spot prawn traps may be set and baited no earlier than 0600 hours (6 : 00 a. m.) on January 31 in waters south of a line drawn due west from Point Arguello, and no earlier than 0600 hours (6 : 00 a. m.) on July 31 in waters north of a line drawn due west from Point Arguello. (2) In areas in which the season closure begins November 1, all traps must be removed from the water prior to November 1, weather and sea conditions permitting. In areas in which the season closure begins May 1, all traps must be removed from the water prior to May 1, weather and sea conditions permitting. In the event that a permittee is unable to comply with this subdivision, then that person must notify the nearest department office via telephone or FAX and certified mail not later than 1600 hours (4 : 00 p. m.) on November 1 or May 1, whichever is applicable, stating the reason for the delay and the anticipated date of trap removal. Notification does not relieve the permittee of responsibility for complying with this subdivision unless approved by the department. (3) All spot prawns taken in any trap during the closed season shall be immediately returned to the water and no spot prawn may be possessed aboard, or landed from, any vessel operating under authority of a spot prawn trap permit in any area during the closed season in that area.
