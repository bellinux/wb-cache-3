The results obtained were as follows: 1) Monohalogenated benzenes decrease state 3 respiration and increase state 4 respiration, resulting in a decrease in both respiratory control (RCI) and the ADP/O ratio. 2) The above activity is in the decreasing order of iodobenzene, bromobenzene, chlorobenzene and fluorobenzene. This order of activity is parallel to that of potassium releasing activity. 3) Similarly {{to the effect of}} monohalogenated benzenes, brominated hydrocarbons also decrease both RCI and the ADP/O ratio.

40|$|This {{contribution}} reports {{results from}} the gas-phase oxidation of 4 -bromo- 4 '-chlorobiphenyl (4, 4 '-BCB) in order to fathom the formation of toxic species produced during the combustion of mixed halogenated aromatics. In their own right, mixed polybrominated/polychlorinated biphenyls (PXBs) represent {{a new class of}} environmental contaminants, recently detected in food and human tissues. Gas chromatography-quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC-QMS), gas chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (GC-QTOFMS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and ion chromatography (IC) served to analyse the volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds (V/SVOCs), including mixed halogenated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PXDD/Fs), and gaseous products including HBr/HCl. The selection of non-ortho substituted PXB as a model species yields a large number of halogenated compounds, including monochloro- and <b>monobromobenzene</b> and higher halogenated benzenes and naphthalenes and derivatives of halogenated benzenes (such as 1 -chloro- 4 -ethynylbenzene). We also detect small amounts of chlorinated and mixed halogenated dibenzofurans. The present study provides insights into the formation of several classes of halogenated and mixed-halogenated pollutants in combustion processes involving both bromine and chlorine sources, such as those of brominated flame retardants and PVC plastics...|$|E
40|$|Brominated {{flame retardants}} (BFRs) are bromine-bearing {{hydrocarbons}} added or applied to materials {{to increase their}} fire resistance. As thermal treatment or recycling activities are common disposal methods for BFR-laden objects, {{it is essential to}} determine the precise decomposition chemistry of BFRs at elevated temperatures, and their transformation pathways into hazardous pollutants. Sunlight can trigger the photodecomposition of BFRs, either during the life cycle of treated objects, or when emitted to the environment after disposal. Therefore, knowledge of the geometric and electronic structures of BFRs is of chief importance when tracking their fate in the ambient environment. Although BFR decomposition mainly occurs in a condensed phase, gas phase reactions also contribute significantly to their overall decay and subsequent fragmentation into brominated pollutants. Thermal degradation of BFRs often proceeds in the presence of bromine atoms which inhibit complete combustion. Therefore, under thermal conditions such as smouldering, municipal waste incineration, pyrolysis, thermal recycling, uncontrolled burning and fires, BFRs degrade to form brominated products of incomplete combustion (BPICs). Thermal degradation of BFRs produces potent precursors to polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PBDD/Fs). Co-combustion of BFR-containing objects with a chlorine source (e. g., polyvinyl chlorides) results in the emission of significant concentrations of mixed halogenated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (i. e., PXDD/Fs; X = Br, Cl). In this thesis, we investigated the thermochemical parameters of bromochlorophenols (BCPhs) and the photodecomposition properties of major BFRs and their derived brominated phenols (BPhs). We scrutinised the formation of brominated and non-brominated products that evolved during the thermal decomposition of major BFR i. e., tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBA), through experimental measurements coupled with accurate quantum chemical calculations. We acquired thermo-kinetic parameters as well as mechanistic routes pertinent to the destruction of TBBA. We illustrated reaction networks for the synthesis of PXDD/Fs from BPhs and chlorinated phenols (CPhs). Similarly, we described pathways leading to the formation of PBDFs and polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs) from brominated benzenes (BBzs). We critically reviewed the literature on BFR thermal decomposition with specific foci on underlying mechanisms, decomposition products, the influence of the polymeric matrix, metallic content and operational conditions. As BCPhs are direct building blocks for the formation of PXDD/Fs, we computed the thermochemical parameters of their complete series. We calculated standard enthalpies of formation, entropies, heat capacities and bond dissociation enthalpies (BDHs) of O-H bonds for the complete series of BCPhs. Values of the acid dissociation constant (pKa) were estimated based on an accurate thermodynamic cycle incorporating solvation and protonation energies. Calculated values of BDHs of O-H bonds in BCPhs vary slightly with the change in degree and pattern of halogenation. Gibbs energies of solvation of BCPhs in water are highly exergonic, with their values increasing with the degree of halogen substitution. Values of pKa dictate that BCPhs characterised by high degrees of halogenation display stronger acidity and dissociate more easily in aqueous media (i. e., they are stronger acids than lower substituted phenols). Photolysis and photochemical decomposition are important channels for the degradation of halogenated organic pollutants in the environment. Therefore, we performed density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TDFT) calculations in order to derive the photodecomposition properties of major deployed BFRs and congeners of BPhs in both gaseous and aqueous media. We clarified the effect of degree and pattern of bromination on the photodebromination of selected brominated aromatic compounds based on several molecular descriptors; namely, geometries of the ground (S 0) and electronically first excited (S 1) states, values of the HOMO-LUMO energy gap (EH-L) and atomic charges on bromine atoms (qBr). Molecules exhibit different geometries in the S 0 and S 1 states and C-Br bonds elongate upon S 0 → S 1 transitions. In agreement with the recent findings on PBDEs, we found that the photoreactivity of bromine atoms in investigated BFRs and BPhs followed the sequence of ortho > meta > para. The bromine atom connected to the ortho-position holds the highest positive atomic charge and, thus, experiences the greatest lengthening of C-Br bonds in the S 1 state, in both gaseous and an aqueous media, prompting their reductive debromination. Excitation energies decrease linearly with increasing numbers of bromine substituents, and congeners {{with a high degree of}} bromination photodecompose more readily than lower brominated isomers. Computed values of EH-L for major BFRs and their non-brominated molecules inferred that the number of bromine substituents and the nature of the structure (aromatic/non-aromatic) contributes significantly towards the photoreactivity of molecules. We conducted gas phase thermal decomposition of TBBA using a laboratory-scale tubular reactor. Our main focus was to identify pollutants arising in the temperature range of 673 – 1123 K following evaporation of TBBA in the gas phase. The identification and quantitation involved the use of a gas chromatograph – triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (GC-QQQMS) instrument, functioning in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) and total ion current (TIC) modes. Product analysis revealed that thermal decomposition of TBBA commenced at 723 K. The major decomposition products were HBr, di-tribrominated bisphenols, benzene, phenol, mono-tribrominated congeners of benzene and phenol, brominated and non-brominated alkylated benzenes, benzofuran, bromobenzofuran, dibenzofuran, bromine substituted polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), biphenyl and biphenylene. We observed that, most of the decomposition products evolved in trivial concentrations at a temperature of 773 K and peaked at around 923 – 973 K. Higher temperatures favour the generation of non-brominated products. In this chapter, we have performed quantum chemical calculations to derive the degradation pathways of TBBA and to illustrate routes for the formation of brominated and non-brominated species. We constructed formation mechanisms related to the emission of PBDD/Fs in systems involving BFRs. In particular, we investigated formation corridors of (i) PXDD/Fs from the coupling reactions of 2 -chlorophenoxy (2 -CPhxy) and 2 -bromophenoxy (2 -BPhxy) radicals, (ii) PBDFs and PBDEs synthesis from the condensation reaction of <b>monobromobenzene</b> (MBBz) and a 2 -BPhxy radical. The coupling reactions of 2 -BPhxy and 2 -CPhxy radicals produce keto-ether (through the additions of a phenoxy O at ortho C(H), C(Cl) and C(Br) sites) and diketo (at ortho positions to C–C bridges) structures. Keto-ethers act as direct intermediates for the formation of dioxin moieties such as dibenzo-p-dioxin (DD), 1 -monochlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (1 -MCDD), 1 -monobromodibenzo-p-dioxin (1 -MBDD), 1 -bromo- 6 -chlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (1 -B, 6 -CDD) and 1 -bromo- 9 -chlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (1 -B, 9 -CDD) molecules. Diketo adducts initiate the formation of furan species, i. e., 4 -monochlorodibenzofuran (4 -MCDF), 4 -monobromodibenzofuran (4 -MBDF) and 4 -bromo- 6 -chlorodibenzofuran (4 -B, 6 -CDF) compounds, through interconversion and rearrangement reactions. We found that, these mechanisms of formation, commencing from halogenated phenoxy radicals, are largely insensitive to patterns and degrees of halogenation on meta and para sites. It follows that, our developed mechanistic and kinetic factors of reactions involving 2 -BPhxy and 2 -CPhxy should also apply to higher halogenated phenoxy radicals. We explored the initial oxidative decomposition pathways of <b>monobromobenzene</b> (MBBz) in the generation of BPhxy radicals and examined the possible dimerisation reactions of MBBz and 2 -BPhxy. It was found that, the coupling of MBBz and 2 -BPhxy results in the generation of twelve pre-PBDF intermediates, of which four can also serve as building blocks for the synthesis of PBDEs. The resonance-stabilised structure of the o-BPhxy radical accumulates more spin density character on its phenoxy O atom (30. 9...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis {{provides}} {{an assessment of}} the toxic pollutants formed during the thermal decomposition of polychlorinated (PCBs) and mixed halogenated (i. e., simultaneously chlorinated and brominated) biphenyls (PXBs; X = Cl/Br), under gas phase conditions similar to those occurring in fires, and in other combustion processes. (For convenience, in this thesis, the term polychlorinated biphenyls also comprises monochlorinated biphenyls.) In particular, we have investigated the oxidation of 4 -chlorobiphenyl (4 -CB), 4, 4 ’-dichlorobiphenyl (4, 4 ’-DCB) and 4 -bromo, 4 ’-chlorobiphenyl (4, 4 ’-BCB), at temperatures lower than those leading to complete conversion of PCBs and PXBs to HBr, HCl, H 2 O and CO 2. The presence of chlorine and bromine in the molecules indicates the propensity for releasing highly toxic chlorinated and mixed halogenated volatiles (VOCs) in combustion processes. In addition, previous studies reported polychlorinated biphenyls, which were widely used as transformer oil in capacitors, to form polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs). The work covered by this thesis was designed to examine the type and abundance of pollutants formed in incomplete oxidation of PCBs and PXBs and to gain an understanding into the effect of structural differences among the reactants on the reaction mechanisms responsible for the formation of pollutants. In addition, we examined the effect of three materials of construction of the reactors: alumina (99. 5 %), quartz (99. 95 %) and quartz with boron-oxide coating on the reactor walls. Initially, we studied the same reactant (4 -CB) in the three reactors, to understand the effect of impurities (trace amount of transition metals) and surface generated singlet oxygen on the reaction mechanisms responsible for the pollutant formation. We established a laboratory-scale apparatus that consisted of a laminar flow reactor equipped with a sampling system for intercepting the volatile and condensable products. A XAD- 2 cartridge served to trap the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and PCDD/Fs. The analysis of VOCs involved high resolution gas chromatography – quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC-QMS) while HRGC – ion trap MS (GC-ITMS) quantitated the PCDD/Fs produced. The development of reaction mechanisms involved the application of Gaussian 09 suite of programs. We optimised structures and calculated the zero point vibrational energies (ZPVE) at the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G(d), B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 G(d,p) and M 062 X/ 6 - 311 +G(d,p) levels of theory. Stationary points located were either minima or transition states (TSs) determined by vibrational frequency analysis wherein a transition structure contained just one imaginary frequency along the specified reaction coordinates. Intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) analysis afforded linking the reactants and products with their TSs. The thermal decomposition of 4 -CB in the alumina reactor produces a number of volatile pollutants, including chlorophenols and chlorobenzenes, which are important precursors for the formation of PCDD/Fs. Other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected included (chloro) benzaldehydes, (chloro) naphthalenes, one isomer of ethylbenzaldehyde, 1 -chloro- 4 -ethynylbenzene and dibenzofuran. The results of the thermal decomposition of 4 -CB also indicate the formation of mono to octa-CDD/Fs at high temperatures, with 3 -monochlorodibenzofuran (3 -MCDF) being the most abundant CDD/Fs formed. Gas products were identified and quantitated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), with hydrogen chloride quantitated by ion chromatography (IC). The results from IC analysis afforded accurate quantitation of the formation of HCl in pyrolysis experiments. The oxidation of 4 -CB in quartz reactor and quartz tube with boron-oxide coating on the reactor surfaces revealed the formation of similar VOCs and gas products, but in a different temperature window. The first product observed in the alumina reactor, benzaldehyde, initially appeared at around 300 °C, and at 450 °C and 500 °C in quartz and boron-oxide-coated quartz reactor, respectively. The onset temperatures of other VOCs products, such as PCBzs and PCPs formed in three reactors, rank as follow: boron-oxide-coated quartz reactor > quartz reactor > alumina reactor. In addition, we observed the formation of all homologue groups of PCDD/Fs but only in the alumina reactor. In quartz and boron-oxide-coated reactors, we only observed mono and diCDD/Fs. In all three reactors, 3 -MCDF constituted the most abundant congener. The current measurements report the distinct mechanisms operating on reactor surfaces and in gas phase; the former appearing {{as a consequence of the}} transition metal impurities in the reactor walls and surface-generated singlet oxygen, which were neglected in previous studies. Our findings are of great practical significance as all studies on the thermal decomposition of PCB performed in the 20 th century involved glass ampoule reactors. This means that, the results of the previous investigation, especially the product speciation, must be treated with caution, due to confounding effects of the homogenous and heterogeneous reaction mechanisms. On the basis of the results of the thermal decomposition of 4 -CB, we investigated the decomposition of 4, 4 ’-DCB in the boron-oxide-coated quartz reactor, in order to study the pollutants formed and to elucidate their reaction mechanisms. Benzene, chlorobenzene, phenol and 4 -chlorophenol (4 -CP) were found as the PCDD/F precursors, with chlorobenzene as the dominant species. We identified 2 -chloronaphthalene as the main VOC product with smaller amount of naphthalene, and even smaller abundance of 1 -chloronaphthalene. This indicates that, 2 -chloronaphthalene forms directly from 4, 4 ’-DCB, with possible 1, 2 -Cl shift in 2 -chloronaphthalene producing 1 -chloronaphthalene. Similar mechanism operates for the appearance of 4 -chlorobenzaldehyde (forming benzaldehyde, and then 3 -chlorobenzaldehyde), 1 -chloro- 4 -ethynylbenzene (dechlorinating to 1 -ethynylbenzene) and 1 -chloro- 4 -(1 -propynyl) -benzene (producing 1 -chloro- 6 -(1 -propynyl) -benzene, via dechlorination of 1 -propynylbenzene, H abstraction and then chlorination at a different carbon atom). We found a small amount of 1 -propynylbenzene in the experiments conducted at 625 and 650 ºC, and with this species acting as a source for other isomers of chloropropynylbenzenes. We also detected benzofuran from 625 – 700 °C. The formation of PCDD/Fs included only MCDF, MCDD, DCDF and a minute amount of DCDD. Note that, 3 -MCDF was observed first at 550 °C above a background level of 0. 2 ng/(g 4, 4 ’-DCB). This temperature is about 250 °C higher than that of the first observation of PCDD/Fs in the alumina reactor. We also studied the thermal decomposition of PXB with 4 -bromo- 4 ’-chlorobiphenyl (4, 4 ’-BCB) as a probe molecule to gain insights into the effect of combined sources of chlorine and bromine on formation of mixed halogenated pollutants. The oxidation of 4, 4 ’-BCB in the B 2 O 3 -coated reactor revealed the formation of species similar to those appearing in fires of brominated flame retardants (BFR) and municipal waste combustion; i. e., in systems characterising both bromine and chlorine sources. The gas products detected included HCl, CO, CO 2, C 2 H 2 and HBr. To improve elemental balances of chlorine and bromine, we employed ion chromatography (IC) for quantitation of HCl and HBr. With increasing temperature, the concentration of HCl and HBr increased dramatically, in similar concentrations. We detected benzene, <b>monobromobenzene,</b> monochlorobenzene, one congener of mixed halogenated benzenes, one congener of mixed halogenated phenols, bromonaphthalenes, chloronaphthalenes, 6 -bromobenzofuran, chlorobenzofurans, dibenzofuran, mixed halogenated ethynylbenzenes and chlorobenzaldehydes. Similar chlorinated species also formed in the oxidation of 4 -CB and 4, 4 ’-DCB. In addition, we observed the formation of one congener of PXDD/Fs by deploying a GC-QTOFMS (high resolution gas chromatography – quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry) to elucidate the reaction products. The accurate calculations of molecular mass and isotopic distribution revealed the formation of monobromochlorodibenzofuran. We also observed significant amount of 3 -MCDF and one congener of DCDF (3, 7 -DCDF formed from the impurity 4, 4 ’-DCB) in our experiments. We did not detect any PBDD/Fs. The quantum chemical calculations yielded the reaction pathways and provided reaction mechanisms for the pollutants observed in the experiments. These mechanisms comprise direct formation of VOCs and dioxins from 4, 4 ’-BCB by its partial oxidation (for example, by adding an oxygen bridge between the two aryl rings to form dioxins) and synthesis of two- and three-ring species from primary decomposition fragments, such as chlorophenoxys and chlorobenzenes...|$|E
