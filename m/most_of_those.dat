5|$|Between {{the end of}} the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising (May 1943) and {{beginning}} of 1944, there were between 10,000 and 20,000 Jews hiding in the Ghetto ruins. The number of Robinsons after the Warsaw Uprising has been estimated at between several hundred and two thousand, spread across all the suburbs of Warsaw. Another source gives the number as between 400 and 1,000. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> hiding were Jewish, including some who had been in hiding since the fall of the ghetto uprising, though a significant number were non-Jewish Poles. Unlike Szpilman, whose case was somewhat unrepresentative, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> in hiding remained in medium-sized to large groups, often of mixed ethnicities. The majority of the Robinsons were men.|$|E
5|$|An early {{estimate}} by the Small Business Administration put total {{damage in}} Gilroy {{at twice the}} amount of what was seen in Hollister. Ten people were brought to Hazel Hawkins Memorial Hospital in Hollister for treatment of lacerations, a cardiac problem, and anxiety. In Gilroy, the Wheeler Hospital saw six similar cases and a patient with a fractured hip. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> that sought care (including four that were transported by ambulance) were treated and released, but six were admitted.|$|E

5|$|Historically, auls were a Circassian type {{of rural}} locality. Many of the present-day auls were founded during 1850 to 1925, when the Adyghe people {{were subject to}} mass deportations as a {{consequence}} of the Caucasian War of 1817–1864. These auls tend to be located in mountainous or otherwise difficult-to-access terrains, while <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> established after the Caucasian War are found on the plains beside the Caucasus Mountains.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, 144 {{people lived}} in Rivington, 63 males and 81 females. There were 48 {{households}} of which 34 lived in detached houses and 14 in terraced or semi-detached properties. Most households, 60%, were owner-occupied; the remainder were privately rented. The {{mean age of the}} population was 53.4 years. In 2001 <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> employed, 47, worked in the service industries. Ten worked in extractive and manufacturing industries, and threemales were unemployed.

5|$|Many riders used normal {{road race}} bikes for this stage, as {{the course is}} highly {{atypical}} for a time trial, with roads that were not flat and straight. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> riders altered their road race bikes with the aerodynamic handlebars of a time trial bike, but some, including race leader Danilo Di Luca, did not. The climbs in the stage increased the overall chances for strong climbers who are relatively weak time trialists, such as Damiano Cunego and Gilberto Simoni.|$|E
5|$|<b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> {{who died}} (comprising 78% of the {{fugitive}} victims) were young men aged between 16 and 30.

5|$|Norwich re-appointed Gunn {{as manager}} for the 2009–10 season. Crook, as first team coach, and former Canary Ian Butterworth, as {{assistant}} manager, completed the management team.

5|$|Oil {{production}} was slowed {{as a result}} of Humberto, as at least four refineries—the Valero, ExxonMobil, Total SA and Motiva Enterprises LLC plants in Port Arthur—were halted due to the loss of power. Oil prices rose above $80 a barrel in intraday trading on September 12 as a result, ending the next day at a record high of $80.09 a barrel.

5|$|Thomas succeeded Ealdred as Archbishop of York in 1070; he was {{nominated}} on 23May and was probably consecrated on 25December.

The appointment was more consistent with English norms, as <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> appointed to the English episcopate before the Conquest had previously been royal clerks.|$|E

5|$|Although spiders {{are widely}} feared, {{only a few}} species are {{dangerous}} to people. Spiders will only bite humans in self-defense, and few produce worse effects than a mosquito bite or bee-sting. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> with medically serious bites, such as recluse spiders and widow spiders, would rather flee and bite only when trapped, although this can easily arise by accident. Funnel web spiders' defensive tactics include fang display and their venom, although they rarely inject much, has resulted in 13 known human deaths over 50 years. They have been deemed to be the world's most dangerous spiders on clinical and venom toxicity grounds, though this claim has also been attributed to the Brazilian wandering spider, due to much more frequent accidents.|$|E

5|$|At {{its peak}} in May 1945, 82,000 people were {{employed}} at the Clinton Engineer Works, and 75,000 people lived in the township. By January 1946, these figures had fallen to 43,000 and 48,000 respectively. By the time the Manhattan Project concluded {{at the end of}} 1946, the corresponding figures were 34,000 and 43,000. The departure of large numbers of construction workers meant that 47 percent of those remaining were family members of workers. Eight dormitories were closed in October 1945. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who remained in dorms now had their own rooms. The white hutments began to be removed.

Location filming in Alabama was delayed by inclement weather; during the Calloway circus scenes filming, a tornado watch was issued and flooding on the set interrupted filming for several weeks. Despite the delays, Burton delivered the film on budget and on schedule.|$|E
5|$|Charles counted his regnal {{years from}} this coronation, but Hungary had {{actually}} disintegrated into {{about a dozen}} independent provinces, each ruled by a powerful lord, or oligarch. Among them, Matthew Csák dominated the northwestern parts of Hungary (which now form the western territories of present-day Slovakia), Amadeus Aba controlled the northeastern lands, Ivan Kőszegi ruled Transdanubia, and Ladislaus Kán governed Transylvania. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> lords refused to accept Charles's rule and proposed the crown to Wenceslaus II of Bohemia's son and namesake, Wenceslaus, whose bride, Elisabeth, was AndrewIII's only daughter. Although Wenceslaus was crowned with the Holy Crown in Székesfehérvár, the legitimacy of his coronation was also questionable because John Hont-Pázmány, Archbishop of Kalocsa, put the crown on Wenceslaus's head, although customary law authorized the Archbishop of Esztergom to perform the ceremony.|$|E
