500|$|By {{making the}} biopic, Dodd Darin and Spacey {{acknowledged}} the similar career experiences between Darin and Spacey. [...] "A {{lot of people}} doubted my dad's abilities, and Kevin's had doubters and naysayers," [...] Dodd commented. [...] "But both [...] {{were willing to take}} risks, and both were very resilient. <b>My</b> <b>dad</b> <b>would</b> always try new things. You could never pin him down. Kevin's career is similar." [...] David Evanier, author of Roman Candle: The Life of Bobby Darin (...) , said [...] "You can put Kevin's obsessiveness about getting the film made right up there with Bobby's obsessiveness. He's also the ideal person to play Bobby. He has an uncanny physical resemblance to him, and he also has Bobby's intensity and dark side. Also, there's the connection with his mother. Bobby's mother's belief in him sent him soaring. Kevin's mother wanted him to make this film. Kevin sees the film as an act of devotion to his mother." ...|$|E
500|$|One {{day after}} his father {{died of a heart}} attack or stroke, Favre decided to play in a December 22, 2003, Monday Night Football game against the Oakland Raiders. The Packers {{traveled}} to Oakland where Favre passed for four touchdowns in the first half and 399 total yards in a 41–7 victory over the Raiders on international television (even receiving applause from [...] "Raider Nation"). He completed 73.3% of his passes and finished the game with a passer rating of 154.9 with having recorded a perfect 158.3 rating with four touchdowns and over 250 yards passing by halftime (a feat accomplished by only four other passers in NFL history). Afterwards, Favre said, [...] "I knew that <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> <b>would</b> have wanted me to play. I love him so much and I love this game. It's meant a great deal to me, to my dad, to my family, and I didn't expect this kind of performance. But I know he was watching tonight." [...] After the game, he went to his father's funeral in Pass Christian, Mississippi. Favre won an ESPY Award for his Monday Night Football performance.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to Scuzzlebutt, [...] "Volcano" [...] included the first appearances of recurring characters Randy Marsh and Ned Gerblanski. In this first appearance, Randy is identified {{only as the}} South Park geologist, {{and it is only}} in the episode [...] "An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig" [...] that he is first introduced as Stan's father. Parker, who provides the voice of Randy Marsh, said the design, voice, and personality of the character are based on his real-life father, who works as a geologist for the United States Geological Survey. Parker said his father is very calm in real life and Randy's relaxed reaction to learning of the volcano—calmly sipping his coffee—is [...] "about how <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> <b>would</b> react to anything". The look of the Ned character was based on a drawing Parker made in high school, although the character did not originally have a voice box. The voice was inspired by a waitress who worked at a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in Boulder, Colorado, where Parker and Stone would visit while attending the University of Colorado. The duo said they would go to the restaurant just to hear her voice, but that it was so low they would lose their appetite when she took their orders. Stone and Parker had trouble creating the right voice for the character; they tried putting the microphone directly on their throat, and also bought an actual voice box, but ultimately decided that the best way to provide the character's voice was with natural voice simulation.|$|E
2500|$|Heap {{states that}} her song lyrics come from {{personal}} experience, {{but are not}} straightforwardly confessional. She has stated [...] "Most of the time, the lyrics are kind of like my secret messages to my friends or my boyfriend or my mum or <b>my</b> <b>dad.</b> I <b>would</b> never tell them that these songs are about them or which specific lyric is about somebody. Often, when I sit down to write a lyric, {{it is in the}} heat of the moment, and something has just happened." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Hello Stranger" [...] {{was written}} by Barbara Lewis herself, who was {{originally}} inspired to write a song with that title while working gigs in Detroit with her musician father: “I would make the circuit with <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> and people <b>would</b> yell out: ‘Hey stranger, hello stranger, it’s been a long time’". The song is notable because its title comprises the first two words of the lyrics but is never at any point repeated {{throughout the rest of}} the song.|$|R
500|$|As a child, Downey was [...] "surrounded by drugs". His father, a drug addict, allowed Downey to use {{marijuana}} at age six, {{an incident}} which {{his father has}} said he now regrets. Downey later stated that drug use became an emotional bond {{between him and his}} father: [...] "When <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> and I <b>would</b> do drugs together, it was like him trying to express his love for me in the only way he knew how." [...] Eventually, Downey began spending every night abusing alcohol and [...] "making a thousand phone calls in pursuit of drugs".|$|R

6000|$|... "But we'll be straight," [...] said Bessie, {{half an hour}} later, apropos of nothing. [...] "But gee! it's fierce to {{not have}} any good times without you take a risk. But gee! <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> <b>would</b> kill me if I went wrong. He reads the Talmud all the time, and hates Goys. But gee! I can't stand {{it all the time}} being a mollycoddle. I wisht I was a boy! I'd be a' aviator." ...|$|E
5000|$|Talia {{described}} how she evolved from straight forward country music to bawdy comedy, when first living in Nashville, [...] "I did gigs around town and I was always asked {{to play an}} Australian song. For me, the first 'Australian' song that popped into my head was always one of <b>my</b> <b>Dad's...</b> I <b>would</b> change the words around a bit and make it from a girl's point of view. This quickly took {{on a life of}} its own and within months, I had written and recorded a comedy album, which went on to outsell my three previous country albums in a matter of months. I joined Dad on a 72-date tour of Europe as his opening act, which turned out to be a huge success." [...] Her first album as a comedian was Jenny Talia from Australia in 2003.|$|R
5000|$|I biked {{to school}} every day, about 25km there and back. My mum would say, {{if you go}} on your bike it will make you stronger. I think it did... In the {{countryside}} I was always outside, kind of like a tomboy... I never even thought about my looks. We didn't have social media so we couldn't look at other girls and pictures from magazines. We didn't really buy a lot of magazines; <b>my</b> mum and <b>dad</b> <b>would</b> just read papers... I felt super-young coming from the north of Holland, and I went to Amsterdam only once before I went to New York City.|$|R

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with The AU Interview, he said the bands that influenced him into starting a band were [...] "Korn, Deftones, Slayer, Sepultura... everything that <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> <b>would</b> buy and bring home {{to me and my}} brother saying ‘Hey, listen to this.’" ...|$|E
5000|$|... “My dad {{believed}} in Rich’s music,” said Oteri Jr., {{who is now}} publishing Fagan’s songs through his Broadminded Music company. “I can’t let all the work they did go to waste. I grew up around Rich, and I’ve known him all my life, and I know that what happened was an accident. I have to let Rich keep going. It’s what <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> <b>would</b> want.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Lee Trevino said of Sifford, [...] "You {{have to put}} him in the Jackie Robinson category". Tiger Woods {{referred}} to Sifford as [...] "the Grandpa I never had," [...] and that, without Sifford, [...] "I probably wouldn't be here. <b>My</b> <b>dad</b> <b>would</b> have never have picked up the game.

6000|$|... "I {{knew you}} {{directly}} I heard your voice, sir," [...] the man answered. [...] "It {{seemed to take}} me back to a night many years ago--I want you to let me remind you of it. I should like you to know that I never forgot it. We were at St. John's then; you were right above me--in a different world altogether. You were a leader amongst the best of them, and I was a hanger-on amongst the worst. You were in with the gentlemen set and the reading set. Neither of them would {{have anything to do with}} me--and they were quite right. I was what they thought me--a cad. I'd no head for work, and no taste for anything worth doing, and I wasn't a gentleman, and hadn't sense to behave like one. I'd no right to have been at the University at all, but <b>my</b> poor old <b>dad</b> <b>would</b> have me go. He had an idea that he could make a gentleman of me. It was a mistake!" ...|$|R

5000|$|Around {{the final}} turn, <b>My</b> <b>Dad</b> George responded along {{the rail and}} {{squeezed}} {{by most of the}} leaders and front runner Silent Screen.

Personality won by a neck over <b>My</b> <b>Dad</b> George. [...] <b>My</b> <b>Dad</b> George finished over three lengths in front of Silent Screen and was another two in front of High Echelon in fourth.

5000|$|I {{remember}} my parents sneaking me {{in to see}} Young Frankenstein. We would also watch Saturday Night Live, or Monty Python, or old Marx Brothers movies. <b>My</b> <b>dad</b> <b>would</b> let us stay up late to watch The Honeymooners.

5000|$|In February 2014 Bradford Grammar School was {{the first}} amateur group to have {{performed}} the play. It is so far the only school ever to have performed this play, with Daniel Sanderson taking the title role of Robert Johnson. Tom Priestley, the son of J.B.

5000|$|Enninful {{described}} his brief career modeling as his [...] "baptism into fashion". By {{the age of}} 17, he had been introduced to Trish and Terry Jones, founder of i-D magazine, and soon began assisting i-D fashion director Beth Summers. He finished college, earning a degree at Goldsmiths, University of London ("Barely, but otherwise <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> <b>would</b> have killed me.") while juggling his modeling career and assisting on shoots with Foxton and Summers.

I've been rushing from picture to picture, like a kid let loose in an art gallery for the first time. You see, it's so awful recent that I've found there was a world--well, a world where beautiful things counted. I was on the farm till I was nineteen. Dad is a good farmer, but nothing else. Do you know why he first sent me off to learn tailoring? I wanted to study drawing, {{and he had a}} cousin that'd {{made a lot of money}} tailoring out in Dakota, and he said tailoring was a lot like drawing, so he sent me down to a punk hole called Curlew, to work in a tailor shop. Up to that time I'd only had three months' schooling a year--walked to school two miles, through snow up to <b>my</b> knees--and <b>Dad</b> never <b>would</b> stand for my having a single book except schoolbooks.|$|R
40|$|When I was {{six years}} old <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> told me he grew up in a {{religious}} cult called Wisdom Knowledge Faith Love Fountain of the World, where a man he called “the master” said he was the second coming of Christ- turns out he wasn’t. When <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> was twelve, two disgruntled members, blew up the building my grandparents and uncle were sleeping in and they died. I had a lot of questions, but <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> didn’t have many answers because he blocked much of the experience out – as many survivors of trauma do. This half-hour film documents my quest for the truth of <b>my</b> <b>dad’s</b> mysterious childhood. Why did my grandparents join a cult? How did <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> and uncle cope growing up barefoot with long braids in LA public schools during an era of crew cuts? How did they cope with the loss of their parents and assimilation back into mainstream culture? In order to tell the story I travel with <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> and uncle to the places of their childhood, all the time trying to get <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> to answer questions he couldn’t in the past. This story of a daughter probing into family history touches on the early days of a counter culture movement and the effects on one family involved. Even though I set out to understand my grandparents in the end I learned more about <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> and uncle’s survival as our relationship deepened through the filmmaking process...|$|R

"Purely as an {{exercise}} in 'Can I write something <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> <b>would</b> like?'", Kelly Marcel produced a treatment for Terra Nova while working in Prime Time Video, a video rental shop in Battersea.
