It ended with a European conference of parliamentarians and non-governmental organisations (Madrid, 1-3 June 1988), which launched the <b>Madrid</b> <b>Appeal.</b> The <b>Madrid</b> <b>Appeal</b> laid the foundations for a dynamic dialogue between North and South in a spirit of respect for democracy and human dignity in order to allow all the world's inhabitants to enjoy fair, balanced and sustainable development.The Portuguese government then proposed setting up a European Centre for Global Interdependence and Solidarity, a proposal supported by the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly in a recommendation adopted in January 1989.The North-South Centre, was established in Lisbon in May 1990 with the purpose of promoting dialogue between North and South, fostering solidarity and raising awareness of global interdependence.The Centre fulfils a dual political role of representing [...] "the voice of the South" [...] within the Council of Europe and of promoting and transmitting the values of democracy and human rights that are central to the Council of Europe's mission in neighbouring regions.The Centre strives to promote gender empowerment, youth participation and democratic consolidation through intercultural dialogue in cooperation with civil society, local authorities, governments and parliaments.|$|E

It was not until early in January 1945, that Lombardi was finally permitted leave Madrid. The British Foreign Office had notified the embassy in Madrid: [...] "Allied Forces have withdrawn their objection and the lady is free to return to Italy..." [...] Churchill had ultimately come to Lombardi’s rescue, as verified in a classified communication written to Churchill four days later from Allied Headquarters in Paris. Lombardi expressed her gratitude to Churchill in a letter she wrote him in May 1945: [...] "Thank you with all my heart for what you found time to do for me..." ...|$|R
5000|$|In April 2012, {{three months}} before Carromero {{travelled}} to Cuba, the Spanish Directorate General of Traffic had initiated the administrative process of revoking his driver's license and issued the due public notice on May 18. The withdrawal did not take effect until after the process was completed and the official withdrawal notice was published on August 9, 2012. The withdrawal procedure was the consequence of two traffic offenses since Carromero had acquired his license: A speeding violation from August 18, 2009 cost him 6 of his 8 total credit points as a novice driver under the Spanish points system, before he finally lost the remaining points for a single offense of speaking with a mobile phone in his hand while driving. The speeding ticket was for riding at 145 km/h on the Madrid-Valencia motorway with a speed limit of 120 km/h. The fine was aggravated by the fact that, as a novel driver in his second year, Carromero was to keep below a general maximum speed of 90 km/h. Carromero's driving record was incorrectly reported by various Spanish media starting in early August 2012 while he was held in solitary confinement in a cell at the [...] "100 y Aldabó" [...] police headquarters in Havana awaiting trial. Some newspaper reports claimed he had already lost his licence {{as a consequence of}} various instances of careless driving. His mother in <b>Madrid</b> immediately <b>appealed</b> to the media in an open letter, stating her son's licence was still valid, and asking journalists to refrain from publishing speculative and incorrect information or from investigating confidential private data, and urging the media to use prudence, respect and responsibility. Various media reports mentioned a total of over 40 traffic fines since 2009, without stating that public documentation only existed for parking tickets which were of no relevance to the status of his driver's licence. His friends, according to various news media, described him as being [...] "the very figure of Prudence when {{behind the wheel of a}} car." [...] According to statements to media by his friend, head of Nuevas Generaciones for Madrid and MP Pablo Casado, after visiting Carromero in jail a few days after his return from Cuba, Carromero was considering asking for a formal investigation into who had leaked the information about his traffic fines including confidential data to the press. Casado underlined that of the 45 reported fines, 43 were parking tickets, and that Carromero had lost the credit points of his driving licence for a single incident of speeding in 2009 and a later incident of talking on his mobile phone. According to Casado, Carromero also wanted to know to what end the information was leaked and explained that it had had the effect of complicating his judicial process in Cuba after the Cuban authorities had become aware of the reports published in Spain and based their prosecution on his alleged record of reckless driving. The question of how and why various media, including reputable newspapers such as El País and El Mundo, had claimed various speeding offenses was not resolved.|$|R
