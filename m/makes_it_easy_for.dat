25|$|Ammonia is {{generally}} used in household cleaning products, {{as well as}} on farms and in some industrial and commercial locations, and this <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> accidental or deliberate exposure to occur. Ammonia interacts with moist surfaces to form ammonium hydroxide, which causes necrosis of tissues. Exposure to high concentrations can cause bronchiolar and alveolar edema and airway destruction resulting in respiratory distress or failure. Although ammonia has a pungent odor, it also causes olfactory fatigue or adaptation, reducing awareness of prolonged exposure.|$|E

It has good strength for pulling wire through tight places (“pull-through”), including conduits. It can be bent or twisted easily without breaking. It can be stripped and terminated during installation or service with far less danger of nicks or breaks. And it can be connected without the use of special lugs and fittings.
