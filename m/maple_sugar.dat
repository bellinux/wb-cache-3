5|$|Maple {{syrup and}} <b>maple</b> <b>sugar</b> were {{used during the}} American Civil War and by abolitionists {{in the years before}} the war because most cane sugar and {{molasses}} were produced by Southern slaves. Because of food rationing during the Second World War, people in the northeastern United States were encouraged to stretch their sugar rations by sweetening foods with maple syrup and <b>maple</b> <b>sugar,</b> and recipe books were printed to help housewives employ this alternative source.|$|E
5|$|Indigenous peoples {{living in}} northeastern North America {{were the first}} groups known to have {{produced}} maple syrup and <b>maple</b> <b>sugar.</b> According to aboriginal oral traditions, as well as archaeological evidence, maple tree sap was being processed into syrup long before Europeans arrived in the region. There are no authenticated accounts of how maple syrup production and consumption began, but various legends exist; {{one of the most}} popular involves maple sap being used in place of water to cook venison served to a chief. Other stories credit the development of maple syrup production to Nanabozho, Glooskap, or the squirrel. Aboriginal tribes developed rituals around sugar-making, celebrating the Sugar Moon (the first full moon of spring) with a Maple Dance. Many aboriginal dishes replaced the salt traditional in European cuisine with <b>maple</b> <b>sugar</b> or syrup.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{people of the}} Eastern U.S.A. domesticated numerous crops. Sunflowers, tobacco, varieties of squash and Chenopodium, as well as crops no longer grown, including marsh elder and little barley, were domesticated. Wild foods including wild rice and <b>maple</b> <b>sugar</b> were harvested. The most common varieties of strawberry were domesticated from Eastern North America. Two major crops, pecans and Concord grapes, were utilized extensively in prehistoric times but {{do not appear to}} have been domesticated until the 19th century.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the time}} of the American Civil War, syrup makers started using large, flat sheet metal pans as they were more {{efficient}} for boiling than heavy, rounded iron kettles, because of a greater surface area for evaporation. Around this time, cane sugar replaced <b>maple</b> <b>sugar</b> as the dominant sweetener in the US; as a result, producers focused marketing efforts on maple syrup. The first evaporator, used to heat and concentrate sap, was patented in 1858. In 1872, an evaporator was developed that featured two pans and a metal arch or firebox, which greatly decreased boiling time. Around 1900, producers bent the tin that formed the bottom of a pan into a series of flues, which increased the heated surface area of the pan and again decreased boiling time. Some producers also added a finishing pan, a separate batch evaporator, as a final stage in the evaporation process.|$|E

30|$|We {{conclude}} that forest structure (height) and resources (biomass) {{are more likely}} foundational characteristics supporting biodiversity rather than biodiversity determining forest productivity and/or biomass. The potential replacement of red <b>maple</b> for <b>sugar</b> <b>maple</b> in the New England areas could affect biodiversity and stability of forest ecosystem functioning because <b>sugar</b> <b>maple</b> plays important ecological roles distinct from red maple that are beneficial to other tree species in northern hardwood forests. Such a change may not affect forest resilience in terms of forest productivity and biomass as these are similar in red <b>maple</b> and <b>sugar</b> <b>maple,</b> however, it would almost certainly alter forest structure across the landscape.|$|R
25|$|While {{the refuge}} is {{protected}} {{primarily for the}} bird life, several rare or uncommon plant species have also {{been found in the}} grasslands, where Kentucky bluegrass is the dominant species Frank's sedge, small-flowered agrimony, purple milkweed, small white aster, Bush's sedge, coontail and watermeal. A few tree species, such as white ash, American elm, eastern red cedar, and pin oak, also flourish in those sections. The woodlands on the periphery are dominated by several oak species, red <b>maple,</b> <b>sugar</b> maple, shagbark hickory and tulip trees.|$|E
25|$|The {{inhabitants}} eventually organized {{themselves into}} small bands {{of a few}} families, grouped into larger tribes and chieftainships. The Innu are the inhabitants of an area they refer to as Nitassinan, i.e. most {{of what is now}} referred to as northeastern Quebec and Labrador. Their subsistence activities were historically centred on hunting and trapping caribou, deer and small game. Coastal clans also practised agriculture, fished and managed <b>maple</b> <b>sugar</b> bush. The Innu engaged in tribal warfare along the coast of Labrador with the Inuit groups that had significant populations.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s and 1940s, Nearing and Helen Knothe lived {{together}} in Winhall in rural Vermont, {{where they had}} purchased a rather large forest tract for $2200 and a moderate-sized farm for $2500. Nearing and Knothe lived a largely ascetic and self-reliant life, growing much of their own food and putting up nine stone buildings {{over the course of}} two decades. Cash was earned from producing maple syrup and <b>maple</b> <b>sugar</b> from the trees on their land and from Scott Nearing's occasional paid lectures. They married in 1947.|$|E
5000|$|It is also {{frequently}} {{confused with the}} more distantly related Acer saccharum (<b>sugar</b> <b>maple).</b> The <b>sugar</b> <b>maple</b> is easy to differentiate by clear sap in the petiole (Leaf stem; Norway maple has white sap). The tips of the points on Norway maple leaves reduce to a fine [...] "hair", while {{the tips of the}} points on <b>sugar</b> <b>maple</b> leaves are, on close inspection, rounded. On mature trees, <b>sugar</b> <b>maple</b> bark is more shaggy, while Norway maple bark has small, often criss-crossing grooves. While the shape and angle of leaf lobes vary somewhat within all maple species, the leaf lobes of Norway maple tend to have a more triangular shape, in contrast to the more squarish lobes often seen on <b>sugar</b> <b>maples.</b>|$|R
50|$|Moose Hill {{has many}} public programs. There is an outdoor summer day camp for {{children}} 3 - 14. Additionally, for adults, {{there are various}} clubs and programs.

25|$|There are {{thousands}} of species whose stems have economic uses. Stems provide a few major staple crops such as potato and taro. Sugarcane stems are {{a major source of}} sugar. <b>Maple</b> <b>sugar</b> is obtained from trunks of maple trees. Vegetables from stems are asparagus, bamboo shoots, cactus pads or nopalitos, kohlrabi, and water chestnut. The spice, cinnamon is bark from a tree trunk. Gum arabic is an important food additive obtained from the trunks of Acacia senegal trees. Chicle, the main ingredient in chewing gum, is obtained from trunks of the chicle tree.|$|E
25|$|Alvin Smith {{was born}} in 1798, the first {{surviving}} child of Joseph Smith Sr. and Lucy Mack Smith. During his youth, Smith worked as a carpenter’s helper to assist the Smith family in saving up sufficient funds to make {{a down payment on}} a farm in Manchester Township, south of Palmyra, New York. Smith also assisted his father in clearing timber, planting wheat and tapping maple trees for the purpose of making <b>maple</b> <b>sugar.</b> A neighbor, Orlando Saunders, stated that the members of the Smith family “have all worked for me many a day; they were very good people. Young Joe (as we called him then) has worked for me, and he was a good worker; they all were.” In the early 1820s, Smith was involved with his father and brothers in a number of treasure digging excavations in the Palmyra–Manchester area.|$|E
25|$|Joseph married Angelique McGulpin (Bead-Way-Way or Mecopemequa) in 1794 in Maketoquit's {{village at}} the foot of Maple River rapids, Michigan. Angelique was born about 1780 in Chig-au-mish-kene village on Grand River, Michigan. She was a {{daughter}} of Maketoquit (Black Cloud), the chief of a large band of Grand River Ottawa. He located his main village in what became Essex Township of Shiawassee County, {{on the south side of}} the Maple River, but the band used a winter camp in Lebanon Township of Clinton County (now the village of Maple Rapids) for gathering <b>maple</b> <b>sugar.</b> Children of the marriage were Francis Bailly, born in 1795; Alexis Bailly; born in 1798; and Sophia Bailly, born in 1807. The marriage ended in divorce. Francis remained with Maketoquit's band and Alexis was sent to boarding school in Montreal. Sophia was adopted by a close friend of both parents, fur trader Magdelaine Laframboise, who summered on Mackinac Island and wintered on Grand River (now Lowell, Michigan).|$|E
50|$|Maple syrup is {{made from}} reduced <b>sugar</b> <b>maple</b> sap. The sap often is {{harvested}} from the <b>Sugar</b> <b>Maple,</b> Acer saccharum.|$|R
30|$|Tree species {{diversity}} increases {{from the north}} to the south at a rate about 2 – 3 species per latitudinal degree. Tree {{species diversity}} is better predicted by tree height than forest age or biomass. Very different distribution patterns of two common <b>maple</b> species, <b>sugar</b> <b>maple</b> (Acer saccharum) and red maple (Acer rubrum), highlight the vulnerability of <b>sugar</b> <b>maple</b> and its potential replacement by red maple on New England landscapes. Red maple generally already outperforms <b>sugar</b> <b>maple,</b> and will likely and continuously benefit from a changing climate in New England.|$|R

500|$|The {{filtered}} syrup is graded and packaged {{while still}} hot, usually at {{a temperature of}} [...] or greater. The containers are turned over after being sealed to sterilize the cap with the hot syrup. Packages can be made of metal, glass, or coated plastic, depending on volume and target market. The syrup can also be heated longer and further processed to create {{a variety of other}} maple products, including <b>maple</b> <b>sugar,</b> maple butter or cream, and maple candy or taffy.|$|E
500|$|Other superficially similar species include L.rubrilacteus, L.rufus, L.subviscidus, L.fragilis and L.rufulus, {{but none}} of these species have the yellow {{staining}} reaction characteristic of L.vinaceorufescens. The edible species Lactarius helvus has an orange-brown to light grayish-brown cap with thin bands of dark grayish-brown, a watery latex, and whitish to tan flesh with an odor resembling <b>maple</b> <b>sugar</b> or burnt sugar. Lactarius theiogalus, the [...] "sulfur-milk Lactarius", has an oranger cap and white latex that slowly changes yellow upon exposure to air; it is typically found in broadleaf and mixed woods.|$|E
