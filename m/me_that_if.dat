500|$|In the 2011 {{video game}} , when the Joker's {{interview}} tapes are found, Joker retells his origin from The Killing Joke. In this version, he {{reveals that the}} two thugs worked for Carmine Falcone. At {{the end of the}} tapes, Joker apparently blames Batman for what happened to him. Hugo Strange then accuses him of having fabricated a series of events in order to conceal the truth about his condition, as he has read 12 different accounts of his past, all different, except for one detail: Batman. Joker then paraphrases a line from the book: [...] "What can I say? I like to keep things interesting.

500|$|O'Ree's {{breakthrough}} came {{several years}} after another black player, Herb Carnegie was denied the same opportunity. [...] In 1938–39, playing junior hockey with the Ontario Hockey Association's Toronto Rangers, during a practice Carnegie was pulled aside by his coach and told [...] "See that man sitting in the blues? [...] That's Conn Smythe, owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs. [...] He says he'd take you tomorrow if he could turn you white." [...] Stung by the comments, Carnegie resolved to excel at the game. He was offered a tryout with the Rangers in 1950, then a spot on their lowest minor league team. [...] "They told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I signed with the Rangers and went to New Haven, I would make international headlines. [...] I told them my family couldn't eat headlines.

500|$|Berry {{received}} $12.5million for {{the title}} role in the film Catwoman, a $100million movie; it grossed $17million on its first weekend. She was awarded a Worst Actress Razzie Award in 2005 for this role. She appeared at the ceremony to accept the award in person (making her the third person, and second actor, ever to do so) {{with a sense of}} humor, considering it an experience of the [...] "rock bottom" [...] in order to be [...] "at the top". Holding the Academy Award in one hand and the Razzie in the other she said, [...] "I never in my life thought that I would be here, winning a Razzie. It's not like I ever aspired to be here, but thank you. When I was a kid, my mother told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> you could not be a good loser, then there's no way you could be a good winner."

500|$|On May 3, Congressman George Smathers {{defeated}} liberal Senator Claude Pepper for the Democratic Senate {{nomination in}} Florida. Smathers' tactics included dubbing his opponent [...] "Red Pepper" [...] and distributing red-covered brochures, The Red Record of Senator Claude Pepper, {{that included a}} photograph of Pepper with Marcantonio. Soon after Smathers' triumph in the primary, which {{in the days of}} the yellow dog South was tantamount to election, South Dakota Republican Senator Karl Mundt, who when in the House had served with Nixon on HUAC, sent him a letter telling him about Smathers' brochure. Senator Mundt wrote to Nixon, [...] "It occurs to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Helen is your opponent in the fall, something of a similar nature might well be produced..." [...] Douglas wrote of Senator Pepper's defeat, [...] "The loss of Pepper is a great tragedy, and we are sick about it."

He took up Kyokushin karate at the age of 10, and began lifting weights as a teenager. Lundgren stated that [...] "My dad always told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I wanted to make something special with my life, I had to go to America."

[...] In the late 1970s, he enrolled at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and graduated with a degree in chemical engineering. The name [...] "Dolph" [...] comes from a distant relative of one of his first hamsters.|$|E
500|$|By {{this time}} some early {{supporters}} of Joyce's work, such as Ezra Pound and the author's brother Stanislaus Joyce, had grown increasingly unsympathetic {{to his new}} writing. In {{order to create a}} more favourable critical climate, a group of Joyce's supporters (including Samuel Beckett, William Carlos Williams, Rebecca West and others) put together a collection of critical essays on the new work. It was published in 1929 under the title Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress. In July 1929, increasingly demoralised by the poor reception his new work was receiving, Joyce approached his friend James Stephens about the possibility of his completing the book. Joyce wrote to Weaver in late 1929 that he had [...] "explained to [...] all about the book, at least a great deal, and he promised <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> I found it madness to continue, in my condition, and saw no other way out, that he would devote himself heart and soul to the completion of it, that is the second part and the epilogue or fourth." [...] Apparently Joyce chose Stephens on superstitious grounds, as he had been born in the same hospital as Joyce, exactly one week later, and shared both the first names of Joyce himself and his fictional alter-ego Stephen Dedalus. In the end, Stephens was not asked to finish the book.|$|E

500|$|Author Amish Tripathi is {{a finance}} {{professional}} educated from Indian Institute of Management Calcutta (IIM-C). While {{working in the}} insurance industry, Tripathi felt that his life was devoid of any meaning or self. Ultimately {{he decided to take}} the spiritual route. He started reading on the different philosophies and the Indian mythologies. One day, while watching a historical program, Tripathi and his family got into the discussion about consciousness and the evil inside man. In the program they learned that in ancient Persia, demons were known as Daeva (a term reserved for the Gods in Indian mythology), and angels were called Asuras (a term reserved for demons in Indian mythology). Tripathi added, [...] "It set me thinking that this was exact opposite of our Vedic etymology where evil was Asura and gods were Devas. It struck <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the two civilizations were to confront each other, they would be at stark odds and calling each other evil." [...] But when he decided {{to write a book about}} the philosophy of evil, his family discouraged him, saying that the subject itself was not popular and would get a narrow audience. They suggested that Tripathi write a thriller/adventure novel and the philosophy should be a part of the story, hence there would be a mainstream appeal in it. Tripathi felt that no subject was better than Shiva, one of the major Hindu deity and the destroyer of evil; his journey and stories about him would deliver the philosophy that he wanted to convey, to his readers. Once he started to write a book about Shiva, he decided to base it on some fundamental beliefs of his. He noted that the Hindu Gods were probably not [...] "mythical beings or a figment of a rich imagination", but rather they were once human beings like the rest. It was their deeds in the human life that made them famous as Gods.|$|E
500|$|After Gilbert's retirement, {{and even}} {{following}} his death, controversy remained {{attached to his}} name; {{there seemed to be}} a conspiracy of silence surrounding his fate. Cricket historians rarely mentioned him, despite his varied career. W. G. Grace, although including Gilbert in an appendix of leading batsmen in his 1891 book Cricket, did not include him in the text at all, despite the book's more than 400pages; in his Cricketers I Have Met, Grace described 121cricketers but did not mention his cousin. Further evidence of Gilbert's disgrace came in the pages of Wisden. Although Gilbert began as an amateur cricketer, which entitled him to have [...] "Mr." [...] before his name in the [...] "Births and Deaths" [...] section, he was referred to until his death as [...] "Gilbert, W. R.", which denoted a professional. However, in his Wisden obituary he received the title [...] "Mr. W. R. Gilbert", even though the [...] "Births and Deaths" [...] still listed him as a professional, and in 1935 he was once again restored to amateur status in [...] "Births and Deaths", for reasons which are unclear. The same obituary glossed over Gilbert's enforced retirement from cricket, simply observing: [...] "At the beginning of 1886 he became a professional, and the season was not far advanced before his career in first-class cricket ended abruptly. He then left England for Canada." [...] Even in 1970, the silence continued; historian Rowland Bowen wrote about the story but concluded by saying: [...] "Another indication of the recurring instinct for suppression was a suggestion to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> this story had not appeared in print before (it has not) it should not now." [...] It is not clear who made this suggestion, whether it was descendants of the Grace family, a cricket administrator or someone else. It was not until 1984 that the full story was published by historian Robert Brook. In reviewing what he considered to be the injustice of the case, and reflecting on Gilbert's success in Canada, Green wrote: [...] "No wonder that those responsible for this act of appalling cruelty went to such fatuous lengths to keep its details a secret." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dismayed to {{find that}} {{groundbreaking}} work had already been undertaken by Helmholtz who had conveyed vowel sounds {{by means of a}} similar tuning fork [...] "contraption", Bell pored over the German scientist's book.
