40|$|This article lists {{a number}} of {{geological}} data on the conditions of formation of some major gold deposits in the conglomerates of the Earth's crust. We analyze the metallogenic, tectonic, stratigraphic and other factors controlling the formation of gold-bearing conglomerates in certain fields, such as the Witwatersrand (S. Africa) and Darwaz (Tajikistan). The following tectonic factors play the leading role in controlling the formation of deposits of gold-bearing conglomerates in the Earth's crust:  Epochs of mountain building of different ages in folded belts;  Epochs of mountain building in activation of consolidated gold ore provinces in the domed uplifts of ancient shields, median areas and in areas with complete folding;  The role of lithogenesis of the molasse cycle, transgressions and angular unconformity {{in the formation of}} gold-bearing conglomerates in a large area;  Synchroneity with mountain building in gold ore provinces of different, intermountain <b>molasse</b> and marginal <b>basins</b> of various ages; and imposed volcanic and terrigenic conglomeratic <b>molasse</b> <b>basins</b> in activated gold ore provinces  Volcanic belts and deep faults. There are three industrial types of gold-bearing conglomerates: ancient Precambrian (indurated) sedimentary-metamorphosed placer, Phanerozoic cemented placer, and younger, weak, friable Pliocene-Pleistocene placers. We give some details about the methods for their exploration and financial costs for the development of selected industrial types of gold-bearing conglomerates. In this article, it is noted that during the Sassanian and the Mongolian Empire a certain amount of native gold was extracted from the Late Alpine molasse conglomerates which formed during the activation of gold ore area of the major Iranian middle massif. By analogy with the geological conditions of formation of deposits of gold-bearing conglomerates in the Earth's crust, the geological search criteria for deposits of gold-bearing conglomerates in some orogenic and widespread activated imposed conglomeratic <b>molasse</b> <b>basins</b> of Iran are given.

40|$|AbstractThe {{important}} event in Jurassic tectonics in Mongolia was the subduction and {{closure of the}} Mongolia-Okhotsk ocean; correspondingly, basin evolution {{can be divided into}} two main stages, related to the orogeny and collapse of the orogenic belt, respectively. The developing of Early–Middle Jurassic basins {{to the north of the}} ocean resulted from back-arc extension. The fossil sutures, from the China–SE Asia sub-continent to the south of the ocean, were rejuvenated by subduction-related orogeny; in addition, the Yanshanian intra-continental movement occurred. Three Early–Middle Jurassic <b>molasse</b> <b>basins</b> were developed by movement in Inner Mongolia, all of which stretched westwards (or northwards) into Mongolia; therefore, the <b>molasse</b> <b>basins</b> in eastern and southern Mongolia had the same geometric and kinematic features as the basins in the Inner Mongolia. Owing to the collapse of the Mongolia-Okhotsk orogenic belt, a group of rift basins developed during the Late Jurassic. In eastern Mongolia, the NE orientated extensional basins were controlled by the neogenic NE-structure. The contemporary basins in southern Mongolia and the neighboring areas in China were constrained by remobilization (inherited activation) of the latitudinal or ENE-directional basement structures. Three stages can be recognized in the evolution of the Early–Middle Jurassic basins after reversal; the basins also experienced four episodes of reformation...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The Ribeira and Dom Feliciano {{collision}} belts are constituted of many overthrust bounded entities, some of {{them with}} very different stratigraphic record. They were intensively modified by large transcurrent faults. Two supercycles, one Mesoproterozoic and the other Neoproterozoic, has been recognized {{in the evolution of}} the belts, mainly based on the study of the meta-sedimentary complexes. The Mesoproterozoic records a segmented sedimentary basin supercycle and metamorphism; in early Neoproterozoic the convergence zone was stretched and collapsed and the basins evolved through a complete sedimentary supercycle. Inversion is indicated by collisional granites from 750 Ma, culminating with strong deformation, closure of basins, metamorphism and allochthons formation in mainly frontal collision around 650 Ma. Flexural marine <b>molasse</b> <b>basins</b> were formed during Vendian. New inversion was produced by strong convergence and lateral movement of blocks, subcontinental mantle and crustal fusion, late tectonic migmatite and granite intrusions (600 - 560 Ma). Later on (540 - 490), alkaline granite intrusion affected many environments, felsic volcanism and continental sedimentary rocks accumulated in many extensional zones and graben-like basins. Syngenetic massive sulfide polymetallic exhalative mineralization is common in the Mesoproterozoic supercycle terranes, while in the Neoproterozoic the common mineralization are epigenetic Pb-Zn massive sulfides in limestones and Cu-Zn-Pb in terrigenous sediments...|$|R

Remnants of rnicrofossils in dolornite clasts of the conglomerates {{indicate an}} Early Paleozoic {{age of the}} Macnairrabbane unit. The Glenbegdalen, Taylorfjellet and Macnairrabbane units were affected by two ductile phases of isoclinal folding (Dl, D 2), followed by a third ductile to brittle stage (D 3) of NE-vergen! folding. This polyphase deforrnation post-dated the deposition of the Early Paleozoic Macnairrabbane unit, indicating a Caledonian age of Dl to D 3. The Sutorfjella conglomerate on the west-coast of Prins Karls Forland contains clasts which are characterized by two stages of ductile folding and foliation (Dl, D 2), whereas the matrix is unaffected by an y ductile deforrnation. The Sutorfjella conglomerate unconforrnably overlies the vertical short limb of a F 3 -fold.

This first large scale electromagnetic study in the Alps covers a cross-section from Germany to northern Italy and shows the importance of the alpine mountain chain as an interrupter of continuous conductors. Poor data quality due to the highly crystalline underground is overcome by Remote Reference and Robust Processing techniques. 3 d-forward-modelling reveals on the one hand interrupted dipping crustal conductors with maximum conductance of 4960 S {{and on the other hand}} a lithosphere thickening up to 208 km beneath the central western Alps. Graphite networks arising from Paleozoic sedimentary deposits are considered to be accountable for the occurrence of high conductivity and the distribution pattern of crustal conductors. The influence of huge sedimentary <b>molasse</b> <b>basins</b> on the electromagnetic data is suggested to be minor compared with the influence of crustal conductors. In conclusion, electromagnetic results can be attributed to the geological, tectonic and palaeogeographical background.

These cross sections were built using published data for the Jura and subalpine fold-and-thrust belts and new structural and field analysis for the External Crystalline Massifs. Five units are defined: the sedimentary nappes from innermost parts of the external zone (e. g., ultra-Dauphinois/Helvetic), the crystalline units with their dysharmonically folded cover (e. g., Morcles nappe), sedimentary nappes over the frontal parts of the crystalline massifs (the Aravis-Granier unit), the subalpine belts (e. g., Vercors, Chartreuse, Bauges, and Bornes), and the Jura. Except for the ultra-Dauphinois nappes, the shortening, including the cover shortening, always corresponds to basement shortening.

40|$|International audienceThe Oligocene {{evolution}} of the southern branch of the western Alpine arc, more precisely the stack of metamorphic Briançonnais and Piedmont nappes composing the southern Penninic arc (SPA), {{are the focus of}} this study. We review published structural, sedimentological and thermochronological data in order to discuss exhumation of the SPA. At first, we compare bedrock zircon and apatite fission-track (FT) data from the SPA with detrital thermochronologic data (zircon FT, white mica 40 Ar/ 39 Ar) from Oligocene molasse deposits. Using improved stratigraphic ages for the Barrême basin, samples from the uppermost Rupelian "Conglomérat de Clumanc" and the Chattian "Molasse Rouge" provided zircon FT lag times of ~ 3. 5 and 8 m. y., indicating source exhumation rates on the order of ~ 1. 5 and ~ 0. 75 km/m. y. respectively. These short lag times are consistent with lag times of 40 Ar- 39 Ar ages of detrital white mica from the same formations in the same basin, and also from Oligocene molasse sediments in the Tertiary Piedmont basin. The sediment source for these grains as for the associated clasts of blueschist, is identified as the HP-LT metamorphic units of the SPA. The source cannot be the Ubaye-Embrunais nappes as classically considered, because these nappes do not bear the required metamorphic imprint. This interpretation is consistent with fast Oligocene cooling of the SPA, as attested by in situ zircon and apatite FT analyses. Such fast and relatively old cooling is a peculiarity of the southern branch of the western Alpine arc, when considering the entire arc. A second range of data concerns the structural building of the SPA. The initial stacking of metamorphic nappes in a poorly elevated accretionnary wedge was completed {{before the end of the}} Eocene. During the Early Oligocene collision, this wedge was severely refolded, acquiring its fan structure, as visible in cross section, and its curvature in map view. In such a context, we propose that fast exhumation and cooling of the SPA during the Oligocene resulted from active erosion of rapidly raised high topography. This is consistent with the sudden arrival of metamorphic Penninic clasts in the <b>molasse</b> <b>basins</b> along both flanks of the belt. Moreover, detrital and in situ thermochronological ages, suggest a strong slowing down of cooling and exhumation from the Miocene onwards, coinciding with brittle extension that dominates in the SPA during this long period. The brief Early Oligocene rise of a SPA cordillera, contrasts with the preceding and subsequent period of poor relief of the SPA. The mountainous character of the SPA today is not directly inherited from the Oligocene orogenic climax, as modern high relief and elevation are most likely related to rejuvenation under climatic control during the Quaternary...|$|R

These uncertainties resulted in at least two widely different stratigraphic frameworks for the Bavarian and Swiss Molasse which results in ages that are about 1 Myr apart. This difference is mainly related to the assumption that a major hiatus is present in southern Germany, similar to the Styrian unconformity in Austria. The different opinions have led to different correlations of the Upper Molasse to either the Ottnangian or the Karpatian. The definitions, of these regional stages, are very strongly interconnected to each other, which will result in a review of the exact age of the Ottnangian – Karpatian boundary. To resolve this risen controversy a joint effort was undertaken. With new biostratigraphic, paleomagnetic and radiometric data from several key sections in Switzerland and from boreholes taken throughout Bavaria (Southern Germany) combined with data from the last decades resulted in the conclusion that the Ottnangian-Karpatian boundary has an age of 16. 3 Ma (+/- 0. 1 Myr).

An {{assessment of}} historical gold {{production of the}} Gold Quadri-lateral (GQ) yielded a total estimate of 55. 7 Moz of gold throughout an area of 2400 km 2. Interpreted in terms of mineralization density this is 23, 208 oz of gold/ km 2. The geological setting of the GQ is represented mainly by Tertiary (14. 7 My to 7. 4 My) calc-alkaline volcano-plutonic complexes of intermediate character in sedimentary <b>basins</b> of <b>molasse</b> type. These <b>basins</b> are tectonically controlled by NW-SE lineation across early Alpine magmatic products, i. e. subduction related Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous igneous association (island arc ophiolites and granitoids) and Upper Cretaceous igneous association (banatites). The Tertiary magmatism is associated with extensional tectonics caused by NE escape of the Pannonian region during Upper Oligocene-Lower Miocene times. As a result of tectono-magmatic and mineralization-alteration characteristics, two metallogenetical types were separated in the GQ, i. e. calc-alkaline andesitic (CAM) and sub-alkaline rhyodacitic (SRM). Both develop almost entirely low-sulfidation type of Au epithermal mineralization. However, two subtypes, -rich in sulfide (2 - 7 %) and -poor in sulfide (7 - 20 %) were delineated and correlated with CAM type and SRM type respectively. Furthermore, CAM is connected at deeper levels with Cu-Au+/-Mo porphyry systems in contrast with SRM, which is a non-porphyry environment. The Brad-Săcărâmb district contains mainly CAM type andesitic structures. It is a porphyry environment with epithermal low-sulfidation-rich sulfide vein halo (Barza, Troiţa-Bolcana deposits). However, a few SRM type patterns, such as Măgura Ţebii, Băiţa-Crăciuneşti and Săcărâmb, deposits exhibit Au-Ag-Te low-sulfidation-poor sulfide epithermal vein halo. The Zlatna-Stănija district exhibits similar characteristics, with Au-Ag+/-Pb, Zn veins in Cu-Au subvolcanic-porphyry environment (CAM type). An exception is the Faţa Băii Au-Ag-Te vein system that corresponds to SRM type. Rosia Montana-Bucium district is more elaborated {{in terms of a}} porphyry-epithermal relationship. Both CAM type (Roşia Poieni, Bucium Tarniţa deposits) and SRM type (Roşia Montană deposit) exist. The Baia de Arieş district is definitely the non-porphyry environment of SRM type, with Au-Ag-Te veins and breccia pipes hosted in sub-alkaline andesitic rocks...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Molasse</b> <b>basin</b> {{stretches}} over {{a length}} of 1000 kilometers along the long axis of the Alps, in France, Switzerland, Germany and Austria. The western end is at Lake Geneva, where the basins outcrop is just 20 km wide. Further to the northeast the basin becomes wider. It forms the subsurface of the Swiss Mittelland and reaches its largest width (circa 130 km) in the Bavarian foreland of the Alps. From Amstetten to Sankt Pölten the basin forms a narrow band, just 10 km in width. After that it widens again to the east. North of the Danube River it connects with the Vienna basin, and is thus connected with the Pannonian Basin further east.|$|E
