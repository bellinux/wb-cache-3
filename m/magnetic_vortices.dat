2500|$|In a {{class of}} superconductors known as type II superconductors, {{including}} all known high-temperature superconductors, an extremely low but nonzero resistivity appears at temperatures not too far below the nominal superconducting transition when an electric current is applied {{in conjunction with a}} strong magnetic field, which may be caused by the electric current. This is due to the motion of <b>magnetic</b> <b>vortices</b> in the electronic superfluid, which dissipates some of the energy carried by the current. If the current is sufficiently small, the vortices are stationary, and the resistivity vanishes. The resistance due to this effect is tiny compared with that of non-superconducting materials, but {{must be taken into account}} in sensitive experiments. However, as the temperature decreases far enough below the nominal superconducting transition, these vortices can become frozen into a disordered but stationary phase known as a [...] "vortex glass". Below this vortex glass transition temperature, the resistance of the material becomes truly zero.|$|E

50|$|The Aharonov-Casher {{effect is}} a quantum {{mechanical}} phenomenon predicted in 1984 in which a traveling magnetic dipole is affected by an electric field. It is dual to the Aharonov-Bohm effect, in which the quantum phase of a charged particle depends upon which side of a magnetic flux tube it comes through. In the Aharonov-Casher effect, the particle has a magnetic moment and the tubes are charged instead. It was observed in a gravitational neutron inferometer in 1989(Cimmino et al.) and later by fluxon interference of <b>magnetic</b> <b>vortices</b> in Josephson junctions (Elion et al.).

50|$|Pinning {{force is}} a force acting on a pinned object from a pinning center. In solid state physics, this most often refers to the vortex pinning, the pinning of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>vortices</b> (magnetic flux quanta, Abrikosov vortices) by {{different}} kinds of the defects in a type II superconductor. Important quantities are the individual maximal pinning force, which defines the depinning of a single vortex, and an average pinning force, which defines the depinning of the correlated vortex structures and {{can be associated with}} the critical current density (the maximal density of non-dissipative current). The interaction of the correlated vortex lattice with system of pinning centers forms the magnetic phase diagram of the vortex matter in superconductors. This phase diagram is especially rich for high temperature superconductors (HTSC) where the thermo-activation processes are essential.|$|E

In the first part we show how the phase shifts for an electron scattering on an isolated vortex, can be calculated analytically, and related to the transport properties through a force balance equation. In the second part we present numerical results for the Hall conductivity of the 2 DEG in a periodic array of flux vortices. We find characteristic peaks in the Hall conductance, when plotted against the filling fraction. It is argued that the peaks can be interpreted in terms of ``topological charge'' piling up across local and global gaps in the energy spectrum.

For <b>magnetic</b> <b>vortices</b> to be practical, an effective reconfigurability of the two topologies of <b>magnetic</b> <b>vortices,</b> that is, the circularity and the polarity, is an essential prerequisite.

Abstract—We propose {{a method for}} the vortex extraction and tracking of superconducting <b>magnetic</b> flux <b>vortices</b> for both structured and unstructured mesh data. In the Ginzburg-Landau theory, <b>magnetic</b> flux <b>vortices</b> are well-defined features in a complex-valued order parameter field, and their dynamics determine electromagnetic properties in type-II superconductors. Our method represents each vortex line (a 1 D curve embedded in 3 D space) as a connected graph extracted from the discretized field in both space and time. For a time-varying discrete dataset, our vortex extraction and tracking method is as accurate as the data discretization. We then apply 3 D visualization and 2 D event diagrams to the extraction and tracking results to help scientists understand vortex dynamics and macroscale superconductor behavior in greater detail than previously possible.

In our work we study properties of the vortices at finite temperature using lattice simulations of SU(2) gauge theory. We show that <b>magnetic</b> <b>vortices</b> provide a numerically large contribution to thermodynamic quantities of the gluon plasma in Yang-Mills theory. In particular, we observe that in the deconfinement phase at temperatures T_c < T < 3 T_c the magnetic component of the gluon plasma produces a negative (ghostlike) contribution to the anomaly of the energy-momentum tensor. In the confinement phase the vortex contribution is positive. The thermodynamical significance of the magnetic objects allows us to suggest that the quark-gluon plasma may contain a developed network of magnetic flux tubes. The existence of the vortex network may lead to observable effects in the quark-gluon plasma because the chromomagnetic field of the vortices should scatter and drag quarks.
