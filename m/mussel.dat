5|$|Some {{freshwater}} bivalves have very restricted ranges. For example, the Ouachita creekshell <b>mussel,</b> Villosa arkansasensis, is known {{only from the}} streams of the Ouachita Mountains in Arkansas and Oklahoma, and like several other freshwater <b>mussel</b> species from the southeastern US, it {{is in danger of}} extinction. In contrast, a few species of {{freshwater bivalves}}, including the golden <b>mussel</b> (Limnoperna fortunei), are dramatically increasing their ranges. The golden <b>mussel</b> has spread from Southeast Asia to Argentina, where it has become an invasive species. Another well-travelled freshwater bivalve, the zebra <b>mussel</b> (Dreissena polymorpha) originated in southeastern Russia, and has been accidentally introduced to inland waterways in North America and Europe, where the species damages water installations and disrupts local ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{nationwide}} attention the incident received, the <b>Mussel</b> Slough Tragedy is not remembered much today {{as well as}} later gunfights such as the gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Richard Maxwell Brown argues in No Duty to Retreat that the <b>Mussel</b> Slough shootout did not fit the mold of the gunfight/hero myth, which usually ignores such factors as ideology, and social and economic conflict, thus not implanting it in the lore of the American Old West.|$|E
40|$|We studied prey {{choice of}} a captive Oystercatcher:hat {{hammered}} <b>Mussels</b> from the ventral side. The results replicate previous findings that ventral hammerers select <b>Mussels</b> of intermediate size, select against thick-shelled <b>Mussels,</b> abandon an increasing proportion of <b>Mussels</b> with increasing size and do nor pick up <b>Mussels</b> covered with barnacles. Abandoned <b>Mussels</b> had thicker shells than <b>Mussels</b> that were successfully opened, {{but part of the}} selection against thick shells seemed to occur before the <b>Mussels</b> were picked up. Barnacles could not serve as cue for this. In fact, it remains unclear why ventrally hammering Oystercatchers ignore <b>Mussels</b> covered with barnacles...|$|R
40|$|General EcologyThe {{possible}} commensal {{relationship between}} benthic algae and zebra <b>mussels</b> occupying the same rocky substrate was studied at Douglas Lake in Pellston, Michigan. Chlorophyll a tests {{were used to}} analyze benthic algae concentrations on three different treatments: rocks with live zebra <b>mussels,</b> rocks with dead zebra <b>mussels,</b> and rocks with no zebra <b>mussels</b> with expectations to find that rocks with zebra <b>mussels</b> have higher benthic algae concentrations than rocks with no zebra <b>mussels,</b> and rocks with live zebra <b>mussels</b> have higher benthic algae density than rocks with dead zebra <b>mussels.</b> The study was divided into field survey, field study and laboratory study. In the field survey, I observed a trend that showed higher benthic algae concentration on rocks with zebra mussels; however, it was statistically insignificant. I compared the chlorophyll a concentration found on rocks with live and dead zebra <b>mussels</b> with rocks without zebra <b>mussels</b> for the field and laboratory studies, and found {{a significant difference in}} the field study, which showed that rocks with zebra <b>mussels</b> had higher benthic algae concentration. Finally, I compared rocks with live zebra <b>mussels</b> and dead zebra <b>mussels</b> and found an insignificant difference between the two treatments for the field and laboratory study, even though the trends showed a higher concentration of benthic algae on rocks with dead zebra <b>mussels.</b> Since rocks with zebra <b>mussels</b> showed a higher concentration of benthic algae in general, a commensal relationship between the two organisms is possible...|$|R
40|$|Gut {{analysis}} of a recent Great Lakes invader, the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) collected from the Cheboygan River, showed that they ate zebra and or quagga <b>mussels</b> (Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena bugensis) 68 % of the time. This study investigated the preference of round gobies to select for different size classes of <b>mussels.</b> There was a significant positive relationship found between the length of round gobies {{and the size of}} <b>mussels</b> selected. Although the larger round gobies sampled in this study were able to consume larger <b>mussels,</b> smaller <b>mussels</b> were still preferred. This study suggests that the preference of smaller <b>mussels</b> by round gobies will not alter the population of <b>mussels</b> due to nonselection of the largest <b>mussels</b> as prey and the benthic nature of the round goby...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to promoting growth of kelp forests, sea otters {{can also have}} a profound effect in rocky areas that tend to be dominated by <b>mussel</b> beds. They remove mussels from rocks, liberating space for competitive species and thereby increasing the diversity of species in the area.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the species}} in the {{freshwater}} <b>mussel</b> family, Unionidae, commonly known as pocketbook mussels, have evolved an unusual reproductive strategy. The female's mantle protrudes from the shell and develops into an imitation small fish, complete with fish-like markings and false eyes. This decoy moves in the current and attracts the attention of real fish. Some fish see the decoy as prey, while others see a conspecific. They approach {{for a closer look}} and the <b>mussel</b> releases huge numbers of larvae from its gills, dousing the inquisitive fish with its tiny, parasitic young. These glochidia larvae are drawn into the fish's gills, where they attach and trigger a tissue response that forms a small cyst around each larva. The larvae then feed by breaking down and digesting the tissue of the fish within the cysts. After a few weeks they release themselves from the cysts and fall to the stream bed as juvenile molluscs. The fish are relatively unharmed.|$|E
5|$|The {{watershed}} of Darby Creek {{and several}} other nearby creeks house most of the herptiles in Delaware County. The macroinvertebrate communities of the creek mainly consist of Limestone Agricultural Stream communities. No <b>mussel</b> communities have been described on the creek. In the 2000s, the dry weight of periphyton in the creek was 248.2 grams per square meter.|$|E

5|$|A {{study of}} nine {{different}} bivalves with widespread distributions in tropical marine waters {{concluded that the}} <b>mussel,</b> Trichomya hirsuta, most nearly reflected in its tissues the level of heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Cu, Zn, Co, Ni, and Ag) in its environment. In this species there was a linear relationship between the sedimentary levels and the tissue concentration of all the metals except zinc. In the Persian Gulf, the Atlantic pearl-oyster (Pinctada radiata) {{is considered to be}} a useful bioindicator of heavy metals.|$|E
5|$|Dyspanopeus sayi lives {{predominantly}} on muddy bottoms, {{where it}} is a predator of bivalve molluscs. In its native environment, it hides among colonies of polychaetes to avoid being preyed on by the Atlantic blue crab, Callinectes sapidus. It is an important predator of the quahog, Mercenaria mercenaria, in Narragansett Bay, and of the barnacle Balanus improvisus in Delaware Bay. In the Adriatic Sea, {{it has been observed}} to feed on the striped venus clam, Chamelea gallina, and the introduced Asian date <b>mussel,</b> Musculista senhousia.|$|E
40|$|Student PaperZebra <b>mussels</b> (Dreissena polymorpha) are an {{invasive}} species in Douglas Lake that have disrupted the aquatic community, such as decreasing {{the abundance of}} food for native bivalves. They have major consequences on the population of native <b>mussels</b> and fish species, such as decreased abundance and possibly extinction. To understand how to control the increasing population of zebra <b>mussels,</b> the preference of substrate for colonization and the recolonization rate of the species must be determined. To determine this rate we measured, marked, and removed zebra <b>mussels</b> off of live and dead native <b>mussels.</b> In addition, we introduced clean rocks to observe the colonization rate of zebra <b>mussels</b> on them. We then recollected the substrates and determined recolonization. Our results showed that zebra <b>mussels</b> have no preference for the substrate that they recolonize. The average recolonization rate of each substrate was 0. 08 <b>mussels</b> per day. From our observations, we suggest a protocol for controling the population of zebra <b>mussels</b> and the impacts that they cause on the aquatic community. The protocol may help us create a refuge for native <b>mussels</b> to sustain the population in Douglas Lake...|$|R

5|$|In 1908, Erie started {{building}} a waterworks on Presque Isle to provide fresh {{water for the}} city. Water from Lake Erie was pumped into two reservoirs on the peninsula, where particulates in the water were allowed to settle, removing them from the lake water. After treatment, the water flowed into the waterlines of the city. In 1917 a pumphouse powered by a steam boiler and engine was built: this pumped the water from one basin into the other, then across Presque Isle Bay to Erie. This system of supplying drinking water for Erie operated until 1949. The pumphouse is now used for zebra <b>mussel</b> control and as a concession stand for bicycle and quadracycle-rentals within the state park.|$|E
5|$|Mountain hare (apparently {{absent from}} Skye in the 18th century) and rabbit are now {{abundant}} and predated on by wild cat and pine marten. Red deer are common {{on the hills}} and the grey seal and common seal are present around the coasts of Scotland in internationally important numbers, with colonies of the former found on Oronsay and the Treshnish Isles and the latter most abundant in the Firth of Lorn. The rich fresh water streams contain brown trout, Atlantic salmon and water shrew. Offshore minke whales, killer whales, basking sharks, porpoises and dolphins are among the sea life {{that can be seen}} and edible crab and oyster are also found, in for example, the Sound of Scalpay. There are nationally important horse <b>mussel</b> and brittlestar beds in the sea lochs.|$|E
5|$|The smooth toadfish {{has strong}} jaws that readily crush {{shellfish}} and crustaceans. It feeds predominantly on benthic (bottom-dwelling) organisms in the substrate {{of the bodies}} of water in which it forages. Its diet includes molluscs such as black mussels, pipis, white sunset shells (Soletellina alba) and oysters (Crassostrea), crustaceans such as semaphore crabs and shrimp, and brown algae. The proportions of crustaceans to molluscs can vary widely depending on the abundance of food items; hence in a 1999 field study, the soldier crab (Mictyris longicarpus) predominated in Cowan Creek while the black <b>mussel</b> did so in nearby Berowra Creek. Field experiments showed it was a consumer of oysters and the gastropod Bembicium auratum, and had {{a major impact on}} their numbers.|$|E

5|$|Under each foreleg, the {{sea otter}} has a loose pouch of skin that extends across the chest. In this pouch (preferentially the left one), the animal stores {{collected}} food {{to bring to}} the surface. This pouch also holds a rock, unique to the otter, that is used to break open shellfish and clams. There, the sea otter eats while floating on its back, using its forepaws to tear food apart and bring it to its mouth. It can chew and swallow small mussels with their shells, whereas large <b>mussel</b> shells may be twisted apart. It uses its lower incisor teeth to access the meat in shellfish.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{inhabit the}} tropics, {{as well as}} {{temperate}} and boreal waters. A number of species can survive and even flourish in extreme conditions. They are abundant in the Arctic, about 140 species being known from that zone. The Antarctic scallop, Adamussium colbecki, lives under the sea ice {{at the other end}} of the globe, where the subzero temperatures mean that growth rates are very slow. The giant <b>mussel,</b> Bathymodiolus thermophilus, and the giant white clam, Calyptogena magnifica, both live clustered around hydrothermal vents at abyssal depths in the Pacific Ocean. They have chemosymbiotic bacteria in their gills that oxidise hydrogen sulphide, and the molluscs absorb nutrients synthesized by these bacteria. The saddle oyster, Enigmonia aenigmatica, is a marine species that could be considered amphibious. It lives above the high tide mark in the tropical Indo-Pacific on the underside of mangrove leaves, on mangrove branches, and on sea walls in the splash zone.|$|E
5|$|Most of the bivalve larvae that hatch from eggs in {{the water}} column feed on diatoms or other phytoplankton. In {{temperate}} regions, about 25% of species are lecithotrophic, depending on nutrients stored in the yolk of the egg where the main energy source is lipids. The longer the period is before the larva first feeds, the larger the egg and yolk need to be. The reproductive cost of producing these energy-rich eggs is high and they are usually smaller in number. For example, the Baltic tellin (Macoma balthica) produces few, high-energy eggs. The larvae hatching out of these rely on the energy reserves and do not feed. After about four days, they become D-stage larvae, when they first develop hinged, D-shaped valves. These larvae have a relatively small dispersal potential before settling out. The common <b>mussel</b> (Mytilus edulis) produces 10 times as many eggs that hatch into larvae and soon need to feed to survive and grow. They can disperse more widely as they remain planktonic for a much longer time.|$|E
