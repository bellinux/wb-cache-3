40|$|In the {{sociology}} of literature over the ages, patronage is undoubtedly {{one of the most}} pervasive themes. ! The late 1 st century AD presents no exception. Though the early Empire lacked a patron having the renown of Maecenas (d. 8 BC), it is nonetheless eminently worthy of study in this regard in view of two contemporary writers- Martial (AD 40 - c. 103) and Statius (c. 45 - c. 96). Despite manifest differences in style and temperament between these poets, both can be described as occasional poets (i. e. poets composing for specific social occasions) and this fact alone renders patronage highly apposite. Concentrating therefore on that period, I wish here to examine the phenomenon of literary patronage within the context of Roman <b>mores.</b> <b>Broadly</b> speaking, patronage of letters must be situated in the characteristically Roman system of patron-client relations. Topics to be discussed include its terminology and mechanics, origins, its purpose and value- material or otherwise- and the poet's economic position in society, and finally its continuity over Roman history. This study is undertaken {{in the form of a}} survey of some of the more important critical literature on the subject to have appeared in recent times, but i hope i...|$|R

He also encouraged the remaining Mau Mau fighters to leave the forests and settle in society. However, throughout Kenyatta's rule, many of these individuals would remain unemployed, with unemployment being one of the most persistent problems facing his government.|$|E
5|$|Equus is a genus {{of mammals}} {{in the family}} Equidae, which {{includes}} horses, asses, and zebras. Within Equidae, Equus is the only recognized extant genus, comprising seven living species. The term equine refers to any member of this genus, including horses. Like Equidae <b>more</b> <b>broadly,</b> Equus has numerous extinct species known only from fossils. The genus most likely originated in North America and spread quickly to the Old World. Equines are odd-toed ungulates with slender legs, long heads, relatively long necks, manes (erect in most subspecies) and long tails. All species are herbivorous, and mostly grazers with simpler digestive systems than ruminants but able to subsist on lower quality vegetation.|$|E
5|$|In 1891, Joel Asaph Allen was {{the first}} to scientifically {{describe}} Transandinomys talamancae, when he named Oryzomys talamancae from a specimen from Talamanca, Costa Rica.

Oldfield Thomas added O.sylvaticus from Santa Rosa, Ecuador in 1900 and O.panamensis from Panama City, Panama, in 1901.
