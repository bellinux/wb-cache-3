Leto said about his character, [...] "That phrase staying in character to me really means commitment, focus, and for a role like this that's so intense and challenging and extreme in a lot of ways, it demanded my full attention." ...|$|E

500|$|On December 17, 2013, LaBeouf {{released}} his short film Howard Cantour.com to the Internet; shortly thereafter, several bloggers noted its close similarity to Justin M. Damiano, a 2007 comic by Ghost World creator Dan Clowes. Wired journalist Graeme McMillan noted {{at least three}} similarities in their article, {{one of which was}} that the opening monologue for the short and the comic were identical. LaBeouf would later remove the film and claim that he did not intend to copy Clowes but was instead [...] "inspired" [...] by him and [...] "got lost in the creative process." [...] He followed this up with several apologies via Twitter writing, [...] "In my excitement and naiveté as an amateur filmmaker, I got lost in the creative process and neglected to follow proper accreditation", and [...] "I deeply regret the manner in which these events have unfolded and want @danielclowes to know that I have a great respect for his work". Clowes responded by saying [...] "The first I ever heard of the film was this morning when someone sent me a link. I've never spoken to or <b>met</b> <b>Mr.</b> LaBeouf ... I actually can't imagine what was going through his mind." [...] LaBeouf was criticized over his apology, with some sites such as The A.V. Club noting that the apology itself appeared to have been lifted from a 2010 post on Yahoo! Answers.|$|E

Casey Bond wrote for GOBankingRates, [...] "Theoretically, you could just read the list {{at the end of every}} chapter and get the gist of the book, but I find the value of Midas Touch to be in the storytelling of real-life experiences." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Knature of a Girl" [...] was {{the first}} record by the Shamen to feature Sinnott, {{but it was not}} until June's [...] "Jesus Loves Amerika" [...] single that the techno {{influence}} began to show. By this stage, Angus and Sinnott had become hooked on the acid house movement taking place in London, and its music and clubs were to exert a massive influence on the pair. Keith McKenzie and Peter Stephenson were less impressed by these new developments, and left the group the following summer, after the January 1989 release of the In Gorbachev We Trust album, which saw the group further enhancing their sound. Over the summer 1988, they <b>met</b> <b>Mr.</b> C and Evil Eddie Richards, who would later both work with the Shamen to help them transition their music into the rave scene.|$|E

2500|$|Lantern Waste: In northwestern Narnia, west of The Wild Lands of The North. Here Jadis, Polly Plummer, Digory Kirke, Uncle Andrew, Frank and his horse, Strawberry, {{witnessed}} {{the creation of}} Narnia. During the creation Jadis threw {{a piece of a}} London lamppost at Aslan's head. When it fell to the ground, it grew into a new lamppost because Aslan's song of creation was causing all things planted in the ground to grow. Centuries later Lucy Pevensie <b>met</b> <b>Mr</b> Tumnus near the Lamppost, which is now a relic that no one knows much about, although it still casts light. In Prince Caspian, we learn that Edmund Pevensie is [...] "Duke of the Lantern Waste". Lantern Waste remains a prominent location throughout the series of novels, and it is here that the last battle is fought for Narnia. (MN, LWW, LB) ...|$|E

Mr. Theo normally expresses himself with great formalism and precision, but he is prone to malapropisms such as [...] "It is time for us to level upon each other" [...] and [...] "You're barking up the right hydrant." [...] Canon Tallis says in The Young Unicorns that he <b>met</b> <b>Mr.</b> Theo in Paris; perhaps English is not his first language.
