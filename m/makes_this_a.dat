25|$|Construction of {{wastewater}} treatment plants and reduction of groundwater overdrafting appear to be obvious solutions to the worldwide problem; however, a deeper look reveals more fundamental issues in play.

25|$|The {{works of}} Fra Angelico reveal {{elements}} that are both conservatively Gothic and progressively Renaissance. In the altarpiece of the Coronation of the Virgin, painted for the Florentine church of Santa Maria Novella, are all the elements that a very expensive altarpiece of the 14th century was expected to provide; a precisely tooled gold background, lots of azure, lots of vermilion and an obvious display of arsenic green. The workmanship of the gilded haloes and gold-edged robes is exquisite and all very Gothic. What <b>makes</b> <b>this</b> <b>a</b> Renaissance painting, as against Gentile da Fabriano's masterpiece, is the solidity, the three-dimensionality and naturalism of the figures and the realistic way in which their garments hang or drape around them. Even though it is clouds these figures stand upon, and not the earth, they do so with weight.|$|E

500|$|In a 1998 {{interview}} with journalist George Plimpton, Angelou discussed her writing process, and [...] "the sometimes slippery notion {{of truth in}} nonfiction" [...] and memoirs. [...] When asked if she changed the truth to improve her story, she stated, [...] "Sometimes I make a diameter from a composite {{of three or four}} people, because the essence in only one person is not sufficiently strong to be written about." [...] Although Angelou has never admitted to changing the facts in her stories, she has used these facts to make an impact with the reader. As Hagen stated, [...] "One can assume that 'the essence of the data' is present in Angelou's work". [...] Hagen also stated that Angelou [...] "fictionalizes, to enhance interest". Angelou's long-time editor, Robert Loomis, states that she could rewrite any of her books by changing the order of her facts to make a different impact on the reader. [...] Like Caged Bird, the events in Mom & Me & Mom and the rest of her autobiographies are episodic and crafted as a series of short stories, yet do not follow a strict chronology, something that Angelou uses to compel her readers forward. [...] Sayers agrees, saying that Angelou pays little attention to chronological order in the book. [...] Sayers also states, [...] "Time races through this narrative". [...] Major characters, like Angelou's stepfather Daddy Clidell, disappear after their initial mention. [...] Even though Angelou repeats many anecdotes found in her earlier autobiographies, the focus in Mom & Me & Mom is on her mother; according to reviewer Stacy Russo, [...] "that focus <b>makes</b> <b>this</b> <b>a</b> distinct addition to Angelou's autobiographical writings". [...] Reviewer Pam Kingsbury, who highly recommended the book for all audiences, stated those familiar with Angelou's previous works [...] "will be rewarded with a more complete picture of her life", while new readers [...] "will discover a well-crafted and insightful introduction to the author".|$|E

2500|$|It is {{important}} to distinguish primary glioblastoma from secondary glioblastoma. These tumors occur spontaneously (de novo) or have progressed from a lower-grade glioma, respectively. Primary glioblastomas have a worse prognosis, different tumor biology and may have a different response to therapy, which <b>makes</b> <b>this</b> <b>a</b> critical evaluation to determine patient prognosis and therapy. Over 80% of secondary glioblastoma carries a mutation in IDH1, whereas this mutation is rare in primary glioblastoma (5–10%). Thus, IDH1 mutations are a useful tool to distinguish primary and secondary glioblastomas [...] since histopathologically they are very similar and the distinction without molecular biomarkers is unreliable.|$|E

2500|$|Four {{significantly}} different habitats {{are common in}} the aspen parklands: The fescue prairie, the woodlands, the ravines and the wetlands and lakes. [...] A rarer habitat type, tallgrass aspen parkland, occurs only in the extreme southeastern corner of the aspen parklands biome (southeastern Manitoba/northwestern Minnesota). The fescue prairie is a meadowland rich in vegetation variety which forms the cover {{for the development of}} the richer soils that underlie the parklands. The close association with woodlands and wetlands <b>makes</b> <b>this</b> <b>a</b> choice location for many plants and a preferred range or home site for a wide diversity of wildlife. The richer soil and increased precipitation favours the natural growth of fescue grass. [...] However, varying conditions such as moisture level and grazing pressures allow for the invasion of secondary plant species.|$|E

Time of death in a homicide case {{can make the difference}} between bringing criminals to justice and a cold case. Therefore, this has been the main focus of the Body Farm since it was opened. With the progression of research, [...] Bass is hopeful that in the future, entomologists will be able to declare time of death within a half-day. What <b>makes</b> <b>this</b> <b>a</b> difficult task to accomplish is that every minute that passes after death, the range of time they can correctly estimate time of death is broadened dramatically. The Body Farm's success over the past 36 years is directly responsible for a vast amount of the overwhelming progress in narrowing that range. When asked about the growth of the Body Farm in the future, [...] Bass insinuated that the Body Farm is too small right now and a higher percentage of land area that has not been contaminated by other burials is needed for future achievements.

2500|$|The {{relationships}} adolescents {{have with}} their peers, family, {{and members of}} their social sphere {{play a vital role}} in the social development of an adolescent. As an adolescent's social sphere develops rapidly as they distinguish the differences between friends and acquaintances, they often become heavily emotionally invested in friends. This is not harmful; however, if these friends expose an individual to potentially harmful situations, this is an aspect of peer pressure. Adolescence is a critical period in social development because adolescents can be easily influenced by the people they develop close relationships with. This is the first time individuals can truly make their own decisions, which also <b>makes</b> <b>this</b> <b>a</b> sensitive period. Relationships are vital in the social development of an adolescent due to the extreme influence peers can have over an individual. These relationships become significant because they begin to help the adolescent understand the concept of personalities, how they form and why a person has that specific type of personality. [...] "The use of psychological comparisons could serve both as an index of the growth of an implicit personality theory and as a component process accounting for its creation. In other words, by comparing one person's personality characteristics to another's, we would be setting up the framework for creating a general theory of personality (and,... such a theory would serve as a useful framework for coming to understand specific persons)." [...] This can be likened to the use of social comparison in developing one's identity and self-concept, which includes ones personality, and underscores the importance of communication, and thus relationships, in one's development. In social comparison we use reference groups, with respect to both psychological and identity development. These reference groups are the peers of adolescents. This means that who the teen chooses/accepts as their friends and who they communicate with on a frequent basis often makes up their reference groups and can therefore have a huge impact on who they become. Research shows that relationships have the largest affect over the social development of an individual.|$|E
