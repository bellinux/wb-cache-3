50|$|In E. coli {{and other}} bacteria, glucosyltransferase and glucosidase {{functions}} are performed by two distinct enzymes. In E. coli, Glucose transfer is performed by 4-alpha-glucanotransferase, a 78.5 kDa protein coded {{for by the}} gene malQ. A second protein, referred to as debranching enzyme, performs α-1,6-glucose cleavage. This enzyme has a molecular mass of 73.6 kDa, and is coded for by the gene glgX. Activity of the two enzymes is not always necessarily coupled. In E. coli glgX selectively catalyzes the cleavage of 4-subunit branches, without the action of glucanotransferase. The product of this cleavage, <b>maltotetraose,</b> is further degraded by maltodextrin phosphorylase.|$|E
40|$|Malto-oligosaccharides {{have high}} {{potential}} as food ingredient, {{due to their}} beneficial effects on the flavour and physico-chemical properties of food products. They have mild sweetness, increase the viscosity and have been suggested to delay the retrogradation of starch. As native starch is only slowly degradable by amylases, the first steps in the conversion of starch are gelatinization and liquefaction of the starch polymers. The obtained maltodextrins can then be used for saccharification, i. e. the further hydrolysis to malto-oligosaccharides. Depending on {{the properties of the}} amylases used for saccharification, different malto-oligosaccharide enriched syrups can be obtained. In this study, a maltotriose producing amylase from Microbacterium imperiale and a <b>maltotetraose</b> producing amylase from Pseudomonas stutzeri were used to produce maltotriose and <b>maltotetraose</b> enriched syrups, respectively. The maltotriose producing amylase showed the highest activity around 40 °C and pH 6. 5 – 7. 5 while this was reached around 50 °C and pH 5. 5 – 6. 5 for the <b>maltotetraose</b> producing amylase. These data were used to optimize the production of maltotriose and <b>maltotetraose</b> syrups. The highest yields of maltotriose were obtained after incubation of a 20 % maltodextrin solution with 5. 6 units maltotriose producing amylase / g dry matter (dm) maltodextrin for 36 h at 40 °C and pH 5. 5. One enzyme unit is the amount of enzyme that releases 1 µmol reducing sugars per mL from a 1. 0 % soluble starch solution per min at pH 6. 0 and 40 °C. Incubation of a 20 % maltodextrin solution with 3. 5 units <b>maltotetraose</b> producing amylase / g dm maltodextrin for 28 h at 50 °C and pH 5. 5 gave the highest yields of <b>maltotetraose.</b> The obtained syrups were further enriched in maltotriose or <b>maltotetraose</b> in one step by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and collecting specific fractions, or in two steps by selective fermentation of glucose, maltose (and maltotriose) in the syrups with specific yeast strains and ethanol precipitation to remove larger glucose chains.

The <b>maltotetraose</b> conformation has surprising implications, as it is unusual in terms of the sugar literature but {{the same as that of}} maltoheptaose bound to glycogen phosphorylase a (Goldsmith et al., Journal of Molecular Biology 156 : 411 - 427, 1983). The complex suggests explanations for an unexpectedly low binding affinity for <b>maltotetraose.</b> MBP was co-crystallized with alpha-cyclodextrin and beta-cyclodextrin; data has been collected from the latter crystal. Crystals and data were also obtained for sugar-free MBP. The current model of transport by this system suggests a conformational change in MBP upon sugar binding which is recognized by the transport system. A mutation in the hinge region of MBP produced a ligand-specific effect on transport; crystals of this mutant with two different ligands were grown. Two further experiments use MBP for general studies of protein structure.

The CMM-forming enzyme had a molecular mass of 71. 7 kDa and a pI of 3. 6. The enzyme was most active at pH 6. 0 and 50 °C and was stable from pH 5. 0 to 9. 0 and up to 30 °C. The addition of 1 mM Ca 2 + enhanced the thermal stability of the enzyme up to 45 °C. The enzyme acted on maltooligosaccharides that have degrees of polymerization of ≥ 3, amylose, and soluble starch to produce CMM but failed to act on cyclomaltodextrins, pullulan, and dextran. The mechanism for the synthesis of CMM from <b>maltotetraose</b> was determined as follows: (i) <b>maltotetraose</b> + <b>maltotetraose</b> → 64 -O-α-maltosyl-maltotetraose + maltose and (ii) 64 -O-α-maltosyl-maltotetraose → CMM + maltose.

The pH and temperature optima for {{activity of the}} purified enzyme were 5. 5 to 6. 0 and 65 degrees C. The molecular weight was calculated to be 62, 000. The Km for starch was 0. 39 mg/ml.

40|$|The {{degradation}} and utilization of starch by three amylolytic and one nonamylolytic species of ruminal bacteria were studied. Pure cultures of Streptococcus bovis JB 1, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49, and Bacteroides ruminicola D 31 d rapidly hydrolyzed starch and maltooligosaccharides accumulated. The major starch hydrolytic products detected in S. bovis cultures were glucose, maltose, maltotriose, and <b>maltotetraose.</b> In {{addition to these}} oligosaccharides, B. fibrisolvens cultures produced maltopentaose. The products of starch hydrolysis by B. ruminicola were even more complex, yielding glucose through <b>maltotetraose,</b> maltohexaose, and maltoheptaose but little maltopentaose. Selenomonas ruminantium HD 4 grew poorly on starch, digested {{only a small portion}} of the available substrate, and generated no detectable oligosaccharides as a result of cultivation in starch containing medium. S. ruminantium was able to grow on a mixture of maltooligosaccharides and utilize those of lower degree (less than 10) of polymerization. A coculture system containing S. ruminantium as a dextrin-utilizing species and each of the three amylolytic bacteria was developed to test whether the products of starch hydrolysis were available for crossfeeding to another ruminal bacterium. Cocultures of S. ruminantium and S. bovis contained large numbers of S. bovis but relatively few S. ruminantium and exhibited little change in the pattern of maltooligosaccharides observed for pure cultures of S. bovis. In contrast, S. ruminantium was able to compete with B. fibrisolvens and B. ruminicola for these growth substrates. When grown with B. fibrisolvens, S. ruminantium grew to high numbers and maltooligosaccharides accumulated to a much lesser degree than in cultures of B. fibrisolvens alone. S. ruminantium-B. ruminicola cultures contained large numbers of both species, and maltooligosaccharides never accumulated in these cocultures. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Biochemical and enzymatic {{characterisation}} {{has been}} achieved for the Tyr 151 Met (Y 151 M) mutant of human salivary α-amylase (HSA). Substantial transglycosylation capacity was detected in Y 151 M {{in addition to its}} hydrolytic activity. Y 151 M was capable of transferring maltose and maltotriose residues from a <b>maltotetraose</b> donor onto different 4 -nitrophenyl glycosides resulting in the formation of 1 -thio-β-D-glucosides, β- and α-D-glucosides and β-D-xylosides with DP 2 - 4 in yields up to 50 %. Reactions were monitored using TLC, HPLC and MALDI-TOF MS. 1 H and 13 C NMR studies revealed that the Y 151 M preserved its stereo- and regio-selectivity. Glycosylation took place at position 4 of the glycosyl acceptors, resulting in the new α- 1, 4 -glycosidic bonds exclusively...|$|E

Bacteriol. 86 : 1196 – 1201. 1963. —The maximal differential rate (K) of α-amylase synthesis was usually {{two to three}} times that of the sucrose control culture, over an inducer concentration range of 5 × 10 − 4 to 1 × 10 − 3 m. With <b>maltotetraose,</b> higher concentrations decreased the K value, whereas higher concentrations of maltose were needed to obtain maximal K values. Glucose, in concentrations from 10 − 5 to 10 − 2 m, had no effect on the differential rate of enzyme synthesis. Cultures growing on maltotriose, <b>maltotetraose,</b> maltopentaose, and maltohexaose exhibited the same growth rate (k) and differential rate of α-amylase synthesis over a concentration range of 2. 92 × 10 − 4 to 1. 46 × 10 − 2 m. Growth of cultures in various concentrations of pure maltose revealed that with concentrations of maltose ranging from 2. 92 × 10 − 3 to 1. 46 × 10 − 2 m the K value for α-amylase production increased 18 -fold. The amount of maltose utilized, during the growth period, at each concentration of maltose, was constant. Diauxic type growth was observed when maltose was used in addition to another carbon source (i. e., glucose, glycerol, fructose, or sucrose). Maltose was not utilized until the other carbon source had been metabolized. Phenyl-, methyl-, and ethyl-α-d-glucoside and methyl-β-d-maltoside were good inducers of α-amylase and would not serve as a carbon source in a chemically defined medium supplemented with 0. 1 % casein hydrolysate. These compounds were therefore gratuitous inducers of α-amylase. Isomaltose, panose, butyl-α-d-glucoside, and methyl-α-d-maltotetraoside were not effective as inducers of α-amylase. Fructose had an inhibitory effect on constitutive (41 %) and inducible (55 %) α-amylase formation; glucose had no effect...|$|E
