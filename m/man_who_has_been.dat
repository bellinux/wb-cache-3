Dion thanks the man (Paul Raskin) for finding the victim for him, but is chided for not committing the murder while Black was in the area. Dion takes the corpse into the woods to bury it, all the while speaking to it as though in conversation.|$|E
5|$|The film {{opens to}} a shot of an {{abandoned}} office, where the main character (Pierre Jolivet), who is only identified as 'The Man' in the end credits, is having intercourse with a sex doll. The Man is then seen attempting to salvage parts from abandoned vehicles, but returns to his dwelling empty handed, where he works on building a makeshift aircraft. The Man ventures outside the office building he lives in, which is surrounded by a desert wasteland. A group of men are shown surviving in the wasteland. They hold a man, 'The Dwarf' (Maurice Lamy), captive, and force him to retrieve water for them. The <b>Man,</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> observing the survivors, makes his way to their camp, stabs their leader, 'The Captain' (Fritz Wepper) and retrieves a car battery. Survivors pursue The Man, though he is able to escape in his now completed aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The novel's protagonist is Lucius, a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> magically {{transformed}} into a donkey. In the eleventh and last book of the novel, Lucius, after falling asleep {{on the beach at}} Cenchreae in Greece, wakes to see the full moon. He prays to the moon, using the names of several moon goddesses known in the Greco-Roman world, asking her to restore him to human form. Isis appears in a vision before Lucius and declares herself the greatest of all goddesses. She tells him that a festival in her honor, the Navigium Isidis, is taking place nearby, and that the festival procession carries with it garlands of roses that will restore his human form if he eats them. After Lucius becomes human again, the high priest at the festival declares that he has been saved from his misfortunes by the goddess, and that he will now be free of the inquisitiveness and self-indulgence that drew him into many of his earlier misadventures. Lucius joins the local temple of Isis, becomes her devoted follower, and eventually undergoes initiation.|$|E

Ivy's bag shows that she has stolen money from Carol and plans on returning to New York. A later scene shows a positive pregnancy test in a trash can at Blair's bathroom being thrown out by Dorota (Zuzanna Szadkowski).|$|E

The real Marcus Junius Brutus was the most famous of Julius Caesar's assassins, and one of the key figures in the civil wars that followed the assassination.|$|E

However, {{the criminal}} law of China had been amended in August 2015 thus males can be victims of indecency, but the articles on the criminal law which are related to rape still remain unrevised, so male rape victims can only accuse the rapists of indecency.|$|E

25|$|Not all {{cardinals}} are bishops. Domenico Bartolucci, Karl Josef Becker, Roberto Tucci and Albert Vanhoye {{are examples}} of 21st-century non-bishop cardinals. The 1917 Code of Canon Law introduced the requirement that a cardinal {{must be at least}} a priest. Previously, they need only be in minor orders and not even deacons. Teodolfo Mertel, who died in 1899, was the last non-priest cardinal. In 1962, Pope John XXIII made it a rule that a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> nominated a cardinal is required to be consecrated a bishop, if not one already, but some ask for and obtain dispensation from this requirement. It is rare that the Pope will appoint Cardinals who are priests only and not consecrated as a bishop.|$|E

(Hat man nicht auch Gold beineben—"If you don't have money on you"). Fidelio demands to know why Rocco will not allow for help in the dungeons, especially as he always seems to return short of breath. Rocco says that there is a dungeon down there where he can never take Fidelio, which houses a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> wasting away for two years. Marzelline begs her father to keep Leonore away from such a terrible sight. Rocco and Leonore sing of courage (Gut, Söhnchen, gut—"All right, sonny, all right"), and Marzelline joins in their acclamations.|$|E

25|$|Decades ago, Howard Stark {{worked with}} Anton Vanko {{to build the}} first arc reactor, but when Howard {{realized}} Vanko's greedy goals, he had him arrested and deported before, {{at the urging of}} Obadiah Stane, returning to the business of arms dealing that made him so successful in the past. In the present, Stark's son Tony uses the arc reactor technology to power his Iron Man armor, and after revealing this identity to the world, becomes a public hero. U.S. General Thaddeus Ross commissions Stark's business rival Justin Hammer to build a single-pilot vehicle to replace Iron <b>Man,</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> interfering with and causing trouble for the military. When testing the new vehicle, the pilot crash lands in unfriendly territory, under attack from the Congolese army. Tony saves the airman, but, to the chagrin of Ross, refuses to return the Congolese soldiers' fire. Director Nick Fury and Agent Phil Coulson of S.H.I.E.L.D. later review Stark's actions.|$|E
500|$|The protagonist {{and player}} {{character}} of Silent Hill 4 is Henry Townshend, {{a resident of}} the South Ashfield Heights Apartments building in the fictitious town of Ashfield. Henry is an [...] "average" [...] <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> described by Konami as an introvert in his late 20s. For the most part Henry navigates the game's world alone, although he eventually works with his neighbor Eileen Galvin. Henry also deals with the new supporting characters of Cynthia Velázquez, Andrew DeSalvo, Richard Braintree and Jasper Gein.|$|E
500|$|David Jeffries of Allmusic {{gave the}} album a mildly {{positive}} review, citing Arjona's {{return to his}} more mainstream style after the [...] "stripped-down acoustic effort" [...] Poquita Ropa. He compared (as did Arjona and other critics) the production values and musical style of Independiente with past albums Animal Nocturno and Historias. Finally, he stated that [...] "Returning fans will revel in this combination of freedom and growth, and appreciate the return of producer Tommy Torres, the <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> behind the boards for {{quite a few of}} Arjona's most popular releases" [...] (referring to Torres' absence from the production of Poquita Ropa).|$|E

Although many of Maycomb's citizens disapprove, Atticus agrees to defend Tom {{to the best}} of his ability. Other children taunt Jem and Scout for Atticus's actions, calling him a [...] "nigger-lover". Scout is tempted to stand up for her father's honor by fighting, even though he has told her not to. Atticus faces a group of men intent on lynching Tom. This danger is averted when Scout, Jem, and Dill shame the mob into dispersing by forcing them to view the situation from Atticus' and Tom's perspective.|$|E
500|$|Extreme {{isolation}} from society and community is also apparent in Crane's work. [...] During {{the most intense}} battle scenes in The Red Badge of Courage, for example, the story's focus is mainly [...] "on the inner responses of a self unaware of others". In [...] "The Open Boat", [...] "An Experiment in Misery" [...] and other stories, Crane uses light, motion and color to express degrees of epistemological uncertainty. Similar to other Naturalistic writers, Crane scrutinizes the position of <b>man,</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> isolated not only from society, but also from God and nature. [...] "The Open Boat", for example, distances itself from Romantic optimism and affirmation of man's {{place in the world}} by concentrating on the characters' isolation.|$|E
500|$|Radcliffe is a {{supporter}} of the Labour Party. Until 2012, Radcliffe had publicly supported the Liberal Democrats, and before the 2010 general election Radcliffe endorsed Nick Clegg, the Lib Dem leader. In 2012, however, Radcliffe switched his allegiance to the Labour Party, citing disappointment with the performance of Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats in government, and approving of the Labour leader, Ed Miliband. In August 2015, Radcliffe endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. He told The Big Issue: [...] "...I feel like this show of sincerity by a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> around long enough and stuck to his beliefs long enough that he knows them and doesn't have to be scripted is what is making people sit up and get excited.
