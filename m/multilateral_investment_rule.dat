40|$|International {{agreements}} increasingly {{constrain the}} ability of governments to use trade policies whereas few constraints apply {{to the use of}} investment policies. Using a model in which a local and a foreign firm compete in the domestic market, we analyse whether the foreign firm may be forced to adopt an inefficient mode of supply (exports versus FDI) when the domestic government is constrained in its ability to use trade policy, but is free to set its FDI policy. We find that the foreign firm chooses the efficient mode of supply, even under a discriminatory output tax levied on FDI. This result suggests that the case for <b>multilateral</b> <b>investment</b> <b>rules</b> on efficiency grounds needs careful evaluation. foreign direct investment; modes of supply; national treatment; neutrality; oligopoly; trade policy...|$|R

40|$|The WTO Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) is the {{predominant}} multilateral legal framework governing agricultural trade. The {{objective of the}} AoA is to liberalise trade in agriculture through reductions in tariffs, domestic support and export subsidies. The AoA has not, however, ‘levelled the playing field’ and has not resulted in the equitable distribution of food, particularly for the poorer developing countries. On the other hand, support for small farmers does not ensure food security for the poor. While food security has no simple solutions such as “free trade is good for you”, reform proposals for trade rules which only address agricultural policy instruments fail to account for consumer and other interests: neither tariff reductions and subsidy disciplines, nor safeguards and other measures of producer protection can automatically increase food security. Rather, {{what is needed is}} the full and proper implementation of a number of commitments which the international community has already entered into in various human rights treaties, but which even the envisaged results of the now failed Doha Round negotiations could not ensure without revisiting relevant <b>multilateral</b> trade and <b>investment</b> <b>rules...</b>|$|R

40|$|Initially, {{bilateral}} investment treaties (2 ̆ 2 BITs 2 ̆ 2) {{were intended}} as legal instruments {{to promote and}} protect investments from rich capital exporting states to the developing world. While BITs signed between developing countries (hereinafter South-South BITs) began {{to emerge from the}} mid- 1960 s onwards with the 1964 Kuwait-Iraq BIT, a typical BIT was until recently negotiated between a developed and a developing country (hereinafter North-South BITs). In order to examine these questions, this paper will investigate whether there are systematic differences in investment-rule making between South-South and North-South BITs. As noted by UNCTAD in its cursory review of South-South BITs, such an analysis has to be comprehensive and detailed enough to credibly identify whether or not South-South BITs in fact incorporate specific features. Accordingly, this paper will utilize a newly constructed database with 303 BITs signed by 101 countries from 1994 to 2006 analyzed according to a set of quantitative indicators of investment provisions, which in turn allows large-sample statistical analyses. Space constraints naturally preclude a comprehensive examination of the similarities and differences between all substantial and procedural BIT provisions. The focus is therefore on two clauses, which have often been in dispute between developing countries and developed countries in <b>multilateral</b> discussions on <b>investment</b> <b>rules</b> in the past, namely (post-entry) national treatment provisions and provisions on repatriation of investment-related funds...|$|R

40|$|This paper models a <b>multilateral</b> {{agreement}} on <b>investment</b> (MAI) as a coordination device. Multinational enterprises can invest {{in any number}} of countries. Without a <b>multilateral</b> <b>investment</b> agreement, expropriation triggers an investment stop by the single MNE. Under a multilateral agreement, expropriation leads to a joint reaction by all MNEs. Switching to such a regime increases worldwide FDI and raises the world interest rate. Distinguishing three groups of countries, we show that industrialized countries experience an outflow of capital but benefit overall due to an increase in repatriated profits. Middle income countries are likely to gain from increased inward FDI, whereas least developed countries lose because they receive less FDI. Our results explain the stylized fact that a <b>multilateral</b> <b>investment</b> agreement was opposed by least developed nations and certain groups in rich countries. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{investments}} in international agreements on investment protection The {{concept of an}} investment {{is one of the}} fundamental constructs in the international investment law, as it is crucial for determination of bilateral or <b>multilateral</b> <b>investment</b> protection treaties' scope of protection regarding particular economic activity of investors in the host state territory. The purpose of this thesis is to provide examples of possible solutions of the dichotomy in the apprehension of the investment concept and its interpretation in practice, in particular with regards to the decisions of arbitral tribunals. A historical analysis of understanding of the investment concept is provided together with its current and historical interpretations in bilateral and <b>multilateral</b> <b>investment</b> protection treaties; with an emphasis that at present, there is no uniform legal definition of the concept of an investment. An absence of such definition does not limit the flow of foreign investments or the conclusion of bilateral or <b>multilateral</b> <b>investment</b> protection treaties, which contain broad definitions of this concept. At the same time, it is possible to trace a tendency to determine objective elements common to all investments, while the primary inspiration is drawn from the economic science and its concept of [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{learning}} of optimal discrete <b>investment</b> <b>rules</b> is analysed {{and related to}} the problem of forecasting financial returns.

A consistent estimator for discrete <b>investment</b> <b>rules</b> is used and it is shown, using simulations, that direct estimation of <b>investment</b> <b>rules</b> is preferable to the estimation of forecasting models to be used in such rules.

In {{the absence of a}} comprehensive agreement, bilateral investment treaties serve as the primary legal instruments setting forth the terms of cross-border investments.

40|$|The {{political}} will to establish {{a link between the}} ASEAN Free Trade Area and the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Agreement has generated a number of issues. This paper looks at the scope for a medium term investment linkage. The paper does not canvas the specific issue of formal <b>investment</b> <b>rules</b> within an AFTA-CER agreement, but examines facilitation and cooperation initiatives that can be undertaken. Incorporating investment in the AFTA-CER dialogue is interesting since investment is not explicitly in either agreement. AFTA members have proposed an ASEAN Investment Area (AIA), but this concept is still in its infancy. Australian reluctance to include investment in the CER has led not only its exclusion, but also no initiatives to bring it within the agreement, to complete the so-called "missing " link. The AFTA-CER investment question also arises against a backdrop of regional and <b>multilateral</b> <b>investment</b> initiatives such as within APEC and the OECD. This means that any initiative should, at the very least, not be duplicative and complement these regional and multilateral efforts. The paper puts forth specific and practical proposals to initiate an AFTA-CER dialogue. As a start, the paper proposes including Australia and New Zealand as observers i...|$|R
