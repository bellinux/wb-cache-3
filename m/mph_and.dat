5|$|During John's {{time in the}} Western North Pacific, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) had {{particular}} difficulty in forecasting and even estimating the strength of John. John weakened considerably after entering the Western North Pacific, and, before estimates were later revised, four consecutive advisories were issued that declared John a tropical depression. Each of these advisories called for imminent dissipation. As John persisted and did not dissipate as the JTWC had predicted, it was upgraded to a minimal tropical storm in the next advisory. At the same time, however, two separate ship reports indicated that John had sustained winds of at least 55 knots (100 km/h, 65 mph), far stronger than the advisory strength of 35 knots (65 km/h, 40 mph). John {{would go on to}} restrengthen into a strong Category 1 hurricane after reentering the Central North Pacific, defying all JTWC predictions. After later reanalysis, the JTWC raised the estimated wind speeds of John for every advisory from 1200 UTC September 1 to its final advisory exactly a week later by at least 5 knots (9 km/h, 6 <b>mph)</b> <b>and</b> as much as 25 knots (46 km/h, 29 mph).|$|E
5|$|In 2012, the NHC {{expanded}} the windspeed range for Category 4 by 1mph in both directions, to 130–156mph, with corresponding {{changes in the}} other units (113–136 kn, 209–251km/h), instead of 131–155mph (114–135 kn, 210–249km/h). The NHC and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center assign tropical cyclone intensities in 5 knot increments, and then convert to <b>mph</b> <b>and</b> km/h with a similar rounding for other reports. So an intensity of 115 knots is rated Category 4, but the conversion to miles per hour (132.3mph) would round down to 130mph, making it {{appear to be a}} Category 3 storm. Likewise, an intensity of 135 knots (~155mph, and thus Category 4) is 250.02km/h, which according to the definition used before the change would be Category 5. To resolve these issues, the NHC had been obliged to incorrectly report storms with wind speeds of 115 kn as 135mph, and 135 kn as 245km/h. The change in definition allows storms of 115 kn to be correctly rounded down to 130mph, and storms of 135 kn to be correctly reported as 250km/h, and still qualify as Category 4. Since the NHC had previously rounded incorrectly to keep storms in Category 4 in each unit of measure, the change does not affect the classification of storms from previous years. The new scale became operational on May 15, 2012.|$|E
5|$|Initially, forecasters {{anticipated}} Babe {{to maintain}} its westward course as it strengthened and threaten the Philippines; however, its forward motion gradually slowed as it neared the region. On September 5, an upper-level trough formed over northeastern Asia and created a weakness in the subtropical ridge, allowing Babe to turn north-northwestward. Over the following two days, the storm quickly strengthened as divergence increased ahead of the storm, with Babe attaining typhoon status early on September 6 Between 0832 UTC on September 5 and 2204 UTC on September 7, the storm's barometric pressure dropped from 988 mbar (hPa; 29.18 inHg) to 907 mbar (hPa; 26.79 inHg), approximately 1.3 mbar (hPa; 0.04 inHg) per hour. Early on September 8, Babe attained its peak intensity with winds of 240 km/h (150 mph) while situated approximately 465 km (290 mi) southeast of Ishigaki Island. This ranked it as {{the first and only}} super typhoon of the 1977 season. At this time, the Japan Meteorological Agency estimated the storm to have had peak ten-minute sustained winds of 205 km/h (125 <b>mph)</b> <b>and</b> a minimum pressure of 905 mbar (hPa; 26.72 inHg).|$|E

5|$|Tropical Cyclone Sose was a {{moderate}} storm system that chiefly impacted the island nation of Vanuatu in early April 2001. The developing cyclone was first detected on April 3, while situated {{well to the}} northeast of Vanuatu. As atmospheric conditions became more conducive to intensification, the disturbance gradually consolidated as it drifted toward the west-southwest. After receiving the name Sose on April 5, the cyclone was driven southeastward, passing just west of Espiritu Santo and neighboring islands. Although it never made landfall, Sose was particularly expansive, producing a wide area of gale-force winds. The cyclone peaked in strength between April 7 and 8 with maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 110 km/h (70 <b>mph)</b> <b>and</b> 1-minute sustained winds of 130 km/h (80 mph), placing it at Category 2 intensity on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. Ultimately, stronger wind shear and an increasingly hostile upper-air pattern took their toll on the cyclone as it progressed due south; Sose lost tropical characteristics to the northeast of Norfolk Island by April 12. The extratropical remnants of Sose continued into the Tasman Sea.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Karen was {{the most}} {{powerful}} tropical cyclone to strike the island of Guam, and has been {{regarded as one of}} the most destructive events in the island's history. It was first identified as a tropical disturbance on November 6, 1962, well to the southeast of Truk. Over the following two days, the system tracked generally northward and quickly intensified. Karen became a tropical storm late on November 7, and within two days it explosively intensified into a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale. Turning westward, the typhoon maintained its intensity and struck Guam with winds of 280 km/h (175 mph) on November 11. Once clear of the island, it strengthened slightly and reached its peak intensity on November 13 with winds of 295 km/h (185 <b>mph)</b> <b>and</b> a barometric pressure of 894 mb (hPa; 26.40 inHg). The storm then gradually turned northward as it weakened, brushing the Ryukyu Islands on November 15, before moving east-northeastward over the open waters of the Pacific. Karen continued to weaken and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on November 17 before losing its identity the following day between Alaska and Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Rita was {{the most}} {{damaging}} typhoon to affect northern Japan since 1965. A tropical depression developed on August9, 1975 over the South China Sea. The depression initially meandered offshore Taiwan, but after turning west, it was upgraded into a tropical storm on August19, only to {{turn back to the}} east. While growing considerably in size, Rita strengthened into a typhoon during the afternoon hours of the August21. Rita then accelerated to the north-northeast in response to a shortwave trough. Midday on August22, the typhoon reached its peak intensity, with winds of 145km/h (90 <b>mph)</b> <b>and</b> a minimum barometric pressure of 965mbar (28.5inHg). That evening, the typhoon weakened slightly before making landfall 55km (35mi) west of Osaka, with winds of 130km/h (80mph). Quickly crossing central and northern Honshu, Rita veered slightly northward before weakening into a tropical storm early on August23. On the next day, Rita merged with a cold front before transiting into an extratropical cyclone.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{throwing}} {{with his}} left hand as well as batting from the left, Sabathia is right-handed. Sabathia has six pitches: a cutter (89–92 MPH), a more used two-seam/sinker fastball (88–93 MPH), a Four seam fastball (89-94 mph), a curve ball (74-76 MPH), a slider (78–82 <b>MPH),</b> <b>and</b> changeup (82–84 MPH). Once ahead in the count, he primarily uses his changeup to strike out right-handed batters, and his slider to strike out left-handers. He also exhibits good command of his pitches, posting a 5.65 K/BB ratio in 2007. Throughout most of his career, Sabathia's four-seam fastball sat in the 92-96 mph range (topping out at 98 <b>mph)</b> <b>and</b> his sinking fastball averaged 89-93 mph (topping out at 96 mph), thus making him a power pitcher. Since 2013, Sabathia has become accustomed to being a control pitcher, in the 2017 he cut down his usage of the four-seamer (87-91 mph topping out at 93 <b>mph)</b> <b>and</b> favored the sinker and cutter.|$|E

25|$|A {{total of}} four {{companies}} decided to formally respond to Specification P.27/32, these being the Fairey, Hawker Aircraft, Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft, and Bristol Aeroplane Company. Of the submissions made, the Air Ministry selected Armstrong Whitworth and Fairey to produce prototypes to demonstrate their designs. On 10 March 1936, the first Fairey prototype, K4303, equipped with a Merlin I engine capable of generating 1,030hp, performed its maiden flight at Hayes, Middlesex. The prototype was promptly transferred to RAF Martlesham Heath, Woodbridge, Suffolk for service trials, during which it attained a maximum speed of 257 <b>MPH</b> <b>and</b> reportedly achieved a performance in advance of any contemporary day bomber.|$|E
25|$|Marco Andretti was {{the first}} driver to make a {{significant}} improvement on his starting position, putting himself tentatively on the pole.

Carpenter bumped Andretti off the top spot, but still had four drivers waiting to make attempts. Rookie Carlos Muñoz squeezed himself on to the front row, landing in second starting position. The final driver with a shot for the pole was Will Power, who was fastest in segment 1. Power's first lap was in the 229 mph range, but his third and fourth laps dropped off significantly. Power ended up 6th, and Ed Carpenter secured his first Indy 500 pole position.

25|$|During {{the winter}} of 1951, Nashville {{experienced}} the most severe blizzard in the city's history. From Sunday, January 28 to Tuesday, January 30, an ice storm produced an inch of sleet and freezing rain, gridlocking the city and cutting off the power supply to many neighborhoods. On the afternoon of Wednesday, January 31, a blizzard swept through the city with wind gusts in excess of 50 <b>mph</b> <b>and</b> visibility down to zero. Eight inches of snow were recorded, and commute around the city was virtually impossible. On the night of February 2, low temperatures reached -13 degrees Fahrenheit, causing pipelines to burst. Many Nashville residents lacked both electricity and water. Due to {{the severity of the}} ice storm and the blizzard that followed afterwards, this is known as the worst episode of winter weather in Nashville's history. The blizzard of 1951 holds third place for the most snow recorded in Nashville from a single storm system, behind the blizzard of 1892 and Winter Storm Jonas in 2016.|$|E
25|$|In later October 2006, a cut-off extratropical cyclone {{over the}} central north Pacific moved over {{an area of}} ocean with sea surface {{temperatures}} as high as 2 °C above normal, at 16– 18°C (60.8– 64.4°F), and stalled there for two days. By October 31, the system had acquired convection, a warmer-than-normal core, and an eye-like feature. During this time it had moved east, then northeast, and then northwest. On November 1, the system reached its peak intensity, and had estimated winds of 100km/h (60mph) and its most developed convection. After that, it slowly weakened, looped counter-clockwise, and headed east towards {{the west coast of}} North America. This system's center of circulation passed south of observation buoy 46637 on November 1. The buoy's lowest pressure reading was 989mb/hPa. Other buoys indicated that a rather large area of low pressure was associated with the system. Buoy 46637 was not at the system's center of circulation, so it is possible that this system had a lower minimum pressure than was actually measured. On November 2, wind shear started taking its toll, and all convection was gone by the next day, when it was located roughly 520mi (840km) off the coast of Oregon. On November 3, the storm made landfall on the Olympic Peninsula in the State of Washington, bringing tropical storm-like conditions to the Pacific Northwest, including sustained winds at 40 <b>mph</b> <b>and</b> wind gusts up to 60 mph. Following its landfall, the storm rapidly weakened and dissipated on the next day.|$|E
25|$|Imperial {{units are}} still used in {{ordinary}} conversation. Today, Canadians typically use {{a mix of}} metric and imperial measurements in their daily lives. However, {{the use of the}} metric and imperial systems varies by age. The older generation mostly uses the imperial system, while the younger generation more often uses the metric system. Newborns are measured in SI at hospitals, but the birth weight and length is also announced to family and friends in imperial units. Drivers' licences use SI units. In livestock auction markets, cattle are sold in dollars per hundredweight (short), whereas hogs are sold in dollars per hundred kilograms. Imperial units still dominate in recipes, construction, house renovation and gardening. Land is now surveyed and registered in metric units, although initial surveys used imperial units. For example, partitioning of farm land on the prairies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was done in imperial units; this accounts for imperial units of distance and area retaining wide use in the Prairie Provinces. The size of most apartments, condominiums and houses continues to be described in square feet rather than square metres, and carpet or flooring tile is purchased by the square foot. Motor-vehicle fuel consumption is reported in both litres per 100km and statute miles per imperial gallon, leading to the erroneous impression that Canadian vehicles are 20% more fuel-efficient than their apparently identical American counterparts for which fuel economy is reported in statute miles per US gallon (neither country specifies which gallon is used). Canadian railways maintain exclusive use of imperial measurements to describe train length (feet), train height (feet), capacity (tons), speed (<b>mph),</b> <b>and</b> trackage (miles).|$|E
