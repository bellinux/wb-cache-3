As well as consuming roots underground, <b>mole</b> crickets leave their burrows at night to forage for leaves and stems which they drag underground before consumption.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} extreme {{examples}} of colonial behavior in rodents are the eusocial naked <b>mole</b> rat and Damaraland <b>mole</b> rat. The naked <b>mole</b> rat lives completely underground and can form colonies of up to 80 individuals. Only one female and up to three males in the colony reproduce, {{while the rest of}} the members are smaller and sterile, and function as workers. Some individuals are of intermediate size. They help with the rearing of the young and can take the place of a reproductive if one dies. The Damaraland <b>mole</b> rat is characterized by having a single reproductively active male and female in a colony where the remaining animals are not truly sterile, but become fertile only if they establish a colony of their own.|$|E

40|$|Hydatidiform <b>moles</b> of two women, {{each with}} three molar pregnancies, were {{examined}} in order to study their origin. Multiple recurrences have previously been associated with women who have biparental complete hydatidiform <b>moles</b> (CHM). However, all the <b>moles</b> {{examined in this study}} were androgenetic CHM (AnCHM), indicating that recurrent (> 2) <b>moles,</b> particularly {{in the absence of a}} positive family history, may be androgenetic rather than biparental. These data suggest that some women have a specific liability for having AnCHM. Making the distinction between a biparental or an androgenetic origin of recurrent <b>moles</b> is of relevance for counselling and when considering therapeutic options. Therefore, we propose that all recurrent <b>moles</b> should be investigated using molecular techniques...|$|R

The frequency of <b>moles</b> declined with age and varied according to body site. Comparison of the findings with those of previous surveys-in New York in about 1950 and in Sydney in about 1970 -suggested that the frequency of <b>moles</b> has increased as malignant melanoma has become more common.

Originally three {{sides of the}} <b>Mole</b> served coal hoists and their related rail sidings linking them and there were cranes on the south-east face, also rail-served. The former hoist brick-faced plinths are still present (2017) around the north-west and east faces as are those {{on the rest of}} the two docks. In the twilight years of tanker unloading for the William Cory (Powell Duffryn) oilworks, short footbridges were provided from the <b>Mole</b> for works staff to access the brick plinths for the purpose of handling the flexible tanker oil discharge piping and supports and it was not unknown for rail tank wagons to be in use on the siding serving the north-west <b>Mole</b> face.|$|E
40|$|Marsupial <b>moles</b> (genus Notoryctes) are {{the most}} highly {{specialised}} burrowing marsupials. The specialisations of the appendicular musculo-skeletal system of the marsupial <b>moles</b> are extensive and widespread; the major alterations are concentrated in, but not restricted to, the forelimb. Many of the derived features of the muscular system appear to be adaptations for improving the mechanical advantage of the limbs for burrowing. A number of the specialisations of the muscular system of the marsupial <b>moles</b> are convergent with those previously documented in other fossorial mammals, including golden <b>moles,</b> rodents and armadillos. There are, however, a number of unique specialisations of the musculo-skeletal system of Notoryctes. The functional morphology of the locomotor apparatus of marsupial <b>moles</b> is interpreted {{on the basis of}} the descriptions of the anatomy of the skeletal and muscular systems. The burrowing technique of the marsupial <b>moles</b> is a modified form of the parasagittal digging method that is used by other fossorial mammals, such as golden <b>moles,</b> armadillos and some rodents including pocket gophers. Differences in the functional morphology of the hindlimb between marsupial <b>moles</b> and other fossorial mammals are a reflection of the fact that marsupial <b>moles</b> do not construct permanent open burrow systems, but instead constantly dig through loose soil, backfilling as they progress. The functional morphology of the tail is uniquely specialised in the marsupial <b>moles</b> to function as the fifth limb during the pentapedal burrowing locomotion of marsupial <b>moles.</b> Phylogenetic affinities of marsupial <b>moles</b> within the Marsupialia have long been enigmatic. While specialisation of the musculo-skeletal system have been so widespread as to obscure almost any phylogenetically relevant patterns, there is some evidence to support an association between notoryctids and peramelid bandicoots. Interspecific differences between the two species of marsupial <b>moles,</b> Notoryctes typhlops and N. caurinus, are minor...|$|R
