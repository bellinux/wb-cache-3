5|$|Moments {{after the}} two planes collided, the only <b>mayday</b> {{distress}} call radioed by the United Airlines crew was heard at 8:30a.m. plus 20 seconds. The crippled airlinernow missing about eight feet (2.5 m) of its right wingtrailed black smoke and flames as it spiraled earthward, and crashed into a then-empty patch of desert outside the town of Arden {{in what is now}} the unincorporated town of Enterprise. The nearly vertical impact and subsequent explosion instantly killed everyone on board.|$|E
5|$|A Junkers F.13 {{called at}} Lympne on 10 January 1923 {{to clear customs}} and then flew to Croydon where it was {{inspected}} by Secretary of State for Air Sir Samuel Hoare. In February, {{it was reported that}} Lympne had taken part in a test of the newly introduced <b>Mayday</b> radio signal used by aircraft to indicate that they were in distress. Georges Barbot won a prize of F.25,000 from Le Matin when he made a flight from St Inglevert to Lympne and back again on the same day, 6 May. He flew the route in a Dewoitine aircraft fitted with a Clerget engine. On landing a bracing wire in the undercarriage of the aircraft broke, but repairs were effected within half an hour. Problems starting the engine then delayed his departure slightly. On 28 October the Light Aircraft Trials were held (see below). In 1923, Air Union started a service flying newspapers to Lympne using a Farman F.60 Goliath.|$|E
5|$|Robert Wesley Rackstraw is {{a retired}} pilot and ex-convict who served on an army {{helicopter}} crew and other units during the Vietnam War. He {{came to the attention}} of the Cooper task force in February 1978, after he was arrested in Iran and deported to the U.S. to face explosive possession and check kiting charges. Several months later, while released on bail, Rackstraw attempted to fake his own death by radioing a false <b>mayday</b> call and telling controllers that he was bailing out of a rented plane over Monterey Bay. Police later arrested him in Fullerton on an additional charge of forging federal pilot licenses; the plane he claimed to have ditched was found, repainted, in a nearby hangar. Cooper investigators noted his physical resemblance to Cooper composite sketches (although he was only 28 in 1971), military parachute training, and criminal record, but eliminated him as a suspect in 1979 after no direct evidence of his involvement could be found.|$|E

5|$|Rosebeary, flying Cobra Blue Ghost 28, {{called a}} <b>Mayday</b> but {{was able to}} safely exit the area and landed his {{severely}} damaged helicopter. His aircraft was totaled. He and Gunner Warrant Officer Charles Gorski were {{picked up by a}} HH-53C helicopter (Jolly Green 67), without incident. Rosebeary warned other aircraft against crossing the river. When Morse in Sandy 07 learned that the quick-snatch had failed, he and his wingman Sandy 08 broke off engaging the North Vietnamese and returned to Da Nang. Both Sandys were found to be so damaged they would take several days to repair. At 9:00p.m., Nail 59, {{a new version of the}} OV-10A Bronco aircraft equipped with the Pave Nail LORAN radar piloted by Gary Ferentchak, took over FAC duties. The SAR efforts were suspended for the night and the U.S. and ARVN forces remained unaware of the true strength of the NVA offensive. Advised by the FAC to remain in place, Hambleton moved to a safer spot in the jungle and dug a hole to hide in until morning. During the night, Nail 59 and King 27, an HC-130 commanded by Maj. Dennis Constant, stayed. They suddenly found themselves painted by Fan Song radar and narrowly missed getting shot down as well. At 53 years old, Hambleton was not a prime candidate to survive the cold, wet weather conditions.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mayday's</b> early {{style of}} music was characterised by raw music {{production}} that tended towards Hokkien garage rock tunes. They were also vocal advocates {{on the issue}} of gay rights, with several songs making oblique references to the issue. As they gained popularity however, the band gradually shed its hard-edged sound and moved towards slicker production and sprawling anthemic songs.|$|R
50|$|Ashin {{used to be}} <b>Mayday's</b> sole composer; it {{was only}} during {{production}} of the band's fifth album that other band members began to contribute their own work. Ashin's compositional talents have been highly sought after by other artists {{and as a result}} he has composed a significant number of songs for other artists, such as: Fish Leong (梁静茹), Rene Liu (劉若英), S.H.E.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mayday's</b> {{songs are}} written mostly in Mandarin with some Taiwanese Hokkien tracks by Ashin, who speaks fluent Hokkien in {{addition}} to Mandarin. They are popular for their student band roots, and their ability in capturing the zeitgeist of Taiwanese youth {{in the mid to}} late 1990s. They are often cited as one of the pioneers of rock music in Taiwan.|$|R

5000|$|Older {{pieces and}} nursery rhymes are {{occasionally}} parodied. [...] "Don't Wanna Grow Up" [...] is {{a parody of}} Mozart's 40th Symphony, and [...] "London Bridge is Falling Down" [...] (...) {{is based on the}} children's song of the same name. The verses of [...] "Thanks for Your Gentleness" [...] (...) are original compositions, but the chorus is borrowed from <b>Mayday's</b> [...] "Gentle and Soft".|$|R
50|$|After his {{greatest}} success in 1980 with The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby for the Royal Shakespeare Company, {{an adaptation of}} Charles Dickens's novel Nicholas Nickleby, he resumed writing original plays which deal more overtly with political subjects. After the abandonment of the left {{by a number of}} public figures during the 1970s, <b>Maydays</b> (1983) deals with people's drift rightwards as they age.|$|R
50|$|Ashin {{was born}} into a family of four, {{consisting}} of his parents, himself, and a younger brother. His family owned a record store, which inspired his passion for music. Ashin's childhood ambition was to become a singer, but his vocal range was too narrow. He claims his bandmates selected him to be <b>Mayday's</b> singer as he was the worst instrumentalist out of all of them. Ashin can play both guitar and drums.|$|R
