40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{the details of the}} design of the optics being developed for the TA-EUSO and the EUSO-Balloon experiments. These are pathfinders experiments of the JEM-EUSO mission. TA-EUSO (Telescope Array EUSO) observes the fluorescence light from extensive air showers, generated by ultra high energy cosmic rays, detected at the Telescope Array site in Utah. The EUSO-Balloon will observe extensive air showers from a gondola of a stratospheric balloon. We have developed feasible optics designs for these experiments based on the JEM- EUSO optics development. These designs are simplified version of the JEM-EUSO baseline optics design. The optics of TA-EUSO consists of two 1 <b>m</b> <b>square</b> flat Fresnel PMMA lenses, while the EUSO-Balloon optics include, beside the two 1 <b>m</b> <b>square</b> flat Fresnel PMMA lenses, an additional 1 <b>m</b> <b>square</b> flat diffractive PMMA lens...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The TA-EUSO and EUSO-Balloon are the {{pathfinder}} experiments for the JEM-EUSO mission. The TA-EUSO observes fluorescence {{light from}} the cosmic ray air showers at the Telescope Array (TA) site with better resolution than the fluorescence detector of TA. The EUSO-Balloon is designed to observe extensive air shower from a stratospheric balloon. The optics team has developed the Bread Board Model (BBM) of the JEM-EUSO optics between 2007 and 2011. We have reached the fundamental technique of the meter scale fresnel lens manufacturing through the BBM lens manufacturing. The TA-EUSO optics consists of two 1 <b>m</b> <b>square</b> flat Fresnel lenses, built in UV grade Poly Methyl Meth-Acrylate (PMMA). The TA-EUSO lenses and the EUSO-Balloon middle lens have been manufactured successfully. The manufacturing of the EUSO-Balloon front lens and rear lens will be completed within summer 2013. The EUSO-Balloon optics consists of two 1 <b>m</b> <b>square</b> flat Fresnel PMMA lenses and of a 1 <b>m</b> <b>square</b> flat diffractive PMMA lens.
