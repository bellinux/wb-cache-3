5|$|Inertial {{confinement}} fusionis one of {{two major}} lines of fusion power development, the other being <b>magnetic</b> <b>confinement</b> fusion (MCF), notably the tokamak concept which is being built in a major experimental system known as ITER. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>confinement</b> is widely {{considered to be the}} superior approach, and has seen significantly greater development activity over the decades. However, there are serious concerns that the MCF approach of ITER cannot ever become economically practical.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, a {{group of}} {{materials}} scientists reported that they have successfully generated stable impermeable plasma with no <b>magnetic</b> <b>confinement</b> using only an ultrahigh-pressure blanket of cold gas. While spectroscopic data {{on the characteristics of}} plasma were claimed to be difficult to obtain due to the high pressure, the passive effect of plasma on synthesis of different nanostructures clearly suggested the effective confinement. They also showed that upon maintaining the impermeability for a few tens of seconds, screening of ions at the plasma-gas interface could give rise to a strong secondary mode of heating (known as viscous heating) leading to different kinetics of reactions and formation of complex nanomaterials.|$|E

25|$|A May 2010 paper {{discussed}} a small device's ability to capture electrons. The paper posited that the machine had an ideal magnetic field strength that maximized {{its ability to}} catch electrons. The paper analyzed <b>magnetic</b> <b>confinement</b> in the polywell using analytical solutions and simulations. The work linked the <b>magnetic</b> <b>confinement</b> in the polywell to magnetic mirror theory. The 2011 work used Particle-in-cell simulations to model particle motion in polywells with a small electron population. Electrons behaved {{in a similar manner}} to particles in the biconic cusp.|$|E
25|$|Over {{his career}} Conn has {{conducted}} studies on designs for several {{different approaches to}} creating and confining high temperature fusion plasmas for energy production, among them <b>magnetic</b> <b>confinement</b> reactors, inertial confinement (sometimes called “laser fusion”) reactors, and nuclear fusion-fission hybrid reactors.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{ballistic}} edge-channel transport in quantum wires with a magnetic quantum dot, which is formed by two different magnetic fields B^* and B_ 0 {{inside and outside}} the dot, respectively. We find that the electron states located near the dot and the scattering of edge channels by the dot strongly depend on whether B^* is parallel or antiparallel to B_ 0. For parallel fields, two-terminal conductance as a function of channel energy is quantized except for resonances, while, for antiparallel fields, it is not quantized and all channels can be completely reflected in some energy ranges. All these features are attributed to the characteristic <b>magnetic</b> <b>confinements</b> caused by nonuniform fields. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figures, to be published in Physical Review Letter...|$|R

It is the largest stellarator (torsatron) in Europe.|$|R
25|$|In ITER {{and many}} other <b>magnetic</b> <b>confinement</b> reactors, the plasma, a gas of charged particles, is {{confined}} using magnetic fields. A charged particle moving through a magnetic field experiences a force perpendicular to the direction of travel, resulting in centripetal acceleration, thereby confining it to move in a circle or helix around the lines of magnetic flux.|$|E
25|$|Tritium is an {{important}} fuel for controlled nuclear fusion in both <b>magnetic</b> <b>confinement</b> and inertial confinement fusion reactor designs. The experimental fusion reactor ITER and the National Ignition Facility (NIF) will use deuterium-tritium fuel. The deuterium-tritium reaction is favorable since it has the largest fusion cross-section (about 5.0barns) and it reaches this maximum cross-section at the lowest energy (about 65keV center-of-mass) of any potential fusion fuel.|$|E
25|$|Research into using fusion for the {{production}} of electricity, has been pursued for over 60 years. Successful accomplishment of controlled fusion has been stymied by scientific and technological difficulties; nonetheless, important progress has been made. At present, controlled fusion reactions have been unable to produce break-even (self-sustaining) controlled fusion. The two most advanced approaches are <b>magnetic</b> <b>confinement</b> (toroid designs) and inertial confinement (laser designs).|$|E
40|$|It is shown, using {{results of}} {{measurements}} of ion saturation current in the plasma edges of different <b>magnetic</b> fusion <b>confinement</b> devices (tokamaks and stellarators), that the plasma dynamics in the edges is dominated by distributed chaos with spontaneously broken translational symmetry at low magnetic field, and with spontaneously broken reflexional symmetry (by helical solitons) at high magnetic field...|$|R

40|$|Ultracold {{neutrons}} (UCN) {{have very}} low kinetic energies 0 - 300 neV, thereby {{can be stored}} in specific material or <b>magnetic</b> <b>confinements</b> for many hundreds of seconds. This makes them a very useful tool in probing fundamental symmetries of nature (for instance charge-parity violation by neutron electric dipole moment experiments) and contributing important parameters for the Big Bang nucleosynthesis (neutron lifetime measurements). Improved precision experiments are in construction at new and planned UCN sources around the world. MC simulations {{play an important role in}} the optimization of such systems with a large number of parameters, but also in the estimation of systematic effects, in benchmarking of analysis codes, or as part of the analysis. The MCUCN code written at PSI has been extensively used for the optimization of the UCN source optics and in the optimization and analysis of (test) experiments within the nEDM project based at PSI. In this paper we present the main features of MCUCN and interesting benchmark and application examples...|$|R
25|$|Magnetic Loops Another {{example of}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>confinement</b> is {{to bend the}} field lines back on themselves, either in circles or more {{commonly}} in nested toroidal surfaces. The most highly developed system of this type is the tokamak, with the stellarator being next most advanced, followed by the Reversed field pinch. Compact toroids, especially the Field-Reversed Configuration and the spheromak, attempt to combine the advantages of toroidal magnetic surfaces with those of a simply connected (non-toroidal) machine, resulting in a mechanically simpler and smaller confinement area.|$|E
25|$|Coronal stars, or stars {{within a}} coronal cloud, are {{ubiquitous}} {{among the stars}} in the cool half of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Experiments with instruments aboard Skylab and Copernicus have been used to search for soft X-ray emission in the energy range ~0.14–0.284 keV from stellar coronae. The experiments aboard ANS succeeded in finding X-ray signals from Capella and Sirius (α CMa). X-ray emission from an enhanced solar-like corona was proposed for the first time. The high temperature of Capella's corona as obtained from the first coronal X-ray spectrum of Capella using HEAO 1 required <b>magnetic</b> <b>confinement</b> unless it was a free-flowing coronal wind.|$|E
25|$|Activation {{energies}} for fusion {{reactions are}} generally high because the protons in each nucleus {{will tend to}} strongly repel one another, as they each have the same positive charge. A heuristic for estimating reaction rates is that nuclei {{must be able to}} get within 100 femtometers (1 × 10−13 meter) of each other, where the nuclei are increasingly likely to undergo quantum tunneling past the electrostatic barrier and the turning point where the strong nuclear force and the electrostatic force are equally balanced, allowing them to fuse. In ITER, this distance of approach is made possible by high temperatures and <b>magnetic</b> <b>confinement.</b>|$|E
40|$|The strain induced pseudo-magnetic {{field in}} {{supported}} graphene deposited {{on top of}} a nanostructured substrate is investigated by using atomistic simulations. Step, elongated trench, one dimensional barrier, spherical bubbles, Gaussian bump and Gaussian depression are considered as support structures for graphene. From the obtained optimum configurations we found very strong induced pseudo-magnetic fields which can reach up to ∼ 1000 T due to the strain-induced deformations in the supported graphene. Different <b>magnetic</b> <b>confinements</b> with controllable geometries are found by tuning the pattern of the substrate. The resulting induced magnetic fields for graphene {{on top of a}} step, barrier and trench are calculated. In contrast to the step and trench the middle part of graphene on top of a barrier has zero pseudo-magnetic field. This study provides a theoretical background for designing magnetic structures in graphene by nanostructuring substrates. We found that altering the radial symmetry of the deformation, changes the six-fold symmetry of the induced pseudo-magnetic field. Comment: 7 pages, 9 figures, To appear in Phys. Rev. ...|$|R

25|$|Since these {{reactions}} {{involve the}} reactants and {{products of the}} primary fusion reaction, {{it would be difficult}} to further lower the neutron production by a significant fraction. A clever <b>magnetic</b> <b>confinement</b> scheme could in principle suppress the first reaction by extracting the alphas as soon as they are created, but then their energy would not be available to keep the plasma hot. The second reaction could in principle be suppressed relative to the desired fusion by removing the high energy tail of the ion distribution, but this would probably be prohibited by the power required to prevent the distribution from thermalizing.|$|E
25|$|Construction of the ITER Tokamak complex {{started in}} 2013 and the {{building}} costs are now over US$14 billion as of June 2015. The facility is expected to finish its construction phase in 2021 and will start commissioning the reactor that same year and initiate plasma experiments in 2025 with full deuterium–tritium fusion experiments starting in 2035. If ITER becomes operational, it will become the largest <b>magnetic</b> <b>confinement</b> plasma physics experiment in use with a plasma volume of 840 cubic meters, surpassing the Joint European Torus by almost a factor of 10. The first commercial demonstration fusion power station, named DEMO, is proposed to follow on from the ITER project.|$|E
25|$|Magnetic Mirror One {{example of}} <b>{{magnetic}}</b> <b>confinement</b> {{is with the}} magnetic mirror effect. If a particle follows the field line and enters a region of higher field strength, the particles can be reflected. There are several devices that try to use this effect. The most famous was the magnetic mirror machines, which {{was a series of}} large, expensive devices built at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory from the 1960s to mid 1980s. Some other examples include the magnetic bottles and Biconic cusp. Because the mirror machines were straight, they had some advantages over a ring shape. First, mirrors were easier to construct and maintain and second direct conversion energy capture, was easier to implement. As the confinement achieved in experiments was poor, this approach was abandoned.|$|E

50|$|Schematically, the RFX-Mod {{machine is}} similar to a tokamak system. Both designs contain a {{toroidal}} vessel containing ionized particles under a strong <b>confinement</b> <b>magnetic</b> field coupled to a coaxial transformer whose secondary coil conducts the plasma toroidal current.|$|R
25|$|In <b>magnetic</b> <b>confinement</b> reactors, {{hydrogen}} gas (usually a 50-50 mixture of two heavier isotopes of ordinary hydrogen, namely deuterium and tritium) is heated to very high temperatures (about 150 million degrees Celsius). At these high temperatures electrons separate from hydrogen nuclei {{and the gas}} becomes plasma, which {{is often referred to}} as the fourth state of matter, the others being solid, liquid and gas. By controlling, or confining, the flow of plasma in test reactors, engineers can cause hydrogen nuclei to collide and fuse – creating for short amounts of time a nuclear fusion reaction that generates heat. One of the unsolved challenges of controlled nuclear fusion energy is to sustain a reaction that generates more energy than what goes into just maintaining the operation of the reactor plasma itself.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{the main}} line of {{research}} via tokamaks has been developed {{to the point that}} it is now possible to undertake the penultimate step in <b>magnetic</b> <b>confinement</b> plasma physics research with a self-sustained reaction. In the tokamak research program, recent advances devoted to controlling the configuration of the plasma have led to the achievement of substantially improved energy and pressure confinement, which reduces the projected cost of electricity from such reactors by a factor of two to a value only about 50% more than the projected cost of electricity from advanced light-water reactors. In addition, progress in the development of advanced, low activation structural materials supports the promise of environmentally benign fusion reactors and research into alternate confinement concepts is yielding the promise of future improvements in confinement. Finally, supporters contend that other potential replacements to the fossil fuels have environmental issues of their own. Solar, wind, and hydroelectric power all have a relatively low power output per square kilometer compared to ITER's successor DEMO which, at 2,000 MW, would have an energy density that exceeds even large fission power stations.|$|E
25|$|The {{reality is}} not so clear-cut. The most {{advanced}} fusion programs {{in the world are}} inertial confinement fusion (such as National Ignition Facility) and <b>magnetic</b> <b>confinement</b> fusion (such as ITER and other tokamaks). In the case of the former, there is no solid roadmap to power generation. In the case of the latter, commercial power generation is not expected until around 2050. In both cases, the type of fusion discussed is the simplest: D-T fusion. The reason for this is the very low Coulomb barrier for this reaction; for D+3He, the barrier is much higher, and it is even higher for 3He–3He. The immense cost of reactors like ITER and National Ignition Facility are largely due to their immense size, yet to scale up to higher plasma temperatures would require reactors far larger still. The 14.7 MeV proton and 3.6 MeV alpha particle from D–3He fusion, plus the higher conversion efficiency, means that more electricity is obtained per kilogram than with D-T fusion (17.6 MeV), but not that much more. As a further downside, the rates of reaction for helium-3 fusion reactions are not particularly high, requiring a reactor that is larger still or more reactors to produce the same amount of electricity.|$|E
