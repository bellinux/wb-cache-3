40|$|Article 13 of the Framework Convention on Climate Change(FCCC) (UN, 1992) {{permits the}} {{establishment}} of a <b>Multilateral</b> <b>Consultative</b> <b>Process</b> for the resolution of questions regarding implementation of the Convention. The process for resolving the disputes, challenges, and complications that will arise during and from implementation of the Convention have been addressed throughout the Convention's negotiations, but agreement of the need for, and the exact form of, a <b>Multilateral</b> <b>Consultative</b> <b>Process</b> has been elusive. Implementation remains a serious challenge to the overall effectiveness of the Convention: although the Convention has initiated broad and in-depth reviews of national implementation, there is still a need for a system that can respond to particular questions about implementation. The essay examines possible elements of an Article 13 Process and suggests answers to important design questions that will arise during its creation and maintenance. It traces the consequences of different design choices for the operation of the Process- for example, the role "standing" rules play in shaping participation in the Process, and the roles expert support staff and decision-making timetables play in improving its effectiveness. The essay also examines potential relationships between an Article 13 Process and the other procedures and bodies established under the Convention. The intended audience is primarily the legal and technical experts who will be responsible for suggesting the initial design of the Article 13 Process, as well as a wider group of scholars and practitioners who are generally interested in the options for designing effective international procedures for reviewing implementation of the Convention. ...|$|E
40|$|In this essay, {{the author}} assesses the {{operation}} of the Non-Compliance Procedure of the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer. Although in operation for only six years, the Procedure and its standing Implementation Committee have already made significant contributions to the effectiveness of the Montreal Protocol. The Implementation Committee serves as a forum for discussing compliance-related issues; it has {{played a central role in}} managing individual cases of compliance. The author applies some lessons from the Montreal Protocol experience to the design of noncompliance procedures and similar mechanisms in other multilateral environmental agreements. He focuses on the <b>Multilateral</b> <b>Consultative</b> <b>Process</b> (Article 13) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. ...|$|E
40|$|In this essay, {{the author}} reviews and assesses efforts within the International Labor Organization (ILO) to {{supervise}} national implementation of international labor standards. Today, ILO supervision includes an active system of regular reviews {{as well as}} several special procedures that can be invoked on an ad hoc basis to handle particular problems of noncompliance when they arise. Developed over 70 years, it is the most elaborate and active multilateral compliance supervision system in international law. The author applies lessons from the ILO experience to the design of possible multilateral supervision systems within environmental agreements. He focuses in particular on the <b>Multilateral</b> <b>Consultative</b> <b>Process</b> (Article 13) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. ...|$|E
40|$|Why {{the move}} to {{universal}} access when we havent́ yet met the 3 by 5 target ? What does universal access actually mean? Does this new focus on universal access offer an opportunity for advocacy for equity? The onus is for countries to define – through <b>consultative</b> <b>processes</b> – what ‘universaláccess means, rather than working to global targets and putting together plans and processes to meet universal access. The theory is that these country <b>consultative</b> <b>processes</b> will feed into regional <b>consultative</b> <b>processes,</b> which for southern and eastern Africa {{will be held in}} Zimbabwe from 7 - 10 March, 2006.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a straightforward and highly participatory methodology for addressing government agencies' concerns with effective communication strategies for biosecurity when stakeholders are diverse {{and there is}} uncertainty about their levels of knowledge. The case study was among peri-urban landholders {{in an area where}} serious animal disease infestation has occurred within the last 10 years. Initially we engaged stakeholders in a <b>consultative</b> <b>process</b> that included establishing a stakeholder influence and interest map for both weeds and animal diseases. This was followed with a mental model approach involving surveys and in-depth interviews. We elicited information about landholders' knowledge, practices, values and beliefs regarding biosecurity risk. Our <b>consultative</b> <b>process</b> generated examples that indicate that effective risk communication relies on establishing and affirming mutual levels of trust and credibility between landholders and agencies. While this finding is not surprising, we argue that attention to stakeholder <b>consultative</b> <b>processes</b> is central to overcoming barriers to changing practices and building awareness. Secondly, our data confirmed that while smaller landholders were the initial target for the communication, all landholders represented a similar level of biosecurity risk. Therefore, our approach was critical in overcoming external assumptions about particular actors. Finally, our data pointed to the need to develop a whole of landscape approach to biosecurity risk communication strategy in consultation with local stakeholders. © 2011 Taylor & Francis...|$|R
