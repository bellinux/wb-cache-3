The electric power of the inner sources in the enclosure is considered on the bases of the electric vector potential. The results lead to a new conception {{with respect to the}} energy conversions. They are due to the {{energy exchange}} between magnetic contours by the way of the mutual electric field. The self and the mutual electromagnetic parameters of the magnetic contours are defined: self and <b>mutual</b> electric <b>conductance,</b> self and <b>mutual</b> capacitance. The parameters are closely related with the self and the mutual magnetic flux and with the self and the mutual electric energy of non-conservative electric field.

[...] This is often exploited in R.F. amplifiers where an alteration of the grid bias changes the <b>mutual</b> <b>conductance</b> and hence the gain of the device.

Often, but not always, in the European valve naming scheme for pentodes an even number indicated a sharp-cutoff device while odd indicated remote-cutoff; the EF37 was an exception to this general trend, perhaps due to its history as an update to the EF36 ("The Mullard EF36, EF37 and EF37A" [...] at the National Valve Museum).|$|E
40|$|There {{are several}} metrics (Modularity, <b>Mutual</b> Information, <b>Conductance,</b> etc.) to {{evaluate}} the strength of graph clustering in large graphs. These metrics have great significance to measure the effectiveness and they are often used to find the strongly connected clusters {{with respect to the}} whole graph. In this paper, we propose a new metric {{to evaluate the}} strength of graph clustering and also study its applications. We show that our proposed metric has great consistency which is similar to other metrics and easy to calculate. Our proposed metric also shows consistency where other metrics fail in some special cases. We demonstrate that our metric has reasonable strength while extracting strongly connected communities in both simulated (in silico) data and real data networks. We also show some comparative results of our proposed metric with other popular metric(s) for Online Social Networks (OSN) and Gene Regulatory Networks (GRN).

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{intercellular}} coupling conductance on {{the activity of}} two electrically coupled isolated rabbit sinoatrial nodal cells were investigated. A computer-controlled version of the "coupling clamp" technique was used in which isolated sinoatrial nodal cells, not physically in contact with each other, were electrically coupled at various values of ohmic coupling conductance, mimicking the effects of mutual interaction by electrical coupling through gap junctional channels. We demonstrate the existence of four types of electrical behavior of coupled spontaneously active cells. As the coupling conductance is progressively increased, the cells exhibit: (a) independent pacemaking at low coupling conductances, (b) complex dynamics of activity with mutual interactions, (c) entrainment of action potential frequency at a 1 : 1 ratio with different action potential waveforms, and (d) entrainment of action potentials at the same frequency of activation and virtually identical action potential waveforms. The critical value of coupling conductance required for 1 : 1 frequency entrainment was < 0. 5 nS {{in each of the}} five cell pairs studied. The common interbeat interval at a relatively high coupling conductance (10 nS), which is sufficient to produce entrainment of frequency and also identical action potential waveforms, is determined most by the intrinsically faster pacemaker cell and it can be predicted from the diastolic depolarization times of both cells. Evidence is provided that, at low coupling <b>conductances,</b> <b>mutual</b> pacemaker synchronization results mainly from the phase-resetting effects of the action potential of one cell on the depolarization phase of the other. At high coupling conductances, the tonic, diastolic interactions become more importan...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{influence}} of crosstalk on single victim due to multiple aggressors in the same metal layer is studied. We develop here a crosstalk fault model based on the consideration of usual distributed coupling capacitance and RLGC parasitics of interconnects in addition to <b>mutual</b> <b>conductance</b> (resistive bridging) {{in order to deal}} the crosstalk influence. Here, we estimate the crosstalk influence for worst case input signal combinations on aggressors, which induce more crosstalk on single victim. Our model helps the System-on-Chip (SoC) designers by providing sufficient insights into Signal Integrity problems. Experimental simulations with our crosstalk model, carried out using Philips CMOS 12 (130 nm) technology parameters, further validated with PSPICE simulations reveal that coupling capacitance’s effect is more on crosstalk glitch and signal delay on victim’s output whereas, the <b>mutual</b> <b>conductance</b> affects more on the final steady state value of the victim’s output signal.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the properties and potential applications {{of a novel}} hybrid varistor device originating from biased voltage induced modified nonlinear current-voltage (I-V) characteristics. Single crystal of an oxide semiconductor in the family of iron-titanates with the chemical formula of Fe 2 TiO 5 (pseudobrookite) {{has been used as}} substrate for the varistor. The modifications of the varistor characteristics are achieved by superimposition of a bias voltage in the current path of the varistor. These altered I-V characteristics, when analyzed, reveal the existence of embedded transistors coexisting with the varistor. These transistors exhibit <b>mutual</b> <b>conductance,</b> signal amplification and electronic switching which are the defining signatures of a typical transistor.

40|$|In {{the era of}} deep {{submicron}} technology (DSM), many System-on-Chip (SoC) applications require the components to be operating at high clock speeds. With the shrinking feature size and ever increasing clock frequencies, the DSM technology {{has led to a}} well-known problem of Signal Integrity (SI) more especially in the connecting layout design. The increasing aspect ratios of metal wires and also the ratio of coupling capacitance over substrate capacitance result in electrical coupling of interconnects which leads to crosstalk problems. In this thesis, first the work carried out to model the crosstalk behaviour between aggressor and victim by considering the distributed RLGC parameters of interconnect and the coupling capacitance and <b>mutual</b> <b>conductance</b> between the two nets is presented. The proposed model also considers the RC linear models of the CMOS drivers and receivers. The behaviour of crosstalk in case of under etching problem has been studied and modelled by distributing and approximating the defect behaviour throughout the nets. Next, the proposed model has also been extended to model the behaviour of crosstalk in case of one victim is influenced by several aggressors by considering all aggressors have similar effect (worst-case) on victim. In all the above cases simulation experiments were also carried out and compared with well-known circuit simulation tool PSPICE. It has been proved that the generated crosstalk model is faster and the results generated are within 10 % of error margin compared to latter simulation tool. Because of the accuracy and speed of the proposed model, the model is very useful for both SoC designers and test engineers to analyse the crosstalk behaviour. Each manufactured device needs to be tested thoroughly to ensure the functionality before its delivery. The test pattern generation for crosstalk faults is also necessary to test the corresponding crosstalk faults. In this thesis, the well-known PODEM algorithm for stuck-at faults is extended to generate the test patterns for crosstalk faults between single aggressor and single victim. To apply modified PODEM for crosstalk faults, the transition behaviour has been divided into two logic parts as before transition and after transition. After finding individually required test patterns for before transition and after transition, the generated logic vectors are appended to create transition test patterns for crosstalk faults. The developed algorithm is also applied for a few ISCAS 85 benchmark circuits and the fault coverage is found excellent in most circuits. With the incorporation of proposed algorithm into the ATPG tools, the efficiency of testing will be improved by generating the test patterns for crosstalk faults besides for the conventional stuck-at faults. In generating test patterns for crosstalk faults on single victim due to multiple aggressors, the modified PODEM algorithm is found to be more time consuming. The search capability of Genetic Algorithms in finding the required combination of several input factors for any optimized problem fascinated to apply GA for generating test patterns as generating the test pattern is also similar to finding the required vector out of several input transitions. Initially the GA is applied for generating test patterns for stuck-at faults and compared the results with PODEM algorithm. As the fault coverage is almost similar to the deterministic algorithm PODEM, the GA developed for stuck-at faults is extended to find test patterns for crosstalk faults between single aggressor and single victim. The elitist GA is also applied for a few ISCAS 85 benchmark circuits. Later the algorithm is extended to generate test patterns for worst-case crosstalk faults. It has been proved that elitist GA developed in this thesis is also very useful in generating test patterns for crosstalk faults especially for multiple aggressor and single victim crosstalk faults...|$|E
