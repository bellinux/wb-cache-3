50|$|In {{the hours}} {{following}} {{the arrival of}} Multon in Lyon, the two men set up a Gestapo team in Ms. Dumoulin's lodge. She was arrested and her mailbox put under surveillance.

This especially allowed the KDS Lyon to intercept an unencrypted messages that Henri Aubry asked his secretary, Ms. Raisin, to deposit in the mailbox of 14 rue Bouteille. The message, written in clear text, was intended for Ren√© Hardy, alias Didot, to prevent a meeting on June 9 at 9 am with General Delestraint at the entrance of the metro station La Muette in Paris. The KDS Lyon obviously intercepted the message and immediately alerted the German authorities of Paris. On the other hand, Aubry forgot to prevent Delestraint and Hardy when he found out that the mailbox was compromised since the liaisons Combat broadcast information from the arrest of Mary Reynoard.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The present {{case study}} reports {{a case of}} chronic cough and cough syncope {{associated}} with frequent premature ventricular complexes (PVCs). Careful analysis of cough-related symptoms and ECG <b>monitoring</b> <b>led</b> to the suspicion of PVC-induced cough. A coincidence between PVCs and episodes of cough was also documented by a portable multichannel recorder. Moreover, Doppler echocardiography revealed a PVC-induced transient increase in the pulmonary artery blood flow. After exclusion of other possible aetiologies, complete relief of chronic cough and cough syncope was achieved by radiofrequency ablation of the arrhythmogenic focus located in the right ventricular outflow tract. Premature ventricular complexes {{should be considered as}} a cause of chronic cough and cough syncope and an interdisciplinary cooperation can lead to successful diagnosis and treatment of this condition...|$|E

First, commercialisation raised wages as a growing reliance on impersonal labour market transactions in place of customary relations with a high degree of <b>monitoring</b> <b>led</b> to the adoption of efficiency wages. Second, commercialisation lowered interest rates as a growing reliance on impersonal capital market transactions in place of active investor involvement in investment projects led investors to allow borrowers to keep a larger share of the profits.

Fourth, this led to a faster rate of technological progress through greater learning by doing on the capital intensive production technology.

Yet despite their ubiquity and widespread importance for humans, we know very little of ritual‚Äôs causal basis and how (if at all) they facilitate goal-directed performance.

40|$|When food becomes scarce, the {{youngest}} nestlings in facultatively siblicidal raptor species typically die and such events are usually attributed to siblicide. Here we present results from an {{investigation in the}} Arctic tundra, in which rough-legged buzzard (Buteo lagopus) breeding success was monitored with regular visits to nests and time-lapse cameras that continuously recorded the activity of chicks and their parents. The study {{took place in the}} Nenetsky Nature Reserve (68 &#x 00 B 0; 20 &#x 2032;N, 53 &#x 00 B 0; 18 &#x 2032;E) in the Russian Arctic, in 2007 10.

Camera monitoring also led us to discover how a sequence of abrupt weather shifts, between hot and sunny conditions and heavy rain, probably caused the death of nestlings in two nests.

40|$|Background: Patients with {{significant}} bilateral carotid artery stenosis requiring urgent cardiac surgery {{have an increased}} risk of stroke and death. The optimal management strategy remains inconclusive, and the available evidence does not support the superiority of one strategy over another. Materials and Methods: A number of noninvasive strategies have been developed for minimizing perioperative stroke including continuous real-time monitoring of cerebral oxygenation with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The number of patients presenting with this combination (bilateral significant carotid stenosis requiring urgent cardiac surgery) in any single institution will be small and hence {{there is a lack of}} large randomized studies. Results: This case series describes our early experience with NIRS in a select group of patients {{with significant}} bilateral carotid stenosis undergoing urgent cardiac surgery (n = 8). In contrast to other studies, this series is a single surgeon, single center study, where the entire surgery (both distal ends and proximal ends) was performed during single aortic clamp technique, which effectively removes several confounding variables. NIRS <b>monitoring</b> <b>led</b> to the early recognition of decreased cerebral oxygenation, and corrective steps (increased cardiopulmonary bypass flow, increased pCO 2, etc.,) were taken. Conclusion: The study shows good clinical outcome with the use of NIRS. This is our "work in progress," and we aim to conduct a larger study...|$|E
40|$|The {{improvement}} {{and performance of}} a micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography assay for cefepime in human serum and plasma with a 50 Œºm id fused-silica capillary elongated from 40 to 60 cm is reported. Sample preparation with dodecylsulfate protein precipitation at pH 4. 5, the pH 9. 1 separation medium and the applied voltage were as reported previously[16]. The change resulted in a significant lower current, higher resolution and increased detection time intervals. The performance of the assay with multi-level internal calibration was assessed with calibration and control samples. Quality assurance data of a two year period assessed under the new conditions demonstrated the robustness of the assay. In serum samples of patients who received both cefepime and sulfamethoxazole, cefepime could not be detected due to the inseparability of the two compounds. The presence of an interference can be recognized by an increased peak width (width > 0. 2 min), {{the appearance of a}} shoulder or an unresolved double peak. The patient data gathered during a three year period reveal that introduction of therapeutic drug <b>monitoring</b> <b>led</b> to a 50 % reduction of the median drug level.

30|$|The {{results of}} this {{cross-sectional}} study reflect how hemodynamic monitoring is performed in reality in ICUs in the three European countries Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. In fact, all patients were monitored with basic hemodynamic monitoring consisting of ECG, blood pressure measurements, and pulse oximetry. Also the majority of patients received invasive arterial and central venous catheterization. Extended hemodynamic monitoring, and in particular monitoring of cardiac output, although widely available, was performed all over in less than 15 ¬†%. Mechanical ventilation, treatment backed by protocols, {{and the need for}} catecholamine therapy were the factors independently {{associated with the use of}} advanced hemodynamic monitoring. This was also validated in subgroup analyses of patients treated by mechanical ventilation or vasoactive agents. The most frequently used method for preload monitoring was the assessment of filling pressures. The use of volumetric or dynamic parameters of preload was rare. In 71.6 ¬†% of patients, in whom extended hemodynamic monitoring was added during the study period, this addition of <b>monitoring</b> <b>led</b> to direct changes in treatment. The vast majority of ICUs reported that protocols for hemodynamic treatment were available, and in nearly 60 ¬†% of patients, hemodynamic management was reported to be performed according to an implemented treatment protocol.

Whether quality of cardiovascular treatment was influenced by the use of specific treatment protocols cannot be assessed on the basis of the present data.|$|E
