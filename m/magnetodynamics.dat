40|$|Abstract. The idea of {{establishing}} coherent relaxation in an assembly of magnetic moments by {{placing it in}} a passive resonator [1, 2] {{is applied to the}} case of single-domain ferromagnetic nanoparticles. The <b>magnetodynamics</b> of a particle is governed by the Landau-Lifshitz equation modified by adding the resonator feedback field. The particle uniaxial magnetic anisotropy and the interparticle dipole-dipole interactions are taken into account. We consider an assembly of single-domain ferromagnetic nanoparticles maintained at a temperature that is sufficiently low, so that superparamagnetic effects could be neglected. The particles magnetic moments are initially aligned and then a constant magnetic field H 0 in an opposite direction is applied compelling the system to invert its magnetization. Therefore, the <b>magnetodynamics</b> of the system starts from a strongly non-equilibrium state tending to a complete inversion of the magnetization. The particle assembly is placed into a resonator, which we model by an LCR circuit. As soon as the relaxation motion of the magnetic moments sets out, it induces in the coil (L) an electromotive force, which, in turn, generates an AC current in the circuit. The magnetic field of this current acts on the magnetic moments of the particles thus modifying their individual relaxation behavior. The <b>magnetodynamics</b> of the particle assembly is described by the standard Landau-Lifshitz equation, for k-th particle, i. e., for the magnetic moment () kµ one ha...|$|E

40|$|Magnetization {{dynamics}} in thin film ferromagnets {{can be studied}} using a dispersive hydrodynamic formulation. The equations describing the <b>magnetodynamics</b> map to a compressible fluid with broken Galilean invariance parametrized by the longitudinal spin density and a magnetic analog of the fluid velocity that define spindensity waves. A direct consequence of these equations is the determination of a magnetic Mach number. Micromagnetic simulations reveal nucleation of nonlinear structures from an impenetrable object realized by an applied magnetic field spot or a defect. In this work, micromagnetic simulations demonstrate vortex-antivortex pair nucleation from an obstacle. Their interaction establishes either ordered or irregular vortex-antivortex complexes. Furthermore, when the magnetic Mach number exceeds unity (supersonic flow), a Mach cone and periodic wavefronts are observed, which can be well-described by solutions of the steady, linearized equations. These results are reminiscent of theoretical and experimental observations in Bose-Einstein condensates, and further support the analogy between the <b>magnetodynamics</b> of a thin film ferromagnet and compressible fluids.

40|$|Exploring {{ultimate}} {{time scales}} of magnetic switching processes {{is an important}} issue in spin electronics. In spin valves or magnetic tunnelling junctions magnetic anisotropies and coupling phenomena alter the magnetodynamic response of the entire system. Understanding the role of these interactions is a key to the design of optimized devices. We have employed time-resolved X-ray photoemission microscopy to address the <b>magnetodynamics</b> in spin-valve-type model systems in the ns- and ps-regime. In Co/Cr/Fe(0 0 1) single crystal elements we find a strong influence of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy, which tends to suppress rotation processes. In addition, we observe a dynamic “decoupling” of the layers. In low-anisotropy FeNi/Cr/FeCo trilayers, the interlayer coupling character determines the dynamic response. Particularly, rotational processes in the FeNi and FeCo layers are temporarily shifted to each other, which can be related to different coercivities of the individual layers. By contrast, the domain wall motion in both layers closely agrees, caused by an enhanced coupling due to the domain wall stray fields. Our examples demonstrate that the detailed <b>magnetodynamics</b> in coupled magnetic layers is quite complex and depends strongly on the timescale under consideration...|$|E
