40|$|<b>Moulting</b> is a {{biological}} condition {{that can happen}} in poultry. It is resulted from the complex interaction which involves the function of thyroxine hormone. <b>Moulting</b> can reduce or even stop the egg production. A {{study was conducted to}} observe the <b>moulting</b> patterns of local ducks (Alabio and Mojosari) and to determine the relation of <b>moulting</b> with blood lipids (triglycerides), egg production and quality. Each breed consisted of ten female dukcs were observed for <b>moulting</b> pattern, blood triglycerides, egg production and quality. Fourty ducks were used for simulation of egg production. Data from <b>moulting</b> patterns,egg production and quality were analyzed using t-based on Least Square means with Statistical Analysis System. The relation of breeds and <b>moulting</b> patterns with triglycerides were analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for a completely randomized design in a factorial arrangement of 2 x 2. The main factor was kind of breeds, while the subfactor was the period of <b>moulting,</b> before and during <b>moulting.</b> There were not interaction in every variables between both factors. The average <b>moulting</b> periode of Alabio was significantly (P< 0. 05) shorter than that of Mojosari (69 vs 76 days). There were 40 % of Alabio ducks <b>moulting</b> for 61 - 70 days, while 40 % of Mojosari ducks <b>moulting</b> for 71 - 80 days. Egg production of Alabio ducks before and after <b>moulting</b> were higher than those Mojosari ducks. The triglycerides content of Alabio and Mojosari ducks was decreased during <b>moulting,</b> in Alabio ducks they were 32. 02 and 27. 64 μg/ml before and during <b>moulting,</b> while in Mojosari ducks they were 32. 83 and 29. 32 μg/ml respectively. Egg weight, albumin weight, yolk weight, and haugh unit of the two breeds increased after <b>moulting,</b> while yolk colour decreased.

40|$|Newly {{recruited}} early juveniles of {{the shore}} crab Carcinus maenas in North Wales are most abundant {{on the high}} intertidal of gravelly shores and, unlike adults, they do not undertake up-and-down shore migration with tides. Freshly collected first and second instar juvenile crabs showed persistent circatidal rhythms of <b>moulting</b> when maintained in constant laboratory conditions. Peaks of <b>moulting</b> occurred around expected times of high tides, with few crabs <b>moulting</b> at other times. The circatidal <b>moulting</b> patterns were similar in crabs collected {{at different stages of}} the neap-spring cycle. Daily monitoring of <b>moulting</b> in the laboratory of 23 batches of early crabs, collected from the high intertidal at 1 to 3 d intervals over 2 spring-neap cycles, further showed a marked circasemilunar <b>moulting</b> pattern superimposed on the tidal <b>moulting</b> rhythms. Significantly more crabs <b>moulted</b> within 24 h after collection when collected during spring tides than when collected at neaps. Moreover, the daily percentage <b>moulting</b> of the crabs on consecutive days after collection clearly followed the trend of predicted tidal height changes. Crabs collected on days of increasing tidal amplitude showed increasing <b>moulting</b> rates on the days after collection, whilst a decreasing trend of daily <b>moulting</b> rate was found if they were collected on days of decreasing tidal amplitude. For crabs collected at minimum neaps, when water did not reach the high intertidal even at high tides, virtually no <b>moulting</b> took place on the following days. <b>Moulting</b> at high tide, particularly during spring high tides, appears to be an adaptation to a high intertidal habitat which is only inundated at certain times during semilunar and tidal cycles. For C. maenas early juveniles, which remain in the high intertidal even when tides recede, anticipation of the rising and falling of tides through endogenous physiological programming to avoid ecdysis at the time exposed to air has clear adaptive value. The coupling of circatidal and circasemilunar <b>moulting</b> rhythms, and their endogenous control, reported in the present study appears to be the first demonstration of such a phenomenon in a crustacean...|$|R
5|$|Adult great spotted {{woodpeckers}} have {{a complete}} <b>moult</b> after the breeding season which takes about 120days. Northern D. m. major starts its <b>moult</b> from mid-June to late July and finishes in October or November, temperate races like D. m. pinetorum are earlier, commencing in early June to mid-July and completing in mid-September to late October, and southern D. m. hispanicus starts late May or June and finishes as early as August. Juveniles have a partial <b>moult,</b> retaining some of the wing coverts but replacing body, tail and primary feathers.

5|$|Juveniles <b>moult</b> their head, {{body and}} some wing {{feathers}} {{a few weeks}} after fledging, and adults have a complete <b>moult</b> after breeding. In both cases, if the process is not complete by the time of migration it is suspended and completed on the wintering grounds.|$|E
5|$|The jackal moults twice a year, {{in spring}} and in autumn. In Transcaucasia and Tajikistan, the spring <b>moult</b> begins {{at the end of}} winter. If the winter has been warm, the spring <b>moult</b> starts in the middle of February; if the winter has been cold, it begins in the middle of March. The spring <b>moult</b> lasts for 60–65 days; if the animal is sick, it loses only half of its winter fur. The spring <b>moult</b> commences with the head and limbs, extends to the flanks, chest, belly and rump, and ends at the tail. Fur on the underparts is absent. The autumn <b>moult</b> occurs from mid-September with the growth of winter fur; the {{shedding}} of the summer fur occurs at the same time. The development of the autumn coat starts with the rump and tail and spreads to the back, flanks, belly, chest, limbs and head, with full winter fur being attained at the end of November.|$|E

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{supposed}} <b>moulting</b> positions of the Bohemian Ordovician dalmanitoid and acastoid trilobites is presented.

5|$|The scaly {{juvenile}} plumage is retained until January or February of {{the year}} following hatching, when a lengthy <b>moult</b> of head and body feathers gives them a more adult-like appearance. Adults shed all their flight feathers simultaneously around this time, leaving them temporarily flightless, prior to gaining breeding plumage, but second-year birds delay this substantial <b>moult</b> until the summer. The adult winter plumage is attained between October and January by partial <b>moult</b> mainly of head, body and tail feathers.|$|E
5|$|The {{water pipit}} has a {{complete}} <b>moult</b> between July and September, {{although there is}} considerable individual variation in timing. There is a partial pre-breeding <b>moult,</b> mainly between January and March, but with much variability in timing. This <b>moult</b> typically involves replacing the head, body and some wing feathers, but the extent is again variable. Very occasionally, females may <b>moult</b> into what looks like non-breeding plumage, rather than the expected brighter garb. The chicks start to gain juvenile plumage {{as soon as a}} month after hatching, and most have completed the transition to near-adult appearance by September. The first pre-breeding <b>moult</b> {{is similar to that of}} the adult, but may be less complete or even absent.|$|E
5|$|When {{breeding}} is over, the {{black-necked grebe}} usually partakes in a <b>moult</b> migration to saline lakes.

Some birds, although, <b>moult</b> when on the breeding grounds, but most do not <b>moult</b> {{until the end of the}} <b>moult</b> migration. This migration is dangerous, with hundreds and sometimes thousands of birds being killed by snowstorms when traveling to places such as Mono Lake.|$|E

50|$|Flocks are {{sometimes}} force <b>moulted,</b> {{rather than being}} slaughtered, to reinvigorate egg-laying. This involves complete withdrawal of food (and sometimes water) for 7 to 14 days or sufficiently long to cause a body weight loss of 25 to 35%. This stimulates the hen to lose her feathers, but also reinvigorates egg-production. Some flocks may be force <b>moulted</b> several times. In 2003, more than 75% of all flocks were <b>moulted</b> in the US.
