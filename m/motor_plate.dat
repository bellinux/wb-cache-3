40|$|Blindness {{leads to}} a major {{reorganization}} of neural pathways associated with touch. Because incoming somatosensory information influences motor output, it is plausible that motor plasticity occurs in the blind. In this work, we evaluated this issue at the peripheral level in enucleated rats. Whisker muscles in enucleated rats 160 days of age or older showed increased cytochrome oxidase activity, capillary density, <b>motor</b> <b>plate</b> size, and amplitude of evoked field potentials as compared with their control counterparts. Such differences were not observed at ages 10 and 60 days, the capillary density was the exception being greater in the enucleated rat at the latter age. Interestingly, there was a trend to increased neurotrophin- 3 concentrations in the whisker pads of enucleated rats throughout postnatal development. Our results show that neonatal enucleation leads to late onset plasticity of the whisker's motor system...|$|E
40|$|The {{long held}} view that spiral nerve endings in extraocular muscles are sensory, {{recently}} {{shown to be}} incorrect for monkeys, was tested in man. Muscle samples were taken from orbits of five patients after eye enucleation and prepared for light and electron microscopy. Most spiral endings terminated in the <b>motor</b> end <b>plate</b> band in several well separated clusters of boutons applied to various aspects of individual fibres, {{in contrast to the}} single group of boutons of other endings. They displayed a dapple appearance using the acetylcholinesterase technique and possessed fine structural features characteristic of <b>motor</b> end <b>plates.</b> Approximately 5 % of <b>motor</b> end <b>plates</b> had spiral endings and most were sheathed by extensions from perineural epithelial cells. Hence, the spiralling of nerve fibre endings in man, as in monkeys, is a device for conveying boutons to dapple <b>motor</b> end <b>plates</b> rather than for monitoring the contraction of muscle fibres. It is suggested that muscle fibres with dapple <b>motor</b> end <b>plates</b> may be responsible for the exceptional speed of contraction of extraocular muscles...|$|R
40|$|The {{activity}} and properties of cholinesterase of the <b>motor</b> end <b>plate</b> in human intercostal muscle were {{studied in the}} isolated muscle membrane. This preparation was used because cholinesterase activity of the membrane preparation was localized in the <b>motor</b> end <b>plate</b> without contamination of cholinesterase of other muscle components. Under the experimental conditions, cholinesterase in a human end plate hydrolyzed 1. 21 × 108 molecules of acetylcholine per msec, which is smaller than hydrolysis of 2. 69 × 108 by a <b>motor</b> end <b>plate</b> of rat intercostal muscle. Studies with cholinesterase inhibitors and specific substrates indicated that about 90 % of cholinesterase of human motor endplates is acetylcholinesterase, and about 10 % is pseudocholinesterase. The end plate cholinesterase had an optimal pH of 7. 8 and a Michaelis-Menten constant of 4. 15 mmoles/liter, and was stable at 4 °C for at least 4 wk. <b>Motor</b> end <b>plates</b> were estimated to contain only about 2 % of the total cholinesterase activity of human intercostal muscle, compared with about 20 % in rat tibialis anterior muscle. The difference {{is due to the}} lower cholinesterase activity of the <b>motor</b> end <b>plate</b> and higher cholinesterase activity of non-end plate components in human muscle than in rat muscle. The isolated muscle membrane provides a useful preparation {{for the study of the}} properties of <b>motor</b> end <b>plate</b> in human skeletal muscle...|$|R

30|$|The maximum {{isometric}} tetanic force (maximum tetanic) {{measurements were}} obtained to assess nerve potential force. The anesthetized rabbits were placed supine on a custom-built <b>motor</b> <b>plate</b> platform. A skin incision at the anterior {{aspect of the}} ankle was made to expose the TA muscle. The distal femur was stabilized to the platform by drilling into the distal femoral diaphysis (parallel to {{the plane of the}} tibial plafond) and stabilized with Kirschner wires (Pfizer Howmedica, Rutherford, NJ, USA). The distal TA tendon was secured to the level arm attached to the stimulator. The common peroneal nerve was then stimulated using a bipolar stimulator device (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA). For each muscle contraction, the electrical signal generated by the force transducer was processed using LabVIEW software (National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA). Maximum contractile force was calculated by subtracting the initial preload and repeated three times for each limb with a 5 -min recovery interval.|$|E
40|$|Energy {{conservation}} {{strategies and}} production economies involve more than examining the cooling tower fan consumption of horse power. Colder water provides vast potentials for savings. Ask yourself, "What is the dollar and energy utilization value if I can obtain 1 ?F colder water off my cooling tower than I am now getting?" Therefore, let us first examine {{the elements of}} the cooling tower to determine the areas of greatest potential improvement to generate that colder water. The air flow generated by the fan should first be looked at In both counterflow or crossflow towers to determine that maximum flow is available through pitching fans up to within the <b>motor</b> <b>plate</b> amperage limitations and fan stall point calculations. If applicable, new fiberglass state of the art fans can be installed and additional motor horse power added. However, the most dramatic improvement that can be obtained in producing colder water is to retrofit modern film fill to replace the old fashioned wood splash bar slats...|$|E

This is an external temperature control system and can be replaced by any system you may have available. Extruder calibration To ensure the stepper movement translates into the piston movement accordingly to the g-code, it needs to be calibrated properly. Calibration set-up In principle, the calibration set-up requires: CNC control of the piston powering motor (we use Nema 11 with a planetary reductor) the assembled extruder (at least the moving parts) a precise displacement measurement device (calipers, etc., high precision indicators are preferrable) The calibration protocol requires a set-up, where the piston translation, can be precisely measured in the axis of extrusion. For this purpose, the measurement device is fixed on the extruder in a way, that the extruder movement is translated directly into the measurement. Calibration procedure adjust the steps/unit value of the motor settings in the cnc control software (or use default values) command piston movement for an exact distance measure the real movement distance and compare repeat steps 1 - 3, until the g-code value coincides with the measured value For a Nema 11 motor (with a planetary reductor) + an M 5 spindle (0. 5 mm pitch/rotation), the default STEPS/UNIT value is 37914. 30. Thermistor calibration Every thermistor analog output values have to be mapped to actual temperature values via an equation. Every thermistor needs to be calibrated as described in this section. EQUIPMENT: thermo block/plate (heat source), alcochol thermometer, thermistor, setup for reading analog signal from the thermistor, oil, glass. pour a small glass of oil (50 mL or so) place the glass on the heat source fit a thermistor to the alcochol thermometer sink the thermistor - thermometer setup into the glass with oil prepare the system to read analog values turn on the heat source and record sensor analog output at every 1 °C increment plot data (x - axis: analog output, y-axis: real temperature) fit the best trendline to the data obtained (MATLAB or EXCEL are good tools for completing this task but there are also others) software will yield a fit line equation which then has to be transcribed into microcontroller firmware (we used Arduino Mega) Now your thermistor will give out the right temperature values. step_vitaprint. zi...|$|E

40|$|The {{projection}} {{areas of}} vitally stained <b>motor</b> end <b>plates</b> in normal and tenotomized fast and slow twitch {{muscles of the}} rabbit hind limb were measured.

There was no significant change in the projection area of the FDL or gastrocnemius <b>motor</b> end <b>plates</b> after tenotomy. After tenotomy the deep (slow) component of the tibialis anterior showed an increase in the mean projection area of its end plates and so approached the faster superficial component in this respect. It appears therefore, that the altered pattern of activity of the slow motoneurons (which is known to occur after tenotomy) is associated with a change in the end plate size towards that normally found in muscles innervated by phasic motoneurons...|$|R
5000|$|Excess {{thyroxine}} {{is believed}} {{to bring about the}} onset of thyrotoxic myopathy and eventually cause the degradation of muscle tissue.

40|$|A {{technique}} is described of measuring the <b>motor</b> end <b>plate</b> jitter in the orbicularis oculi muscle activated by extra-muscular nerve stimulation, standardised for routine use in diagnosis {{and evaluation of}} neuromuscular transmission disorders. Among {{the advantages of the}} technique are comparatively quick and easy sampling of adequate number of single motor end-plates, convenient control of discharge rate between less than 1 and up to 20 Hz, absence of direct muscle fibre responses, and little discomfort for the patient. The jitter in the orbicularis oculi is significantly lower than that in the extensor digitorum communis muscle. There is a positive correlation between the jitter and the latency of the individual muscle fibre responses, possibly indicating that smaller diameter muscle fibres have slightly lower safety factor of neuromuscular transmission. The data collected in a group of healthy volunteers suggest the following upper normal limits for the mean of absolute consecutive difference of the latency: 30 microseconds for individual <b>motor</b> end <b>plates</b> (one out of 20 values may be higher), and 18 microseconds for a median of 20 <b>motor</b> end <b>plates...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abnormal humoral {{responses}} toward <b>motor</b> end <b>plate</b> constituents in muscle induce {{myasthenia gravis}} (MG). To study {{the etiology of}} this disease, and whether it could be induced by host defense molecules, we examined the consequences of interferon (IFN) "y production within the neuromuscular junction of transgenic mice. The transgenic mice exhibited gradually increasing muscular weakness, flaccid paralysis, and functional disruption of the neuromuscular junction that was reversed after administration of an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, features which are strikingly similar to human MG. Furthermore, histological examination revealed infiltration of mononuclear cells and autoantibody deposition at <b>motor</b> end <b>plates.</b> Immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that a previously unidentified 87 -kD target antigen was recognized by sera from transgenic mice and also by sera from the majority of human MG patients studied.

40|$|To {{determine}} the effects of nerve explants on the integrity of <b>motor</b> end <b>plates</b> in vitro, cholinesterase activity and structure of end plates were compared in newt muscle denervated in vivo, cultured in the absence of nerve explants, and cultured in the presence of sensory ganglia. In neuromuscular junctions denervated in vivo or in vitro, the synaptic vesicles become clumped and fragmented. A few intact vesicles escape into the synaptic cleft. Axon terminals degenerate until they are left as residual bodies within the Schwann cell cytoplasm. functional folds on the muscle surface are reduced in height and are no longer evident once traces of axoplasm within the Schwann cell disappear. End plate cholinesterase activity is reduced as junctional folds are lost. When muscle is cultured {{in the presence of a}} sensory ganglion, the terminal axoplasm degenerates in the same manner but junctional folds persist on the muscle surface. Moderately intense cholinesterase activity remains in association with the junctional folds, so that normal <b>motor</b> end <b>plates</b> are maintained in the absence of innervation. These results show that degenerative changes in the structure of the <b>motor</b> end <b>plate</b> and loss of cholinesterase activity occurring in organ culture as a result of denervation can be retarded by nerve explants that do not directly innervate the muscle...|$|R

2500|$|Muscle {{relaxation}} and paralysis can theoretically occur by interrupting function at several sites, including {{the central nervous}} system, myelinated somatic nerves, unmyelinated motor nerve terminals, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, the <b>motor</b> end <b>plate,</b> and the muscle membrane or contractile apparatus. Most neuromuscular blockers function by blocking transmission at the end plate of the neuromuscular junction. Normally, a nerve impulse arrives at the motor nerve terminal, initiating an influx of calcium ions, which causes the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles containing acetylcholine. Acetylcholine then diffuses across the synaptic cleft. It may be hydrolysed by acetylcholine esterase (AchE) or bind to the nicotinic receptors located on the <b>motor</b> end <b>plate.</b> The binding of two acetylcholine molecules results in a conformational change in the receptor that opens the sodium-potassium channel of the nicotinic receptor. This allows [...] and [...] ions to enter the cell and [...] ions to leave the cell, causing a depolarization of the end plate, resulting in muscle contraction. Following depolarization, the acetylcholine molecules are then removed from the end plate region and enzymatically hydrolysed by acetylcholinesterase.|$|R
