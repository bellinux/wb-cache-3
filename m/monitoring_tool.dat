25|$|No {{study has}} {{definitively}} demonstrated improved outcome in critically ill patients managed with PA catheters. Given that the PA catheter is a <b>monitoring</b> <b>tool</b> {{and not a}} therapy {{in and of itself}} this is not entirely surprising. Justification for its continued use rests on a large body of clinical experience, disadvantages of other cardiac output monitoring systems, its ability to accurately measure pulmonary artery pressure, and the potential to use the catheter as a direct conduit for drug administration into the pulmonary artery.|$|E
25|$|To date, few {{effective}} traps {{for adult}} Asian tiger mosquitoes are available. Those traps that catch {{other species of}} mosquitoes do not catch tiger mosquitoes efficiently. A form of an ovitrap called a lethal ovitrap mimics the breeding site for Ae. albopictus just like the <b>monitoring</b> <b>tool,</b> but it has {{the added benefit of}} contained chemicals that are toxic to the mosquitoes when they enter, but do not harm humans. These traps have had success in some countries to control Aedes mosquito populations. A new trap type has now been shown to catch significant numbers of Ae. albopictus. This device, {{with the help of a}} ventilator, produces an upward air current of ammonia, fatty acids, and lactic acids that takes a similar form and smell of a human body. With the addition of carbon dioxide, the efficacy of the trap is increased. This means a suitable tool is available for trapping adult tiger mosquitoes, and for example, examining the existence of viruses in the trapped mosquitoes. Previously, the mosquitoes had to be collected from volunteers to be studied, which is ethically questionable, especially during epidemics. Recent research also indicates this trap type may also have a use as a control tool; in a study in Cesena, Italy, the number of biting tiger mosquitoes was reduced in places where traps were installed.|$|E

[...] The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife's (WDFW) Puget Sound Assessment and Monitoring Program (PSAMP), Snohomish County Marine Resources Committee (MRC), Snohomish County Public Works-Surface Water Management, Washington Sea Grant, and NOAA's Mussel Watch collaborated to; “conduct field-sampling for the 2009/10 Mussel Watch season in Washington waters, evaluate the possibility of merging field sampling with existing toxic contaminant monitoring in Puget Sound, demonstrate and evaluate the use citizen scientists as a primary resource for conducting field work and investigate the feasibility of Mussel Watch as a <b>monitoring</b> <b>tool</b> in Puget Sound.” This involved a representative from NOAA assisting PSAMP staff and volunteers with a successful sampling of all Mussel Watch sites. The result of this pilot project was {{a significant reduction in}} labor time of professional staff in the field due to the assistance and proper training of citizen scientist volunteers. Proper training of volunteers is necessary to maintain consistent and accurate collection methods.|$|E

40|$|Monitoring and Reporting are an {{integral}} part of IT infrastructure. Lack of single tool that covers all the need for monitoring in an organization has led to uses of different kinds of <b>monitoring</b> <b>tools</b> within an organization. Existence of diverse <b>monitoring</b> <b>tools</b> has led to significant heterogeneity in an infrastructure between the tools and the data they measure. The <b>monitoring</b> <b>tools</b> generally differs in the data structures and interaction interfaces that they implement. One of the key issue in todays monitoring scenario is the interoperability between several monitoring system and the heterogeneous data they produce. In this thesis some of the current monitoring problems that arises due to diversity in <b>monitoring</b> <b>tools</b> are briefly discussed. It also discusses how a standard common data model can benefit the interoperability between the tools. The implementation of simple proof of concept integration between selected <b>monitoring</b> <b>tools</b> is also explored. The results of implementation indicates the benefits of information interchange between the tools for solving many problems or difficulties that are discussed. The thesis also addresses some challenges in data integration between different tools...|$|R

40|$|Social {{networks}} are important means for communication, engaging millions of users around the globe.

40|$|Performance <b>monitoring</b> <b>tools</b> play a {{critical}} role in the overall productivity of business organizations by providing the necessary means of measuring the performance of the system or server attributes of the organization. They measure system or server throughput and processor usage through programmed software or technological platforms. Their monitoring is extremely efficient such that Network administrators normally rely on them wholeheartedly and without any doubts. Their monitoring statistical results normally compel the Network Administrators to either believe that the system or server performance is normal or else make decisive interventions on system or server performance. The efficiency of these performance <b>monitoring</b> <b>tools</b> builds confidence and reliability in Network Administrators such that they always view the statistical results as accurate and genuine. The responsibility of measuring the performance accuracy of the performance <b>monitoring</b> <b>tools</b> normally does not constitute the duties and responsibilities of Network Administrators. This, therefore, result into a situation whereby this essential responsibility is not executed under the presumption that the performance <b>monitoring</b> <b>tools</b> are accurate and genuine. This holds in various business organizations despite the fact that some of these performance <b>monitoring</b> <b>tools</b> may poorly perform under certain server or system conditions. It is with this background that this research project is undertaken, which is to conduct an exploration scrutiny of applications and Agentless server performance <b>monitoring</b> <b>tools.</b> The basis behind the exploration scrutiny is to advise and provide expert guidance to Network Server and Applications Administrators on what to monitor, why to monitor, and optimal threshold...|$|R
