40|$|The {{northern}} Andaman Sea {{including the}} Myanmar waters {{is one of}} the least studied regions of the northern Indian Ocean. The freshwater and suspended sediments carried by Ayeyawady / Irrawaddy, the peculiar surface circulation, coastline morphology and shallow bathymetry in the Gulf of Mottama facilitate several diverse environmental settings in the study region. In order to understand the environmental settings and their linkages to the plankton community in the study region, this paper combined in- situ data of ‘First India- Myanmar Joint Oceanographic Expedition ’ with satellite oceanography observations. The study period was the Spring Inter-monsoon (<b>March-</b> <b>May),</b> which was characterized by high tidal activity in the Gulf of Mottama region (tidal height 6 - 8 m) causing strong tidal currents and re-suspension of sediments. The tidal currents and eastward advection of Ayeyawady influx caused the lowest salinity, highest concentration of nutrients, suspended sediments and chlorophyll a in the Gulf of Mottama region. Conversely, high salinity, highest temperature, lowest nutrients and suspended sediments prevalent in the offshore waters of the northern Andaman Sea induced a massive bloom of Trichodesmium erythreum, which was mostly in the declining phase during the observation.

A composite analysis performed over 0 field averaged between longitudes 10 °W- 10 °E shows that the wettest (driest) July-September Sahelian rainy seasons have been preceded by negative (positive) anomalies of soil-vegetation water content over the Sudanian belt in June and positive (negative) ones over Guinea from winter to spring. While the former anomalies are linked to synchronous rainfall deficits, sign of delayed northward jump of the ITCZ, the latter do not coincide with any synchronous signal in precipitations. A 'Granger causality' analysis reveals that spring (<b>March-</b> <b>May)</b> anomalies of soil-vegetation water content are rather due to those recorded in rainfall during the preceding autumn (September-November) than to a persistence of winter 0 anomalies. These findings argue for inter-season memory effects in West Africa held by land surface state.

40|$|This {{study is}} to {{evaluate}} the future climate change impact on the river discharge of the Brahmaputra River, a trans-boundary river entering in Bangladesh through the north from India, using SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model. To reduce the uncertainty, the model has been calibrated and validated using the observed daily flow data at Bahadurabad from 1998 to 2007 and soil moisture data. Hydrological predicted values matched well with the observed values by showing coefficient of determination (R) from 0. 83 to 0. 85 for stream flow. Climate scenarios from the model EC-Earth under different representative concentration pathways (RCPs) of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) AR 5 (Assessment Report 5) have been fed to the SWAT model and the river discharge for the Brahmaputra River has been estimated for three time windows, i. e. 2020 s (2011 - 2040), 2050 s (2041 - 2070) and 2080 s (2071 - 2100).

40|$|Graduation date: 2008 The {{potential}} for Rocky Mountain mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus hemionus) to host exotic chewing lice (Damalinia (Cervicola) sp.) believed to cause deer hair loss syndrome in Columbian black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus), {{was investigated in}} captive deer held in pens at E. E. Wilson Wildlife Area, Corvallis, Oregon from March 2004 to May 2005. It is believed that the exotic chewing louse causes a hypersensitivity reaction which results in pruritis, excessive grooming and removal of pelage. The potential transmission of D. (Cervicola) sp. from affected black-tailed deer to Rocky Mountain mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus hemionus) was unknown. To answer this question, unaffected mule deer were both experimentally infested (inoculated) with D. (Cervicola) sp., and held {{in direct contact with}} (D. (Cervicola) sp.) infested black-tailed deer. Grooming behavior, louse abundance, and clinical signs were monitored and recorded monthly for 14 months. The exotic louse D. (Cervicola) sp. was identified on six mule deer following treatment, and evidence of louse reproduction (eggs, and nymphs) was present. A strong seasonal pattern in louse abundance was observed in all groups and within subspecies, and was correlated with date, with higher louse abundances occurring from April-June 2004, and <b>March-</b> <b>May</b> 2005; lower numbers occurred from August 2004 through February 2005. Eggs, nymphs and adult lice were found on all body regions, and abundances varied by month. Mule deer held in direct contact with infested black-tailed deer showed slight increases in frequency of grooming behavior from January to April 2005 in conjunction with increasing louse abundance and grooming bout duration. Six mule deer developed small localized patches of hair-loss following treatment; two had hair loss throughout much of their sides and rump. Eight black-tailed deer showed signs of recovery {{at the end of the}} study. It was concluded that transmission of the exotic louse D.

40|$|Until around 2000, {{the marine}} {{gastropod}} Gibbula umbilicalis (Da Costa 1778) was previously only present as far east as the Isle of Wight {{on the south}} coast of England. Since 2000 the range of Gibbula umbilicalis has extended 140 km eastwards with records now present as far along the coast as Kent. Since the 1990 s temperatures in the English Channel have increased faster (and to higher levels) than during any other period recorded. The importance of sea temperature driving the range extension of Gibbula umbilicalis has not been fully evaluated. Field and laboratory {{studies were carried out}} between March and September 2015 on populations at two long-established sites in the west of the Channel (Lyme Regis and Osmington) and two recently colonised (since 2000) sites in the east (Cuckmere and Eastbourne) to determine whether: I. reproductive development and spawning was synchronised between different populations, and whether it was correlated to sea temperature; II. there was evidence of recent recruitment at the ―new‖ sites and if there was a difference in population structure at each location;. III. new populations east of the Isle of Wight can now be considered established. Reproductive development was positively correlated to sea temperature, however this was not synchronised between sites; populations at Lyme Regis and Osmington matured before Cuckmere and Eastbourne, although the differences were slight. By September, spawning had begun at the long-established (western) sites but not the recently colonised (eastern) sites. There was evidence of recruitment of a 2014 cohort at all sites. However, the number of juveniles observed was lower in the eastern Channel during spring (<b>March-</b> <b>May)</b> in comparison with western sites, but increased each month from June onwards. The later detection of juveniles in the east is attributed to delayed spawning and settlement. On the evidence of continuing reproductive development and recent recruitment, populations at Cuckmere and Eastbourne can now be considered established. Their proximity to the continent exposes them to colder winters which may intermittently increase mortality. However, it is considered that these populations are now sufficiently large to withstand all but extreme events. The range extension of Gibbula umbilicalis in the eastern English Channel is attributed to multiple factors related to increasing temperatures. Higher summer sea temperatures are likely to have accelerated gonad development and spawning at the previous range limit. This provided juveniles more time to mature before temperatures fell during winter. Increased size/fitness limits winter mortality and promotes recruitment, resulting in growth of the range-edge populations. The larger breeding population resulted in an increase in larval supply, allowing the barrier at the range-limit to be penetrated and new sites seeded. The annual sea temperature increases will have had the same effect on the new arrivals settling in the eastern Channel; recruitment at levels exceeding mortality, allowing the populations to increase and become established...|$|E
40|$|The diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (Linnaeus) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), is a {{cosmopolitan}} insect pest of Brassica crops. In South Africa, {{there are no}} action thresholds for its chemical control which {{makes it difficult for}} growers to make informed decisions on when to apply insecticides and how frequently to apply them in order to achieve optimal crop yield. To contribute towards optimum application of insecticides against P. xylostella, this study compared the impact of weekly and bi-weekly applications of a selective insecticide Dipel® (Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner var. kurstaki) applied at 250 g/ha, and a broad-spectrum insecticide Dichlorvos (an organophosphate) applied at 1 ml/L against biological control (Control) on the pest population density on cabbage during October– December 2011 and March–May 2012. The use of both selective and broad-spectrum insecticides for experiments enables us to understand if efforts to optimise cabbage yield depend mainly on effective suppression of P. xylostella densities. Furthermore, investigations were carried out to determine the impact of these chemicals on parasitism rates of P. xylostella and species richness of its primary parasitoids. During the October–December 2011 growing season, the lowest infestation of P. xylostella occurred on cabbage plots that received weekly application of Dipel and the highest on untreated control plots. Cabbage weights were negatively related to infestation levels, implying that weekly application of Dipel yielded bigger cabbage heads. During <b>March–</b> <b>May</b> 2012, P. xylostella infestations were again higher on the control followed by weekly and bi-weekly treatments of Dichlorvos, then weekly and bi-weekly applications of Dipel. Despite the significant differences observed, infestation levels were much lower ( 80 % of total parasitism levels in all treatments. Parasitism levels were not significantly different among the treatments in both seasons. Parasitoid species richness was highest on the control. Although two parasitoid species were recorded in all Dipel and Dichlorvos treatments during October–December 2011, only one parasitoid species was recorded in the Dipel treatments during March–May 2012 compared to two species in Dichlorvos treatments. Although weekly applications of Dipel ensured good yield and crop quality during October–December, weekly applications of the chemical did not lead to better quality crop during March–May crop growing season. Thus, {{it is not necessary to}} apply insecticides during periods in which natural mortality of P. xylostella is high due to parasitoids. Since P. xylostella abundance was a determining factor of crop quality, these results imply that insect pest management should focus mainly on suppressing its numbers. Furthermore, there was no evidence that application of either insecticide type had a negative impact on parasitism rates of P. xylostella. The lower parasitoid species richness on Dipel treated plots was the consequence of its higher efficiency in suppressing the pest population which substantially reduced availability of potential hosts for parasitoids, hence only the efficient C. vestalis was recorded at low host densitiesAgriculture and  Animal HealthM.

Comparison of the BWP data from MCMA- 2003 with other campaigns shows that the same conclusion holds for several other urban, rural and remotes sites. This means that the aerodynamic lens in the AMS is capable of efficiently focusing ambient particles into a well defined beam and onto the AMS vaporizer for particles sampled {{in a wide variety of}} environments. All the species measured by the AMS during MCMA- 2003 have similar attenuation profiles which suggests that the particles that dominate the mass concentration were internally mixed most of the time. Only for the smaller particles (especially below 300 nm), organic and inorganic species show different attenuation versus particle size which is likely due to partial external mixing of these components. Changes observed in the focusing of the particle beam in time can be attributed, in part, to changes in particle shape (i. e. due to relative humidity) and size of the particles sampled. However, the relationships between composition, atmospheric conditions, and particle shape and size appear to be very complex and are not yet completely understood...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{irrigation}} and nitrogen (N) fertilizer on Hagberg falling number (HFN), specific weight (SW) and blackpoint (BP) of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L) were investigated. Mains water (+ 50 and + 100 mm month(- 1), containing 44 mg NO 3 - litre(- 1) and 28 mg SO 42 - litre(- 1)) was applied with trickle irrigation during winter (17 January- 17 March), spring (21 <b>March-</b> 20 <b>May)</b> or summer (24 May- 23 July). In 1999 / 2000 these treatments were factorially combined with three N levels (0, 200, 400 kg N ha(- 1)), applied to cv Hereward. In 2000 / 01 the 400 kg N ha(- 1) treatment {{was replaced with}} cv Malacca given 200 kg N ha(- 1). Irrigation increased grain yield, mostly by increasing grain numbers when applied in winter and spring, and by increasing mean grain weight when applied in summer. Nitrogen increased grain numbers and SW, and reduced BP in both years. Nitrogen increased HFN in 1999 / 2000 and reduced HFN in 2000 / 01. Effects of irrigation on HFN, SW and BP were smaller and inconsistent over year and nitrogen level. Irrigation interacted with N on mean grain weight: negatively for winter and spring irrigation, and positively for summer irrigation. Ten variables derived from digital image analysis of harvested grain were included with mean grain weight in a principal components analysis. The first principal component ('size') was negatively related to HFN (in two years) and BP (one year), and positively related to SW (two years). Treatment effects on dimensions of harvested grain could not explain all of the effects on HFN, BP and SW but the results {{were consistent with the}} hypothesis that water and nutrient availability, even when they were affected early in the season, could influence final grain quality if they influenced grain numbers and size.

40|$|Wind power {{construction}} {{and plans for}} further construction projects {{have given rise to}} concern as to their impacts on birds and bats. Collisions of these species with wind turbines have been reported round the world. The review concerning the impacts of wind power projects on birds and bats in international peer-reviewed literature and reports on the impacts of wind power on these species, commissioned by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment, was conducted on 1 <b>March–</b> 30 <b>May</b> 2017. Based on the literature, birds and bats collide with wind turbines in in highly varying numbers, and the location of the turbines is important in terms of collision mortality. There is also considerable variation in the susceptibility of different species and sub-species to collide with wind turbines. In some places large numbers of birds and bats have collided with wind turbines built in unfortunate locations in terms of these species, but hardly any impacts on their population size have been observed. In the case of bats, in particular, lack of information on the ecology and population size of the species makes it difficult to detect changes in the population. For some bird species the disturbance and blocking effect of wind turbines may be more significant than collision mortality, but in most cases these impacts are restricted to the immediate vicinity of wind turbines and no impacts on the population size in larger regions have been observed. Based on research the building of more wind turbines in Finland is not likely to cause a significant threat to bird and bat populations, if the turbines are located in areas where their population densities are low and the risk of collisions can be minimised. However, there is not yet enough information on the impacts of wind turbines on birds and bats, and further studies and monitoring are needed to make sure that new wind power building projects will not affect the population sizes of species that are susceptible to collision in the future. In Finland, in particular, more research focused on bats and long-term monitoring of the impacts of wind turbines after they have been built are needed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAn Aerodyne Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS) was {{deployed}} at the CENICA Supersite, {{during the}} Mexico City Metropolitan Area field study (MCMA- 2003) from 31 <b>March-</b> 4 <b>May</b> 2003 to investigate particle concentrations, sources, and processes. The AMS provides real time information on mass concentration {{and composition of}} the non-refractory species in particulate matter less than 1 µm (NR-PM 1) with high time and size-resolution. In order {{to account for the}} refractory material in the aerosol, we also present estimates of Black Carbon (BC) using an aethalometer and an estimate of the aerosol soil component obtained from Proton-Induced X-ray Emission Spectrometry (PIXE) analysis of impactor substrates. Comparisons of AMS + BC + soil mass concentration with other collocated particle instruments (a LASAIR Optical Particle Counter, a PM 2. 5 Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance (TEOM), and a PM 2. 5 DustTrak Aerosol Monitor) show that the AMS + BC + soil mass concentration is consistent with the total PM 2. 5 mass concentration during MCMA- 2003 within the combined uncertainties. In Mexico City, the organic fraction of the estimated PM 2. 5 at CENICA represents, on average, 54. 6 % (standard deviation ?= 10 %) of the mass, with the rest consisting of inorganic compounds (mainly ammonium nitrate and sulfate/ammonium salts), BC, and soil. Inorganic compounds represent 27. 5 % of PM 2. 5 (?= 10 %); BC mass concentration is about 11 % (?= 4 %); while soil represents about 6. 9 % (?= 4 %). Size distributions are presented for the AMS species; they show an accumulation mode that contains mainly oxygenated organic and secondary inorganic compounds. The organic size distributions also contain a small organic particle mode that is likely indicative of fresh traffic emissions; small particle modes exist for the inorganic species as well. Evidence suggests that the organic and inorganic species are not always internally mixed, especially in the small modes. The aerosol seems to be neutralized most of the time; however, there were some periods when there was not enough ammonium to completely neutralize the nitrate, chloride and sulfate present. The diurnal cycle and size distributions of nitrate suggest local photochemical production. On the other hand, sulfate appears to be produced on a regional scale. There are indications of new particle formation and growth events when concentrations of SO 2 were high. Although the sources of chloride are not clear, this species seems to condense as ammonium chloride {{early in the morning and}} to evaporate as the temperature increases and RH decreases. The total and speciated mass concentrations and diurnal cycles measured during MCMA- 2003 are similar to measurements during a previous field campaign at a nearby location...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the climatic trends of rainfall and temperature in Uganda using historical data. And because climate {{is an important}} aspect in water resources management and livelihoods formation, an attempt {{to explain how the}} interaction impacts on the two is made in the context of climate variability and change. The assumption is that climate change/variability has had an effect on water resources management and the way individual, households and society at large form livelihoods in Uganda. The rationale for the investigation is the number of climate and livelihood related studies that have been undertaken for Uganda over recent years, which have not focused specifically on the water resources management and livelihood formation. The study is grounded by reviewing the theoretical perspectives of climate science which underpin the concepts of climate change, climate variability and impacts on livelihoods in the world, tropics, Africa, east Africa and Uganda in that order. A cross sectional research design based on selected case studies from sub-counties located in the main sub-basins across the country is used. Both qualitative and quantitative data analysis techniques are applied independently or in combination on climatic data from Uganda‟s Department of Meteorology, data generated from field interviews and landsat images. The data sets are analysed using MS EXCEL, SPSS, MATLAB, ANCLIM, TREND TOOL, GIS and ENVI 4. 8 to establish climatic trends and deduce evidence of change and variability. The impact on livelihood formation is investigated through the assets available to the households using the DFID framework. The study therefore has investigated the characteristics of climate in Uganda especially by following up on the responses that arose from the field study. Through their own observations, respondents noticed changes in temperature and rainfall. Temperature variables like diurnal temperature range, maximum and minimum temperatures and rainfall (monthly, seasonal, annual) have been investigated, to establish whether these observations were impacting on livelihood formations and water resources which are central in the wellbeing of individual households. Results show decadal variability of rainfall with marked seasonal cycles, temporal variability of drought patterns is detected; variations in annual rainfall are low with no significant trends observed in the main drainage sub-basins. Significant trends occur in October, November, December and January. A noticeable decrease in the annual total rainfall was observed mostly in north-western and south-western sub-basins. Rainfall trend in the second normal of June-July-August (JJA) is decreasing in all the main drainage sub-basins; highest rainfall was recorded in April, while January, June and July have the lowest rainfall. Spatial analysis results show that stations close to Lake Victoria recorded high amounts of rainfall. Average annual coefficient of variability was 19 % signifying low variability. Rainfall distribution is bi-modal with maximums experienced in <b>March-</b> April- <b>May</b> and September- October- November seasons of the year. PCI values show a moderate to seasonal rainfall distribution. FNW Nsubuga – University of Pretoria Page 11 Spectral analyses of the time components reveal the existence of a major period around 3, 6 and 10 years. Intra-annual temperature show reduced variability over recent decades, which is not statistically significant. Maximum temperatures are more variable compared to minimum temperatures in Uganda. An increasing trend in hot days, hot nights, warm nights and warm spells are also detected. At seven of the stations, annual temperature range and diurnal temperature range trends are negative. The finding that intra-annual and intra-monthly variance is declining suggests that fewer anomalously extreme temperature episodes occur. The gap between maximum and minimum extremes is reducing, which supports the observation that minimum temperatures are on the increase. At a micro-level analysis using Namulonge as a case study, total rainfall in March-May season decreased, while maximum temperatures increased between April and September, with statistically significant trends at 5 % confidence level. The Mann-Kendall test revealed that the number of wet days reduced significantly. Temperatures are warmer and rainfall higher in the first climate normal compared to the recent 30 years. Direct rainfall, which is the most important source of water for water resources, recently, is experiencing variability, which is threatening the distribution of water resources in Uganda. The characteristics, availability, demand and importance of present day water resources in Uganda as well as the various issues, and challenges pertaining to management of water resources of the country are established. The present analysis reveals that surface-water area fluctuation is linked to rainfall variability. In particular, Lake Kyoga basin lakes experienced an increase in surface-water area in 2010 compared to 1986. This work has important implications to water resources management and people whose livelihoods depend on natural resources especially in this era of climate change. Evidence from the field survey validates what data analysis reveals from historical data. Respondents from the field study are aware of climate change, had noticed some changes in climatic variables and were adapting by changing lifestyle and diversifying to activities that are less prone to weather. Livelihoods in Uganda have evolved based on the availability of opportunity afforded by the natural resources base including water resources.
