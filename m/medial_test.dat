Methods. Forty patients diagnosed with knee OA were {{randomly assigned to one of}} 2 topical treatment groups: (1) cetylated fatty acid (CFA) (n = 20; age 62. 7 ± 11. 7 yrs); or (2) placebo group (n = 20; age 64. 6 ± 10. 5 yrs). Patients were tested on 3 occasions: (1) baseline (T 1), (2) 30 min after initial treatment (T 2), and (3) after 30 -day treatment of cream application twice per day (T 3).

40|$|Background: Energy cost {{of walking}} is two times higher in {{children}} with cerebral palsy when compared with normal children; {{this may be due}} to gait abnormalities. There is a negative influence on physical activity and early onsets of fatigue in activities of daily living are evident in cerebral palsy children and the reason for this is increase in energy cost of walking. Therefore, the treatment techniques which targets on correction of gait abnormalities and Energy conservation during walking are important to maintain orimprove independent functioning. The aim is to find out the effects of using Supra Malleolar Orthosis (SMO) along with co-activation exercise in the increase of gait endurance and also to encourage independent skills and abilities in cerebral palsy child. Methods: A 14 years child with spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy was treated with custom made supra malleolar orthotic which was designed with an orthotic support followed with specific exercises, co-activating dorsiflexors and plantar flexors actively and with assistance. The subject was made to do the co-activation exercises 3 days per week for 8 weeks. Step length, stride length, cadence, navicular drop <b>test,</b> <b>medial</b> arch height and calcaneal eversion were measured before starting the treatment and at the end of 8 th week. Results: the results of treatment shows that there is an improvement in 2 minutes’ walk test from 7 (pre-test) to 13, step length from 22 (pre-test) to 32,stride length from 36 (pre-test) to 47,cadence from 39 (pretest) to 37 after the use of Supra Malleolar Orthosis (SMO) and a co-activation exercises intervention. There was a clear and significant improvement noted in navicular drop <b>test,</b> <b>medial</b> arch height and calcaneal eversion after a period of 8 weeks use of orthosis and exercise intervention when compared with pre-test value. Conclusion: Orthotic subtalar alignment with co-acticvation exercises for alteration in gait endurance in a child is showing significantly good results in this case study of a child with cerebral palsy. The Co-activation exercise with Supra Malleolar Orthotic support reduces the intensity of symptoms and improved gait parameters in cerebral palsy child...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{proximodistal}} (PD) {{axis of the}} Drosophila leg {{is thought}} to be established by the combined gradients of two secreted morphogens, Wingless (Wg) and Decapentaplegic (Dpp). According to this model, high [Wg+Dpp] activates Distalless (Dll) and represses dachshund (dac) in the distal cells of the leg disc, while intermediate [Wg+Dpp] activates dac in <b>medial</b> tissue. To <b>test</b> this model we identified and characterized a dac cis-regulatory element (dac RE) that recapitulates dac's medial expression domain during leg development. Counter to the gradient model, we find that Wg and Dpp do not act in a graded manner to activate RE. Instead, dac RE is activated directly by Dll and repressed distally by a combination of factors, including the homeodomain protein Bar. Thus, medial leg fates are established via a regulatory cascade in which Wg+Dpp activate Dll and then Dll directly activates dac, with Wg+Dpp as less critical, permissive inputs...|$|R

Foram estudados o arranjo e o diâmetro médio das fibrilas colágenas do ligamento colateral medial da articulação do cotovelo do cão, isolado ou associado ao ligamento oblíquo e tracionado até a ruptura. Dezoito articulações foram divididas em três grupos. O primeiro grupo teve o ligamento colateral medial coletado, mas não tracionado; o segundo grupo teve o ligamento colateral medial tracionado isoladamente; o terceiro grupo teve os ligamentos colateral medial e oblíquo tracionados associadamente. O ligamento colateral medial não submetido ao ensaio de tração apresentou um padrão ondulado das fibras colágenas, o qual não foi totalmente destruído quando foi tracionado, associado ao ligamento oblíquo, e perdeu totalmente o padrão reticular das fibras colágenas quando testado isoladamente. Quando o ligamento colateral medial foi submetido à tensão isoladamente, o diâmetro médio das fibrilas colágenas aumentou em relação ao grupo não submetido à tensão. Associado ao ligamento oblíquo, o diâmetro médio das fibrilas colágenas foi o maior na região de inserção e o menor na região média, em relação aos outros grupos.

40|$|The study {{investigates the}} impact of visual cues and lexical {{knowledge}} on the identification of a nonnative phonemic contrast. Twenty native Colombians were tested on an identification task involving 16 minimal pairs of English words, produced by four English speakers, contrasting {{in the presence of}} /b/ or /v/ in initial or <b>medial</b> position. The <b>test</b> was run in three conditions: audiovisual (AV), audio only (A) or visual only (V). Prior to the identification task, their knowledge of the lexical items was evaluated; they were also recorded while reading the words. Mean identification scores were higher for the AV than the A condition, but V and AV scores not differ. Relative to previous /b/-/v/ studies with Peninsular Spanish speakers, Colombians relied more heavily on visual cues in their identification of /b/-/v/. Although there was a trend for identification scores to be higher for known lexical items, this effect was not statistically significant. Finally, production accuracy for the /b/-/v/ contrast was not correlated with perception accuracy, but production tended to be more accurate in speakers with better lexical knowledge. The visual weighting results suggest that the degree of visual bias in speech perception may be ‘culture-specific’ rather than merely ‘language-specific’...|$|R
40|$|Poster Presentation: P 47 Endocannabinoid (eCB) {{has emerged}} as the key form of activity-dependent {{long-term}} presynspatic plasticity in the amygdala, hippocampus and visual cortex. eCB receptors are found to express in the vestibular nucleus but the role of eCB on long-term depression of inhibitory responses (iLTD) in central vestibular neurons remains unaddressed. Whole-cell patch-clamp experiments were therefore conducted on medial vestibular neurons in brainstem slices of postnatal rats (P 5 ─ 15). iLTD of GABAA receptor-mediated evoked-IPSCs could be induced in these central vestibular neurons with theta-burst stimulation delivered to the vestibular afferents. In P 5 ─ 7 rats, iLTD could be induced in 80 % of the <b>medial</b> vestibular neurons <b>tested.</b> In P 8 ─ 15 rats, however, iLTD could only be induced in 30 % of the neurons tested. Application of antagonist of type 1 cannabinoid receptor (AM 251) decreased the probability of iLTD induction to 30 % in rats aged P 5 to P 7, while treatment with agonist of type 1 cannabinoid receptor (WIN 55) increased the probability to 70 % in rats aged P 8 to P 10. These results indicate that eCB modulates the efficacy of GABAergic synapses in the vestibular nucleus in an age-dependent role manner. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|AbstractConnectivity {{preservation}} is {{a concern}} {{in the design of}} image processing algorithms for parallel reduction processes like thinning where connected components in 2 -D images are reduced to <b>medial</b> axis approximations. <b>Tests</b> and proof techniques, which use local support for their computations, have been presented by Rosenfeld, Ronse and others to prove preservation of connectivity for reduction classes of thinning algorithms. In this paper the earlier Rosenfeld proof techniques are characterized as connectivity preservation tests for rectangular and hexagonal tessellations and simplified versions of these tests are developed. The later Ronse tests are characterized for rectangular and hexagonal tessellations; the Ronse test complexities are evaluated; and relevant equivalences are identified between the Rosenfeld and Ronse test forms. It is shown that forms of the Ronse tests for rectangular and hexagonal tessellations are derivable directly and simply from tests derived from the earlier Rosenfeld proof techniques. Arguments are given to establish under what operator support restrictions these tests are necessary and sufficient proofs for key connectivity preservation properties. Finally, a specific computer-based implementation of the Ronse test is described with extensions for reduction operators with larger supports and with reduction operators using subfields notions; and time performance results are given for this implementation...|$|R
40|$|Background Abduction of the forefoot, {{relative}} to the rearfoot, is a component of rearfoot pronation. It is therefore feasible that an ill-fitting shoe, which creates a relative abduction of the forefoot, could influence rearfoot motion with a corresponding effect on transverse plane tibial rotation. Aim To investigate whether transverse plane motion of the tibia is altered with specially designed footwear in which {{the front of the}} shoe is positioned either laterally or medially. Methods Kinematic data was collected from n= 9 participants during running at 3. 9 m/s in three footwear conditions: baseline, lateral forefoot and <b>medial</b> forefoot. ANOVA <b>testing</b> was then used to understand whether the different shoe designs affected tibial and/or pelvic motions. Results There was marked inter-subject variability in response to the two designs. Whereas some participants responded to the lateral design with a decrease in tibial rotation, others responded with a clear increase in external transverse tibial rotation. However, the mean effect was small and there were no significant difference in either the transverse tibial angle at initial contact or the transverse tibial range of movement. Interesting, the footwear designs appeared to have an effect on frontal plane pelvic motion. However, in some subjects pelvic motions were increased, whereas in others they were decreased, again leading to a non-significant mean effect. Conclusion These results may support the idea that an ill-fitting running shoe could lead to alterations in lower limb kinematics; however further work is required to understand individual differences in response...|$|R
40|$|In the avian forebrain, {{the medial}} {{striatum}} and the intermediate medial mesopallium {{are thought to}} be important structures for associative learning in chicks, where the role of dopaminergic systems in learning processes has been verified in various behavioral paradigms, such as one-trial passive avoidance learning. However, it is not yet clear whether the dopaminergic system of these regions is responsible for associative learning underlying cue-elicited drug reward. In this study, a 6 -day conditioning schedule in day-old chicks with i. p. morphine (2 mg/kg) was used to compare the effects of intracerebrally injected dopamine D(1) receptor antagonist, SCH 23390, and D(2) antagonist, spiperone. The antagonists were injected bilaterally (3 mu g/site) into either the medial striatum or the intermediate <b>medial</b> mesopallium, and <b>tests</b> were conducted on morphine-induced conditioned place preference or locomotor activity. The acquisition of place preference was significantly inhibited by SCH 23390 in either the medial striatum or the intermediate medial mesopallium, but not by spiperone. However, in the medial striatum, but not in the intermediate medial mesopallium, the locomotor activity was blocked by both SCH 23390 and spiperone. These data suggest that the medial striatum and the intermediate medial mesopallium in birds are differentially involved in the rewarding effects of morphine, and similarly to mammals, the dopamine D(1) system may {{play an important role in}} the development of opiate reward.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{validate}} use {{of stress}} MRI {{for evaluation of}} stifle joints of dogs with an intact or deficient cranial cruciate ligament (CrCL). SAMPLE 10 cadaveric stifle joints from 10 dogs. PROCEDURES A custom-made limb-holding device and a pulley system linked to a paw plate were used to apply axial compression across the stifle joint and induce cranial tibial translation with the joint in various degrees of flexion. By use of sagittal proton density-weighted MRI, CrCL-intact and deficient stifle joints were evaluated under conditions of loading stress simulating the tibial compression test or the cranial drawer <b>test.</b> <b>Medial</b> and lateral femorotibial subluxation following CrCL transection measured under a simulated tibial compression test and a cranial drawer test were compared. RESULTS By use of tibial compression test MRI, the mean ± SD cranial tibial translations in the medial and lateral compartments were 9. 6 ± 3. 7 mm and 10 ± 4. 1 mm, respectively. By use of cranial drawer test MRI, the mean ± SD cranial tibial translations in the medial and lateral compartments were 8. 3 ± 3. 3 mm and 9. 5 ± 3. 5 mm, respectively. No significant difference in femorotibial subluxation was found between stress MRI techniques. Femorotibial subluxation elicited by use of the cranial drawer test was greater in the lateral than in the medial compartment. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Both stress techniques induced stifle joint subluxation following CrCL transection that was measurable by use of MRI, suggesting that both methods may be further evaluated for clinical use...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPrevious {{experimental}} studies (e. g. Kovacs I, Julesz B. Nature (London) 1994; 370 : 644 – 646) have found enhanced contrast sensitivity at medial locations, supporting theoretical speculations that the visual system represents simple spatial regions by their medial axes. The core model (Burbeck CA, Pizer SM. Vis Res 1995; 35 : 1917 – 1930) hypothesizes that the medial representation arises in a scale-specific way: {{the scale is}} determined by local object width, and it controls the resolution at which the medial locus and object width are encoded. Here we look for further evidence for a <b>medial</b> representation and <b>test</b> {{the idea that the}} resolution of the axis depends on object width. A new experimental paradigm was developed to infer sensitivity to position within individual figural regions, using circles as the figural regions. A probe dot was presented within a circle along a diameter at one location in one temporal interval and at a slightly different location on that diameter in a second temporal interval. The observer’s task was to report the direction in which the probe dot had been displaced. Position discrimination thresholds were calculated and compared to two-dot separation discrimination thresholds. Data were obtained for two circle sizes. It was found that positional sensitivity was strongly enhanced {{near the center of the}} circle, and it was enhanced in a scale-dependent way. The results were tested against a scaled medial (core) model and against models assuming no medial representation. The core model was better able to account for the results...|$|R
40|$|The scalene is {{a primary}} {{respiratory}} muscle in humans; however, in dogs, EMG activity recorded from this muscle during inspiration was reported to derive from underlying muscles. In the present studies, origin of the activity in the <b>medial</b> scalene was <b>tested</b> in rabbits, and its distribution was compared with the muscle mechanical advantage. We assessed in anesthetized rabbits the presence of EMG activity in the scalene, sternomastoid, and parasternal intercostal muscles during quiet breathing and under resistive loading, before and after denervation of the scalene and after its additional insulation. At rest, activity was always recorded in the parasternal muscle and in the scalene bundle inserting on the third rib (medial scalene). The majority of this activity disappeared after denervation. In the bundle inserting on the fifth rib (lateral scalene), the activity was inconsistent, and {{a high percentage of}} this activity persisted after denervation but disappeared after insulation from underlying muscle layers. The sternomastoid was always silent. The fractional change in muscle length during passive inflation was then measured. The mean shortening obtained for medial and lateral scalene and parasternal intercostal was 8. 0 ± 0. 7 %, 5. 5 ± 0. 5 %, and 9. 6 ± 0. 1 %, respectively, of the length at functional residual capacity. Sternomastoid muscle length did not change significantly with lung inflation. We conclude that, similar to that shown in humans, respiratory activity arises from scalene muscles in rabbits. This activity is however not uniformly distributed, and a neuromechanical matching of drive is observed, so that the most effective part is also the most active...|$|R
40|$|Changes in {{hamstring}} and quadriceps {{activity are}} well known in individuals with anterior cruciate ligament deficiency (ACLD) to potentially compensate for knee joint instability. However, few studies have explored gastrocnemius activity or its relationship to knee stability. The {{purpose of this study}} was therefore to examine the activation characteristics of medial gastrocnemius (MG) in ACLD subjects and relate any changes to knee joint laxity. Two subject cohorts were assessed: those with unilateral ACLD (n= 15) and uninjured control subjects (n= 11). Surface EMG of the left and right MG were recorded during a controlled single leg hop on each limb. Onset and offset of MG activation relative to take-off, during flight and landing were calculated as well as muscle activity (RMS). Passive antero-posterior knee laxity was measured with a KT 1000 arthrometer during a maximal manual displacement <b>test.</b> <b>Medial</b> gastrocnemius activity on the injured side of ACLD participants demonstrated significantly prolonged activation in preparation to hop, minimal muscle inactivity prior to take-off, and increased duration of overall muscle activity when compared to the uninjured side and control subjects (p< 0. 05). Significant positive correlations were found between passive knee joint laxity and prolonged activation prior to knee bend. RMS of the muscle signal was not significantly different between limbs. Overall, MG on the ACLD side demonstrated longer activation, with minimal rest during the hop test, which may be an attempt to maintain knee stability. Furthermore, the strong relationship between knee laxity and prolonged muscle activation suggests that individuals with a loss of knee stability are more reliant on active control of the gastrocnemius muscle...|$|R

The objective {{of this study is}} to establish the relative strength of fixation of a distal femoral locking plate (DFLP) compared with the dynamic condylar screw (DCS) in the distal femur fractures. Materials and Methods: Study was conducted on 16 freshly harvested cadaveric distal femoral specimens, eight implanted with DCS and other eight with DFLP. The construct was made unstable by removing a standard sized medial wedge of 1 cm base (gap-osteotomy) beginning 6 cm proximal to the lateral joint line in distal metaphyseal region with the loss of <b>medial</b> buttress. Fatigue <b>test</b> was conducted under load control mode at the frequency of I Hz. Specimens were subjected to cyclic loading of 2 kN, under observation for 50, 000 cycles or until failure/cutout, which ever occurred earlier. Results: In DFLP group, there was no implant failure and the average number of cycles sustained was 50, 000. Six out of eight specimens completed 50, 000 cycles and two failed in DCS group. The average number of cycles sustained by DCS was 46150. Though the bone quality as assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry DEXA was comparable in both DFLP and DCS group (P = 0. 06), none failed in DFLP group and subsidence was 1. 02 ± 0. 34 mm (range: 0. 60 - 1. 32 mm), which was significantly 43 % lower (P = 0. 006) than subsidence in DCS group (1. 82 ± 0. 58; range: 1. 20 - 3. 08 mm). The average stiffness of DCS group was 52. 8 ± 4. 2 N/mm, which was significantly lower than average stiffness of locked condylar plate group (71. 2 ± 5. 1 N/mm) (P = 0. 02).

40|$|Background: Frozen {{shoulder}} is {{a condition}} characterized by pain and global restriction of movement with loss of external rotation. Cardiac surgery may predispose frozen shoulder as patients tend to immobilize their upper limbs after surgery. Objectives: The {{aim of this study}} is to analyze the clinical profile of patients presenting with symptoms of periarthritis shoulder and to determine the incidence of frozen shoulder among patients undergoing cardiac surgery as well as to find the factors associated with its development. Methods: It is a clinical observational study done in the Cardiology Department of Chettinad Hospital and Research Institute, Chennai, between August 2015 and May 2016, on 100 patients who underwent cardiac surgery and attended the follow-up session as an outpatient. Data were collected by face-to-face interview using a standardized questionnaire. Respondents presenting with pain and restricted movement of shoulder joint with positive limitation in lateral rotation, abduction, and <b>medial</b> rotation (LAM) <b>test</b> were considered to have frozen shoulder. Each participant was followed up for 3 months postcardiac surgery. Results: The mean age of the study participants was 53. 63 ± 13. 03 years, and 65 % were males. Of the 100 participants, 20 (20 %) developed frozen shoulder. Age (P < 0. 01), diabetes mellitus (< 0. 01), hypertension (P < 0. 001), type of surgery (P < 0. 02), and regularity of physiotherapy follow-up (P < 0. 01) had significant association with positive LAM test on univariate analysis. However, on multivariate logistic regression analysis, only hypertension and physiotherapy regularity were found to have a trend toward a significant independent association with the occurrence of frozen shoulder (P = 0. 090 and 0. 097, respectively). Conclusion: The present study shows that cardiac surgery increases the risk of developing frozen shoulder during the early postoperative period. Statistically significant correlation existed between positive LAM test and age of the patients, presence of diabetes mellitus and hypertension, type of cardiac surgery, and the regularity of physiotherapy follow-up...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} whether medial tenderness is {{a predictor}} of deep deltoid ligament incompetence in supination-external rotation ankle fractures. DESIGN: All Weber B lateral malleolar fractures with normal medial clear space over a 9 month period were prospectively included in the study. Fracture patterns not consistent with a supination-external rotation mechanism were excluded. SETTING: High-volume tertiary care referral center and Level I trauma center. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-five skeletally mature patients with a Weber B lateral malleolar fracture and normal medial clear space presenting to our institution were included. INTERVENTION: All study patients had ankle anteroposterior, lateral, and mortise radiographs. Each patient was seen and evaluated by an orthopedic specialist and the mechanism of injury was recorded. Each patient was assessed for tenderness to palpation {{in the region of}} the deltoid ligament and then had an external rotation stress mortise radiograph. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Correlating medial tenderness with deep deltoid competence as measured by stress radiographs. RESULTS: Thirteen patients (23. 6 %) were tender medially and had a positive external rotation stress radiograph. Thirteen patients (23. 6 %) were tender medially and had a negative external rotation stress radiograph. Nineteen patients (34. 5 %) were nontender medially and had a negative external rotation stress radiograph. Ten patients (18. 2 %) were nontender medially and had a positive external rotation stress radiograph. We calculated a chi statistic of 2. 37 as well as the associated P value of 0. 12. Medial tenderness as a measure of deep deltoid ligament incompetence had a sensitivity of 57 %, a specificity of 59 %, a positive predictive value of 50 %, a negative predictive value of 66 %, and an accuracy of 42 %. CONCLUSION: There was no statistical significance between the presence of medial tenderness and deep deltoid ligament incompetence. There is a 25 % chance of the fracture in question with medial tenderness having a positive external rotation stress and a 25 % chance the fracture with no medial tenderness having a positive stress <b>test.</b> <b>Medial</b> tenderness in a Weber B lateral ankle fracture with a normal clear space on standard plain radiographs does not ensure the presence of a positive external rotation stress test...|$|R

Waninger, FACSM) HISTORY: A 15 -year-old {{high school}} linebacker was {{involved}} in a pile-up after diving for fumbled ball during a junior varsity football game. Athlete remained on the field clutching his left elbow. He described feeling a clunk and the sensation of his arm “popping out”. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Initial on-field observation showed an obvious deformity at the elbow with a noticeably sulcus at distal humerus and prominent olecranon. Palpable point tenderness and observable swelling was evident. Athlete appeared neurologically and vascularly intact. The athlete was splinted and taken off the field by a stretcher. EMS pre-hospital care included pain medication prior to emergency room transport. The athlete was then transported to the hospital for further examination and diagnosis. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: Compartment syndrome UE, Coronoid fracture, Terrible triad (elbow dislocation with radial head and coronoid fracture), Olecranon fracture, Posterolateral rotatory instability, Radial head fracture, Valgus Instability, Distal humerus fracture, Monteggia fracture, <b>Medial</b> Epicondyle fracture <b>TEST</b> AND RESULTS: Initial elbow radiographs included AP, lateral and oblique views. Radiographs were revealed no apparent fracture. Stress films not considered and MRI not warranted at the time of evaluation. Prominent shift of olecranon posteriorly. FINAL/WORKING DIAGNOSIS: Posterior elbow dislocation TREATMENT AND OUTCOMES: After the initial hospital visit, the athlete was splinted in 90 degrees of flexion for 10 days and instructed to use a sling for comfort. Once the splint was removed, he remained in the sling for an additional three days and performed passive elbow motion as tolerated. Physical therapy commenced three times a week and included active/passive range of motion exercises. Cryotherapy and electrical stimulation modalities were administered for pain relief and muscle relaxation. At three weeks post injury, the athlete was permitted to increase exercise routine and was provided home exercise programs (which was performed with the high school’s athletic trainer). Passive extension brace was used 10 minutes/day; four times a day for subsequent 3 - 6 weeks post injury. Athlete did not return to full contact football activities. Five months post-injury the athlete was cleared for return to full activity. Stretching and strengthening, joint mobilization and functional activities continued through rehabilitation process. Pre-injury strength returned prior to spring sports season...|$|R

C 32 Topic: Retrograde messengers: EndocannabinoidsEndocannabinoid (eCB) -mediated {{long-term}} {{depression of}} inhibitory responses (iLTD) {{has emerged as}} a major theme of presynaptic plasticity in the mammalian brain. We hypothesize that eCB regulates the developmental plasticity of GABAergic synapses in the vestibular nucleus via the modulation of iLTD, thereby contributing to spatial recognition. Whole-cell patch-clamp experiments were performed on brainstem slice of postnatal rats. iLTD of GABAA receptor-mediated evoked-IPSCs was induced in 70 % of the <b>medial</b> vestibular neurons <b>tested</b> in P 5 - 7 rats but was reduced to 20 % in P 8 - 17 rats. In P 5 - 7 rats, the proportion of neurons showing iLTD was reduced to 40 % with bath application of AM 251 (antagonist of cannabinoid CB 1 R). Similar results were obtained in P 5 - 7 rats pre-implanted at P 1 with AM 251 -loaded Elvax slice that allows controlled release of the drug into the underlying vestibular nucleus. In normal P 8 - 10 rats, the proportion of neurons showing iLTD was increased to 60 % with bath application of WIN 55 (agonist of CB 1 R). Similar results were obtained in P 8 - 10 rats pre-implanted at P 1 with WIN 55 -loaded Elvax slice. However, the proportion was decreased to 20 % in P 11 - 17 rats pretreated with WIN 55. To determine the receptor that triggers postsynaptic production and release of eCB, we applied to the bath antagonist/agonist of either Group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) or serotonin receptor (5 -HTR). When compared with the control, antagonist/agonist of Group I mGluR exerted no effect on iLTD induction. However, 5 -HTR agonist increased the proportion of neurons expressing iLTD in P 8 - 10 rats while 5 -HTR antagonist decreased the proportion in P 5 - 7 rats, suggesting that 5 -HTR is involved in triggering eCB release from vestibular neurons. To attest the effects of eCB in the expression of vestibular behavior, rats pre-implanted at P 1 with AM 251 - or WIN 55 -loaded Elvax were tested with negative geotaxis, a behavioral indicator of gravity-detection. When compared with normal rats which acquire the re-orienting behavior by P 7, emergence of negative geotaxis was accelerated to P 5 in AM 251 -treated rats but was delayed to P 9 in WIN 55 -treated rats. Similar accelerated and delayed emergence of negative geotaxis was observed in rats pretreated with GABAA receptor agonist (muscimol) and antagonist (bicuculline) respectively. Our results therefore indicate that eCB plays an age-dependent role in modulating the efficacy of GABAergic synapses in the vestibular nucleus, thereby regulating activities of neural network responsible for the expression of gravity-detection behavio...|$|R
