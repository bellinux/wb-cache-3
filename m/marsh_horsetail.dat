50|$|Equisetum palustre, the <b>marsh</b> <b>horsetail,</b> is a {{plant species}} {{belonging}} to the division of horsetails (Equisetopsida). It is widespread in cooler regions of North America and Eurasia.|$|E
50|$|The water {{horsetail}} {{is most often}} confused with the <b>marsh</b> <b>horsetail</b> E. palustre, which has rougher stems with fewer (4-8) stem ridges with a smaller hollow in the stem centre, and longer spore cones 2-4 cm long.|$|E
50|$|The spores are borne under sporangiophores in strobili, cone-like {{structures}} at {{the tips}} {{of some of the}} stems. In many species the cone-bearing shoots are unbranched, and in some (e.g. field horsetail, E. arvense) they are non-photosynthetic, produced early in spring. In some other species (e.g. <b>marsh</b> <b>horsetail,</b> E. palustre) they are very similar to sterile shoots, photosynthetic and with whorls of branches.|$|E
50|$|The spores {{are spread}} {{by the wind}} (anemochory) and have four long ribbon-like {{structures}} attached to them. They sit on strobili which are rounded on the top. <b>Marsh</b> <b>Horsetails</b> often form subterranean runners and tubers, with which they also can proliferate vegetatively.|$|R
50|$|The Upper Lake {{is part of}} the Wicklow Mountains National Park. Among {{the plants}} living near the coast can be cited the white waterlily and the {{broad-leaved}} pondweed. Some of its shore is occupied by a <b>marsh</b> with <b>horsetail,</b> bottle sedge and common reed, which is a convenient place to spot dragonflies.|$|R
50|$|Freshwater marshes {{exist in}} many places around the shore but {{extensive}} reed-beds stretching out into the lake are rare. The margins of the marshes are mostly sedge dominated by such species as bottle sedge, bladder-sedge, tufted-sedge, common-sedge and occasionally water-sedge, water <b>horsetail,</b> <b>marsh</b> cinquefoil and bur-reeds also occur commonly. Also on the fringes occurs a more varied community characteristic of base-poor areas, with such species as marsh ragwort, lesser spearwort, devils-bit scaboius, marsh bedstraw and hoary willowherb, creeping bent, sweet vernal-grass, Yorkshire fog and purple moor-grass. Cuckooflower occurs commonly and bog violet and greater spearwort {{are to be found}} in places.|$|R
50|$|The site is {{a meadow}} beside the River Chess. It {{is an example of}} damp {{grassland}} which has been traditionally managed for grazing. There are also areas of swamp and marsh. The main plants in grassland areas include sweet vernal grass and meadow foxtail, and <b>marsh</b> <b>horsetail</b> and common spike-rush are common in damper areas. The site has hedgehogs and a wide variety of wetland birds and invertebrates.|$|E
5000|$|The Meadows {{provide a}} window on the medieval world, never having been intensively farmed. They {{are one of the few}} {{remaining}} examples of unimproved wet alluvial grassland in Greater London and the Colne Valley. The linear features, river, embankment, ditches and hedges, contribute to the rich diversity of plants and animals. Cows and horses graze in order to improve conditions by churning up the ground and encouraging pooling of water. Mammals on site include the nationally endangered water vole, and there are birds such as snipe, cuckoos and a barn owl. Plants include <b>marsh</b> <b>horsetail,</b> ragged robin and arrowhead.|$|E
50|$|In the {{community}} {{in the western part}} of the mire, Blunt-flowered Rush, Purple Moor-grass (Molinia caerulea) and Carnation Sedge (Carex panicea) are abundant species, and this part of the mire is characterised by the presence of a number of species which favour base-rich conditions. Black Bog-rush is locally abundant along a wet drainage ditch in this western part of the site. In the eastern part of the mire Purple Moor-grass and Blunt-flowered Rush are again abundant, but the abundant sedge species here are Lesser Pond-sedge (Carex acutiformis) and Greater Pond-sedge (Carex riparia). Common Reed (Phragmites australis) and <b>Marsh</b> <b>Horsetail</b> (Equisetum palustre) are also frequent. This part of the site supports plant species associated with more neutral conditions.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Alkaloids, {{nitrogen-containing}} secondary plant metabolites, are {{of major}} interest to veterinary toxicology {{because of their}} occurrence in plant species commonly involved in animal poisoning. Based on epidemiological data, the poisoning of cattle and horses by alkaloid-containing plants is a relatively common occurrence in Europe. Poisoning may occur when the plants contaminate hay or silage or when forage alternatives are unavailable. Cattle and horses are particularly at risk of poisoning by Colchicum autumnale (meadow saffron), Conium maculatum (poison hemlock), Datura stramonium (jimson weed), Equisetum palustre (<b>marsh</b> <b>horsetail),</b> Senecio spp. (ragwort and groundsel) and Taxus baccata (European yew). This review of poisonous alkaloid-containing plants describes the distribution of these plants, conditions under which poisoning occurs, active toxic principles involved and subsequent clinical signs observed...|$|E
