2500|$|In {{the second}} half the nineteenth century, a {{tradition}} of musical paintings began to appear that influenced symbolist painters (Campen 2007, Van Uitert 1978). In {{the first decades of}} the twentieth century, a German artist group called The Blue Rider (Der Blaue Reiter) executed synesthetic experiments that involved a composite group of painters, composers, dancers and theater producers. The group focused on the unification of the arts by means of [...] "Total Works of Art" [...] (Gesamtkunstwerk) (Von Maur 2001, Hahl-Koch 1985, Ione 2004). Kandinsky's theory of synesthesia, as formulated in the booklet [...] "Concerning the Spiritual in Art" [...] (1910), helped to shape the ground for these experiments. He described synesthesia as a phenomenon of transposition of experience from one sense modality to another, as in unisonous musical tones (Kandinsky 1910, Düchting 1996). Kandinsky was not the only artist at this time with an interest in synesthetic perception. A study of the art at the turn of the century reveals in the work of almost every progressive or avant-garde artist an interest in the correspondences of music and visual art. Modern artists experimented with <b>multi-sensory</b> <b>perception</b> like the simultaneous perception of movement in music and film (Von Maur 2001, Heyrman 2003).|$|E

40|$|This paper extends {{recent work}} in {{interactive}} machine learning (IML) focused on effectively incorporating human feedback. We show how control and feedback signals {{complement each other}} in systems which model human reward. We demonstrate that simultaneously incorporating human control and feedback signals can improve interactive robotic systems' performance on a self-mirrored movement control task where an RL-agent controlled right arm attempts to match the preprogrammed movement pattern of the left arm. We illustrate the impact of varying human feedback parameters on task performance by investigating the probability of giving feedback on each time step {{and the likelihood of}} given feedback being correct. We further illustrate that varying the temporal decay with which the agent incorporates human feedback has a significant impact on task performance. We found that smearing human feedback over time steps improves performance and we show varying the probability of feedback at each time step, and an increased likelihood of those feedbacks being 'correct' can impact agent performance. We conclude that understanding latent variables in human feedback is crucial for learning algorithms acting in human-machine interaction domains.

40|$|Vertebrates {{evolved in}} the Cambrian Period before 520 million years ago, {{but we do not}} know when or how {{consciousness}} arose {{in the history of the}} vertebrate brain. Here we propose multiple levels of isomorphic or somatotopic neural representations as an objective marker for sensory consciousness. All extant vertebrates have these, so we deduce that consciousness extends back to the group’s origin. The first conscious sense may have been vision. Then vision, coupled with additional sensory systems derived from ectodermal placodes and neural crest, transformed primitive reflexive systems into image forming brains that map and perceive the external world and the body’s interior. We posit that the minimum requirement for sensory consciousness and qualia is a brain including a forebrain (but not necessarily a developed cerebral cortex/pallium), midbrain and hindbrain. This brain must also have 1) hierarchical systems of intercommunicating, isomorphically organized, processing nuclei that extensively integrate the different senses into representations that emerge in upper levels of the neural hierarchy; and 2) a widespread reticular formation that integrates the sensory inputs and contributes to attention, awareness, and neural synchronization. We propose a two-step evolutionary history, in which the optic tectum was the original center of <b>multi-sensory</b> conscious <b>perception</b> (as in fish and amphibians: step 1), followed by a gradual shift of this center to the dorsal pallium or its cerebral cortex (in mammals, reptiles, birds: step 2). We address objections to the hypothesis and call for more studies of fish and amphibians. In our view, the lamprey has all the neural requisites and is likely the simplest extant vertebrate with sensory consciousness and qualia. Genes that pattern the proposed elements of consciousness (isomorphism, neural crest, placodes) have been identified in all vertebrates. Thus, consciousness is in the genes, some of which are already known...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Multisensory {{interactions}} between haptics and vision remain poorly understood. Previous {{studies have shown}} that shapes, such as letters of the alphabet, when drawn on the skin, are differently perceived dependent upon which body part is stimulated and on how the stim-ulated body part, such as the hand, is positioned. Another line of research within this area has investigated <b>multi-sensory</b> interactions. Tactile <b>perceptions,</b> for example, have the potential to disambiguate visually perceived informa-tion. While the former studies focused on explicit reports about tactile perception, the latter studies relied on fully aligned multisensory stimulus dimensions. In this study, we investigated to what extent rotating tactile stimulations on the hand affect directional visual motion judgments implicitly and without any spatial stimulus alignment. We show that directional tactile cues and ambiguous visual motion cues are integrated, thus biasing the judgment of visually perceived motion. We further show that the direction of the tactile influence depends on the position and orientation of the stimulated part of the hand relative to a head-centered frame of reference. Finally, we also show that the time course of the cue integration is very versatile. Overall, the results imply immediate directional cue inte-gration within a head-centered frame of reference...|$|R

40|$|My work {{focuses on}} the senses that {{we take for granted}} when we {{experience}} art. We often disregard how our bodies work in relation to living our daily lives. In my piece, the Mechanics of Interaction, I highlight the experience of intertwined senses, in particular sight, touch, and sound. My thesis sculpture, the Mechanics of Interaction, is based on an attempt to avoid a purely visual experience of art. I try to redirect the audience away from the hierarchy of senses where sight is privileged. Many artworks tend to accentuate the combination of vision and thought as an 2 ̆ 2 expression. 2 ̆ 2 Sight plays a dominant role in the world of art. I see this dominance as problematic. I also believe that the connection between seeing and thinking is a concept within Western culture that allows one to connect vision with intellect. In my piece, I try to push the other senses in the domain of thought [...] a kind of thinking with the body. Instead of accentuating the mind/sight relationship, I align the other senses with the experience of art, where one sense does not dominate the others. The mechanical nature of my work allows the audience to approach it not only as an object to look at, but as an object to interact with physically.

40|$|The primary {{argument}} {{of this study}} is that the medium of anime and manga, Japanese cartoons and comics, has the potential to offer a new perspective on the representation of architectural space. This might come as a surprise due to a preconceived notion that cartoons and comics are an immature art form without any value outside of the entertainment realm. Hence it is the goal of this dissertation to reveal how the methodology of manga, in particular, has the ability to enhance architectural representations in terms of the <b>multi-sensory</b> and space-time <b>perception</b> of architecture through characteristics of manga, such as narrative, portrayal of the invisible realm and the expression of both space and time by panel arrangements. To do this, a foundation with the beginnings, development, and basic visual vocabulary and grammar of comics is described and compared to other art forms. Through this comparison, the communicative power of comics is assessed by its combination of picture and word, ability to make visible the invisible through iconic images, and closure, which creates sequencing and narrative. Next, a comparison is made to show how manga is unique and visually distinctive from Western comics. Manga is found to make more use of the “masking” effect, aspectto- aspect and moment-to-moment panel transitions, length, hyper-stylization, and minimalist art. In order to argue that these manga differences have a better relationship in representing architectural space, important characteristics of architectural space are identified. These characteristics are the built environments presence in a multi-sensory world, space-time, and its association with experiential and lived space. These are then examined in relationship to the ability manga methodology has in representing these three characteristics. Finally, manga is compared to the current methods of representing architectural space such as conventional architectural drawings and writings, 3 d architectural animations, virtual reality, and film. It can be concluded that manga is a more complete way of representing architectural space. As a demonstration of this, a sample manga that focuses on one particular area in Tokyo, Ikebukuro, is drawn to illustrate how this method can work utilizing the characteristics of manga, such as narrative, portrayal of the invisible realm and expression of both space and time by panel arrangements...|$|R
40|$|It’s in {{the medical}} an {{physiological}} research field that in XVIIIth century France the most interesting solutions concerning sight perception and its spin-off for philosophy have been presented. As for life sciences, it’s up to philosophers to define the theoretical coordinates providing a sense for the experimental study. Anyway, it’s in early XVIIth century that the connection between optics, physics and philosophy achieves its better results, results which are the object of our analysis – from Keplero to Gassendi and Berkeley – {{in view of the}} turning point represented by XVIIIth century biological theories developed by Georges-Louis Leclerc de Buffon, Julien Offroy de La Mettrie and Denis Diderot. From the ancient times to modern age, the old question about the condition for human understanding, the function of sight perception and its cognitive significance – a part from the well restricted world of philosophy – concern competences of interdisciplinary value that are the main topic the debate about the origins of knowledge developed in XVIIth and XVIIIth centuries focused on in the wake of Keplero’s theory (Paralipomena ad Vitellionem) first, and, later on, of Descartes’ (Discours de la méthode e Dioptrique) and Locke’s famous achievement in Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690) referring to the so called «Molyneux’s question». It is a matter dealing both with physiology and medicine chiefly rather than with philosophy. The example of the born blind man who, once had his sight regained, tries to recognize, through the simple act of naming, the objects previously experienced and known only through his touch belongs to a very old tradition. A twenty-five centuries old tradition, «twenty-five centuries of research and experiment concerning how sight works» (A. De Cola), during which the experience of blindness and <b>multi-sensory</b> sight <b>perception</b> played a not secondary part, paving the way to the development of lively debates about the nature of human mind in relation to sense organs. The XVIIIth century represents the link between the ancient and the modern theories dealing with the question of sight, knowledge and its legitimacy for the achievement of sensible truth. According to the Ancients, knowledge – since Aristotle’s Book A in Metaphysics where sight is celebrated as the knowledge sense – is based on the direct view of things and on a substantialistic concept of the act of viewing, traditionally deriving from the different metaphysical conceptions of reality developed from time to time (from Greeks to Arabs) and, accordingly, from the Weltanschauungen they gave rise. As far as the mechanics in medicine field is concerned, for pre-modern scholars studying how sight work means investigate the eye functions (and crystalline functions) with reference to the different species of things. Sight and knowledge are both strictly connected to another reality, an upper level reality, that transcends and stands for their cause. After Keplero and Descartes, modern speculation focuses on the cognitive processes and on the functions of the mind, spirit and soul, throughout the investigation, in the viewing experience, of real, material basis of subjectivity, namely the different ways subjectivity materially develops (memory, imagination, will, passions, desire etc.). The key-concepts paving the way to investigation, from Keplero and Descartes to Diderot and La Mettrie, are a) pictura (the material image reflecting on the eye ground) and b) imago (the rational entity human mind has to understand and interpret). As far as the mechanics in medicine field is concerned, in XVIIth and XVIIIth centuries, studying the sight work means investigate the connection between the eye, its physico-physiological phantasmata (Hobbes) and the mind. The Enlightenment is the age when the crux of this threefold question, concerning the connection between sight/perception/cognition – on the background of the post-cartesian modern theories of knowledge, from the empirical, philosophical, aesthetical perspective to the XVIIIth century medical and language theory - urges to be solved. So, it’s in Molyneux’ question that a synthesis of the most striking and different solutions proposed by philosophers, Diderot and Kant included, to the problem of knowledge and its connections with sensitivity can be found...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe develop on a {{model for}} multi-sensory {{integration}} to perform sensorimotor tasks. The aim of the model is to provide missing modality recall and generalization using cortico-inspired mechanisms. The architecture consists in several multilevel cortical maps with a generic structure. Each map has to self organize with a continuous, decentralized and unsupervised learning which provides robustness and adaptability. These self-organizations are constrained by the multi modal context to obtain multi-sensory generalization. More precisely, each modality is represented by a perceptive map and each perception by an activity bump, that emerges thanks to a competition mechanism, in the corresponding map. All perceptive maps are reciprocally and laterally connected to an unique associative map. A competition {{takes place in the}} associative map to generate an activity bump which represents the <b>multi-sensory</b> <b>perception.</b> Multi modal constraints are relaxed, thanks to the lateral connections, to converge towards coherent perceptions within a multi modal context. We will present a model of perceptive map using a modulated BCM (Bienenstock Cooper Munro) learning rule to create a self-organization at the map level, which can be influenced by the multimodal context. An unlearning mechanism adds robustness and plasticity to the architecture and makes the self-organization smoother...|$|E

Skoncentrowanie badaczy na wybranych zjawiskach krótkotrwałych uniemożliwia kompleksowe spojrzenie na badany krajobraz. Tymczasem krajobrazy efemeryczne percypowane są całościowo i mogą stanowić ważną atrakcję turystyczną. Although the {{relations}} between landscape and certain human activities are well recognised in landscape ecology literature, main emphasis is put on stable landscape features. This article, by contrast, focuses on ephemeral landscapes which are defined as the ones consisted of phenomena and features of a changeable character (Brassley 1998). It can be assumed that the phenomena, even of same type, construct a different ephemeral landscape each time. However, despite their evanescence and irregular occurrence (Palang et al. 2007), they {{still need to be}} investigated due to their significant role in perception of the whole landscape and its evaluation for different functions (Brassley 1998). The article also refers to substantial theoretical connotations of landscape ephemera and <b>multi-sensory</b> model of <b>perception.</b> The link can be easily recognised in tourism management because a complexity of several landscape ephemera’s features strongly influences visitor preferences of certain regions (Huang 2013). Due to stated selective and superficial recognition of the problem, authors’ main aim was to propose a novel typology of natural-caused landscape ephemera based on a detailed literature review. in the typology, the visually dominant genetic factor criterion was used. Therefore, there were distinguished landscape ephemera mainly connected with: (1) astronomical factors, (2) weather conditions, (3) endogenic, (4) geomorphologic, (5) hydrological processes, (6) biological and (7) joint ephemeral factors (tab. 1). The typology also reflects different economic and social roles of landscapes assigned to particular groups – e. g. astronomical phenomena, due to their relatively higher predictability, can constitute a core of specific tourist products, while endogenic ones are often perceived as a danger and disruption of a trip (Yang et al. 2008). The authors confirmed considerable inequality in a recognition degree of landscape ephemera of different types. Symptomatically, {{there are only a few}} works which present an issue in a complex way. The stress is often put on the short-lasting phenomena itself while there are some durable processes (e. g. aeolian) which can also subconstruct certain landscape ephemera (e. g. ripplemarks). Undoubtedly, there are still many cognitive gaps connected with presented subject which are strongly needed to be filled because of its potential applied role. An influence of landscape ephemera on creating local identity and resident’s embeddedness is of an example...|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2012 Mimarlık; çevresel etkenler,toplumsal unsurlar, kültürel birikim, düşünsel ürünler ve bilimsel bilgi gibi birçok bileşenin farklı oranlardaki katkı ve şekillendirmeleri doğrultusunda somut ürünler ve düşünsel yaklaşımlar ortaya koyan çok girdili bir disiplindir. Dolayısıyla mimarlık üzerine fikir yürütülürken sadece mimarlığa dair teori ya da uygulama temelli bir tartışma konusu tayin edebilmek ve bu konu üzerinden düşünsel sonuçlara ulaşmak mümkün değildir. Bu noktada insan bilinci ile mimarlık ürünü arasındaki ilişkiyi şekillendiren unsurlar olarak duyular, zamanın değişenlerinden bağımsız bir araştırma konusu olarak belirmektedirler. Duyusal bilginin oluşturulma ve ele alınış yöntemleri, bu yaklaşımların arkalarındaki düşünceler, farklı zamanların farklı mimarlıkları üzerinden mimarlığın değişen ve değişmeyen bileşenlerinin farkedilebilmesini sağlayan önemli bir çalışma konusudur. Çalışma dahilinde iki önemli bilimsel eşik noktası ve bu iki eşik noktası arasındaki süreç, duyusal mimarlık bilgisine dair oluşturulan farklı bilgi ve yaklaşımlar üzerinden irdelenecektir. Aydınlanma devrinde yeniden şekillenen bilgisel sınıflandırmalar ve sanayileşmenin sağladığı teknik olanaklar doğrultusunda oluşan modern mimarlık hareketi, belirtilen değişikliklerin toplumların yaşantıları üzerindeki güçlü etkilerine dair yeni ve akılcı çözümler sunma iddiasında olmuştur. Bu hareketin çıkış noktası olan akılcılık ilkesiyle bir çelişki teşkil edecek şekilde kuramsallaştırılan duyu bilgileri ise mimarlığın ikili bilgi yapısını ve kişisel irade boyutunu gözler önüne sermektedir. 2. Dünya Savaşı’nın ardından büyüyen kentleşme ve yeniden yapılanma sorunları; yönetim odaklarının, bilimsel ve ampirik fiziksel çevre çalışmalarını kişiselleştirilmiş mimarlık bilgilerine tercih etmesiyle çözümlenmeye çalışılmıştır. Kentsel yaşama koşullarında iyileştirme ve sıfırdan inşa edilen çevrelerin tarafsız bilgilerle oluşturma çabaları, 20. Yüzyıl kentlerinin çehrelerini şekillendiren en büyük unsur olmuştur. Bu devir,kamu yapılarındaki cephe açıklıklarını tayin eden gerekli ışık değerlerinden, yolların güzergah ve yoğunluklarını etkileyecek işitsel komfor bilgilerine kadar pek çok noktada farklı mimarlık bilgilerinin üretilmesine sahne olmuştur. Bu bilginin üretilme şeklindeki akılcı tavır modern mimarlığın araçsalcılığından farklıdır ve kendi çelişkilerini barındırır. Laboratuarların sınırlarını reddeden bilim insanları, insanların düşünce, plan ve duygularını dışlayan duyusal komfor arayışlarıyla bir anlamda laboratuarları kentlere taşımışlardır. Kuantum anlayışının baskın bilimsel görüş olarak kabul görmesiyle birlikte davranış ve fiziksel çevre üzerinden ilerleyen duyusal bilgi çalışmaları daha öğesel, bütüncül ve çok disiplinli bir çalışma alanına dönüşmüştür. İnsanın bütüncül duyu örgüsünün ayırdındaki bilimsel bilgi, çok duyulu etkileşimleri gündelik hayata taşımakta ve mimarlığı, görsel etkiyi aşan, bütün duyusal verileri önemseyen çok disiplinli bir üretim eylemi olmaya doğru götürmektedir. Architecture is a {{multiple}} inputted discipline that creates solid objects and ideologic approaches, meanwhile being directly effected from various crucial {{elements such as}} the cultural heritage, social contents, philosophical ideas and the scientific knowledge. This multiple informationary causes and effetcs prevent architecture from being a certain subject to be discussed in an isolated manor with concrete results. At that point, the senses which build the perceptional bridge between the human consciousness and the architectural product becomes an invariable {{that is to be}} an objective field of study for the architecture. The derivation of the sensory information, the way architects aproach to it and the ideas behind these actions help revealing the variable and the invariables of the architecture through different times. The study includes two sequential paradigmic shifts in scientific knowledge and the period between those shifts. Those three differing periods will be considered through different architectural sensory informations and approaches. First period starts with the seperation of the natural Sciences and philosophy. This major informational change revealed itself in architecture {{by the end of the}} 19 th century. Modernist architecture was born out of two major things. The enlightenment that revolutionized and reshaped the structure of the knowledge and the industralization of the production force. Modernist architecture proposed new solutions to the masses that were massively effected from the rapidly changing artificial environments that were created out of mass productions. Those solutions were based on rationalization. But the major conflict created out of this rationalization principle can be observed through the instrumentalized sensory informations created by the modernist architects which are heavily customized yet manifested to be universal. This reveals the duality of the architectural knowledge. One of the most significant examples of this attempt was Le Corbusier s life long works and writings. The architect tried to catalogue all the assumed definitions and dimensions needed for the daily architectural practice in a theorotical manor in his compilation books named Le Modulor. The ideas documented on those writings were partly realized through most of Le Corbusier s works. The dualistic and blurry properties of architectural knowledge that do not change over time are revealed as a conflict throughought the works of Le Corbusier and most significantly on his religious buildings. The idea of a religious building includes the symbolism of the religion and the traditions it holds within it s very programme. The modernist approach Le Corbusier advocated cherished the symbolism of the natural material, the plan and the shapes that were created throughout the particular projects rather than a constant symbolism. The instrumentalized sensory informations derived for the building of La Tourette shows the conflict created out of the modernist approach significantly. La Modular principles applied to the meditation chambers of the monastery seem to work well yet the same proportions applied to more daily functioning spaces crated rather questionable results in other buildings of the architect. Thus the outer facades of La Tourette were not created for any apparent functional reason. Those facades that were based on a geometrical system which was derived out of Xenakis s musical composition Metastasis. Seemingly architects favored the mathematical order through both vision and hearing sensories. While this approach can be explained through an arithmetical logic, it cannot be explained with any logical reason as the modernist architecture manifested. The subjectively idealized arithmetic instruments were used for creating different sensory results. This approach can be traced back to the enlightenment era. The idea of Musica Universalis which was dominant throuought Pythagoreans in ancient Greece was revived in the 17 th century. This ideology foretold that the roots of all nature were derived out of Mathemeatics. Mathematics can explain the mechanisms of any natural phenomenon regardless of the sensory results. This large order of natural explanation can be seen through La Tourette despite the subjective modifications of the architect. The rationalizating of one of the most important modernist architectural method thus reveals it self to be subjective and idealized. Second period starts with the early 20 th century s mass building programmes and the behaviorist environment approach. The problems of reconstruction and the urbanization of the man-made environments were evermore increased by the end of the Second World War. The governing forces preferred the emprical scientific knowledge derived out of physical environment to the customized architectural manifests. The work of (re) constructing the urban environment with the help of the emprical knowledge was the major force that shaped the faces of today’s urban environments and also the improvements of the poorly conditioned industrial cities of the Europe and the Americas. From the light examinings that led to the definitions of the opacity proportions on the outer surfaces of the public buildings, to the noise control experiments that helped the shaping of the roads and their densities, this period of time is full of emprical sensory information created by the physical environment scientists. The rationalization behind this act was far different and more objective than the modernist movement yet it had it’s own conflicts. The Scientists that refused the boundaries of the laboratories, seemed to be carrying the idea of the laboratory to the urban environment with the denial of the human realities such as imagination, emotion, plans and intentions in defining the sensory comforts of a building. The behavorist psychological approach of the era tried to create other architectural catalogues regarding the experiments carried out testing the sensory capabilities of the people. The famous Hawthorne Experiments which were carried out after the big deppression in search for greater profits first started the improvements of the physical environments through psychological knowledge. The examining of the physical environment through scientific knowledge and methods started to define the minimum sensory conditions of the industrial environments effecting the governing policies of the mass rebuilding programmes. But the design knowledge that was to be created by the scientists seemed to be even more ineffective than the scientific knowledge tried to be created by the architects in the early 20 th century. The solidified and inorganic artifical environments, from this age on became a majour focus for both the opposing psychologists and philosophers which helped the architectural theory mature and free from the individual building manifests and extremely rational behaviorist experiments. The third period includes the quantum thus the cognitive revolution. With the arising quantum physics, the psychological approach that depended on behavior was ultimately replaced by the cognitive sciences that worked in a multidisciplinary way. The human consciousness is now regarded to be an objective scientific study field. This important paradigmic shift in psychology led to the understanding of the multisensory nature of the human perception. The uniqueness of a spatial experiment can now be explained through the unitary perceptional mechanisms of the human mind scientificaly. This revolutionary new understanding of the human perception helps the questioning of the purely empirical methods of the behaviorist approaches towards the artificial environments. Today’s cognitive scientists think of the multi-sensory interactions and environments as a crucial instrument for the treatment of the mentally and perceptionally challenged people. The technology created for these special environments are also applied to the daily artifical environments of ordinary urban people. Another rather theorotical approval for the <b>multi-sensory</b> <b>perceptions</b> of the human nature can be seen through Peter Zumthor’s buildings. Zumthor buildings tend to favor the unique spatial experience over the construction methods and the programmes. This approach gives his buildings almost synesthetic qualities in perceptional terms. While Zumthor buildings are not directly inspired by the cognitive revolutions of the recent scientific discoveries, they cherish the importance of the whole perceptional mechanisms of the human nature in search for unique spatial experiences. The existence of the mentioned recent archtectural approaches show us that the architecture of the tomorrow will blend the individual preferences with the universal scientific knowledge in unique occurences. This search of architecture will not be properly mentioned in terms of visual aesthetics since it will be in touch with all human senses. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
40|$|A key {{goal for}} the perceptual system is to optimally combine {{information}} from all the senses that may be available {{in order to develop}} the most accurate and unified picture possible of the outside world. The contemporary theoretical framework of ideal observer maximum likelihood integration (MLI) has been highly successful in modelling how the human brain combines information from a variety of different sensory modalities. However, in various recent experiments involving multisensory stimuli of uncertain correspondence, MLI breaks down as a successful model of sensory combination. Within the paradigm of direct stimulus estimation, perceptual models which use Bayesian inference to resolve correspondence have recently been shown to generalize successfully to these cases where MLI fails. This approach has been known variously as model inference, causal inference or structure inference. In this paper, we examine causal uncertainty in another important class of <b>multi-sensory</b> <b>perception</b> paradigm – that of oddity detection and demonstrate how a Bayesian ideal observer also treats oddity detection as a structure inference problem. We validate this approach by showing that it provides an intuitive and quantitative explanation of an important pair of multi-sensory oddity detection experiments – involving cues across and within modalities – for which MLI previously failed dramatically, allowing a novel unifying treatment of within and cross modal multisensory perception. Our successful application of structure inference models to the new ‘oddity detection ’ paradigm, and the resultant unified explanation of across and within modality cases provid...|$|E

This work aims to realize an innovative system of digital exploitation of artefacts in the National Archaeological Museum of Marche (MANaM), {{in order to}} create a shared museum that will improve the knowledge of cultural contents through the paradigm "learning by interacting" and “edutainment”. The main novelty is the implementation of stand-alone multimedia installations for digital artefacts that combine real and virtual scenarios in order to enrich the experience, the knowledge and the <b>multi-sensory</b> <b>perception.</b> A Digital Library (DL) is created using Close Range Photogrammetry (CRP) techniques applied to 21 archaeological artefacts belonging to different categories. Enriched with other data (texts, images, multimedia), all 3 D models flow into the cloud data server from which are recalled in the individual exhibitions. In particular, we have chosen three types of technological solutions: VISUAL, TACTILE, SPATIAL. All the solutions take into account the possibility of group interaction, allowing the participation of the interaction to an appropriate number of users. Sharing the experience enables greater involvement, generating communicative effectiveness much higher than it would get from a lonely visit. From the “Museum Visitors Behaviour Analysis” we obtain a survey about users’ needs and efficiency of the interactive solutions. The main result of this work is the educational impact in terms of increase in visitors, specially students, learning increase of historical and cultural content, greater user involvement during the visit to the museum...|$|E
40|$|Background and purpose: Vision {{has been}} {{considered}} as the dominant modality in the human <b>multi-sensory</b> <b>perception</b> of the surroundings. The congenitally blind individuals use cortical areas that are normally reserved for vision during Braille reading. Use-dependent reorganization and neural plasticity changes occur {{as a consequence of}} many events, including the normal development and maturation of the organism, the acquisition of new skills. The research was designed to study the effect of blindness on SEPs in the dominant hand (Braille reading hand) compared to the non dominant (non Braille reading hand) in the congenitally blind. Material and methods: SEPs were recorded in 15 Braille reading congenitally blind females and compared with 15 age matched normal sighted females following right and left index finger stimulation. Latency and amplitudes of SEP waveforms (N 9, N 13, and N 20) were measured. Results: The SEP-N 20 amplitude was significantly increased in the congenitally blind (p < 0. 0001 for right index finger and p < 0. 005 for left index finger). There is a very large effect of blindness (3. 11) on right index finger. Conclusions: The congenitally blind individuals have larger N 20 amplitude, which is suggestive of greater somatosensory cortical activity. Effect of blindness and Braille reading skills is greater on SEPs recorded from the dominant and preferred hand. A varied contribution from Basic mechanisms in plasticity like neurogenesis, activity-dependent synaptic and neuronal plasticity may be involved...|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{that test}} perceptual illusions and {{movement}} perception have relied predominantly on observing participant response to screen-based phenomena. There {{are a number}} of inherent problems to this experimental method as it involves flicker, ignores depth perception and bypasses the proprioceptive system, in short it is psychophysically distinct from dynamic real life (veridical) perception. Indeed there still is much disagreement regarding perception of apparent (screen- based) motion despite the fact that we view it in a myriad of ways on an everyday basis. With the aim of furthering our understanding and evaluation of veridical movement perception, the team sought to develop a replicable technique that included embodied, <b>multi-sensory</b> <b>perception</b> but eliminated the screen. They approached this by taking time-based techniques from animation and converting them to the spatial; grouping static objects according to Gestalt principles, to create sequential visual cues that, when lit with projected light, demand selective attention. This novel technique has been called the 'diasynchronic' technique and the system; the 'Diasynchronoscope'. The name Diasynchronoscope comes from combining diachronic, (the study of a phenomenon as it changes through time) with synchronous and scope (view). In being so named, it evokes the early animation simulators such as the phenakistoscope and the zoetrope, regarded as direct ancestors of the project in acting both as art objects and experimental media. This paper documents the creation of this new, experimental medium in choreographed time and discusses its potential as a novel tool for investigating aesthetics in movement...|$|E
40|$|The {{construct}} of absorption (effortless engagement) {{has been the}} subject of a small number of disciplinespecific studies of involvement, including music. This paper reports the results of an empirical project that compared psychological qualities of absorption in everyday music listening scenarios with characteristics of non-music-related involvement. Absorption was located in “real-world” settings, and experiences across different activities in a variety of contexts were tapped as soon as possible after they occurred. The inquiry was designed to test two assumptions that have underpinned previous absorption research: first, that certain activities are inherently particularly absorbing; second, that absorption is best conceptualized primarily as a trait as opposed to a state. Twenty participants kept diaries for two weeks, recording descriptions of involving experiences of any kind. Eight weeks after submitting descriptive reports they completed the Modified Tellegen Absorption Scale (Jamieson, 2005). Diaries indicated that different activities shared a subset of involving features, and confirmed the importance of <b>multi-sensory</b> <b>perception</b> and the imaginative faculty to absorbed experiences. Music may be a particularly effective agent in the facilitation of absorption because it affords multiple potential entry points to involvement (acoustic attributes, source specification, entrainment, emotion, fusion of modalities) and because its semantic malleability makes it adaptable to a variety of circumstances. The MODTAS provided insufficient evidence for establishing correlations between state and trait absorption. It is argued that state and trait divisions are constructs that are inherently problematic...|$|E
40|$|Virtual environments {{are playing}} an {{increasingly}} important role for training people about real world situations, especially {{through the use of}} serious games. A key concern is thus the level of realism that virtual environments require in order to have an accurate match of what the user can expect in the real world with what they perceive in the virtual one. Failure to achieve the right level of realism runs the real risk that the user may adopt a different reaction strategy in the virtual world than would be desired in reality. High-fidelity, physically-based rendering has the potential to deliver the same perceptual quality of an image as if you were "there" in the real world scene being portrayed. However, our perception of an environment is not only what we see, but may be significantly influenced by other sensory inputs, including sound, smell, feel, and even taste. Computation and delivery of all sensory stimuli at interactive rates is a computationally complex problem. To achieve true physical accuracy for each of the senses individually for any complex scene in real-time is simply beyond the ability of current standard desktop computers. This paper discusses how human perception, and in particular any cross-modal effects in <b>multi-sensory</b> <b>perception,</b> can be exploited to selectively deliver high-fidelity virtual environments. Selective delivery enables those parts of a scene which the user is attending to, to be computed in high quality. The remainder of the scene is delivered in lower quality, at a significantly reduced computational cost, without the user being aware of this quality difference...|$|E
40|$|Pregnancy {{abdominal}} examination is {{a hallmark}} of midwifery practice that requires considerable dexterity to master. The realities of becoming competent in this routine midwifery practice are elusive in the midwifery literature. This mixed methods study explored the student midwife experience of developing skills {{in the performance of}} a pregnancy abdominal examination. Data collection for the Phase One section of the study involved conducting semi-structured interviews with six experienced registered midwives, exploring their reality of supervising student midwives performing a pregnancy abdominal examination. Using thematic analysis, the findings drove the design of a self-completion survey for Phase Two of the study. In total, 23 student midwives described their knowledge growth in the performance of a pregnancy abdominal examination. The study identified an important connection between tacit knowledge development and competency growth in the performance of this procedure. A conceptual model was devised from the quantitative and qualitative findings, where it was proposed that tacit knowledge is embedded in experience, multi-sensory integration, palpatory literacy and the ‘know-how’ and support of midwife preceptors. The study raises important issues for practice by demonstrating the multi-faceted learning strategies that are fundamental for student midwives’ cognitive skill development of a mandated competency. Application of any research recommendations requires a collective approach with stakeholders, to integrate effective teaching and learning strategies to support student knowledge growth. The study acknowledges the need for further empirical research, to understand knowledge growth over the progression of midwifery courses as well as the mechanisms which support practical skill learning and <b>multi-sensory</b> <b>perception.</b> Submitted in the fulfilment of the requirements of the degree of Master of Education, University of the Sunshine Coast, 2017...|$|E
40|$|Research and {{commercial}} robots have infiltrated homes, hospitals and schools, becoming attractive and proving impactful for children’s healthcare, therapy, edutainment, and other applications. The {{focus of this}} thesis is to investigate a little explored issue of how children’s perception of the robot changes with age, and thus to create such a robot to adapt to these differences. In particular, this research investigates the impact of gender segregation on children’s interactions with a humanoid NAO robot. To this end, a series of experiments was conducted with children aged between 5 and 12 years old. The results suggest that children aged between 9 and 12 years old do not support gender segregation hypothesis with a gendered robot. In order to dynamically adapt to children’s age and gender, a perception module was developed using depth data and a collected depth dataset of 3 D body metrics of 428 children aged between 5 and 16 years old. This module is able to successfully determine children’s gender in real-world settings with 60. 89 % (76. 64 % offline) accuracy and estimate children’s age with a mean absolute error of only 1. 83 (0. 77 offline) years. Additionally, a pretend play testbed was designed {{in order to address}} the challenges of evaluating child-robot interaction by exploiting the advantages of multi-modal, <b>multi-sensory</b> <b>perception.</b> The pretend play testbed performed successfully at children’s play center, where a humanoid NAO robot was able to dynamically adapt its gender by changing its synthesized voice to match child’s perceived age and gender. By analyzing the free play of children, the results confirm the hypothesis of gender segregation for children aged younger than 8 years old. These findings are important to consider when designing robotic applications for children in order to improve engagement, which is essential for robot’s educational and therapeutic benefits...|$|E
40|$|Music {{composed}} 'after' painting has featured {{prominently in}} the repertory of Western art music, yet it has received little scholarly attention as an aesthetic phenomenon. Despite certain commonalities with programme music {{on the one hand}} and forms of musical multimedia on the other, music after painting (MaP) differs crucially from these manifestations, in that the non-musical component - the painting - is conspicuous by its absence, hence its more usual treatment as a feature incidental to the music, a mere citational allusion. But what happens when the painting is treated as integral to the aesthetic experience In what ways can music reach towards this other experiential domain, and how might the seeming incommensurability of music and painting - as 'temporal' and 'spatial' media - be transcended Drawing on, among other sources, the philosophy of Adorno, the phenomenology of Husserl and Clifton, the literary theory of Iser and recent theories of metaphor (Scruton and Guck), this thesis argues that the experience of music is never phenomenally 'self-present', that it is always supplemented by an element of 'ideation' (Iser), the evocation of non-existent or absent objects. Moreover, theories of <b>multi-sensory</b> <b>perception</b> challenge the idea of a musical experience that is purely auditory, demonstrating, rather, its susceptibility to a crossed modality in which one domain of experience either invokes or proves to be dependent on the memory or excitement of another. A dynamic response theory is therefore put forward to account for the painting as a frame of reference which directs, selects and contextualises this embodied experience. These possibilities of cross-domain mapping are then explored in three case studies - Morton Feldman's Rothko Chapel (1971) Henri Dutilleux's Timbre, Espace, Mouvement: ou La nuit etoilee (1978) and Tan Dun's Death and Fire: Dialogue with Paul Klee (1992) - each of which highlights a different aspect of the music-painting conjunction while suggesting reasons for the resilience of MaP within aesthetic modernism...|$|E
40|$|As an {{expressive}} language, {{fashion design}} has an innate capacity to engage a full gamut of sensorial responses. This research explores {{the contribution of}} synaesthesia to fashion design {{in an effort to}} highlight the positive aesthetic and intellectual impact of this integration. Such research advances my creative practice. The method of realising garments which address synaesthetic principles is an extension of personal interest in synaesthesia, driven from both an experiential perspective and a desire to gain a greater understanding into theories in relation to challenging the senses in a contemporary fashion world. If fashion includes novelty as a crucial and desirable aspect, and can be defined as an ever evolving and self rejuvenating art form, then the energy and frivolity of these components in association with multiple sensory stimuli and response will expose the consequence of the study through design-work. Recognition of the importance of sensory cross-overs in fashion design will reveal the quintessence of how humans position themselves and respond to a specific environment. If realisation of the senses is with regard to surroundings, and fashion becomes the surrounding which elicits multiple involuntary responses from stimuli, a conscious recognition has begun. Traditional theories on the organisation of sense modalities speculate that humans perceive their world with five senses, the most dominant generally being sight. The combined effect of these senses creates the environment in which we inhabit. The visual and tactile senses have long been the focus of the fashion product but, of all the senses, touch is most key to our species (Ackerman, 1990). Sound, taste and smell have been under-recognised as providers of ceaseless information about our environment. The investigation into the notion that fashion and other sensory systems are not separate entities assists with establishing the links between sensory integration and fashion design. The emergence of the synaesthetic paradigm has highlighted a unity between the senses rather than the traditional hierarchy of favouring the visual. The research on synaesthesia relative to fashion design occupies a parallel position to neurological theory and allows synaesthetic investigation to be a pivotal determining factor towards my outcome. I have engaged in critical self-reflection of my design process and production as a means of elucidating stimuli associated with <b>multi-sensory</b> <b>perception...</b>|$|E
