5|$|Kilburn {{anticipated}} {{a return}} to Malvern but Williams persuaded him to stay {{to work on the}} university's collaborative project developing the Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercial computer. Max Newman withdrew from the project, believing that the development of computers required engineers and not mathematicians at this point, but Williams preferred to return to electrotechnics, leaving Kilburn in charge. He was assisted by Alan Turing, who arrived at Manchester in 1948. The Mark I incorporated innovations such as index registers, and combined CRTs with <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> storage. Nine Mark I computers were sold by between 1951 and 1957.|$|E
5|$|The next {{computer}} that von Neumann designed was the IAS machine at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He arranged its financing, and the components were {{designed and built}} at the RCA Research Laboratory nearby. John von Neumann recommended that the IBM 701, nicknamed the defense computer include a <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum.</b> It was a faster version of the IAS machine and {{formed the basis for}} the commercially successful IBM 704.|$|E
5|$|Two {{versions}} of the machine were produced. The first was the world's first transistorised computer, and became operational in November 1953. The second version was completed in April 1955. The 1955 version used 200 transistors, 1,300 solid-state diodes, and had a power consumption of 150 watts. The machine did however make use of valves to generate its 125kHz clock waveforms and in the circuitry {{to read and write}} on its <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> memory, so it was not the first completely transistorised computer, a distinction that went to the Harwell CADET of 1955.|$|E
5000|$|By June 1963 the Time-Sharing System (TSS) Model Zero was {{demonstrated}} after <b>magnetic</b> <b>drums</b> {{were added to}} the time-sharing. Each user was given a priority-based time slice, measured in milliseconds, when the user's program was written from the <b>magnetic</b> <b>drums</b> into much higher speed memory, processed, and then written back to the <b>magnetic</b> <b>drums</b> with any computational changes that had occurred. It was influenced by early experiments at Bolt, Beranek, and Newman, and the CTSS project at MIT. [...] Terminals included several Teletype Model 33 ASRs.|$|R

50|$|In 1964 Teleregister {{introduced}} the Am-Quote system with which a broker could enter code numbers into a standard telephone; {{a second later}} a pleasant (prerecorded) voice repeated the code numbers and provided the required price information. This system, like Ultronics’, made use of <b>magnetic</b> <b>drums.</b>|$|R
5|$|Of the 20 bits {{allocated}} for each program instruction, 10 {{were used to}} hold the instruction code, which allowed for 1,024 (210) different instructions. The machine had 26 initially, increasing to 30 when the function codes to programmatically control the data transfer between the <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> and the cathode ray tube (CRT) main store were added. On the Intermediary Version programs were input by key switches, and the output was displayed {{as a series of}} dots and dashes on a cathode ray tube known as the output device, just as on the SSEM from which the Mark 1 had been developed. However, the Final Specification machine, completed in October 1949, benefitted from the addition of a teleprinter with a 5-hole paper-tape reader and punch.|$|E
25|$|That {{distinction}} {{goes to the}} Harwell CADET of 1955, {{built by}} the electronics division of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell. The design featured a 64-kilobyte <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> memory store with multiple moving heads that had been designed at the National Physical Laboratory, UK. By 1953 this team had transistor circuits operating {{to read and write}} on a smaller <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> from the Royal Radar Establishment. The machine used a low clock speed of only 58kHz to avoid having to use any valves to generate the clock waveforms.|$|E
25|$|The Binson Echorec, {{another popular}} unit, used a {{rotating}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> or disc (not entirely unlike {{those used in}} modern hard disk drives) as its storage medium. This provided an advantage over tape, as the durable drums were able to last for many years with little deterioration in the audio quality.|$|E
50|$|Historically, early {{computers}} used delay lines, Williams tubes, or rotating <b>magnetic</b> <b>drums</b> {{as primary}} storage. By 1954, those unreliable methods were mostly replaced by magnetic core memory. Core memory remained dominant until the 1970s, when advances in integrated circuit technology allowed semiconductor memory to become economically competitive.|$|R
5000|$|Available {{peripherals}} included teletypewriters, {{paper tape}} readers/punches, punched card readers/punches, line printers, magnetic tape drives, <b>magnetic</b> <b>drums,</b> fixed and removable magnetic disk drives, display terminals, communications controllers, Digigraphic display units, timers, etc. These interfaced to the processor using unbuffered interrupt-driven [...] "A/Q" [...] channels or buffered Direct Storage Access channels.|$|R
25|$|UNIVAC, {{the first}} {{commercial}} computer manufacturer, produced a series of EXEC operating systems. Like all early main-frame systems, this batch-oriented system managed <b>magnetic</b> <b>drums,</b> disks, card readers and line printers. In the 1970s, UNIVAC produced the Real-Time Basic (RTB) system to support large-scale time sharing, also patterned after the Dartmouth BC system.|$|R
25|$|At the University of Manchester, a team {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Tom Kilburn designed and built a machine using the newly developed transistors instead of valves. Initially the only devices available were germanium point-contact transistors, less reliable than the valves they replaced but which consumed far less power. Their first transistorised computer and the first in the world, was operational by 1953, and a second version was completed there in April 1955. The 1955 version used 200 transistors, 1,300 solid-state diodes, and had a power consumption of 150 watts. However, the machine did make use of valves to generate its 125kHz clock waveforms and in the circuitry to read and write on its <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> memory, so it was not the first completely transistorized computer.|$|E
25|$|The first {{commercial}} computer was the Ferranti Mark 1, built by Ferranti and {{delivered to the}} University of Manchester in February 1951. It {{was based on the}} Manchester Mark 1. The main improvements over the Manchester Mark 1 were {{in the size of the}} primary storage (using random access Williams tubes), secondary storage (using a <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum),</b> a faster multiplier, and additional instructions. The basic cycle time was 1.2 milliseconds, and a multiplication could be completed in about 2.16 milliseconds. The multiplier used almost a quarter of the machine's 4,050 vacuum tubes (valves). A second machine was purchased by the University of Toronto, before the design was revised into the Mark 1 Star. At least seven of these later machines were delivered between 1953 and 1957, one of them to Shell labs in Amsterdam.|$|E
500|$|The SSEM's 32-bit {{word length}} was {{increased}} to 40 bits. Each word could hold either one 40-bit number or two 20-bit program instructions. The main store initially {{consisted of two}} double-density Williams tubes, each holding two arrays of 32 x 40-bit words– known as pages– backed up by a <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> capable of storing an additional 32 pages. [...] The capacity was increased in the Final Specification version to eight pages of main store on four Williams tubes and 128 <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> pages of backing store. The [...] diameter drum, initially known as a magnetic wheel, contained a series of parallel magnetic tracks around its surface, {{each with its own}} read/write head. Each track held 2,560bits, corresponding to twopages (2×32×40bits). One revolution of the drum took 30milliseconds, during which time both pages could be transferred to the CRT main memory, although the actual data transfer time depended on the latency, the time it took for a page to arrive under the read/write head. Writing pages to the drum took about twice as long as reading. The drum's rotational speed was synchronised to the main central processor clock, which allowed for additional drums to be added. Data was recorded onto the drum using a phase modulation technique still known today as Manchester coding.|$|E
50|$|The first {{automatic}} intercept systems used rotating <b>magnetic</b> <b>drums</b> containing multiple recorded phrases, with {{a computer}} or mechanical control system playing phrases in the proper sequence. Initially, the caller was given the option {{to remain on the}} line for a live operator after the announcement was completed; this has now been removed.|$|R
5000|$|A direct-access {{storage device}} (DASD) {{pronounced}} [...] ) is a secondary storage device in which [...] "each physical record has a discrete location and a unique address." [...] IBM developed DASDs {{for use with}} mainframe computers and some minicomputers. Disk drives, <b>magnetic</b> <b>drums,</b> data cells and optical disc drives are all classified as DASDs.|$|R

50|$|Along with Gilbert W. King, Edwin L. Hughes, and George W. Brown, Ridenour {{patented}} {{an information}} storage system which combined optical disk storage of large capacity and a <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> memory of low capacity. The write-once-read-many optical disk memory would be updated monthly, and recently changed data is {{held on the}} re-writable <b>magnetic</b> <b>drum</b> memory.|$|E
50|$|The first DDA built was the <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Drum</b> Digital Differential Analyzer of 1950.|$|E
50|$|Main storage {{capacity}} was 1,024 36-bit words - just over 4k bytes. Secondary storage {{was provided by}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>drums,</b> each of 4,096 words - about 20k. Anything else was stored on 1 in magnetic tape mounted in the vertical drive, vacuum-sealed behind a glass door. Peripherals included punched tape readers, punched card readers, and line printers.|$|R
50|$|A {{consequence}} of this design was that, unlike other computers with <b>magnetic</b> <b>drums,</b> the G-15 does not retain its memory when it is shut off. The only permanent tracks are two timing tracks recorded on the drum at the factory. The second track is a backup, as the tracks are liable to erasure if one of their amplifier tubes shorted out.|$|R

40|$|The {{solution}} {{of a set}} of linear algebraic equations has always been a fascinating and challenging field, justifying a lot of research investigation. The advent of digital computers has greatly facilitated these investigations and made it possible to extend the solution procedure to larger systems.

50|$|In {{the early}} days of computers, there were no disk drives, floppy disks or modern flash storage devices.
