40|$|Background Antibody against CD 40 is {{effective}} in enhancing immune responses to vaccines when chemically conjugated to the vaccine antigen. Unfortunately the requirement for chemical conjugation presents some difficulties in vaccine production and quality control which are compounded when <b>multivalent</b> <b>vaccines</b> are required. We explore here an alternative to chemical conjugation, involving the co-encapsulation of CD 40 antibody and antigens in liposomal vehicles. Methodology/Principal Findings Anti-mouse CD 40 mAb or isotype control mAb were co-entrapped individually in cationic liposomal vehicles with pneumococcal polysaccharides or diphtheria and tetanus toxoids. Retention of CD 40 binding activity upon liposomal entrapment was assessed by ELISA and flow cytometry. After subcutaneous immunization of BALB/c female mice, anti-polysaccharide and DT/TT responses were measured by ELISA. Simple co-encapsulation of CD 40 antibody allowed for the retention of CD 40 binding on the liposome surface, and also produced vaccines with enhanced imunogenicity. Antibody responses against both co-entrapped protein {{in the form of}} tetanus toxoid, and Streptococcus pneumoniae capsular polysaccharide, were enhanced by co-encapsulation with CD 40 antibody. Surprisingly, liposomal encapsulation also appeared to decrease the toxicity of high doses of CD 40 antibody as assessed by the degree of splenomegaly induced. Conclusions/Significance Liposomal co-encapsulation with CD 40 antibody may represent a practical means of producing more immunogenic <b>multivalent</b> <b>vaccines</b> and inducing IgG responses against polysaccharides without the need for conjugation...|$|R

Newer vaccine approaches for pandemic preparedness against these viruses are needed, given the limitations of vaccines currently approved for H 5 N 1 viruses {{in terms of their}} production timelines and the ability to induce protective immune responses in the absence of adjuvants. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of an adenovirus (AdV) -based <b>multivalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> approach for pandemic preparedness against H 5, H 7 and H 9 avian influenza viruses in a mouse model. Replication-defective AdV vectors expressing hemagglutinin (HA) from different subtypes and nucleoprotein (NP) from one subtype induced high levels of humoral and cellular immune responses and conferred protection against virus replication following challenge with H 5, H 7 and H 9 avian influenza virus subtypes.

The initial "Jennerian" approach involving bovine (RIT 4237, WC 3) or rhesus (RRV) rotavirus vaccine candidates showed that these vaccines were safe, well tolerated, and immunogenic but induced highly variable rates of protection against rotavirus diarrhea. The goal of a rotavirus vaccine is to prevent severe illness that can lead to dehydration in infants and young children in both developed and developing countries. These studies led to the concept that a <b>multivalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> that represented each of the four epidemiologically important VP 7 serotypes might be necessary to induce protection in young infants, the target population for vaccination.

In this study, we focused on comparing the immunogenicity (serum neutralization activity and protection against homotypic and heterotypic RVs' challenge) of individual standard RV strains (monovalent RV immunogens) and different combinations of them (multivalent RV immunogens). In result, RV immunogens showed general immunogenicity and heterotypic reaction but the multivalent RV immunogens exhibited greater serum neutralization activity and stronger heterotypic reaction than the monovalent RV immunogens (P< 0. 05). As to the protection, the multivalent RV immunogens also revealed more rapid and stronger protection against homotypic and heterotypic RVs' challenge than the monovalent RV immunogens. The results demonstrated that both the monovalent and multivalent RV immunogens exhibited high immunogenicity, but the monovalent RV immunogens could not provide enough neutralization antibodies to protect MA 104 cells against the infection with heterotypic RV strains and timely protection against homotypic and heterotypic RVs, so the <b>multivalent</b> RV <b>vaccine</b> could not be replaced by the monovalent RV vaccine...|$|R

This was demonstrated by fimbrial isolation and purification, electrophoretic and Western transfer analyses, and immunogold labeling and electron microscopy.

In response, we generated VLPs for BTV- 8 and tested the efficacy of BTV- 8 VLPs as a single immunogen and {{as a component of}} a <b>multivalent</b> <b>vaccine,</b> with VLPs of BTV- 1 and BTV- 2, in order to test if there was any interference between serotypes. All pre-Alps sheep vaccinated with BTV- 8 VLPs developed a strong neutralising antibody response to BTV- 8 and multivalent VLP vaccinated animals also developed neutralising antibodies to BTV- 1 and BTV- 2. There were no side effects observed due to the vaccination with either the single- or multivalent VLP cocktail.

This data indicates that BTV- 8 VLPs delivered as a single immunogen or as a component of a <b>multivalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> are highly efficacious. Moreover, there was no interference on the development of a strong protective immune response due to the combination of different phylogenetically unrelated BTV serotypes in the vaccinated animals.

Six week old puppies received a single vaccination while non-vaccinated control dogs received water. In each respective trial, groups of dogs were challenged 21 days after vaccination with heterologous viral isolates. Clinical observations, rectal temperature measurements, and blood and swab samples for analysis were collected throughout the study. Dogs in all studies had normal temperatures and general health up to challenge. Clinical signs of infection and temperatures outside {{the normal range}} were observed in non-vaccinated dogs challenged with CDV, CPV, CAV- 1 and CAV- 2; vaccinated dogs remained clinically normal after challenge. All dogs were sero-negative prior to vaccination, non-vaccinated dogs remaining negative until challenge. Vaccinated dogs all sero-converted by 21 days after vaccination, with further increases seen after challenge. Non-vaccinated dogs sero-converted following challenge with CPV or CAV- 2; no final blood samples were taken in the CDV and CAV- 1 studies. Rectal swab analysis showed prevention of CPV shedding in vaccinated compared to non-vaccinated dogs, and nasal swab analysis following CAV- 2 challenge showed longer duration and higher amount of viral shedding for non-vaccinated dogs. In conclusion, we demonstrated that a single administration of a minimum titre, <b>multivalent</b> <b>vaccine</b> to dogs of six weeks of age is efficacious and prevents clinical signs and mortality caused by CAV- 1 and CDV; prevents clinical signs and significantly reduces virus shedding caused by CAV- 2; and prevents clinical signs, leucopoenia and viral excretion caused by CPV...|$|E

Development of a vaccine to prevent staphylococcal infections remains a priority. To determine whether clumping factor A (ClfA) is a good target protein for inclusion in a <b>multivalent</b> <b>vaccine,</b> we evaluated its efficacy in a variety of relevant staphylococcal infection models, challenging with different S.  aureus strains. ClfA adsorbed to Alhydrogel and mixed with Sigma Adjuvant System was more immunogenic and stimulated a more robust Th 17 response than ClfA administered with alum alone. ClfA immunization induced the production of functional antibodies in rabbits and mice that blocked S.  aureus binding to fibrinogen and were opsonic for S.  aureus strains that produced little or no capsular polysaccharide. Mice immunized with ClfA showed a modest reduction in the bacterial burden recovered from subcutaneous abscesses provoked by S.  aureus USA 300 strain LAC. In addition, the ClfA vaccine reduced lethality in a sepsis model following challenge with strain Newman, but not ST 80. Vaccination with ClfA did not protect against surgical wound infection, renal abscess formation, or bacteremia. Passive immunization with antibodies to ClfA did not protect against staphylococcal bacteremia in mice or catheter-induced endocarditis in rats. Some enhancement of bacteremia was observed by ClfA immunization or passive administration of ClfA antibodies when mice were challenged by the intraperitoneal route.
