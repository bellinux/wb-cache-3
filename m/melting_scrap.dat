Primary steelmaking involves converting liquid iron from a blast furnace and steel scrap into steel via basic oxygen steelmaking or <b>melting</b> <b>scrap</b> steel and/or direct reduced iron (DRI) in an electric arc furnace. Secondary steelmaking involves refining of the crude steel before casting and the various operations are normally carried out in ladles. In secondary metallurgy, alloying agents are added, dissolved gases in the steel are lowered, and inclusions are removed or altered chemically to ensure that high-quality steel is produced after casting.|$|E

The two men {{then go back to}} the bar and win enough money at a peeing contest to buy a 1957 Pontiac. Also among the {{winnings}} is an endorsed payroll check from the pipeline. Because the payroll office refuses to cash this check, they rob the office at gunpoint and then use Cindy, who is coincidentally there as a hostage to escape the police. They switch from the stolen robbery car to their purchased 1957 Pontiac, which gets a flat tire and has no spare. While getting it fixed, they learn Cindy is a pipeline worker and they offer $5000 for her safe return. After aborting a forced abandonment of Cindy, they shoot a bear for food, then gag and tie Cindy up in the car while riding a ferry. Scott removes Cindy's gag and she says they should ransom her off for $300,000, which Scott talks the others into doing. After Scott calls the pipeline company with a ransom demand, all four break into a house and party naked in its hot tub. They instruct the pipeline representative with the money to deposit it in an open railroad car which starts to move immediately after the representative puts the money inside. The representative follows the train which results in a car chase and pistol shots through the window when he spots them picking up the money, but they escape by flipping the representative's car during the chase. After switching from a stolen car to their purchased 1957 Pontiac, they abandon Cindy at a police station. Knowing the police know the serial numbers of the $300,000, they do not spend any of it and get a job <b>melting</b> <b>scrap</b> metal.|$|E

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of <b>scrap</b> <b>melting</b> is {{an important}} aspect of EAF steelmaking and {{has been the subject of}} several studies. In EAF steelmaking, there are two distinct melting mechanisms; (i) the <b>melting</b> of <b>scrap</b> by the arc through a combination of radiant and convective heat transfer and (ii) the <b>melting</b> of <b>scrap</b> immersed in a molten steel bath without direct heating from the arc. In traditional EAF steelmaking, the first mechanism dominated the melting process but with the increasing use of 'hot heel' operation and a general trend to utilization of the liquid bath as the melting medium, the second mechanism has become more important. Previous studies have focused on investigating the melting behaviour of single scrap pieces with regular shapes, though Gaye et al. did consider the physics of multi-piece <b>scrap</b> <b>melting.</b> One of the most important aspects of <b>scrap</b> <b>melting</b> in a bath that has received little attention is the agglomeration of scrap pieces even though industrial experience suggests that this is a critical aspect of understanding the kinetics of <b>scrap</b> <b>melting.</b> The effect of preheating scrap, including the formation of oxide layer, on <b>scrap</b> <b>melting</b> kinetics is another area worthy offuture attention. This study is focused on investigating multi-piece <b>scrap</b> <b>melting</b> in liquid steel by both mathematical modeling and high temperature experimentation. The study emphasizes the formation and agglomeration of solidified shells and investigates the effect of size, shape, oxidation and initial <b>scrap</b> temperature on <b>melting</b> behaviour. A new approach for modeling melting behaviour has been developed, the phase field technique, to model convective heat transfer in the case of <b>scrap</b> <b>melting</b> in a bath. The phase field model is able to deal more easily with complex geometry compared to traditional 'sharp interface' heat transfer equations where tracking the interfaces and their interactions is complex. It is expected that from this study a better understanding of <b>scrap</b> <b>melting</b> can be developed and provide insight into how to improve the melting process in an EAF...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{recrystallization}} of hot-rolled aluminum strips was monitored inline after inline annealing at Commonwealth Aluminum Corporation (CAC) using laser-ultrasonics. The noncontact measurement {{is based}} on sensing {{the ratio of the}} compressional to the shear sound velocity in the strip thickness direction. This ratio is insensitive to strip thickness variations and varies with crystallographic texture and temperature. Therefore, recrystallization is sensed as a change of texture, from a rolling to an annealing texture. A pyrometer is used to decouple temperature and texture effects on the velocity ratio. The measurements were made on two alloys: AA 5754 and AA 5052. The capabilities and limitations of the sensor are discussed. Introduction: Aluminum sheets are often made by <b>melting</b> <b>scrap</b> aluminum, adjusting the chemistry, casting using a twin belt caster, hot rolling, cooling, batch annealing, and cold rolling. Clearly, letting the hot-rolled coil cool to subsequently anneal in a batch anneal furnace is less energy efficient than would be a new process involving hot rolling followed immediately by inline annealing. Moreover, energy savings and sheet quality would be optimal if the degree o...|$|E

To a power system an arc furnace represents an erratic load, which a leading cause of voltage flicker, harmonic distortion, and low power factor.

Three types of continuous scrap charging procedures were investigated to determine electrical energy consumption in a I-st (short ton) electric arc furnace. Cold and preheated scrap charges were continuously fed at rates averaging 37. 5 and 43. 7 lb/min, respectively. The feed rate varied appreciably from test to test owing to hangup of the scrap in the charge bin. Approximately 7 pct less electrical energy was consumed in <b>melting</b> <b>scrap</b> preheated to 8400 to 1, 1100 F by furnace off-gases than in melting cold scrap.

40|$|Recycling mixed {{aluminum}} scrap {{usually requires}} adding primary aluminum to the scrap stream as a diluent {{to reduce the}} concentration of non-aluminum constituents used in aluminum alloys. Since primary aluminum production requires approximately 10 times more energy than <b>melting</b> <b>scrap,</b> {{the bulk of the}} energy and carbon dioxide emissions for recycling are associated with using primary aluminum as a diluent. Eliminating the need for using primary aluminum as a diluent would dramatically reduce energy requirements, decrease carbon dioxide emissions, and increase scrap utilization in recycling. Electrorefining can be used to extract pure aluminum from mixed scrap. Some example applications include producing primary grade aluminum from specific scrap streams such as consumer packaging and mixed alloy saw chips, and recycling multi-alloy products such as brazing sheet. Electrorefining {{can also be used to}} extract valuable alloying elements such as Li from Al-Li mixed scrap. This project was aimed at developing an electrorefining process for purifying aluminum to reduce energy consumption and emissions by 75 % compared to conventional technology. An electrolytic molten aluminum purification process, utilizing a horizontal membrane cell anode, was designed, constructed, operated and validated. The electrorefining technology could also be used to produce ultra-high purity aluminum for advanced materials applications. The technical objectives for this project were to: - Validate the membrane cell concept with a lab-scale electrorefining cell; - Determine if previously identified voltage increase issue for chloride electrolytes holds for a fluoride-based electrolyte system; - Assess the probability that voltage change issues can be solved; and - Conduct a market and economic analysis to assess commercial feasibility. The process was tested using three different binary alloy compositions (Al- 2. 0 wt. % Cu, Al- 4. 7 wt. % Si, Al- 0. 6 wt. % Fe) and a brazing sheet scrap composition (Al- 2. 8 wt. % Si- 0. 7 wt. % Fe- 0. 8 wt. % Mn),. Purification factors (defined as the initial impurity concentration divided by the final impurity concentration) of greater than 20 were achieved for silicon, iron, copper, and manganese. Cell performance was measured using its current and voltage characteristics and composition analysis of the anode, cathode, and electrolytes. The various cells were autopsied as part of the study. Three electrolyte systems tested were: LiCl- 10 wt. % AlCl 3, LiCl- 10 wt. % AlCl 3 - 5 wt. % AlF 3 and LiF- 10 wt. % AlF 3. An extended four-day run with the LiCl- 10 wt. % AlCl 3 - 5 wt. % AlF 3 electrolyte system was stable for the entire duration of the experiment, running at energy requirements about one third of the Hoopes and the conventional Hall-Heroult process. Three different anode membranes were investigated with respect to their purification performance and survivability: a woven graphite cloth with 0. 05 cm nominal thickness & > 90 % porosity, a drilled rigid membrane with nominal porosity of 33 %, and another drilled rigid graphite membrane with increased thickness. The latter rigid drilled graphite was selected as the most promising membrane design. The economic viability of the membrane cell to purify scrap is sensitive to primary & scrap aluminum prices, and the cost of electricity. In particular, it is sensitive to the differential between scrap and primary aluminum price which is highly variable and dependent on the scrap source. In order to be economically viable, any scrap post-processing technology in the U. S. market must have a total operating cost well below the scrap price differential of $ 0. 20 -$ 0. 40 per lb to the London Metal Exchange (LME), a margin of 65 %- 85 % of the LME price. The cost to operate the membrane cell is estimated to be < $ 0. 24 /lb of purified aluminum. The energy cost is estimated to be $ 0. 05 /lb of purified aluminum with the remaining costs being repair and maintenance, electrolyte, labor, taxes and depreciation. The bench-scale work on membrane purification cell process has demonstrated technological advantages and substantial energy and investment savings against other electrolytic processes. However, in order to realize commercial reality, the following items need to be fully investigated: 1. Further evaluation of a pure fluoride electrolyte. 2. Investigate alternative non conductive, more mechanically robust and chemically inert membrane candidates. 3. Optimized membrane cell design to understand contribution of fluid flow patterns and the mass transfer conditions. 4. Improve current efficiency and total metallic aluminum recovery from the cell.
