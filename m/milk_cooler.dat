25|$|When {{refrigeration}} {{first arrived}} (the 19th century) the equipment was initially used to cool cans of milk, which were filled by hand milking. These cans were placed into a cooled water bath {{to remove heat}} and keep them cool until {{they were able to}} be transported to a collection facility. As more automated methods were developed for harvesting milk, hand milking was replaced and, as a result, the milk can was replaced by a bulk <b>milk</b> <b>cooler.</b> 'Ice banks' were the first type of bulk <b>milk</b> <b>cooler.</b> This was a double wall vessel with evaporator coils and water located between the walls at the bottom and sides of the tank. A small refrigeration compressor was used to remove heat from the evaporator coils. Ice eventually builds up around the coils, until it reaches a thickness of about three inches surrounding each pipe, and the cooling system shuts off. When the milking operation starts, only the milk agitator and the water circulation pump, which flows water across the ice and the steel walls of the tank, are needed to reduce the incoming milk to a temperature below 5 degrees.|$|E
25|$|This {{cooling method}} {{worked well for}} smaller dairies, however was fairly inefficient {{and was unable to}} meet the {{increasingly}} higher cooling demand of larger milking parlors. In the mid-1950s direct expansion refrigeration was first applied directly to the bulk <b>milk</b> <b>cooler.</b> This type of cooling utilizes an evaporator built directly into the inner wall of the storage tank to remove heat from the milk. Direct expansion is able to cool milk at a much faster rate than early ice bank type coolers and is still the primary method for bulk tank cooling today on small to medium-sized operations.|$|E
25|$|Another device {{which has}} contributed {{significantly}} to milk quality is the plate heat exchanger (PHE). This device utilizes a number of specially designed stainless steel plates with small spaces between them. Milk is passed between every other set of plates with water being passed between {{the balance of the}} plates to remove heat from the milk. This method of cooling can remove large amounts of heat from the milk in a very short time, thus drastically slowing bacteria growth and thereby improving milk quality. Ground water is the most common source of cooling medium for this device. Dairy cows consume approximately 3 gallons of water for every gallon of milk production and prefer to drink slightly warm water as opposed to cold ground water. For this reason, PHE's can result in drastically improved milk quality, reduced operating costs for the dairymen by reducing the refrigeration load on his bulk <b>milk</b> <b>cooler,</b> and increased milk production by supplying the cows with a source of fresh warm water.|$|E

The {{aim was to}} produce updated data about the incidence of energy consumption for <b>milk</b> <b>cooling,</b> useful for energy auditing research in livestock. The cost in electricity bills and the weight on the current price of sheep milk were calculated. The experimental work was carried out on 22 <b>milk</b> <b>cooling</b> systems in Sardinia, equipped with open-type tank and direct expansion system. A performance test was performed to determine the cooling time, monitoring the <b>milk</b> <b>cooling</b> energy consumption simultaneously. Factors affecting energy consumption were identified, such {{as the number of}} milkings, power/volume ratio and performance class. The average energy consumption was 1. 795 kWh/ 100 l for two milkings and 2. 427 kWh/ 100 l for four milkings tanks. The energy consumption for storage of <b>cooled</b> <b>milk</b> was estimated averagely 0. 120 kWh/ 100 l.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to provide insight into the {{variations}} in dairy farm electricity costs across five electricity tariffs. The effect of four <b>milk</b> <b>cooling</b> scenarios is also simulated to illustrate the effect of technologies on the electricity consumption, related costs and CO 2 emissions of a dairy farm. Helping dairy farmers to make informed business decisions when confronted with future options in the sphere of electricity tariffs and energy efficient cooling systems will contribute to optimum farm profitability and will help to improve the profitability and sustainability of the industry. A previously developed model capable of simulating electricity consumption, related costs and CO 2 emissions of dairy farms was used to simulate five electricity tariffs (Flat, Day&Night, Time of Use Tariff 1 (TOU 1), TOU 2 and Real Time Pricing (RTP)) on a dairy farm with 195 milking cows. The Flat tariff consisted on one electricity price for all time periods, the Day&Night tariff consisted of two electricity prices, a high rate from 09 : 00 to 00 : 00 h and a low rate thereafter. The TOU tariff structure was similar to that of the Day&Night tariff except that a third peak price band was introduced between 17 : 00 and 19 : 00 h. The RTP tariff varied dynamically according to the electricity demand on the national grid. The model used in these simulations is a mechanistic mathematical representation of the electricity consumption that simulates farm equipment under the following headings; <b>milk</b> <b>cooling</b> system, water heating system, milking machine system, lighting systems, water pump systems and the winter housing facilities. Direct expansion, ice bank and pre-cooling <b>milk</b> <b>cooling</b> systems were simulated to determine how dairy farm electricity consumption, related costs and CO 2 emissions vary according to the <b>milk</b> <b>cooling</b> system installed on the farm. Annual simulated electricity consumption of the farm was 32, 670 kWh when a direct expansion <b>milk</b> <b>cooling</b> system without pre-cooling of milk was included in the model. The annual electricity consumption of the farm on the day & night tariff was € 4, 571. Adding precooling with ground water to the direct expansion <b>milk</b> <b>cooling</b> system reduced annual electricity consumption by 28 % to 23, 660 kWh and reduced annual electricity costs by 38 % to € 2, 875. The addition of a pre-cooling system to the direct expansion <b>milk</b> <b>cooling</b> system saved 3, 973 kg of CO 2. Simulation of an ice bank <b>milk</b> <b>cooling</b> system without pre-cooling resulted in annual simulated electricity consumption of 34, 777 kWh.

It is well known fact that operation of many refrigeration systems is dynamic in nature and bulk milk coolers are no exception to this. It is necessary to study bulk milk cooling systems and improve them to reduce chilling time and energy consumption within desired limits. Bulk milk coolers are analyzed and diagnosed with a simple thermodynamic model. A global approach is required whereby detailed component models are linked together to develop an accurate and complete simulation model package of vapour compression bulk <b>milk</b> <b>cooler.</b> These component models include mass, momentum and energy balance equation along with thermo physical property data and the appropriate heat or work transfer relationships. Solving these equations by method of substitution yields a prediction of refrigeration system behaviour. This helps in large reduction in time and cost spent in designing a system for given application, leading to the opportunity of achieving a more optimal design through evaluation of different design configurations. This dynamic model helps in adopting better control strategies to improve energy efficiency.

The milk analyses were originated by milk sampling from cooling system of each MPU at two seasons, summer and winter of 2012. The milk samples were sent and analyzed in laboratory of Associação Paranaense de Criadores de Bovinos da Raça Holandês - APCBRH, Curitiba - Parana. In the first study it was objectified to evaluate MPU profile and milk quality, using data of milk analyses {{as a tool for}} characterization from the perspective of Normative Instruction No. 62 / 2012 of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply. The data were undergone to correlation analysis and descriptive statistics. It was observed that MPU were conducted by family members as work based, farmers showed average age of 41 and 60 years with elementary school. The majority of MPU has agriculture as main activity, and this herd is mostly composed of Holstein and Jersey breeds. There was difference (P 0. 05) of CBT for state nor season, with average value of 1, 456, 000 CFU/mL, i. e., not allowed by Brazilian legislation (< 600, 000 CFU/mL). Furthermore, it was observed that MPU are in phase of transition for organic system, and suffer difficulties at sanitary and food managements, as well as access to technical information related to the organic system. In the second study, it was used multivariate statistical method (factor analysis and cluster) by non-hierarchical agglomerative method to identify factors involved in milk production that may affect milk quality and productivity.
