40|$|Background: The {{impact of}} a primary {{colorectal}} cancer screening with computerized tomographic colonography on current <b>radiological</b> <b>capacity</b> is unknown. The multispecialty needs for computerized tomographic examinations raise some doubts on the feasibility of a mass colorectal cancer screening with computerized tomographic colonography. Aim: To assess {{whether the number of}} available computerized tomographic units in Europe is adequate to cover population screening with computerized tomographic colonography. Methods: A mathematical and a Markov model were, respectively, used to assess the number of computerized tomographic colonography procedures needed to be performed each day in the start-up and in the steady-state phases of a colorectal cancer screening programme in Europe. Such outcome was divided for the total number of computerized tomographic machines aged < 10 years estimated to be present in the European hospitals. Results: At a simulated 30 % compliance, 28 760 130 European people would need to be screened by the 3482 available computerized tomographic units in a 5 -year start-up period, corresponding to 6. 6 CTC/CT unit/day. Assuming a 10 -year repetition of computerized tomographic colonography between 50 and 80 years, the number of computerized tomographic colonography needed to be performed in the steady-state period appeared to be 4. 3 /CT unit/day. Conclusions: The current <b>radiological</b> <b>capacity</b> may cover the need for a primary colorectal cancer screening with computerized tomographic colonography in a steady state. On the other hand, a substantial implementation of the current computerized tomographic capacity or a synergistic approach with other techniques seems to be necessary for the start-up period. © 2008 The Authors...|$|R

40|$|Objective:The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the diagnostic accuracy of multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) compared to histopathological findings in tumor staging of renal cell carcinoma, with the focus on tumor size and stage, renal vein involvement, and peri-renal infiltration. Materials and Methods: In a retrospective study, a total of 98 consecutive Patients with renal cell carcinoma were preoperatively assessed for tumor staging using multidetector-row CT. Triphasic CT imaging (i. e., noncontrast, arterial, and parenchymal phase) was performed using multidetector-row CT with the slice thickness of 5 mm and using multi planar reconstructions to define the tumor characteristics. A single blinded reader evaluated the CT scans independently who reviewed the scan on multi planar reconstructions. The results were then correlated with the histopathological results. Results: A total of 98 renal cell carcinomas were proven on histopathology. There was a significant (p 0. 05) difference in the mean <b>maximum</b> <b>radiological</b> and <b>maximum</b> pathological diameter of the tumor with radiological diameter being greater. Twenty seven tumors were down staged and only 1 was up staged. The specificity of CT for capsular invasion, nodal disease and adrenal involvement was 85, 82 and 98 % respectively. The specificity was over 97 % for tumor thrombus in renal vein and IVC. Conclusions: The multi planar reconstruction capability of multidetector-row CT allowed good specificity in predicting renal vein, IVC involvement, capsular invasion and nodal disease...|$|R
40|$|Safety must be ensured {{during all}} phases of space fission system design, development, fabrication, launch, operation, and shutdown. One {{potential}} space fission system application is fission electric propulsion (FEP), in which fission energy is converted into electricity and used to power high efficiency (Isp greater than 3000 s) electric thrusters. For these types of systems {{it is important to}} determine which operational scenarios ensure safety while allowing maximum mission performance and flexibility. Space fission systems are essentially nonradioactive at launch, prior to extended operation at high power. Once high power operation begins, system radiological inventory steadily increases as fission products build up. For a given fission product isotope, the <b>maximum</b> <b>radiological</b> inventory is typically achieved once the system has operated for a length of time equivalent to several half-lives. After that time, the isotope decays at the same rate it is produced, and no further inventory builds in. For an FEP mission beginning in Earth orbit, altitude and orbital lifetime increase as the propulsion system operates. Two simultaneous effects of fission propulsion system operation are thus (1) increasing fission product inventory and (2) increasing orbital lifetime. Phrased differently, as fission products build up, more time is required for the fission products to naturally convert back into non-radioactive isotopes. Simultaneously, as fission products build up, orbital lifetime increases, providing more time for the fission products to naturally convert back into non-radioactive isotopes. Operational constraints required to ensure safety can thus be quantified...|$|R
40|$|This {{study used}} a {{homogeneous}} water-equivalent model of an electronic portal imaging device (EPID), contoured as a structure in a radiotherapy treatment plan, to produce reference dose images for comparison with in vivo EPID dosimetry images. Head and neck treatments were {{chosen as the}} focus of this study, due to the heterogeneous anatomies involved and the consequent difficulty of rapidly obtaining reliable reference dose images by other means. A phantom approximating the size and heterogeneity of a typical neck, with a <b>maximum</b> <b>radiological</b> thickness of 8. 5 cm, was constructed for use in this study. This phantom was CT scanned and a simple treatment including five square test fields and one off-axis IMRT field was planned. In order to allow the treatment planning system to calculate dose in a model EPID positioned a distance downstream from the phantom to achieve a source-to-detector distance (SDD) of 150 cm, the CT images were padded with air and the phantom’s “body” contour was extended to encompass the EPID contour. Comparison of dose images obtained from treatment planning calculations and experimental irradiations showed good agreement, with more than 90 % of points in all fields passing a gamma evaluation, at γ (3 %, 3 mm) Similar agreement was achieved when the phantom was over-written with air in the treatment plan and removed from the experimental beam, suggesting that water EPID model at 150 cm SDD is capable of providing accurate reference images for comparison with clinical IMRT treatment images, for patient anatomies with radiological thicknesses ranging from 0 up to approximately 9 cm. This methodology therefore {{has the potential to be}} used for in vivo dosimetry during treatments to tissues in the neck as well as the oral and nasal cavities, in the head-and-neck region...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{accurate}} {{identification of}} tissue electron densities {{is of great}} importance for Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculations. When converting patient CT data into a voxelised format suitable for MC simulations, however, {{it is common to}} simplify the assignment of electron densities so that the complex tissues existing in the human body are categorized into a few basic types. This study examines the effects that the assignment of tissue types and the calculation of densities can have on the results of MC simulations, for the particular case of a Siemen’s Sensation 4 CT scanner located in a radiotherapy centre where QA measurements are routinely made using 11 tissue types (plus air). Methods: DOSXYZnrc phantoms are generated from CT data, using the CTCREATE user code, with the relationship between Hounsfield units (HU) and density determined via linear interpolation between a series of specified points on the ‘CT-density ramp’ (see Figure 1 (a)). Tissue types are assigned according to HU ranges. Each voxel in the DOSXYZnrc phantom therefore has an electron density (electrons/cm 3) defined by the product of the mass density (from the HU conversion) and the intrinsic electron density (electrons /gram) (from the material assignment), in that voxel. In this study, we consider the problems of density conversion and material identification separately: the CT-density ramp is simplified by decreasing the number of points which define it from 12 down to 8, 3 and 2; and the material-type-assignment is varied by defining the materials which comprise our test phantom (a Supertech head) as two tissues and bone, two plastics and bone, water only and (as an extreme case) lead only. The effect of these parameters on radiological thickness maps derived from simulated portal images is investigated. Results & Discussion: Increasing the degree of simplification of the CT-density ramp results in an increasing effect on the resulting radiological thickness calculated for the Supertech head phantom. For instance, defining the CT-density ramp using 8 points, instead of 12, results in a <b>maximum</b> <b>radiological</b> thickness change of 0. 2 cm, whereas defining the CT-density ramp using only 2 points results in a <b>maximum</b> <b>radiological</b> thickness change of 11. 2 cm. Changing the definition of the materials comprising the phantom between water and plastic and tissue results in millimetre-scale changes to the resulting radiological thickness. When the entire phantom is defined as lead, this alteration changes the calculated radiological thickness by a maximum of 9. 7 cm. Evidently, the simplification of the CT-density ramp has a greater effect on the resulting radiological thickness map than does the alteration of the assignment of tissue types. Conclusions: It is possible to alter the definitions of the tissue types comprising the phantom (or patient) without substantially altering the results of simulated portal images. However, these images are very sensitive to the accurate identification of the HU-density relationship. When converting data from a patient’s CT into a MC simulation phantom, therefore, all possible care should be taken to accurately reproduce the conversion between HU and mass density, for the specific CT scanner used.

40|$|Several compact proton {{accelerator}} systems {{for use in}} proton therapy have recently been proposed. Of paramount importance {{to the development of}} such an accelerator system is the maximum kinetic energy of protons, immediately prior to entry into the patient, that must be reached by the treatment system. The commonly used value for the maximum kinetic energy required for a medical {{proton accelerator}} is 250 MeV, but it has not been demonstrated that this energy is indeed necessary to treat all or most patients eligible for proton therapy. This article quantifies the maximum kinetic energy of protons, immediately prior to entry into the patient, necessary to treat a given percentage of patients with rotational proton therapy, and examines the impact of this energy threshold on the cost and feasibility of a compact, gantry-mounted proton accelerator treatment system. One hundred randomized treatment plans from patients treated with IMRT were analyzed. The <b>maximum</b> <b>radiological</b> pathlength {{from the surface of the}} patient to the distal edge of the treatment volume was obtained for 180 ° continuous arc proton therapy and for 180 ° split arc proton therapy (two 90 ° arcs) using CT# profiles from the Pinnacle™ (Philips Medical Systems, Madison, WI) treatment planning system. In each case, the maximum kinetic energy of protons, immediately prior to entry into the patient, that would be necessary to treat the patient was calculated using proton range tables for various media. In addition, Monte Carlo simulations were performed to quantify neutron production in a water phantom representing a patient as a function of the maximum proton kinetic energy achievable by a proton treatment system. Protons with a kinetic energy of 240 MeV, immediately prior to entry into the patient, were needed to treat 100 % of patients in this study. However, it was shown that 90 % of patients could be treated at 198 MeV, and 95 % of patients could be treated at 207 MeV. Decreasing the proton kinetic energy from 250 to 200 MeV decreases the total neutron energy fluence produced by stopping a monoenergetic pencil beam in a water phantom by a factor of 2. 3. It is possible to significantly lower the requirements on the maximum kinetic energy of a compact proton accelerator if the ability to treat a small percentage of patients with rotational therapy is sacrificed. This decrease in maximum kinetic energy, along with the corresponding decrease in neutron production, could lower the cost and ease the engineering constraints on a compact proton accelerator treatment facility...|$|R

We therefore hypothesized a beneficial effect on fracture healing under local application of statins. A closed fracture of the right tibia of 5 -month-old Sprague-Dawley rats (n= 200) was applied. Intramedullary stabilization was achieved with uncoated vs. coated titanium Kirschner wires. Test substances were incorporated into a biodegradable layer of poly(D,L-lactide).

40|$|OBJECTIVES This is the {{experience}} with the Stratos system in two surgical centres {{for the management of}} two types of rib fractures: flail chest and multiple dislocated rib fractures with significant chest wall deformity. METHODS From January 2009 to May 2012, 94 consecutive patients were included. Selected indications were extended anterolateral flail chest (n = 68) and dislocated painful rib fractures (n = 26). The open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) system consists of flexible titanium rib clamps and connecting plates. The postoperative course was assessed. Clinical and functional outcomes were evaluated at 6 months. Functional assessment consisted of measurement of the functional vital capacity (FVC) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination with determination of the <b>radiological</b> vital <b>capacity</b> (rVC) in patients with a flail chest. RESULTS The median operation time and length of hospital stay were 122 min and 19 days, respectively, in patients with a flail chest, and 67 min and 11 days, respectively, in patients with dislocated painful rib fractures. The morbidity rate was 6. 4 % and the overall 30 -day mortality rate was 1. 1 %. Clinical evaluation and pulmonary function testing at 6 months revealed no deformity of the chest wall, symmetrical shoulder girdle mobility in 88 % and a feeling of stiffness on the operated side in 19 % of the patients operated for a flail chest. Median ratio of FVC was 88 %, not suggesting any restriction after stabilization. MRI was performed in 53 % (36 of 68) of the patients with a flail chest. The analysis of the rVC showed, on average, no clinically relevant restriction related to the operation, with a mean rVC of the operated relative to the non-operated side of 92 % (95 % confidence interval: 83, 100). Stabilization of more than four ribs was associated with a lower median rVC than stabilization of four or less ribs. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that stabilization of the chest wall with this screwless rib fixation device can be performed with a low morbidity and lead to early restoration of chest wall integrity and respiratory pump function, without clinically relevant functional restriction. Owing to the simplicity of the fixation technique, indications for stabilization can be safely enlarged to selected patients with dislocated and painful rib fracture...|$|R

We assessed tibiotalar ankle function using the criteria of Mazur which gives a points score of a <b>maximum</b> of 100. <b>Radiological</b> evidence of degenerative change was graded {{on a scale of}} 0 to 4. The mean Mazur score was 85 for the subtalar fusions and 78 for the triple arthrodeses. The radiological score showed no degenerative changes in 36 feet (24 triple and 12 subtalar arthrodeses) and an increase of one grade in 14 feet (10 triple and 4 subtalar), of two grades in three feet (all triple arthrodeses) and of three grades in one foot after a subtalar arthrodesis. We found no statistically significant difference in the radiological score in unilateral fusions between feet with subtalar and triple arthrodeses and the contralateral foot.

40|$|Pulmonary {{hypertension}} in {{the course}} of diffuse parenchymal lung diseases — state of art and future considerations The authors declare no financial disclosure Lung diseases {{are one of the most}} frequent causes of pulmonary hypertension (PH). The development of PH influences the course of lung disease, worsening the clinical symptoms and prognosis. According to the most recent publications, PH {{in the course}} of lung diseases develops as a result of both “parenchymal ” and vascular pathology, in the patients with genetic predisposition. Prolonged infection (especially viral one) may be an additional promoting factor. Right heart catheterization (RHC), which is an invasive proce-dure, is the only objective method of diagnosing PH. According to the latest recommendations, the management algorithm of PH and coexisting interstitial lung disease is based on RHC and the results of pulmonary function tests. Majority of the patients develop mild PH {{in the course of}} advanced lung disease. Best treatment of underlying lung pathology combined with long term oxygen treatment is recommended in this group. In case of severe PH (mean resting pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) ≥ 35 mm Hg) the alternate cause of PH has to be sought. PAH-specific drugs use should be limited to patients with severe PH participating in clinical trials.

40|$|Nuclear and {{radiological}} {{events are}} large-impact, hard-to-predict rare events, whose associated probability is exceedingly low. They can exert monumental impacts {{and lead to}} grave environmental and economic consequences. Identifying common trends of these events can help to assess the threat, and to combat it with better detection capabilities and practices. One way to achieve this is to model the events with established statistical and mathematical distributions. Power-law distribution is a good candidate {{because it is a}} probability distribution with asymptotic tails, and thus can be applied to study patterns of rare events of large deviations, such as those involving nuclear and radiological materials. This thesis, based on the hypothesis that nuclear and radiological events follow the power-law growth model, assembles published data of four categories of events - incidents of nuclear and radiological materials, incidents of radioactive attacks, unauthorized activities of illicit trafficking, and incidents of nuclear terrorism, and investigates whether specific distributions such as the power-law can be applied to analyze the data. Data are gathered from a number of sources. Even though data points are collected, the databases are far from complete, mainly due to the limited amount of public information that is available to the outside party, rendering the modeling task difficult and challenging. Furthermore, there may exist many undocumented instances, underscoring the fact that the reporting is an ongoing effort. (cont.) To compile a comprehensive dataset for analytical purposes, a more efficient method of collecting data should be employed. This requires gathering information through various means, including different departmental or governmental domains that are available to the public as well as professional insight and support.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{investigate}} {{the risk factors}} predicting radiological progression in silicosis in a prospective cohort study of patients with silicosis who were previously exposed to silica from granite dust.  METHODS—From among a total of 260  patients with silicosis contracted from granite work, 141  with available serial chest x ray films of acceptable quality taken {{over a period of}} 2  to 17  (mean 7. 5) years, were selected for study. Ninety four (66. 7 %) had ended exposure 5  or more years perviously (mean 10. 1  years, <b>maximum</b> 28  years). <b>Radiological</b> progression was assessed by paired comparison of the initial and most recent radiographs, with two or more steps of increase in profusion of small opacities according to the 12  point scale of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) classification of radiographs of pneumoconiosis, taken from the majority reading by a panel of three independent readers.  RESULTS—Overall, 37 % of patients with silicosis had radiological evidence of progression. From the initial radiographs, 24  (31. 6 %) of those with radiological profusion category 1,  15  (37. 5 %) of those with radiological profusion category 2, and 13  (52 %) of those with complicated silicosis (including all seven with category 3  profusion of small opacities) showed radiological progression. As expected, progression was more likely to be found after longer periods of follow up (the interval between the two chest x ray films) with a 20 % increased odds of progression for every additional year of follow up. After adjustment for varying intervals of follow up, the probability of radiological progression was found to be significant if large opacities were present in the initial chest x ray film. Progression was also less likely to be found among those who had ended exposure to silica longer ago, although the result was of borderline significance (p= 0. 07). Tuberculosis was also associated with increased likelihood of progression (borderline significance).  CONCLUSIONS—There is a high probability of radiological progression in silicosis after high levels of exposure to granite dust among workers who were followed up for up to 17  years. A significant risk factor is the extent of radiological opacities in the initial chest x ray film. The probability of progression is also likely to be reduced with longer periods after the end of exposure.    Keywords: silicosis; radiological progression; granite quarr...|$|R

PvuII SNP (C/T rs 2234693) of ESR 1 was described {{to be associated with the}} occurrence of IS in the Chinese population; however, two replication studies did not confirm the findings. The ESR 1 SNPs have never been studied in Caucasian IS patients. METHODS: Case-control study. 287 females with IS underwent clinical, radiological and genetic examinations. The patients were divided into three groups according to curve progression velocity: non-progressive IS, slowly progressive IS (progression < 1 ° per month), and rapidly progressive IS (progression ≥ 1 ° per month). The <b>radiological</b> <b>maximum</b> Cobb angle was measured and surgery rate established. A control group consisted of 182 healthy females. RESULTS: All results followed Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. In the case-control study, genotype frequency in the patients did not differ for the XbaI (AA =  33. 5 %, AG =  49. 1 %, GG =  17. 4 %), nor for the PvuII (TT =  26. 8 %, TC =  50. 2 %, CC =  23. 0 %) comparing to controls (AA =  33. 5 %, AG =  50. 5 %, GG =  15. 9 %) and (TT =  23. 1 %, TC =  51. 1 %, CC =  25. 8 %), respectively, p =  0. 3685, p =  0. 6046. The haplotype frequency for the patients (AT =  47. 1 %, GC =  39. 2 %, AC =  8. 9 %, GT =  2. 8 %) did not differ from the controls (AT =  44. 8 %, GC =  37. 4 %, AC =  14. 0 %, GT =  3. 8 %), p =  0. 0645. No difference was found either in XbaI (p =  0. 8671) or PvuII (p =  0. 3601) allele distribution between the patients and the controls. In the case study, there was no significant difference in genotype frequency for the non-progressive, slowly progressive, and rapidly progressive scoliosis. No difference was found in genotype or haplotype distribution for the mean maximum Cobb angle or the surgery rate.

40|$|Introduction: As well as whole-body {{computed}} tomography (CT), ultrasound examinations {{are now a}} well established procedure in the initial diagnosis of polytrauma patients. They {{are an integral part}} of national and international polytrauma guidelines. Ultrasound is not only routinely used in the initial examination, but is also a follow-up tool in the clinical management of these patients. However, the diagnostic benefits of these follow-up examinations in patients with no findings in the initial abdominal {{computed tomography}} have not been sufficiently evaluated to date. In hospitals providing <b>maximum</b> care, a <b>radiological</b> clinic is short-staffed at night and during weekend shifts. Especially during on-duty-services, emergencies have to take priority over follow-up examinations. There is a risk that emergency examinations will be delayed if ultrasound-follow-ups have to be carried out within a tight time frame. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the costs and the diagnostic benefits of abdominal ultrasound follow-up of suspected polytrauma patients who had been initially examined using whole-body CT. Methods: A total of 176 patients (126 men and 50 women) with suspected multiple trauma were retrospectively analysed with regard to new and additional findings in ultrasound follow-up examinations compared with the findings of the initial whole-body computed tomography. Additionally, the sensitivity and specificity of the FAST in the emergency room were analysed. A process model was established to document the total costs of ultrasound-follow ups (staff-, material-, equipment costs). Results: The FAST examination in the emergency room revealed 26 abdominal findings in 19 patients while the computed tomography subsequently detected 32 findings in 25 patients. The calculated sensitivity of the FAST to detect organ injuries and/or free abdominal fluid was 81. 3 % and the specificity 100 %, respectively. During the abdominal ultrasound follow-up examination 2 new findings were detected. In both cases the patients had abdominal injuries detected in the initial computed tomography, and both patients had new free abdominal fluid in the follow-up. In both patients the clinical pathway did not have to be changed. The follow-up ultrasound revealed no new results in patients with normal findings in the abdominal CT (151 patients). The costs of ultrasound follow-up examinations were calculated in this study and ranged from EUR 28. 93 to EUR 33. 96, depending on the type of service provided. The total cost of all follow-up ultrasound examinations performed in this study was EUR 5, 658. 23. Conclusion: The results of this study show that a routinely used ultrasound follow-up examination after initial computed tomography only revealed new findings in exceptional cases. With patients with normal abdominal CT-scan findings, there were no new findings in the ultrasound follow-up. In conclusion, the follow-up ultrasound examination in our study had a low overall diagnostic benefit, while being associated with low cost but high personnel expenses for a radiological department...|$|R
40|$|Liver {{diseases}} in birds are very common but diagnosed rather lately. Especially amyloidosis {{is most often}} diagnosed post mortem in birds. The objective {{of this study was}} the comparison of different imaging techniques for the in vivo diagnosis of avian liver {{diseases in}} special consideration of amyloidosis for different species of falcons. Sixty-four falcons of one breeding stock were examined. First, each falcon underwent a general physical examination followed by special medical procedures: blood chemistry, haematology, radiography, computed tomography (native as well as with radiopaque material), ultrasonography with first biopsy, endoscopy with second biopsy and histopathology of the biopsies. The liver biopsy specimens of five falcons (7. 8 %) were without any pathological alteration. The histopathological examination of the remaining birds (92. 2 %) showed one or multiple diagnosis. The most common histopathological diagnosis was necrosis (59. 4 %) followed by hepatitis (50. 0 %) and degeneration (43. 8 %). For three falcons a high-grade and for two more falcons a middle-grade amyloidosis was diagnosed. The falcons with the high-grade amyloidosis revealed additionally a high-grade necrosis. In ventro-dorsal x-ray images a ratio of the parameters “maximal liver extension” (Rö-Leber-max) and “sternum length” was calculated. With this ratio (Rö-Leber-max/Sternum-Ratio) a species and body-size independent standard value of relative liver size in falcons was determined. Falcons exhibiting a Rö-Leber/Sternum-Ratio between 0. 286 and 0. 532 (onefold standard deviation) can be classified inconspicuous regarding their <b>radiological</b> <b>maximum</b> liver width. The diagnosis of a high-grade amyloidosis led to a statistically significant increase in the “maximum liver width” (p < 0. 05). In this study, other liver diseases did not affect the “maximum liver width”. The latero-lateral liver extension in the axial image of the computed tomography revealed the most convincing and reliable measure of the liver width. Comparable to the radiography a ratio of the “latero-lateral liver width” (CT-Leber-axial-ll) and the x-ray measured “sternum length” was calculated. Almost identical to the conventional radiographical results falcons exhibiting a CT-Leber-axial-ll/Sternum-Ratio between 0. 282 and 0. 532 (onefold standard deviation) can be classified inconspicuous regarding their tomographical maximum liver width. In analogy to the conventional radiography a statistically significant increase in the “maximum liver width” (p < 0. 05) in falcons with a high-grade amyloidosis was detected. Besides the conventional radiography and computed tomography the estimated liver size assessed by endoscopy is highly related to histopathological diagnosis of amyloidosis (p = 0. 001). The results from the liver extension measurements by conventional radiography and computed tomography as well as the estimated liver size assessed by endoscopy highly correlated with each other (p < 0. 001). The native liver density determined by computed tomography revealed a significant reduction in the birds with high-grade amyloidosis (p < 0. 05) and birds with high-grade necrosis (p < 0. 05). Excluding these cases values for estimation of the native liver density were calculated for the right lobe of the liver (52. 14 – 75. 98 HU) and the left lobe of the liver (54. 75 – 80. 08 HU). The different histopathological diagnoses had no influence on the liver density acquired by computed tomography with radiopaque material. The ALT-concentration in the plasma evaluated by blood chemistry analysis highly correlated with the histopathological diagnosed amyloidosis (r = 0. 418, p = 0. 001). The ALT-level therefore is a very sensitive but not specific indicator for amyloidosis. In cases of high-grade liver degeneration, elevated bile acids as well as LDH-concentration were detected (p < 0. 05). Other parameters like AST or GLDH were incapable of being used as diagnostic tools for liver diseases investigated in this study. The haematological analysis revealed that falcons with amyloidosis exhibited a decreased number of lymphocytes and a lower haematocrit accompanied by an increase in total number of leukocytes and the proportion of heterophiles. Other liver diseases including high-grade necrosis (p < 0. 005) as well as high-grade degeneration (p < 0. 001) led to an increase in total number of leukocytes. Out of a number of parameters, which were significantly influenced by amyloidosis, a score was established that was very sensitive and specific for the identification of falcons with high-grade amyloidosis in this study. This “amyloidosis-score”, calculated of Rö-Leber-max/Sternum-Ratio, inverse haematocrit, ALT-level and total number of leukocytes presented in case of high-grade amyloidosis (Score = 176. 1 ± 68. 9) an approximately 6. 5 -fold higher value compared to middle-grade amyloidosis (Score = 27. 3 ± 18. 8) and about 8. 0 -fold higher level compared to falcons without amloidosis (Score = 22. 4 ± 14. 0). In the daily routine of an average praxis using standard diagnostic tools, this “amyloidosis-score” could supply first evidence for high-grade amloidosis inducing the inevitable histopathological analysis...|$|R
