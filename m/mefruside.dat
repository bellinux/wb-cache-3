40|$|Twenty-two {{patients}} {{under general}} practice care, suffering {{mild to moderate}} hypertension and receiving no active treatment had three baseline blood pressure measurements taken during a single blind 4 -week placebo run-in period. One patient was secondarily excluded at this stage because of a placebo response and one patient dropped out for personal reasons. The remaining 20 patients were randomized to receive either nifedipine 20 mg twice a day or <b>mefruside</b> 25 mg once a day in a classical two-period crossover design with 8 -week treatment periods separated by a 4 -week single-blind placebo washout. During 8 weeks nifedipine therapy the mean supine blood pressure was reduced from 173 (s. d. = 15. 4) / 107 (s. d. = 6. 4) mmHg to 150 (s. d. = 16. 7) / 93 (s. d. = 10. 8) mmHg whereas the corresponding reduction for <b>mefruside</b> was from 174 (s. d. = 15. 9) / 107 (s. d. = 9. 4) mmHg to 153 (s. d. = 19. 1) / 94 (s. d. = 9. 7) mmHg. Neither drug affected postural changes in blood pressure. Standing blood pressure measurements under 8 weeks nifedipine therapy fell from 172 (s. d. = 12. 3) / 103 (s. d. = 5. 6) mmHg to 150 (s. d. = 17. 9) / 94 (s. d. = 10. 0) mmHg with corresponding changes for <b>mefruside</b> being 174 (s. d. = 14. 7) / 106 (s. d. = 9. 0) mmHg to 150 (s. d. = 20. 2) / 95 (s. d. = 9. 4) mmHg. Since blood pressures returned to within 4 % of baseline values {{by the end of}} the placebo washout period it can be inferred that each therapy was a significant (P less than 0. 05 for all blood pressure variables) antihypertensive treatment in its own right...|$|E
40|$|The {{long-term}} {{efficacy of}} nitrendipine and acebutolol was assessed during a 40 -week double-blind randomized trial in 60 hypertensive blacks. Nitrendipine (mean dose 32 mg/day) and acebutolol (414 mg/day) were administered in monotherapy in increasing dosage and <b>mefruside</b> was added in patients not controlled by monotherapy. The recumbent and standing blood pressures were reduced (P less than 0. 01 or less) during monotherapy with nitrendipine and acebutolol, but {{the magnitude of}} blood pressure reduction was greater (P less than 0. 05 or less) during nitrendipine dosing. Pulse rate decreased (P less than 0. 01) during acebutolol whereas nitrendipine induced a nonsignificant increase. Both treatments induced no changes in serum electrolytes, creatinine, urea, uric acid, lipids, plasma renin activity, and plasma and urinary aldosterone. The overall incidence of side effects was similar with both treatments but four patients discontinued nitrendipine because of headache. The addition of <b>mefruside</b> to nitrendipine or acebutolol produced a further fall of blood pressure in patients not controlled with monotherapy. Monotherapy with nitrendipine or acebutolol offers an effective, safe first-line antihypertensive treatment in blacks entered in this study; with the described dosages and therapeutic schedule, nitrendipine was somewhat more effective than acebutolol. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A {{controlled}} {{clinical trial}} of a new diuretic—mefruside—is reported, {{in which it was}} compared with frusemide in 15 normal subjects and 15 patients with fluid retention. It was found to be an effective diuretic which, in the patients, produced a significantly greater excretion of water and electrolytes than an equal dose of frusemide. Its smooth prolonged action, maximal in the first 12 hours, made it of particular value for maintenance therapy. In a short-term trial on a further 15 hypertensive patients <b>mefruside</b> was shown to have a useful hypotensive action. The drug was well tolerated with minimal side effects...|$|E
40|$|The renal p-aminohippurate (PAH) {{transport}} system, which {{resides in}} the S 2 segment of proximal tubules, is a main tubular secretory system for drugs. Previous {{studies have shown that}} the hydrophobicity of drugs is positively correlated with their affinity for the basolateral PAH transporter. Affinity was deduced from inhibition of tubular 3 H-PAH uptake. However, up to now, no studies are available which tested the relationship between hydrophobicity and transport rate of drugs. Therefore, in the present study, the basolateral transport rates of several drugs (Probenecid, bumetanide, <b>mefruside)</b> which are substrates of the PAH transporter and which differ markedly regarding their hydrophobic properties (log P values ranging from 1 - 3) were determined on non-perfused proximal S 2 segments microdissected from rabbit kidneys without the use of enzymatic solutions. To measure the transport rate advantage of the finding was taken that the PAH transporter in the basolateral membrane of proximal S 2 segments acts as a countertransporter which exchanges PAH with dicarboxylates (glutarate or Alpha- keto-glutarate). Hence, the stimulatory effect of a drug on the 14 C-glutarate efflux rate of 14 C-glutarate preloaded S 2 segments is a measure of its translocation across the basolateral cell membrane. The results revealed that with increasing hydrophobicity (<b>mefruside</b> < bumetanid < probenecid) the stimulating effect of the drugs on 14 C-glutarate efflux decreased indicating that the compounds are more slowly translocated although their potency to inhibit the 3 H-PAH uptake increased. Thus, an inverse relationship between hydrophobicity and hence affinity of the drugs for the PAH transporter and transport rate could be established...|$|E
40|$|Changes in glomerular {{filtration}} rate and effective renal plasma flow following a protein meal were measured in seven patients with essential hypertension on no treatment and after 6 weeks' treatment with nifedipine and <b>mefruside.</b> Glomerular {{filtration rate}} and effective renal plasma flow increased significantly following a protein meal in patients on no treatment (P less than 0. 01 and P less than 0. 05 respectively). The {{response to a}} protein meal was lost following antihypertensive treatment (P less than 0. 5 and P less than 0. 1 respectively). Although there was some increase in the fasting values of glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow this was less pronounced {{and more difficult to}} demonstrate when only fasting values were compared. We propose that the loss of response to a protein meal is due to recruitment of renal reserve function and that protein meal challenge is a sensitive test for detecting changes in renal function...|$|E
