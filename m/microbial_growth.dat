Morphological convergence towards coccoid or filamentous thalli, caused by frequent dessication stress, is typical for this group. Algae are frequently used for biomonitoring of various biotopes, mostly water biotopes, but also for bioindication of air quality. My diploma thesis is based on a study of autotrophic <b>microbial</b> <b>growths</b> on spruce and yew needles in relation to various air quality measures evaluating air pollution of sites. The results show that the occurence of <b>microbial</b> <b>growths</b> on needles is primarily influenced by the orientation towards cardinal points.

HGMFs which had been incubated 24 or 48 h at 35 °C on Trypticase soy agar were flooded underneath with 1 to 2 ml of 0. 1 % triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) solution by simply lifting {{one corner of the}} filter while it was still on the agar and adding the reagent. <b>Microbial</b> <b>growths</b> on HGMFs were counted after color had been allowed to develop for 15 min at room temperature. With representative foods, virtually all colonies stained pink to red. Automated electronic counts made by using the MI- 100 HGMF Interpreter were easier and more reliable than control HGMF counts made by the AOAC International official action procedure. Manual counting was easier as well because of increased visibility of the <b>microbial</b> <b>growths.</b> Except in the case of dairy products, 24 -h TTC counts did not differ significantly from 48 -h FGA counts, whereas the FGA counts at 24 h were always significantly lower, indicating that for many food products the HGMF TTC flooding method permits aerobic colony counts to be made after 24 h...|$|R

40|$|Background: Suppurative {{keratitis}} is {{a common}} ophthalmic condition mostly caused by fungi. Apart from fungal culture, wet preparation using 10 % Potassium hydroxide (KOH) for microscopic detection of fungal elements is a rapid and accurate method of laboratory diagnosis. Purpose: This prospective and cross sectional study was undertaken in order to evaluate the diagnostic sensitivity of wet preparation microscopy using KOH for detection of fungal agents from suppurative corneal ulcer patients. Methodology: Fifty six (56) consecutive clinically suspected patients of suppurative corneal ulcer attending Rajshahi Medical College Hospital (RMCH) {{during the period from}} July, 06 to June, 07 were included.

25|$|Biochar is {{charcoal}} {{produced at}} relatively low temperatures from a biomass {{of wood and}} leafy plant materials in an environment with very low or no oxygen. Amending soil with biochar has been observed to increase the activity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Tests of high porosity materials such as zeolite, activated carbon, and charcoal show that <b>microbial</b> <b>growth</b> substantially improves with charcoal. It may be that small pieces of charcoal migrate within the soil, providing a habitat for bacteria that decompose the biomass in the surface ground cover. This process may have {{an essential role in}} terra preta's self-propagation; a virtuous cycle develops as the fungus spreads from the charcoal, fixing additional carbon, stabilizing the soil with glomalin, and increasing nutrient availability for nearby plants. Many other agents contribute, from earthworms to humans as well as the charring process.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemical}} structure of charcoal in terra preta soils {{is characterized by}} poly-condensed aromatic groups, that provide prolonged biological and chemical stability against microbial degradation; it also provides, after partial oxidation, the highest nutrient retention. Low temperature charcoal (but not that from grasses or high cellulose materials) has an internal layer of biological petroleum condensates that the bacteria consume, and is similar to cellulose in its effects on <b>microbial</b> <b>growth.</b> Charring at high temperature loses that layer and brings little increase in soil fertility. The formation of condensed aromatic structures depends on the method of manufacture of charcoal. The slow oxidation of charcoal creates carboxylic groups; these increase the cations' exchange capacity of the soil. The nucleus of black carbon particles produced by the biomass remains aromatic even after thousands of years and presents the spectral characteristics of fresh charcoal. Around that nucleus and {{on the surface of}} the black carbon particles, there are higher proportions of forms of carboxylic and phenolic carbons spatially and structurally distinct from the particle's nucleus. Analysis of the groups of molecules provides evidences both for the oxidation of the black carbon particle itself, as well as for the adsorption of non-black carbon.|$|E

After the FDA Modernization Act of 1997 mandated a review and risk assessment of all mercury-containing food and drugs, vaccine manufacturers responded to FDA requests made in December 1998 and April 1999 to provide detailed information about the thiomersal content of their preparations.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this latest volume in the series “Atlases in Geosciences ” is to acquaint geologists (particularly sedimentologists) with the range {{of ways in which}} {{microbial}} mats can affect clastic sedimentation, preservation, and diagenesis. What is a microbial mat? The answer may seem obvious to anyone who has ever seen the multicolored <b>microbial</b> <b>growths</b> on the floors of hot-spring outflow systems or thick, rubbery accumulations in tidal flats or evaporative ponds, but there is actually no universally agreed-upon definition. Most microbiologists think of mats as particularly thick examples of biofilms, or communities of surface-attached micro-organisms. Biofilms can range from the thin layer of plaque currently developing on your teeth and the relatively tenuous microbial coatings that develop on any particle within a few minutes of exposure to seawater, to the more extravagant green slimes and streamers that grow on stream rocks. To a sedimentologist, a microbial mat is a community of surface-attached micro-organisms which lends cohesiveness to the associated clastic or precipitated substrate. This is a rough, pragmatic definition, but it emphasizes something significant: because an important subset of benthic microbial communities modify the material properties of siliciclastic sediments, micro...|$|R
40|$|Microcin C 7 (McC), widely {{distributed}} in enterobacteria, is a promising antibiotic against antibiotic resistance. Previous {{studies have demonstrated}} that the heptapeptide of McC is only responsible for recognizing the inner membrane transporter YejABEF to deliver McC into microbial cells, but lacks the capacity for inhibiting <b>microbial</b> cell <b>growth.</b> In this study, the effect of the heptapeptide (MR) and two analogues, N-formylated heptapeptide (f-MR) and N-aceylated heptapeptide (a-MR), on <b>microbial</b> cell <b>growth</b> were examined. It is surprising to find that MR not only inhibits the activity of intracellular -galactosidase, respiratory chain dehydrogenases, and 6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenases (6 PGDH), but it is also able to inhibit Escherichia coli growth, and eventually leads to cell death at the lethal concentration of 5. 34 mM within 10 min. The modification of MR results in a slight increase in the lethal concentration. Cell membrane integrity at the lethal concentration confirms that MR undergoes the inhibition effect, but not by destroying the cell membrane integrity. The novel property of MR provides a new insight into the Trojan horse strategy of McC and opens a new route for antibiotics design...|$|R
