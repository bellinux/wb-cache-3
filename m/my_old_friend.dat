2500|$|On the {{original}} United States and Canada pressings of Electronic Sound, {{the order of}} the recordings was accidentally switched, although the titles were not. This mistake has caused many listeners to confuse the two pieces. When the album was issued on CD {{for the first time in}} December 1996, the correct running order was used. Harrison was highly dismissive of Electronic Sound and Life with the Lions at this time. Rather than include the planned 1000-word liner note essay in the CD booklet for his album, he supplied his own text, reading simply: [...] "It could be called avant-garde, but a more apt description would be (in the words of <b>my</b> <b>old</b> <b>friend</b> Alvin), Avant Garde Clue!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Reeve {{went through}} inner anguish in the ICU, {{particularly}} {{when he was}} alone during the night. His approaching operation to reattach his skull to his spine (June 1995) [...] "was frightening to contemplate. ... I already knew that I had only a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the surgery. ... Then, at an especially bleak moment, the door flew open and in hurried a squat fellow with a blue scrub hat and a yellow surgical gown and glasses, speaking in a Russian accent." [...] The man {{announced that he was}} a proctologist and was going to perform a rectal exam on Reeve. It was Robin Williams, reprising his character from the film Nine Months. Reeve wrote: [...] "For {{the first time since the}} accident, I laughed. <b>My</b> <b>old</b> <b>friend</b> had helped me know that somehow I was going to be okay." ...|$|E
2500|$|Holmes was {{partially}} modelled on his former university teacher Joseph Bell. In 1892, {{in a letter}} to Bell, Doyle wrote, [...] "It is most certainly to you that I owe Sherlock Holmes... round the centre of deduction and inference and observation which I have heard you inculcate I have tried to build up a man," [...] and, in his 1924 autobiography, he remarked, [...] "It is no wonder that after the study of such a character [...] I used and amplified his methods when in later life I tried to build up a scientific detective who solved cases on his own merits and not through the folly of the criminal." [...] Robert Louis Stevenson was able, even in faraway Samoa, to recognise the strong similarity between Joseph Bell and Sherlock Holmes: [...] "My compliments on your very ingenious and very interesting adventures of Sherlock Holmes.... can this be <b>my</b> <b>old</b> <b>friend</b> Joe Bell?" [...] Other authors sometimes suggest additional influences—for instance, the famous Edgar Allan Poe character C. Auguste Dupin. Dr. (John) Watson owes his surname, but not any other obvious characteristic, to a Portsmouth medical colleague of Doyle's, Dr James Watson.|$|E
2500|$|Writing in The Sunday Times in 2008, Dan Cairns had suggested: [...] "many {{consider}} {{him to be}} one of the greatest bass players of all time." [...] Steve Anderson, writing in The Independent said [...] ".. he became one of the most famous and influential bass players in rock." [...] Roger Waters of Pink Floyd recently described Bruce as [...] "probably the most musically gifted bass player who's ever been." [...] Eric Clapton posted on Facebook about Bruce [...] "He was a great musician and composer, and a tremendous inspiration to me" [...] and composed an acoustic song in his honour and Ginger Baker wrote [...] "I am very sad to learn of the loss of a fine man, Jack Bruce... My thoughts and wishes are with his family at this difficult time." [...] Guitarist Leslie West, of rock group Mountain, posted on Facebook, [...] "It is with great sadness that one of the worlds greatest musicians and bass players, who I had the honor of playing with in West Bruce and Laing, Jack Bruce has died. I was hoping somehow that we might have gotten together one last time. Rest in Peace my friend." [...] Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi said on Twitter that Bruce had been his favourite bass player, saying [...] "He was a hero to so many" [...] and Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler regarded him as his [...] "biggest influence and favourite bass player". Guitarist John McLaughlin said on Twitter, [...] "Very sad to have lost <b>my</b> <b>old</b> <b>friend</b> Jack Bruce." [...] Long-standing collaborator Robin Trower wrote on Facebook, [...] "It has always been a great source of pride to me to have made music with Jack (one of the few musicians that can be truly called a force of nature) and Jack and I were proud of that music. He will be greatly missed". Fellow bassist Billy Cox also posted a tribute to Bruce on Facebook. Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Neil McCormick said, [...] "There was a time when Jack Bruce was synonymous with the bass guitar in rock history, when he was widely revered as the best there was on four strings." [...] Rush bassist and singer Geddy Lee wrote: “The sudden passing of Jack Bruce is terribly sad news. One of the greatest rock bassists to ever live and a true and profound inspiration to countless musicians. He was one of my first bass heroes and was a major influence on my playing and my music. My heartfelt condolences to his family and fans.” In March 2015, a tribute concert at London's Roundhouse scheduled for October 2015 was announced. Guest artists confirmed were, Joss Stone, Phil Manzanera, Ginger Baker, Ian Anderson and Mark King and musical director Nitin Sawhney.|$|E

2500|$|The {{project was}} {{supported}} by Pennsylvania Governor John S. Fisher and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Governor Fisher was an old friend and ally of McCreight, and together they labored for many years on the Cook Forest conservation project. [...] Both were “farm-boy” bankers who grew up near the Great Shamokin Path of the Seneca, knew the forests and believed in conservation. It was not until Fisher was elected Governor that the Cook Forest Bill was finally passed and signed on April 14, 1927. Governor Fisher supported McCreight’s proposal. “The Governor has written me that he is greatly interested {{in the use of}} the park for the home of the native Red Folks, and I think the plan can be worked out. [...] My suggestion is that Good Face, and with William Spotted Tail with his family, and John Sitting Bull, and others who would suit with <b>my</b> <b>old</b> <b>friend</b> Flying Hawk who lives at Rockyford.” McCreight, forever the dedicated public educator, saw yet another opportunity for [...] "Young America". “The Eastern people, especially the younger generation, are greatly interested in the Indians and to have a few of the old time names of whom they have read in history, it would add to their desire to know more of them. [...] Anyway, the American People owe the Indians a lot and there is nothing that I know of that would be finer, than to make a nice home for them in this great natural forest where they once lived and which was theirs before the whites came and it is the one piece of land that is just the same as it was when the original red men lived there. [...] Like all parks in the north, it would not be necessary for them to remain in it in the winter, likely they could go back and forth as it appealed to them. [...] Of course there are plenty of Indians that would be glad to get the chance to come, but not all are desired by any means. [...] I know Commissioner of Indian Affairs Charles H. Burke and will of course consult with him if the plan seems to be practical in other ways. [...] I would like, first to know whether the plan would appeal to the Indians themselves, the ones I have in mind to have for it. [...] Possibly you could see Spotted Tail too. [...] Good Face has been here before. [...] He told me he was at my house nearly thirty years ago. [...] Now that you understand what I have in mind, there are others who might be just as desirable to those mentioned, in your country, and I wish you would think about it and write me again how you regard it, and with any suggestions you might have considering the plan.” In February 1929, the Superintendent of the Pine Ridge Agency, Indian Field Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior contacted McCreight that “two families have signified their willingness to go if proper arrangements can be made and a contract and bond furnished.” [...] McCreight’s vision of Lakota living and working at Cook Forest was endorsed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and families were ready to move to the great forest along the Clarion River. However, when the stock market crashed on October 29, 1929, with the onset of the Great Depression, the Lakota project at Cook Forest was shelved.|$|E
