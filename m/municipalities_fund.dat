[...] They also {{have a right to}} collect user fees, and receive state subsidies if their tax levy is not adequate for providing the public services required, based on the demographic factors on their area. <b>Municipalities</b> <b>fund</b> the health centers on the primary care level and regional hospitals on secondary care level.

40|$|The Dutch Government has {{consistently}} pursued {{a policy of}} keeping income differences in the Dutch population moderate over the last 50 years. This policy also has a geographical component. Funds from the national <b>Municipalities</b> <b>Fund</b> are allotted to local government more or less {{on the basis of}} need. Nonetheless substantial differences in average income have emerged between central cities and suburbs during 1946 - 94. Within the group of 24 metropolitan regions there are three groups of urban regions with a distinctive pattern of central city-suburbs income differences. These patterns are clearly related to the housing strategies pursued by the various city governments over the past decades. Copyright (c) 2003 by the Royal Dutch Geographical Society KNAG. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{focusing}} on problematic concerning funding of delegated powers of a municipality. Nowadays, the delegated powers of a <b>municipality</b> are <b>funded</b> by allowance which bases on calculation of Ministry of the interior. The calculation is derived using a mechanism, reflecting a performance range of delegated powers of a municipality and therefore a total amount of allowance {{does not take into}} account actual performance. The Government does not currently have data, which would enable objective managing of funds. This problem has been solved with proposed solution of the analytical instrument, which is meant to be the support for funding. The proposed solution is consisting from four logical parts. First part is aiming on analysis of subject area and creation of strategy map according to concept Balanced Scorecard developed by Kaplan and Norton. Following part is aiming on definition set of key performance indicators and assembling of Balanced Scorecard, which is converted into a multidimensional model by Business Intelligence technologies. Data warehouse provides information to the final consumers as a set of reports created by specialized reporting instruments. Verification of proposed solution is performed by set of three pilot reports, which are designed as a decision support for problematic area. Result of this thesis is mainly verification of applicability of the proposed solution combining management concept BSC and Business Intelligence technology, in order to receive relevant information for effective managing of delegated powers of <b>municipality</b> <b>funding.</b> The final verification of applicability of the proposed solution brings the possibility of using also in other areas...|$|R
