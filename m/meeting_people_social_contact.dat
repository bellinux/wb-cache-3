40|$|For most <b>people,</b> <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> play an {{integral}} part in finding a new job. As observed by Granovetter's seminal study, the proportion of jobs obtained through <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> is usually large compared to those obtained through postings or agencies. At the same time, job markets are a natural example of two-sided matching markets. An important solution concept in such markets is that of stable matchings, {{and the use of}} the celebrated Gale-Shapley algorithm to compute them. So far, the literature has evolved separately, either focusing on the implications of information flowing through a social network, or on developing a mathematical theory of job markets through the use of two-sided matching techniques. In this paper we provide a model of the job market that brings both aspects of job markets together. To model the social scientists' observations, we assume that workers learn only about positions in firms through <b>social</b> <b>contacts.</b> Given that information structure, we study both static properties of what we call locally stable matchings (i. e., stable matchings subject to informational constraints given by a social network) and dynamic properties through a reinterpretation of Gale-Shapley's algorithm as myopic best response dynamics. We prove that, in general, the set of locally stable matching strictly contains that of stable matchings and it is in fact NP-complete to determine if they are identical. We also show that the lattice structure of stable matchings is in general absent. Finally, we focus on myopic best response dynamics inspired by the Gale-Shapley algorithm. We study the efficiency loss due to the informational constraints, providing both lower and upper bounds. Comment: 19 pages.

However, the variety of activities that older and younger people do also differs.

40|$|This study {{examines}} how young <b>people</b> use <b>social</b> media {{to establish and}} maintain social relations. By conducting in-depth interviews with eight 17 -year olds, I investigate young people’s own experiences and use of Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram. I find that different social media have different functions suitable for building and maintaining social relations. Based on the interviews, previous research and sociological theory, I focus on three topics. First, I investigate who the informants include in their networks. The data shows that the networks in the social media consists of different groups of people. While Facebook includes both weak and strong connections, Snapchat consists of close relations. On Instagram they have either one user with both near and far acquaintances, or two separate users. The second user are private, and are shared only with close friends. On this basis, I suggest that the different social media touch upon different parts of teenagers’ social network. This is the basis for understanding how teenagers both build and maintain social relations. The second topic in this thesis examines how young <b>people</b> are building <b>social</b> relations in social media. Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram are used in different ways {{to get in touch with}} new <b>people.</b> The <b>social</b> <b>contact</b> that occurs in social media can develop into social relations. I find that most of these new acquaintances remain in social media. Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram can help reconnecting with old acquaintances and help young people to get to know each other. I find that social media are important social arenas for young <b>people.</b> Lasting <b>social</b> relations require maintenance. The third topic is about how young <b>people</b> use <b>social</b> media to maintain social relationships. Based on the interviews, I identify six strategies: keeping in touch by conversations, giving others attention, taking initiative, highlighting friendships, keeping updated in the lives of others, and following norms. The study shows that these strategies are prominent in the different social medias. This is closely related to the functions available through the specific media.

40|$|Objectives. Although {{there are}} {{numerous}} studies {{on the role of}} social connections in early working life, research that examines how social connectedness matters in the later stages of a career is scarce. The present study analyzes to what extent social connectedness affects the timing of the transition from work to retirement. Methods. We draw on data from the German Socioeconomic Panel Study (GSOEP) from the years 1985 - 2009 (N = 10, 225), and we apply techniques of event history analysis. Social connectedness includes social gatherings with friends, relatives, and neighbors (informal participation) as well as engagement in voluntary and civic associations and local politics (formal participation). Results. The findings demonstrate that social connectedness matters for the transition from work to retirement, but its impact depends on the type of participation. Whereas informal participation results in earlier retirement, formal participation delays labor force withdrawal. Discussion. The findings suggest a trade-off between informal participation and work in later life, which leads <b>people</b> with frequent <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> to opt for early retirement. By contrast, the fact that formal participation is associated with postponed retirement points to employment benefits of volunteering and civic engagement among older workers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: Depressive {{symptoms}} in elderly patients are common. However diagnosing, treating and preventing depression {{in this group}} is far from adequate. Recommending <b>social</b> <b>contact</b> to elderly patients is {{an effective way to}} reduce loneliness and depressive symptoms, and increase quality of life. Since depressive elderly patients prefer to be treated in primary care, the role of general practitioner (GP) in recommending <b>social</b> <b>contact</b> is crucial. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this project is to identify GPs’ focus on <b>social</b> <b>contact</b> regarding elderly patients with depression, to assess factors that might affect their practices on recommending <b>social</b> <b>contact</b> and identify the elderly patients’ experience of <b>social</b> <b>contact</b> and loneliness. METHODS: A cross-sectional study in which data were collected by interviewing GPs, or through questionnaires filled by GPs. Different questionnaires were filled by the patients. A qualitative study was also conducted to assess factors that affect GPs’ practices. We based this on previously identified determinants of adherence to the recommendation regarding <b>social</b> <b>contact.</b> RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-four GPs participated in the study. They recommended <b>social</b> <b>contact</b> for 279 (88 %) of 316 patients. Eighty of 134 patients (60 %) felt loneliness several times in the past month. The qualitative interviews showed that to some degree all identified factors affected the practices on this recommendation. CONCLUSIONS: Though a great number of patients are recommended <b>social</b> <b>contact,</b> the percentage of loneliness among depressive patients remains high. The factors affecting recommendation of <b>social</b> <b>contact</b> remains an important barrier for general practitioners. This stresses the need for improving <b>social</b> <b>contact</b> and reducing loneliness in elderly patients with depression...|$|R

This study aimed to assess whether the life expectancy gain associated with <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> over a long follow up differs for Blacks and Whites. Methods. Data came from the Americans’ Changing Lives (ACL) Study, 1986 – 2011. The sample was a nationally representative sample of American adults 25 and older, who were followed for up to 25 years (n = 3361). Outcome was all-cause mortality. The main predictor was <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> defined as number of regular visits with friends, relatives, and neighbors. Baseline demographics (age and gender), socioeconomic status (education, income, and employment), health behaviors (smoking and drinking), and health (chronic medical conditions, obesity, and depressive symptoms) were controlled. Race was the focal moderator. Cox proportional hazard models were used in the pooled sample and based on race. Results. More <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> predicted higher life expectancy in the pooled sample. A significant interaction was found between race and <b>social</b> <b>contacts,</b> suggesting that the protective effect of more <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> is smaller for Blacks than Whites.

5000|$|Deemed as a {{developmental}} challenge of epidemic proportions, the double {{burden of disease}} (DBD) is an emerging global health challenge, that exists predominately in low-to-middle income countries. More specifically, the DBD refers to the dual burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases(NCD). Today, over 90 per cent of the world’s disease burden occurs in developing regions, and most are attributed to communicable diseases. Communicable diseases are infectious diseases that “can be passed between <b>people</b> through proximity, <b>social</b> <b>contact</b> or intimate contact.” [...] Common diseases in this category include whooping cough or tuberculosis, HIV/AIDs, malaria, influenza (the flu), and mumps. [...] As low-to-middle income countries continue to develop, the types of diseases that affecting populations within these countries shifts primarily from infectious diseases, such as diarrhea and pneumonia, to primarily non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and obesity. This shift is increasingly being {{referred to as the}} risk transition. [...] Thus, as globalization and the proliferation of pre-packaged foods continues, traditional diets and lifestyles are changing in many developing countries. As such, it is becoming increasingly common to see low-to-middle income countries battle with century old issues such as food insecurity and under nutrition, in addition to emerging health epidemics such as chronic heart disease, hypertension, stroke, and diabetes. Diseases once characteristic of industrialized nations, are increasingly becoming health challenges of epidemic proportions in many low-to-middle income countries.|$|R

The extent of individual <b>social</b> <b>contacts,</b> however, varies considerably between countries. We study why countries differ in amounts of <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> of older adults. Using theory on income inequality and neo-materialism, we expect the amount of <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> of older <b>people</b> to be highest in countries with low income inequality and comprehensive welfare spending. Furthermore, we hypothesize {{that the impact of}} country characteristics on <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> differs with individual income and age.

Cross-national comparison of 27 European countries is realized through linear and logistic multilevel modelling. The results reveal partial support for our expectations. Income inequality and old-age poverty reduce the likelihood of having a close contact. Welfare spending, specifically expenditure on care for older adults and health services, has the potential to cancel out some of these negative effects. However, there were only small differences between age groups. The implications of these findings are being discussed...|$|R

25|$|The term shyness may be {{implemented}} as a lay blanket-term {{for a family}} of related and partially overlapping afflictions, including timidity (apprehension in <b>meeting</b> new <b>people),</b> bashfulness and diffidence (reluctance in asserting oneself), apprehension and anticipation (general fear of potential interaction), or intimidation (relating to the object of fear rather than one's low confidence). Apparent shyness, as perceived by others, may simply be the manifestation of reservation or introversion, character traits which cause an individual to voluntarily avoid excessive <b>social</b> <b>contact</b> or be terse in communication, but are not motivated or accompanied by discomfort, apprehension, or lack of confidence.|$|R

Hence <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> can {{generate}} mismatch between a worker’s occupational choice and his comparative productive advantage. Thus economies with dense social networks can exhibit apparently low labor force quality and, as a result, low returns to firms’ investment and depressed aggregate productivity. We employ US and European data for the 1990 ’s to test the key prediction that <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> distort workers’ occupational choices in a direction that reduces their apparent productivity. We find that the use of <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> helps …nd jobs one to two months sooner but leads to individual wage discounts of 5 % to 7 % and produces negative externalities on aggregate productivity...|$|R

Occupational Choice and <b>Social</b> <b>Contacts</b> Across Regions This paper tests the relative importance of strong versus weak social ties on self-employment. Strong ties arising from frequent interaction should create trust that facilitates resource mobilization. To measure differences in <b>social</b> <b>contacts,</b> we compare the impact of club memberships on the likelihood of being self-employed in peripheral and agglomerated areas. In peripheral areas, we expect that more membership overlappings will lead to stronger ties. Analyzing the different impact of <b>social</b> <b>contacts</b> on becoming self-employed across regions, we find that strengthening social ties increases the likelihood of being self-employed by 1. 9 to 14. 2 percentage points, depending on the number of underlying <b>social</b> <b>contacts.</b> These results remain robust after applying matching techniques...|$|R

The objectives {{of the current study}} are to explore the dimensions of tourist-host <b>social</b> <b>contact</b> and to contribute to the theory of tourist typology according to their dynamic nature in tourist-host social interaction. Forty-five in-depth interviews were conducted to generate insightful information. The software of NVivo 10 was applied to examine and code the transcripts. As a result, six dimensions were adopted to describe tourist-host <b>social</b> <b>contact,</b> which are purposes, determinants, activities, intensity, impacts and attitudes. Five types of tourists were pinpointed and theoretical and practical contributions of the study were discussed.

Traditional offline epidemic control methods (e. g., using medical survey or medical records) or model-based approach are not effective {{due to its}} inability to gather health data and <b>social</b> <b>contact</b> information simultaneously or impractical statistical assumption about the dynamics of <b>social</b> <b>contact</b> networks, respectively. In addition, {{it is challenging to}} find optimal sets of people to be isolated to contain the spread of epidemics for large populations due to high computational complexity. Unlike these approaches, in this paper, a novel cluster-based epidemic control scheme is proposed based on Smartphonebased body area networks. The proposed scheme divides the populations into multiple clusters based on their physical location and <b>social</b> <b>contact</b> information. The proposed control schemes are applied within the cluster or between clusters. Further, we develop a computational efficient approach called UGP to enable an effective cluster-based quarantine strategy using graph theory for large scale networks (i. e., populations). The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated through both simulations and experiments on real <b>social</b> <b>contact</b> networks...|$|R
