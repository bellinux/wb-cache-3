50|$|It is a pale {{golden colour}} when young, {{taking on a}} rich amber hue over time and often {{improving}} with age. Wine connoisseurs appreciated Saint-Veran's qualities before the appellation was officially recognized. With its complex, ample and elegant bouquet, this typical Burgundy wine offers round, powerful flavours on the palate. Depending on the year and the batch, one can detect fruity notes of white peach, apple or pear, or floral notes of lime-blossom or acacia that give way, over time, to notes of hazelnut or almond, offset by delicate touches of honey, vanilla and flint. It can for example be matched with chicken in a cream sauce, veal sweetbreads or fish. Saint-Véran should be served at around 11 °C and is best opened a few <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> being <b>served,</b> allowing time for the full richness of its aroma to be released.|$|R

50|$|The dish is {{a famous}} soup, and often {{consumed}} by tourists and locals. An important ingredient in Fisherman's Soup {{is in the}} court bouillon, which adds significant flavor. To prepare the soup base, fish trimmings are used, fresh carp heads, bones, skin and fins. These are boiled with water, salt and vegetables (red onions, green peppers and tomatoes) for two hours. When ready, the court bouillon is strained. Hot ground paprika and two finger-thick carp fillets, the roe and coral is added, ten <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>serving,</b> to the boiling soup.|$|E
50|$|Suet pastry {{is used to}} line a bowl {{into which}} the steak and kidney mix is placed with onions, stock etc. A suet pastry lid is then placed on top and sealed tightly. The top is then covered with muslin cloth which is tied round the bowl. This is placed in a covered {{saucepan}} and steamed for about four hours or until the pudding is cooked. Some recipes then stipulate making a small opening in the top and pouring rich stock into the pudding ten <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>serving.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the mid-2010s malatang shops {{became popular}} in North China, {{especially}} Beijing. In these shops the ingredients are usually displayed on shelves, and customers pick their desired ingredients into a bowl. Behind the counter the selected ingredients are cooked in a spicy broth, usually {{at very high}} temperature for 3-4 <b>minutes.</b> <b>Before</b> <b>serving,</b> malatang is typically further seasoned with lots of garlic, black pepper, Sichuan pepper, chili pepper, sesame paste and crushed peanuts. The price {{is calculated based on}} the weight of the self-picked ingredients. In Beijing half a kilogramm usually costs between 15-20 RMB as of November 2015.|$|E

50|$|Tea making {{techniques}} {{vary from}} home to home, and person to person, but tea is typically made from loose tea leaves and steeped {{for a couple of}} <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>serving.</b> A teapot and tea cosy may be used, if time permits, or tea may be steeped directly in the kettle off the heat. After steeping, the tea is poured into cups through a strainer. Milk may be added before or after the tea, but sugar is typically offered separately so that each individual may add sugar according to his or her own taste. Teabags are usually reserved for when time constraints do not enable one to prepare tea from loose tea leaves.|$|E
5000|$|An easier {{version is}} to boil {{the milk and}} add bread crumbs, mawa (dried whole milk), and sugar while stirring. The cream layer formed on the boiling milk is scooped {{initially}} and added in the end to thicken the milk. More recently Kulfi is prepared from evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk and heavy (double) cream. [...] Then sugar is added and the mixture is further boiled and cornstarch-water paste is added. This paste thickens the mixture, although it is boiled for an additional few minutes. Then flavourings, dried fruits, cardamom, etc. are added. The mixture is then cooled, put in moulds and frozen. If frozen in individual-portion custard bowls for service with a spoon, bowls are removed from the freezer 10-15 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>serving</b> to allow for melting at the edges.|$|E
5000|$|Yufka {{is a type}} of Turkish bread. It is a thin, round, and unleavened flat bread {{similar to}} lavash, about 18 inches (40-50 cm) in {{diameter}} usually made from wheat flour, water and table salt. After kneading, the dough is allowed to rest for 30 min. Dough pieces (ca. 5-6 oz/150-200 g) are rounded and rolled into a circular sheet. The sheets of yufka dough are baked on a heated iron plate called a sac in Turkish [...] Baking time is approximately 2-3 minutes. During baking, the bread is turned over once to brown the other side. After baking, yufka bread has a low moisture content, and depending on how low the moisture is, a long shelf life. Before consumption, dry yufka bread is sprayed with warm water. The moistened bread is covered with a cotton cloth and is rested for 10 to 12 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> <b>serving.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractAcute lung {{injury is}} an {{inflammatory}} syndrome {{that increases the}} permeability of the blood-gas barrier, resulting in high morbidity and mortality. Despite intensive research, treatment options remain limited. We investigated the protective efficacy of tezosentan, a novel, dual endothelin receptor antagonist, in an experimental model of alpha-naphthylthiourea (ANTU) -induced acute lung injury in rats. ANTU was intraperitoneally (i. p.) injected into rats at a dose of 10  mg/kg. Tezosentan was injected 30 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> ANTU was subcutaneously (s. c.) injected at doses of 2, 10, or 30  mg/kg, 60 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> ANTU was injected at doses of 2, 10, or 30  mg/kg (i. p.), and 90 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> ANTU at a dose of 10  mg/kg (i. p.). Four hours later, the lung weight/body weight (LW/BW) ratio and pleural effusion (PE) were measured. When injected 30 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> ANTU at doses of 2, 10, or 30  mg/kg (s. c.), tezosentan {{had no effect on}} lung pathology. When injected 60 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> ANTU at doses of 2, 10, or 30  mg/kg (i. p.) or 90 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> ANTU (10  mg/kg, i. p.), tezosentan significantly decreased the PE/BW ratio and had a prophylactic effect on PE formation at all doses. Therefore, tezosentan may attenuate lung injury. Furthermore, its acute and inhibitory effects on fluid accumulation were more effective in the pleural cavity than in the interstitial compartment in this experimental model...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesGuidelines {{recommend}} {{antibiotic prophylaxis}} 60 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> skin incision; however, {{it is unclear}} whether more precise timing would further reduce sternal wound infection. Our objectives were {{to examine the relationship between}} antibiotic timing and infection, test potential efficacy of optimal antibiotic timing in preventing infection, and determine whether patient comorbidity is related to timing and infection. MethodsFrom 1 / 1 / 1995 – 1 / 1 / 2008, 28, 250 patients underwent 28, 702 cardiac surgical procedures involving a median sternotomy; 85 % received only cefuroxime and 15 % received only vancomycin prophylaxis. Multivariable analysis identified factors associated with infection within each phase, and risk-adjusted optimal timing was determined using patient data, risk variables, and hypothetical values of antibiotic timing. ResultsPrevalence of sternal wound infection was 2. 0 % (489 patients) for cefuroxime and 2. 3 % (101 patients) for vancomycin. Minimum prevalence for infection was 1. 8 % observed when cefuroxime was administered 15 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> incision; risk increased to 2. 2 % with administration more than 45 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> incision and to 2. 8 % at 60 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> incision. Minimum prevalence of infection in patients who received vancomycin was 1. 8 % observed with initiation 32 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> incision; risk increased to 2. 2 % for administration 45 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> incision and 3. 2 % with administration 60 <b>minutes</b> <b>before</b> incision. Simulation for optimal timing found that it was influenced by phase-specific risk factors. ConclusionsRefining current antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines may lower sternal wound infections. Antibiotic administration timing resulting in lowest likelihood for infection varied with antibiotic and patient-specific factors. Optimal risk-adjusted timing could potentially reduce infections by 9 %- 31 %...|$|R
