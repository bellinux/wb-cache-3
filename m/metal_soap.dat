40|$|<b>Metal</b> <b>soap</b> {{efflorescent}} hazes and crusts {{are one of}} {{the most}} visually disturbing of all <b>metal</b> <b>soap</b> related alterations in paintings. The phenomenon presents particular challenges for conservators as the surface deposits that form are insoluble and intimately bound with the paint film. The superficial deposits accumulate following migration of metal carboxylates, a product formed within the paint film from reaction of free fatty acids with metal ions from pigments and/or driers. Upon deposition at the surface, the metal carboxylates undergo a process of remineralisation, the products of which are determined by the atmospheric conditions that the painting is exposed to. The material can appear optically similar to the whitish haze of organic efflorescence though manifestations also range from crystalline clusters to thick crusts, and in some cases the painting may consequently be rendered partially unreadable. This study aimed to investigate the removal of visually disturbing lead soap efflorescence with Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), which sequesters the lead ions from the remineralised crust. Through a careful balance of variables such as pH, concentration and application, it is feasible to thin the superficial material significantly. By this means it is possible to saturate the surface of the paint film and render the previously disfiguring efflorescence transparent.

40|$|Abstract. During {{the process}} of cold forming of aluminum, the high {{pressure}} which is introduced on the die can result in high adhesion between the aluminum and the die surface. Therefore, {{it is necessary for}} the aluminum billet to be coated with a lubricant prior to forming, to reduce adhesion and to ease the flow of material in the die. There are several popular types of lubricant systems used in cold forging of aluminum. For severe deformation, conversion coating in conjunction with soap lubricant are commonly used. The conversion coatings include soap phosphates (PO 4 -soap), as well as soap aluminum fluoride (AlF-soap). Therefore, this work studied the performance of the AlF-soap system and compared it to the conventional PO 4 -soap system as tested on AA 6063 aluminum. Ring compression tests and ball on disc tests were conducted to explore friction conditions and the thinning of the lubricant under several forming conditions. It was found that the quantity of <b>metal</b> <b>soap</b> layer of AlF-soap used affected the friction coefficient and the lubricant thinning under forming operation.

40|$|International audienceThe origin(s) and role(s) of <b>metal</b> <b>soaps</b> in paints are a {{worldwide}} concern today. These hybrid compounds, containing both fatty acid chains and metals {{associated with a}} carboxylate function, are increasingly identified in paints. As reviewed {{in the first part}} of this work, the presence of <b>metal</b> <b>soaps</b> in paints is differently interpreted in scientific publications: <b>metal</b> <b>soaps</b> are sometimes considered to play a positive role as anchor points, during paint drying processes; they can also be considered as responsible for many degradation processes (protrusions, efflorescences, darkening, etc.). Their origins are also interpreted in various ways. In some paintings (in particular from the twentieth century), they have sometimes introduced on purpose, as additives, to modify the physical properties of the painting materials. In older paintings, <b>metal</b> <b>soaps</b> are usually thought to result from an uncontrolled reaction of oil with lead-based pigments, in particular lead white, red lead, and lead tin yellow. In the second part of this work, the review of historical recipes of lead-based paint shows an important number of recipes based on controlled mixing of oil with lead driers. In the third part, the experimental reproduction of such traditional recipes using walnut oil and litharge (PbO) shows that lead soaps can be formed, both in about one hour at ∼ 100 °C, or in about one month at room temperature. It shows as well that after a few years, litharge is no longer detected in the paint medium, while different lead carbonates are. Finally, the micro-infrared spectroscopy and micro-X-ray diffraction re-analysis of protrusions from a nine-year model painting shows together with lead soaps, the presence of Pb 5 (CO 3) 3 (OH) 2 O (‘synthetic plumbonacrite’), an unusual phase recently observed in a protrusion from a painting by Vincent Van Gogh. This work highlights (i) the multiple origins and roles of <b>metal</b> <b>soaps</b> in paints and (ii) the importance of combining the analysis of fragments from historical paintings with the analysis and reproduction of historical recipes. In particular, we show that the components detected today in historical paintings may severely differ from those originally used or prepared by the painter, complicating the assessment of the painter's intentions.

Low molecular weight compounds were mixed with polymers where the process viscosity is reduced at process temperatures and mechanical properties are improved once the material system is cooled or reacted. Thermally induced phase separation and thermotropic phase transformation of low molar mass compounds were used in isotactic polypropylene (iPP) and poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) resins. Reaction induced phase separation was utilized in thermosets to generate anisotropic reinforcements. ^ A new strategy to increase fracture toughness of materials was introduced. Simultaneously, enhancement in stiffness and reduction in process viscosity were also attained. Materials with improved rheological and mechanical properties were prepared by using thermotropic phase transformations of <b>metal</b> <b>soaps</b> in polymers (calcium stearate/iPP). Morphology and thermal properties were studied using WAXS, DSC and SEM. Mechanical and rheological investigation showed significant reduction in process viscosity and substantial improvement in fracture toughness were attained. ^ Effects of molecular architecture of <b>metal</b> <b>soaps</b> were investigated in PEEK (calcium stearate/PEEK and sodium stearate/PEEK). The selected compounds reduced the process viscosity due to the high temperature co-continuous morphology of <b>metal</b> <b>soaps.</b> Unlike the iPP system that incorporates spherical particles, interaction between PEEK and <b>metal</b> <b>soaps</b> resulted in two discrete and co-continuous phases of PEEK and the metal stearates.

Miscible blends of DMS and DGEBA/mPDA form homogenous mixtures that undergo polymerization induced phase separation, once the DGEBA oligomers react with mPDA.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{demonstrates}} a new method {{to extract the}} friction stress τ from measurements in wire drawing. It is based on simultaneous measurement of drawing force and die temperature; an analytical thermo-mechanical model of the wire drawing operation is used to separate the plastic work Wpl from the frictional work. Thanks to the exploitation of the temperature measurement, the necessity to know the stress-strain curve of the drawn metal beforehand is avoided. This new approach is compared with the more traditional one, in which only the force is measured and friction is extracted by inverse modelling using an experimentally determined stress-strain curve. Drawing experiments have been performed on stainless steel wire, using dies in which thermocouples have been inserted. The linearity of the measured drawing stress-measured die temperature relation is a first confirmation of the model. On the other hand, stress-strain curves have been measured at both low and high strain rates in the [20 - 150 °C] range, and {{used to compare the}} identified values of Wpl both with analytical estimations and numerical simulations of wire drawing; again, the thermo-mechanical model has been confirmed.

Visually, {{changes in the}} appearance of an oil painting might be very slow, but {{over the course of}} centuries, chemical reactions and physical processes do affect the colour, texture and integrity of oil paint layers. This thesis aims to expand our knowledge of the molecular structure of oil paint and the potential changes to this structure during the life of a painting. Specifically, the issue of <b>metal</b> <b>soap</b> formation—complexes of metal ions and long-chain fatty acids—is a central topic. These complexes can form large crystalline aggregates that protrude through the paint surface, and have been related to cases of brittleness, transparency and delamination in oil paint layers.

Chapters 4 and 5 contain studies into the different types of zinc carboxylates observed in FTIR spectra of oil paints, and show that certain common pigments leach metal ions that are subsequently bound to carboxylate functionalities on the polymerised oil network. A synthetic model of this ionomerlike state was used to study solvent diffusion and the crystallisation of metal soaps after exposure to fatty acids with time-dependent FTIR spectrometry in Chapter 6.

Spectroscopic (fluorescence, Fourier-transform infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance) studies on PVC itself, and model compounds of PVC impurities (e. g. 4 -chloro- 2 -hexene) have shown two distinct modes of action: in which a metal complex between the costabiliser and a <b>metal</b> <b>soap</b> stabiliser (zinc stearate and calcium stearate is the active entity, one in which costabiliser action is facilitated by release of zinc chloride. F 6 was shown to substitute for allylic chloride by a C-alkylation reaction so inhibiting polyene formation and giving very good initial colour. It was demonstrated that F 6 formed a complex with the zinc stearate at room temperature to give a chelate in which the zinc ion is tetracoordinated. Because the costabiliser is able to co-ordinate readily to zinc stearate, this leads to good initial colour, but a more rapid evolution of HCl ('short-term' costabilisation). When the -C=O substituent in the 3 -position {{was replaced by a}} '-C=N-alkyl' (F 6 d), or a '-C=N-phenyl' (F 6 c) group, the behaviour was changed markedly. FTIR and HCl evolution showed that F 6 d was unstable at 180 deg. C and reacted with HCl evolved from the degraded PVC, decomposing into a basic gas and a structure similar to F 6. F 6 d being more basic formed a complex with the Lewis acid ZnCI_ 2 instead of zinc stearate. F 6 c did not interact with the ZnCl_ 2 or ZnSt_ 2, {{despite the fact that it}} has an extra nitrogen atom. The reason for this is that the #pi# orbital system of the N-substituted phenyl ring in the 3 -position in the pyrrolidine ring is conjugated with the C=N double bond. DHA also interacted with the zinc stearate, but this interaction was significant only at higher temperatures, i. e. after heating to processing temperatures. The synergistic action of R 83 was considered to arise from its ability to form a stable complex with the metal chloride, so protecting against the prodegradant action of the metal chloride (hence 'long-term' costabilisation).

The spectrum of a sample from P 4 showed two strong sharp bands between 1500 and 1600  cm− 1 one at around 1586 and another at 1538  cm− 1 as a result of COO- asymmetric stretching associated with calcium soaps [20, 21].

30|$|Many {{studies have}} shown that {{long-chain}} carboxylates, or soaps, of polyvalent metal ions are effective precursors for the large-scale synthesis of metal oxide or metal nanoparticles (NP) via a thermal decomposition process utilizing organic solvents [1 – 8]. Of these various soaps, those containing iron have attracted particular attention due to the magnetic properties bestowed in the products. For example, iron (ferrous or ferric) fatty acid complexes (IFACs) have been used to synthesize monodisperse iron oxides and iron NPs at different decomposition temperatures using various types of solvent [9 – 15] and without the presence of any form of solvent [16 – 18], respectively. The NPs produced using these techniques have a uniform size and are widely applied in a broad range of fields such as magnetic storage media, drug carriers, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) agents, and hyperthermia [19, 20]. Moreover, the size of the NPs can easily be tuned by adjusting the reaction parameters, e.g. the reaction temperature (as determined by the solvent b.p.) or the concentration of the free fatty acid within the reactant. Polyvalent metal soaps are generally prepared via one of three different routes, namely, (1) metathesis of the corresponding soap of Na or K with metal salts (such as chloride or acetate) in aqueous or nonaqueous polar solvents; (2) fusion (or dissolution) of metal oxides, hydroxides, oxy-hydroxides, hydroxycarbonates, or carbonates in hot fatty acids; and (3) direct reaction of metals with hot fatty acids [21]. The <b>metal</b> <b>soap</b> precursors used for the synthesis of iron oxide or iron NPs are generally prepared using the route 1 method [1 – 18]. However, it has also been shown that the route 2 method is well suited to the preparation of soaps containing elements such as alkaline, alkaline earth metal, Zn, Cd, and so on [22 – 26]. Jana et al. [27] demonstrated the use of iron oxides as precursors in the synthesis of metal oxide NPs. However, they did not provide any experimental details due to the poor reproducibility of the resulting precipitates. Yu et al. [28] proposed a one-pot process for the preparation of monodisperse magnetite NPs, in which an amorphous iron oxyhydroxide, known as 2 -line ferrihydrite, is fully dissolved in a mixture of oleic acid and 1 -octadecene solvent at a temperature of 320 °C. In a recent study, the current group demonstrated the feasibility of dissolving hematite in hot long-chain fatty acids such as oleic acid or linoleic acid to produce IFACs for the synthesis of monodisperse magnetic iron oxide NPs via a controlled dissolution–recrystallization process [29]. However, the preparation of IFACs using the route 2 method requires an elevated reaction temperature, which causes the IFACs to decompose virtually as soon as they are formed. Therefore, in synthesizing IFACs using this route, the challenge lies in finding a temperature that is sufficiently high to ensure the complete dissolution of the hematite powder in the hot fatty acid while simultaneously avoiding the decomposition of the resulting IFACs. Assuming that such a temperature can be found, the possibility then exists to synthesize IFACs in a cheap and efficient manner using readily available hematite powder. Furthermore, having prepared the IFACs, iron oxide NPs of a specified size can easily be synthesized via a decomposition process performed using a solvent with an appropriate boiling point.|$|E

40|$|Preparation and {{characterization}} of pure <b>metal</b> <b>soaps</b> and investigation of {{their effects on}} poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) dehydrochlorination were {{the objectives of the}} present study. Magnesium stearate (MgSt 2), cobalt stearate (CoSt 2), and copper stearate (CuSt 2) were prepared by a precipitation method. An aqueous sodium stearate (NaSt) solution was mixed at 500 rpm with respective metal salt solutions at 75 oC. The precipitates that formed were collected by filtration, washed with water, and ultimately dried at 105 oC under reduced pressure. Lamellar crystals that melted on heating were obtained. Solid-liquid phase transitions were observed by optical microscopy at 160 oC, 159 oC, and 117 oC for MgSt 2, CoSt 2, and CuSt 2, respectively. However, the melting points of MgSt 2, CoSt 2, and CuSt 2 were determined as 115 oC, 159 oC, and 111 oC, respectively, by analysis by differential scanning calorimetry. The onset temperature of the mass loss was the lowest at 255 oC for CuSt 2 and the lowest activation energy for thermal decomposition was 18 kJ/mol for CuSt 2. CoSt 2 was effective in extending the induction time of PVC dehydrochlorination at both 140 oC and 160 oC. The activation energy calculated from stability time decreased from 175 kJ/mol for a blank PVC sample to 114, 105, and 107 kJ/mol for MgSt 2, CoSt 2, and CuSt 2 -containing PVC samples, respectively.

The series of experiments was performed on a Nonotribometer in material combination of sapphire ball on steel disks with a range of normal loads from 1 up to 500 mN. Results directly show influences of the bulk grease components on frictional and wear behavior. Comparison of frictional and wear results makes manifest that, while in most combinations of base oil and thickener, the highest influence is found in the thickening agent, some combinations are mainly influenced by the base oil.
