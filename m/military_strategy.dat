5|$|<b>Military</b> <b>strategy</b> and {{military}} training {{were treated as}} sciences that could be studied and perfected; soldiers were tested in their skills of using weaponry and in their athletic ability. The troops were trained to follow signal standards to advance at the waving of banners and to halt {{at the sound of}} bells and drums.|$|E
5|$|The campaign's {{ultimate}} limitation was {{the poor}} formulation of <b>military</b> <b>strategy.</b> The types of targets selected from one operation {{to the next}} differed radically and no sustained pressure was put on any one type of British target. The Luftwaffes strategy became increasingly aimless. Disputes among the OKL staff revolved more around tactics than strategy. This method condemned the offensive over Britain to failure before it had begun.|$|E
5|$|Brodie was {{a native}} of Chicago, the son of Latvian Jewish {{immigrants}} who was alienated from both his family and his family's religion. A bright, emotional graduate student in international relations, Brodie eventually became a noted expert in <b>military</b> <b>strategy</b> during the Cold War era. The McKays were horrified at their daughter's impending marriage; Dilworth Jensen felt betrayed. David O. McKay went to Chicago to warn his niece of the family's strong objections. Out of consideration for her mother, Fawn scheduled the wedding in an LDS chapel, but of the McKays, only Fawn's mother attended. None of Brodie's family did.|$|E

5|$|During that month, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad {{indicated}} {{his intentions}} {{of going to}} war against Israel. Egypt and Syria agreed to coordinate military action via negotiations, and the respective Ministers of War formulated a common <b>military</b> <b>strategy.</b> Egypt enlisted the political support of several more Arab countries, some producers of oil. Sadat discussed {{the possibility of using}} oil as an economic weapon to pressure Western governments into adopting more pro-Arab policies. During the war, oil-producing Arab nations, primarily Libya and Saudi Arabia, initiated an oil embargo, and several sent token forces to the front lines.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} years of World WarII, Australia's <b>{{military}}</b> <b>strategy</b> was closely aligned with that of the United Kingdom. In line with this, most Australian military units deployed overseas in 1940 and 1941 were sent to the Mediterranean and Middle East where they formed {{a key part of the}} Commonwealth forces in the area. The three AIF infantry divisions sent to the Middle East saw extensive action, as did the RAAF squadrons and warships in this theatre.|$|E

5|$|The Belgian {{strategy}} for a defence against German aggression faced political {{as well as}} military problems. In terms of <b>military</b> <b>strategy,</b> the Belgians were unwilling to stake everything on a linear defence of the Belgian–German border, in an extension of the Maginot Line. Such a move would leave the Belgians vulnerable to a German assault in their rear, through an attack on the Netherlands. Such a strategy would also rely on the French to move quickly into Belgium and support the garrison there.|$|E
5|$|The French <b>military</b> <b>strategy</b> against Austria {{was for a}} three-pronged {{invasion}} {{to surround}} Vienna, ideally capturing the city and forcing the Holy Roman Emperor into a surrender and acceptance of French Revolutionary ideals. The French assembled the Army of Sambre and Meuse commanded by Jean Baptiste Jourdan against the Austrian Army of the Lower Rhine in the north; the Army of the Rhine and Moselle, led by Jean Victor Marie Moreau, opposed the Austrian Army of the Upper Rhine {{in the south and}} the Army of Italy commanded by Napoleon Bonaparte approached Vienna through northern Italy.|$|E

In taking Tjaru he cut off all traffic between Canaan and Avaris. This indicates he was planning a blockade of Avaris, isolating the Hyksos capital from help or supplies coming from Canaan.|$|E

5|$|Until the 1970s, Australia's <b>{{military}}</b> <b>strategy</b> {{centred on}} the concept of Forward Defence, in which the role of Australian military and naval forces were to co-operate with Allied forces to counter threats in Australia's region. Following the adoption of the Guam Doctrine by the United States in 1969, and the British withdrawal 'east of Suez' in the early 1970s, Australia developed a defence policy emphasising self-reliance and the defence of the Australian continent. Known as the Defence of Australia Policy, it focused Australian defence planning on protecting the nation's northern maritime approaches (the 'air-sea gap') against possible attack.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Fort Sumter, Lincoln {{realized}} {{the importance of}} taking immediate executive control {{of the war and}} making an overall Union <b>military</b> <b>strategy</b> to put down the rebellion. Lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis, and he responded as commander-in-chief, using unprecedented powers. He expanded his war powers, and imposed a blockade on all the Confederate shipping ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, and after suspending habeas corpus, arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers. Lincoln was supported by Congress and the northern public for these actions. In addition, Lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong Union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict.|$|E

5|$|As {{a general}} officer, {{he served as}} Commandant General Royal Marines, the {{professional}} head of the Royal Marines and a dual-hatted appointment with Commander UK Amphibious Forces, for two years. While in this post, Dutton returned to Iraq to command Multi-national Division (South-East) in 2005, where he attracted media attention through outspoken remarks alleging Iranian support for the insurgents in Iraq. His last field post, as a lieutenant general, was as Deputy Commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. He held the position from 2008 to 2009, during {{the peak of the}} Taliban insurgency, and assisted American General Stanley A. McChrystal, then commander of ISAF, in redesigning the <b>military</b> <b>strategy</b> to combat the insurgency. Dutton retired in 2010 but was later appointed Governor of Gibraltar, taking up office on 6 December 2013, where he retired early, in September 2015.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{detailed}} invasion {{plans were}} {{drawn up by}} the Germans, but Switzerland was never attacked. Switzerland was able to remain independent {{through a combination of}} military deterrence, concessions to Germany, and good fortune as larger events during the war delayed an invasion. Under General Henri Guisan central command, a general mobilisation of the armed forces was ordered. The Swiss <b>military</b> <b>strategy</b> was changed from one of static defence at the borders to protect the economic heartland, to one of organised long-term attrition and withdrawal to strong, well-stockpiled positions high in the Alps known as the Reduit. Switzerland was an important base for espionage by both sides in the conflict and often mediated communications between the Axis and Allied powers.|$|E
5|$|Eisenhower favored Shoup {{because he}} feared other {{officers}} {{spent too much}} time in political affairs, and felt Shoup would reduce the influence of the military industrial complex. Immediately after his appointment, Shoup sought to place new officers in key positions, in an attempt to overhaul the leadership of the Marine Corps. He and Pate disagreed over some of the new appointments, as Shoup transferred many senior officers and encouraged others to retire. Shoup later wrote he felt the Joint Chiefs of Staff had an undue weight in the direction of <b>military</b> <b>strategy.</b> He also sought to curtail politicking by lower-level Marine officers seeking career advancement.|$|E

5|$|Following a new <b>military</b> <b>strategy</b> of the United States {{endorsed}} by Bill Clinton since February 1993, the Washington Agreement {{was signed by}} Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina in March 1994. The agreement ended the Croat–Bosniak War and established the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The political settlement allowed the ARBiH and the HVO to deploy additional troops against the VRS {{in a series of}} small-scale attacks designed to wear down the Bosnian Serb military, but the attacks claimed no territorial gains before October. The ARBiH adopted an attrition warfare strategy relying on its numerical superiority compared to the VRS, which suffered from manpower shortages. This strategy aimed for limited advances, without support of heavy weapons and means of transportunavailable to the ARBiH at the time.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Navy fell apart, without sufficient personnel to man many of its ships or the money to maintain them—indeed, many of them were sold to foreign nations. This left the United States as the world's undisputed naval superpower. U.S. naval forces did undergo a decline in absolute terms but relative {{to the rest of the}} world, however, United States dwarfs other nations' naval power as evinced by its 11 aircraft supercarriers and their supporting battle groups. During the 1990s, the United States naval strategy was based on the overall <b>military</b> <b>strategy</b> of the United States which emphasized the ability of the United States to engage in two simultaneous limited wars along separate fronts.|$|E
5|$|Hansell lectured on {{the theory}} of {{precision}} air attack throughout his life, particularly at the United States Air Force Academy and the Air War College. He authored three books on air strategy: The Air War Plan That Defeated Hitler (1972), The Strategic Air War Against Japan (1980), and Strategic Air War Against Germany and Japan: A Memoir (1986). Hansell continued to study modern weapons systems, becoming an advocate of the Strategic Defense Initiative and the B-2 Spirit bomber. However his main focus was in promoting technical advances in precision guided weapons to make precision bombing more practical and therefore more desirable as a <b>military</b> <b>strategy.</b>|$|E
