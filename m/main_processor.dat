25|$|The spacecraft's onboard {{computer}} system was contained in an Integrated Electronics Module (IEM), {{a device that}} combined core avionics into a single box. The computer featured two radiation-hardened IBM RAD6000s, a 25megahertz <b>main</b> <b>processor,</b> and a 10MHz fault protection processor. For redundancy, the spacecraft carried a pair of identical IEMs. For data storage, the spacecraft carried two solid-state recorders able to store up to one gigabyte each.

25|$|The console has custom {{components}} codeveloped by the Nintendo Research & Engineering Department {{and other}} manufacturers, all combined into a unified system on chip. The <b>main</b> <b>processor</b> (CPU) is a ARM11 MPCore-based dual-core processor manufactured at 45nm. One processor core {{is dedicated to}} games and applications, while the other core is exclusive to the operating system, enabling multitasking and background tasks. These tasks are handled seamlessly in the background during gameplay or while the system is in sleep mode. The system also contains a single-core ARM9 processor, enabling backward compatibility with Nintendo DS games. The graphics processor (GPU) is developed by Digital Media Professionals, and consists of a semi-custom PICA200 processor.|$|E
25|$|The first {{computer}} keyboards were for mainframe computer data terminals and used discrete electronic parts. The first keyboard microprocessor {{was introduced in}} 1972 by General Instruments, but keyboards have been using the single-chip 8048 microcontroller variant since it became available in 1978. The keyboard switch matrix is wired to its inputs, it converts the keystrokes to key codes, and, for a detached keyboard, sends the codes down a serial cable (the keyboard cord) to the <b>main</b> <b>processor</b> on the computer motherboard. This serial keyboard cable communication is only bi-directional {{to the extent that}} the computer's electronics controls the illumination of the caps lock, num lock and scroll lock lights.|$|E
40|$|NICAM is a {{communication}} layer for SMP PC clusters connected via Myrinet, {{designed to reduce}} overhead and latency by directly utilizing a micro-processor equipped on the network interface. It adopts remote memory operations to reduce much of the overhead found in message passing. NICAM employs an Active Messages framework for flexibility in programming on the network interface, and this flexibility will compensate for the large latency resulting from the relatively slow micro-processor. Running message handlers directly on the network interface reduces the overhead by freeing the <b>main</b> <b>processors</b> {{from the work of}} polling incoming messages. The handlers also make synchronizations faster by avoiding the costly interactions between the <b>main</b> <b>processors</b> and the network interface. In addition, this implementation can completely hide latency of barriers in data-parallel programs, because handlers running in the background of the <b>main</b> <b>processors</b> allow reposition of barriers to any place where [...] ...|$|R
50|$|This {{reduction}} in processor requirements {{comes at the}} expense of liveness; if too many <b>main</b> <b>processors</b> fail in a short time, the system must halt until the auxiliary processors can reconfigure the system.

50|$|Later IBM {{allowed a}} single support {{processor}} to control multiple <b>main</b> <b>processors</b> and added support for Local ASP (LASP), {{in which the}} same processor serves as both a local and a main.

25|$|In February 2015, a {{switched-mode}} {{power supply}} chip, designated U16, of the Raspberry Pi2 ModelB version1.1 (the initially released version) {{was found to be}} vulnerable to flashes of light, particularly the light from xenon camera flashes and green and red laser pointers. However, other bright lights, particularly ones that are on continuously, were found to have no effect. The symptom was the Raspberry Pi2 spontaneously rebooting or turning off when these lights were flashed at the chip. Initially, some users and commenters suspected that the electromagnetic pulse (EMP) from the xenon flash tube was causing the problem by interfering with the computer's digital circuitry, but this was ruled out by tests where the light was either blocked by a card or aimed at {{the other side of the}} Raspberry Pi2, both of which did not cause a problem. The problem was narrowed down to the U16 chip by covering first the system on a chip (<b>main</b> <b>processor)</b> and then U16 with Blu-Tack (an opaque poster mounting compound). Light being the sole culprit, instead of EMP, was further confirmed by the laser pointer tests, where it was also found that less opaque covering was needed to shield against the laser pointers than to shield against the xenon flashes. The U16 chip seems to be bare silicon without a plastic cover (i.e. a chip-scale package or wafer-level package), which would, if present, block the light. Unofficial workarounds include covering U16 with opaque material (such as electrical tape, lacquer, poster mounting compound, or even balled-up bread), putting the Raspberry Pi2 in a case, and avoiding taking photos of the top side of the board with a xenon flash. This issue was not caught before the release of the Raspberry Pi2 because while commercial electronic devices are routinely subjected to tests of susceptibility to radio interference, it is not standard or common practice to test their susceptibility to optical interference.|$|E
500|$|The iPhone 5S {{is powered}} by the Apple A7 system-on-chip, the first 64-bit {{processor}} ever used on a smartphone. The device's operating system and pre-loaded software were optimized to run in 64-bit mode, promising increased performance, although third-party app developers would need to optimize their apps {{to take advantage of}} these enhanced capabilities. The A7 processor is designed by Apple and manufactured by Samsung. The A7 processor is accompanied by a new M7 [...] "motion co-processor", a dedicated processor for processing motion data from the iPhone's accelerometer and gyroscopes without requiring the attention of the <b>main</b> <b>processor,</b> which integrates with iOS 7's new CoreMotion APIs. The same A7 SoC and M7 motion co-processor are also found in the iPad Air and iPad Mini 2 which were released in the same quarter as the iPhone 5S.|$|E
50|$|As {{initially}} defined an ASP system {{consisted of}} a large System/360 computer, a Model 50, 65, or 75 running OS/360, called the <b>main</b> <b>processor,</b> and a smaller System/360, Model 40 or larger, called the support processor, running the ASP supervisor as a single task under OS/360 PCP (Primary Control Program). The support processor performed functions such as printing, card reading and punching, freeing the <b>main</b> <b>processor</b> to run the application workload. It queued jobs, roughly 30 in the basic configuration, and released them to the <b>main</b> <b>processor</b> in priority order, and also did pre-execution setup of removable input/output devices such as disks and tapes on the <b>main</b> <b>processor.</b>|$|E

50|$|One of the {{engineering}} challenges with large SMP server designs is to maintain near-linear scalability {{as the number of}} CPUs increases. Performance and throughput do not double when doubling the number of processors. There are many overhead factors, including contention for cache and main memory access. These overhead factors become increasingly difficult to mitigate as the number of CPUs increases. The design goal for delivering maximum performance is to minimize those overhead factors. Each new mainframe model supports a higher maximum number of CPUs (up to 64 <b>main</b> <b>processors</b> in a single System z10 mainframe for example), so this engineering challenge becomes ever more important.|$|R

Untreated and often diluted milk is sold by vendors directly to consumers at about MK 50 per litre. Consumers are paying in supermarkets between MK 70 to 100 per litre for pasteurised milk.|$|R
50|$|Most calculators capable {{to being}} {{connected}} to a computer can be programmed in assembly language and machine code, although on some calculators this is only possible through using exploits.

Some manufacturers do not document and even mildly discourage the assembly language programming of their machines because they must be programmed in this way by putting together the program on the PC and then forcing it into the calculator by various improvised methods.|$|R
