40|$|Due to {{progress}} in fisheries capitalization, boat fisheries had been realized through motorization {{in order to}} expand their fishing towards offshore, while in the coastal fishings, set net fisheries had improved with changes in the shape given to these art and the materials used. In case of yellowtail set net fisheries, such changes have evolved through four steps as follows: 1) The traditional yellowtail catching methods were fixed gill net and triangular set net made of rice straw. But a unique type so-called "yellowtail drift gill net" was used in Miyazaki Prefecture. This was invented by Kiemon Hidaka and his son Kameichi Hidaka in 1875. 2) In 1892, the triangular set net made of hemp was invented by Kameichi Hidaka and his son Eizaburo Hidaka. This has been found effective and has been adopted in big-scale catch consequently contributing much to high productivity. 3) In 1910, the same persons introduced {{for the first time}} the square set net made of hemp. Traditionally, it was made of rice straw used only for capture of tuna. With this new modification, it was possible to catch not only yellowtail but also tuna and was made popular throughout Japan. 4) In 1919, Terushige Horinouchi in Kochi Prefecture introduced the trap set net. This method, although effective, expanded slowly because the trap caught not only yellowtail, a prefered specie, but the <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>fish</b> caught in a big quantity. However, during the gained popularity especially with low-income fishermen due to its low cost and more stable capture compared to square set net method (3). The innovations have progressively contributed to high production on the national level. However in Miyazaki Prefecture as well as in the other places, fluctuations in catch had been experienced every now and then with peaks observed more or less every ten years. Such fluctuations in catch depend upon enviromental conditions such as natural cycles in water current and other man-made factors such as overfishing brought about by new innovation in fishing gears. Before these new innovations were introduced, no problem existed regarding utilization of fishing grounds especially in undevelopment areas. This was due to the fact that only moving fishing gears were commonly utilized. When a shift from moving fishing gears to fixed gill net and eventually to set net occurred, several problems arose mainly; a) Claims on fishing ground areas which was of common use for all. b) Manpower, the set net methods require a number of people in the community for the operation. Due to the existence of such problems, it was necessary to create regulations for proper utilization of fishing grounds. In 1901, the "Meiji" Fisheries Law was established for the first time defining fishing rights were necessary to use the fishing ground. In 1910 and in 1933 at the hight of the "Showa" economic crisis, the law was revised in order to motivate establishment of fisheries co-operative for the benefit of all. As a result, the set net fishing right were given more to these co-operatives allowing them to engage in bisiness, nevertheless the fisheries law didn't discribe any precedence of its ownership and management...|$|E
