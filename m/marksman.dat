5|$|Fleming portrayed Bond as a tall, athletic, {{handsome}} {{secret agent}} {{in his thirties}} or forties; he has several vices including drinking, smoking, gambling, automobiles and womanizing. He is an exceptional <b>marksman,</b> and skilled in unarmed combat, skiing, swimming and golf. While Bond kills without hesitation or regret, he usually kills only when carrying out orders, while acting in self-defence and occasionally as revenge.|$|E
5|$|After {{rest and}} recovery, the {{regiment}} {{moved to the}} Fromelles sector of the front in mid-October. Here Kippenberger volunteered for sniper duty despite not being known for his accuracy as a <b>marksman.</b> He served in this capacity until he was badly wounded in the arm by shrapnel on 10 November 1916. Although he eventually recovered from his wound, {{at the time it}} was serious enough that he was repatriated to New Zealand and discharged from the NZEF in April 1917.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Hans-Joachim Marseille, {{who was a}} <b>marksman</b> {{and expert}} {{in the art of}} {{deflection}} shooting, Hartmann was a master of stalk-and-ambush tactics. By his own account, he was convinced that 80% of the pilots he downed did not even realise what hit them. He relied on the powerful engine of his Bf109 for high-power sweeps and quick approaches, occasionally diving through entire enemy formations {{to take advantage of the}} confusion that followed in order to disengage.|$|E

50|$|The Fall River <b>Marksmen</b> {{finished}} top of {{the table}} in both {{the first and second}} half. The league saw no need for a playoff and declared the <b>Marksmen</b> champions. The <b>Marksmen</b> also won the league (Lewis) cup and the 1929-30 National Challenge Cup, giving it a treble. Having achieved this distinction, the <b>Marksmen</b> promptly withdrew from the league and merged with the New York Soccer Club to form the New York Yankees for the 1931 season.|$|R

5|$|Upon {{completing}} training McKellar {{was deemed}} to have exceptional eyesight which {{earned him a}} reputation as a good <b>marksman</b> in air-to-air combat. Yet, paradoxically, when shooting with his rifle he was a well below average shot – a trait he shared with some other successful pilots. MacKellar was a keen sportsman. He believed physical fitness was a critical attribute in aerial combat; fitness, he believed, would ensure that the mind and body were always at their peak of alertness, and enable a pilot to react swiftly within a fluid battle situation.|$|E
5|$|A 15-year-old elephant, Ellie May, had {{acquired}} an undeserved {{reputation for being}} dangerous, which made her extremely difficult to sell. Her food costs became difficult to justify, but Grayson refused to have her put down. Although he left the zoo in January 1978, Grayson returned frequently to care for Ellie May, the last animal left at the zoo. Eventually Rotterdam Zoo agreed to take her, and plans were made to transport the elephant to the Netherlands. Ellie May refused to budge however, and overnight developed pneumonia and heart failure. Grayson and veterinary surgeon, David Taylor, felt {{that she would not}} recover, and decided to call in a <b>marksman</b> to euthanise her.|$|E
5|$|Assigned to the infantry, during basic {{training}} at Camp Wolters, Texas, Murphy earned the <b>Marksman</b> Badge with Rifle Clasp and the Expert Badge with Bayonet Clasp. While {{participating in a}} close-order drill during that hot Texas summer, he passed out. His company commander thought his build was too slight for service in the infantry, and tried to have him transferred to a cook and bakers' school, but Murphy insisted on becoming a combat soldier. He completed the 13-week {{basic training}} course and in October was given leave to visit his family, after which {{he was sent to}} Fort George G. Meade in Maryland for advanced infantry training until January 1943.|$|E
5000|$|Schützenfests may {{range from}} one day to several days and may include and be {{accompanied}} by various events. They often take place in the festival room of a local public house or in a pavilion especially erected for the occasion. In the Sauerland, many towns have a special Marksmen's Hall that is used for these festivities. Many Schützenfests start with a festive procession, whereby the reigning King of <b>Marksmen,</b> along with the royal household, plus local dignitaries, are all escorted by the <b>marksmen</b> and paraded to the festive square or the festivities. This is often followed by a [...] "royal parade" [...] where the <b>marksmen</b> march past the king and the royal court, with marching bands, Corps of Drums and fanfare bands playing along. (Goose steps are commonly done by the <b>marksmen</b> in the parade, especially in old towns and cities, but in other places it is not done, however, as the <b>marksmen</b> march in the same pace as the Bundeswehr do today.) The parading <b>marksmen</b> are formed in platoons or squads {{depending on the size of}} the formation, and in large towns and cities <b>marksmen</b> are formed in companies and in both cases of the parade color guards march along with them. In a lot of cases, the pavilion is surrounded by a funfair.|$|R
50|$|The 1920s {{and early}} 1930s are {{sometimes}} {{described as the}} Golden Era of U.S. soccer {{and it was the}} Fall River <b>Marksmen</b> that emerged as the era's dominant team. During the 1923-24 season the <b>Marksmen</b> completely dominated the league. They eventually won their first league title, finishing 6 points clear of Bethlehem Steel. Harold Brittan again spearheaded the offense, scoring 15 goals. However the strength of the team lay in a strong defense which included Ned Tate and Findlay Kerr, who kept an incredible 14 clean sheets during the league season. The season also saw the <b>Marksmen</b> go on to complete the first ASL / National Challenge Cup double. In the semi-final of the Challenge Cup, the <b>Marksmen</b> defeated Steel 2-0 at Dexter Park in front of 20,000 fans. On March 20, 1924 the final attracted 14,000 fans to the High School Field in St. Louis, Missouri where they witnessed the <b>Marksmen</b> defeat St. Louis Vesper Buick 4-2. The only disappointment for the <b>Marksmen</b> during the season came when they lost 1-0 to Steel in the final of the American Cup.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of his {{exploits}} with Walsh Chevrolet, Reder signed with the Fall River <b>Marksmen</b> in 1929. Together with a team that included Billy Gonsalves, Bert Patenaude, Werner Nilsen and Alex McNab, Reder helped the <b>Marksmen</b> win American Soccer League titles in both the spring and fall seasons. He also helped them win the National Challenge Cup in both 1930 and 1931 In the 1930 final, the <b>Marksmen</b> defeated Cleveland Bruell Insurance 9-3 on aggregate in a two-leg final and Reder kept goal in both games. On May 30, 1930 he also played for the <b>Marksmen</b> in a 3-2 defeat against a touring Rangers.|$|R
5|$|Eventually, Charles {{apparently}} conquered {{his physical}} infirmity, {{which might have}} been caused by rickets. He became an adept horseman and <b>marksman,</b> and took up fencing. Even so, his public profile remained low in contrast to that of his physically stronger and taller elder brother, Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, whom Charles adored and attempted to emulate. However, in early November 1612, Henry {{died at the age of}} 18 of what is suspected to have been typhoid (or possibly porphyria). Charles, who turned 12 two weeks later, became heir apparent. As the eldest surviving son of the sovereign, Charles automatically gained several titles (including Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay). Four years later, in November 1616, he was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester.|$|E
5|$|McCroon {{breaks into}} Craven's house intent on killing him. Craven demands McCroon tell him {{who he is}} working for but McCroon is shot by a police <b>marksman</b> before he can say anything. Through a contact of Mac (Struan Roger), a {{colleague}} from his time in Northern Ireland, Craven gains access to a terminal connected to the MI5 computer. He checks the MI5 records for GAIA, Northmoor and Emma and learns that McCroon was acting on the orders of Northmoor Security. He also obtains a three-dimensional map of Northmoor from the computer. Craven contacts Jedburgh and asks him to accompany him inside Northmoor.|$|E

50|$|Between 1925 and 1931, White made 243 league {{appearances}} and scored 111 {{goals for the}} <b>Marksmen</b> in the American Soccer League, helping them win five league titles. He also helped them win the National Challenge Cup three times, scoring twice goals in the 1927 final against Holley Carburetor F.C..

50|$|In January 1924 McEachran {{signed with}} Vale of Leven F.C. in the Scottish Football League. In July 1924, he {{transferred}} to Clydebank in the Scottish Football League. In 1926, he moved to Preston North End of The Football League, playing only one league game on 2 April 1924. That summer, he left Britain to sign with the Fall River <b>Marksmen</b> in the American Soccer League. In May 1927, the <b>Marksmen</b> crushed Holley Carburetor F.C. in the 1927 National Challenge Cup final. McEachran scored two of the <b>Marksmen</b> goals in their 7-0 victory. He began the 1927-1928 season with the <b>Marksmen</b> before transferring to the Boston Soccer Club {{at the end of}} the season.|$|R
25|$|The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, {{the sport}} club that plays {{host to the}} Championships, came under fire from animal activists for using <b>marksmen</b> to shoot down dive-bombing pigeons. The <b>marksmen</b> were ordered to use hawks to scare them away, but when some failed to do so, the <b>marksmen</b> killed them, {{which led to the}} People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) group {{releasing}} a statement admonishing the practice and subsequently, referring to the Animal Welfare Act 2006, contacting the Metropolitan Police.|$|R
5|$|Arsène Lupin III, the {{grandson}} of the fictional gentleman thief, Arsène Lupin, is considered the world's greatest thief, known for announcing his intentions to steal valuable objects by sending a calling card to the owners of his desired items. His right-hand man and closest ally is Daisuke Jigen, an expert <b>marksman</b> who can accurately shoot a target in 0.3 seconds. Although Lupin and Jigen frequently work as a two-man team, they are often joined by Goemon Ishikawa XIII, a master swordsman whose sword can cut anything, or Fujiko Mine, a femme fatale and Lupin's love interest. Although Fujiko usually works together with the others, she occasionally exploits Lupin's interest in her to steal the treasure for herself. Lupin and his gang are constantly chased by Inspector Koichi Zenigata of the ICPO, who has made it his life's work to arrest them, pursuing Lupin across the globe.|$|E
5|$|Black {{comes to}} in a {{hospital}} bed, tended to by his wife Catherine Black (Megan Gallagher). She explains to him what has happened, and turns {{on the evening news}} to show him the interview with his rescuer. However, watching Dees speak, Black quickly realises he is the bomber. The FBI locate Dees' home, but his electronic surveillance had alerted him long before, and he has escaped before they even arrive. However, as Black sits in his car, he receives a call from Dees, who has booby-trapped the car. The FBI are able to monitor this call with Dees' equipment. Dees tells Black that they will both soon be famous, letting Black know that he has a remote detonator for the car's explosives. Before he can use it, he is killed by a police <b>marksman.</b>|$|E
5|$|He {{had been}} hit by a <b>marksman</b> from the Redoutable, firing at a range of 50feet (15m). The bullet had entered his left shoulder, passed through his spine at the sixth and seventh {{thoracic}} vertebrae, and lodged two inches (5cm) below his right shoulder blade in the muscles of his back. Nelson was carried below by sergeant-major of marines Robert Adair and two seamen. As he was being carried down, he asked them to pause while he gave some advice to a midshipman on the handling of the tiller. He then draped a handkerchief over his face to avoid causing alarm amongst the crew. He was taken to the surgeon William Beatty, telling him You can do nothing for me. I have but a short time to live. My back is shot through. Nelson was made comfortable, fanned and brought lemonade and watered wine to drink after he complained of feeling hot and thirsty. He asked several times to see Hardy, who was on deck supervising the battle, and asked Beatty to remember him to Emma, his daughter and his friends.|$|E
5000|$|In the Spring of 1927, Brittan {{decided to}} return to the field, this time back with the Fall River <b>Marksmen.</b> While the <b>Marksmen</b> {{finished}} third in the league, they won the 1927 National Challenge Cup, defeating Detroit Holley Carburetor F.C. by a score of 7-0. Brittan scored one goal in that victory.http://www.sover.net/~spectrum/year/1927.html [...] Brittan then played one last complete season with the <b>Marksmen,</b> scoring 16 goals in 28 games, giving him his team record 135 goals in 168 league games during two stints in Fall River.|$|R

5|$|Pattle joined No. 80 Squadron RAF. The {{squadron}} was in {{the midst}} of re-forming at RAF Kenley and he was able to fly the Gloster Gladiator fighter for the first time in May 1937. In June, the unit moved to RAF Debden. Here, they practised aerial combat against RAF Bomber Command squadrons which staged mock raids against London. During these exercises, he mastered deflection shooting. Pattle developed his own air tactics. He preferred attacking at higher altitudes than his quarry, meeting head-on, then waiting for the enemy to fly by before rolling over and diving to attack from the side and rear of the enemy. He usually held his fire until very close to the target to make sure of hitting his opponent. His qualities as an officer led to him being promoted to squadron adjutant. A gifted flyer and natural <b>marksman,</b> he took pains to improve both talents, doing exercises to improve his distance vision and sharpen his reflexes. He progressed in rank with the squadron and was duly promoted to pilot officer on 27 July 1937.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{returned}} to Germany {{after the operation}} was complete. Throughout 1998–2002 it would train with German engineers, including German units from Lahnstein and Speyer, {{as well as the}} German Engineering School. The brigade also set up <b>marksman</b> competitions with German units, to give US soldiers the chance to earn the German Armed Forces Badge of Marksmanship, the German Sports Badge, and other badges. Over 2,500 of these badges would be earned by soldiers of the 130th over the years that it served in Germany. It also trained extensively in bridging operations at rivers throughout Germany. In summer of 2000, the brigade participated in a joint engineering exercise in Moldova with US Navy Seabees and the 505th Engineer Brigade of the North Carolina Army National Guard. The exercise was the first ever conducted in Moldova and featured numerous training scenarios as well as the construction of a medical clinic. Several other such exercises were conducted in nations throughout Europe including Albania, Romania, Georgia, Latvia, Bulgaria and Macedonia. They also performed annual humanitarian missions to Poland, working on community projects around the country with the assistance of Polish Armed Forces every September, as a training exercise.|$|E

50|$|These {{features}} and unusual characteristics were {{driven by the}} tactical use doctrine of Dragunov armed <b>marksmen,</b> which was: from (just behind) the first line targeting high-value targets of opportunity and providing special long-distance disrupting and suppressive fire on the battlefield, even with sudden close encounters with enemy troops in mind. A {{relatively small number of}} <b>marksmen</b> could assist conventional troops by combating or harassing valuable targets and assets such as: key enemy personnel like officers, non-commissioned officers and radio operators, exposed tank commanders, designated <b>marksmen</b> and snipers, machinegun teams, anti-tank warfare teams, etc.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{difference}} between military <b>marksmen</b> and snipers is that <b>marksmen</b> are usually considered an organic {{part of a}} fireteam of soldiers and are never expected to operate independently, whereas snipers usually work alone or in very small teams. Snipers are also often tasked with responsibilities other than delivering long-range fire—specifically, conducting reconnaissance and directing artillery or air strikes. Within the military, <b>marksmen</b> are sometimes attached to an infantry fireteam or squad where they take accurate long-range shots at valuable targets as needed, thus extending {{the reach of the}} fireteam or squad.|$|R
50|$|The Dragunov is an {{original}} rifle design for several reasons. First, {{it was not}} meant for highly trained and specialized sniper teams, but rather for designated <b>marksmen.</b> After {{the introduction of the}} SVD, the Soviet Army deployed designated <b>marksmen</b> at the basic motorized infantry rifle platoon level. Those designated <b>marksmen</b> were often chosen from personnel who did well in terms of rifle marksmanship while members of DOSAAF. Such <b>marksmen</b> were estimated to have a 50% probability of hitting a standing, man-sized target at 800 m, and an 80% probability of hitting a standing, man-sized target at 500 m. For distances not exceeding 200 m the probability was estimated to be well above 90%. To attain this level of accuracy the sniper could not engage more than two such targets per minute.|$|R
