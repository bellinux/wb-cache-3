25|$|Acidity {{is highest}} in wine grapes {{just before the}} start of veraison, which ushers in the {{ripening}} period of the annual cycle of grape vines. As the grapes ripen, their sugar levels increase and their acidity levels decrease. Through the process of respiration, malic acid is metabolized by the grape vine. Grapes from cooler climate wine regions generally have higher levels of acidity due to the slower ripening process. The level of acidity still present in the grape is an important consideration for winemakers in deciding when to begin harvest. For wines such as Champagne and other sparkling wines, having high levels of acidity is even <b>more</b> <b>vital</b> to the winemaking process, so grapes are often picked under-ripe and at higher acid levels.|$|E

It is also used, when applicable, to get very close to the opponent and then to control the opponent's arms or hands.

25|$|New Horizons {{crossed the}} orbit of Saturn on June 8, 2008, and Uranus on March 18, 2011. After astronomers {{announced}} the discovery of two new moons in the Pluto system, Kerberos and Styx, mission planners started contemplating {{the possibility of the}} probe running into unseen debris and dust left over from ancient collisions between the moons. A study based on 18 months of computer simulations, Earth-based telescope observations and occultations of the Pluto system revealed that the possibility of a catastrophic collision with debris or dust was less than 0.3% on the probe's scheduled course. If the hazard increased, New Horizons could have used one of two possible contingency plans, the so-called SHBOTs (Safe Haven by Other Trajectories): the probe could have continued on its present trajectory with the antenna facing the incoming particles so the <b>more</b> <b>vital</b> systems would be protected, or, it could have positioned its antenna to make a course correction that would take it just 3000km from the surface of Pluto where it was expected that the atmospheric drag would clean the surrounding space of possible debris.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} batting in {{partnership}} becomes even <b>more</b> <b>vital</b> once only one recognised quality batsman remains. His job is then to shepherd the tail-end batsmen, {{while attempting to}} eke out as many runs as possible, or simply to survive {{as long as possible}} when merely attempting to save the game. This usually involves attempting to minimise risk, by exposing the lesser batsmen to as little bowling as possible. To do this, boundaries and twos are preferred while singles are avoided in the early parts of an over (although this allows the fielding captain to set his field further back into a more defensive position, often tempting the batsman with an easy single) but because the bowling end changes {{at the end of an}} over, it is necessary to score a single (or much more rarely, three runs) to counteract this. While a single on the sixth and final ball of the over would be ideal, the field is usually set closer to make this harder and the batsman may prefer to rotate the strike on the fifth or even fourth ball, hoping that the tail-ender can survive for a delivery or two, rather than risking either having to take a dangerous run on the last ball (with the attendant risk of a run out) or not being able to get a single at all, leaving the tail-ender stranded on strike for the start of the next over (hence allowing up to six balls to be bowled at him).|$|E
500|$|Further {{recognition}} of his work came when Negus was made Hunterian Professor at the Royal College of Surgeons in 1925, followed three years later in 1928 by the awarding of the triennial John Hunter Medal (1925–7) from the Royal College of Surgeons, which came with a prize of £50. The following year Negus published his observations and conclusions in The Mechanism of the Larynx (1929), a [...] "classic piece of research" [...] still referred to forty-five years later in 1974 as [...] "the standard reference book" [...] on this topic. Negus's work had shown that the main function of the larynx is as a valve that only allows air into the lower respiratory tract. In humans, the voice is only a byproduct of this <b>more</b> <b>vital</b> function. Another lecture resulting from this work was given {{under the auspices of}} the University of London's Semon Lectureship, named after the German-born British laryngologist Felix Semon (1849–1921).

500|$|Carmen herself, says Dean, is a {{new type}} of operatic heroine {{representing}} a new kind of love, not the innocent kind associated with the [...] "spotless soprano" [...] school, but something altogether <b>more</b> <b>vital</b> and dangerous. Her capriciousness, fearlessness and love of freedom are all musically represented: [...] "She is redeemed from any suspicion of vulgarity by her qualities of courage and fatalism so vividly realised in the music". Curtiss suggests that Carmen's character, spiritually and musically, may be a realisation of the composer's own unconscious longing for a freedom denied to him by his stifling marriage. Harold C. Schonberg likens Carmen to [...] "a female Don Giovanni. She would rather die than be false to herself". The dramatic personality of the character, and the range of moods she is required to express, call for exceptional acting and singing talents. This has deterred some of opera's most distinguished exponents; Maria Callas, though she recorded the part, never performed it on stage. The musicologist Hugh Macdonald observes that [...] "French opera never produced another femme as fatale as Carmen", though she may have influenced some of Massenet's heroines. Macdonald suggests that outside the French repertoire, Richard Strauss's Salome and Alban Berg's Lulu [...] "may be seen as distant degenerate descendants of Bizet's temptress".|$|E

[...] Winwood also reviewed the album favourably for BBC Music, comparing its lyrics to The King Blues' Punk & Poetry and calling Enter Shikari [...] "the only other mainstream-breaching British rock band concerning itself with the news of the world". Johnny Firecloud gave the album an eight-out-of-ten rating on CraveOnline: [...] "Enter Shikari have found a balance while honing a voice of rebellion – at a time where tearing down boundaries and microanalyzing the current structure is <b>more</b> <b>vital</b> and valuable than ever before in our lives."

In NME, Dan Martin gave the album an eight-out-of-ten rating: [...] "All of that surface tension lands Enter Shikari in a pretty powerful position for their third – and, as the title promises fabulously, they respond to the challenge in explosive style to deliver something like their defining statement." [...] Rocksound writer Ryan Bird gave the album a nine-out-of-ten score, praising the band for their emotional cultural and sonic development and noting the importance of their message: [...] "In a world edging ever closer to complete and utter destruction, Enter Shikari remain fearless and uncompromising leaders in a field of one." ...|$|E
