5|$|A Link Between Worlds {{features}} original music {{along with}} tracks from A Link to the Past. Ryo Nagamatsu composed and orchestrated new music for A Link Between Worlds, {{and played the}} flute music featured in the game's milk bar. He also composed arrangements and adapted Koji Kondo's original music from A Link to the Past. Nagamatsu wanted to balance arrangements of past music with completely new music to please both old and new players. He began by revisiting old tracks and thinking how he could best adapt them for A Link Between Worlds soundtrack. He was eager to include choral performances {{as a way to}} add tension to the eerie and unpleasant scenes in the game. Nagamatsu performed the vocals and made use of <b>multitrack</b> <b>recording</b> to layer the different vocals tracks. The audio team decided not use a live orchestra for recording the game's music, the primary reason for this was to create optimal sound for the Nintendo 3DS. The reverberations and low-pitch sounds created by a live orchestra were not suitable for the Nintendo 3DS speakers. The majority of the string music was created using a synthesizer, with Toru Minegishi playing guitar on one track.|$|E

The sounds {{at the beginning of}} the song are those of Page warming up his electric guitar. He called it [...] "waking up the army of guitars" [...] - which are <b>multitrack</b> <b>recorded</b> in unison with electric bass guitar to provide the song's signature. Towards the end of the song, Page incorporates parallel thirds into the riff. Plant's vocals were recorded in two takes.|$|R

25|$|Crosby had {{launched}} {{the tape recorder}} revolution in America. In his 1950 film Mr. Music, Crosby is seen singing {{into one of the}} new Ampex tape recorders that reproduced his voice better than anything else. Also quick to adopt tape recording was his friend Bob Hope. He gave one of the first Ampex Model 300 recorders to his friend, musician Les Paul, which led directly to Paul's invention of <b>multitrack</b> <b>recording.</b> His organization, the Crosby Research Foundation, also held various tape recording patents and developed equipment and recording techniques such as the laugh track that are still in use today.|$|E
25|$|Lester William Polsfuss (June 9, 1915 – August 12, 2009), {{known as}} Les Paul, was an American jazz, country, and blues guitarist, songwriter, luthier, and inventor. He {{was one of}} the pioneers of the solid-body {{electric}} guitar. Paul taught himself how to play guitar, and while he is mainly known for jazz and popular music, he had an early career in country music. He is credited with many recording innovations. Although he was not the first to use the technique, his early experiments with overdubbing (also known as sound on sound), delay effects such as tape delay, phasing effects and <b>multitrack</b> <b>recording</b> {{were among the first to}} attract widespread attention.|$|E

500|$|During the {{composition}} phase, Harris <b>multitrack</b> <b>recorded</b> the rehearsals, allowing the band {{to listen to}} the material and re-examine it, allowing them greater room to jam while writing [...] "without the worry of forgetting something or not fully understanding what [...] doing". This, coupled with the lack of a deadline, meant that the process was more open-ended for the band, allowing more freedom to abandon failed avenues and giving ideas time to evolve. This attitude was extended to {{the manner in which the}} vocals were tracked – until Wavering Radiant, the vocals had normally been recorded last. Instead, more time was spent recording them; this allowed Aaron Turner, who had steadily grown in confidence as a vocalist, to relax and enjoy the process.|$|R
25|$|Re-amping is {{a process}} often used in <b>multitrack</b> <b>recording</b> in which a {{recorded}} signal is routed {{back out of the}} editing environment and run through external processing using effects units and then into a guitar amplifier and a guitar speaker cabinet or a reverb chamber. Originally, the technique was used mostly for electric guitars: it facilitates a separation of guitar playing from guitar amplifier processing—a previously recorded audio program is played back and re-recorded at a later time for the purpose of adding effects, ambiance such as reverb or echo, and the tone shaping imbued by certain amps and cabinets. The technique has since evolved over the 2000s to include many other applications. Re-amping can also be applied to other instruments and program, such as recorded drums, synthesizers, and virtual instruments.|$|E
500|$|Abbey Road {{was also}} the first and only Beatles album to be entirely {{recorded}} through a solid state transistor mixing desk, the TG12345 Mk I, as opposed to earlier thermionic valve based REDD desks. The TG console also allowed better support for eight-track <b>multitrack</b> <b>recording,</b> helping the Beatles' considerable use of overdubbing. Emerick recalls the TG desk used to record the album had individual limiters and compressors on each audio channel and noted the overall sound was [...] "softer" [...] than the earlier valve desks.|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{recorded}} {{the rest of}} the Indian selections between 9 and 13 January at HMV Studios in Bombay. In contrast to the <b>multitrack</b> <b>recording</b> carried out at Abbey Road, the music was captured on a two-track tape machine designed for mono recording. In the book The Beatles Anthology, Harrison recalls that EMI India's managing director, Bhaskar Menon, personally delivered this machine, which he says was a STEEDS stereo recorder, by train from Calcutta. The Bombay studio's soundproofing was similarly inadequate, resulting in traffic noise from the street below appearing on pieces such as [...] "In the Park".|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a simple and}} practical error control mechanism that allows multiple-errors and multiple-erasures correction for <b>multitrack</b> magnetic <b>recording</b> systems. The proposed mechanism is based on using a simple and fast hash function to locate erroneous tracks in magnetic tape and exploit the MDS property of array codes to correct these tracks as erasures. The mechanism enables MDS array codes with r parity symbols to correct s tracks in error and t erased tracks (s + t ≤ r) with negligible probability of undetected error. The proposed mechanism reduces the redundancy requirement,for a given degree of reliability, by almost 50 % from that needed by conventional systems. It also reduces the encoding and decoding complexity for <b>multitrack</b> magnetic <b>recording</b> channels. 1...|$|R

500|$|Developed during live performances, {{an early}} version was premiered several months before {{recording}} began; new material was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at Abbey Road in London. The group used some advanced recording techniques at the time, including <b>multitrack</b> <b>recording</b> and tape loops. Analogue synthesizers were prominent in several tracks, and snippets from recorded interviews with Pink Floyd's road crew and others provided philosophical quotations throughout. Engineer Alan Parsons was responsible for many distinctively notable sonic aspects and the recruitment of singer Clare Torry. The album's iconic sleeve, designed by Storm Thorgerson, depicts a prism spectrum and represents the band's lighting, the record's thematic material, and keyboardist Richard Wright's [...] "simple and bold" [...] design request.|$|E
500|$|The Experience began {{recording}} [...] "Purple Haze" [...] on January 11, 1967, at De Lane Lea Studios in London. According to drummer Mitch Mitchell, he and bassist Noel Redding {{learned the}} song in the studio: [...] "Hendrix came in and kind of hummed us the riff and showed Noel the chords and the changes. I listened to it and we went, 'OK, let's do it.' We got it on the third take as I recall." [...] The basic track was recorded in four hours, according to Chandler. [...] <b>Multitrack</b> <b>recording</b> technology allowed engineers to record and complete additional parts on the final master. [...] After the basic track was finished, Chandler explained that he and Hendrix developed the song: ...|$|E
500|$|Returning from {{a series}} of tours across America and England in support of Atom Heart Mother, at the start of 1971 Pink Floyd {{commenced}} work on new material at Abbey Road Studios in London. [...] At the time, Abbey Road was equipped only with eight-track <b>multitrack</b> <b>recording</b> facilities, which the band found insufficient for the increasing technical demands of their project. [...] They transferred their best efforts, including the opening of what became [...] "Echoes", to 16-track tape at smaller studios in London (namely AIR, and Morgan in West Hampstead) and resumed work with the advantage of more flexible recording equipment. [...] Engineers John Leckie and Peter Bown recorded the main Abbey Road and AIR sessions, while for minor work at Morgan, [...] Rob Black and Roger Quested handled the engineering duties.|$|E

500|$|Instead {{of using}} <b>multitrack</b> <b>recording</b> (which was quickly gaining popularity), the Allman Brothers Band opted to cut most of Idlewild South live, {{with all of}} the musicians {{performing}} together. On rare occasions, they would go back to overdub sections that weren't up to standard. [...] "The idea is that part of the thing of the Allman Brothers is the spontaneity — the elasticity. The parts and tempos vary in a way that only they are sensitive to", said Dowd. Duane often left a song alone for more work and testing out on the road. [...] "They would record maybe five songs. Then they might say, 'I don't think that song was good enough,' or, 'I don't think that song was ready to record,", remembered Dowd. Joel Dorn, predominantly a jazz producer for Atlantic, stepped in to produce one song on the album, [...] "Please Call Home", which was recorded at Regency Sound Studios on July 14, 1970. The band were in New York at the time and Dowd was unavailable.|$|E

2500|$|Disco {{songs were}} {{arranged}} and composed by experienced arrangers and orchestrators, and record producers added their creative touches {{to the overall}} sound using <b>multitrack</b> <b>recording</b> techniques and effects units. Recording complex arrangements with such {{a large number of}} instruments and sections required a team that included a conductor, copyists, record producers, and mixing engineers. Mixing engineers had {{an important role in the}} disco production process, because disco songs used as many as 64 tracks of vocals and instruments. Mixing engineers and record producers, under the direction of arrangers, compiled these tracks into a fluid composition of verses, bridges, and refrains, complete with orchestral builds and breaks. Mixing engineers and record producers helped to develop the [...] "disco sound" [...] by creating a distinctive-sounding, sophisticated disco mix.|$|E
2500|$|Ethnomusicologist David Toop {{posited that}} the Beach Boys' effect on sound {{pioneering}} could be related with the pioneering of Les Baxter, Aphex Twin, Herbie Hancock, King Tubby, and My Bloody Valentine. In 1997, Sean O'Hagan of the High Llamas named Wilson [...] "the most experimental pop pioneer {{of our time}} ... The same way Sun Ra was utilizing those ideas in the '60s, those guys [...] were actually playing around with pop experimental music". Professor Bill Martin states that the Beach Boys opened a path in rock music [...] "that went from Sgt. Pepper's to Close to the Edge and beyond". He argues that the advancing technology of <b>multitrack</b> <b>recording</b> and mixing boards were more influential to experimental rock than electronic instruments such as the synthesizer, allowing the Beatles and the Beach Boys {{to become the first}} crop of non-classically trained musicians to create extended and complex compositions.|$|E
50|$|Multitracking a song also leaves {{open the}} {{possibilities}} of remixes by the same or future artists, such as DJs. If the song was not available in a <b>multitrack</b> format <b>recording,</b> {{the job of the}} remixing artist could be very difficult, or impossible, because once the tracks have been re-recorded together during the mixdown phase, they are inseparable. Theoretically, one could use frequency selective filters for this, but in reality this has not been done with any great degree of success because of the multi-harmonic (having many frequencies) nature of many musical instruments and voices.|$|R
