5|$|Most of Karen's {{appearances}} {{in the first four}} seasons depict her as a large, blue monitor in the Chum Bucket's laboratory; at other times, only her voice is heard from within Plankton's robotic creations. In The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, a <b>mobile</b> <b>unit</b> is introduced to allow Karen to interact more easily with others. Showrunner Vincent Waller stated that the <b>mobile</b> <b>unit</b> was introduced because having Karen able to move was more convenient for storytelling purposes. Karen alternates between her multiple forms in most episodes produced after the film. As of the tenth season, her wall monitor is no longer used and her mobile form is always equipped with a pair of robotic arms.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War Jacques became a nurse in the VAD; she served in a <b>mobile</b> <b>unit</b> in London, attending bombed sites during the Blitz. After a reorganisation in the VAD, Jacques sought new work and, in the summer of 1943, she became a welder in a factory in north London, a job that lasted {{until the end of the}} year. Around this time she became romantically involved with an American soldier, Major Charles Kearney. Jacques later claimed that the pair had been engaged and that Kearney had been killed in action, although her biographer, Andy Merriman, discovered that Kearney had a wife and children in the United States when he had proposed to Jacques, and had returned to them after the war.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of its bombing, Hiroshima was a city of both {{industrial}} and military significance. A number of military units were located nearby, the most important of which was the headquarters of Field Marshal Shunroku Hata's Second General Army, which commanded the defense of all of southern Japan, and was located in Hiroshima Castle. Hata's command consisted of some 400,000 men, most of whom were on Kyushu where an Allied invasion was correctly anticipated. Also present in Hiroshima were the headquarters of the 59th Army, the 5th Division and the 224th Division, a recently formed <b>mobile</b> <b>unit.</b> The city was defended by five batteries of 7-cm and 8-cm (2.8 and 3.1 inch) anti-aircraft guns of the 3rd Anti-Aircraft Division, including units from the 121st and 122nd Anti-Aircraft Regiments and the 22nd and 45th Separate Anti-Aircraft Battalions. In total, an estimated 40,000 Japanese military personnel were stationed in the city.|$|E

Led by World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee, the A4AI seeks to make Internet access more affordable so that access is broadened in the developing world, where only 31% of people are online. Google will help to decrease Internet access prices so that they fall below the UN Broadband Commission's worldwide target of 5% of monthly income. In line with the maturing PC business, in July 2013, Microsoft announced that it would reorganize the business into four new business divisions by function: Operating System, Apps, Cloud, and Devices. All previous divisions were diluted into new divisions without any workforce cuts.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the brigade}} arrived, {{many of the}} Germans around the drop zone withdrew or offered no further resistance. The first unit on the ground, 10 Para, {{attacked}} and destroyed the Dutch SS Wachbattalion while Brigadier Hackett personally captured ten Germans shortly after landing. When Hackett arrived at brigade headquarters, he was informed by Lieutenant Colonel Mckenzie of the division's staff about the change in plans, explaining that 11 Para was to be detached from his brigade to support the push into Arnhem. At {{the same time the}} KOSB, until then responsible for defending the northern side of the landing grounds, were attached to 4th Parachute Brigade to replace 11 Para. Meanwhile, the KOSB still had to defend landing-zone 'L', to protect gliders arriving on day three. While Hackett formulated a new plan, Mckenzie returned to divisional headquarters, to be informed on his arrival that 60 German tanks were approaching Arnhem from the north. Transport aircraft passing over occupied channel ports had confirmed German suspicions of a second lift such {{that they were able to}} give their troops at Arnhem forty-five minutes advance notice of the allies' arrival. Prepared in advance for such an eventuality, a Waffen SS <b>mobile</b> <b>unit</b> had been dispatched towards the likely landing grounds.|$|E

25|$|It {{was thought}} that commanders {{might be tempted to}} think of the Armadillo as a mobile pillbox rather than any sort of tank or {{armoured}} car. To counter such a view, instructions emphasised its use as a <b>mobile</b> <b>unit,</b> not a static fort and it was to be reserved for the defence of the airfield and not given other tasks such as transporting ammunition or being driven off to find parachutists.|$|E
25|$|Without {{an extra}} global {{navigation}} satellite system, receiver tracking is difficult, but not impossible, as {{the position of}} a <b>mobile</b> <b>unit</b> can be determined using a Doppler shift calculation from the satellite.

Even without using Doppler shifts, a rough indication of a unit's position can be found by checking the location of the spot-beam being used and the mobile unit's timing advance.|$|E
