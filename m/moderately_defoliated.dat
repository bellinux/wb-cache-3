40|$|An {{analysis}} of Landsat imagery of forested areas near Williamsport, Pennsylvania {{shows that the}} effects of defoliation by insects can be assessed over a two month period beginning in early June. Within this window heavily defoliated forest can be successfully delineated from <b>moderately</b> <b>defoliated</b> and healthy forest. Consequently, the effects of insect damage can be assessed at times other than peak defoliation, doubling the probability that useful satellite data can be acquired in the Williamsport area...|$|E
30|$|To {{assess the}} effect of {{defoliation}} on tree growth and mortality, 18 plots were established in April 2014. Six rectangular plots, each comprised of 30 trees, were established in severely defoliated stands, three in <b>moderately</b> <b>defoliated</b> stands and nine in non-defoliated stands. Diameter at breast height and total tree height was measured for each tree {{at the time of}} the plot establishment and again in October 2014. Additional variables were also recorded for each tree, e.g. if they were alive or dead, their defoliation class, and the number of egg masses on the stem.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we provide}} {{preliminary}} {{estimates of the}} impacts of the hemlock woolly adelgid on residential property values in Sparta, New Jersey, using the hedonic property value method. The literature on the aesthetic perceptions of forest landscapes is briefly reviewed to provide guidance in formulating economic hypotheses {{based on the assumption}} of an informative relationship between forest aesthetics and economic value. The hedonic property value literature regarding the ornamental and landscape value of trees is also reviewed. The empirical results show that healthy and lightly defoliated hemlocks contribute positive value to residential properties, and that <b>moderately</b> <b>defoliated</b> hemlocks reduce property values. Value ‘spillovers’, or externalities, are also observed where hemlock health has an impact not only on individual parcels containing hemlock resources, but also on neighboring property values. The implications of our results for forest managers are discussed. 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{previously}} undescribed {{leaf spot}} of Centrosema spp. in Colombia and Costa Rica {{was found to}} be caused by Cylindrocladium colhounii. Symptoms included irregular, zonate, brown leaf spots, 10 – 30 mm in diameter; chlorosis; and defoliation. Pastures of Centrosema acutifolium cv. Vichada in the eastern plains of Colombia were <b>moderately</b> to severely <b>defoliated</b> under humid conditions. The host range of the pathogen was restricted to C. acutifolium, C. arenarium, C. brasilianum, C. macrocarpum, and C. pubescens. Usable resistance was identified in accessions of C. acutifolium from Minas Gerais and Goias, Brazil, as well as in other Centrosema spp. Peer-reviewe...|$|R
30|$|Virtually all-noticeable {{defoliation}} {{was limited}} to radiata pine. Isolated Pinus pinaster Ait. (maritime pine) trees within radiata pine stands were not affected (Fig.  2 b) indicating a difference in susceptibility between the two species. Defoliation was also not evident in stands of Quercus ilex (a priori, a preferred host) located within 3  km of the radiata pine plantation. Large numbers of egg masses (mean[*]=[*] 21.8 and 4.1; S.D.[*]=[*] 13.0 and 4.1, egg masses per tree for <b>moderately</b> and severely <b>defoliated</b> plots, respectively) were present on stems of radiata pine trees (Fig.  2 c). Larvae were observed feeding exclusively on radiata pine needles beginning with the first instar and continuing to pupation (Fig.  2 d). In {{other parts of the}} world, early instars are observed feeding on susceptible hosts (e.g. Quercus spp.) and then moving to resistant hosts (e.g. Pinus spp.) in late instars (Lance and Barbosa 1982). However, {{this was not the case}} here since defoliation occurred in pure radiata pine stands and susceptible hosts were not present in the understorey.|$|R
30|$|Cotton is a fiber crop with {{worldwide}} economic importance. It {{is vulnerable}} to some diseases such as Fusarium wilt and Verticillium wilt, which caused by the phytopathogenic fungus V. dahliae Kleb and could have severe {{detrimental effects on the}} cotton in China, the Americas, and Mediterranean regions (Cai et al. 2009; Gao et al. 2010). The soil-borne fungal pathogen has displayed extraordinary genetic plasticity and broad-hosts rang in diverse ecological niches (Fradin & Thomma 2006). They invade the vascular tissue by invading cortex of root via wounds or epidermal cells to cross the endodermis. The plant could show leaf vein browning, wilting, yellowing, vascular discoloration, defoliation and death after conidia are produced in large numbers and migrate via the xylem to the aerial part of the plants (Klosterman et al. 2009; BejaranoAlcazar et al. 1997). Consequently, Verticillium wilt {{is often referred to as}} the ‘cancer of cotton crops’. Therefore, the control against Verticillium wilt is necessary. However, it is also particularly difficult. The V. dahliae strains D 07038 and V 991 were used in this study and are moderately virulent and virulent, respectively. At the peak of infection, the defoliating type V 991 strain has a disease incidence of 99.10 % and a disease index of 81.98 relative to uninfected control plants (Fan & Jiang 2006). The <b>moderately</b> toxic and <b>defoliating</b> wild-type D 07038 strain was obtained from infected Gossypium hirsutum, plant and had a mean disease index of 46.1 %.|$|R
40|$|Detection {{of forest}} damage {{is one of}} the various remote sens-ing {{applications}} complicated by topographic effects. Different vegetation types are known to respond differently to slope and illumination effects. This paper describes the response of Landsat Thematic Mapper data to the topography in Nor-way spruce forest, and the possibility to assess forest damage in rugged t e m n. The effect at the examined medium and low solar elevations was non-Lambertian. Minnaert correc-tions and other empirical functions proposed for different cover types were found to be inadequate. Two new models were developed; one based on Minnaert constants changing with the cosine of the incidence angle, and the other based on an empirical relationship. Both models gave satisfactory results although the empirical model pe$ormed better for nearly shadowed northern slopes. With a model accounting for terrain and canopy inhomogeneity effects using digitized stand data and digital elevation models, healthy to slightly defoliated spruce forest could be separated from <b>moderately</b> <b>defoliated</b> forest. The method enables an improvement of the earlier documented Landsat TM capability to detect severely damaged forest...|$|E
40|$|Independent {{studies have}} shown that both the constant-stress and the elastic {{instability}} models describe the form of a plant 2 ̆ 7 s central stem. Teleologically, the constant stress model states that a stem tapers to equalize stress produced by wind pressure along the stem. The elastic instability model states that stems and branches taper to maintain similar elasticity throughout the tree and that total tree height is limited to about one-quarter of the height at which the stem would buckle under its own weight. We investigated the ability of these two models to describe the central stems of both mature and sapling Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelm. We also tested whether these two models are active in petiole formation by systematically defoliating Trifolium pratense L. The constant stress model adequately described stem taper in both age classes of P. contorta and the petiole form in T. pratense regardless of defoliation treatment. The elastic instability model was valid only for the mature P. contorta and for the control and perhaps for the <b>moderately</b> <b>defoliated</b> T. pratense. The constant stress model appears to be valid for both P. contorta and T. pratense while the elastic instability model is valid only for larger plants...|$|E
40|$|In closed-canopy forests, gap {{formation}} and closure {{are thought to}} be major drivers of forest dynamics. Crown defoliation by insects, however, may also influence understory resource levels and thus forest dynamics. We evaluate the effect of a forest tent caterpillar outbreak on understory light availability, soil nutrient levels and tree seedling height growth in six sites with contrasting levels of canopy defoliation in a hardwood forest in northern lower Michigan. We compared resource levels and seedling growth of six hardwood species before, during and in the three years after the outbreak (2008 - 2012). Canopy openness increased strongly during the forest tent caterpillar outbreak in the four moderately and severely defoliated sites, but not in lightly defoliated sites. Total inorganic soil nitrogen concentrations increased in response to the outbreak in moderately and severely defoliated sites. The increase in total inorganic soil nitrogen was driven by a strong increase in soil nitrate, and tended to become stronger with increasing site defoliation. Seedling height growth increased for all species in the moderately and severely defoliated sites, but not in lightly defoliated sites, either during the outbreak year or in the year after the outbreak. Growth increases did not become stronger with increasing site defoliation, but were strongest in a <b>moderately</b> <b>defoliated</b> site with high soil nutrient levels. Growth increases tended to be strongest for the shade intolerant species Fraxinus americana and Prunus serotina, and the shade tolerant species Ostrya virginiana. The strong growth response of F. americana and P. serotina suggests that recurring forest tent caterpillar outbreaks may facilitate the persistence of shade intolerant species in the understory in the absence of canopy gaps. Overall, our results suggest that recurrent canopy defoliation resulting from cyclical forest insect outbreaks may be an additional driver of dynamics in temperate closed-canopy forests...|$|E
40|$|Pojava propadanja i odumiranja stabala hrasta lužnjaka jedan je od najznačajnijih gospodarskih i ekoloških problema u šumarstvu Hrvatske. Gospodarski problemi odnose se na smanjenje kakvoće drva, poremećaje u potrajnom gospodarenju te povećanje troškova gospodarenja i smanjenje prihoda. Ekološki problemi odnose se na stalne promjene stanišnih uvjeta i smanjenje stabilnosti šumskih ekosustava. Cilj istraživanja bio je analizirati iskorištenje drvnog obujma različito oštećenih stabala hrasta lužnjaka. Prosječna osutost stabala uz cestu Županja - Lipovac iznosila je 57 %, a na području spačvanskih šuma 24 %. Utvrđeno je intenzivno odumiranje sta bala hrasta lužnjaka uz cestu Županja-Lipovac u 2003. godini, koje je iznosilo 30 %. U svim stupnjevima osutosti utvrđena su stabla s biotskim oštećenjima. Kod stabala sa značajnom osutošću krošanja (> 25 %) utvrđeno je smanjenje udjela tehničkog drva za oko 10 %, odnosno isto toliko povećanje otpada. Udio furnirskih trupaca kod stabala male i srednje osutosti bio je 50 % veći u odnosu na jako osuta i odumrla stabla. U radu je raspravljena problematika ukupnog iskorištenja drva pri sječi i izradbi te vrijednost drvnih sortimenata vitalnih stabala u odnosu na oštećena i odumrla stabla hrasta lužnjaka. Management with {{forests of}} pedunculate oak, the {{principal}} commercial tree species in Croatia, is burdened with increasing instances of tree decline and dieback. A combination of factors, such as decreased height and diameter increment, lower value of wood assortments, disturbances {{in planning and}} management and rising management costs, have made this the most important management and ecological problem in Croatian forestry. Tree decline is a gradual, continuous, or in some cases, rapid loss of tree vita lity. In forestry, tree decline is assessed {{on the basis of}} the exterior appearance of a tree, i. e. on the basis of tree damage assessment. Tree damage relates to crown, stem and root damage. Crown damage assessment is based on crown defoliation and changes in leaf colour. Tree dieback is sudden death of trees due to diseases or a complex action of adverse factors. It can often stem from a continuous decline of trees and a disturbed stability of forest ecosystems. In Croatia, the most severely affected tree species are the two principal ones: pe dunculate oak and silver fir. Tree decline and dieback incur high financial los ses, amounting to as much as 40 % of the potential market value of forest assortments. However, a decrease in non-market forest functions is much more serious. The economic consequences of tree decline are reflected on the quality and lower value of wood assortments. Dieback of pedunculate oak trees leads to sapwood degradation and a decrease in assortment diameter, which may amount to as much as 33 % of the diameter. The goal of research was to determine the impact of pedunculate oak da mage on the structure and volume of wood assortments. Research was con ducted on tree samples from four management units in Vinkovci ForestAdministration, along the Županja - Lipovac road. Wood volume utilization of dead and differently damaged trees of pedunculate oak was analyzed. Tree crowns along the Županja - Lipovac road were found to be more defo liated compared to those in the “Spačva basin” area. Crown defoliation of pe­dunculate oak was about 60 %, which indicates decreased tree vitality. Severely defoliated and dead trees manifested significantly higher biotic da mage in relation to slightly and <b>moderately</b> <b>defoliated</b> trees. The percentage share of veneer logs and class I logs, as well as stacked wood, was higher in trees with the first and second defoliation class. The share of lower class logs (II and III class), as well as the percentage share of waste was higher in trees with higher defoliation classes. Of the total wood volume, there were 20 % of veneer logs in defoliation classes 1 and 2 (slight and moderate defoliation), and 10 % of veneer logs in defoliation classes 3 and 4 (severe defoliation). Ac cording to the percentage share of assortments in the total technical roun dwood, there were 37 % of veneer logs in trees with defoliation classes 1 and 2, and 18 % of veneer logs in defoliation classes 3 and 4. The proportion of lower-class technical assortments was higher in higher classes of crown defo liation. The proportion of second class logs in defoliation classes 1 and 2 was 11 %, and in defoliation classes 3 and 4 it was 19 %. The proportion of third class logs in defoliation classes 1 and 2 was 15 %, while in defoliation classes 3 and 4 it reached 19 %. There was more waste in defoliation classes 3 and 4 (30 %), and slightly less in defoliation classes 1 and 2 (27 %). Tree damage lowers the quality of logs and lessens the income from pedun culate oak management. Tree damage assessment may reduce the amount of snags and increase management yields. Timely and appropriate tree damage assessments have a positive effect on overall management with pedunculate oak. The selection of damaged trees for felling is a key factor that ensures the quality of the wood matter in disturbed and unstable forest ecosystems...|$|E
