This results to generation of wastewater containing glycols. Anaerobic treatment may represent {{an alternative to the}} aerobic treatment of glycol wastewater. Laboratory-scale studies were carried out to investigate the treatability of glycol wastewater using anaerobic digester reactor. The substrate is a high strength wastewater of about 15000 mg/l COD consisting mostly of <b>monoethylene</b> <b>glycols</b> (MEG) with a pH of 5. 4. The microbes used for this study were those from the sewage sludge of IVAR sewage plant and process conditions namely temperature, pH, nutrient requirements, and organic loading rate were optimized to ensure efficient biodegradation. The wastewater treatability and the reactor performance were examined during the study based on the COD removal. Also, the effects of parameters such as pH, SRT, organic loading rate and alkalinity on the COD removal and gas production were monitored. This study was carried out in two experiments. The first experiment was a continuation of an existing working anaerobic reactor while the second was a new system set up. The composition of the nutrients added during the 2 nd experiment differs slightly from that of the 1 st experiment. From the results in both experiments, there was more gas production in experiment 2 than in experiment. At maximum gas production, COD mass balances of 34. 4 % and 83. 67 % were obtained in experiment 1 and experiment 2 respectively.

40|$|We {{address a}} novel method for {{analytical}} determinations that combines simplicity, rapidity, low consumption of chemicals, and portability with high analytical performance {{taking into account}} parameters such as precision, linearity, robustness, and accuracy. This approach relies {{on the effect of}} the analyte content over the Gibbs free energy of dispersions, affecting the thermodynamic stabilization of emulsions or Winsor systems to form microemulsions (MEs). Such phenomenon was expressed by the minimum volume fraction of amphiphile required to form microemulsion, which was the analytical signal of the method. The performed studies were: phase behavior, droplet dimension by dynamic light scattering, analytical curve, and robustness tests. The reliability of the method was evaluated by determining water in ethanol fuels and <b>monoethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> in complex samples of liquefied natural gas. The dispersions were composed of water-chlorobenzene (water analysis) and water-oleic acid (<b>monoethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> analysis) with ethanol as the hydrotrope phase. The experiments to determine water demonstrated that the analytical performance depends on the composition of ME. The linear range was fairly broad with limits of linearity up to 70. 00 % water in ethanol. For <b>monoethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> in water the linear range was observed throughout the volume fraction of analyte.
