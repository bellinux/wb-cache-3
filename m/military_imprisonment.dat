50|$|Although Forché is {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} political poet, she considers herself a poet who is politically engaged. After first acquiring both fame and notoriety for her second volume of poems, The Country Between Us, she pointed out that this reputation rested on {{a limited number of}} poems describing what she personally had experienced in El Salvador during the Salvadoran Civil War. Her aesthetic is more one of rendered experience and at times of mysticism rather than one of ideology or agitprop. Forché is particularly interested in the effect of political trauma on the poet's use of language. The anthology Against Forgetting was intended to collect the work of poets who had endured the impress of extremity during the 20th century, whether through their engagements or force of circumstance. These experiences included warfare, <b>military</b> occupation, <b>imprisonment,</b> torture, forced exile, censorship, and house arrest. The anthology, composed of the work of one hundred and forty-five poets writing in English and translated from over thirty languages, begins with the Armenian Genocide and ends with the uprising of the pro-Democracy movement at Tiananmen Square. Although she was not guided in her selections by the political or ideological persuasions of the poets, Forché believes the sharing of painful experience to be radicalizing, returning the poet to an emphasis on community rather than the individual ego. In this she was strongly influenced by Terrence des Pres.|$|R

40|$|The Franco regime thrived by {{claiming}} its supporters constituted the ‘true Spain’ pitched against the ‘anti-Spain’. Much of this thinking lives on and historian Hilari Raguer has led recent efforts {{to reveal a}} third Spain. Prominent in this group that neither supported the left nor swung behind Francoism stand {{the large number of}} Basque priests placed on military trial and imprisoned for their support of Basque nationalism. Rather than highlight this group as the ‘third Spain’, however, this chapter explores one of the central processes by which Francoists sought to reduce Basque priests to members of the ‘anti-Spain’. It does this by studying the prosecution in <b>military</b> tribunals and <b>imprisonment</b> of scores of these priests. This examination reveals that precisely because members of the Basque clergy disrupted the binaries of Francoism forged through the Civil War, they came to be viewed as implacable enemies by many within the Francoist camp who pressed for their conviction in the face of significant domestic and foreign opposition. Offering a veneer of respectability, prosecution also provided a means of sifting ‘friend’ from ‘foe’ by deploying fine grained information obtained from civil society to target political enemies and break the back of clerical opposition...|$|R
5000|$|Kesselring (Edizioni Mursia, Milano, 2009) is a {{biography}} of Albert Kesselring, a German Luftwaffe general, during World War II. The general was born in november 30th 1885 in Marktsteft (German empire) and died in a sanatorium in Bad Nauheim in West Germany, on 16 July 1960 {{at the age of}} 74, following a heart attack. He {{was one of the most}} skillful and highly decorated commanders of Nazi Germany. The biography focuses on the general's <b>military</b> feats, his <b>imprisonment</b> and his participation to the Nuremberg trials(1946) as a witness, and to the trials in Venice (1947) as an accused. The structure of the biography is a historical-judiciary thriller, which is one of the characteristics that made this novel one of Vasco Ferretti's most relevant works. Author Ovidio Dallera in a review of Kesselring describes General Kesselring as a character who earned his notoriety unlike many historical characters who have obtained an undeserved 'fame'. Vasco Ferretti, has been the first historical researcher that has brought the acts of the process against Albert Kesselring in Italy, from the War Office in Kew (London), from which he also drew the book Vernichten. Kesselring by Vasco Ferretti isn't the only book regarding the general, since other writings about him could also be found, for example: Kesselring's own biography written by himself during his combat years, Albert Kesselring written by P. Paolo Battistelli [...] and Kesselring: the making of the Luftwaffe written by Kenneth Macksey.|$|R
