5|$|This attack, {{and similar}} attacks {{carried out by}} the GAL, became a major issue during the 1996 Spanish general {{election}} after a Supreme court trial established that the Spanish Interior Ministry had provided clandestine funding for the GAL. Spanish Interior Minister José Barrionuevo and his security chief, Rafael Vera, were jailed for ten years for sanctioning a kidnapping and <b>misappropriation</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>funds</b> to finance the group, and the GAL scandal is seen as a key factor in the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) losing the election, though more senior figures in the PSOE, such as Felipe Gonzalez, denied knowledge and involvement.|$|E
5|$|As the Monbar {{case and}} similar cases came to light, the GAL issue became {{increasingly}} controversial in the 1990s, with questions over whether {{members of the}} Spanish government and state security service had known about the group's operations in places like Bayonne and, if so, to what extent they had supported and funded the attacks. This became a major issue during the 1996 Spanish general election with Spanish Interior Minister, José Barrionuevo, and his security chief, Rafael Vera, implicated in the GAL case. In 1998, both were jailed for ten years for sanctioning a kidnapping and <b>misappropriation</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>funds</b> to finance the GAL.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine how the public sector corporate governance in Brunei Darussalam - a member of ASEAN - is embedded in country&# 039;s political and economic environment. Specifically,the <b>misappropriation</b> <b>of</b> billions <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>funds</b> in 1997 led to serious financial problems and ultimately to the fact that a substantial portion of the country&# 039;s financial resources, controlled by the Royal family, had been dissipated through individual profligacy. Consequently, the Brunei Government made various efforts to examine the economic crisis and to find options for future financial recovery. This paper critically examines the corporate governance structure in Brunei Darussalam. The findings of this study provide evidence of the importance of considering the institutional influences in successful adoption of proper goverance in Brunei...|$|R

40|$|In the {{politics}} of Newfoundland, during the first ten years of Responsible Government (1855 - 1865), sectarianism played a very important role. From 1865 to 1869, however, during F. B. T. Carter’s first Administration, this role was lessened. Carter included Roman Catholics in his Executive Council and, {{with the development of}} the Confederation issue, sectarianism was relegated to a position of relative insignificance. In 1869, Charles Fox Bennett led his Anti-Confederate Party to an overwhelming victory at the polls. The Anti-Confederates won the election by playing on the fears of the electorate - fears of increased taxation, of military conscription, and of the loss of independence. As the result of a vigorous and exhaustive campaign, the Anti-Confederates won seventy per cent of the seats in the House of Assembly. Many of these members were inexperienced, however, and most of the leaders represented Roman Catholic Districts. [...] Gradually the Confederates, realizing the impossibility at that time of effecting a union with Canada, turned again to sectarianism. Bennett’s Party, although it tried, was unable to quell the growing demand for a Protestant Government. In an attempt to divide the Protestants, Bennett condemned the Orange Society as undesirable. This was a miscalculation. Little if any, support was gained and the Orangemen were further alienated. The Government, which was often ineffective, stagnated. It was involved in a dispute with the New York, Newfoundland, London Telegraphy Company and it Act giving effect to the Washington Treaty was disallowed. In addition to these problems, rumor <b>of</b> <b>misappropriations</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>funds</b> became prevalent. [...] In the election of 1873, Bennett was returned to power with a majority of only three. Notwithstanding this, before the House of Assembly met, two members of the Government Party withdrew from the house and one member joined the Opposition. Bennett’s Government resigned and Carter came to power. In the election of 1874, the Protestant districts supported Carter’s Party and the Roman Catholic Districts supported Bennett. Sectarianism was again as important as it had been before Carter had come to power in 1865. Politics in Newfoundland had come full cycle. ...|$|R

Subsequent investigations found atypically high property tax rates, allegations of voter fraud in municipal elections and other irregularities which heightened the ensuing scandal. These and other reports led to widespread criticism and a demand for city officials to resign.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the role theory and audit expectation gap {{and the performance}} of internal auditors in the prevention <b>of</b> financial <b>misappropriation</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> in the <b>public</b> sector <b>of</b> South South Nigeria. Audit expectation gap is the difference between the levels of expected performance as envisioned by the users of financial statements and by the independent accountant. To achieve the objective of this paper, data were collected from primary and secondary sources. The primary source was generated from a well structured questionnaire administered to 120 internal auditors in Bayelsa State and Cross Rivers State in South South Nigeria. The researchers only collected 96 usable questionnaires that were analysed using Spearman rank order correlation coefficient, Mann-Whitney U test and descriptive statistics. The study revealed that there is a significant relationship between audit expectation gap and internal auditors in the prevention financial <b>misappropriation</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> in the <b>public</b> and there is significant difference between the perceptions of auditors and users whether the intervention of management hinders the effective performance of internal auditors in South South, Nigeria. On the basis of the findings, the paper concludes that internal auditors in the public sector in Nigeria is not performing the audit responsibility with all level of professional and technical expertise as expected by the society. This is why there is wide spread <b>misappropriation</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> sector <b>funds</b> and massive corruption in Nigeria. Therefore, the paper recommends amongst others that internal auditors in all ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) should have the requisite professional qualification (example, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria), the issuance of new audit standards for public sector accounting system...|$|R
40|$|Nigeria’s Vision 2020 is a {{national}} effort aimed at growing and developing the country and bringing her to the league of the world’s 20 leading economies by year 2020. To attain this objective, sound economy, good governance and sustainable development {{have been identified as}} essential vehicles for transforming the economy and the lives of Nigerians. This desire further necessitates the need for a globally competitive public sector that is largely fraud and corruption free. Fraud is a significant problem to the world economy of today. In Nigeria, the government parastatals are known for the increased and alarming rate <b>of</b> fraud, <b>misappropriation</b> and embezzlement <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>funds,</b> growing inefficiency and ineffectiveness relative to the private sector, ghost workers, weak institutional structure, poor accountability, excessive centralization of administrative power, and undue rivalry between generalist administrators and professionals. This paper examines the role forensic accounting plays in public sector global competitiveness in delivering vision 2020, using Nigeria as a focus point. The research method employs the use of survey research design and engages the Kruskal-Wallis statistical test for analysis. The research finds that fraud and corruption are fundamental problems <b>of</b> the Nigerian <b>public</b> sector and that forensic accountants can assist in ensuring compliance of government units, businesses, and individuals, with regulations at all levels towards the 2020 vision attainment. The paper recommends, among others, the strengthening of forensic accounting institutions and their increased engagement in public sector services delivery towards vision 2020 agenda actualization...|$|R
