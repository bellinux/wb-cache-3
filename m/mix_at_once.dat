5000|$|The [...] "Groove Editor" [...] {{allows for}} in depth {{manipulation}} of samples collected. Several tracks can be <b>mixed</b> <b>at</b> <b>once,</b> controlling speed, pitch, frequency and modulation {{with a series}} of coloured crystals. Mixes can be saved to memory card, and then played during levels. Controlling the dolphin allowed the player to add improvisations during the playback sessions, frequency being mapped to the up/ down controls, and modulation to left/ right.|$|R

50|$|Mixing: The {{ingredients}} are all {{placed in a}} <b>mixing</b> bowl <b>at</b> <b>once</b> and combined together. A variation of this technique is to add ingredients sequentially. This mixing process may be done by hand kneading or by machine. Once fermentation has commenced, it will continue until {{the heat of the}} oven kills the yeast during baking. For fast fermentations, long, intense mixing techniques are recommended for dough development, whereas for long-fermented doughs, short-mixing techniques on slow speeds or hand kneading may be used with sufficient later folding.|$|R
50|$|It {{was one of}} {{the many}} curious {{developments}} of the <b>mixed</b> taste, <b>at</b> <b>once</b> cumbrous and bizarre, which prevailed in furniture during the Empire period in England. The earliest chiffoniers date from that time; they are usually of rosewood - the favorite timber of that moment; their furniture (the technical name for knobs, handles, and escutcheons) was most commonly of brass, and there was very often a raised shelf with a pierced brass gallery at the back. The doors were well panelled and often edged with brass-beading, while the feet were pads or claws, or, in the choicer examples, sphinxes in gilded bronze.|$|R
2500|$|Traditional {{mayonnaise}} is {{a mixture}} of egg, vinegar, oil and spices (especially mustard). Mayonnaise made in this fashion typically contains 70–80% fat. Despite the high oil content relative to water, mayonnaise is an oil-in-water emulsion. This emulsion is formed by first mixing the eggs, vinegar and mustard and then slowly blending in the oil. This results in an emulsion consisting of a closely packed [...] "foam" [...] of oil droplets. By contrast, if the oil and aqueous phases are <b>mixed</b> all <b>at</b> <b>once</b> the result is a water-in-oil emulsion similar in viscosity to the oil from which it is made. Without an emulsifying agent oil floats on top of water forming separate layers.|$|R

50|$|Carrasco, a doubles specialist, {{appeared}} in 17 Grand Slams during his career. He {{competed in the}} men's doubles on each occasion and also played <b>mixed</b> doubles <b>once,</b> <b>at</b> the 2000 Wimbledon Championships with Gisela Riera as his partner. Carrasco and Riera made the third round, which was also the furthest he ever reached in the men's doubles, at the 2000 French Open with Jairo Velasco, Jr. En route, the pair defeated ninth seeds Mahesh Bhupathi and David Prinosil.|$|R
30|$|Kroc was a 52 year-old Dixie Cup {{salesman}} when {{he learned}} of a new product called the Multimixer, which <b>mixed</b> several milkshakes <b>at</b> <b>once.</b> When Kroc quit his paper-cup job to sell Multimixers, he became acquainted with Mac and Dick McDonald in San Bernardino, California. He observed their fast-food operation firsthand in 1954 and was amazed at the assemblyline production. All the operation needed, he thought, was his Multimixers. Working out {{a deal with the}} brothers for the name, Kroc opened his first location in Des Plaines, Illinois, and after more than a year, he had enough money to open other locations. Within five years Kroc, well past the mid-century mark, had 200 restaurants. Within another seven years the company would open 100 new stores per year (Schweikart 2001).|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the DVJ turntable players (virtually all DJs have two players for their [...] "native" [...] media of vinyl, CD, or DVD; some have additional players to accommodate other media, or they <b>mix</b> multiple sources <b>at</b> <b>once),</b> [...] "DVJing" [...] {{requires the use of}} an audio-visual mixing console, which allows the DVJ to select sources for audio and video and to blend or mix them. Many mixers also give the DVJ the ability to perform simple transformations on the video. Just as an audio mixing console allows for changes in equalizer levels, dynamics, and balance, an A/V mixer allows variations in hue, color saturation, brightness, sharpness, and other [...] "TV-type" [...] settings. They also allow for various types of transitions between video clips, such as fades, blends, and wipes. A/V mixers are nothing new to the recording and performance industry, but they are more often found in production rooms of television stations or editing suites of movie studios and are a new feature of live turntablist performances.|$|R

Physiol Behav 62 (1) 181 – 184, 1997. —The present study describes an experiment that {{was carried out}} to {{study the effects of}} <b>mixing</b> pigs <b>once</b> <b>at</b> 25 kg, preceded by transportation for 1. 5 h, on the behavior and the circadian rhythmicity of salivary cortisol. The frequency of agonistic interactions was higher for mixed pigs. This was not only the case immediately after mixing, when pigs started to fight to establish a new social rank (p < 0. 05), but also 5 to 6 weeks later; still more headknocks and bites towards other pigs were seen at that time among mixed pigs (p < 0. 01). However, neither the basal cortisol concentration, assessed as the MESOR of the circadian rhythm of salivary cortisol, nor the amplitude of that rhythm was different between the groups...|$|R
