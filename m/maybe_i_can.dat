The Clinton camp {{continued to}} suggest that Obama {{would make a good}} vice presidential candidate for Clinton, and former President Bill Clinton made known his support of this as a [...] "dream ticket" [...] which would be an [...] "almost unstoppable force". On March 10, Obama flatly rejected such suggestions. Obama noted that he, not [...] Clinton, held the lead in pledged delegates and that he had won more of the popular vote than Clinton. [...] "I don't know how somebody who is in second place is offering the vice presidency to somebody who is in first place", he said. He told supporters in Columbus, Mississippi, that Clinton's VP suggestion was an example of what he called [...] "the old okey-doke", further stating that the Clinton camp was trying to [...] "bamboozle" [...] or [...] "hoodwink" [...] voters., Biloxi Sun Herald, March 10, 2008 Obama wondered aloud why the Clinton campaign believed him competent for the vice presidency, but said he was [...] "not ready" [...] to be president. Obama stated that the nomination process {{would have to be a}} choice between himself and Clinton, saying [...] "I don't want anybody here thinking that 'Somehow, <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> get both'," [...] by nominating Clinton as president and assuming he would be her running mate". Some suggested that it was a ploy by the Clinton campaign to denigrate Obama as less qualified for the presidency.|$|E

"Before {{proceeding}} further I {{must say}} that to a large extent, though not completely, I agree with his take on the histories of both the United States and baseball, not because he convinced me, but because I already had arrived there on my own. That said I still found some of his conclusions overdrawn. That and the necessary complexity of the argument are what makes for the daunting narrative.
