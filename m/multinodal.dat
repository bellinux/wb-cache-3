This project develops two strategies to improve delivery speed, reliability, and cost for digital retailers operating in key North American markets (i. e. New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago). Zone Skipping Transportation This project develops a zone skipping transportation model and associated business case for retailers with multiple consumer channels (i. e. digital and brick and mortar). Zone skipping pools digital and retail shipments, utilizing dedicated ground transportation of product from central distribution hubs to last-mile delivery hubs in key cities. For reasonable input parameters, zone skipping {{is shown to}} improve delivery speed by 20 %, improve on-time delivery performance by 20 %, and reduce costs by 10 % over traditional carrier zone shipping. <b>Multinodal</b> Distribution (Ship-from-Store Simulation) Many multi-channel retailers employ <b>multinodal</b> distribution networks, but desire store fulfillment capabilities in key cities to improve key delivery metrics (speed and cost). To validate these capabilities, retailers can develop easily-tailorable analytical simulation models to test various hypotheses and distribution parameters. This project helps address two major ship-from-store questions: 1. What to Ship - A SKU stocking strategy that minimizes variability and ensures predictable and right-sized demand levels. The strategy needs to accurately predict future demand based on limited historical information. 2. How to Fulfill - The transformation of a store back room into a mini distribution center {{and all of the}} processes design to enable rapid fulfillment time given highly variable demand The SKU stocking strategy leverages advanced analytics, and the operational fulfillment processes are tested using simulation software that enables rapid manipulation of key variables to uncover optimal process flows. The resulting simulation model and SKU stocking framework can be leveraged by digital retailers to operationalize ship from store processes and accurately predict digital demand levels for future store fulfillment nodes. by Jordan Daniel Charles.

The targeted regional allele-specific oligonucleotide PCR (TRAP) assay presented here is based on allele-specific PCR targeting strain-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms, identified from WGS, and makes it possible to track actively transmitted Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. A TRAP assay was optimized to track the most actively transmitted strains in a population in Almería, Southeast Spain, with high rates of TB. TRAP was transferred to the local laboratory where transmission was occurring. It performed well from cultured isolates and directly from sputa, enabling new secondary cases of infection from the actively transmitted strains to be detected. TRAP constitutes a fast, simple and low-cost tool that could modify surveillance of TB transmission.

40|$|Meaning in {{architecture}} has isotropic instances of realization, {{one that can}} unfold during the design process and {{one that can be}} layered onto the artifact of the building, its components and forms constitute a communication flow that emerges from an abstract form of description to its physicality. The internal cognition of this condition situates the subject as the third element, one that identifies the meaning from the extant building to its proxy meaning. In this manner, narrative and aesthetics perform the actualizations (the spatial and physical sequences) so that the occupant may understand its implications. 1 Architecture is thus a one-directional flow of information (the building is an inert object from which meaning is derived, its physicality is static). Even in process-driven design, the synthesis of the many and the ordered, is evident in the materiality of the architectural manifestation, the building, although presented as a result of process cannot be separated from the reading of the generative operations. 2 Rather than continue in this manner of constructing meaning from an extensive coding (joining a concept to an object) or the instantiation (producing one from a larger field of possibilities) from a version, we suggest a dialectic that is bi-directional, or even <b>multinodal,</b> that is, continually self-renewing in meaning and material configuration with the active participation of the occupant.

The Spanish economy is an attractive sector for Asian investment and business initiatives, that receives projects and initiatives already tested in other places, or new ones, particularly adapted to the local factors. The diasporas that have taken place, can be categorised, in general terms, into three typologies: the commercial diaspora, the elite and “bottom-up transnationalism”; three models of transnationalism which –in Spain– have demonstrated great adaptability and {{a high level of}} integration into the social and economic life of the welcoming country.

The spectrum of lymph node presentation has lead to a host of trials involving various therapeutic combinations, and optimal management has been unclear. Methods:In 2007 and 2008, 10 live research events surveyed the practice preferences of American medical oncologists using two hypothetical scenarios. The first scenario was of a stage IIIA NSCLC in the right upper lobe with a single enlarged (> 1 cm) 4 R lymph node found to be malignant by mediastinoscopy. The second was of a bulky stage IIIA NSCLC with multistation N 2 pathologically positive nodes. Results:In the first scenario, 373 (92 %) of the oncologists incorporated surgery into their treatment plan. Only 34 (8 %) offered chemoradiotherapy alone. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by surgery and then additional chemoradiotherapy (32 %), was the most commonly offered treatment strategy. In the second scenario, 209 (52 %) medical oncologists chose definitive chemoradiation. A total of 193 (48 %) included surgery as part of the treatment plan. Conclusions:The current standard of care for IIIA N 2 NSCLC recognized before treatment is concurrent chemoradiotherapy. This study demonstrated that a significant proportion of oncologists treating locally advanced lung cancer include surgery as part of the treatment plan more so in single versus <b>multinodal</b> station disease. Since node positive locally advanced disease is such a common presentation for patients with lung cancer, well-designed clinical trials are needed to define the most advantageous treatment strategy for individual subsets of patients with stage IIIA disease...|$|E

A previsão a curto prazo ajuda a estimar o fluxo de carga, tomar decisões de prevenção de sobrecargas, entre outras ações que são rotineiramente executadas. Para realizar a previsão é necessário identificar os padrões do comportamento de consumo e da sua relação com as variáveis externas do ambiente no sistema. A maioria dos estudos de previsões de cargas é realizada utilizando métodos estatísticos, onde é necessário modelar a carga matematicamente.

Load forecasting is {{an essential}} activity for the operation of electric power systems {{and contribute to the}} planning and operation in order to ensure the supply of electricity to consumers in a secure, reliable and economical way. The short-term forecasting aids estimating the load flow, makes decisions to prevent overloads, among other actions that are routinely performed. It is necessary to identify the consumer behavior patterns and the relationship with the external environment variables of the system to perform the forecasting. The estimated load is determined via the following predictors. Many studies of load forecasting use statistical methods, where it is necessary to mathematically model the load. While providing good results in using complex methods it is difficult to model. The artificial intelligence techniques provided a new tool capable of modeling a large amount of data loads and build the relationship between the variables of the system. Among these intelligent techniques there are the neural networks and fuzzy logic which are used to load forecasting. This research presents a method for short-term <b>multinodal</b> electrical load forecasting (at various points of main interest), using an artificial neural network architecture based on ART (Adaptive Resonance Theory) neural network called ART-ARTMAP Fuzzy. ART neural networks have fundamental characteristics, stability and plasticity, to train and provide fast and reliable results. The method was implemented in Matlab platform where it was possible to perform the prediction, for example, for a system composed of nine substations. In order to evaluate the results obtained by the predictions the maximum percentage error of the forecast and the average percentage error were calculated. Historical load data yielded by the Electricity Commission of New Zealand are used to execute the training and [...] . (Complete abstract click electronic access below...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{results from}} Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0617, a dose {{escalation}} trial that compared treatment with 60 Gy versus 74 Gy {{for patients with}} stage III {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC), suggested that in these patients, the heart dose from radiation therapy correlates with survival. In particular, the study noted that patients with a high heart V 5 and V 30 had a poorer overall survival; however, the exact cause of this correlation is not known. We hypothesize that heart dose may be a surrogate for mediastinal nodal involvement, which has prognostic value in NSCLC. This study evaluates the relationship between heart dose and involvement of mediastinal lymph nodes in patients with stage III NSCLC treated with radiation therapy. Methods and materials: A total of 56 patients were identified and treated with definitive radiation therapy from 2007 to 2014. The heart was recontoured for every patient by a single physician, per the RTOG 1106 contouring atlas. We assessed lymph node station involvement using pretreatment data, and nodal coverage was confirmed on plan review. Results: Mean heart dose was found to be significantly higher in patients with <b>multinodal</b> station and level 7 involvement. On Spearman's rank correlation, level 7 was significantly associated with all heart parameters tested (P <. 001). Patients who had 2 or more lymph node stations involved were found to have significantly higher heart doses for all parameters tested when compared with those who had only one station involved or no nodal involvement. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that heart dose may be a surrogate for other prognostic factors in stage III NSCLC rather than an independent predictor of outcome...|$|E
40|$|A {{systematic}} review of randomised, controlled trials was undertaken {{to determine the}} effectiveness of manual therapy for mechanical neck disorders in reducing pain and disability in adult populations. Neck pain is a common ailment that can result in pain, disability and considerable cost. Manual therapy is a treatment modality commonly sought by patients to manage neck pain. A literature search of MEDLINE, CENTRAL, CINHAL, SPORTdiscus, PEDro and MANTIS was conducted. Articles were included if manual therapy was performed on one group within the trial, on participants with mechanical neck pain, including neck disorders with associated headache. Studies were excluded if the cause of neck pain was serious pathology, systemic disease, or trauma, or if neck pain was associated with radicular findings, or the headache was the primary disorder. Five trials involving 995 participants were included; four of the trials were of high methodological quality according to the validated Jadad criteria. Due to the heterogeneity of {{the data from the}} included trials, the studies could not be pooled for meta-analysis and a qualitative analysis was performed instead. Strong evidence demonstrated that manual therapy was not significantly superior to other interventions (exercise, physical therapy, medication, short wave diathermy) for relief of neck pain. Patients who received manual therapy reported being significantly more satisfied with their care than patients who received any other single therapy. A trend across three of the studies showed that manual therapy combined with exercise returned moderately larger improvements, although not statistically significant, improvements in pain, disability and patient-perceived recovery than manual therapy alone. Results in favour of combined therapies suggest <b>multinodal</b> care, including manual therapy and exercise, may be a potentially useful intervention in the treatment of mechanical neck disorders...|$|E
40|$|A {{software}} tool {{was developed for}} the stochastic simulation of multiple traits and uses sequential culling for the different traits. It selects superior progeny and, at present, can calculate genetic gain from the backward selection of parent clones based on progeny performance, crossing those parent clones, and forwards selection among the progeny. Key information input to the program includes the base population size, number of parents selected, economic weights for different traits, genetic correlations between traits, mating design and number of crosses, number of progeny planted and selected, and proportion culled within the progeny for each trait. An application of the software, with particular relevance to the Pinus radiata D. Don breeding population in New Zealand, deals {{with the development of}} breeds for specific products and for specific site types. Gains obtained at age 8 from different selection emphases were compared, for an unspecialised main population of 300 parents and four specialised breeds of 24 parents each. The parents came from a base population of 2000 progeny-tested parents. The simulation covered forwards selection in the progeny obtained by crossing the selected parents. The breeds were designated Structural Timber, Growth and Form Elite, Long Internode, and Fibre, and reflected different end-product objectives. Six traits were involved—namely dbh, stem straightness score, needle retention score, branch cluster frequency score, spiral-grain angle, and wood density. The simulation provided support for differentiating a Structural Timber breed (with a strongly <b>multinodal</b> branching habit, higher wood density, and reduced spiral grain angle). As well, we were able to simulate breeds similar to the existing Long Internode breed and a Growth and Form Elite population. The software {{can also be used to}} study the effect of varying population size...|$|E
