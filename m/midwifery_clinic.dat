The two goals of the Lobenstein School were to “1) supervise and teach untrained midwives and 2) bring skilled maternity care [...] to women in remote rural areas.” The MCA modeled its midwifery curriculum after European, particularly British examples. It required registered nurses to complete a ten-month midwifery program. Secondly, around the same time in 1931, MCA established the Lobenstine <b>Midwifery</b> <b>Clinic,</b> which served predominately poor African Americans or Puerto Ricans in Harlem who needed the services. The <b>Midwifery</b> <b>Clinic</b> encouraged prenatal care for its patients, who averaged 7.7 prenatal visits from 1933 to 1952. In incidents of complications, midwives at the Clinic would also refer patients to the care of a physician. These efforts certainly contributed to the low maternal mortality rate at the MCA. Between 1932 and 1936, MCA births had a maternal mortality rate of 10 (per 10,000) compared to 104 for New York City and 56.8 to 63.3 for the nation.|$|E

Methods: van Kaam’s Psychophenomenological method composed of a four-stage, 12 -step format was used. In-depth interviews were carried out from January to July, 2011, with twelve women. Results: Through the data analysis, 403 significant statements, 172 elements, 48 subcategories, and 19 categories were extracted, and from the 19 categories, 8 themes were drawn. The eight themes were: “Conflict on whether a hospital or a midwifery clinic”, “Choosing natural delivery with the assurance of her ability to delivery spontaneously and having trust in the midwives. ” “Being encouraged by a midwife and family members with one accord”, “Experience of the spontaneous delivery process on body”, “Comfortable delivery in spite of painful process”, “Deeply impressed by the overwhelming joy of birth”, “Satisfaction with spontaneous delivery”, and "Deeper love among family members". Conclusion: Through this study, women’s delivery experiences with midwives was of spon-taneous delivery. Women’s birth of self-confidence and trust between the midwives and the women to predict a spon-taneous delivery is a powerful factor. Also, family support and midwives delicate care was identified as factors in spontaneous delivery...|$|R
40|$|Worldwide, {{sustained}} breastfeeding {{rates are}} lower than optimal. Mothers and infants with suboptimal breastfeeding present {{to a wide variety}} of practitioners to assist their goal of total breastfeeding. To support these mother-infant dyads, a multi-disciplinary chiropractic and <b>midwifery</b> feeding <b>clinic</b> was opened alongside a chiropractic teaching clinic in England. To improve understanding of the presentation and clinical needs of these nursing dyads, a descriptive study was developed. This paper provides an overview of the cases that presented to this clinic over nine months, with a focus on feeding difficulties, birth and musculoskeletal problems in the infant. Mothers frequently reported more than one type of feeding problem, which most commonly included difficulty attaching, painful feeding, and a one sided feeding preference. Birth intervention was more common in this population than the national averages, particularly forceps deliveries. Musculoskeletal problems were prevalent in the babies presented to the feeding clinic, most commonly of the thoracic spine, cervical spine and sternocleidomastoid. Although causation cannot be established from this type of study, intervention at birth, feeding difficulties and musculoskeletal problems frequently coexisted in these infants. Therefore, including musculoskeletal care for infants as part of support for suboptimal breastfeeding may be appropriate...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To explore {{perceptions}} of safety culture in nine {{different types of}} primary care professions and to study possible differences. Design Cross-sectional survey: Setting: Three hundred and thirteen practices from nine types of primary care profession groups in the Netherlands. Participants: Professional staff from primary care practices. Nine professions participated: dental care, dietetics, exercise therapy, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, <b>midwifery,</b> anticoagulation <b>clinics,</b> skin therapy and speech therapy. Main Outcome Measure(s) : Perceptions of seven patient safety culture dimensions were measured: ‘open communication and learning from error’, ‘handover and teamwork’, ‘adequate procedures and working conditions’, ‘patient safety management’, ‘support and fellowship’, ‘intention to report events’ and ‘organizational learning’. Dimension means per profession were presented, and multilevel analyses {{were used to assess}} differences between professions. Also the so-called patient safety grade was self-reported. Results: Five hundred and nineteen practices responded (response rate: 24 %) of which 313 (625 individual questionnaires) were included for analysis. Overall, patient safety culture was perceived as being positive. Occupational therapy and anticoagulation therapy deviated most from other professions in a negative way, whereas physiotherapy deviated the most in a positive way. In addition, most professions graded their patient safety as positive (mean = 4. 03 on a five-point scale). Conclusions: This study showed that patient safety culture in Dutch primary care professions on average is perceived positively. Also, it revealed variety between professions, indicating that a customized approach per profession group might contribute to successful implementation of safety strategies. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the psychosocial correlates of attachment in adolescents living in a rural area during pregnancy and early motherhood. Early exchanges between the mother and her infant provide a positive foundation on which to build relationships across the lifespan. The aims of this research is twofold. Firstly, problems in attachment have been proposed to have an important causative role in childhood delay and problems in emotional, social and intellectual development. Secondly, postnatal depression in mothers is known to be associated with problems of attachment and social support. One hundred and twenty two consenting pregnant adolescents attending a public based <b>midwifery</b> antenatal <b>clinic</b> in a rural health service area in south west New South Wales participated in a correlational study. One hundred and thirteen adolescent mothers were reinterviewed at 6 weeks and 6 - 12 months after the birth of the baby. A demographic questionnaire and six objective research instruments were employed to measure the main variables of attachment, self esteem, social support and postnatal depression. i) The Maternal-Foetal Attachment Scale, ii) Prenatal Attachment Inventory, iii) The Support Behaviours Inventory, iv) Rosenberg 2 ̆ 7 s Self Esteem Scale. During motherhood: v) How I Feel About My Baby Now Scale, vi) Maternal Attachment Inventory vii) Parenting Sense of Competence Scale, viii) Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and ix) Facilitators and Regulators Questionnaire. Qualitative data was collected exploring the mother 2 ̆ 7 s relationship with her foetus and her infant. The results indicated that maternal-foetal attachment was significantly related to the amount and quality of social support. Higher maternal-infant attachment scores were associated with self esteem at 6 - 12 months after the birth of the baby and to greater social support. High maternal-infant attachment was associated with positive parenting sense of competence and high self esteem at 6 weeks and 6 - 12 months during motherhood. Lower maternal-infant attachment was associated with those adolescents suggestive of the symptoms of postnatal depression at 6 weeks and 6 - 12 months after the birth of the baby. Self esteem decreased as the symptoms suggestive of postnatal depression increased at 6 weeks and 6 - 12 months. This study found that self esteem, social support and postnatal depression were the main variables impacting on attachment In adolescents during pregnancy and early motherhood. The quality of support and number of people perceived supportive by the adolescent influences greater attachment behaviours in pregnancy. High self -esteem influenced greater attachment behaviours at 6 - 12 months after the birth of the baby but not at 6 weeks after delivery. Positive parenting sense of competence was associated with high maternal-infant attachment and higher self esteem at 6 weeks and 6 - 12 months during motherhood. Symptoms suggestive of postnatal depression were associated with lower attachment scores and lower self esteem. Maternal-foetal attachment in pregnant adolescents was not associated with maternal-infant attachment in adolescent mothers at 6 weeks or 6 - 12 months. This study alerts us to the issues faced by pregnant adolescents and adolescent mothers living in a rural area in relation to attachment. Of concern is the high rate of symptoms suggestive of postnatal depression which may influence attachment. It is essential that midwives and health professionals provide a family centred approach, actively involving not only the pregnant adolescent and adolescent mother but also the family where possible. This in turn may reduce the risk of postnatal depression and its potential impact on maternal-infant attachment. A significant finding not directly associated with the hypotheses of this study relate to the high rate of older partners, conflict relationships and domestic violence. This issue is a cause for concern and midwives need to be vigilant for indicators of domestic violence...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Unwanted pregnancies {{are one of}} {{the major}} {{problems}} in developing countries. This research aimed to answer the question whether women with unwanted pregnancies seek the health care they need. Methods: In this descriptive-analytical study, 270 pregnant women referring to Shahroud hospitals to terminate their pregnancies were studied through the census method and were divided into two groups of wanted and unwanted pregnancies. A self questionnaire was used to collect data and it was completed through personal interviews and referring to mothers’ health files. The data were analyzed via Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U test. Results: The results of the study showed significant differences between pre-pregnancy counseling, the number of referrals to the clinic, the time of folic acid consumption, regular consumption of iron tablets, routine pregnancy testing and optimal weight gain between the two groups of wanted and unwanted pregnancy (P> 0. 05). Mann Whitney U test showed {{a significant difference between the}} mean time of first visit for prenatal care (P= 0. 004), and the average number of referrals to <b>midwifery</b> <b>clinic</b> in wanted and unwanted pregnancies (P= 0. 003).

40|$|We {{investigated}} ultrasound education {{received by}} 337 midwives who actually perform ultrasound examination in institutions with a <b>midwifery</b> <b>clinic</b> or midwifery centers with beds, and obtained the following results. 1) Of the 337 midwives, 63. 5 % received ultrasound education before performing ultrasound examination. The site {{that provided the}} education was the hospital where they work in 70. 1 %, and the instructor was a physician in 76. 6 %. 2) The median total pre-service education time was 18. 5 hours, and only 8. 5 % of them considered the education time to be adequate. 3) Slightly less than 30 % of the midwives considered that their ultrasound findings were accurate. The median number of ultrasound examinations they performed until they gained confidence in the accuracy of their findings was 30 in the group with and 50 in the group without pre-service education. The former group showed {{a higher percentage of}} midwives considering that their ultrasound findings were accurate, and also gained confidence in accuracy after fewer examinations than the latter group. 4) The educational contents more than 50 % of the midwives received were observing the method to operate ultrasound equipment and training in this method, and the contents more than 50 % considered to be important were basic knowledge of ultrasound (lectures on the purpose/advantages of ultrasound, and those on the gestational periods for ultrasound examination/diagnostic points according to the gestational period), the method to operate ultrasound equipment (lectures and training), imaging diagnosis (lectures/study by observation/training), and coping methods when they detect deviations from normal. Thus, OJT in the hospital where each midwife works contributed to the education of midwives performing ultrasound examination, and the group who received pre-service education had more confidence in the accuracy of their ultrasound findings compared with the group not receiving this education. These results suggest the necessity of systematic education in ultrasound before and during actually providing the service...|$|E
