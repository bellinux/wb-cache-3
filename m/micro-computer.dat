500|$|Khan's {{suit was}} made of {{reinforced}} latex, coloured steel-blue and fitted with <b>micro-computer</b> circuitry. Rampal's suit {{was made of}} three-inch thick solid rubber, and was red in color. Both actors were required to wear additional suits inside their body suits to prevent skin contact. Wearing the suits created a number of difficulties for the actors. It took 20 minutes {{to put on the}} suits and 40 minutes to remove them. In addition, the non-porous nature of the suits created intense heat inside, causing excessive perspiration despite the presence of special air conditioning ducts. Khan later felt that the suits' conception had been a mistake since filming occurred during the day; digital adjustments to the suits brought [...] "all the efforts to naught." ...|$|E

40|$|The actual {{trend in}} the {{transport}} industry is to have electronic systems without mechanical back-up, so-called "bywire " systems. <b>Micro-computers</b> control steering, brakes, power train etc [...] . Robust protocols are needed to make these <b>micro-computers</b> communicate. They should be faulttolerant and yet not let the <b>micro-computers</b> split into disjoint communicating subsets.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the use of microcomputers at the undergraduate level in college-based nursing programs in 15 Southern states. Data from a regional survey administered by the Southern Regional Education Board in 1985 as part of the three-year Nursing Special Project Grant (D 10 NU 24198) were used to examine differences, if any, in uses of <b>micro-computers</b> in associate and baccalaureate degree nursing education programs. The findings indicated the programs used microcomputers as a tool to support learning more frequently than as an instructional delivery system in the nursing curriculum.

This paper discusses the various functions of easy-to-use inventory management software for <b>micro-computers.</b> From our experience in implementing these systems in wholesale companies, retail companies and spare-part warehouses we will report on •the link between the inventory management system and the accounting system; •how operations research and inventory models can be applied; •when statistical forecasting is useful and when it is not useful; •the behaviour and the reaction of the software user. We also describe a simple approach to assess the potential ordering, stockholding and stockout cost savings and the service improvement due to scientific inventory control...|$|R
40|$|In most {{developing}} countries, {{the number}} of <b>micro-computers</b> in use {{in the field is}} still very small. For example, only 10 - 15 micros are in use in district administration in India, whereas each of the 30 departments in the 412 districts in India could profitably use one. Since the expenditure on rural development programmes in India is large, pay off from using computers can be immense. The paper draws upon work done at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIMA) to emphasize the need to provide access to <b>micro-computers</b> at the district level. In addition to large cost savings, there would be other benefits, such as improved quality of data, capability for spatial and model based analysis, and good monitoring and control. ...|$|R
