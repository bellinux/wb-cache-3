50|$|<b>Candied</b> <b>sugar</b> has {{its origins}} in Iran.

The sugar solution was colored with cochineal and indigo and scented with ambergris or flower essence.|$|R

5000|$|Jellies and gums:Jellies and gums are thick liquid <b>sugar</b> <b>candies.</b> [...] Gums, such as wine gums, are drier than jellies. They {{are made}} from sugar syrup plus a gelling agent. They are cooked to the lowest {{temperature}} <b>of</b> all <b>sugar</b> <b>candies</b> and consequently have the highest water content <b>of</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>candies,</b> about 20 to 25% water. Their stiffness depends on the type and amount of gelling agent, the final concentration, the pH of the product, and other factors. The most popular forms of gelling agent are gelatin, agar-agar, starch (more typical <b>of</b> American jelly <b>candies),</b> and pectin (more typical <b>of</b> European <b>candies).</b> These produce different effects. For example, starch produces cloudy jellies, while high-methoxyl pectin produces clear ones. Agar-based jellies are harder to dissolve, and gelatin-based jellies have a more rubbery texture.|$|R

50|$|Decision fatigue can {{influence}} irrational impulse purchases at supermarkets. During {{a trip to}} the supermarket, trade-off decisions regarding prices and promotions can produce decision fatigue, hence by the time the shopper reaches the cash register, less willpower remains to resist impulse purchases <b>of</b> <b>candy</b> and <b>sugared</b> items. Sweet snacks are usually featured at the cash register because many shoppers have decision fatigue {{by the time they get}} there. Florida State University social psychologist Roy Baumeister has also found that it is directly tied to low glucose levels, and that replenishing them restores the ability to make effective decisions. This has been offered as an explanation for why poor shoppers are more likely to eat during their trips.|$|R

50|$|In a {{study of}} {{approximately}} 8,000 individuals, candy consumers enjoyed an average of 0.92 years of longer life, with greater consumption <b>of</b> <b>candy</b> not associated with progressively lower mortality.

Mortality was lowest among those consuming candy 1-3 times a month and highest among those consuming candy three or more times a week. The study concluded that one possible explanation for this was the presence of antioxidant phenols in chocolate, but the study could not differentiate between consumption <b>of</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>candy</b> and chocolate in they study.|$|R

40|$|Sugar {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{protected}} agricultural commodities in the United States and other countries around the world through the use of production allotments, preferential marketing agreements, and tariffs. These protectionist measures lead to increased input costs for <b>manufacturers</b> <b>of</b> <b>candies</b> and soft drinks. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has in part altered the nature of sugar trade throughout the North American continent. This paper presents a game theoretical Cournot model which illustrates how trade in sugar containing products and the location of sugar containing product manufacturers in North America is likely to be impacted by the combined effects of U. S. sugar policy and NAFTA. Current international agreements which affect sugar confectioners are incorporated in the Cournot model such as NAFTA along with U. S. and Mexican re-export programs. Preliminary results indicate that domestic firms are at a cost disadvantage to firms that export into the domestic market due to current international agreements and domestic policy. Furthermore, due to the nature of policy in Canada, Mexico and the U. S., firms are implicitly given an incentive to locate in another country and export to Mexico or the U. S. The nature of current policy affects the amount of sugar trade between North American countries as firms seek to gain an advantage in the cost of inputs as well as the volume of finished goods traded between countries.

5000|$|The final texture <b>of</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>candy</b> depends {{primarily}} on the sugar concentration. As the syrup is heated, it boils, water evaporates, the sugar concentration increases and the boiling point rises. A given temperature corresponds to a particular sugar concentration. These are called sugar stages. In general, higher temperatures and greater sugar concentrations result in hard, brittle candies, and lower temperatures result in softer candies. [...] Once the syrup reaches [...] or higher, the sucrose molecules break down into many simpler sugars, creating an amber-colored substance known as caramel. This {{should not be confused}} with caramel candy, although it is the candy's main flavoring.|$|R
