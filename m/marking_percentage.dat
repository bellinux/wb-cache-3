Tetracycline drugs and DC Ar administered in the diet successfully marked laboratory-cultured mosquitofish, but exposure to direct sunlight in outdoor tanks resulted in the rapid disappearance of the marks.

40|$|Introduction: Intercalation has {{significant}} costs and {{students need to}} balance these with information about potential benefit. Thus this study sought to identify whether undertaking an intercalated degree impacted upon exam performance in the primary medical qualification. Methods: Retrospective case-matched data analyses of anonymised student databases from the University of Birmingham Medical School. 171 students who intercalated, were matched for MBChB performance with students from the same cohort who did not intercalate. Individual student change in overall year <b>mark</b> (<b>percentage),</b> between two consecutive years of the MBChB, was compared between groups. Results: There {{was a significant difference}} (t(170) = 4. 095, p< 0. 001) in change in mark in the intercalation group (mean improvement = 4. 48, SD = 6. 16) compared with the non-intercalation group (mean improvement = 2. 11, SD = 5. 04). Intercalation within the home institution, earlier in the MBChB degree and female gender also had positive effects on change in mark. Conclusion: Students from the University of Birmingham who undertook an intercalated degree demonstrated significant improvements in academic performance. This finding supports evidence from other single institution studies and confirms positive impact of intercalation. Threats to financial support for intercalated degrees may therefore be detrimental in the education of tomorrow’s doctors...|$|R
40|$|The European Stroke Prevention Study was a multicenter trial {{comparing}} {{the effect of}} a combination of 75 mg dipyridamole and 33 mg acetylsalicylic acid tid with placebo in the prevention of stroke or death after one or more attacks of recent transient ischemic attack or stroke of atherothrombotic origin. From the 2, 500 patients in the intention-to-treat analysis, the proportion of women was 42 %, and from the 1, 861 patients in the explanatory analysis it was 44 %. The endpoint incidence was significantly higher in men than in women. The endpoint reduction was statistically significant in men in both types of analyses with total endpoints (stroke or death) and in the risk of stroke, while in women it was statistically significant only in the intention-to-treat analysis with total endpoints. However, there was a <b>marked</b> <b>percentage</b> reduction of endpoints in both men and women in explanatory analysis. The risk reduction of strokes was 49 % for men and 41 % for women, and the reduction of total endpoints was 39 % in men and 30 %nt; in women.

40|$|Lifetime Ewe Management is an {{extension}} program designed to assist sheep producers to improve their understanding of ewe nutrition and to develop the skills and confidence to improve their management. The course {{is based on a}} small-group extension model and was developed by the Lifetimewool project as a way to incorporate the research findings, economic modelling and producer guidelines developed by the project. Lifetime Ewe Management commenced in Victoria in the spring of 2006 {{and by the end of}} 2010, 221 producers had completed the 2 -year program. The changes in knowledge, attitudes, skills, aspirations and management practices of 182 of these participants were examined. Participants of the Lifetime Ewe Management program increased their whole-farm stocking rates by 14 %, increased lamb <b>marking</b> <b>percentages</b> by 1113 % depending on enterprise type, and decreased ewe mortality rates by 43 %. These improvements resulted from a significant change in the perceived importance of managing ewes to condition-score targets to improve profitability and increases in the ability of participants to condition score ewes, assess pasture quantity and quality and feed budget. These changes were consistent regardless of how innovative the participants were at the beginning of the program. The appeal and success of the program was attributed largely to the small-group model where producers worked with their own flock under the guidance of a skilled facilitator and with access to effective decision-making tools. The Lifetime Ewe Management program design provides a blueprint for future extension programs striving to achieve widespread practice change...|$|R
