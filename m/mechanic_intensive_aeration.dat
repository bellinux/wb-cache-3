40|$|The quick {{recovery}} process of contaminants removal of aerobic granular sludge (AGS) is complex, and the influencing factors {{are still not}} clear. The effects of dissolved oxygen (DO, air <b>intensive</b> <b>aeration</b> rate), organic loading rate (OLR), and C/N on contaminants removal characteristics of AGS and subsequently long-term operation of AGS bioreactor were investigated in this study. DO had {{a major impact on}} the recovery of AGS. The granules reactivated at air <b>intensive</b> <b>aeration</b> rate of 100 [*]L/h achieved better settling property and contaminants removal efficiency. Moreover, protein content in extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) was almost unchanged, which demonstrated that an aeration rate of 100 [*]L/h was more suitable for maintaining the biomass and the structure of AGS. Higher OLR caused polysaccharides content increase in EPS, and unstable C/N resulted in the overgrowth of filamentous bacteria, which presented worse NH 4 +-N and PO 43 −-P removal. Correspondingly, quick recovery of contaminants removal was accomplished in 12 days at the optimized operation conditions of aeration rate 100 [*]L/h, OLR 4 [*]g/L·d, and C/N 100 [*]:[*] 10, with COD, NH 4 +-N, and PO 43 −-P removal efficiencies of 87. 2 %, 86. 9 %, and 86. 5 %, respectively.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to show wether the sewer system in front of a wastewater treatment plant might be used as an additional pretreatment process stage. The investigations were carried out on a pilot plant consisting of 450 m of sewer (DN 100) with a subsequent grit chamber and a primary clarifier. To enhance the biomass concentration within the investigated sewer system recycled sludge from the primary clarifier was added at different points and in different concentrations. The results show that for an efficient removal of wastewater constituents within the sewer system the oxygen concentration in the wastewater is the critical parameter. At low oxygen concentrations up to 0. 1 mg/l a considerable amount of substances from the recycled sludge dissolve into the wastewater, thereby almost completely covering the scarce aerobic biodegradation. <b>Intensive</b> <b>aeration</b> of the atmosphere of the sewer didn't improve the situation. The addition of chemically bound oxygen in form of nitrate (recycled from the aerobic reactor of the respective wastewater treatment plant) is biochemically appropriate, as denitrification experiments show, but its application is hindered by the hydraulic limits of the sewer system. <b>Intensive</b> <b>aeration</b> by adding aeration devices to the sewer system at an equal distance of 50 meters showed only little improvement of removal rates. The use of the sewer system as a preceding process stage basically is possible, but several aspects considerably hinder its technical application: the aeration of a reactor which has a hight of only few decimeters; the need of expensive and difficult open and closed loop control technique; the necessity of putting out of operation during storm water discharge; a very low reactor volume and a very low retention time.

In current net pen aquaculture operations (Minnesota Aquafarms, Inc.), metabolic wastes and uneaten food are dispersed into the lakewater. Intensive aquaculture at Twin City-South and Sherman increased levels of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) and reduced dissolved oxygen (DO) in the water column, and increased the deposition of organic matter to the bottom relative to their previous conditions and to unused mine pit lakes. Numerous trophic status indices suggest that TC-S and Sherman have shifted (or are shifting) from an oligotrophic state to a more eutrophic one.

40|$|This master thesis {{focuses on}} the effect of {{cultivation}} parameters on hyaluronic acid synthesis during its biotechnological production. The cultivation parameters were temperature of the cultivation, aeration, agitation, carbon source and addition of phosphatidylcholine. Changes in molecular weight and yield of hyaluronic acid, growth of biomass and medium viscosity were observed. From the obtained data we learned, that the specific growth rate greatly impacts final characteristics of hyaluronic acid. Under suboptimal temperatures a high molecular weight polymer was synthesised along with comparable yields from the control cultivation. High temperatures (40 °C) caused a dip in molecular weight. The next cultivation parameters were aeration and agitation. The highest molecular weights were obtained in cultivations with high agitation rates and <b>intensive</b> <b>aeration,</b> specifically 1 vvm/ 800 rpm and 2 vvm/ 800 rpm. Agitation had a bigger influence on molecular weight than aeration. When the carbon source was changed from sucrose to glucose, the lowest molecular weight and yield were obtained.

40|$|International audienceThe {{glycerol}} fermentation by Klebsiella pneumoniae occurs by receiving {{more than five}} liquid products-organic acids, diols, and ethanol. Aiming to direct the glycerol conversion towards predominant production of 2, 3 -butanediol (2, 3 -BD), the main influencing parameters (the aeration and the pH) were investigated during fed-batch processes. The regime of <b>intensive</b> <b>aeration</b> (2. 2 vvm air supply) was evaluated as most favorable for 2, 3 -BD synthesis and ensured the decrease of all other metabolites. Thus, without pH control, 52. 5 g/l 2, 3 -BD were produced, as the carbon conversion of glycerol into 2, 3 -BD reached 60. 6 %. Additional enhancement in 2, 3 -BD production (by significant increase of glycerol utilization) was achieved {{by the development of}} a new method of "forced pH fluctuations". It was realized by consecutive raisings of pH using definite DeltapH value, at exact time intervals, allowing multiple variations. Thus, the optimal conditions for maximal glycerol consumption were defined, and 70 g/l 2, 3 -BD were produced, which is the highest amount obtained from glycerol as a sole carbon source until now.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} effect of {{hydrogen}} peroxide on vaginal microbial communities. Strus M, Brzychczy-Wloch M, Gosiewski T, Kochan P, Heczko PB. Jagiellonian University Medical College, Cracow, Poland. This study presents {{a series of}} experiments carried out in order to elucidate the role of H 2 O 2 in antimicrobial activity of lactobacilli. Vaginal swabs were collected from 60 premenopausal women and checked for pH and Nugent score, and Lactobacillus species were cultured, phenotyped and genotyped. The main outcome measures involved: (1) species of vaginal lactobacilli most effective in liberating H 2 O 2, (2) minimal microbicidal concentrations of added H 2 O 2, (3) kinetics of H 2 O 2 liberation in relation to oxygen tension, (4) antimicrobial activity of pure H 2 O 2 versus one produced by selected vaginal lactobacilli and the total activity of their culture supernatants. Results showed that H 2 O 2 was liberated especially by: Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus johnsonii and L. gasseri. Hydrogen peroxide reached concentrations from 0. 05 to 1. 0 mM, which under <b>intensive</b> <b>aeration</b> increased even up to 1. 8 mM. Microorganisms related to vaginal pathologies show varied resistance to the action of pure H 2 O 2. Most potent inhibitory activity against bacteria and yeasts was presented by Lactobacillus culture supernate producing H 2 O 2, followed by the nonproducing strain and pure H 2 O 2.

40|$|On {{example of}} the model field system we {{demonstrate}} that quantum fluctuations of non-abelian gauge fields leading to radiative corrections to Higgs potential and spontaneous symmetry breaking can generate order region in phase space of inherently chaotic classical field system. We demonstrate on the example of another model field system that quantum fluctuations do not influence on the chaotic dynamics of nonabelian Yang–Mills fields if the ratio of bare coupling constants of Yang–Mills and Higgs fields is larger then some critical value. This critical value is estimated. A steady interest to chaos in gauge field theories (GFT) [3] is connected with the facts that all four fundamental particle interactions have chaotic solutions [9].

40|$|The precise {{assessment}} of respiratory <b>mechanics</b> in <b>intensive</b> care unit (ICU) patients can potentially {{be of great}} benefit to their management. Some commercial ventilators now offer methods for determining values for lung compliance and resistance at a single frequency, however ongoing research in animals has shown that much more valuable information can be extracted from {{an analysis of the}} mechanical input impedance spectrum over a range of frequencies. To do this, it is essential to be able to control the characteristics of the input flow waveform into the lungs (i. e. frequency and amplitude). A new type of mechanical ventilator that measures respiratory impedance over a broad frequency range has been designed and built. It allows for simultaneous application of different ventilatory modes. The design has overcome some of the problems associated with the current experimental systems, {{such as the use of}} flow transducers between the patient and the flow source, or the temporary disconnection of the patient during the application of forced oscillations in flow. Generation of flow oscillations is based around a vane that rotates inside a semi-circular housing. The computer-controlled vane can generate volume displacements as low as 20 ml for frequencies from 0. 5 to 10 Hz. The new ventilator may serve as a flexible research tool for mechanics studies in ICU patients, and ultimately as a device for routine {{assessment of}} respiratory mechanical status...|$|R
40|$|Aeration {{and rapid}} sand {{filtration}} are common {{practice for the}} treatment of iron, manganese and ammonium containing ground water for more than a century. Nevertheless, this process has not become obsolete. On the contrary, this thesis assumes that enhanced rapid sand filters remain standard treatment technology in the 21 st-century. Iron can be removed by homogeneous, heterogeneous and biological oxidation. The potential advantages of heterogeneous iron oxidation over homogeneous iron removal are high filtration rates, excellent iron removal and reduced losses of backwash water as demonstrated by the excellent performance of the pre-filters of water treatment plant Grobbendonk. Heterogeneous iron oxidation dominates at Grobbendonk because the supernatant is slightly anoxic and the pH is low. Thus adsorption and oxidation occur simultaneously. The target feed water in this thesis is deep anoxic ground water, characterized by high iron and methane concentrations. The typical high methane values demand <b>intensive</b> <b>aeration</b> to prevent excessive formation of mucus or slime by methanotrophic bacteria. This research focuses therefore on heterogeneous iron oxidation that can be applied by running an adsorptive filter under anoxic conditions and regenerate it intermittently under oxic conditions. In other words, adsorption and oxidation are separated in time. This work consists of three main parts: characterization of filter medium, batch experiments and pilot plant experiments. Sequential extraction provided useful information about the accumulation on filter medium grains. The accumulation on sand/anthracite grains of the two investigated production sites contained predominantly iron(hydr) oxides e. g. ferrihydrite, which was in agreement with literature. A method was developed to determine Freundlich isotherms constants that describe the adsorption of iron or manganese on filter medium of water treatment plants Holten and Spannenburg. These Freundlich isotherms allowed a rough estimation of the maximum operating time of a rapid sand filter in intermittent regeneration mode, which amounted to 189 bed volumes. Pilot plant research was initiated following up on these positive results. The pilot plant consisted of two columns. The first column was filled with iron-coated sand of Holten as an adsorbent. The aim of the experiments was to determine the optimal regeneration time and the influence of the Empty-Bed Contact Time (EBCT). An increase of the EBCT, e. g. a reduction of flow rate, resulted in an increase of the iron removal. Nevertheless, the performance was lower than estimated from the batch experiments. The explanations are: 1) there was no sharp-edged adsorption front, 2) calcium adsorption competed with iron adsorption. The absence of a sharp-edged adsorption indicates that kinetic limitations play an important role. Furthermore, a salt spiking experiment showed that the filter column did not show ideal plug flow reactor behavior. The anoxic process requires a considerable amount of oxic water for its regeneration. Oxic water beyond that to oxidize adsorbed iron(II) was necessary to expel methane. The slow start-up with virgin sand is an additional drawback, because it results in high water losses. However, a start-up with iron-coated sand is, of course, an option to be further investigated. The second filter column was filled with virgin sand and then used to determine the time that the process requires to get going, i. e. the startup time. It took more than 123 cycles, which implies a water loss of 3295 bed volumes, before iron became significantly removed. The research proved that a conventional oxic filter with aerators performs better than an anoxic filter in intermittent mode. With equal iron removal efficiencies, the number of bed volumes that can be treated and the accumulated iron load of a conventional filter are much higher. It is plausible that the anoxic pilot plant performs better at an even lower EBCT. However, this comes at the expense of one of the potential advantages of heterogeneous iron oxidation, a high filtration rate. Therefore, the outcome of this thesis does not yet warrant a change of the process configuration. When we furthermore compare the outcome of the pilot plant experiments with the performance of the pre-filters of Grobbendonk, we have to conclude that heterogeneous iron removal performs better when adsorption and oxidation occur simultaneously, instead of separated in time.

In the patients with acute left ventricular failure, the Zrs abnormalities noted were an excessive frequency dependence of resistance from 10 to 20 Hz and an abnormally low reactance at all frequencies, abnormalities qualitatively similar to those observed in the asthmatic patients but of lesser magnitude.

40|$|Submerged {{membrane}} bioreactor (MBR) processes for treating municipal or industrial wastewater {{are one of}} the most promising applications of microfiltration membranes. Previous studies were spread over various fields of research including water science, microbiology, chemical engineering, material science and process control. All of the above research societies contributed comprehensively to a further improvement of the technology. Nevertheless, it is known that higher operational expenses compared to conventional water treatment strategies weaken the competitiveness of MBRs. More precisely, recent energy efficiency analyses identified the coarse bubble aeration of the membrane unit to consume the biggest proportion of the overall energy input. Therefore, hydrodynamic conditions in submerged microfiltration processes were investigated experimentally and numerically on three different scales in the framework of this study. The overall objective was to evaluate the impact of operating parameters, feed characteristics and module design features on the efficiency of air bubbling to control cake layer formation. On a micro-scale, local phenomena such as permeate flow, particle deposition and cake removal were non-invasively visualised with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging. Complementary filtration experiments were conducted by applying a number of test facilities equipped with single hollow-fibres (meso-scale) or single hollow-fibre bundles (macro-scale) in different modes of operation. The bubble-induced fibre movement as a key parameter affecting the overall process performance was tracked with a direct observation (DO) technique (meso-scale). A macroscopic computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach based on X-ray computer tomography (CT) scans and calibrated with numerical pressure loss correlations was established. The investigations have shown the impact of lumen-side pressure losses on the distribution of local permeate flux. Cake formation appeared to be heterogeneous, with thicker cakes close to the point of permeate extraction. The cake growth was in good agreement with the fouling rate dTMP/dt as a function of permeate flux, solids concentration and aeration conditions. Cake layer removal was enhanced with an increase in net aeration rate, bubble-induced fibre movement and background circulation flow. Interestingly, a higher aeration frequency for the same net aeration rate and an optimal gross aeration rate were observed, which outlines potentials for reducing aeration requirements. Fibre motion was more <b>intensive</b> for higher <b>aeration</b> rates, but insensitive to packing density variations. The CFD results were indicating a clear impact of fibre arrangement, superficial inlet velocity and solids concentration on the local cross-flow velocity and turbulence intensity. A well-defined slug flow was observed before the Taylor bubble penetrates into the porous medium. Moving forward, different module configurations will be evaluated with CFD, thus providing insights into the complex multi-phase flow pattern which are not accessible with experimental observation techniques...|$|R
