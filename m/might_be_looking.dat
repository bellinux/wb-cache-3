Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require simply {{enormous amounts of}} information about the world: the program needs to have some idea of what it <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> at or what it is talking about. This requires that the program know most of the same things about the world that a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was a truly vast amount of information. No one in 1970 could build a database so large and no one knew how a program might learn so much information.|$|E

Hardawar {{noted that the}} {{major changes in the}} release focus on features rather than the visual interface. He wrote that the lock screen is now [...] "far more customizable than before". He praised the new features added to 3D Touch, writing that it [...] "finally feels useful", where he likes that [...] "3D Touch works in almost every part of the OS". In regard to iMessage, he wrote that it has new features that are [...] "particularly useful", including [...] "Invisible ink" [...] that obscures text in a conversation when others <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking,</b> but criticized the user interface, writing that it [...] "needs some work". The [...] "Memories" [...] feature in the new Photos app [...] "usually turned out well", but wrote that [...] "they're still clearly a work in progress". Hardawar praised the new Apple Music app, but added that [...] "really, anything is better than the last iteration". He also liked lyrics support. He wrote that Siri's third-party support was [...] "actually starting to get useful", but did run into accuracy issues. He finished by writing that although iOS 10 does add features seen in Google's Android operating system before, the mobile industry is [...] "shamelessly getting [...] "inspired" [...] by the competition". His summary states that [...] "iOS 10 is a collection of useful changes to an already solid OS".|$|E

[...] A boot's primary function is to transfer the rider's energy into the board, protect the rider with support, and keep the rider's feet warm. A snowboarder shopping for boots is usually {{looking for a good}} fit, flex, and looks. Boots can have different features such as lacing styles, heat molding liners, and gel padding that the snowboarder also <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> for. Tradeoffs include rigidity versus comfort, and built in forward lean, versus comfort.|$|E

Instead, they gave their blessing to the notion of gamers [...] "inherit the storyline", and The Matrix Online video game was billed as the official continuation. In February 2015, in interviews promoting Jupiter Ascending, Lilly Wachowski called a return to The Matrix a [...] "particularly repelling idea in these times", noting the studios' tendency to green-light sequels, reboots and adaptations over original material, while Lana Wachowski, addressing rumors about whether {{there was going to be}} a reboot, said that they haven't heard anything, but she believed the studio <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> to replace them.|$|E
2500|$|The often-delayed {{plan for}} British and Vermont representatives finally {{took place in}} May 1781. [...] The details of this meeting, which ran from May 7 to 25 and {{took place at the}} British fort on Ile-aux-Noix, are {{primarily}} recounted from the writings of Justus Sherwood. [...] He found Ira Allen, the principal negotiator for Vermont to be evasive and extremely wary. [...] Allen refused to sign any sort of preliminary agreement, claiming that, although Vermont's leaders were disposed toward the idea, the populace was not, and {{it would have to be}} convinced first. [...] On May 11, Sherwood wrote, [...] "My opinion corroborates with the Major's that Mr. Allen's errand here is to prolong the time and if possible to alarm Congress into a compliance with their demands." [...] He also felt that Vermont's large landowners (which included the Allens and Chittenden) <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> more to their own interests than to those of the people of Vermont. [...] The meeting ended with an oral agreement in which the British promised to not conduct further hostilities against Vermont, while the Vermont authorities would prepare the people for reunion, and try to convince the assembly to appoint commissioners to negotiate an alliance when it met in June.|$|E

2500|$|Cunningham {{became a}} short-list {{candidate}} for the cabinet of Governor Ed Rendell. Initial discussions centered around the secretary position for the Department of Community and Economic Development. In December 2002, Cunningham cut short his trip to a National League of Cities conference in Salt Lake City to fly to Philadelphia and discuss the post with Rendell. Cunningham and Rendell had previously met through the Pennsylvania League of Cities and Municipalities, {{near the end of}} Rendell's tenure as mayor of Philadelphia, and they had been friends since. Rendell said economic development of the state's urban core was one of the top issues of his administration, and that he had [...] "tremendous respect" [...] for Cunningham and his accomplishments in Bethlehem. Likewise, Cunningham said he had modeled his administration's economic development plan for Bethlehem in part after the prototype Rendell used as mayor of Philadelphia. In January 2003, it was announced Rendell had tapped Cunningham for a secretary position, but with the Department of General Services, not the Department of Community and Economic Development. Although Cunningham was a candidate for both posts, Rendell said his track record of success in Bethlehem despite the loss of Bethlehem Steel would serve him well in maintaining the state's costs. Rendell also said Cunningham would be in the forefront of an effort to contain spending in the state government, which was facing a $2 billion budget deficit. Rendell said of Cunningham: [...] "You <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> at the only two people in Pennsylvania who know how to cut costs." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{one looks}} into a palantír, one can mentally {{communicate}} with other such stones {{and anyone who}} <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> into them; beings of great power can manipulate the greater stones to see virtually {{any part of the}} world. They were made by the Elves of Valinor in the Uttermost West, by the Noldor, possibly even [...] Fëanor himself. Many palantíri were made, but only eight are specifically mentioned in Tolkien's published works. Fashioned of a dark crystal, they were indestructible by any means men possessed {{at the end of the}} Third Age; it was suspected that the fire of Orodruin, Mount Doom, might be able to destroy them. They were of various sizes; the smallest had a diameter of about a foot (30cm), while the largest were much larger and could not be lifted by one man. Some, such as the Stones of Osgiliath and Amon Sul, had power over other stones including the ability to eavesdrop. [...] The smaller stones required one to move around them, thereby changing the viewpoint of its vision, whereas the larger stones could be turned on their axis. The Master Stone was kept in the tower of Avallónë on Tol Eressëa, but no record is made of successful communication from any palantír of Middle-earth to this one. A wielder of great power such as one of the Maiar like Sauron could dominate a weaker user through the stone, which was the experience of Peregrin Took and possibly Saruman. According to Gandalf, it is beyond the skill of both Sauron and Saruman to create the palantíri and that Sauron cannot make the palantíri [...] "lie", or create false images, though he could show selective images to create a false impression in the viewer.|$|E
