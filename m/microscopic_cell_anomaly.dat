The homogenized stress–strain relation in the cracked <b>microscopic</b> <b>cell</b> defines the degradation tensor, which can be obtained by the equivalence between the averaged strain energy of the <b>microscopic</b> <b>cell</b> and the strain energy density of the homogenized material.

Usually he will choose several prototypes for one class, but he cannot provide a good and large enough sample set for the class to train a classifier. Therefore, we mapped his technical procedure into a technical system based on proper theoretical methods that assist him in acquiring the knowledge about his application and furthermore in developing a classifier for his task. This system helps him to learn about the clusters and the borderlines of the clusters even when the data are very noisy as is the case for <b>microscopic</b> <b>cell</b> images in drug discovery, where it is unclear if the drug will produce the expected result on the cell parts. We describe in this paper the necessary functions that a prototype-based classifier should have.

40|$|The {{microtubule}} cytoskeleton plays {{a crucial}} role in the cell cycle and in mitosis. Colchicine is a microtubule-depolymerizing agent that has long been used to induce chromosome individualization in cells arrested at metaphase and also in the induction of polyploid plants. Although attempts have been made to explain the processes and mechanisms underlying polyploidy induction, the role of the cytoskeleton still remains largely unknown. Through immunodetection of alpha-tubulin, different concentrations (0. 5 or 5 mM) of colchicine were found to produce opposite effects in the organization of the cytoskeleton in rye (Secale cereale L.). A low concentration (0. 5 mM) induced depolymerization of the microtubular cytoskeleton in all phases of the cell cycle. In contrast, a high concentration (5 mM) was found to induce the polymerization of new tubulin-containing structures in c-metaphase cells. Furthermore, both treatments also showed contrasting effects in the induction of polyploid cells. Flow cytometric analysis and quantitative assessments of nucleolus-organizing regions revealed that only the high-concentration colchicine treatment was effective in the formation of polyploid cells. Our studies indicate that spindle disruption alone is insufficient for the induction of polyploid cells. The absence of any tubulin structures in plants treated with colchicine at the low concentration induced <b>cell</b> <b>anomalies,</b> such as the occurrence of nuclei with irregular shape and/or (additional) micronuclei, 12 h after recovery, pointing to a direct effect on cell viability.

40|$|Background: Cervical {{cancer is}} one of the ten most {{frequent}} cancers in Turkey. It is well known that cervical cancer morbidity and mortality could be significantly reduced with an active cervical smear screening (Pap smear) program. Aims: The aims of this study were: 1) to evaluate the knowledge and attitudes of women about cervical smear testing; 2) to establish a cervical smear screening program and to evaluate the cervical cytological abnormalities that were found; 3) to determine the applicability, limitations and effectiveness of this screening in a primary health care unit. Patients and Methods: A total of 332 married women were included in our study. We collected data concerning socio-demographic and fertility characteristics, and knowledge about Pap smear testing was determined through printed questionnaires. A gynecological examination and Pap smear screening was performed on every woman in our study group. Results: Over ninety percent of our study group had never heard of and had not undergone Pap smear screening before.
