They are accompanied by Parshya's maternal uncle Diwakar. On the first day Vichare is asked to sign the usual papers before admission in hospital. Upon asking, he learns that the papers say the doctor would not be responsible if anything goes wrong. Vichare, the rustic grandfather finds these terms unacceptable. A <b>medical</b> <b>social</b> <b>worker,</b> Aasawari, quickly comes in and explains the practice to Vichare. She calms him down and accompanies them during the first appointment with the doctor. Dr. Sane quickly diagnoses child {{as a victim of}} retinoblastoma — a rare retinal cancer. After consulting with other colleagues in US and UK doctor finds that only way to save child's life is to perform an operation that will leave the child blind. As per rule, doctor explains this and insists child be informed of this before surgery. He cannot be operated without this knowledge as it was against ethics. Aasawari (Amruta Subhash) who helps the doctor in convincing the grandfather and the grandson, tries to keep track of Vichare and persuades him not fall prey to other doctors promising false medicines. She tries to befriend Parshya to explain him what is going to happen. However, she finds it is too difficult to explain to him that he will turn blind.|$|E

The findings also suggested that <b>medical</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> rendered a great deal of counselling services to patients, particularly those in bereavement and marital conflicts. For patients with home care/discharge problems, referrals to community resources were more important than counselling. While the majority of patients were discharged from <b>medical</b> <b>social</b> services with follow-ups offered by <b>medical</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> and <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> of community services, 13 % of patients either lost contact or declined services from <b>medical</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers.</b> Recommendations for improving <b>medical</b> <b>social</b> services at AEDs are made. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|This thesis aims {{to explore}} how <b>medical</b> <b>social</b> workers/counselors perform their work with people during crisis and how they {{accumulate}} and practice scientific crisis knowledge. This study is an empirical research paper based on qualitative interviews conducted with eight <b>medical</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers.</b> The data was analysed with Kvales model for categorization, which constitutes {{the basis of the}} research. The results of the research was then analysed with the use of Cullbergs crisis theory and a model of evidence based practice which is described by Topor and Denhov.

The <b>medical</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> acknowledged the individuals’ experiences in their work as well as their own experiences and scientific knowledge. Our conclusion is that the practice of <b>medical</b> <b>social</b> workers/counselors is varying, depending on the varying needs of the individuals.
