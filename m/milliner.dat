2500|$|<b>Milliners</b> did {{not have}} a trade company of their own so they had to belong to other companies. Only Mosley and one other woman were {{recorded}} in the Clockmakers' records as <b>milliners</b> among the female members of the company, although it is highly likely other women were also <b>milliners.</b> Some companies did continue to specify which trade could be practiced by their members and among those more <b>milliners</b> are found. Although female membership in the companies accounted for only one to two percent of the total membership, a significant number of them were <b>milliners.</b> In the Haberdashers' Company nearly half of the girls apprenticed {{in the first half of}} the eighteenth century were apprenticed to <b>milliners.</b> [...] In the Grocers' Company, two-thirds of the girls apprenticed between 1717 and 1743 were to <b>milliners.</b> [...] In the Clothworkers' Company, of the eighty apprenticeships where the trade was noted, 25 were to <b>milliners.</b>|$|R
