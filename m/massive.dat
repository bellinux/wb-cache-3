5|$|Early {{in their}} development, T Tauri stars follow the Hayashi track—they {{contract}} and decrease in luminosity while remaining {{at roughly the}} same temperature. Less <b>massive</b> T Tauri stars follow this track to the main sequence, while more <b>massive</b> stars turn onto the Henyey track.|$|E

5|$|Several {{globular}} clusters (like M15) have extremely <b>massive</b> cores which may harbor black holes, although simulations {{suggest that a}} less <b>massive</b> black hole or central concentration of neutron stars or <b>massive</b> white dwarfs explain observations equally well.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of a <b>massive</b> companion brings many other possibilities. If Eta Carinae A was rapidly stripped of its outer layers, {{it might be a}} less <b>massive</b> WC- or WO-type star when core collapse was reached. This would result in a type Ib or type Ic supernova {{due to the lack of}} hydrogen and possibly helium. This supernova type is thought to be the originator of certain classes of gamma ray bursts, but models predict they occur only normally in less <b>massive</b> stars.|$|E
5|$|The moons of Jupiter {{are listed}} below by orbital period. Moons <b>massive</b> enough for their {{surfaces}} to have collapsed into a spheroid are highlighted in bold. These are the four Galilean moons, which are comparable {{in size to}} the Moon. The four inner moons are much smaller, the fourth most <b>massive</b> being more than 7000 times more <b>massive</b> than the fifth-most. The irregular captured moons are shaded light gray when prograde and dark gray when retrograde.|$|E
5|$|The more <b>massive</b> the star, {{the shorter}} its lifespan, {{primarily}} because <b>massive</b> stars have greater pressure on their cores, {{causing them to}} burn hydrogen more rapidly. The most <b>massive</b> stars last an average of a few million years, while stars of minimum mass (red dwarfs) burn their fuel very slowly and can last tens to {{hundreds of billions of}} years.|$|E

5|$|A {{much larger}} star, however, is <b>massive</b> {{enough to create}} {{temperatures}} and pressures needed to cause the carbon in the core to begin to fuse when the star contracts {{at the end of}} the helium-burning stage. The cores of these <b>massive</b> stars become layered like onions as progressively heavier atomic nuclei build up at the center, with an outermost layer of hydrogen gas, surrounding a layer of hydrogen fusing into helium, surrounding a layer of helium fusing into carbon via the triple-alpha process, surrounding layers that fuse to progressively heavier elements. As a star this <b>massive</b> evolves, it undergoes repeated stages where fusion in the core stops, and the core collapses until the pressure and temperature are sufficient to begin the next stage of fusion, reigniting to halt collapse.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>massive</b> {{globular}} cluster, named 037-B327 {{and discovered}} in 2006 as is heavily reddened by the Andromeda Galaxy's interstellar dust, {{was thought to}} be more <b>massive</b> than G1 and the largest cluster of the Local Group; however, other studies have shown it is actually similar in properties to G1.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 200 {{million light-years}} from Earth with a {{redshift}} of 0.016 is Abell 3627; {{also called the}} Norma Cluster, {{it is one of}} the most <b>massive</b> galaxy clusters known to exist, at ten times the average cluster mass. Abell 3627 is thus theorized to be the Great Attractor, a <b>massive</b> object that is pulling the Local Group, the Virgo Supercluster, and the Hydra-Centaurus Supercluster towards its location at 600–1000 kilometres per second.|$|E

5|$|Between {{these stars}} and Sirius lie Omicron1, Omicron2, and Pi Canis Majoris. Omicron2 is a <b>massive</b> supergiant star about 21 times as <b>massive</b> as the Sun. Only 7 million years old, it has {{exhausted}} {{the supply of}} hydrogen at its core and is now processing helium. It has an Alpha Cygni variable that undergoes periodic non-radial pulsations, which cause its brightness to cycle from magnitude 2.93 to 3.08 over a 24.44-day interval. Omicron1 is an orange K-type supergiant of spectral type K2.5Iab that is an irregular variable star, varying between apparent magnitudes 3.78 and 3.99. Around 18 times as <b>massive</b> as the Sun, it shines with 65,000 times its luminosity.|$|E

5|$|Core-collapse {{is thought}} to occur when the more <b>massive</b> stars in a {{globular}} cluster encounter their less <b>massive</b> companions. Over time, dynamic processes cause individual stars to migrate {{from the center of}} the cluster to the outside. This results in a net loss of kinetic energy from the core region, leading the remaining stars grouped in the core region to occupy a more compact volume. When this gravothermal instability occurs, the central region of the cluster becomes densely crowded with stars and the surface brightness of the cluster forms a power-law cusp. (Note that a core collapse is not the only mechanism that can cause such a luminosity distribution; a <b>massive</b> black hole at the core can also result in a luminosity cusp.) Over a lengthy period of time this leads to a concentration of <b>massive</b> stars near the core, a phenomenon called mass segregation.|$|E
5|$|Eris (68AU average) is {{the largest}} known {{scattered}} disc object, and caused a debate about what constitutes a planet, because it is 25% more <b>massive</b> than Pluto and about the same diameter. It is the most <b>massive</b> of the known dwarf planets. It has one known moon, Dysnomia. Like Pluto, its orbit is highly eccentric, with a perihelion of 38.2 AU (roughly Pluto's distance from the Sun) and an aphelion of 97.6 AU, and steeply inclined to the ecliptic plane.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-8 {{is a star}} {{located in}} the {{constellation}} Lyra {{in the field of}} view of the Kepler Mission, a NASA-led operation tasked with discovering terrestrial planets. The star, which is slightly hotter, larger, and more <b>massive</b> than the Sun, has one gas giant in its orbit, Kepler-8b. This gas giant is larger than Jupiter, but is less <b>massive,</b> and thus more diffuse. The planet's discovery was announced to the public on January 4, 2010 along with four other planets. As the fifth confirmed planetary system verified by Kepler, it helped demonstrate the capabilities of the Kepler spacecraft.|$|E

5|$|Mass loss {{is one of}} {{the most}} intensively studied aspects of <b>massive</b> star research. Put simply, using {{observed}} mass loss rates in the best models of stellar evolution does not reproduce the observed properties of evolved <b>massive</b> stars such as Wolf–Rayets, the number and types of core collapse supernovae, or their progenitors. To match those observations, the models require much higher mass loss rates. Eta Carinae A has one of the highest known mass loss rates, currently around /year, and is an obvious candidate for study.|$|E

5|$|Most 16O is {{synthesized}} {{at the end}} of the helium fusion {{process in}} <b>massive</b> stars but some is made in the neon burning process. 17O is primarily made by the burning of hydrogen into helium during the CNO cycle, making it a common isotope in the hydrogen burning zones of stars. Most 18O is produced when 14N (made abundant from CNO burning) captures a 4He nucleus, making 18O common in the helium-rich zones of evolved, <b>massive</b> stars.|$|E

5|$|Oberon, also {{designated}} , is {{the outermost}} major moon {{of the planet}} Uranus. It is the second-largest and second most <b>massive</b> of the Uranian moons, and the ninth most <b>massive</b> moon in the Solar System. Discovered by William Herschel in 1787, Oberon is named after the mythical king of the fairies who appears as a character in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Its orbit lies partially outside Uranus's magnetosphere.|$|E
5|$|Rotation {{rates of}} <b>massive</b> stars have a {{critical}} {{influence on their}} evolution and eventual death. The rotation rate of the Eta Carinae stars cannot be measured directly because their surfaces cannot be seen. Single <b>massive</b> stars spin down quickly due to braking from their strong winds, but there are hints that both Eta Carinae A and B are fast rotators, up to 90% of critical velocity. One or both could have been spun up by binary interaction, for example accretion onto the secondary and orbital dragging on the primary.|$|E
