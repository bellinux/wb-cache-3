5|$|The armed forces' third arm, the Liberian National Coast Guard, was {{established}} in 1959. Throughout the Tubman period the coastguard {{was little more than}} a few sometimes unserviceable patrol craft <b>manned</b> <b>by</b> ill-trained personnel, though its training improved in the 1980s to the point where it was considered the best trained of the armed services.|$|E
5|$|The {{first and}} second lines of Polish defences were <b>manned</b> <b>by</b> regular forces. These {{included}} three Polish infantry divisions: the 11th (from the Bug River to Leśniakowizna), the 8th (Leśniakowizna to Okuniew) and the 15th (Okuniew to the Vistula River). The 1st Army also held the newly arrived 1st Lithuanian-Belarusian Division in reserve (Marki–Kobyłka), while the Northern Front's headquarters reserves consisted of the 10th Infantry Division and some smaller units. The third line was <b>manned</b> <b>by</b> units of mobilised State Police {{and a variety of}} volunteer units of low combat value. Out of those units, initially only the 11th Division under Colonel Bolesław Jaźwiński took part in the fight. Its 48th Kresy Rifles Regiment (Colonel Łukowski) manned the Bugonarew-Mokre line, the 46th Kaniów Rifles Regiment (Colonel Krzywobłocki) manned the Mokre-Czarna perimeter, and the 47th Kresy Rifles Regiment (Lt. Colonel Szczepan) manned the Czarna–Leśniakowizna line. To the south of the 11th Division were positions around Wołomin <b>manned</b> <b>by</b> the 8th Infantry Division, consisting of the 36th, 21st and 33rd Infantry Regiments, as well as the 13th Infantry Regiment held in reserve, which later took part in the Battle of Ossów.|$|E

5|$|A {{special unit}} of the Stasi secret police worked covertly within the Grenztruppen, posing as regular border guards, between 1968 and 1985, to weed out {{potential}} defectors. One in ten officers and one in thirty enlisted men {{were said to have}} been recruited by the Stasi as informers. The Stasi regularly interviewed and maintained files on every guard. Stasi operatives were directly responsible for some aspects of security; passport control stations at crossings were <b>manned</b> <b>by</b> Stasi officers wearing Grenztruppen uniforms.|$|E
5|$|A watch post {{existed on}} Punta di Santa Maria (now known as Tigné Point after the fort) in 1417. The post was {{probably}} a small unfortified structure, which was <b>manned</b> <b>by</b> three persons.

After the siege, the peninsula became known as Dragut Point after the Ottoman corsair Dragut.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} days of November, the Yugoslav Navy stopped the Libertas convoy twice for {{inspection}} between the islands of Brač and Korčula as it enforced the blockade. The convoy of 40 small boats led by the ferry Slavija {{was on its way to}} resupply Dubrovnik and retrieve refugees from the besieged city. On 11 November, the Maltese-flagged coaster Euroriver, <b>manned</b> <b>by</b> a Croatian crew, was sunk by gunfire off Šolta Island.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of its deployment, the first contingent focused most of its efforts on providing accommodations for electoral centres and police stations. These were typically <b>manned</b> <b>by</b> {{only two or three}} police (or civilian) electoral staff and were almost always in small, remote villages. Buildings were leased, a large number of caravans purchased and deployed and prefabricated buildings constructed in about 50 locations. Much of this was done by the Resources Troop (under Lieutenant Stuart Graham), centrally controlled by squadron construction officer Captain Shane Miller.|$|E
5|$|Fort 56 {{consisted}} of three wings, each surrounded by its own earthwork, stockades and a moat. Partially obscured by the trees of Brühl's Garden, the central wing was further reinforced by the St. Laurence's Church and the surrounding monastery. The fort, commanded by General Józef Sowiński, was <b>manned</b> <b>by</b> two battalions of the 8th Regiment of Line Infantry (1,200 men), with 40 sappers, 13 cannon, two Congreve rocket launchers, and a small detachment from the 14th Regiment of Line Infantry (170 men). Directly in front of it, on a hill overlooking the battlefield, lay the smaller, irregularly-shaped Fort 57 <b>manned</b> <b>by</b> 300 men under Maj. Józef Krassowski, armed with four pieces of artillery and two Congreve rocket launchers. To the north lay Fort 59 (four cannon and 400 men under Maj. Józef Borzęcki), while to the south Fort 54 (up to 350 men under Maj. Ignacy Dobrzelewski and six guns under Lt. Julian Konstanty Ordon). Even though the remaining forts of Wola (Forts 55, 58, 60 and 61) were deprived of their garrisons to strengthen the defence, the most important Polish positions were still severely undermanned.|$|E

5|$|From December 1945 to May 1946 No.75 Squadron was {{maintained}} as a cadre located at Deniliquin and <b>manned</b> <b>by</b> one officer and three airmen without any aircraft. In May 1946 the squadron moved to RAAF Station Schofields near Sydney, {{but was not}} issued with any aircraft or further personnel until it moved to RAAF Base Williamtown in September that year and was equipped with P-51Mustang fighters. No.75 Squadron used these aircraft for routine training and exercises until it was disbanded on 25March 1948.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the military force, {{a number of other}} Australians served with UNTAG (including 25 observers from the Australian Electoral Commission).
