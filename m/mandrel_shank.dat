40|$|AbstractThe rotary draw bending(RDB) {{of large}} {{diameter}} thin-walled (LDTW) tube needs the strict cooperation of multiple processing parameters to avoid possible multiple defects. Due {{to the specific}} properties, the bending behaviors of LDTW commercial pure titanium (CP-Ti) tube are much more complex to achieve precise deformation. With the CP-Ti tube of 50. 8 mm (out diameter, D) × 0. 508 mm (wall thickness, t) × 101. 6 mm (bending radius, R) as a representative component, the bending behaviors of LDTW CP-Ti tube under different processing conditions were investigated. With experiments and analytical analysis, the bending characteristics of the CP-Ti tube were identified. Then, based on the orthogonal experimental design, a series of three-dimensional FE models of RDB for LDTW CP-Ti tube were established, {{and the effects of}} processing parameters on the bending behaviors were numerically investigated. The results show that: 1) Wrinkling is the primary behavior for the LDTW CP-Ti tube in RDB, and the larger the difference between the maximum wall thickening and the maximum wall thinning degrees of the bent tube, the larger the wrinkling tendency; 2) The bending behaviors of the LDTW CP-Ti tube are very sensitive to the some processing parameters, and the wrinkling is significantly affected by the <b>mandrel</b> <b>shank</b> diameter, while the wall thinning is remarkably affected by the clearance between wiper die and tube, <b>mandrel</b> <b>shank</b> diameter. The qualified bent tube with the wall thinning of 11. 43 %, the cross-section distortion of 2. 69 % and the wrinkling height less than 2 % is then obtained...|$|E
