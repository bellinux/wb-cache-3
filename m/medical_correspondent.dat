40|$|The project {{aimed to}} {{describe}} and critically evaluate information flows about medical research affecting UK quality newspapers. It focused particularly on the transfer of information from peer reviewed medical journals. In-depth {{interviews were conducted with}} media relations personnel at key organisations involved in medical research or more general health issues, and with specialist <b>medical</b> and health <b>correspondents</b> working for the national broadsheet press. The samples were purposively selected. Content analysis techniques were used to study news articles derived from information published in the British Medical Journal and the Lancet, which were compared with the original journal articles and any news releases associated with them. Many interacting factors shape media coverage of medical research and the personal motivations and preferences of a variety of individuals can play an important role. However, researchers, press officers and journalists are all constrained by their working relationships and contexts, so it is possible to identify certain common patterns of influence on the information flows. Press officers' activities are constrained by the characteristics and context of their organisations, particularly by the formal and cultural position of the press office within the organisation, and by relationships with other organisations in the field of interest which compete with their own for media access. Most importantly, they are constrained by their "go-between" role between their own organisation and media representatives who themselves operate under particular constraints. Press officers who liaise with researchers and journalists must seek acceptable compromises between scientific and news values. Specialist journalists are subject to the constraints of daily news reporting, and their stories must be strong in generally applicable news values {{if they are to be}} printed. The <b>medical</b> <b>correspondents</b> interviewed tried to avoid "over-sensationalisation" of stories because they had a sense of responsibility towards both their audience and their sources, but they had to be careful not to "kill" stories in their editors' eyes. Being unable to evaluate research evidence themselves, the journalists relied heavily on the authority of orthodox medical opinion in their story selection and development decisions. Their dependenceo n sourceso f authority encouragedt hem to write within a medical paradigm. Peer reviewed medical journals, articularly prestigious general journals, are regularly used as sources of news stories. Various factors encourage press officers and journalists to focus on a research project when it is about to be published. In particular, the peer review process is used by journalists as a quality safeguard, and journal policies against prior publication of material discourage researchers from discussing their work until it is safely in academically and professionally acceptable print. Several major medical research organisations invest heavily in media relations. Those which journalists regard as credible, and which can package information to suit their needs can successfully improve their media access. Future research should consider the roles of corporate culture and of competition between organisations involved with medical research in shaping information flows and media relations activity...|$|R
50|$|The book {{begins with}} three {{chapters}} discussing the Brigadiers' responses to Depression-era Britain, campaigns against fascism in the UK, and the debates and varying {{responses to the}} Spanish Civil War in British society. The final three chapters and the epilogue look at events after Franco's victory, including the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and the CPGB's withdrawal {{of support for the}} Second World War, which it deemed imperialist (a position it later reversed). The intervening seventeen chapters deal with the Civil War itself and cover, among other topics, Britons working in <b>medical</b> aid, foreign <b>correspondents,</b> the involvement of the Independent Labour Party, and the experience of those imprisoned in camps by Franco's Nationalists.|$|R

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{the understanding of}} health professionals involved in first-trimester ultrasound screening of the ethical stakes involved by addressing three questions regarding: how much these professionals know about Down syndrome screening by nuchal translucency thickness measurement; their personal opinion {{with respect to this}} screening test; and their attitude with respect to their patients, in order to answer the question: 'Are ethical principles respected when women are proposed ultrasound screening during the first trimester of pregnancy?' METHODS: We studied the medical population in the east part of France by sending a questionnaire to each of 460 <b>medical</b> <b>correspondents.</b> This questionnaire attempted to {{evaluate the}} respondent's level of medical knowledge, their personal opinion with respect to first-trimester screening and their attitude towards their patients. We adapted the three-dimensional diagram designed by Marteau et al. to develop a measure of informed choice regarding screening. Only health professionals who were relatively well informed and adopted an autonomy-oriented approach were considered {{to be in a position}} to obtain true consent from their patients, respecting ethical principles in terms of competence and the autonomy of patients. RESULTS: We received 276 (60 %) responses to the questionnaire. Only 31. 9 % of health professionals had an approach that facilitated obtaining true consent from their patients and respected the ethical principles of competence and patient autonomy; 46 % were in favor of the screening test and adopted an autonomy-oriented approach but were poorly informed; and 15. 4 % had a directive-authoritarian approach combined with poor knowledge. Regression analysis showed that two independent factors (speciality (P = 0. 031) and location of practice (P = 0. 034)) affected the level of medical knowledge, and two independent factors (location of practice (P = 0. 034) and the type of medical practice i. e. public or private (P < 0. 05)) affected the opinion of health professionals about the screening test. Two independent factors (speciality (P < 0. 001) and the age of the health professional (P = 0. 02)) affected the attitudes of health professionals towards their patients. CONCLUSION: The answer to the question 'Are ethical principles respected when women are proposed ultrasound screening during the first trimester of pregnancy?' is clearly 'No'. Major effort is required to ensure that the decisions made by patients are based on a possibility of true choice...|$|R

40|$|The {{balanced}} presentation {{afforded by}} convening a Citizens' Jury when considering a major question {{such as the}} introduction of a breast screening programme is advocated. This method would enable account to be taken of all the costs, both human and financial, to all those affected, both participating and organizing, as well as the benefits. Provision of such a democratic opportunity enables consideration to be given to a broad range of factors, by selection of an appropriate range of witnesses, with the advantage of involving the lay public in this decision-making process. Attendance by health <b>correspondents,</b> <b>medical</b> journalists and other media representatives enables publicization of a democracy in action whilst helping to inform the wider debate.

Results: the nurse’s notable difficulty in both prioritizing their actions and elaborating solutions to complex chores undermine any possibility of tackling simple duties successfully. Conclusion: notwithstanding, in order to lay bare some old paradigms (biomedical, hegemonic) and to give nurses a better consciousness comprehension of their real importance in society, we ought to find new tools {{that will allow them}} not only reach autonomy as qualified professionals but also act motivated individuals...|$|R
40|$|During his {{ophthalmological}} assistantship in Paris, Theodor Leber* (1840 - 1917) made acquain- tance {{with the}} American <b>medical</b> officer and <b>correspondent</b> Darley, {{who came in}} the mission {{to report on the}} situation after the battle of Königgrätz in the United States. The 26 year old Theodor Leber was im- mediately with fire and flame to travel with him and got hold of a visa issued at the Prussian Embassy in Paris on July 13, 1866. However, this battle had already taken place on July 3. All the wounded from the battlefield were supplied and transported away. But, {{it turned out that the}} hospitals were all still full of wounded of both sides, Prussia and Austria, and always have enough surgical operations to do. The war was not yet over, but the victorious Prussian army moved on to Vienna. Wounded soldiers were re trans- ported as quickly as possible to the hospitals around Sadowa.
