40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{high-level}} waste (HLW) glass <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> study is two-fold: (1) {{to gain a better}} understanding of the impact of feed chemistry on <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> through bench-scale testing, and (2) to develop a predictive tool for <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> in support of the on-going frit development efforts for the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). In particular, the focus is on predicting relative <b>melt</b> <b>rates,</b> not the absolute <b>melt</b> <b>rates,</b> of various HLW glass formulations solely based on feed chemistry, i. e., the chemistry of both waste and glass-forming frit for DWPF. Critical to the successful <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> modeling is the accurate determination of the <b>melting</b> <b>rates</b> of various HLW glass formulations. The baseline procedure being used at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) is to; (1) heat a 4 inch-diameter stainless steel beaker containing a mixture of dried sludge and frit in a furnace for a preset period of time, (2) section the cooled beaker along its diameter, and (3) measure the average glass height across the sectioned face using a ruler. As illustrated in Figure 1 - 1, the glass height is measured for each of the 16 horizontal segments up to the red lines where relatively large-sized bubbles begin to appear. The linear <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> (LMR) is determined as the average of all 16 glass height readings divided by the time during which the sample was kept in the furnace. This 'visual' method has proved useful in identifying melting accelerants such as alkalis and sulfate and further ranking the relative <b>melt</b> <b>rates</b> of candidate frits for a given sludge batch. However, one of the inherent technical difficulties of this method is to determine the glass height in the presence of numerous gas bubbles of varying sizes, which is prevalent especially for the higher-waste-loading glasses. That is, how the red lines are drawn in Figure 1 - 1 can be subjective and, therefore, may influence the resulting <b>melt</b> <b>rates</b> significantly. For example, if the red lines are drawn too low, a significant amount of glassy material interspersed among the gas bubbles will be excluded, thus underestimating the <b>melt</b> <b>rate.</b> Likewise, if they are drawn too high, many large voids will be counted as glass, thus overestimating the <b>melt</b> <b>rate.</b> As will be shown later in this report, there is also no guarantee that a given distribution of glass and gas bubbles along a particular sectioned plane will always be representative of the entire sample volume. Poor reproducibility seen in some LMR data may be related to these difficulties of the visual method. In addition, further improvement of the existing <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> model requires that the overall impact of feed chemistry on <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> be reflected on measured data at a greater quantitative resolution on a more consistent basis than the visual method can provide. An alternate method being pursued is X-ray computed tomography (CT). It involves X-ray scanning of glass samples, performing CT on the 2 -D X-ray images to build 3 -D volumetric data, and adaptive segmentation analysis of CT results to not only identify but quantify the distinct regions within each sample based on material density and morphologies. The main advantage of this new method is that it can determine the relative local density of the material remaining in the beaker after the heat treatment regardless of its morphological conditions by selectively excluding all the voids greater than a given volumetric pixel (voxel) size, thus eliminating much of the subjectivity involved in the visual method. As a result, the <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> data obtained from CT scan will give quantitative descriptions not only on the fully-melted glass, but partially-melted and unmelted feed materials. Therefore, the CT data are presumed to be more reflective of the actual <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> trends in continuously-fed melters than the visual data. In order to test the applicability of X-ray CT scan to the HLW glass <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> study, several new series of HLW simulant/frit mixtures were melted in the <b>Melt</b> <b>Rate</b> Furnace (MRF) and the contents of each cooled but un-sectioned beaker were CT scanned and analyzed. For comparison purposes, a cross-sectional X-ray image of each sample was used to estimate the <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> using the visual method. In order to see the impact of feed chemistry on <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> more clearly, a total of ten frit-only glasses (i. e., no waste) were also made, CT scanned and analyzed. In addition, two historical glass series which were previously sectioned were re-joined and CT scanned; the results were then compared to the visual data obtained earlier. All the work performed on these historical samples will be documented separately in another report. This report describes the methodologies used to interpret and apply the results of X-ray CT scans to the HLW <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> study and further highlights some of the key results on the compositional dependence of <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> and the cross-comparison of the visual and CT results...|$|R

40|$|Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) was {{requested}} {{to provide the}} Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) with a frit composition for Sludge Batch 5 (SB 5) to optimize processing. A series of experiments were designed for testing in the <b>Melt</b> <b>Rate</b> Furnace (MRF). This dry fed tool {{can be used to}} quickly determine relative <b>melt</b> <b>rates</b> for a large number of candidate frit compositions and lead to a selection for further testing. Simulated Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank (SRAT) product was made {{according to the most recent}} SB 5 sludge projections and a series of tests were conducted with frits that covered a range of boron and alkali ratios. Several frits with relatively large projected operating windows indicated <b>melt</b> <b>rates</b> that would not severely impact production.

40|$|The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) was tasked {{to provide}} an {{assessment}} of the downstream impacts to the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) of decisions regarding the implementation of Al-dissolution to support sludge mass reduction and processing. Based on future sludge batch compositional projections from the Liquid Waste Organization's (LWO) sludge batch plan, assessments have been made with respect to the ability to maintain comparable projected operating windows for sludges with and without Al-dissolution. As part of that previous assessment, candidate frits were identified to provide insight into <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> for average sludge batches representing with and without Al-dissolution flowsheets. Initial <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> studies using the <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> furnace (MRF) were performed using five frits each for Cluster 2 and Cluster 4 compositions representing average without and with Al-dissolution. It was determined, however, that the REDOX endpoint (Fe{sup 2 +}/{Sigma}Fe for the glass) for Clusters 2 and 4 resulted in an overly oxidized feed which negatively affected the initial <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> tests. After the sludge was adjusted to a more reduced state, additional testing was performed with frits that contained both high and low concentrations of sodium and boron oxides. These frits were selected strictly based on the ability to ascertain compositional trends in <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> and did not necessarily apply to any acceptability criteria for DWPF processing. The <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> data are in general agreement with historical trends observed at SRNL and during processing of SB 3 (Sludge Batch 3) and SB 4 in DWPF. When MAR acceptability criteria were applied, Frit 510 was seen to have the highest <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> at 0. 67 in/hr for Cluster 2 (without Al-dissolution), which is compositionally similar to SB 4. For Cluster 4 (with Al-dissolution), which is compositionally similar to SB 3, Frit 418 had the highest <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> at 0. 63 in/hr. Based on this data, {{there appears to be a}} slight advantage of the Frit 510 based system without Al-dissolution relative to the Frit 418 based system with Al-dissolution. Though the without aluminum dissolution scenario suggests a slightly higher <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> with frit 510, several points must be taken into consideration: (1) The MRF does not have the ability to assess liquid feeds and, thus, rheology impacts. Instead, the MRF is a 'static' test bed in which a mass of dried melter feed (SRAT product plus frit) is placed in an 'isothermal' furnace for a period of time to assess <b>melt</b> <b>rate.</b> These conditions, although historically effective in terms of identifying candidate frits for specific sludge batches and mapping out <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> versus waste loading trends, do not allow for assessments of the potential impact of feed rheology on <b>melt</b> <b>rate.</b> That is, if the rheological properties of the slurried melter feed resulted in the mounding of the feed in the melter (i. e., the melter feed was thick and did not flow across the cold cap), <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> and/or melter operations (i. e., surges) could be negatively impacted. This could affect one or both flowsheets. (2) Waste throughput factors were not determined for Frit 510 and Frit 418 over multiple waste loadings. In order to provide insight into the mission life versus canister count question, one needs to define the maximum waste throughput for both flowsheets. Due to funding limitations, the <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> testing only evaluated <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> at a fixed waste loading. (3) DWPF will be processing SB 5 through their facility in mid-November 2008. Insight into the over arching questions of <b>melt</b> <b>rate,</b> waste throughput, and mission life can be obtained directly from the facility. It is recommended that processing of SB 5 through the facility be monitored closely and that data be used as input into the decision making process on whether to implement Al-dissolution for future sludge batches...|$|R

Because all of this testing was performed on small-scale equipment with dried or slurred, nonradioactive simulant, the exact impact of feed acid stoichiometry and REDOX on the radioactive sludge in a DWPF-sized melter could not be quantified...|$|R
40|$|The {{injection}} {{at depth}} of ice sheet runoff into fjords {{may be an}} important control on the frontal <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> of tidewater glaciers. Here we develop a new parameterization for ice marginal plumes within the Massachusetts Institute of Technology General Circulation Model (MITgcm), allowing three-dimensional simulation of large (500 km 2) glacial fjords on annual (or longer) time scales. We find that for an idealized fjord (without shelf-driven circulation), subglacial runoff produces a thin, strong, and warm down-fjord current in {{the upper part of the}} water column, balanced by a thick and slow up-fjord current at greater depth. Although submarine <b>melt</b> <b>rates</b> increase with runoff due to higher <b>melt</b> <b>rates</b> where the plume is in contact with the ice front, we find that annual submarine <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> across the ice front is relatively insensitive to variability in annual runoff. Better knowledge of the spatial distribution of runoff, controls on <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> in those areas not directly in contact with plumes, and feedback mechanisms linking submarine melting and iceberg calving are necessary to more fully understand the sensitivity of glacier mass balance to runoff-driven fjord circulation...|$|R
40|$|Previous Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> {{tests in}} support of the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) have {{indicated}} that improvements in <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> can be achieved through an increase in the total alkali of the melter feed. Higher alkali can be attained by the use of an ''underwashed'' sludge, a high alkali frit, or a combination of the two. Although the general trend between <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> and total alkali (in particular Na{sub 2 }O content) has been demonstrated, the question of ''does the source of alkali (SOA) matter?'' still exists. Therefore the purpose of this set of tests was to determine if the source of alkali (frit versus sludge) can impact <b>melt</b> <b>rate.</b> The general test concept was to transition from a Na{sub 2 }O-rich frit to a Na{sub 2 }O-deficient frit while compensating the Na{sub 2 }O content in the sludge to maintain the same overall Na{sub 2 }O content in the melter feed. Specifically, the strategy was to vary the amount of alkali in frits and in the sludge batch 3 (SB 3) sludge simulant (midpoint or baseline feed was SB 3 /Frit 418 at 35 % waste loading) so that the resultant feeds had the same final glass composition when vitrified. A set of SOA feeds using frits ranging from 0 to 16 weight % Na{sub 2 }O (in 4 % increments) was first tested in the <b>Melt</b> <b>Rate</b> Furnace (MRF) to determine if indeed there was an impact. The dry-fed MRF tests indicated that if the alkali is too depleted from either the sludge (16 % Na{sub 2 }O feed) or the frit (the 0 % Na{sub 2 }O feed), then <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> was negatively impacted when compared to the baseline SB 3 /Frit 418 feed currently being processed at DWPF. The MRF <b>melt</b> <b>rates</b> for the 4 and 12 % SOA feeds were similar to the baseline SB 3 /Frit 418 (8 % SOA) feed. Due to this finding, a smaller subset of SOA feeds that could be processed in the DWPF (4 and 12 % SOA feeds) was then tested in the Slurry-fed <b>Melt</b> <b>Rate</b> Furnace (SMRF). The results from a previous SMRF test with SB 3 /Frit 418 (Smith et al. 2004) were used as the SMRF <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> of the baseline feed. The SOA SMRF test results agreed with those of the MRF tests for these two feeds as the <b>melt</b> <b>rates</b> were similar to the baseline SB 3 /Frit 418 feed. In other words, the source of alkali was close enough to the baseline feed as to not negatively impact <b>melt</b> <b>rate.</b> Based on these results, there appears to be an acceptable range of the source of alkali that results in the highest <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> for a particular sludge batch. If, however, the alkali is too depleted from either the sludge or the frit, then <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> will be lower. Although SB 3 simulant sludge and Frit 418 were used for these tests, it was not the intent of these tests to determine an optimum source of alkali range for SB 3. Rather, the findings of these tests should be used to help in the decision process for future sludge batch washing and/or blending strategies. The results, however, do confirm that the current processing of SB 3 is being performed in the proper source of alkali range. Because all of this testing was performed on small-scale equipment with slurried, non-radioactive simulant, the exact impact of the source of alkali with SB 3 in the DWPF melter could not be fully evaluated...|$|R
5000|$|During {{the middle}} of the 20th century, {{examination}} of the maps and photographs from the previous century provided clear evidence that the 150 glaciers known to have existed in the park a hundred years earlier had greatly retreated, and in many cases disappeared altogether. Repeat photography of the glaciers, such as the pictures taken of Grinnell Glacier between 1938 and 2009 as shown, help to provide visual confirmation of the extent of glacier retreat.In the 1980s, the U.S. Geological Survey began a more systematic study of the remaining glaciers, which has continued to the present day. By 2010, 37 glaciers remained, but only 25 of these were considered to be [...] "active glaciers" [...] of at least 25 acre in area. The National Park Service warns that if the current warming trend continues, the park's remaining glaciers will be gone by 2030. This glacier retreat follows a worldwide pattern that has accelerated even more since 1980. Without a major climatic change in which cooler and moister weather returns and persists, the mass balance, which is the accumulation rate versus the ablation (<b>melting)</b> <b>rate</b> of glaciers, will continue to be negative and the glaciers have been projected to eventually disappear, leaving behind only barren rock.|$|E
5000|$|There {{was not one}} {{bottleneck}} to faster casting production {{but rather}} several. Improvements were made in molding speed, molding sand preparation, sand mixing, core manufacturing processes, and the slow metal <b>melting</b> <b>rate</b> in cupola furnaces. In 1912, the sand slinger was invented by the American company Beardsley & Piper. In 1912, the first sand mixer with individually mounted revolving plows was marketed by the Simpson Company. In 1915, the first experiments started with bentonite clay instead of simple fire clay as the bonding additive to the molding sand. This increased tremendously the green and dry strength of the molds. In 1918, the first fully automated foundry for fabricating hand grenades for the U.S. Army went into production. In the 1930s the first high-frequency coreless electric furnace was installed in the U.S. In 1943, ductile iron was invented by adding magnesium to the widely used grey iron. In 1940, thermal sand reclamation was applied for molding and core sands. In 1952, the [...] "D-process" [...] was developed for making shell molds with fine, pre-coated sand. In 1953, the hotbox core sand {{process in which the}} cores are thermally cured was invented. In 1954, a new core binder—water glass (sodium silicate), hardened with CO2 from ambient air, came into use.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstractBackground“Foie gras” is {{produced}} predominantly in France and about 90 % of the commercialized product is obtained from male mule ducks. The <b>melting</b> <b>rate</b> (percentage of fat released during cooking) {{is the main}} criterion {{used to determine the}} quality of “foie gras”. However, up to now the <b>melting</b> <b>rate</b> could not be predicted without causing liver damage, which means that selection programs could not use this criterion. MethodsFatty liver phenotypes were obtained for a population of over 1400 overfed male mule ducks. The phenotypes were based on two types of near-infrared spectra (on the liver surface and on ground liver) in order to predict the <b>melting</b> <b>rate</b> and liver composition (ash, dry matter, lipid and protein contents). Genetic parameters were computed in multiple traits with a “sire-dam” model and using a Gibbs sampling approach. ResultsThe estimates for the genetic parameters show that the measured <b>melting</b> <b>rate</b> and the predicted <b>melting</b> <b>rate</b> obtained with two near-infrared spectrometer devices are genetically the same trait: genetic correlations are very high (ranging from + 0. 89 to + 0. 97 depending on the mule duck parental line and the spectrometer) and heritabilities are comparable. The predictions based on the spectra of ground liver samples using a laboratory spectrometer correlate with those based on the surface spectra using a portable spectrometer (from + 0. 83 to + 0. 95 for dry matter, lipid and protein content) and are particularly high for the <b>melting</b> <b>rate</b> (higher than + 0. 95). Although less accurate than the predictions obtained using the spectra of ground liver samples, the phenotypic prediction of the <b>melting</b> <b>rate</b> based on surface spectra is sufficiently accurate to be used by “foie gras” processors. ConclusionsNear-infrared spectrometry is an efficient tool to select liver quality in breeding programs because animals can be ranked according to their liver <b>melting</b> <b>rate</b> without damaging their livers. Thus, these original results will help breeders to select ducks based on the liver <b>melting</b> <b>rate,</b> a crucial criterion that defines the quality of the liver and for which there was previously no accurate predictor...|$|E

Each of the simulations begins with a geometry and velocity close to present-day observations, and evolves according to variation in meteoric ice accumulation rates and oceanic ice shelf <b>melt</b> <b>rates.</b> Future changes in accumulation and <b>melt</b> <b>rates</b> range from no change, through anomalies computed by atmosphere and ocean models driven by the E 1 and A 1 B emissions scenarios, to spatially uniform <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> anomalies that remove most of the ice shelves over a few centuries.

40|$|The Quartz <b>Melt</b> <b>Rate</b> Furnace (QMRF) was {{developed}} to study the <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> and offgas composition of simulated Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) melter feed. The objective of this testing was to evaluate whether the apparatus {{could be used to}} study the offgas chemistry of melting batches and perform small-scale slurry-fed <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> tests. The furnace was tested in three different configurations: a dry-fed test with offgas analysis, a slurry-fed test without offgas analysis, and a slurry-fed test with offgas analysis. During the dry-fed test, offgas composition was successfully measured throughout the run and total offgas flow was calculated from the helium tracer concentration. During the slurry-feeding tests without offgas analysis, the furnace exhibited stable feeding behavior with no problems with feed tube pluggage. Feeding behavior was used to measure the <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> of Sludge Batch 3 with Frit 320 and with Frit 418. Both frits had approximately the same <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> during the tests based on amount of melter feed added per minute. During the slurry-fed test with offgas analysis, spikes in the data prevented overall offgas flow analysis from the helium tracer, but the ratio of different offgas species allowed the composition data to be compared between runs. Minor improvements were identified that would enhance the performance of the furnace and further testing should be performed to optimize the performance of the apparatus. These tests should focus on increasing the stability of offgas composition data by providing more surge capacity in the offgas system, determining the sensitivity of the furnace to <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> during slurry-fed tests and refining the lid heat power to optimize <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> measurements, and to develop the capability to utilize the system with radioactive feeds...|$|R
40|$|The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) was {{requested}} to provide Savannah River Remediation (SRR) with a recommended frit composition for Sludge Batch 6 (SB 6) to optimize processing at the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). This report discusses {{the results of}} a series of <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> experiments that were completed in support of the frit recommendation and the preparation of the feed used in the testing. The objective of the work was to identify the impact of individual frit component concentrations on <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> for both SB 6 and for DWPF sludge batches in general. The dry fed, <b>Melt</b> <b>Rate</b> Furnace (MRF) was used to compare the relative <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> performance of several candidate frit compositions. Sludge composition projection changes and variation led to the fabrication and testing of several new frits along with Frit 418, which is currently utilized at the DWPF for Sludge Batch 5 (SB 5) processing. The <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> testing results show that changes in the frit composition, such as increases in B{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } or Li{sub 2 }O concentrations, can provide a faster <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> for SB 6 relative to Frit 418. However, the composition of SB 6 as currently projected (February 2010 blended with a 40 inch heel of SB 5) does not allow for significant changes in frit composition relative to Frit 418 without compromising the projected operating windows. Only one of the new frits tested, Frit IS 7, remains viable for SB 6 processing based on the current composition projections. The <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> results also demonstrated that a low Na{sub 2 }O concentration frit (particularly Frit IS 7) can provide reasonable <b>melt</b> <b>rates</b> if the concentrations of Li{sub 2 }O or B{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } in the frit are increased. The measured <b>melt</b> <b>rate</b> for Frit IS 7 with the simulated SB 6 feed was about 15 % faster than that for Frit 418. The projected operating windows for Frits 418 and IS 7 are very similar with the current SB 6 projections. However, waste loadings with Frit IS 7 are limited by low viscosity predictions, while waste loadings with Frit 418 are limited by predictions of nepheline crystallization. It is recommended that SRNL reevaluate the final SB 6 composition once washing and blending are complete to determine whether a change in frit composition could provide improved operating windows, improved sulfate solubility, and/or increased waste throughput...|$|R
