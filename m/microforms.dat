40|$|Micro-scaled plastic deformation, viz., <b>microforming,</b> {{has been}} widely used to {{fabricate}} microparts {{with at least two}} dimensions in submillimeter. In <b>microforming,</b> ductile fracture significantly affects product quality and the forming limit of materials. It happens when the deformation method, mode and sequence are not reasonable. Although extensive research on ductile fracture and ductile fracture criteria in macroforming domain has been conducted, the applicability of these criteria in <b>microforming</b> scenario has not yet been extensively explored and studied. It is thus necessary to explore and address this issue to support the design of <b>microforming</b> process and quality control of the <b>microformed</b> parts. In this paper, the applicability of the uncoupled ductile fracture criteria's in <b>microforming</b> is investigated and discussed. The hybrid constitutive model developed in prior research is used to study the applicability of ductile fracture criteria in <b>microforming</b> via finite element simulation and physical experiments. The simulation results of each criterion are compared with the upsetting experiment to determine the most suitable criterion for further experimental implementation in flanged upsetting and extrusion processes. The influence of size-effects on the applicability of the uncoupled ductile fracture criteria is explored and the stress-induced fracture map is used to demonstrate this effect. The applicability of ductile fracture criteria in <b>microforming</b> is extensively revealed and analyzed and the research thus provides an in-depth understanding of the applicability of ductile fracture criteria in <b>microforming</b> processes.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} demand for {{the quality and quantity}} of miniaturized parts, fabrication of microparts directly using sheet metals is proven to be promising and efficient for mass production. In this process, however, there are many unknowns in terms of size effect and its affected fracture and deformation behavior. This study is thus aimed at investigating the micromechanical damage and deformation behavior in progressive <b>microforming</b> and establishing a systematic knowledge to support the <b>microformed</b> part design, process configuration and tooling design. In detail, a micro cylindrical part is fabricated via shearing process and a multi-level flanged part is produced via progressive micro extrusion and blanking. To explore the effect of material microstructure on the deformation behavior, ductile fracture and the product quality of <b>microformed</b> part, the original sheet metals are annealed under different temperatures. To realize the <b>microforming</b> process, a progressive <b>microforming</b> system is developed and its characteristics are investigated. The effect of grain size on dimensional accuracy, microstructure evolution and fracture behavior in <b>microforming</b> is also studied. The ductile fracture and its induced defects are identified and the damage accumulation is predicted. In the end, the validity and applicability of different fracture criteria in <b>microforming</b> is discussed. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{ubiquitous}} trend of product miniaturization, energy saving and weight reduction, micro/meso-scale parts {{have been widely}} used in many industrial clusters. Micromanufacturing processes for production of such micro/meso-scale parts are thus critically needed. <b>Microforming,</b> as one of these micro manufacturing processes, is a promising process and thus got many explorations and researches. Compared with the research on size effect affected deformation behaviours, less {{attention has been paid to}} the process development for mass production of micro-parts. The product quality and fabrication productivity of micro-parts depend on the involved process chain. To address the difficulty in handling and transporting of the micro-sized workpiece, development of a progressive <b>microforming</b> process for directly fabricating bulk micro-parts using sheet metals seems quite promising as it avoids or facilitates billet handling, transportation, positioning, and ejection in the process chain. In this paper, an intensive review on the latest development of progressive <b>microforming</b> technologies is presented. First of all, the paper summarizes the characteristic of progressive <b>microforming</b> directly using sheet metal. The size effect-affected deformation behaviour and the dimensional accuracy, deformation load, ductile fracture, and the surface finish of the <b>microformed</b> parts by progressive <b>microforming</b> using sheet metals are then presented.
