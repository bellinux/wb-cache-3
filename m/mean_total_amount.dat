40|$|Summary. Achillea millefolium L. {{sensu lato}} (yarrow) is the best-known {{species of the}} genus Achillea due to {{numerous}} medicinal applications both in folk and conventional medicine. Phenolic compounds such as flavonoids and phenol carbonic acids are present in yarrow and constitute {{one of the most}} important groups of pharmacologically active substances. In the present study, yarrow flowers gathered from native populations in different locations of Lithuania were analyzed for phenolic compound composition. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used for chemical analyses. Eight phenolic compounds – chlorogenic acid and flavonoids, namely vicenin- 2, luteolin- 3 ', 7 -di-O-glucoside, luteolin- 7 -O-glucoside, rutin, apigenin- 7 -O-glucoside, luteolin, and apigenin – were identified in the extracts from yarrow flowers. Considerable variation in accumulation of phenolic compounds among the flowers from different locations was observed. The samples were divided into two main groups based on chemical composition: the first group was characterized by lower than the <b>mean</b> <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> of the identified phenolics; the second was formed from samples accumulating higher concentrations of investigated secondary metabolites.

Eight healthy male subjects received a single 399 -mg (81. 7 μCi) oral dose of [14 C]posaconazole after consuming a high-fat breakfast. Urine, feces, and blood samples were collected for up to 336 h postdose and assayed for total radioactivity; plasma and urine samples were also assayed for parent drug. Posaconazole was orally bioavailable, with a median maximum posaconazole concentration in plasma achieved by 10 h postdose. Thereafter, posaconazole was slowly eliminated, with a mean half-life of 20 h. The greatest peak in the radioactivity profile of pooled plasma extracts was due to posaconazole, with smaller peaks due to a monoglucuronide, a diglucuronide, and a smaller fragment of the molecule. The <b>mean</b> <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> of radioactivity recovered was 91. 1 %; the cumulative excretion of radioactivity in feces and in urine was 76. 9 and 14. 0 % of the dose, respectively. Most of the fecal radioactivity was associated with posaconazole, which accounted for 66. 3 % of the administered dose; however, urine contained only trace amounts of unchanged posaconazole. The radioactivity profile of pooled urine extracts included two monoglucuronide conjugates and a diglucuronide conjugate of posaconazole. These observations suggest that oxidative (phase 1) metabolism by cytochrome P 450 isoforms represents only a minor route of elimination for posaconazole, and therefore cytochrome P 450 -mediated drug interactions should have a limited potential to impact posaconazole pharmacokinetics...|$|E

The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess the efficacy of intra-articular morphine and bupivacaine on the joint flexion and extension angles of patients with knee osteoarthritis. DESIGN AND SETTING: A randomized double-blind study was performed at a pain clinic of Universidade Federal de São Paulo. METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with pain for more than three months, of intensity greater than three on a numerical scale (zero to 10), were included. G 1 patients received 1 mg (1 ml) of morphine diluted in 9 ml of saline, intra-articularly, and G 2 patients received 25 mg (10 ml) of 0. 25 % bupivacaine without epinephrine. Pain was assessed on a numerical scale and knee flexion and extension angles were measured after administration of the drugs at rest and during movement. The total amount of analgesic supplementation using 500 mg doses of paracetamol was also determined. RESULTS: No significant difference in pain intensity was observed between G 1 and G 2. Significant decreases in pain at rest and during movement and significant increases in mean flexion and extension angles were observed in both groups, with no significant difference between the two groups.

40|$|ABSTRACTLidocaine is {{commonly}} used for local anesthesia during fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB). It {{has been suggested that}} the total dose of lidocaine should be limited to 300 - 400 mg (or < 8. 2 mg/kg). Lidocaine toxicity is directly correlated with its concentration in the blood and a threshold above which the side effects become more likely has been put at a plasma level of 5 μg/ml. The aim of our study was to determine plasmatic lidocaine concentrations (PLC), how often the PLC fall into the potentially toxic range and its correlation with adverse reactions. PLC were recorded in 30 patients undergoing FOB. Lidocaine was administered as a 2 % gel, 10 % spray and 2 % solution. Venous blood samples were taken before the beginning of local anesthesia and at 20, 30 and 40 min thereafter. The <b>mean</b> <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> of lidocaine administered was 746. 3 ± 159. 5 mg (11. 6 ± 3. 1 mg/kg). Before the beginning of anesthesia, no significant levels of lidocaine were measurable in the patients. PLC were 3. 2 ± 1. 7 μg/ml at 20 min., 3. 3 ± 1. 7 μg/ml at 30 min. and 3. 0 ± 1. 5 μg/ml at 40 min. The PLC exceeded toxic levels in 6 patients, but no complications were observed. Our data show that although the amount of lidocaine used in this study exceeded the recommended highest dose, no subjects had signs of toxicity. A maximum dose of lidocaine for topical anesthesia should be determined despite the fact that an average total dose superior to 400 mg appears to be safe in patients undergoing FOB.

40|$|Stephen M CohenAtlanta Colon and Rectal Surgery, PA, Atlanta, GA, USABackground: The {{majority}} of surgical patients experience significant levels of pain after a procedure. While opioid analgesics {{have been a}} mainstay of postsurgical analgesic regimens, recent evidence has supported the use of multimodal therapy {{as a way to}} decrease opioid usage with its concomitant opioid-related adverse events. The goal of multimodal therapy is to minimize the negative effects of these events on clinical and economic outcomes. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the opioid burden and health economic outcomes in patients undergoing open colectomy who received a liposomal bupivacaine-based multimodal analgesic regimen as compared with a standard opioid-based regimen for postsurgical pain. Methods: In this open-label, single-center, sequential-cohort study, adults undergoing open colectomy were assigned to treatment via patient-controlled analgesia with opioids (first cohort) or multimodal analgesia therapy including a single administration of liposomal bupivacaine (second cohort). Both treatment groups were offered rescue analgesia as needed. The main outcome measures were total mg amount of opioids consumed after surgery, total hospital costs, and length of hospital stay. Adverse events, including opioid-related adverse events, were recorded. Results: Thirty-nine patients were enrolled, 18 in the opioid-based analgesia group and 21 in the multimodal analgesia group. <b>Mean</b> <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> of postsurgical opioids consumed was significantly less in the multimodal analgesia group (57 mg) compared with the opioid analgesia group (115 mg; P = 0. 025).

Methods: QCF was collected from 15 patients with untreated adult periodontitis. sCD 14 levels were determined by ELISA and presented as total amount (ng/site) and concentration (μg/ml). The periodontal examination consisted of plaque index (PI), bleeding index (BI), probing depth (PD), and clinical attachment level (CAL). PD and CAL were measured with an electronic probe. Results: sCD 14 was detected in all 15 subjects and was found in 59 % (62 / 105) of the sampled sites. The percentage of sites with sCD 14 varied greatly, ranging from 14 % to 100 %. The <b>mean</b> <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> of sCD 14 was 1. 71 ± 0. 40, range 0. 03 to 5. 41 ng/site; the concentration of sCD 14 was 14. 04 ± 4. 15, range 0. 16 to 51. 74 (μ/ml. No significant difference in clinical data {{was found between the}} sites with and without detectable levels of sCD 14. However, {{on the basis of the}} individual profile of sCD 14 levels, i. e., those individuals with > 50 % of the sites containing sCD 14 and mean levels of sCD 14 > 5. 0 μg/ml, the 15 subjects were divided into a high sCD 14 group (9 subjects) and a low sCD 14 group (6 subjects). Compared to the high group, the low group showed greater mean PD and a higher percentage of sites with PD ≥ 5. 0 mm (P< 0. 05). Consistent with this, sCD 14 concentrations showed a negative correlation with PD (rs =- 0. 636, P = 0. 0174). Conclusions: The present study shows that sCD 14 levels in GCF varied greatly among subjects with untreated adult periodontitis. Individuals with higher levels of sCD 14 in GCF and more sites containing sCD 14 had fewer deep pockets. The negative correlation between GCF sCD 14 levels and probing depth implies a crucial role of sCD 14 in bacterially induced periodontal destruction.

This pilot study assessed the preliminary efficacy {{and safety of}} two volumes of liposome bupivacaine administered via TAP infiltration in patients undergoing robotic laparoscopic prostatectomy. Methods: In this single-center, open-label, prospective study, patients older than 18 years received TAP infiltration with liposome bupivacaine immediately after surgery. The first 12 patients received a total volume of 20 mL liposome bupivacaine (266 mg); the next 12 received 40 mL liposome bupivacaine (266 mg). The liposome bupivacaine was diluted with 0. 9 % normal saline. The primary efficacy measure was duration of analgesia, measured by time to first opioid administration. Secondary outcome measures included patient-assessed pain scores, opioid use, and opioid-related adverse events (AEs). Results: Twenty-four patients received liposome bupivacaine (20 mL, n= 12; 40 mL, n= 12) and {{were included in the}} primary analysis. Three refused participation in a 10 -day follow-up visit and did not complete the study.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe aim of {{the study}} is to compare ultrasound-guided foam {{sclerotherapy}} (UGFS: injection of foam sclerosant under ultrasound guidance) of the great saphenous vein (GSV) combined with visual foam sclerotherapy (VFS: injection of foam sclerosant under visual control) for varicose tributary veins and VFS alone in the treatment of GSV reflux. Design and methodsA total of 133 limbs in 97 patients with GSV reflux were randomised to receive either VFS alone or VFS combined with UGFS. In both groups, 1 % polidocanol foam was used. Assessments included duplex ultrasonography, evaluation of Venous Clinical Severity Scores (VCSS) and CEAP (clinical, etiologic, anatomic, and pathophysiologic) scores. Ultrasonographic inspection of the foam in the GSV was carried out during 5  min before compression was applied. The primary ‘end’ point of the study was obliteration of the GSV at 6 months. ResultsA total of 51 limbs in 48 patients were treated with UGFS + VFS and the remaining 52 limbs in 49 patients were treated with VFS alone. There were no significant inter-group differences in patient age, male: female ratio, height, weight, body mass index, CEAP clinical scores or VCSS. The GSV diameter was 6. 0  ±  1. 7  mm (median ± interquartile range) in the UGFS + VFS group and 5. 7  ±  1. 6  mm in the VFS group (p =  0. 419). The mean injected volume of foam for varicose tributary veins was 4  ±  2  ml in the UGFS + VFS group and 6  ±  2  ml in the VFS group, a significantly higher amount of foam being used in the latter (p <  0. 001). However, the <b>mean</b> <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> of foam was greater in limbs treated with UFGS + VFS than in those treated with VFS alone (p =  0. 017). Ultrasonographic inspection revealed complete vasospasm of the GSV in 37 (72. 5 %) limbs in the UGFS + VFS group and 29 (55. 8 %) in the VFS group during sclerotherapy (p =  0. 097). At 6 -month follow-up, complete occlusion was found in 23 limbs (45. 1 %) treated with UGFS + VFS and in 22 limbs (42. 3 %) treated with VFS. The {{difference between the two groups}} was not significant (p =  0. 775). Reflux was absent in 30 limbs (58. 8 %) treated with UGFS + VFS and in 37 (71. 2 %) treated with VFS (p =  0. 190). There was no inter-group difference in post-treatment VCSS (p =  0. 223). ConclusionsThese results show that UGFS + VFS and VFS are equally effective for the treatment of GSV reflux, despite the lower volume of foam used for VFS alone...|$|E

The urinary excretion of cotinine was normally distributed over a 2 h period (logarithmically transformed). Individuals with urinary cotinine levels in the ranges of 0. 01 - 0. 21, and 0. 52 - 94. 99 μg/ 2 h were categorized as poor metabolizes (PMs: 6. 5 %), and extensive metabolizers (EMs: 93. 5 %), respectively. The majority of EMs (45 %) carried homozygous wild-type genotypes (CYP 2 A 6 * 1 A/* 1 A, CYP 2 A 6 * 1 A/* 1 B and CYP 2 A 6 * 1 B/* 1 B), whereas only 1 % of PMs carried these genotypes. Markedly higher frequencies of EMs were also observed in all heterozygous defective genotypes including the null genotype (* 4 C/* 4 C; 1 subject). A weak but significant positive correlation was observed between <b>total</b> <b>amounts</b> of urinary cadmium excretion and total cotinine excretion over 2 h. Our study shows generally good agreement between CYP 2 A 6 genotypes and phenotypes. Smokers accumulated about 3 - 4 -fold higher <b>mean</b> <b>total</b> <b>amounts</b> of 2 -h urinary cadmium excretion (127. 5 ± 218. 2 ng/ 2 h) than that of non-smokers (40. 5 ± 78. 4 ng/ 2 h). Among the smokers (n = 16), homologous wild-type genotype * 1 /* 1 was significantly the predominant genotype (6 / 16) compared with other defective allele including * 4 C/* 4 C. In addition, 2 h urinary excretion of cotinine in smokers of all genotypes {{was significantly higher than}} non-smokers. The proportion of smokers who smoked more than 5 cigarettes/day was significantly higher in EMs in all CYP 2 A 6 genotypes (n = 14) than in PMs (n = 0) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{uniaxial}} compression response of manufactured sand mortars proportioned using different water-cement ratio and sand-cement ratio is examined. Pore structure parameters such as porosity, threshold diameter, <b>mean</b> diameter, and <b>total</b> <b>amounts</b> of macropores, {{as well as}} shape and size of micropores are quantified by using mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) technique. Test results indicate that strains at peak stress and compressive strength decreased with the increasing sand-cement ratio due to insufficient binders to wrap up entire sand. A compression stress-strain model of normal concrete extending to predict the stress-strain relationships of manufactured sand mortar is verified and agreed well with experimental data. Furthermore, the stress-strain model constant {{is found to be}} influenced by threshold diameter, mean diameter, shape, and size of micropores.

50|$|Next, {{imagine that}} the {{experimenter}} obtains a new, identical blood sample from the same patient. However, instead of placing the sample in a chamber with a PCO2 of 40 mmHg, the chamber is reset to a PCO2 of 60 mmHg. After equilibration, a new point is reached, indicating a new pH and a new bicarbonate concentration (Fig 5). Note that the bicarbonate concentration at the new, higher PCO2 is larger than in the first measurement, whereas the pH is now smaller. Neither result should come as a surprise. Increasing the PCO2 <b>means</b> that the <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> of {{carbon dioxide in the}} system has increased. Because the gaseous carbon dioxide is in equilibrium with the carbon dioxide derivatives in the solution, the concentrations of carbon dioxide derivatives, including bicarbonate, should also increase. The fall in pH is also not surprising, since the formation of a bicarbonate molecule is concomitant with the release of a proton (see Fig. 1).|$|R

DESIGN [...] This was a retrospective analysis of hospital discharge registry data, linked to meteorological data for the same period. SETTING [...] The study was a national survey using hospital discharge data {{for the whole of}} Finland over a 10 year period. PARTICIPANTS [...] All subjects with the acute closed angle glaucoma diagnosis from the hospital discharge registry were collected for the years 1972 to 1982. A total of 1796 patients were found. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] Meteorological data from two cities in Finland, Helsinki and Oulu, were collected for the same years from the Finnish Meteorological Institute. A peak incidence of acute closed angle glaucoma was noted whenever the number of hours without sunshine increased. A regression analysis including incidence of acute closed angle glaucoma as a dependent variable, and sex, mean temperature, mean air pressure, <b>mean</b> humidity, <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> of rain per month, and mean sunshine hours as independent variables, was constructed. Sex and sunshine hours best explained the variation in incidence in a covariate model. No other meteorological variate could improve the model fit.
