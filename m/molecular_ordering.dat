50|$|The thermal {{characteristics}} of polymers are {{fundamentally different from}} those of most solid materials.

Below the Tm, but still above the Tg, the polymer chains lose some of their long-range mobility and can form either crystalline or amorphous regions. In this temperature range, as the temperature decreases, amorphous regions can transition into crystalline regions, causing the bulk material to become more crystalline over all. Below the Tg, molecular motion is stopped and the polymer chains are essentially frozen in place. In this temperature range, amorphous regions can no longer transition into crystalline regions, and the polymer as a whole has reached its maximum crystallinity.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the molecular interaction of poly(3 -hexylthiophene- 2, 5 -diyl) (P 3 HT) molecules with polar functional {{groups of the}} dielectric surface, and its dependence on the regioregularity of P 3 HT. With this aim, we consider thickness-dependent <b>molecular</b> <b>order</b> of 100 % regioregular defect-free P 3 HT (DF-P 3 HT) and 93 % regioregular P 3 HT (LT-P 3 HT), deposited on top of cross-linked poly(vinyl alcohol) (cr-PVA) substrates. Intimate contact of P 3 HT molecules and cr-PVA surface defects affects the <b>molecular</b> <b>order</b> of P 3 HT differently, depending on the regioregularity. Consequently, these <b>molecular</b> <b>order</b> changes on the charge transport properties of organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) are investigated using four thicknesses (20, 40, 80 and 120 nm) of P 3 HT. As compared to other thicknesses, mu(sat) for 20 nm DF-P 3 HT OFETs shows further improvement, while the opposite occurs for 20 nm LT-P 3 HT OFETs. Depending on the regioregularity (and thus the chain orientation), P 3 HT molecules exhibit a difference in dipole moments. Consequently, the interaction of edge-on or face-on P 3 HT molecules with cr-PVA surface dipoles has different contributions towards the electrostatic energetic disorder at crPVA/P 3 HT interface.
