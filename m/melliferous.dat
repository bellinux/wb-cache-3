Due to their high protein contents, Crotalaria longirostrata and Crotalaria pumila were further studied to observe potential improvements in the diets of those who consume it. In an experiment, this species of plant was collected in 5 communities of the state of Veracruz. In comparing the relative protein content of each plant, {{it was found that the}} cultivated plants with the largest leaves were the most protein-rich, while the plants with the smallest leaves had the least amount of protein. This has important agricultural implications because these plants can be selected specifically for larger leaves in order to yield maximal protein content. Both of these plants are also considered to be valuable genetic resources, and studies suggest that they co-evolved within certain geographic regions. To affirm this, a cytological study between the two species was conducted, and it was found that their chromosomes are very similar in shape and size.

40|$|Background: Honey {{and honey}} based-products {{have a long}} {{tradition}} as a food source in Uzbekistan. The <b>melliferous</b> flora {{is one of the}} main resources for honey production. In this study, we present a review of some honey-based foods made in Uzbekistan and on the current state of the wild <b>melliferous</b> flora of Karakalpakstan, which is located in the northwestern part of Uzbekistan. This is the first such statistical study in a region in Uzbekistan after nearly 30 years. Methods: Field studies were carried out between 2013 and 2015. The <b>melliferous</b> plants were collected on territory of Karakalpakstan. More than 450 samples of plants have been collected from this region. Results: According to the literature, in 1978, there were 68 species of <b>melliferous</b> plants belonged to 32 genera of 19 families. In this study on the territory of Karakalpakstan, we found 206 species of wild vascular plants, which belonged to 134 genera of 46 families, that have commercial value for beekeeping. Among the 206 species of wild <b>melliferous</b> plants identified, 196 species are considered to have medicinal properties. An analysis of 13 leading families containing five or more types of <b>melliferous</b> plants showed that these families comprise 72. 05 % of the total <b>melliferous</b> flora. Discussion: The obtained data on the sequence of flowering of wild <b>melliferous</b> plants show that the vegetation period starts from March. After June, the bees start to collect honey from the cultivated species. These data suggest that the <b>melliferous</b> flora of Karakalpakstan has a fairly powerful resource base, which with a right approach can help us to get dozens of tons of high-quality, environmentally friendly honey, catering to all needs of Uzbekistan...|$|E

As concerns pollen characteristics inter and intra families variations were recorded. The smallest pollen size (15. 7 ± 1. 6 μ) {{was found with}} Leucaena leucocephala while Calliandra callothyrsus had the highest (190. 9 ± 7. 1 μ).

40|$|The {{individual}} and community-level <b>melliferous</b> potential of apiflora was evaluated in southwestern Vojvodina {{in order to}} assess its significance and contribution to the bee pasture. Seven plant communities belonging to ruderal, segetal and floodplain type of vegetation, with a total of 279 plant species were registered. Apifloristic and phytocoenological investigations included the determination and analysis of honey plants using the following parameters: total number, percentage, abundance and frequency of these species in the communities, as well as their intensity of pollen and nectar production. The coenotic coefficient of melliferousness (CCm) indicating the <b>melliferous</b> potential of each community, was calculated based on the above parameters. Although the greatest number of <b>melliferous</b> species was found in the ass. Chenopodio-Ambrosietum artemisiifoliae (132), the highest percentage (80 %) of them was registered in the ass. Consolido-Polygonetum avicularis. Considering the coefficients of nectar and pollen production, the most valuable honey plants commonly present in the majority of communities were: Cirsium arvense, Rubus caesius, Lythrum salicaria, Daucus carota, Trifolium pratense, Dipsacus laciniatus, Medicago sativa, Asclepias syriaca, Cichorium intybus and Taraxacum officinale. The low abundance and frequency of <b>melliferous</b> species within the Consolido-Polygonetum avicularis, Polygonetum convolvulo-avicularis and Populetum nigrae-albae communities indicated their poor contribution to the bee pasture.

Therefore perennial plants constitute the most reliable bio materials for determining and evaluating the beekeeping regions of the Republic of Benin. A silvo-melliferous region (S-MR) is a geographical area characterised by a particular set of homogenous <b>melliferous</b> plants that can produce timber. Using both the prevailing climatic and the agro-ecological conditions six S-MRs could be identified, i. e. the South region, the Common Central region, the Central West region, the Central North region, the Middle North region and the Extreme North region. At the country level, the <b>melliferous</b> plants were dominated by Vitellaria paradoxa which is common to all regions. The most diversified family was the Caesalpiniaceae (12 species) followed by the Combretaceae (10 species) and Combretum being the richest genus.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to develop a}} method to predict the honey production of an apiary by means of landscape variables. A model was built using attractivity and productivity formulae based upon the flowering periods, the distances to the apiary, and the density and specific nectar productivity of the floral species surrounding the apiary. Honey harvests of 12 apiaries in Wallonie, Belgium (Fig. 1), were recorded from 1998 to 2000. The plant species, location and absolute percentage of cover of nectar-producing (<b>melliferous)</b> plants within a radius of two km of each apiary were surveyed during the summer 2000. These data were encoded and geo-referenced with a Geographical Information System (GIS). This software used tables containing data from field survey and the theoretical <b>melliferous</b> potentials of encountered plants (Tab. I). The model brought out the listing of foraged flowers and their potential honey productivity during flowering periods for each foraging area studied (e. g. Fig. 3). The predictions of honey production (kg/hive/year) were compared to the actual production and the model explained 60 % of the variance of the observations (F- 1,F- 10 = 37. 76; P < 0. 001; r(2) = 0. 60; Fig. 2). Some tests of the sensitivity of the results to changing parameters showed the importance of a minimal 2 -km radius to model the foraging range (Tab. II). Taking into account landscape diversity, the abundance of areas containing dense <b>melliferous</b> flora was also essential. This work improves our understanding of the <b>melliferous</b> value of the landscape around an apiary.

Higher nectar production and lower sugar concentration were recorded in L. maculatum and L. galeobdolon grown in the forest, while for A. reptans in the same habitat, lower intensity of nectar secretion and higher sugar concentration were obtained. With regard to the average number of open flowers per plant during the nectar collecting day, total daily nectar volume per plant was the highest in L. maculatum (average volume 30. 1 ml/plant).

40|$|Most of the Lathyrus {{species of}} the Vojvodina Province arc {{cultivated}} for fodder. They are protein-containing herbs which easily recover after grazing. Some perennial species survive in grassland communities for ten years or more. Certain species are important <b>melliferous</b> plants. In the Vojvodina Province, they inhabit different habitats like forests and grasslands, dry and wet sites, thus showing a wide distribution range. Besides their floristic and vegetation aspects, their role as green and dry fodder crops should be emphasized...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of determinations of some physiological parameters (water content, dry matter, total mineral elements, assimilating pigments, cellular liquid concentration) in the seven spontaneous species with economic value (forage, medicinal and <b>melliferous</b> value). The analyzed species are characterized by a high content of water and assimilating pigments, a low concentration of cellular liquid and a good capacity of exploiting the mineral elements of the soils, presented through an appreciable content of total mineral elements...|$|E
