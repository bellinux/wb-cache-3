60|$|The {{years that}} {{followed}} {{the close of the}} Napoleonic wars in 1815 were in many senses years of unexampled misery. The accumulated burden of the war lay heavy upon Europe. The rise of the new <b>machine</b> <b>power</b> had dislocated the older system. A multitude of landless men clamored for bread and work. Pauperism spread like a plague. Each new invention threw thousands of hand-workers out of employment. The law still branded as conspiracy any united attempt of workingmen to raise wages or to shorten the hours of work. At the very moment when the coming of steam power and the use of modern machinery were piling up industrial fortunes undreamed of before, destitution, pauperism and unemployment seemed more widespread and more ominous than ever. In this rank atmosphere germinated modern socialism. The writings of Marx and Engels and Louis Blanc were inspired by what they saw about them.|$|E

This is {{probably}} {{attributable to the}} larger number of grinding steps when grinding with finer (280 # and 400 #) grit size abrasives, which introduces more accumulated heat on the surface, thus the increased thermal effect plus the decreased mechanical effect led to higher tensile residual stresses in the surface. The trend of the surface residual stresses with different <b>machining</b> <b>powers</b> is very obvious. A higher <b>machining</b> <b>power</b> increased the grinding temperature; but both the microstructure investigation and the FWHM {{results showed that the}} deformation of the surface and the sub-surface layer are similar at different used <b>machining</b> <b>powers.</b> Thus, an increasing thermal effect can be considered as the main factor that introduces higher tensile residual stresses, both parallel and perpendicular to the grinding directions when grinding at a higher <b>machining</b> <b>power.</b> Using grinding lubrication decreased both surface deformations and heat from the grinding operation; however, the decreased surface tensile (σ [...]...|$|R

At the same time, the “Müllenbacher Dachschieferwerk” built a railway powered by a diesel engine, which transported slates out of the Kaulenbach valley and up the steep Kaulenberg.|$|E
50|$|The machine had {{a simple}} task to perform. Essentially, the {{requirement}} was {{to cut a}} trench with a section of about six feet (2 m) square and for this some sort of cutter was required. Correctly estimating the power required to perform this feat was essential {{to the success of}} the project, but the nearest comparable machine the designers could take figures from were the giant bucket and chain excavators used in Germany for open cast mining of lignite. The key feature of such machines was that the cutting was a continuous process that required a fairly constant power and from this comparison the trenching <b>machine</b> <b>power</b> requirement was estimated at about 1,000 hp half of which was for cutting and half for driving the machine forward.|$|E

50|$|Laboratory {{investigations}} of the stability of multiple-machine systems were constrained {{by the use of}} direct-operated indicating instruments (voltmeters, ammeters, and wattmeters). To ensure that the instruments negligibly loaded the model system, the <b>machine</b> <b>power</b> level used was substantial. Some workers in the 1920s used three-phase model generators rated up to 600 kVA and 2300 volts to represent a power system. General Electric developed model systems using generators rated at 3.75 kVA. It was difficult to keep multiple generators in synchronism, and the size and cost of the units was a constraint. While transmission lines and loads could be accurately scaled down to laboratory representations, rotating machines could not be accurately miniaturized and keep the same dynamic characteristics as full-sized prototypes; the ratio of machine inertia to machine frictional loss did not scale.|$|E
5000|$|His many {{diplomatic}} {{activities in}} the third world led him to reflect on the development, particularly on poverty. He comes to distinguish the [...] "poverty" [...] (lifestyle based on moderation, which may be voluntary cf. Voluntary simplicity) of the [...] "misery" [...] (lack of access to livelihood). The reflection of twenty years will lead to the publication of his book When poverty forces Poverty (2003). In this book, the author summarizes his approach: [...] The spread of widespread misery and poverty is a social scandal obviously unacceptable, especially in companies perfectly capable of avoiding it. And the visceral rebellion it provokes in us is quite understandable and justified. But this is not by increasing the <b>machine</b> <b>power</b> to create goods and hardware products that this scandal will end, because the machine put into operation this effect is the same one that consistently produces misery.|$|E
50|$|Livestock {{provide a}} variety of food and nonfood products; the latter include leather, wool, pharmaceuticals, bone products, {{industrial}} protein, and fats. For many abattoirs, very little animal biomass may be wasted at slaughter. Even intestinal contents removed at slaughter may be recovered for use as fertilizer. Livestock manure helps maintain the fertility of grazing lands. Manure is commonly collected from barns and feeding areas to fertilize cropland. In some places, animal manure is used as fuel, either directly (as in some developing countries), or indirectly (as a source of methane for heating or for generating electricity). In regions where <b>machine</b> <b>power</b> is limited, some classes of livestock are used as draft stock, not only for tillage and other on-farm use, but also for transport of people and goods. In 1997, livestock provided energy for between an estimated 25 and 64% of cultivation energy in the world's irrigated systems, and that 300 million draft animals were used globally in small-scale agriculture.|$|E

The targets have been changed and researchers are looking at materials such as IZO (Indium Zinc Oxide), ITO (Indium Tin Oxide) and AZO (Aluminum Zinc Oxide), and they are optimizing these materials by changing parameters within the sputtering deposition machine. When researchers vary parameters such as concentration of the gases within the sputtering, the pressure within the sputtering <b>machine,</b> <b>power</b> of the sputtering, and pressure, {{they are able to}} achieve different carrier concentrations and sheet resistivities within the machine.

50|$|This date's back to 1658 {{when the}} crop was {{established}} as a viable one. Since then, the industry has progressed from periods of manuals and animal power to <b>machine</b> <b>power</b> and electronic equipment. The government of Guyana restructured the sugar industry in the mid-1980s to restore its profitability. The area dedicated to sugar production was reduced from 50,000 hectares to under 40,000 hectares, and two of ten sugarcane-processing mills were closed. GuySuCo also diversified into production of dairy products, livestock, citrus, and other items. Profitability improved, but production levels and export earnings remained well below target. In mid-1990, the government took an important step toward long-term reform of the sugar industry—and a symbolically important step toward opening the economy—when GuySuCo signed a management contract with the British firms Booker and Tate & Lyle. The Booker company owned most sugar plantations in Guyana until the industry was nationalized in 1976. A study by the two companies reportedly estimated that US$20 million {{would be needed to}} rehabilitate Guyana's sugar industry.|$|E
5000|$|George Brough {{considered}} the four-cylinder engine ideal for a motorcycle, given its smooth running and potential for greater horsepower {{than a single}} or twin-cylinder engine of the same capacity. Brough Superior had already revealed two prototype 4-cylinder machines before 1932, using an air-cooled sidevalve V-4 built in-house (1927), and an air-cooled inline sidevalve 4 developed by Motosacoche (1928). [...] While these prototypes were never built in series, they generated tremendous attention at shows and in the press [...] In 1930, George Brough considered using an engine already in production, {{in this case the}} well-developed Austin 4-cylinder sidevalve, water-cooled motor of 747cc. Brough increased the engine displacement by a 50 cc to 797 cc and added a light alloy 'sports' cylinder head for more horsepower. George Brough claimed {{a significant increase in the}} Austin's power output, but, as The Motor Cycle magazine observed, this was a luxury motorcycle intended for use with a sidecar, not a sports <b>machine.</b> <b>Power</b> output was actually quite low, and the performance was inhibited by the use of standard Austin rear-axle ratios. The brisk acceleration with a heavy sidecar fitted would, however, more than compensate for lack of top speed.|$|E
