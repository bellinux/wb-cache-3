500|$|During the film's {{pre-production}} at Paramount, Boorman cast Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton in {{the lead}} roles of Hank and Jacob Mitchell, respectively. A Simple Plan marked the second on-screen collaboration between Paxton and Thornton after One False Move (1992). Thornton recalled, [...] "I {{got a call from}} one of my agents who said, 'John Boorman wants you to do a script that I sent you a year ago and you never read,' I said, 'Send it to <b>me</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> this time I'll really read it.' Within the first two pages, I knew I wanted to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} section of the song, the protagonist (Will Estes [...] )sees the ghost of the plane fly over the {{graveyard}} at Kenny's funeral. Synchronic with the lyrics relating to [...] "winter" [...] ("freeze"; [...] "no leaves on the trees") in this verse, some of the mise-en-scene is minimal. It shows his father as a family man during the day but an abusive alcoholic all the time. The line [...] "He hit <b>me</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> again, and again" [...] {{is accompanied by a}} baseball scene, rather than visually depicting the violence of [...] "hit" [...] that the autobiographical elements suggest.|$|E
500|$|Schembechler later {{recalled}} that he remained loyal to Elliott {{when he took}} over as Michigan's head coach in 1969. [...] When Schembechler won the Big Ten championship in 1969, he said, [...] "I made certain I let everyone know I won with Bump's kids. [...] Bump was a man of great class and he showed it to <b>me</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> again in that first year, never getting in the way, always trying to be helpful, always trying to encourage me." [...] After Michigan won the 1969 Ohio State game, the team presented the game ball to Elliott, and Schembechler noted that [...] "I don’t remember when I felt happier about anything in my life." ...|$|E

500|$|Winrich Kolbe, the {{director}} of [...] "Caretaker", was involved in casting the main cast for the series. He described the casting process for the part of Chakotay as difficult due to the lower numbers of Native Americans {{who were in the}} Screen Actors Guild. The casting process came down to two actors, and the producers decided on Robert Beltran, who until then was best known for appearing in the soap opera Models Inc. and was of Mexican heritage. Beltran was not familiar with Star Trek before auditioning, and went along on the strength of the [...] "Caretaker" [...] script which showed the character becoming the second in command of Voyager after both their vessels are stranded in the Delta quadrant. Beltran explained the audition experience, [...] "I felt neutral about the audition, didn't much care one way or the other. I went in the first time and wasn't really trying to get the part. They asked to see <b>me</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> they wanted to see more of an edge to the character." ...|$|E
500|$|A major effect {{required}} {{throughout the}} episode was face replacements, {{especially during the}} 'May vs. May' fight where it had to appear as if Wen was fighting herself. All the effects were completed in the two weeks between the filming and airing of the episode. Wen noted that [...] "Kevin Tancharoen directed [...] and he’s amazing with his directing with the Mortal Kombat series. So we had this really complicated sequence where we do this 360 and it reveals me and it reveals <b>me</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> there’s no cut and you wonder how that happens {{in one of the}} fight sequences. And that’s because they completely scanned and CGIed my face onto the stunt double. So there’s a tremendous amount of work that went into the fight scenes and we did not {{have a lot of time}} to do it." [...] She also elaborated that [...] "On the day of, you have the set and you have the cameras, and you have to deal with special effects, because on top of everything else we had to scan my face and go through this incredible process of taking a million pictures so they were able to meld it onto Sam’s face." ...|$|E

After a remark from Klein, Philippoussis was quoted as saying, [...] "You say that to <b>me</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> you're in trouble; you're not playing juniors any more." [...] He came out the victor in straight sets, 6–3, 7–5, and thus began his comeback in good form. Philippoussis then lost his second match to Sam Groth, 4-6, 3-6, but due to other players' injuries, he advanced to the quarterfinals, where he was to play Rameez Junaid. However, due to another knee injury requiring surgery, Philippoussis was unable to play.|$|E

[...] McQueen recalls him being [...] "a prime {{son of a}} bitch" [...] who was not averse to using his fists on McQueen and his mother. As McQueen began to rebel again he {{was sent back to}} live with Claude a final time. At age 14 he left Claude's farm without saying goodbye and joined a circus for a short time, then drifted back to his mother and stepfather in Los Angeles, resuming his life as a gang member and petty criminal. McQueen was caught stealing hubcaps by police, who handed him over to his stepfather, who beat him severely, ending the fight by throwing McQueen down a flight of stairs.

2500|$|In December 1948 Sal {{is celebrating}} Christmas with his {{relatives}} in Testament, Virginia, when Dean shows up with Marylou (having left his second wife, Camille, and their newborn baby, Amy, in San Francisco) and Ed Dunkel. Sal's Christmas plans are shattered as [...] "now the bug was on <b>me</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> the bug's name was Dean Moriarty." [...] First they drive to New York, where they meet Carlo and party. Dean wants Sal {{to make love}} to Marylou, but Sal declines. In Dean's Hudson they take off from New York in January 1949 and make it to New Orleans. In Algiers they stay with the morphine-addicted Old Bull Lee and his wife Jane.

Both of them stay briefly in a hotel, but soon she moves out, following a nightclub owner. Sal is alone and on Market Street has visions of past lives, birth, and rebirth. Dean finds him and invites him to stay with his family. Together, they visit nightclubs and listen to Slim Gaillard and other jazz musicians. The stay ends on a sour note: [...] "what I accomplished by coming to Frisco I don't know," [...] and Sal departs, taking the bus back to New York.|$|E
2500|$|The {{condemned}} men approach, led by Eustachio who {{hands over}} the keys of Calais to the king; he declares [...] that they serve as an example to the others, but Eustachio stands firm declaring that a glorious death is waiting. [...] Just then, there is noise from outside and Eleonora is heard addressing the townspeople. As Edoardo attempts to have his men remove the relatives of the victims who have gathered outside, Queen Isabella hurries in, having heard the orders. [...] Along with the victims and their families, she pleads with her husband, but, with the king's stolid rejections, Eustachio steps forward to declare that the six must now accept their fate and say their farewells to their families. Aurelio attempts to hold back his tears as he says goodbye to his young son and to Eleonora, but he finally breaks down with his son in his arms: (Aurelio: Raddopia i baci tuoi, Parte di me piu cara... / [...] "Dearest part of me, Kiss <b>me</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> again..."; then Eleonora, Eustachio, and the hostages; then the queen - all join together).
