40|$|International audienceThe {{specific}} down-regulation triggered through interference RNA (RNAi) {{provides a}} means to determine the gene functions and their contributions in an altered phenotype. In this way, high throughput screening (HTS) {{has emerged as a}} potent automated tool to study a large number of genes for identification of new biomarkers and therapeutic targets. However, the siRNA-mediated gene knock down requires that siRNA can reach cytoplasm compartment where RNAi occurs. Unfortunately, the siRNA is relatively vulnerable in the extracellular environment due to the presence of degradation enzymes and its high molecular weight associated to its anionic charge limit considerably its cell incorporation across the plasma membrane. Thereby, HTS requires generic carriers with highly efficient siRNA transfection. To overcome these obstacles, multifunctional nanoparticles comprising an imaging contrast agent are emerging as an original and promising approach in the improved, controlled and <b>monitored</b> <b>delivery</b> of siRNA...|$|E
40|$|Thanks to {{the recent}} {{advances}} {{in the development of}} chemotherapeutics, the morbidity and mortality of many cancers has decreased significantly. However, compared to oncology in general, the field of neuro-oncology has lagged behind. While new molecularly targeted chemotherapeutics have emerged, the impermeability of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) renders systemic delivery of these clinical agents suboptimal. To circumvent the BBB, novel routes of administration are being applied in the clinic, ranging from intra-arterial infusion and direct infusion into the target tissue (convection enhanced delivery (CED)) to the use of focused ultrasound to temporarily disrupt the BBB. However, the current system depends on a “wait-and-see” approach, whereby drug delivery is deemed successful only when a specific clinical outcome is observed. The shortcomings of this approach are evident, as a failed delivery that needs immediate refinement cannot be observed and corrected. In response to this problem, new theranostic agents, compounds with both imaging and therapeutic potential, are being developed, paving the way for improved and <b>monitored</b> <b>delivery</b> to central nervous system (CNS) malignancies. In this review, we focus on the advances and the challenges to improve early cancer detection, selection of targeted therapy, and evaluation of therapeutic efficacy, brought forth by the development of these new agents...|$|E
40|$|The HEALTHY primary {{prevention}} trial {{was designed to}} reduce risk factors for type 2 diabetes in middle school students. Middle schools at seven centers across the United States participated in the 3 -year study. Half of them were randomized to receive a multi-component intervention. The intervention integrated nutrition, physical education (PE) and behavior changes with a communications strategy of promotional and educational materials and activities. The PE intervention component was developed over a series of pilot studies to maximize student participation and the time (in minutes) spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), while meeting state-mandated PE guidelines. The goal of the PE intervention component was to achieve X 150 min of MVPA in PE classes every 10 school days {{with the expectation that}} it would provide a direct effect on adiposity and insulin resistance, subsequently reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes in youth. The PE intervention component curriculum used standard lesson plans to provide a comprehensive approach to middle school PE. Equipment and PE teacher assistants were provided for each school. An expert in PE at each center trained the PE teachers and assistants, <b>monitored</b> <b>delivery</b> of the intervention and provided ongoing feedback and guidance.

40|$|Mutations in {{the gene}} for dysferlin cause a {{degenerative}} disorder of skeletal muscle known as limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2 B. To achieve gene delivery of plasmids encoding dysferlin to hind limb muscles of dysferlin knockout mice, we used a vascular injection method that perfused naked plasmid DNA into all major muscle groups of the hind limb. We <b>monitored</b> <b>delivery</b> by luciferase live imaging and western blot, confirming strong dysferlin expression that persisted over the 3 -month time course of the experiment. Co-delivery of the follistatin gene, which may promote muscle growth, was monitored by ELISA. Immunohistochemistry documented the presence of dysferlin in muscle fibers in treated limbs, and PCR confirmed the presence of plasmid DNA. Because dysferlin is involved in repair of the sarcolemmal membrane, dysferlin loss leads to fragile sarcolemmal membranes that can be detected by permeability to Evan’s blue dye. We showed that after gene therapy with a plasmid encoding both dysferlin and follistatin, statistically significant reduction in Evan’s blue dye permeability was present in hamstring muscles. These results suggest that vascular delivery of plasmids carrying these therapeutic genes may lead to simple and effective approaches for improving the clinical condition of limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2 B...|$|E
40|$|Intrauterine {{fetal death}} is a serious medical and nursing problem. Midwifes in the {{delivery}} room do not come across this diagnosis often, so the women in labour should be looked after by sufficiently experienced and educated midwives, who are well aware of the problem and are able to satisfy the needs of the woman in all its complexity. The theoretical part of the Study describes the causes of intrauterine fetal death, the symptoms, the complications, the diagnostical and therapeutical procedures. From the nursing point of view the Study focuses on midwives? care of the woman prior to the delivery, during labour, in the puerperium and in the subsequent ambulatory care. It also deals with the importance of farewell ritual with the child and with the psycho-social aspects of this problem. I have included a chapter on civil legal requirements that arise from this situation. The aim of this Study was to compare nursing care of women with stillbirth in selected maternity hospitals. I compare the midwives´ approach, ways and means of saying goodbye to the child and try to ascertain the level of awareness of the legal requirements relating to this situation amongst the midwives. Qualitative methodological approach was selected for the research. The investigation was conducted through semi-structured non-directive interviews. The results of the interviews were processed, analyzed and arranged into transparent schemes with a description. The research group consists of eight respondents from five different workplaces. The respondents were selected on the condition that they had been working {{in the delivery room}} and have experience with the care of a woman with stillbirth. Upon completing this research, the first research question could be answered. The nursing care of the woman with stillbirth is in all the facilities comparable. The midwife monitors the condition of the woman in labour and the course of the labour. All facilities make an effort to ensure the woman?s privacy, allow the partner?s presence and focus on good analgesia. Empathetic and sensitive approach to the woman is matter of course. The second research question was also answered. It was established that the farewell with the child is not facilitated in most of the <b>monitored</b> <b>delivery</b> rooms. At most workplaces the midwives do not actively offer the farewell with the child to the woman although they believe that this ritual bears great importance. The third research question can be answered that the midwives? awareness of the civil legal formalities in this area is not very high. Almost all respondents knew about the possibility to name and bury the stillborn child, but the midwives? knowledge about the maternity benefits and death allowance is not sufficient. The results of the research show {{that it is important to}} focus on improving the awareness of midwives in the care of a woman with stillbirth. The solution would be to organize a seminar on this topic. In the seminar, the midwives would acquaint themselves with the appropriate approach to the woman in labour, the possibilities of communication, about the importance of the farewell ritual with the child, the possible ways of this ritual and the information about the naming, burial and the maternity benefit. Another suitable method would be to create a training leaflet that would summarize the basic information related to this issue. This work could contribute to raising awareness amongst the midwives and thereby women in labour would receive not only professional care of their basic biological needs but also the adequate support in the psycho-social field. Midwives would become competent accompanying persons in this, for the woman very challenging time of life...|$|E

40|$|Many {{biomedical}} applications necessitate {{a targeted}} intracellular {{delivery of the}} nanomaterial to specific cells. Therefore, a non-invasive and reliable imaging tool is required to detect both the delivery and cellular endocytosis of the nanoparticles. Herein, we demonstrate that magneto-photo-acoustic (MPA) imaging {{can be used to}} <b>monitor</b> the <b>delivery</b> and to identify endocytosis of magnetic and optically absorbing nanoparticles. The relationship between photoacoustic (PA) and magneto-motive ultrasound (MMUS) signals from the in vitro samples were analyzed to identify the delivery and endocytosis of nanoparticles. The results indicated that during the delivery of nanoparticles to the vicinity of the cells, both PA and MMUS signals are almost linearly proportional. However, accumulation of nanoparticles within the cells leads to nonlinear MMUS-PA relationship, due to non-linear MMUS signal amplification. Therefore, through longitudinal MPA imaging, it is possible to <b>monitor</b> the <b>delivery</b> of nanoparticles and identify the endocytosis of the nanoparticles by living cells...|$|R
