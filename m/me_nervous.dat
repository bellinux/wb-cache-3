500|$|Peter and I usually write very quickly. It's {{usually a}} day or two a song, but for some reason this didn't really hit us as a hit song. We didn't give up on it. We just kept working on it {{over the course of a}} year. Thank God we did. [...] It was the first song that was cut on the True Blue album. It made <b>me</b> <b>nervous</b> as a writer, because a lot of times the very first song that gets cut doesn't make it in the long run. But the song ended up making the album, which really opened up a lot of doors for me.|$|E

6000|$|CECILY, IMPLORINGLY:--"(Dan, do stop. You make <b>me</b> so <b>nervous</b> I don't {{know what}} I'm doing.) This is Mr. Lemuel Goodridge. He is a minister." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wow!" [...] {{said the}} Cowardly Lion, with a shudder. [...] "It makes <b>me</b> dreadfully <b>nervous</b> {{to see that}} big hammer {{pounding}} so near my head. One blow would crush me into a door-mat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I confess, {{he makes}} <b>me</b> <b>nervous</b> around the children," [...] she said. [...] "I have a dread {{that he will}} turn upon them {{unexpectedly}} some day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "George, I {{will not}} sleep {{here in this}} room alone. You must make up a cot-bed or something. These people make <b>me</b> <b>nervous,</b> with their guns and Mexican servants." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dearest, don't mention governesses; {{the word}} makes <b>me</b> <b>nervous.</b> I have {{suffered}} a martyrdom from their incompetency and caprice. I thank Heaven I have now done with them!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} man, [...] "I never did. But {{it would be}} a dreadful thing, wouldn't it? And the thought of it makes <b>me</b> so <b>nervous</b> I'm afraid to go to sleep." ...|$|R
60|$|Gwendolen. Pray don't talk to {{me about}} the weather, Mr. Worthing. Whenever people {{talk to me}} about the weather, I always feel quite certain that they mean {{something}} else. And that makes <b>me</b> so <b>nervous.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I am very glad," [...] she answered. [...] "Do {{you know}} that you made <b>me</b> wretchedly <b>nervous?</b> I was told just as I was going on that you had come to smash us all to atoms in that terrible Day." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It's {{the only}} thing to do," [...] {{answered}} Giant. [...] "Come on," [...] he added. [...] "Staying here is making <b>me</b> <b>nervous.</b> If another tree should come down we might be buried alive." ...|$|E
60|$|My mother's {{historical}} knowledge, and {{the unique}} example of provident and exhaustive equipment which she cited, reduced me to silence, {{but did not}} diminish my anxiety. The delay made <b>me</b> <b>nervous,</b> excited, and chippy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Heaven above us!" [...] {{said the}} Inquisitor, [...] "what a great hairy ruffian; it makes <b>me</b> feel <b>nervous</b> {{to be in}} the same place with him. I beg you, Governor Ramiro, {{instruct}} your soldiers to be watching and to stab him at the first movement." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very {{trying for}} your nerves. I {{know what it}} is. We're {{different}} from the last generation; they thought nothing of it. When Charles was born my dear old father was out hunting all day. When my wife had George, it made <b>me</b> as <b>nervous</b> as a cat!" ...|$|R
60|$|CHARTERIS (fidgeting about). I can't sit down: I'm too restless. The fact is, Julia {{has made}} <b>me</b> so <b>nervous</b> that I can't answer for myself until I know her decision.

6000|$|... 'Yes, I am I know,' said Tom; 'but you'll make <b>me</b> <b>nervous</b> if {{you tell}} me so. I'm afraid you have put me out a little now, for I forget what I was going to say.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did," [...] replied Hank. [...] "One minute I {{was outside}} of Oz--and {{the next minute}} I was inside! That was enough to give <b>me</b> a <b>nervous</b> shock, as you may guess; but to find myself able to talk, as Betsy does, is a marvel that {{staggers}} me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's NOT the cabbages, Mr. Harrison. I'll {{tell you}} {{everything}} [...] . that is what I came for--but please don't interrupt me. It makes <b>me</b> so <b>nervous.</b> Just let <b>me</b> tell my story and don't say anything till I get through--and then no doubt you'll say plenty," [...] Anne concluded, but in thought only.|$|R

6000|$|... "Not a soul. She came {{up like a}} ghost, {{with only}} two lights showing, {{and by the time}} I had backed and turned she was gone. But it nearly gave <b>me</b> <b>nervous</b> collapse," [...] added the amateur pilot.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm just loco, that's all," [...] {{returned}} Pan, forcing himself. [...] "It's--such--such {{a disappointment}} not to see--her.... Made <b>me</b> <b>nervous.</b> Makes me think how anything might happen. I never trusted Jim Blake. And Lucy {{is only a}} kid in years." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} hear," [...] he continued, [...] "that you {{are holding}} such an {{important}} position. Clerk to the Military Defence Board, eh? Quite an important position, of course; {{but it might be}} made--yes, with care, it might be made," [...] he added, watching <b>me</b> with <b>nervous</b> alertness, [...] "a very lucrative one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you'd {{ameliorate}} our life, [...] Let each {{select from}} them a wife; [...] And as for <b>nervous</b> <b>me,</b> old pal, [...] Give me your own enchanting gal!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Feb. 4.--Ruminated on {{the dangers}} of my {{explanation}} right and [...] left, and it made <b>me</b> unusually <b>nervous.</b> H. of C. 4Â½-9. I was kindly [...] spoken of and heard, and I hope attained practically purposes I had [...] in view, but I think the House felt that the last part by taking [...] away the sting reduced the matter to flatness.|$|R

60|$|I {{often used}} to see her there, and when a chance {{occurred}} she would talk to me. It {{seemed to be a}} relief to her to use her own tongue, but it made <b>me</b> <b>nervous</b> at times for fear someone would hear her.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{think so}} now, because I am not {{appearing}} at my best. You see <b>me</b> <b>nervous,</b> diffident, tongue-tied.

6000|$|... 'A telegram! Make haste {{and open}} it, Jane; they always make <b>me</b> so <b>nervous!</b> I {{believe that is}} the reason Reginald always will {{telegraph}} when he is coming,' said Miss Adeline Mohun, a very pretty, well preserved, though delicate-looking lady of some age about forty, as her elder sister, brisk and lively and some years older, came into the room.|$|R
6000|$|... "It makes <b>me</b> a bit <b>nervous,</b> though," [...] Shepherd remarked apologetically. [...] "They're {{a regular}} keen-looking tribe, I can tell you. Their eyes seem to follow you {{all over the}} place." ...|$|R
