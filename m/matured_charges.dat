When hydrocarbon charges from the hydrocarbon kitchen arrive a reservoir, those gain access via {{a network of}} pores embedded in the matrix of the rocks or via fractures or faults, usually those bearing the lowest capillary entry pressure. The early arriving petroleum is usually {{in a series of}} fronts, depending on the reservoir dynamics, the arriving petroleum will occupy its position within the reservoir, later charges arriving will displace the earlier charges into reservoir (Larter and Aplin 1995). The earlier charges are generated and expelled from a less mature source rock in the kitchen, overtime as generation, expulsion and migration progresses the source rock in the kitchen undergoes subsidence and <b>matures,</b> hence later <b>charges</b> from the source rock into the reservoir are more <b>mature</b> than earlier <b>charges,</b> this results in lateral compositional variation and indeed subtle maturity differences expressed as a maturity gradient across the reservoir. The maturity gradient increases {{in the direction of the}} kitchen. Parameters such as GORs, biomarkers (maturity markers), water flow directions (n-alkane concentrations) and compositional step changes are employed for determining directions of source kitchens in basins (Larter and Aplin 1995).|$|R

A study performed using logistic regression analysis on data from the 1986 through 1994 American National Election Studies found that low-information voters tend to assume female and black candidates are more liberal than male and white candidates of the same party. A 2003 study that analyzed precinct-level data from city council elections held in Peoria, Illinois between 1983 and 1999 found that the placement of candidates' names on the ballot was a point of influence for low-information voters. An analysis concerned with the [...] "puzzling finding" [...] that incumbent legislators in <b>mature</b> democracies <b>charged</b> with corruption are not commonly punished in elections found that less-informed voters {{were significantly more likely to}} vote for incumbents accused of corruption than were their better-informed counterparts, presumably because they did not know about the allegations.|$|R
40|$|The {{concerns}} {{of greenhouse gas}} (GHG) emission from transport sector elevate the technological development and introduction of electric vehicle (EV). Internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles {{are one of the}} largest contributors of GHG emission. However EV does not emit any such pollutant gases therefore global acceptance of EVs are increasing with time. Moreover electricity required for EV is readily available and efficiently produced from different sources. Technology of EV is not <b>matured</b> yet, <b>charging</b> facility is limited and also there has been no worldwide accepted standard for EVs. The introduction of EV requires distribution power network to facilitate charging facility at different convenient spots. However {{it is important to understand}} the consequences and possible impacts on distribution network by the introduction of a good number of charging facility for this new technology EVs. Therefore this paper presents the potential impacts of EVs on the distribution network and addresses recommendations for possible remedies.

30|$|During {{the middle}} diagenetic stage B, the strata buried depth {{continued}} to increase and then slowly uplifted. The highest diagenetic temperature tended to be 120  °C (Fig.  13). As the organic matter was over <b>mature,</b> the hydrocarbons <b>charging</b> was significantly weakened. The diagenetic environment gradually transformed to weak alkaline. The Fe-carbonate cements began to form. Chlorite content was reduced corresponding to the intergranular precipitations of illite. The debris grains were in point-long or long contact. The residual intergranular pores, intergranular dissolved pores and intergranular dissolved pores are the main pore types of the reservoir. The porosity loss due to compaction {{was estimated to be}} 1.417 %. And the porosity loss caused by cementation was close to the late cements volume fraction which was about 5.35 %.

Upon incubation of post-ribosomal supernatants of the in vitro protein synthesis mixtures with purified intact chloroplasts, the pea and spinach precursors are transported interchangeably into the chloroplasts and processed to the <b>mature</b> size and <b>charge.</b> Moreover, the newly transported small subunits are found to assemble with endogenous large subunits to form the holoenzyme. In contrast, a {{precursor to}} the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii small subunit is not taken up by higher plant chloroplasts, indicating the specificity of the transport events. Together, these results demonstrate that the in vitro reconstruction of the post-translational transport of the higher plant precursors is physiologically significant...|$|R

During the trial, a psychiatrist testified that the film portrayed acts that were [...] "well {{within the bounds of}} normal behavior". A film critic testified the movie had social value because it showed sympathy for female desires, because the script contained humor and because it was filmed [...] "with clarity and lack of grain".

[...] On March 1, 1973, Judge Joel J. Tyler ruled Deep Throat to be obscene, issuing his opinion on the film as [...] "this feast of carrion and squalor", [...] "a nadir of decadence" [...] and [...] "a Sodom and Gomorrah gone wild before the fire". Judge Tyler fined Mature Enterprises $100,000, which was later reduced on appeal. The ruling would inadvertently contribute to the film becoming perhaps the most popular X rated movie of all time.|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{autonomous}} power systems in Greek islands are based {{almost entirely on}} imported expensive oil and experience high variation of demand between summer and winter due to tourism development. Local conventional power stations operate with low load factors and the systems are characterised by high electricity production cost. In parallel, wind energy is a <b>mature,</b> free of <b>charge,</b> local source, but wind penetration is restricted due to technical reasons related with the safe operation of {{the autonomous}} power systems. Combined use of wind energy with pumped storage systems (WHPS) is considered {{as a mean to}} exploit the abundant wind potential, increase the wind installed capacity and substitute conventional peak supply. In this study, the effect of wind energy on the reliability of the autonomous power systems is analysed. A definition of the WHPS capacity credit (CC) and a methodology for the calculation that is based on probability theory principles are proposed and applied in three representative Greek islands. The aim is to assess the prospects of wind energy with or without pumped storage systems to substitute the installation of conventional power plants. WHPS are evaluated through the improvement of the reliability of the system with reference to the required installed capacity. Results show that WHPS contributes beneficially to wind CC, besides the required large wind installed capacity. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2010...|$|R
40|$|Major {{parameters}} of the CLIC and ILC electron sources are given in Table I. It is shown that the CLIC source needs to provide 312 15 -ps-long 2 -GHz microbunches. There are two approaches to achieve the time structure [2]: one {{is to develop a}} 2 -GHz optical pulse train, and the other to develop a 156 -ns-long CW optical pulse and use an RF bunching system to generate 312 2 -GHz microbunches. The former scheme may ease the RF bunching system but still need it to bunch 100 -ps of microbunch down to 15 -ps level. Otherwise, a huge amount of energy spread is accumulated when the beam is accelerated through downstream 2 -GHz accelerator. In addition, in the former scheme, the space charge is high and surface charge is not yet proven in the parameter regime and 2 -GHz mode locked laser is challenging. The latter scheme needs a high-efficiency bunching system to generate 312 15 -ps microbunches with 2 -GHz repetition rate but it has some notable advantages: a 156 -ns CW laser technique is <b>matured,</b> and the <b>charge</b> limit behavior in the scheme is better characterized than that in the former case, as listed in the table. This note presents a design and modeling of the bunching system for the latter scheme to convert a 156 -ns CW pulse to 312 15 -ps long 2 -GHz microbunches...|$|R
40|$|Image sensors play a {{vital role}} in many image sensing and capture applications. Among the various types of image sensors, {{complementary}} metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) based active pixel sensors (APS), which are characterized by reduced pixel size, give fast readouts and reduced noise. APS are used in many applications such as mobile cameras, digital cameras, Webcams, and many consumer, commercial and scientific applications. With these developments and applications, CMOS APS designs are challenging the old and <b>mature</b> technology of <b>charged</b> couple device (CCD) sensors. With the continuous improvements of APS architecture, pixel designs, along with the development of nanometer CMOS fabrications technologies, APS are optimized for optical sensing. In addition, APS offers very low-power and low-voltage operations and is suitable for monolithic integration, thus allowing manufacturers to integrate more functionality on the array and building low-cost camera-on-a-chip. In this thesis, I explore the current state-of-the-art of CMOS APS by examining various types of APS. I show design and simulation results of one of the most commonly used APS in consumer applications, i. e. photodiode based APS. We also present an approach for technology scaling of the devices in photodiode APS to present CMOS technologies. Finally, I present the most modern CMOS APS technologies by reviewing different design models. The design of the photodiode APS is implemented using commercial CAD tools...|$|R
40|$|We analyze {{reputation}} {{dynamics in}} an online market for illicit drugs using a novel dataset of prices and ratings. The market is a black market, and so contracts cannot be enforced. We study the role that reputation plays in alleviating adverse selection in this market. We document the following stylized facts: (i) There is {{a positive relationship between}} the price and the rating of a seller. This effect is increasing in the number of reviews left for a seller. A <b>mature</b> highly-rated seller <b>charges</b> a 20 % higher price than a mature low-rated seller. (ii) Sellers with more reviews charge higher prices regardless of rating. (iii) Low-rated sellers are more likely to exit the market and make fewer sales. We show that these stylized facts are explained by a dynamic model of adverse selection, ratings, and exit, in which buyers form rational inferences about the quality of a seller jointly from his rating and number of sales. Sellers who receive low ratings initially charge the same price as highly-rated sellers since early reviews are less informative about quality. Bad sellers exit rather than face lower prices in the future. We provide conditions under which our model admits a unique equilibrium. We estimate the model, and use the result to compute the returns to reputation in the market. We find that the market would have collapsed due to adverse selection {{in the absence of a}} rating system...|$|R
500|$|Series writer Brian Peterson {{discusses}} how {{the writing}} staff chose {{to develop the}} character: [...] "In the Smallville pilot, Al and Miles established Lex and Clark as best friends, which is, to me, {{one of the best}} aspects of the show. So when you're introducing his future love interest, why not introduce her, not as an enemy, but as the one who is constantly going to butt heads with him, where they're not gonna like each other at all at first? I think that because we chose such a different take on her, it wasn't that intimidating. She could grow into the person that everybody sees on-screen later." [...] For season six, the writers chose to start Lois down the path of investigative journalism, only in this version of the character she gets her start working for a tabloid newspaper. Writer Kelly Souders felt that if tabloid beginnings were good enough for Perry White—an additional character established in season three's [...] "Perry"—then they are good enough for Lois Lane. It adds depth to the character by showing how she struggled before becoming [...] "the reporter we all know and love". As Lois steps closer to her ultimate destiny at the Daily Planet, the writers have continued to evolve the character by having her grow out of the [...] "black and white" [...] mindset and have her begin seeing shades of gray. The writers wanted the character to realize that there is sometimes a middle road that has to be taken. In season eight, Durance sees Clark taking a job at the Daily Planet as a chance for her character to [...] "step it up and be more involved". In this case, Lois is acting more <b>mature,</b> taking <b>charge</b> in being a mentor to Clark as he transitions into his new job. Durance describes the eighth season as a lesson in duality, with Clark realizing that he has to be two different people if he wants to have a life and save the day; Durance believes that the same applies to Lois.

40|$|For {{purposes}} ofthe Endangered Species Act (ESA), a "species" {{is defined}} to include "any distinct population segment of any species of vertebrate fish or wildlife which interbreeds when <b>mature.</b> "Federal agencies <b>charged</b> with {{carrying out the}} provisions of the ESA have struggled for over a decade to develop a consistent approach for interpreting the term "distinct population segment. " This paper outlines such an approach and explains in some detail how it can be applied to ESA evaluations of anadromous Pacific salmonids. The following definition is proposed: A population (or group of populations) will be considered "distinct" (and hence a "species ") for purposes of the ESA if it represents an evolutionarily significant unit (ESU) of the biological species. A population must satisfy two criteria to be considered an ESU: 1) It must be substantially reproductively isolated from other conspecific population units, and 2) It must represent an important component in the evolutionary legacy of the species. Isolation {{does not have to be}} absolute, but it must be strong enough to permit evolutionarily important differences to accrue in different population units. The second criterion would be met if the population contributes substantially to the ecological/genetic diversity of the species as a whole. Insights into the extent of reproductive isolation can be provided by movements of tagged fish, natural recolonization rates observed in other populations, measurements of genetic differences between populations, and evaluations of the efficacy of natural barriers. Each of these methods has its limitations. Identification of physical barriers to genetic exchange can help define the geographic extent of distinct populations, but reliance on physical features alone can be misleading in the absence of supporting biological information. Physical tags provide information about the movements of individual fish but not the genetic consequences of migration. Furthermore, measurements ofc urrent straying or recolonization rates provide no direct information about the magnitude or consistency of such rates in the past. In this respect, data from protein electrophoresis or DNA analyses can be very useful because they reflect levels of gene flow that have occurred over evolutionary time scales. The best strategy is to use all available lines of evidence for or against reproductive isolation, recognizing the limitations of each and taking advantage of the often complementary nature of the different types of information. If available evidence indicates significant reproductive isolation, the next step is to determine whether the population in question is of substantial ecological/genetic importance to the species as a whole. In other words, if the population became extinct, would this event represent a significant loss to the ecological/genetic diversity of thes pecies? In making this determination, the following questions are relevant: 1) Is the population genetically distinct from other conspecific populations? 2) Does the population occupy unusual or distinctive habitat? 3) Does the population show evidence of unusual or distinctive adaptation to its environment? Several types of information are useful in addressing these questions. Again, the strengths and limitations of each should be kept in mind in making the evaluation. Phenotypic/life-history traits such as size, fecundity, and age and time of spawning may reflect local adaptations of evolutionary importance, but interpretation of these traits is complicated by their sensitivity to environmental conditions. Data from protein electrophoresis or DNA analyses provide valuable insight into theprocessofgenetic differentiation among populations but little direct information regarding the extent of adaptive genetic differences. Habitat differences suggest the possibility for local adaptations but do not prove that such adaptations exist. The framework suggested here provides a focal point for accomplishing the majorgoal of the Act-to conserve the genetic diversity of species and the ecosystems they inhabit. At the same time, it allows discretion in the listing of populations by requiring that they represent units of real evolutionary significance to the species. Further, this framework provides a means of addressing several issues of particular concern for Pacific salmon, including anadromous/nonanadromous population segments, differences in run-timing, groups of populations, introduced populations, and the role of hatchery fish...|$|R
