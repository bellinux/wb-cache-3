40|$|This paper uses {{industry}} and firm data {{to look at}} price cost <b>mark-ups</b> and firm profit margins in UK manufacturing and services. In particular it examines how they behave over the business cycle. It has two main findings. First, the estimated average <b>mark-ups</b> and the profit margin results both {{suggest that there is}} imperfect competition in manufacturing and services. Second, <b>mark-ups</b> are pro-cyclical, as are profit margins even after allowing for movements in their standard determinants. This suggests that price pressures may increase during recovery periods and decrease during recessions. One possible explanation for this is Kreps and Scheinkman's argument that the pro-cyclicality of capacity constraints means that firms move between Cournot and Bertrand competition over the cycle. The finding that <b>mark-ups</b> are pro- cyclical also raises doubts about macroeconomic models that assume that demand shocks may affect employment via counter-cyclical <b>mark-ups.</b> ...|$|R

Surveys reporting unaffordable medicine prices and high <b>mark-ups</b> have spurred efforts to reduce medicine prices, but price reduction goals are arbitrary {{in the absence of}} information on pharmacy costs, revenues, and profit structures. Health services research is needed to develop sustainable and "reasonable" medicine price goals and strategic initiatives to reach them. METHODS. We utilized cost accounting methods on inventory and financial information obtained from a not-for-profit rural pharmacy network in mountainous Kyrgyzstan to quantify costs, revenues, profits and medicine <b>mark-ups</b> during establishment and maintenance periods (October 2004 -December 2007). RESULTS: Twelve pharmacies and one warehouse were established in remote Kyrgyzstan with 100 %, respectively.

The Empowering Patients First Act which was proposed as a replacing amendment to the Senate Bill during the bill <b>mark-up.</b> However, this alternative bill was rejected by the Senate Finance Committee. The Congressional Budget Office said that it would not reduce the percentage of working age people who do not have insurance over the next 10 years, and that it estimated it would encourage health insurers to reduce rather than increase insurance coverage as it would remove mandated coverage rules that currently apply in some states. This bill would have given the insurance industry greater access to government funds through new insurance subsidies. It did not have any taxation provisions and though it would reduce the deficit over 10 years by $18 billion, this was a considerably smaller deficit reduction than either the House or the Senate bills.|$|E
25|$|Each bill {{goes through}} several stages in each house {{including}} consideration {{by a committee}} and advice from the Government Accountability Office. Most legislation is considered by standing committees which have jurisdiction over a particular subject such as Agriculture or Appropriations. The House has twenty standing committees; the Senate has sixteen. Standing committees meet at least once each month. Almost all standing committee meetings for transacting business must {{be open to the}} public unless the committee votes, publicly, to close the meeting. A committee might call for public hearings on important bills. Each committee is led by a chair who belongs to the majority party and a ranking member of the minority party. Witnesses and experts can present their case for or against a bill. Then, a bill may go to what's called a <b>mark-up</b> session where committee members debate the bill's merits and may offer amendments or revisions. Committees may also amend the bill, but the full house holds the power to accept or reject committee amendments. After debate, the committee votes whether it wishes to report the measure to the full house. If a bill is tabled then it is rejected. If amendments are extensive, sometimes a new bill with amendments built in will be submitted as a so-called clean bill with a new number. Both houses have procedures under which committees can be bypassed or overruled but they are rarely used. Generally, members who have been in Congress longer have greater seniority and therefore greater power.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} price-marginal cost <b>mark-ups</b> for Canadian manufacturing {{industries in}} order {{to assess the impact of}} import competition on domestic market power. The results are mixed. Although the overall relationship between <b>mark-ups</b> and imports is positive across industries for the early 1970 s and insignificant for the late 1970 s, there is some weak cross-sectional evidence to suggest that imports reduce market power in domestically concentrated industries. Changes in imports between the two periods, however, have a positive impact on <b>mark-ups</b> in concentrated industries. Thus, there is no consistent evidence for Canada that imports have had the beneficial impact on competition that has been emphasized in much of the literature. In contrast, an interesting result of the paper is that increases in exports are associated with reductions in <b>mark-ups,</b> suggesting that exports may have a stronger pro-competitive impact on domestic firms than imports.

40|$|Income {{differences}} across countries are {{to a large}} degree driven by differences in aggregate TFP. Recently {{it has been argued that}} part of these differences are due to misallocation of factor across firms. In this paper we propose a structural model of this degree of misallocation. Our model is one where monopolistic competition across firms generates non-constant <b>mark-ups,</b> which reduce aggregate TFP relative to the competitive benchmark. Equilibrium <b>mark-ups</b> depend only on the distribution of firm-level productivity, which evolves endogenously according to a Schumpeterian process of creative destruction. This provides the link between the economy’s innovation environment and the equilibrium degree of misallocation. In particular, the economy’s entry intensity is a sufficient statistic for the invariant distribution of <b>mark-ups</b> and their TFP consequences. If entry is more intense, aggregate TFP is higher, as product market competition reduces the distorting effect of <b>mark-ups.</b> This provides a new channel how impediments to firm entry, like entry costs, reduce allocative efficiency, aggregate TFP and income per capita. ...|$|R
