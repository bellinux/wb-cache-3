A modified gate driving mechanism is proposed to enhance the <b>MOS</b> <b>resistor</b> properties. Generally, MOS resistors behave linearly only for a small value of Drain-to-Source voltage (VDS). With the new scheme, the non-linearity that arises out of its dependence on VDS is removed and the linearity property of the resistor is kept intact even for larger values of VDS...|$|E
40|$|Current {{comparator}} is {{a fundamental}} component of current-mode analog integrated circuits. A novel high-performance continuous-time CMOS current comparator is proposed in this paper, which comprises one CMOS complementary amplifier, two resistive-load amplifiers and two CMOS inverters. A <b>MOS</b> <b>resistor</b> is used as the CMOS complementary amplifier's negative feedback. Because the voltage swings of the CMOS complementary amplifier are reduced by low input and output resistances, the delay time of the current comparator is shortened. Its power consumption can be reduced rapidly {{with the increase of}} input current. Simulation results based on 1. 2 m CMOS process model show the speed of the novel current comparator is comparable with those of the existing fastest CMOS current comparators, and its power consumption is the lowest, so it has the smallest power-delay product. Furthermore, the new current comparator occupies small area and is process-robust, so it is very suitable to high-speed and low-power applications...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a massively parallel processing array {{designed for the}} 0. 13 µm 1. 5 V standard CMOS base process of a commercial 3 -D TSV stack. The array, which will constitute {{one of the fundamental}} blocks of a smart CMOS imager currently under design, implements isotropic Gaussian filtering by means of a MOS-based RC network. Alternatively, this filtering can be turned into anisotropic by a very simple voltage comparator between neighboring nodes whose output controls the gate of the elementary <b>MOS</b> <b>resistor.</b> Anisotropic diffusion enables image enhancement by removing noise and small local variations while preserving edges. A binary edge image can be also attained by combining the output of the voltage comparators. In addition to these processing capabilities, the simulations have confirmed the robustness of the array against process variations and mismatch. The power consumption extrapolated for a VGA-resolution array processing images at 30 fps is 570 µW.

40|$|Thin-film fully-depleted (FD) SOI MOSFETs {{are very}} {{promising}} {{for the implementation}} of highly-linear <b>MOS</b> <b>resistors.</b> It has been demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally that, due to their low body effect, the drain current of FD SOI MOS structures presents much lower signal distortion than bulk Si counterparts, when the transistors are biased in the strong-inversion linear regime and a sine signal is applied at the source or drain terminal, the gate voltage being used as a DC control voltage for fine tuning of resistor value. Balanced structures combining one or two MOS pairs-to attenuate odd or odd-and-even order harmonics respectively-are used to implement continuous-time (CT) filters of the MOSFET-C type which are of great interest for the integration of low-voltage analog filters. This work discusses the first SOI MOSFET-C filter implementations and investigates their potential for low-voltage and high-temperature applications.

40|$|One of the {{promising}} {{areas of research}} in microelectronics {{is the development of}} ultralow-power smart sensor LSIs that operate in the subthreshold region. To step toward these ultralow-power subthreshold CMOS-LSIs, we first need to develop a constant current reference circuit that can operate with ultralow-power dissipation. Using this reference circuit, we can construct pre- and post- signal processing circuits with ultralow-power dissipation for the smart sensors. In this work, an ultralow-power constant current reference circuit with low temperature dependence is proposed. This circuit consists of a constant-current subcircuit and a bias-voltage subcircuit, and it compensates for the temperature characteristics of mobility (µ), thermal voltage (VT = kBT/q), and threshold voltage (VTH) {{in such a way that}} the reference current has small temperature dependence. As an example in the design of setting the output reference current at 100 nA, a SPICE simulation demonstrated that total power dissipation is 1. 1 µW and the variation in the reference current can be kept very small within ± 4 % in a wide temperature range from- 20 to 100 °C. Circuit configuration The current reference circuit we propose consists of a constant-current subcircuit and a bias-voltage subcircuit. The latter supplies a bias voltage to the former. Figure 1 shows the constant-current subcircuit. It is based on the basic β–multiplier self biasing circuit and uses a <b>MOS</b> <b>resistor</b> instead of a passiv...|$|E

40|$|With a {{combination}} of engineering approaches and neurophysiological knowledge of the central nervous system, {{a new generation of}} medical devices is being developed to link groups of neurons with microelectronic systems. By doing this, researchers are acquiring fundamental knowledge of the mechanisms of disease and innovating treatments for disabilities in patients who have a failure of communication along neural pathways. A low-noise and low-power analog front-end circuit is one of the primary requirements for neural recording. The main function for the front-end amplifier is to provide gain over the bandwidth of neural signals and to reject undesired frequency components. The chip developed in this thesis is a field-programmable analog front-end amplifier consisting of 16 programmable channels with tunable frequency response. A capacitively coupled two-stage amplifier is used. The first-stage amplifier is a Low-Noise Amplifier (LNA), as it directly interfaces with the neural recording micro-electrodes; the second stage is a high gain and high swing amplifier. A <b>MOS</b> <b>resistor</b> in the feedback path is used to get tunable low-cut-off frequency and reject the dc offset voltage. Our design builds upon previous recording chips designed by two former graduate stu- dents in our lab. In our design, the circuits are optimized for low noise. Our simulations show the recording channel has a gain of 77. 9 dB and input-referred noise of 6. 95 µV rms(Root-Mean-Square voltage) over 750 Hz to 6. 9 kHz. The chip is fabricated in AMS 0. 35 µm CMOS technology for a total die area of 3 x 3 mm 2 and Total Power Dissipation (TPD) of 2. 9 mW. To verify the functionality and adherence to the design specifications it will be tested on Printed-Circuit-Board...|$|E

Improving linearity and tunability {{in the presence of}} non-ideal factors such as bulk modulation, mobility-degradation effects and mismatch of transistors is a principal objective. A family of new non-saturation-mode resistors and two novel saturation-mode transconductors are developed. Where possible, approximate analytical expressions are derived to explain the principles of operation. Performance comparisons of the new structures are made with other well-known circuits and their relative advantages and disadvantages evaluated. Experimental and simulation results are presented which validate the proposed linearisation techniques. It is shown that the proposed family of resistors offers improved linearity whilst the transconductors combine extended tunability with low distortion.
