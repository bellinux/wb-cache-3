The basic regularities {{on the set of}} objects at this ordering become evident. Besides, such structures (tables) have high inductive opportunities: many latent properties of objects may be predicted on their coordinates in this table. Opportunities of a method are illustrated on an example of bidimentional ordering of chemical elements. The table received in result practically coincides with the periodic <b>Mendeleev</b> <b>table...</b>|$|E
40|$|Many Researchers are researching in {{the field}} of Wireless Networks around the world. The results of these {{researches}} are the annual production of several new protocols and standards. Since the field is divided into several sub- categories so, each new protocol is presented must place in this sub-categories based on its own structure. Many researchers proposed new ideas {{in the field}} of protocol classifications that they seem appropriate categories in the last few years. According to the expand area of wireless network research and studies on intelligent methods right now and classifications are inefficient and need to be designed a new classification. One of the most fundamental problems in this area is the lack of a comprehensive structure classification to accommodate the new intelligent protocol. In this paper, we are going to compare different protocols and available classifications, presenting a new classification by modeling from <b>Mendeleev</b> <b>table</b> where protocols can be classified in one of the branches of the tree, and allocate a unique code in the world...|$|E
40|$|The usual {{periodic}} {{tables of}} the chemical elements are already 97 % in accord with quantum mechanics. Three elements only do not fit correctly into it, in disagreement with the Pauli exclusion principle 1. In order to ensure coherence, it is put forward to place helium beside hydrogen into the s-block. Lutetium and lawrencium pertain to the d-block of the transition metals {{and should not be}} in the f-block with the rare earths or the actinoids. By replacing the lanthanoids (rare earths or lanthanides) and actinoids (actinides) boxes of the official IUPAC periodic table by those of lutetium and lawrencium, with helium placed beside hydrogen, the compact periodic table is 100 % quantum mechanics correct. History of the periodic table The <b>Mendeleev</b> <b>table</b> is more than one century old. The number of columns was 6 in 1869, corrected to 8 in 1871, at the origin, based on atomic masses with twelve lines and eight columns, corresponding approximately to the s, p and d-blocks of quantum mechanics. The transition metals were moved separately and the corresponding column was replaced b...|$|E

40|$|A new {{approach}} to description of hadron spectroscopy is proposed. By assumption, the form of spectrum is dictated by the trace of energy momentum tensor in QCD. This provides the relativistic and renormalization invariance of hadron masses. The constructed scheme {{is applied to the}} light mesons for which two complementary interpretations are worked out. The first one represents an "atomic" structure of resonances above 1 GeV in which the quanta of non-perturbative gluon contributions are quantified via an effective formation of quasiparticles representing likely gluon analogues of positronium. This picture allows to build a "periodic table of the hadronic elements", i. e. to classify hadrons, in some sense, in analogy with <b>Mendeleev</b> <b>table</b> in chemistry. The classification does not require introduction of the orbital angular momentum associated with hadron constituents. The Regge and radial trajectories emerge in a natural way. The second interpretation is based on a "collisional" nature of some (or many) hadrons, specifically of scalar resonances below 1 GeV. Here the role of quasiparticles is played by another hadron. This picture in particular leads to a simple explanation of the puzzling scalar sector below 1 GeV with correct predictions for masses and dominant decay modes...|$|E

5000|$|In 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev {{published}} a periodic table of all known elements (he predicted several new elements {{to complete the}} table, and corrected some atomic weights).

Meyer, as well as other chemists, was doubtful about Mendeleev's periodic law, and he criticized Mendeleev for [...] "changing existing elements' atomic weights, only regarding possibility of periodical law in its structure". However, Mendeleev's work received significant support, when the new elements were found as predicted and atomic weights accordingly.|$|R

40|$|The {{parameters}} of localization patterns emerging at the linear stage of work hardening {{are discussed in}} the frame of autowave concept. The stress-strain diagrams have been plotted for the test samples of metals exposed to active loading. It is found that the product of phase autowave velocity and length has the same order of magnitude as the product of elastic wave rate and the lattice constant of the respective metal; hence, this quantity can be regarded aselastic-plastic invariant. The invariant is found to vary in a regular manner with the shear modulus, modulus of dilatation and interplanar spacing. The data obtained for elements of one and the same period of <b>Mendeleev's</b> <b>table</b> of elements are found to vary monotonically; however, after changing over to the next period, a jump-wise variation in the data would occur. It can thus be concluded that the elastic-plastic invariant is a dominant characteristic of plasticity;the nature of the invariant is related to the lattice properties and the phonon density of crystal lattice...|$|R
