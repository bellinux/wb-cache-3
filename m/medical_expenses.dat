40|$|This article {{analyzes}} the <b>medical</b> <b>expense</b> deduction based on {{several years of}} Internal Revenue Service public use file detailed individual tax return data. The <b>medical</b> <b>expense</b> deduction is allowed by the U. S. Internal Revenue Code for individual income taxpayers who itemize their deductions with certain limitations. Our analysis reveals several interesting findings. In particular, change in the limitation for adjusted gross income has had a dramatic effect on the income profile of taxpayers who claim <b>medical</b> <b>expense</b> deductions (while <b>medical</b> <b>expense</b> dollars have increased dramatically). In addition, we find the <b>medical</b> <b>expense</b> deduction has a small but a generally progressive effect across the income spectrum of U. S. taxpayers. Furthermore, elimination of the <b>medical</b> <b>expense</b> deduction would have a modestly adverse effect on income equality. <b>Medical</b> <b>expense</b> deduction Income tax Distributional impacts...|$|R

5|$|A 2002 study {{conducted}} by CARE International across three districts in the Central Region of Malawi considers how HIV/AIDS has affected economic well-being in rural Malawi. When skilled laborers are infected with HIV, they are usually unable to work; therefore, they often shift agricultural production on their land to less labor-intensive crops, sacrificing the opportunity to grow more profitable, labor-intensive crops such as tobacco. When family members fall ill with HIV/AIDS, their relatives invest time in their treatment and care, further reducing household productivity. In addition, when family members are infected with HIV, households often use the money they would normally invest in agriculture to cover <b>medical</b> <b>expenses,</b> further decreasing economic stability at the household level. Finally, when adults contract HIV, their children often remain home from school {{to work in the}} fields, threatening long-term productivity and economic advancement in Malawi.|$|E
