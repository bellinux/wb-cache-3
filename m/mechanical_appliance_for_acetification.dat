40|$|Industry {{has progressed}} {{considerably}} in substituting <b>mechanical</b> <b>appliances</b> <b>for</b> hand labor, thereby vastly reducing unit production costs. In more recent years agriculture {{has been making}} wider uses of mechanical equipment {{with the result that}} production has been increased, altho the proportion of agricultural laborers has markedly declined. Kinsman 1 states that within the last 75 years a man 2 ̆ 7 s ability as a field worker on the farm has been trebled. As the future of agriculture is studied {{it seems likely that the}} greatest opportunity for reducing production costs is to increase the output per man thru mechanical equipment. It is with a hope of lessening labor costs that mechanical milkers are now being installed on numerous dairy farms...|$|R
6000|$|The striving, go-ahead {{character}} of England and the United States {{is only a}} fit subject of disapproving criticism {{on account of the}} very secondary objects on which it commonly expends its strength. In itself it is the foundation of the best hopes for the general improvement of mankind. It has been acutely remarked that whenever any thing goes amiss, the habitual impulse of French people is to say, [...] "Il faut de la patience;" [...] and of English people, [...] "What a shame!" [...] The people who think it a shame when any thing goes wrong--who rush {{to the conclusion that the}} evil could and ought to have been prevented, are those who, in the long run, do most to make the world better. If the desires are low placed, if they extend to little beyond physical comfort, and the show of riches, the immediate results of the energy will not be much more than the continual extension of man's power over material objects; but even this makes room, and prepares the <b>mechanical</b> <b>appliances</b> <b>for</b> the greatest intellectual and social achievements; and while the energy is there, some persons will apply it, and it will be applied more and more, to the perfecting, not of outward circumstances alone, but of man's inward nature. Inactivity, unaspiringness, absence of desire, are a more fatal hindrance to improvement than any misdirection of energy, and is that through which alone, when existing in the mass, any very formidable misdirection by an energetic few becomes possible. It is this, mainly, which retains in a savage or semi-savage state the great majority of the human race.|$|R
40|$|The {{industrial}} {{and population growth}} in Java leads to converse the land function from the agriculture to industrial, estate and high way. Therefore, the development of agriculture must be relocated to outside Java, where {{there are a lot}} of land available. One agricultural of problems in outsideJava is the lack of labour especially for land cultivation and other which need many labour. The use of <b>mechanical</b> <b>appliance.</b> is the best alternative to overcome that problem.

40|$|In {{the recent}} years, laser {{machining}} {{technology has been}} used widely in industrial applications usually {{with the aim of}} increasing the production capability of mass production lines - especially for fast marking, engraving type of applications where speed is an important concern - or manufacturing quality of a certain facility by increasing the level of accuracy in material processing applications such as drilling, cutting; or any scientific research oriented work where high precision machining of parts in sub millimeter scale might be required. A galvanometric scanner is a high precision device that is able to steer a laser beam with a mirror attached to a motor, whose rotor angular range is usually limited with tens of degrees in both directions of rotation; and position is controlled either by voltage or current. Due to their lightness, the rotor and the mirror can move very fast, allowing fast marking (burning out) operation with the laser beam. This can be evaluated as a great advantage compared to slower <b>mechanical</b> <b>appliances</b> used <b>for</b> cutting/machining of different materials. This study concentrates on the analysis of galvanometric scanner system components; and the design and implementation of a hardware and software based control system for a dual-axis galvo setup; and their adaptation for use in laser micromachining applications either as a standalone system or a modular subsystem. Analysis part of the thesis work contains: evaluation of dominant laser micromachining techniques, an overview of the galvanometric scanner system based approach and related components (e. g. electromechanical, electrical, optical), understanding of working principles and related simulation work, compatibility issues with the target micromachining applications. Design part of the thesis work includes: the design and implementation of electronic controller board, intermediate drive electronics stage, microcontroller programming for machining control algorithm, interfacing with graphical user interface based control software and production of necessary mechanical parts. The study has been finalized with experimental work and evaluation of obtained results. The results of these studies are promising and motivate the use of laser galvanometric scanner systems in laser micromachining applications...|$|R
