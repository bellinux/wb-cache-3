40|$|Retention of {{misfolded}} {{proteins in}} the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) {{is a primary}} mechanism of quality control. To discover whether quality control can <b>monitor</b> <b>assembly</b> inside the hydrophobic ER membrane, we characterized the folding and transport of the tetraspanin glycoprotein CD 82. Truncated forms of CD 82 that are missing one or more transmembrane segments remain in the ER. A construct (TM  2 – 4) that is missing the first transmembrane segment remains in the ER, even though its extracellular domain, which is facing the ER lumen, has folded to the native structure. Transport to the cell surface is restored by co-expressing the missing segment (TM  1) as a separate polypeptide. Prior to leaving the ER, CD 82 transiently associates with the membrane-bound chaperone calnexin but not with its soluble homolog calreticulin. TM  2 – 4, in contrast, remains in a prolonged interaction with calnexin that is partially reversed by co-expressing TM  1. These findings establish a simple system to study transmembrane domain assembly, show that ER quality control can directly <b>monitor</b> <b>assembly</b> inside the lipid bilayer and suggest that calnexin {{may play a role}} in this process...|$|E

LEDGF/p 75, a key cellular binding partner of the lentiviral enzyme, also stabilizes a tetrameric form of IN. However, functional assays have indicated {{the importance of the}} order of viral DNA and LEDGF/ p 75 addition to IN for productive concerted integration. Here, we employed Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) to <b>monitor</b> <b>assembly</b> of indi-vidual IN subunits into tetramers in the presence of viral DNA and LEDGF/p 75. The IN–viral DNA and IN–LEDGF/p 75 complexes yielded significantly different FRET values suggesting two distinct IN conformations in these complexes. Furthermore, the order of addition experiments indicated that FRET for the preformed IN–viral DNA complex remained unchanged upon its subsequent binding to LEDGF/p 75, whereas pre-incubation of LEDGF/ p 75 and IN followed by addition of viral DNA yielded FRET very similar to the IN–LEDGF/p 75 complex. These findings provide new insights into the structural organization of IN subunits in func-tional concerted integration intermediates and suggest that differential multimerization of IN in the presence of various ligands could be exploited as a plausible therapeutic target for development of allosteric inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|Yeast mutants {{that are}} conditionally blocked at {{distinctive}} steps in secretion and export of cell surface proteins {{have been used}} to <b>monitor</b> <b>assembly</b> of integral plasma membrane proteins. Mutants blocked in transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (sec 18), from the Golgi body (sec 7 and sec 14), and in transport of secretory vesicles (sec 1) show dramatically reduced assembly of galactose and arginine permease activities. Simultaneous induction of galactose permease and alpha-galactosidase (a secreted glycoprotein) in sec mutant cells at the nonpermissive temperature (37 degrees C) shows that both activities accumulate and can be exported coordinately when cells are returned to the permissive temperature (24 degrees C) in {{the presence or absence of}} cycloheximide. Plasma membrane fractions isolated from sec mutant cells radiolabeled at 37 degrees C have been analyzed by two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. Although most of the major protein species seen in plasma membranes from wild-type cells are not efficiently localized in sec 18 or sec 7, several of these proteins appear in plasma membranes from sec 1 cells. These results may be explained by contamination of plasma membrane fractions with precursor vesicles that accumulate in sec 1 cells. Alternatively, some proteins may branch off during transport along the secretory pathway and be inserted into the plasma membrane by a different mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Virus capsid {{assembly}} {{has been}} widely studied as a biophysical system, both for its biological and medical significance and as an important model for complex self-assembly processes. No current technology can <b>monitor</b> <b>assembly</b> in detail and what information we have on assembly kinetics comes exclusively from in vitro studies. There are many differences between the intracellular environment and that of an in vitro assembly assay, however, that {{might be expected to}} alter assembly pathways. Here, we explore one specific feature characteristic of the intracellular environment and known to have large effects on macromolecular assembly processes: molecular crowding. We combine prior particle simulation methods for estimating crowding effects with coarse-grained stochastic models of capsid assembly, using the crowding models to adjust kinetics of capsid simulations to examine possible effects of crowding on assembly pathways. Simulations suggest a striking difference depending on whether or not a system uses nucleation-limited assembly, with crowding tending to promote off-pathway growth in a nonnucleation-limited model but often enhancing assembly efficiency at high crowding levels even while impeding it at lower crowding levels in a nucleation-limited model. These models may help us understand how complicated assembly systems may have evolved to function with high efficiency and fidelity in the densely crowded environment of the cell...|$|E

The technique thus is particularly useful for <b>monitoring</b> <b>assembly</b> (polymerization and aggregation) reactions {{without the need for}} removing aliquots from the assembly system or disrupting the assembly process in any other way.

The ability to monitor the temporal evolution of particle size provides a powerful tool for studying protein assembly.

Cys and Ser mutants of NarG-His 49 both lack catalytic activity, {{with only the}} former assembling FS 0 and Mo-bisPGD. Importantly, both prosthetic groups are absent in the NarG-H 49 S mutant. EPR spectroscopy of the Cys mutant reveals that the Em value of the FS 0 cluster is decreased by at least 500 mV, preventing its participation in electron transfer to the Mo-bisPGD cofactor. To demonstrate that decreasing the FS 0 cluster Em results in decreased enzyme activity, we mutated a critical Arg residue (NarG-Arg 94) {{in the vicinity of}} FS 0 to a Ser residue. In this case, the Em of FS 0 is decreased by 115 mV, with a concomitant decrease in enzyme turnover to ∼ 30 % of the wild type. Analysis {{of the structure of the}} NarG-H 49 S mutant reveals two important aspects of NarGHI maturation: (i) apomolybdo-NarGHI is able to bind GDP moieties at their respective P and Q sites in the absence of the Mo-bisPGD cofactor, and (ii) a critical segment of residues in NarG, 49 HGVNCTG 55, must be correctly positioned to ensure holoenzyme maturation...|$|E
40|$|The {{assembly}} of amyloidogenic proteins into toxic oligomers is a seminal {{event in the}} pathogenesis of protein misfolding diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases, hereditary amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and type 2 diabetes. Owing to the metastable nature of these protein assemblies, {{it is difficult to}} assess their oligomer size distribution quantitatively using classical methods, such as electrophoresis, chromatography, fluorescence, or dynamic light scattering. Oligomers of amyloidogenic proteins exist as metastable mixtures, in which the oligomers dissociate into monomers and associate into larger assemblies simultaneously. PICUP stabilizes oligomer populations by covalent cross-linking and when combined with fractionation methods, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) or size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), PICUP provides snapshots of the oligomer size distributions that existed before cross-linking. Hence, PICUP enables visualization and quantitative analysis of metastable protein populations and can be used to <b>monitor</b> <b>assembly</b> and decipher relationships between sequence modifications and oligomerization 1. Mechanistically, PICUP involves photo-oxidation of Ru 2 + in a tris(bipyridyl) Ru(II) complex (RuBpy) to Ru 3 + by irradiation with visible light in the presence of an electron acceptor. Ru 3 + is a strong one-electron oxidizer capable of abstracting an electron from a neighboring protein molecule, generating a protein radical 1, 2. Radicals are unstable, highly-reactive species and therefore disappear rapidly through a variety of intra- and intermolecular reactions.

Hsp 40 mediates complex formation between Hsp 70 and client proteins prior to interaction with Hsp 90. We used mass spectrometry (MS) to <b>monitor</b> <b>assemblies</b> formed between eukaryotic Hsp 90 /Hsp 70 /Hsp 40, Hop, p 23, and a client protein, a fragment of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). We found that Hsp 40 promotes interactions between the client and Hsp 70, and facilitates dimerization of monomeric Hsp 70. This dimerization is antiparallel, stabilized by post-translational modifications (PTMs), and maintained in the stable heterohexameric client-loading complex Hsp 902 Hsp 702 HopGR identified here. Addition of p 23 to this client-loading complex induces transfer of GR onto Hsp 90 and leads to expulsion of Hop and Hsp 70.

The research begins with manufacturing constraint analysis to identifr which one has the most impact and govems the productivity of the line. The output of the analysis is then used for comparing the efficiency between single-model assembly line balancing and multi-model assembly line balancing approaches. In addition, the algorithms to balance the line, i. e. COMSOAL and the current factory method, are compared. The research enquiry is investigated by computer simulation. An experimental design with 3 factors, namely line balancing methods, line balancing algorithms, and conveyor speeds, are conducted to evaluate the significance ofthe factors measured {{by the number of}} stations, line efficiency, output, and throughput time. It is found that the number of stations used in the multi-model assembly line balancing is less than the single-model one. In addition, the line balancing methods and line balancing algorithms provide significant enhancements to line efficiency, output, and throughput time. The multi-model assembly line balancing combined with COMSOAL method contributes to higher line efficiency, higher output, and less throughput time. Moreover, the conveyor speeds only influence the throughput time, without any impact on line efficiency and output. Key words: Multi-model line-balancing, Computer simulation. 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} observe edge neutral {{recycling}} for fusion machine operation, the absolute values of Hα and HeI emissions have been usually analyzed with measurement of edge density and temperature. On the other hand, {{it is known}} that the temperature and density dependences of each line can be negated by taking the ratio between the two lines. The intensity ratio of Hα (6563 ?) to HeI (5876 ? or 6678 ?) visible spectral lines is adopted, and the results are presented here instead of the method usually used for monitoring the edge particle recycling and the effect of wall conditioning in LHD. The ionization events per photon were calculated for both emissions using a collisional-radiative model, and the ratio of H+ flux (≡ H 0 influx) to He+ flux (≡ He 0 influx) was obtained. The Hα and HeI (5876 ?) emissions in LHD have been measured using a <b>monitor</b> <b>assembly</b> with an interference filter and optical fiber array. The H+ /He+ flux ratio has been thus evaluated by integrating the Hα and HeI emissions from a 10 -channel toroidal array.

The present method shows that the aftereffects of the H 2 and He glow discharge cleaning for vacuum wall conditioning on the LHD discharges become clearly visible.

Some mutant forms of Hsp 90 also displayed reduced Sti 1 interaction in the presence of a nucleotide. These studies indicate that cycling of Hsp 90 between the nucleotide-free, open conformation and the ATP-bound, closed conformation is influenced by residues both within and outside the N-terminal ATPase domain and that these conformational changes have dramatic effects on interaction with cochaperone proteins...|$|R
