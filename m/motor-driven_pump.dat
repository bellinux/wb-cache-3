50|$|A {{refinement}} of the piston machine is the pump-driven machine, which {{was introduced in}} the Faema E61 in 1961, and has become the most popular design in commercial espresso bars. Instead of using manual force, a <b>motor-driven</b> <b>pump</b> provides the force necessary for espresso brewing. Espresso machines are made to accept water directly from a cold water line supply, common in commercial installations, or from a separate tank that must be filled with water by hand. The latter is more common with lower-volume commercial installations and domestic espresso machines. Due to the required high pumping pressure and precision flow control needed, the particular type of electric pumps typically used are known as solenoid-piston pumps. These pumps are classified as a positive displacement type (general category) of pump.|$|E

40|$|LectureDelayed coking is a {{refining}} process {{that consists of}} the upgrading of petroleum residues into lighter and more valuable hydrocarbon fractions by promoting thermal cracking on the residue stream. Petroleum coke is a by-product of this process and depending on its morphology {{it can be used}} as fuel for steam generation, cement calcination or as feed stock for the manufacturing of aluminum and steel. Delayed cokers are very complex systems and require a considerable amount of hardware such as fired heaters, coke drums, a main fractionator and a hydraulic decoking system. In a typical delayed coker petroleum residues are passed through fired heaters before they are charged, in an alternating fashion, into large drums as boiling product. In the drums some of this effluent thermally cracks into lighter fractions (vapors) and these are removed from the drum overhead and returned to the coker fractionator before they are sent to a gas plant for further refining. The heavier product that stays behind slowly forms into coke and it is allowed to fill the drum over time. This time is takes to do this is usually referred to as the coking cycle. Once the drum is full and the feed is switched to start filling an empty drum, a series of activities such as sludging, quenching and steam-outs are performed on the full drum prior to removing the ocke. Very high pressure water is used to cut this solid coke out and after some preparations this drum is empty and ready for a new coking cycle to begin again. As stated above, delayed coking is thus a combination of a continuous process through the fractionation tower and furnace and a batch process in the drums. As a result of this configuration the high pressure decoking pump only needs to operate a portion of the total cycle time. Regardless of its ?part-time? operation the water jet coke cutting pump is still a very important component of the hydraulic decoking system because it not only provides the required cutting pressure necessary to cut the coke but also contributes to the quality of coke removed and the duration fo the decoking cycle. Recent history shows that the majority of new hydraulic decoking installations use electric motor drived with fixed speed operation. The pump generally requires on operating speed to produce the necessary pressure to cut the coke and its flow, pressurization, and depressurization duties are controlled by a decoking control valve. During noncutting cycles operators typically shut off the motor to minimize power consumption of the system or they keep the motor running (rarely done), depressurize the line and operate this valve on bypass to recirculate the water through a holding tank until the coke cutting is resumed. Both operating alternatives have their disadvantages with regard reliability (the first) and energy consumption (the second). This paper explores the use of a hydrodynamic variable speed drive (HVSD) with an electric <b>motor-driven</b> <b>pump</b> as a way to increase the flexibility and reliability of the hydraulic decoking system. The HVSD or variable speed coupling (VSC) is able to seamlessly vary the speed of the pump and accomplish the following: Keep the motor running and operate the pump at minimum idle speed during noncutting cycles, avoiding periodic motor shutdowns and start ups; Eliminate the need for soft starter or special motor design considerations to handle periodic start ups; Reduce work and extend life of the decoking control valve by helping with depressurization duties during noncutting cycles and cutting tool mode shifting; Efficiently adjust cutting pressures depending on feed stock quality to avoid coke pulverization. This paper also describes the function of the variable speed coupling and how its unique design features are suited for the start up and intermittent operation of the water jet coke cutting pump. Field data and operator experience from two existing installations are collected and evaluated and the advantages of variable speed operation over fixed speed operation of the decoking pump are highlighted...|$|E

40|$|Motor {{current and}} power {{analysis}} {{methods have been}} developed to assist in the condition monitoring of a variety of motor-driven devices. The successful implementation of motor current signature analysis (MCSA) as a diagnostic for valves led to its application to other devices and to refinements in the methodologies used. A variety of pump applications, ranging from 5 to over 1200 horsepower have been analyzed, including low and high specific speed and suction specific speed pumps. For some of the pumps, the full range of flow conditions from shutoff to runout has been studied. Motor current and power analysis have been found to provide information that is complementary to that available from conventional diagnostics, such as vibration and pressure pulsation analysis. Inherent signal filtering associated with rotor to stator magnetic field coupling does limit the high frequency response capability of the motor as a transducer; as a result certain phenomena, such as vane pass energy, is not readily apparent in the motor electrical signals. On the other hand, the motor-monitored parameters have often been found to be much more sensitive than vibration transducers in detecting the effects of unsteady flow conditions resulting from both system and pump specific sources such as suction cavitation. By combining motor equivalent circuit models with pump performance characteristics, shaft power and torque fluctuation estimates have been assessed. The usefulness of motor data in assessing some common sources of pump problems, such as mechanical and hydraulic imbalance, misalignment, and unstable flow conditions is shown. The results of testing several <b>motor-driven</b> <b>pumps,</b> including comparisons with vibration and pressure pulsation analysis are discussed.

Considerable {{progress has been made}} with each successive generation of space suit design; from the Apollo A 7 L suit, to the current Shuttle Extravehicular Mobile Unit (EMU) suit, and the next generation Constellation Space Suit Element (CSSE). However, one area of space suit design which has continued to lag is the fluid pump used to drive the water cooling loop of the Primary Life Support System (PLSS). The two main types of fluid pumps typically used in space applications are rotodynamic pumps (pumping is achieved through a rotary vaned impeller) and displacement pumps (which includes rotary and diaphragm pumps). The rotating and moving parts found in the pumps and electric motor add significantly to the susceptibility to wear and friction, thermal mismatch, and complexity of the <b>pumps.</b> Electric <b>motor-driven</b> <b>pumps</b> capable of achieving high operational reliability are necessarily large, heavy, and energy inefficient. This report describes a development effort conducted for NASA by Lynntech, Inc., who recently demonstrated the feasibility of an electrochemically-driven fluid cooling pump. With no electric motor and minimal lightweight components, an electrochemically-driven pump is expected to be significantly smaller, lighter and achieve a longer life time than conventional rotodynamic and displacement pumps. By employing sulfonated polystyrene-based proton exchange membranes, rather than conventional Nafion membranes, a significant reduction in the actuator power consumption was demonstrated. It was also demonstrated that these membranes possess the necessary mechanical strength, durability, and temperature range for long life space operation. The preliminary design for a Phase II prototype pump compares very favorably to the fluid cooling pumps currently used in space suit portable life support systems (PLSS). Characteristics of the electrochemically-driven pump are described and the benefits of the technology as a replacement for electric motor pumps in mechanically pumped single-phase fluid loops (MPFLs) is discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a real industrial example {{in which the}} steam utility network of a refinery is modelled in order to evaluate potential heat integration retrofits proposed for the site. Total site heat integration techniques have previously been used for the refinery to identify a number of possibilities for heat saving retrofits. However, the profitability and actual primary energy saving {{will depend on the}} configuration and operation of the utility system. The supply of utilities such as fuel, steam and electric power re{{presents a}} significant operating cost for many process industries. A reduced use of utilities can improve process economics and reduce the environmental footprint of the process. Heat integration, within and between the refinery process units, is one way to improve the energy efficiency and reduce the use of steam and fuels. Such heat integration measures will affect steam consumption and generation at different steam pressure levels within the network. A refinery, typically, has flexibility in their operation of the steam network from a number of switchable steam turbine-driven or <b>motor-driven</b> <b>pumps</b> and compressors. Furthermore, due to seasonal variations the amount of internally generated refinery fuel gas will vary, leading to periods of steam over-production as well as periods with a demand for additional purchased fuel. Consequently, the optimum operating strategy concerning steam production and the switchable mechanical drives is a trade-off between the cost of fuel and electricity. * Corresponding author 0258 - 1 2 This paper presents a few examples of heat integration retrofit measures from a case study of a large oil refinery.
