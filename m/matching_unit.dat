25|$|The Buddy-Watcher is a wrist mounted buddy alert device which sends an {{ultrasonic}} signal when a key is pressed, for {{at least}} 20m through the water to the <b>matching</b> <b>unit</b> on the dive buddy, which will produce a silent vibratory and visual signal alerting the diver that their buddy wants attention. There is no direct indication to the sender whether the signal has been received and no indication of distance or direction to the buddy. The device is waterproof to 40m, therefore is suited for recreational scuba diving use, but not technical diving.|$|E
50|$|At most {{facilities}} {{the mast}} radiator is {{on a separate}} base close to the antenna <b>matching</b> <b>unit,</b> {{but it can be}} sometimes be placed {{on the roof of the}} antenna <b>matching</b> <b>unit,</b> for example at the main transmission mast of the Mühlacker radio transmitter and the main transmission mast of the Ismaning radio transmitter.|$|E
50|$|If <b>matched</b> <b>units</b> are homogeneous, {{then they}} have the same causal effect. This means that {{they have the same}} average causal effect. Therefore, if all <b>units</b> are {{perfectly}} <b>matched,</b> the average causal effect equals the causal effect.|$|R
50|$|Another {{approach}} to estimation of causal effect is matching or pairing similar units, as an approximation to observing the same unit twice. If an experiment is possible, <b>match</b> <b>units</b> with identical or most similar attributes; randomly assign treatment {{to one and}} control to the other unit in each pair.|$|R
40|$|Self-organizing maps {{have been}} used {{extensively}} for condition-based maintenance, where quantization errors of test data referring to the self-organizing maps of healthy training data {{have been used}} as features. Researchers have used minimum quantization error as a health indicator, which is sensitive to noise in the training data. Some other researchers have used the average of the quantization errors as a health indicator, where the best <b>matching</b> <b>units</b> of the trained self-organizing maps are required to be convex. These requirements are not always satisfied. This paper introduces a method that improves self-organizing maps for anomaly detection by addressing these issues. Noise dominated best <b>matching</b> <b>units</b> extracted from the map trained by the healthy training data are removed, and the rest are used as healthy references. For a given test data observation, the k-nearest neighbor algorithm is applied to identify neighbors of the observation that occur in the references. Then the Euclidean distance between the test data observation and the centroid of the neighbors is calculated as a health indicator. Compared with the minimum quantization error, the health indicator extracted by this method is less sensitive to noise, and compared with the average of quantization errors, it does not put limitations on the convexity or distribution of the best <b>matching</b> <b>units.</b> The result was validated using data from experiments on cooling fan bearings. 1...|$|R

40|$|We empirically {{demonstrate}} {{that in order}} to take advantage of increasing issue widths, superscalar processors require quadratically growing instruction window sizes. Since conventional central window design aims to provide full data fan-out to all the instructions which are in the window, designing large instruction windows using conventional techniques is not feasible. We show that full data fan-out is not necessary for achieving high performance when a novel approach is used to distribute the values. We use direct matching using a small on chip memory called the wait memory to implement the instruction window and bring in a small subset of instructions which are likely to become ready into a <b>match</b> <b>unit</b> where instruction selection and operand matching tasks are performed. We show that the <b>match</b> <b>unit</b> needs to grow only linearly with the issue width.

40|$|To {{assess the}} impact of the North Carolina Career Development Plan (CDP) on student achievement, results of the California Achievement Tests, {{administered}} annually in North Carolina public schools, were analyzed.

50|$|At some facilities, {{especially}} the older and higher-powered installations, the mast radiator may be located at {{some distance from}} the transmitter building, {{in order to reduce the}} field strength induced by the mast into the building, and to prevent the building from distorting the mast's radiation pattern.

40|$|Abstract—A mesh {{generator}} for {{the production}} of high-quality finite-element meshes is being proposed. The mesh generator uses an artificial neural network, which grows during the training process in order to adapt itself to a prespecified probability distri-bution.

40|$|Conventional pretransfusion testing {{based on}} {{hemagglutination}} assays {{can be challenging}} for patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) {{because of the presence}} of auto-antibodies. It has been suggested that deoxyribonucleic acid-based methods could be more efficient in the selection of antigen-matched red blood cell units in those settings. Because of the high risk of alloimmunization of these patients and the labor-intensive nature of adsorption techniques, we decided to evaluate the feasibility of selecting antigen-matched units on the basis of RBC genotyping. We included in our routine RBC genotyping program samples from 7 patients with AIHA presenting a strongly positive direct antiglobulin test. This made the routine compatibility tests difficult. Most patients had previously received transfusions because of warm AIHA. <b>Matched</b> donor <b>units</b> were selected according to the genotype. For all but 1 patient, blood group genotyping could be done on time to allow antigen-matched transfusion. Four patients received antigen-matched red blood cell units based on RBC genotyping and for 1 patient the fact that no <b>matched</b> <b>units</b> were available led us to postpone the transfusion. After each transfusion, the recovery was recorded and considered satisfactory for all transfused patients. Journal ArticleSCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
