25|$|Low-impedance {{microphones}} are preferred {{over high}} impedance for two reasons: {{one is that}} using a high-impedance microphone with a long cable results in high frequency signal loss due to cable capacitance, which forms a low-pass filter with the <b>microphone</b> <b>output</b> impedance. The other is that long high-impedance cables tend to pick up more hum (and possibly radio-frequency interference (RFI) as well). Nothing is damaged if the impedance between microphone and other equipment is mismatched; the worst that happens is a reduction in signal or change in frequency response.|$|E
500|$|Jackson mixed Streisand's , using a Digidesign Venue digital {{mixing console}} at FOH for its smaller {{footprint}} (allowing more audience seats) and its plug-in audio effects. As well, the Venue mixing system {{was chosen for}} its integration with Pro Tools hardware and software, to make 128-channel hard disk recordings of the concerts directly from the three Digidesign consoles: one to mix strings, one to mix brass, reeds and percussion, and one under Jackson's control out in the audience, with Streisand's microphone inputs and stems (submixes of other microphones) from the other consoles. The recordings made in New York City and Washington, D.C. were remixed into the album Live In Concert 2006—Jackson was listed as sound designer. Sharing sound designer and FOH mixing duties with Chris Carlton, Jackson made certain that the custom soft dome monitor wedges were positioned correctly aiming up from under the stage to cover everywhere Streisand might walk. Clair Brothers supplied 18 Dolby Lake Processors for the tour, the majority used by Jackson to tune the main sound system, and the rest for control of monitor wedges used by Streisand and by the supporting artist, Il Divo. For Streisand's voice, Jackson auditioned several wireless microphones and ended up using a Sennheiser SKM 5200 transmitter equipped with a Neumann KK 105 S supercardioid capsule. He used the vocal microphone to test the sound system from different locations around the arena. When the tour hit the UK and continental Europe, Jackson changed from a Neumann to a Røde Microphones capsule, custom made to his requirements; one that Røde called the [...] "Jackson Special". Jackson used Millennia microphone preamps for any microphone that was required {{to be sent to}} multiple mixing consoles, such as at Madison Square Garden where cable runs to the recording trucks were [...] long. The use of only one preamp prevents the <b>microphone</b> <b>output</b> from being loaded down by too little resistance which can change its tone quality.|$|E

50|$|Another ambient {{technique}} is the IRT (Institut für Rundfunktechnik) cross. Here, four cardioid microphones, 90 degrees relative to one another, {{are placed in}} square formation, separated by 21-25 cm.

5000|$|WMCA, {{which went}} all-talk in 1970, used a similar system. It {{involved}} two Ampex 350 reel-to-reel machines side by side, each with {{the order of}} its heads—normally (from left to right) erase-record-play—reversed, to be mounted play-erase-record. Thus the tape loop, transported counter-clockwise, would record the <b>microphone</b> <b>output,</b> and then have {{to go all the}} way around to play it back over the air before being erased. When the engineer, producer, or air talent hit the 'dump' button the feed would immediately be switched to the other Ampex, so there was very little disruption of the air product. Today, of course, such delays are done digitally. (ref. ex-WMCA engineer B. Golden) ...|$|E
50|$|At {{the same}} time the DC voltage across the line causes a DC current which is split between the resistor-coil (A8-A3) branch and the microphone-coil (A2-A3) branch. The DC current through the resistor-coil branch has no effect on the {{incoming}} audio signal. But the DC current passing through the microphone is turned into AC current (in response to voice sounds) which then passes through only the upper branch of the coil's (A3) primary winding, which has far fewer turns than the lower primary winding. This causes {{a small portion of the}} <b>microphone</b> <b>output</b> to be fed back to the speaker, while the rest of the AC current goes out through the phone line.|$|E
5000|$|Telephone hybrids {{are used}} in {{telephone}} exchanges to convert the 4-wire appearance to the 2-wire last mile connection to the subscriber's telephone. A different kind of hybrid is used in telephone handsets to convert the four wires of the transmitter (earpiece) and receiver (microphhone) to the 2-wire line connection. This kind of hybrid is more commonly called an induction coil due to its derivation from high-voltage induction coils. It does not produce a high voltage, but like the high-voltage variety, it is a step-up transformer in order to impedance match the low-impedance carbon button transmitter to the higher impedance parts of the system. The simple induction coil later evolved into a form of hybrid as a sidetone reduction measure, or volume of <b>microphone</b> <b>output</b> that was fed back to the earpiece. Without this, the phone user's own voice would be louder in the earpiece than the other party's. [...] Today, the transformer version of the hybrid {{has been replaced by}} resistor networks and compact IC versions, which use integrated circuit electronics to do the job of the hybrid coil.|$|E

50|$|This {{experiment}} contained two sealed pressure zones, extending {{along the}} interior {{walls of the}} satellite, which were designed to record the impact of micrometeorites large enough to pierce the satellite shell. These pressure zones were partial vacuums, each at a different pressure, and were protected by 0.66 mm magnesium walls that presented an exposed surface area of 0.162 m², which was 20% of {{the area of the}} shell. A puncture in the walls of either zone was detected by a differential pressure gauge mounted between them, and telemetered as a change in the length of one of the telemetry channels. Erosion of the satellite shell through bombardment by space dust, micrometeorites, and other particles was recorded by three chromium-strip erosion gauges mounted on the satellite surface, and by a photosensitive detector. Electrical resistances of the gauges changed as their surfaces were changed by erosion. The photosensitive detector, a cadmium sulfide cell protected by an opaque covering of aluminized PET film, also showed a resistance change as the covering was eroded or penetrated. Erosion measurements also were telemetered as channel lengths, which permitted estimates of the erosion rates. Four barium titanate-type microphones recorded micrometeorite impacts on the satellite's surface. The <b>microphone</b> <b>output</b> was amplified, shaped, and fed into a magnetic counter unit, which provided continuously, in three-decimal digits, the cumulative count of impacts. The unit counted up to 1000 and then reset to zero. The satellite recorded 6600 micrometeorite impacts during 66 days of operation, of which 2800 occurred during a 70-h interval from November 16 to 18, 1959. No penetrations or fractures were recorded in the sensors of the surface penetration experiment. Because the erosion sensors were not disrupted, no definite results could be drawn from that experiment.|$|E

30|$|It is {{well known}} that {{reverberation}} is produced by multi-path propagation of an acoustic signal from its source to the microphone in enclosed spaces. The distortion of reverberation to an acoustic signal can be modeled by the acoustic impulse response (AIR), which may last for hundreds of milliseconds. Reverberation cancelation has been tried by many researchers using deconvolution techniques that estimate and apply the inverse of the AIR to the reverberant <b>microphone</b> <b>outputs.</b> Several significant contributions have been made in these areas [1 – 7]. However, the available techniques are sensitive to estimation error of the AIR, which is difficult to estimate in realistic environments. In addition, as the talker may change location in a room, the geometry between the talker and the microphone receiver will change accordingly, and consequently, the acoustic impulse response is time-varying. The additive background noise further increases the difficulty for accurately estimating the AIR.|$|R
