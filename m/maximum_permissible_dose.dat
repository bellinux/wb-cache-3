5|$|Plutonium, when {{entering}} the body through air, food or blood (e.g. a wound), mostly settles in the lungs, liver and bones with only about 10% going to other organs, and remains there for decades. The long residence time of plutonium {{in the body}} is partly explained by its poor solubility in water. Some isotopes of plutonium emit ionizing α-radiation, which damages the surrounding cells. The median lethal dose (LD50) for 30 days in dogs after intravenous injection of plutonium is 0.32 milligram per kg of body mass, and thus the lethal dose for humans is approximately 22mg for a person weighing 70kg; the amount for respiratory exposure should be approximately four times greater. Another estimate assumes that plutonium is 50 times less toxic than radium, and thus permissible content of plutonium in the body should be 5µg or 0.3 µCi. Such amount is nearly invisible in under microscope. After trials on animals, this <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> <b>dose</b> was reduced to 0.65µg or 0.04 µCi. Studies on animals also revealed that the most dangerous plutonium exposure route is through inhalation, after which 5–25% of inhaled substances is retained in the body. Depending on the particle size and solubility of the plutonium compounds, plutonium is localized either in the lungs or in the lymphatic system, or is absorbed in the blood and then transported to the liver and bones. Contamination via food is the least likely way. In this case, only about 0.05% of soluble 0.01% insoluble compounds of plutonium absorbs into blood, {{and the rest is}} excreted. Exposure of damaged skin to plutonium would retain nearly 100% of it.|$|E

The hypothesis upon which this proposal is based is that the human population is not homogeneous in radiosensitiviry, but that radiosensitive sub-groups exist which are not easy to identify. These individuals would suffer an increased incidence of detrimental radiation effects, and distort the shape of the dose response relationship. The radiosensitivity of these groups depend on the expression levels of specific proteins. The plan was to investigate the effect of 3 relatively rare, high penetrate genes available in mice, namely Atm, mRad 9 & Brca 1. The purpose of radiation protection is to prevent! deterministic effects of clinical significance and limit stochastic effects to acceptable levels. We plan, therefore to compare with wild type animals the radiosensitivity of mice heterozygous for each of the genes mentioned above, as well as double heterozygotes for pairs of genes, using two biological endpoints: a) Ocular cataracts as an important and relevant deterministic effect, and b) Oncogenic transformation in cultured embryo fibroblasts, as a surrogate for carcinogenesis, the most relevant stochastic effect...|$|R
40|$|Liquid {{effluent}} containing {{low levels}} of radioactivity is discharged from the A. A. E. C. Research Establishment at Lucas Heights into a tidal estuary at themouth of which {{are a number of}} commercial oyster leases. Since early 1961 the levels of release have been limited by a formula taking specific account of Ra— 226, 'other α emitters', Sr- 90 and 'other β emitters'. This formula has worked well as is evidenced by the barely detectable levels of radioactivity coming from the Research Establishment found in environmental samples, but it had certain deficiencies and limitations which for operational reasons it became desirable to eliminate. A new formula is described that is sufficiently general not to require future modification in principle and which incorporates recent data on estuarine dilution and concentration factors for nuclides in oysters, and which is based on current 1 CRP recommendations and N. S. W. State Regulations concerning <b>maximum</b> <b>permissible</b> <b>doses</b> applicable to members of the general public. Discharges are limited so that population exposures resulting from the ingestion of contaminated oysters, from sunbathing on sands near the discharge point, and from the incorporation of contaminated sand in cuts are kept within acceptable limits; it also ensures that people who daily handle large quantitiesof oysters will not be subjected to unacceptable levels of irradiation.
