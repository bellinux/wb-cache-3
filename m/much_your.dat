500|$|The {{gameplay}} received mixed responses. Both John Scalzo and the Game Revolution reviewer {{compared the}} gameplay to Donkey Kong Country, with Scalzo describing {{the game as}} having a [...] "familiar, yet unique" [...] quality that he attributed to Naughty Dog's design, while the Game Revolution reviewer concluded that the game [...] "fails to achieve anything really new or revolutionary" [...] as a platform game, and the Next Generation reviewer {{went so far as}} to call it [...] "the single most derivative game to ever hit a console", adding that [...] "anyone who's played even one side-scrolling action game could have come up with every single game element found in Crash." [...] Electronic Gaming Monthlys four reviewers, while having a more positive overall impression of the game, admitted that the gameplay is short on originality, with Shawn Smith summarizing, [...] "It's like the original Mario with some 3-D effects thrown in." [...] They also noted that the gameplay is not genuinely 3-D, though they praised the mixture of side scrolling, front scrolling, and back scrolling sections. Tommy Glide remarked that the gameplay [...] "lacks some of the diversity and innovative next-gen qualities found in Sega's Nights and Nintendo's Mario 64." [...] The IGN reviewer said that the game [...] "isn't a revolution in platform game design. It's pretty <b>much</b> <b>your</b> standard platform game". However, he noted the game's [...] "surprisingly deep" [...] depth of field and use of different perspectives as exceptions to the platforming formula. Jim Sterling of Destructoid.com stated that the game has aged poorly since its initial release and cited the lack of support for DualShock thumbsticks, a poor camera as well as substandard jumping and spinning controls.|$|E

It greatly lessened {{the profits}} of the American markets to English {{manufacturers}} and merchants, to a degree which caused serious mercantile distress in that country. Moreover, the British nation was then in the first flush of enthusiasm over free trade, and, under the lead of extremists like Cobden and Gladstone, was inclined to regard a protective tariff as essentially and intrinsically immoral, scarcely less so than larceny or murder. Indeed, the tariff was seriously regarded as comparable in offensiveness with slavery itself, and Englishmen were inclined to condemn the North for the one {{as much as the}} South for the other. [...] "We do not like slavery," [...] said Palmerston to Adams, [...] "but we want cotton, and we dislike very <b>much</b> <b>your</b> Morrill tariff." ...|$|E

She has repeatedly explained in interviews that this is a misreading of her meaning, which skewers the superficiality of conspicuous consumption -- or more simply, that [...] "show-offs suck." [...] "For me, so much I hear about how much money people have and how people just take stuff too seriously. It’s not me saying that you can live for free, because obviously that isn’t the case; but I’m saying that you don’t always have to let it be about that.
