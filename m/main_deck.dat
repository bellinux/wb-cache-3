5|$|Both {{ships were}} rearmed {{in the late}} 1860s with 14 seven-inch and 2 eight-inch rifled muzzle-loading guns. The new guns were heavier so fewer could be carried. On both ships the eight-inch guns were mounted {{amidships}} on the <b>main</b> <b>deck</b> on the broadside {{and a pair of}} seven-inch guns were mounted on the upper deck as fore and aft chase guns. Eight of the remaining seven-inch guns were also placed on the <b>main</b> <b>deck</b> on the broadside where they were protected by the ship's armour, but one pair was on the <b>main</b> <b>deck</b> further aft where they were not protected by armour. The two ships differed where the last pair of seven-inch guns was positioned: Defence mounted them on the <b>main</b> <b>deck,</b> forward of the armour, while Resistance mounted hers on the upper deck.|$|E
5|$|In June 2008, All Nippon Airways took {{delivery}} of the first 767-300BCF (Boeing Converted Freighter), a modified passenger-to-freighter model. The conversion work was performed in Singapore by ST Aerospace Services, the first supplier to offer a 767-300BCF program, and involved {{the addition of a}} <b>main</b> <b>deck</b> cargo door, strengthened <b>main</b> <b>deck</b> floor, and additional freight monitoring and safety equipment. Since then, Boeing, Israel Aerospace Industries, and Wagner Aeronautical have also offered passenger-to-freighter conversion programs for 767-300 series aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Royal Oak was {{initially}} armed with 24 smoothbore, muzzle-loading 68-pounder {{guns on the}} <b>main</b> <b>deck</b> and 11 rifled breech-loading (RBL) Armstrong seven-inch, 110-pounder guns. Eight of these were also on the <b>main</b> <b>deck</b> {{and the other three}} served as chase guns on the upper deck, two at the bow and one aft.|$|E
50|$|The PS Murray Princess has 5 decks, 3 {{of which}} are {{passenger}} accommodation. The 4 <b>main</b> <b>decks</b> are named after important historical figures relevant the Murray River.|$|R
50|$|Above two vehicle decks, {{passenger}} accommodation is over two <b>main</b> <b>decks.</b> To create {{an air of}} luxury, there was large scale use of mahogany and brass. Over the years, many refits and overhauls ensured that the ships remained very comfortable.|$|R
50|$|While the VC-25 has two <b>main</b> <b>decks</b> and a cargo area, like {{a regular}} Boeing 747, its 4,000 square feet (370 m²) of floor space has been reconfigured for presidential duties. Its lowest level is mostly cargo space, {{carrying}} luggage and the onboard food supply.|$|R
5|$|The combi model, the 747-200M, {{could carry}} freight {{in the rear}} section of the <b>main</b> <b>deck</b> via a side cargo door. A {{removable}} partition on the <b>main</b> <b>deck</b> separated the cargo area at the rear from the passengers at the front. The -200M could carry up to 238 passengers in a three-class configuration with cargo carried on the <b>main</b> <b>deck.</b> The model was {{also known as the}} 747-200 Combi. As on the -100, a stretched upper deck (SUD) modification was later offered. A total of 10 converted 747-200s were operated by KLM. Union des Transports Aériens (UTA) also had two aircraft converted.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} eight 7-inch 45-caliber {{guns were}} distributed four per side, in casemates {{on the side}} of the ship, below the <b>main</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|E
5|$|The ship is memorialized at Sioux Falls, South Dakota, where memorabilia {{and parts}} of the {{battleship}} are displayed within an outline of the <b>main</b> <b>deck.</b> A screw from South Dakota is on display outside the U.S. Navy Museum in Washington, D.C.|$|E
50|$|While McCulloch was patrolling Ocean Station Bravo off {{the coast}} of Labrador, Canada, in January 1959, raging winter seas cracked her <b>main</b> <b>decks</b> and swept one crewman overboard. In spite of that {{harrowing}} experience, she managed to reach Naval Station Argentia in Newfoundland, Canada, without further mishap.|$|R
50|$|Repair and {{maintenance}} jobs on offshore rigs are undertaken at Alcock; jackets up to 80 m length and 2,200-tonne weight can be constructed. At Nhava, jackets up to 80 m length and 2,300-tonne weight, <b>main</b> <b>decks</b> up to 550 Tonne weight and helipads of 160-tonne weight can be constructed.|$|R
500|$|The {{waterline}} belt of the Svetlana-class ships was 76millimeters thick. It {{extended the}} whole {{length of the}} hull and covered from the lower deck to [...] below the waterline. Above it was a [...] strake of armor that covered the area between the lower and <b>main</b> <b>decks.</b> Those decks were each [...] thick and the funnel uptakes were protected by 25millimeters of armor. The walls of the conning tower were 76millimeters thick while the gun shields protecting the 130-millimeter guns were 25millimeters thick.|$|R
5|$|At {{some point}} in the war, the <b>main</b> <b>deck</b> six-inch guns of the Devonshire-class ships were moved to the upper deck and given gun shields. Their casemates were plated over to improve {{seakeeping}} and the four 3-pounder guns displaced by the transfer were landed.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1915, the <b>main</b> <b>deck</b> 6-inch guns of the Monmouth-class {{ships were}} moved to the upper deck and given gun shields; their casemates were plated over to improve the ships' seakeeping. The 12-pounder guns {{displaced}} by the transfer were repositioned elsewhere. At {{some point in the}} war, three 3-pounder anti-aircraft guns were installed on the upper deck.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{successful}} debut, 757 sales remained stagnant {{for most of}} the 1980s, a consequence of declining fuel prices and a shift to smaller aircraft in the post-deregulation U.S. market. Although no direct competitor existed, 150-seat narrow-bodies such as the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 were cheaper to acquire and carried nearly as many passengers as some airlines' 757s. A three-year sales drought abated in November 1983 when Northwest Airlines placed orders for 20 aircraft, which averted a costly production rate decrease. In December 1985, a freighter model, the , was announced following a launch order for 20 aircraft from UPS Airlines, and in February 1986, a freighter-passenger combi model, the , was launched with an order for one aircraft from Royal Nepal Airlines. The freighter model included a <b>main</b> <b>deck</b> cargo hold and entered service with UPS in September 1987. The combi model could carry both cargo and passengers on its <b>main</b> <b>deck</b> and entered service with Royal Nepal Airlines in September 1988.|$|E
500|$|The {{ship was}} {{initially}} armed with 24 seven-inch rifled muzzle-loading (RML) guns. Four pairs of guns were positioned as {{fore and aft}} chase guns on the upper and <b>main</b> <b>decks.</b> The remaining 16 guns were mounted on the broadside amidships. The [...] gun weighed [...] and fired a [...] shell that was able penetrate [...] of armour.|$|R
500|$|The {{ships were}} {{armed with a}} battery of one [...] rifled muzzle-loading (RML) Armstrong gun and {{fourteen}} [...] RML Armstrongs. These were supplemented with ten 36-pounder guns, also manufactured by Armstrong. The 229mm gun {{was placed on the}} upper deck, forward, {{and the rest of the}} guns were mounted on each broadside on the upper and <b>main</b> <b>decks.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{waterline}} belt of the Svetlana-class ships was 76 millimeters thick. It {{extended the}} whole {{length of the}} hull and covered from the lower deck to 3 ft below the waterline. Above it was a 25 mm strake of armor that covered the area between the lower and <b>main</b> <b>decks.</b> Those decks were each 20 mm thick and the funnel uptakes were protected by 25 millimeters of armor. The walls of the conning tower were 76 millimeters thick while the gun shields protecting the 130-millimeter guns were 25 millimeters thick.|$|R
5|$|The 757-200SF, a {{conversion}} of passenger 757-200s for cargo use, entered service with DHL Aviation in 2001. Modifications by Boeing Wichita in Kansas included {{the removal of}} passenger amenities, <b>main</b> <b>deck</b> structural reinforcement, and the installation of a 757-200PF forward fuselage section with a port-side cargo door. The forward two entry doors are retained, resulting in a <b>main</b> <b>deck</b> cargo capacity of 14 pallets, which is one less than the 757-200PF. Environmental controls can be fitted for animal cargo, and rear exits and window pairs are retained on some aircraft. Besides Boeing, Israel Aerospace Industries, Precision Conversions, and ST Aerospace Services have also handled 757-200SF conversions. In September 2006, FedEx Express announced a US$2.6billion plan to acquire over 80 converted 757 freighters to replace its 727 fleet.|$|E
5|$|The {{armament}} of the Hector-class ships {{was intended}} to be 32 smoothbore, muzzle-loading 68-pounder guns, 15 on each side on the <b>main</b> <b>deck</b> and one each fore and aft as chase guns on the upper deck. This was modified during construction to four rifled 110-pounder breech-loading guns and twenty-four 68-pounders. The breech-loading guns were a new design from Armstrong and much was hoped for them. To partially alleviate their overweight condition, the ships were not fully armed and only received four 110-pounders on the upper deck and twenty 68-pounders on the <b>main</b> <b>deck</b> behind armour. Firing tests carried out in September 1861 against an armoured target, however, proved that the 110-pounder was inferior to the 68-pounder smoothbore gun in armour penetration and repeated incidents of breech explosions during the Battles for Shimonoseki and the Bombardment of Kagoshima in 1863–64 caused the navy to withdraw the gun from service shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|The {{armament}} of the Warrior-class ships {{was intended}} to be 40 smoothbore, muzzle-loading 68-pounder guns, 19 on each side on the <b>main</b> <b>deck</b> and one each fore and aft as chase guns on the upper deck. This was modified during construction to ten rifled 110-pounder breech-loading guns, twenty-six 68-pounders, and four rifled breech-loading 40-pounder guns.|$|E
50|$|The {{ship was}} {{initially}} armed with 24 seven-inch rifled muzzle-loading (RML) guns. Four pairs of guns were positioned as {{fore and aft}} chase guns on the upper and <b>main</b> <b>decks.</b> The remaining 16 guns were mounted on the broadside amidships. The 7 in gun weighed 6.5 LT and fired a 112 lb shell that was able penetrate 7.7 in of armour.|$|R
50|$|The {{ships were}} {{armed with a}} battery of one 229 mm rifled muzzle-loading (RML) Armstrong gun and {{fourteen}} 203 mm RML Armstrongs. These were supplemented with ten 36-pounder guns, also manufactured by Armstrong. The 229 mm gun {{was placed on the}} upper deck, forward, {{and the rest of the}} guns were mounted on each broadside on the upper and <b>main</b> <b>decks.</b>|$|R
500|$|The entire {{side of the}} Minotaur-class ships was {{protected}} by wrought iron armour that tapered from [...] at the ends to [...] amidships, except for {{a section of the}} bow between the upper and <b>main</b> <b>decks.</b> The armour extended [...] below the waterline. A single 5.5-inch transverse bulkhead protected the forward chase guns on the upper deck. The armour was backed by [...] of teak.|$|R
5|$|The {{freighter}} {{features a}} large, upward-opening <b>main</b> <b>deck</b> cargo door on its forward port-side fuselage. Adjacent to this large cargo door is an exit door {{used by the}} pilots. All other emergency exits are omitted, and cabin windows and passenger amenities are not available. The <b>main</b> <b>deck</b> cargo hold has a smooth fiberglass lining, and a fixed rigid barrier with a sliding access door serves as a restraint wall next to the flight deck. Both lower holds can be equipped with a telescoping baggage system to load custom-fitted cargo modules. When equipped for extended-range transatlantic operations, UPS's 757-200PFs feature an upgraded auxiliary power unit, additional cargo bay fire suppression equipment, enhanced avionics, and an optional supplemental fuel tank in the aft lower hold. Total production for the 757-200PF totaled 80 aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{intended}} armament of Achilles changed no {{less than}} five times before it was finally mounted. She received four rifled 110-pounder breech-loading guns mounted on the upper deck, two of which served as chase guns at the bow and stern, and 16 smoothbore, muzzle-loading 100-pounder Somerset cannon, eight on each side on the <b>main</b> <b>deck.</b> The breech-loading guns were a new design from Armstrong and much was hoped for them. Firing tests carried out in September 1861 against an armoured target, however, proved that the 110-pounder was inferior to the 68-pounder smoothbore gun in armour penetration and repeated incidents of breech explosions during the Battles for Shimonoseki and the Bombardment of Kagoshima in 1863–64 caused the navy to withdraw the gun from service shortly afterwards. In 1865, six 68-pounder smoothbores were added, three {{on each side of}} the <b>main</b> <b>deck,</b> although she was not comprehensively rearmed until her 1868 refit.|$|E
5|$|Her main {{armament}} {{consisted of}} six BL 9.2-inch Mk X guns in single turrets, {{two on the}} centreline and two on each beam, giving a broadside of four 9.2 in guns. Her secondary armament of ten BL 6-inch Mark XI guns was arranged in single casemates. They were mounted amidships on the <b>main</b> <b>deck</b> and were only usable in calm weather. Twenty Vickers QF 3-pounders were fitted, six on turret roofs and fourteen in the superstructure. The ship also mounted three submerged 18-inch torpedo tubes.|$|E
50|$|Although {{hampered}} {{in their}} rescue {{efforts by the}} necessity to pursue sound contacts and by alarms over real and imagined periscope sightings, PC-803 and PC-804 quickly came {{to the aid of}} survivors in the water and on the slowly sinking aft section. On board Underhill, the wounded were brought to the boat and <b>main</b> <b>decks,</b> while unhurt survivors aided the injured and attempted to control the damage.|$|R
50|$|There {{is also a}} Super Mini Top Trumps of Disney Pixar, Cars, SpongeBob SquarePants, Star Wars and Baby Animals. These are {{exclusive}} to Poundland. The cards {{are similar to the}} <b>main</b> <b>decks</b> but there are only 20 cards, 14 of which are playable, 1 instruction card, 4 advert/trivia cards and a title card. The cards also have one less stat than the main pack.|$|R
5000|$|Motor Princess had a <b>main</b> car <b>deck</b> {{as well as}} {{space for}} cars on the front half of the upper deck, {{connected}} to the <b>main</b> car <b>deck</b> with a ramp. She was a wooden-hulled vessel and the first diesel powered vessel in CPs fleet. She had a cruising speed of 14.5 knots. (Turner, 129) Robert Turner describes the passenger amenities in his book, [...] "The Pacific Princesses": ...|$|R
5|$|The 757-200M, a {{convertible}} version {{capable of carrying}} cargo and passengers on its <b>main</b> <b>deck,</b> entered service with Royal Nepal Airlines in 1988. Also known as the 757-200 Combi, the type retains the passenger windows and cabin doors of the 757-200, while adding a forward port-side cargo door {{in the manner of}} the 757-200PF. Kathmandu-based Royal Nepal Airlines, later renamed Nepal Airlines, included the convertible model as part of an order for two 757s in 1986.|$|E
5|$|The 767-200 ceased {{production}} in the late 1980s, superseded by the extended-range 767-200ER. Some early 767-200s were subsequently upgraded to extended-range specification. In 1998, Boeing began offering 767-200 conversions to 767-200SF (Special Freighter) specification for cargo use, and Israel Aerospace Industries has been licensed to perform cargo conversions since 2005. The conversion process entails the installation of a side cargo door, strengthened <b>main</b> <b>deck</b> floor, and added freight monitoring and safety equipment. The 767-200SF was positioned {{as a replacement for}} Douglas DC-8 freighters.|$|E
5|$|The Nagato {{class was}} {{equipped}} with a unique heptapodal (seven-legged) mast designed to maximize rigidity for range-finding purposes and survivability under shellfire. It consisted of a thick vertical leg in the center surrounded by six outer legs. The central leg was {{large enough to accommodate}} an electric elevator running between the foretop and <b>main</b> <b>deck.</b> In November 1944, the tops of Nagatos mainmast and funnel were removed to improve the arcs of fire for her anti-aircraft guns.|$|E
50|$|The Binghamton was {{acquired}} in 1969 by Edward Russo, an Edgewater, NJ contractor, for conversion into a restaurant. Russo planned large dining {{rooms on the}} Upper and <b>Main</b> <b>decks,</b> plus two pubs in the former engine room. He leased a berth at Edgewater, NJ, and scheduled a grand opening for Labor Day, 1970. But a tug strike and delays in dredging her berth at Edgewater indefinitely postponed these plans.|$|R
50|$|The entire {{side of the}} Minotaur-class ships was {{protected}} by wrought iron armour that tapered from 4.5 in at the ends to 5.5 in amidships, except for {{a section of the}} bow between the upper and <b>main</b> <b>decks.</b> The armour extended 5 ft below the waterline. A single 5.5-inch transverse bulkhead protected the forward chase guns on the upper deck. The armour was backed by 10 in of teak.|$|R
