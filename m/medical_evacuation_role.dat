25|$|The NH90 {{featured}} {{an advanced}} composite airframe, designed for ballistic tolerance, {{a high level}} of crashworthiness, lower weight, and 30 per cent greater endurance than a metallic counterpart. The four main rotor blades are also composed of composite materials, increasing fatigue strength and lifespan while providing for greater damage tolerance. The unobstructed main cabin area is entered either by large sliding doors {{on either side of the}} fuselage or via a rear ramp, the cabin is designed to accommodate modular equipment packages to enable the rotorcraft to be rapidly reconfigured, providing for operational flexibility. In a troop-transport capacity, the cabin can accommodate up to 20 fully equipped soldiers, or up to 12 stretchers in a <b>medical</b> <b>evacuation</b> <b>role,</b> some light vehicles may also be transported; the main cabin is equipped with environmental control systems and sound proofing measures to improve passenger conditions.|$|E
25|$|In July 2012, the German NH90 fleet {{reached a}} {{combined}} total of 5,000 flight hours. In April 2013, up to 4 German Army NH90 TTH were deployed in Afghanistan in a Forward Air <b>Medical</b> <b>Evacuation</b> <b>role</b> {{in support of}} coalition forces operating in the country. On 23 June 2013, German Army NH90s were declared operationally capable of medical evacuation operations. Following an engine failure and controlled crash in Uzbekistan in July 2014, the German Army temporarily grounded the type for investigation. In December 2015, {{it was announced that}} production of the German Navy's variant of the NH90 NFH, named Sea Lion, had formally commenced; a refit of the German Army's TTH variant was also underway at the same time. Since late 2014, Germany has promoted the establishment of a multinational NH90 force for combat MEDEVAC missions, the taskforce may comprise up to 20 NH90s.|$|E

5000|$|In 1949, Neel chaired a {{board that}} tested, evaluated, and {{recommended}} {{the use of}} the helicopter in <b>medical</b> <b>evacuation</b> <b>roles.</b> [...] The concept of utilizing rotary wing aircraft for the evacuation of seriously wounded casualties was not a new one. In 1936, at the Medical Field Service School at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania, an autogyro was field-tested as an evacuation vehicle. The idea was discarded at that time for engineering and budgetary reasons more than any defect in the basic concept. During World War II the Air Force and Navy began to use helicopters for the rescue of pilots and other personnel lost at sea or in inaccessible terrain.|$|R

50|$|On 1 May 2014, the House Armed Services Committee Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee {{passed its}} markup of the FY 2015 budget. Language {{pertaining}} to the AMPV approved 80 percent of requested funding, but would withhold 20 percent until the Army submitted {{a report on the}} program by 1 May 2015. The report requests a study on replacing M113 vehicles in formations separate from frontline fighting, rather than just in armored brigades, and the feasibility of a wheeled vehicle being used for the <b>medical</b> <b>evacuation</b> <b>role.</b> This works into General Dynamics' suggestion of a split buy, using tracked Bradley-type vehicles for mobility missions while having wheeled Strykers as an armored ambulance and for support vehicle missions not assigned to combat brigades. Although a split buy may be considered, with lower-mobility vehicles serving in rear-echelon units outside of armored brigades, the Army is unlikely to procure a mix of tracked and wheeled armored vehicles within an ABCT itself due to risk of mobility differences hindering cross-country maneuvering and mechanical differences increasing maintenance demands. General Dynamics claims that using the Stryker medical evacuation vehicle would save $2 billion in life cycle costs and that it is smoother and quicker than a tracked vehicle in the role.|$|E
