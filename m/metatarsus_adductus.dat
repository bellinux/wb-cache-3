40|$|<b>Metatarsus</b> <b>adductus</b> is a {{deformity}} {{located at}} Lisfranc’s joint in a pure transverse plane. It is spontaneously corrected {{for the majority}} of newborns. In rare toddler cases, it demonstrates a clinical stiffness and results in Z-shaped foot, where valgus of the heel creates equilibration of resistant <b>metatarsus</b> <b>adductus.</b> Although, recurrent <b>metatarsus</b> <b>adductus</b> varus is observed in treated idiopathic clubfeet, usually in children over three years, but presence of heel's valgus is related to the surgical overcorrection of the heel’s varus. Conservative treatment is advocated in flexible <b>metatarsus</b> <b>adductus.</b> Surgery is performed after conservative treatment fail, and in walking patient. Soft tissue releases, osteotomies of metatarsals and lateral epiphysiodesis of the metatarsal base gave good results on short term, but deformity recurrence and foot growth disturbance couldn't be avoided. Although, osteotomies carried out proximal to the Lisfranc's joint: opening wedge osteotomy of medial cuneiform, calcaneocuboid fusion and the anterior resection of calcaneus, gave permanent correction, but they act only on one of the sides of deformity. Therfore, the theory of elongated lateral column associated with a shortened medial column is crucial in dealing with this deformity: combining opening wedge osteotomy of cuneiform with closing wedge osteotomy of cuboid described by Jawish et al. in children after 4 years allows in all causes of <b>metatarsus</b> <b>adductus</b> stiffness a lateral shifting of forefoot. Concerning the associated heel’s valgus, it is corrected in Z-shaped foot after the double osteotomy cuneiform/ cuboid.

40|$|As the {{processes}} of pseudohypertrophic muscular dystrophy advance, contractures about joints in the lower extremities progress until an unstable base of support secondary to equinovarus and weakened pelvic balance produced by hip flexion prohibit ambulation. Properly timed surgery and bracing have helped some patients to extend significantly their ability to ambulate. Because severe weakness can result from prolonged restraint, opera-tive procedures must permit immediate mobilization without fear of excessive pain or wound dehiscence. The primary aims of surgery are to maintain standing balance and prolong independent ambulation. Conditions requiring surgical correction are lower extremity flexion contracture, <b>metatarsus</b> <b>adductus,</b> and rigid forefoot equinocavovarus.

Charts of normal values and values with two standard deviations for each component of the torsional profile are available. In most cases, the abnormality improves with time.

40|$|OBJECTIVE. To {{review the}} {{aetiology}} {{and management of}} intoeing. DATA SOURCES. Medline and non-Medline literature search, and personal experience. STUDY SELECTION. Studies that provided evidence-based information about the aetiology and management of paediatric intoeing gait were selected. DATA EXTRACTION. Data were extracted and reviewed independently by both authors. DATA SYNTHESIS. An intoeing gait affects many children and, as with flexible flatfoot, bowleg, and knock-knee, it {{falls into the category}} of physiological problems that occur in normal children. The usual causes are excessive femoral anteversion, internal tibial torsion, and <b>metatarsus</b> <b>adductus.</b> Management is based on understanding the causes and the natural course of the condition and the effectiveness of various treatment modalities. Unfortunately, due to poor understanding of the condition, intoeing is commonly overtreated with braces or special footwear. CONCLUSIONS. Intoeing {{is one of the most}} common conditions encountered in paediatric orthopaedic practice. It is important to make an early diagnosis of pathological causes of intoeing such as cerebral palsy and developmental dysplasia of the hips so that treatment can be commenced as soon as possible. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|Background: Although the {{developmental}} dysplasia {{of the hip}} (DDH) is well known to pediatric orthopedists, its etiology has still remained unknown and despite dedication of {{a vast majority of}} research, the results are still inadequate and confusing. The exact incidence of DDH and its relationship with known risk factors in Iran is still unknown. Here we represent the results of one year study on the incidence and related conditions of DDH. Methods: Sonography was performed on the hip joints of 1073 full term healthy newborns at Imam Khomeini Hospital from March 2013 to March 2014. The results were classified according to Graf’s classification. Pathologic hips were cross checked by the known risk factors for DDH. Results: A significant correlation was found between DDH and breech presentation (P= 0. 000), torticollis (P= 0. 004), <b>metatarsus</b> <b>adductus</b> (P= 0. 024).

40|$|MONITORING OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ANATOMICAL CONDITIONS IN MODERN TREATMENT OF CONGENITAL FOOT DEFORMITIES SUMMARY This {{dissertation}} {{discusses the}} {{questions related to}} the solution of residual defects after treatment of congenital clubfoot, mainly residual <b>metatarsus</b> <b>adductus.</b> The records of our patiens were divided into parts, namely historical and comparitive. In the historical part patients operated by basal osteotomy of I. - V. metatarsal (Berman - Gartland) and patients operated by transfer of anterior tibialis tendon were evaluated. The comparitive group comprised of patients operated by a double tarsal wedge osteotomy {{or a combination of}} medial cuneiform osteotomy along with basal osteotomy of II. - V. metatarsal. From 1996 - 2013, we operated a total of 58 children (39 boys, 19 girls) with residual deformity of the forefoot. A total of 66 feet were operated upon. The mean age at the time of surgery was 6. 4 years (interval 3 - 20 years). In children older than 3 years with a flexible residual varus, transfer of tibialis anterior tendon to the outer aspect of foot was carried out. A total of 18 feet were operated upon by this technique. No postoperative complications were recorded. In two patients, for persistent postoperative residual deformity, basal osteotomy of I. - V. metatarsal (Berman - [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Conservatism in the {{treatment}} of congenital club-foot is well recog-nized. Brockman, in his monograph on the condition, states that only 50. 6 per cent. required no further treatment after adequate conservative care. Kite has practically standardized the conservative treatment. He states that 90 per cent. of all club feet can be corrected by the wedge-cast method. In some cases, however, the deformity does recur or resist con-servative methods of correction. The following is an end-result study of the transposition of the anterior tibial muscle tendon insertion in recurrent club-foot. Of the three components in congenital club-foot,-adduction of the forefoot at the talonavicular joint, inversion, and the equinus of the fore-foot {{as well as of the}} os calcis-inversion of the whole foot, but especially of the calcaneum, is the most important. Without complete correction of the inversion, correction of the deformity as a whole cannot be maintained. Residual <b>metatarsus</b> <b>adductus</b> is frequent after correction by any method. If the forefoot adduction is completely corrected, the inversion of the os calcis will be corrected in most instances.

40|$|Thirty-one {{patients}} (forty-five feet) who had <b>metatarsus</b> <b>adductus</b> {{were evaluated}} at our institution and were followed {{for an average}} of thirty-two years and six months. Of these thirty-one patients, twenty-one (thirty-one feet) were examined clinically and radiographically. Information on the remaining ten patients (fourteen feet) was obtained by letter or telephone, or both. Twelve patients (sixteen feet) who had a passively correctable deformity (mild or moderate) {{at the time of the}} initial presentation had no treatment. Twenty patients (twenty-nine feet) who had a partly flexible or rigid deformity (moderate or severe) at the time of the initial presentation were managed with serial manipulation and application of plaster holding casts.

The results were good in all sixteen of the untreated feet and in twenty-six (90 per cent) of the twenty-nine feet that had been conservatively treated. There were no poor results. The passively correctable deformities resolved spontaneously. Radiographs showed an obliquity of the medial cuneiform-metatarsal joint in twenty-one (68 per cent) of the thirty-one feet that were examined clinically and radiographically.

40|$|Background and Objective: Knowing the {{incidence}} of congenital extremity malformations in the neonates is important for which {{in the case of}} unrecognizd may lead to disability. There is not a definite data with respect of prevalence of congenital anomalies in Ahvaz,Iran. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess {{the incidence}} of congenital anomalies in two referral teaching hospitals. Subjects and Methods: This prospective study was performed with association of paediatric group, over a year from 2006 to 2007. All live births with a gestationl age of 28 - 42 weeks were evaluated for congenital abnormalities of the upper and lower limbs. Results: A total of 5087 live births were delivered by vaginal and cesarean section. Thirty newborns had abnormality in upper or lower extremities (5. 89 / 1000 live births). Among of these newborns, congenital clubfoot in 12 (M= 7, F= 5) newborn, hip dysplasia in 10 (F= 8,M= 2), hand polydactyly in 3 (F= 1, M= 2), <b>metatarsus</b> <b>adductus</b> in 2 female, bilateral hand and foot in 1 female, polydactyly in 1 female, hand syndactyly in 1 male and vertical talus in 1 male were observed.

40|$|Hallux abductovalgus (HAV) {{is common}} foot {{deformity}} {{that is known}} to predominate in women and is often assumed {{to be linked to}} the use of inappropriate footwear. The predominance of the deformity in females has been demonstrated through many surveys across different populations. The highest prevalence of the deformity reported found 44 per cent of women affect whilst the highest prevalence in men reported a prevalence of 22 per cent. Although the condition is seen less frequently in children and barefoot populations, the female foot is still affected twice as often as the male foot in such groups, weakening the theoretical association between the deformity and footwear. A review of 100 radiographs of male and female feet found an association between the functional angle of the metatarsal head and HAV deformity and found that the female metatarsal head is more rounded than the male metatarsal head. There was no difference in the degree of <b>metatarsus</b> <b>adductus</b> (MA) deformity between males and females but in females, when the MA angle was greater than normal (24 ') an abnormal HAV angle was always seen. A good association was seen between the proximal articular set angle and the HAV angle that was similar for males and females. A three dimensional study of 100 bone-sets was undertaken using a technique not previously applied to this field of study. The bones of the medial column (talus, navicular, medial cuneiform and 1 st metatarsal) were included. Several differences between in the shape of male and female foot bones were found including the more rounded metatarsal head shape in females. When the differences were considered together it was suggested that the medial column in the female foot would be more adducted that in the male foot and the resultant adducted position of the 1 st metatarsal would predispose the female foot to HAV deformity. A study of 226 children was undertaken to investigate if a relationship between hypermobility and HAV deformity existed. A new assessment tool for measuring lower limb joint hypermobility was developed initially. No association between HAV deformity and lower limb hypermobility was found in healthy children, but a significant association was identified in children diagnosed with joint hypermobility. In a study of foot pressure measurements in 61 children, significant differences in the amount of pressure placed through the hallux, the speed of loading of the 1 st metatarsal head and the position of the centre of force through the foot were found between males and females. Associations with the pressure measurements and increasing joint flexibility were only seen for extreme levels of hypermobility. No association between HAV and plantar pressure was found.
