5|$|He {{applied for}} another patent on an alloy he called {{stainless}} steel, {{now known as}} martensitic stainless steel. The Patent Office rejected his application {{saying that it was}} not a new alloy. Haynes conceded their point, but submitted a second application and supplied a sample showing the stainlessness of his alloy when created using his exact proportions of metals, and it was granted. At the urging of his wife, he created the first set of stainless steel silverware for her personal use. The first piece of stainless steel was forged by Homer Dan Farmer in Haynes laboratory. It was a large <b>meat</b> <b>knife</b> and was donated to the Haynes Museum by the family of Dan Heflin, grandson of Homer Dan Farmer. In later years he claimed to have created stainless steel because she did not enjoy polishing their silver tableware. British metallurgist Harry Brearley independently produced an identical alloy around the same time and applied for an American patent and found that one already existed. Brearley had also created other innovations for the metal, but they were of little value without the stainless steel patent. He sought out Haynes and the two decided to pool their findings in a single company to produce the alloy. Haynes sold his stainless steel patent in 1918 to the American Stainless Steel Company, a company Brearley had created with the assistance of investors in Pennsylvania. In exchange he and his estate received royalties on its production until the patent expired in 1930. The stock he received as payment allowed him to gain a seat among the company's board of directors and he installed his son, March, to represent him. The income from the transaction led Haynes to begin the accumulation of a large fortune.|$|E

5000|$|Granton knives have {{semi-circular}} scallops {{ground into}} the edge that alternate {{on either side}} of the knife and extend from the edge to the middle of the blade. This design was developed and patented in 1928 by Wm.Grant & Sons Ltd A similar design, kullenschliff (kulle is Swedish for hill (or -more likely- a misspelling of the German word [...] "Kuhle" [...] meaning [...] "hollow" [...] or [...] "deepening"); schliff meaning [...] "cut" [...] or grind in German), has oval scallops (kuhlen) hollowed-out of one or both sides of the blade above the edge. The Granton design is normally found on <b>meat</b> carving <b>knives</b> but have recently appeared on other types of knives, especially Western variations of the Japanese santoku. The indentations require a certain thickness, so they are more frequently used on thicker, softer blades, rather than on thin, hard ones.

40|$|Shiga toxing-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) are {{foodborne}} pathogens {{that cause}} mild or serious diseases {{and can lead}} to people death. This study reports the prevalence and characteristics of STEC O 157 and non-O 157 in commercial ground beef and environmental samples, including <b>meat</b> table, <b>knife,</b> <b>meat</b> mincing machine and manipulator hands (n= 450) obtained from 90 retail markets over a nine-month period. The STEC isolates were serotyped and virulence genes as stx (Shiga toxin), rfbO 157 (O 157 lipopolysaccharide), fliCH 7 (H 7 flagellin), eae (intimin), ehxA (enterohemolysin) and saa (STEC autoagglutinating adhesin), were determined. STEC O 157 were identified in 23 (25. 5 %) beef samples and 16 (4. 4 %) environmental samples, while STEC non-O 157 were present in 47 (52. 2 %) and 182 (50. 5 %), respectively. Among 54 strains isolated, 17 were STEC O 157 :H 7 and 37 were STEC non-O 157. The prevalent genotype for O 157 was stx 2 /eae/ehxA/fliCH 7 (83. 4 %), and for STEC non-O 157 the most frequent ones were stx 1 /stx 2 /saa/ehxA (29. 7 %); stx 2 (29. 7 %); and stx 2 /saa/ehxA (27 %). None of the STEC non-O 157 strains were eae-positive. Besides O 157 :H 7, other 20 different serotypes were identified, being O 8 :H 19, O 178 :H 19 and O 174 :H 28 the prevalent. Strains belonging to the same serotype could be isolated from different sources of the same retail market. Also, the same serotype could be detected in different stores. In conclusion, screening techniques are increasingly sensitive, but the isolation of STEC non-O 157 is still a challenge. Moreover, with the results obtained from the present work, although more studies are needed, cross-contamination between meat and the environment could be suspected...|$|R

5000|$|A Chinese chef's knife — {{sometimes}} referred to as a Caidao, which literally mean [...] "vegetable knife", [...] "Chinese cleaver" [...] or [...] "chopper"— is the rectangular-bladed, all-purpose knife traditionally used in China, Vietnam, Cambodia, and many other Asian countries to prepare a variety of meats, fish, and vegetables. The popularity of this style of knife has spread with the associated cuisines. They resemble Western cleavers in appearance, but most Chinese chef's knives are relatively thin-bladed and designed for slicing, chopping, and mincing vegetables, fish, and boneless meats.

5000|$|The Yakutian knife (саха быһаҕа, якутский нож), {{sometimes}} called the Yakut knife, is traditional knife of Yakuts (an ethnic group from the Sakha Republic (or Yakutia), region of Siberia), used for working with wood, hides, skins, fish and <b>meat.</b> The <b>knife</b> {{has been used in}} Yakutia for hundreds of years without significant changes in its design. [...] Typical Yakutian knives have a blade length of 4 - 7 in, and 1 - 1+1⁄2 in wide. The unique feature of this knife is that the blade is asymmetrical; one side of the blade has a groove in it and a chisel grind, while the other side has no groove and is basically a convex edge (meaning it rounds down to the edge, rather than having a straight bevel).The blade is traditionally forged from locally sourced iron ore smelted by Yakutian blacksmiths. The knife handle is traditionally made from birch burl and is thick and egg-shaped in cross-section. It fits the hand and can also be used wearing gloves. The birch also protects the hand from the cold effects of the knife steel in extreme cold, a common condition in Siberia during winter months. The knife sheath is traditionally made from cow tail hide.|$|R

40|$|Abstract]: This {{research}} project sought to {{provide insight into}} the possible applications of solar thermal energy within the meat processing industry. This project is carried out in conjunction with Churchill Abattoir; with the view to develop a solar thermal alternative for producing heated water to cater in part for the needs of their operation whilst simultaneously providing refrigeration. In terms of an industry comparison, Churchill Abattoir is ranked approximately 25 - 30 th of 180 abattoirs nationwide and processes (i. e. slaughter, bone and butcher) around 2500 cattle per week. The meat processing industry has a high demand for heated water. Its uses vary from hand washing and laundry (congruent 43 degrees C) to sterilisation of equipment such as saws, <b>meat</b> hooks <b>knives</b> etc (> 83 degrees C). It also has high energy needs for refrigeration. A solar thermal system that could reduce energy costs in these areas would not only benefit Churchill Abattoir but may see further application within industry. Project aims include - Research current alternatives in solar thermal systems. - Establish design parameters. - Produce a conceptual solar thermal system. - Investigate the potential of such a system to cooling processes. The project began by researching the existing alternatives for system components such as energy collectors, solar tracking, chillers and heaters. Once the component variables and design parameters for a conceptual system had been established an initial design was proposed and analysed to determine its capabilities. As a result of the analysis components and sizes were selected for a real system that could be implemented at the abattoir. This project seeks ultimately to improve abattoir operations by reducing non-renewable energy use through the development of a solar thermal system. Its outcomes have the potential to benefit the wider industry...|$|R
40|$|The beef {{industry}} has made tremendous strides in reducing pathogen contamination on carcasses. Multiple antimicrobial interventions have been validated {{for their use}} during harvesting. Information in regards to cross-contamination with pathogens in the post-harvest environment is limited. Surrogate microorganisms for enteric pathogens are commonly used to validate antimicrobial interventions and might allow for the simulation of cross-contamination through the post-harvest environment. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine how the post-harvest environment impacts the direct and indirect transmission of pathogens. This was achieved by using fluorescent protein-marked surrogate strains of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella spp. from inoculated carcasses to the adjacent ones and to the equipment and facility in three different abattoirs. Thirteen hide-on carcasses were inoculated using a gelatin-based slurry containing three nonpathogenic fluorescent protein-marked strains of E. coli biotype I. In order to determine direct and indirect cross-contamination, inoculated and adjacent carcasses were sampled (300 cm 2) during the harvesting process at different stages: after hide opening (AHO), prior to evisceration (PE), after evisceration (AE), after splitting (AS), and after final intervention (AFI). Environmental samples consisting of the floor, walls, and air were tested as well as personal equipment including gloves, boots, and aprons. Equipment including hand <b>knives,</b> air <b>knives,</b> <b>meat</b> hooks, hide puller and split saw were also sampled. Results showed evidence of cross-contamination between inoculated carcasses and the adjacent non-inoculated ones for all abattoirs. Although this occurred in all abattoirs, surrogate counts on carcasses were below detectable levels (< 1. 4 log CFU/cm 2) after antimicrobial interventions. Surrogates were found in low levels for all environmental samples. However surrogate counts from equipment such as <b>knives,</b> split saws, <b>meat</b> hooks, and hide puller were more frequently detected (15 percent) than those found on the floor, air and walls samples (10 percent). In the case of aprons, boots, and gloves, the prevalence of countable surrogate samples was 7 percent...|$|R
