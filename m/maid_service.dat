5|$|When he was five, Kanae and {{his mother}} joined Ichirō in Tokyo and settled in a {{tenement}} house in the San'ya area. His mother did sewing work to help support the family, and with her sister Tama provided <b>maid</b> <b>service</b> to the Mori household, and thus Kanae often met his younger cousin, Kaita Murayama, who, like Kanae, {{was to make a}} career in art. The painter Harada Naojirō, whom Ōgai had befriended when the two were studying in Germany, asked Kanae's mother, whom he had seen at the Mori household, to model for the painting Kannon Bodhisattva Riding the Dragon of 1890. Such occurrences may have contributed to attracting Kanae to art.|$|E
25|$|Canal Zone housing was {{constructed}} {{in the early days}} of construction, as part of Stevens' plans. Housing constructed for couples and families consisted of structures containing four two-story apartments. The units had corrugated-iron roofs, and were uniformly painted gray with white trim. Constructed of pine clapboard, they had long windows and high ceilings, allowing for air movement. Better-paid employees were entitled to more square feet of housing, the unit in which allowances were expressed. Initially, employees received one square foot per dollar of monthly salary. Stevens from the first encouraged gold roll employees to send for their wives and children; to encourage them to do so, wives were granted a housing allowance equal to their husband's, even if they were not employees. Bachelors mostly resided in hotel-like structures. The structures all had screened verandas and up-to-date plumbing. The government furnished power, water, coal for cooking, ice for iceboxes, lawn care, groundskeeping, garbage disposal, and, for bachelors only, <b>maid</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E

40|$|While <b>maid's</b> <b>services</b> are {{considered}} luxury goods in developed countries, {{that is not}} always the case in developing countries. Economists believe that {{the reason for that is}} the availability of cheap unskilled labor supply in developing countries. However, few attention has been given to the scarcity of durable goods used in home-production in developing countries households. The same durable goods that {{are considered}} necessity on developed countries. This paper investigates the role of women's bar- gaining power, women's shadow price of time, and family composition in deciding on expenditures in production durable goods and <b>maid's</b> <b>services.</b> The test of bargaining power indicates that the expenditure on home-production factors is an outcome of a bargaining process. Households in which the wife has higher schooling than husband, the relative probability of having <b>maid's</b> <b>services</b> is higher. The results of the dierence of husbands' and wives' education are consistent with the intrahousehold time allocation, where wives that have comparative advantage in market work are more likely to substitute market goods for home-production. Wives that do not have comparative advantage in market work specialize in home- production, demanding more time-saving durable goods. There is no evidence of parental preferences for sons or daughters. However, there is evidence that daughters' time substitutes wives's time and <b>maid's</b> <b>services</b> in home-production. Intrahousehold allocation, durable goods ownership, <b>maid's</b> <b>services,</b> parental preferences...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{composed}} of three papers in which the research questions {{are related to the}} double burden that accrues to Brazilian women. The first and second papers address this issue by looking at expenditure decisions about home production. The first paper examines whether the expenditure decisions about production goods, such as white appliances, relative to entertainment goods, such as TVs, are the outcome of a bargaining process between husbands and wives. The second paper looks at the demand for <b>maid</b> <b>services</b> and for production durable goods, examining the extent to which other household members substitute for <b>maid</b> <b>services</b> and durable goods in home production. The third paper addresses the effects of Brazilian women's double burden on their labor market participation by examining whether the occupational choice of Brazilian women is affected by their gender roles and whether entry into other occupations that are not identified as female occupations has become easier since the introduction of anti-discrimination laws in the labor market. The first paper combines two Brazilian data sets: a Brazilian household expenditure survey, Pesquisa de Orçamento Familiares (POF), and a Brazilian household survey, Pesquisa Nacional Por Amostra de Domicílios (PNAD). The results of the first paper indicate that the decision about durable goods ownership is the outcome of a bargaining process between husband and wife. The test on the coefficients of the marriage market variable and the indicators of households in which only the wife and households in which only the husband makes expenditure decisions corroborate the expectations about wives' preferences for production goods. The same data sets as the first paper are used in the second paper. The finding of the second paper indicates that if the marriage market is favorable to women, that is if the ratio of women to men goes from 1. 07 to 0. 96, the increment in the household probability of owning at least one maid's substitute durable goods is equivalent to 24 % the impact of moving a household up one income quintile. Moreover, the results indicate that daughters' time substitutes for wives' time and <b>maid</b> <b>services</b> in home production. Parents may want daughters trained in home production to be able to perform their future role as wives. However, this training comes at a cost to daughters' investment in formal education, narrowing their future career options. The data used in the third paper come from a Brazilian household survey, Pesquisa Nacional Por Amostra de Domicílios (PNAD). Gender roles are responsible for women to choose female-dominated occupations, married women are 1. 14 times more likely to work in female-dominated occupations and having a child six years and older increases on average by 12 % the probability that women work in female-dominated occupations instead of genderintegrated occupations in 2001. However, it becomes easier for all types of women to enter into male-dominated and gender-integrated occupations in 2001 compared to 1981...|$|R
