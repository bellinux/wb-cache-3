5|$|After {{tying up}} Ms. Botz, the kids find all their {{telephones}} disabled (which Ms. Botz had done earlier) {{and go to}} a nearby payphone to alert the authorities. Meanwhile, Marge tries to call home to check up on the kids but because there is no answer, she and Homer decide to cancel their motel reservation and go home. They find Ms. Botz bound and gagged in front of the TV. Homer, thinking his children have gotten the best of another babysitter and unaware of her true identity, frees her and pays her handsomely. After advising Homer to keep both eyes on Bart, Ms. Botz makes a clean getaway, just seconds before the kids arrive with the police and news media to arrest her. As Bart tries to lead the police to the house, Homer attempts to berate him for his behavior towards Ms. Botz, only to be informed by a news reporter about Ms. Botz's true identity and that he just freed her. Realizing his mistake, a humiliated Homer attempts to save face by claiming he fought Botz and she escaped, then warning her on camera never to show her face to him again. Later that night, Homer moans about his blunder on TV, but Marge cheers him up by saying that if he raised three children who can hogtie a perfect stranger, he <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> something right.|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons creator Matt Groening {{responded to}} the {{criticism}} {{in an interview with}} TV Guide, in which he said he did [...] "research on the ecological damage caused by clear-cutting and over-logging [...] it's really appalling." [...] Jackie Lang, a timber industry activist in Salem who helped lead the protest against the Fox network and Groening, said she was appalled by Groening's response, and [...] "he will be sorry he ever made it." [...] Jake Hogan, supervising producer of the show, defended Groening: [...] " [...] are just little stories, little comedies—stories that make people laugh." [...] On October 15, 1991, Groening issued another statement the public, in which he said: [...] "So now a few lumber companies have joined the nuclear power industry, right-wing preachers and high-ranking Republicans in attacking The Simpsons. We <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> something right. I must point out The Simpsons is a cartoon show—not 60 Minutes. Later in the show, the same lobbyist proposed drilling for oil in Teddy Roosevelt's head at Mount Rushmore. Please don't tell the oil companies about this." ...|$|E
500|$|The sudden {{surge in}} {{popularity}} was disorienting to Iyall. [...] "It was frightening: {{we played a}} college in Santa Barbara, and {{there were all these}} blond people crowding the stage, and I thought 'These are the people who hated me in high school!' When you grow up being 'outside' – because I wasn't white, and I was fat, and always a bit of a free thinker – it was strange. It was like, 'uh-oh, I <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> something wrong – they like me!'" [...] Highly successful mainstream artists like Ann Wilson and Ric Ocasek were eager to meet the band. Ocasek extended an invitation to collaborate at his Synchro Sound studio in Boston. The recording sessions in Boston resulted in the Never Say Never EP in January 1982. The title track became (arguably) their best-known song and has remained synonymous with the band ever since. The song was also featured in the 1984 romantic teen drama Reckless. Additionally, the success of the single directly led to 415 Records signing a deal with Columbia Records, which elevated the indie label's roster to major-label status. Romeo Void released their second album, entitled Benefactor, in November 1982. The album appeared at No.119 on the Billboard 200. Benefactor was noticeably more commercial sounding than previous endeavors; the music was made more danceable and swearing was removed on the song [...] "Never Say Never". The different approach in the sound resulted in comparisons to Blondie, which Allmusic writer William Ruhlmann suggested was a deliberate attempt by Columbia. Iyall stated that there was more pressure to write sexually laced lyrics for Benefactor: [...] "I do like to be provocative, and I definitely have access to my sexuality, and as a topic I find it ripe, but I wasn't ever going to be a sex-pot diva, so that was kind of odd." [...] She also said there was pressure to produce more singles.|$|E

2500|$|In February 2017, Dave Meltzer {{wrote that}} WWE's push of Reigns [...] "will never end. Isn't that obvious by now". A month later, Meltzer {{reported}} that WWE's long term plans ("which obviously could change") for 2018's WrestleMania 34 was to [...] "once again build {{for a year}} and have the big coronation" [...] for Reigns, who would be a babyface (the heroic character) [...] "between now and then" [...] and beat Brock Lesnar for the WWE Universal title [...] "to fully replace John Cena as the lead babyface of the company". In a 2017 ESPN interview, Anoa'i said he did not view his boos [...] "as a negative", but as [...] "motivation". Anoa'i elaborated, [...] " [...] thousands of people are screaming, booing {{at the top of their}} lungs, and I'm the center of attention, so I <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> something right".

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 2009–10 season, Bryson {{was linked}} with a move to Hearts, who were managed by Jim Jefferies, who had signed Bryson when he was manager of Kilmarnock. Bryson said: [...] "we'll wait and see if {{anything}} materialises over the summer. Jim Jefferies signed me from Clyde and gave me my chance in the SPL and I'm grateful to him for that. I enjoyed working under him at Kilmarnock and wouldn't mind working under him again. Every player has ambitions to play at the highest level and I'm no different so we'll just wait and see if an offer comes in but I'm happy at Killie just now." [...] Hearts were prepared to offer £300,000 but Kilmarnock valued Bryson at closer to £500,000 and talks between the two clubs collapsed. Hearts turned their attention to their former midfielder Paul Hartley, whose contract with English Championship club Bristol City was about to expire. However, they dropped their interest in Hartley after he refused to distance himself from criticism of Hearts' majority shareholder Vladimir Romanov during his first stint with the club. Hearts thus turned their attention back to Bryson and gave Kilmarnock a final [...] "take-it-or-leave-it" [...] offer, which included a [...] "significant sell-on clause" [...] but not an increased transfer fee. The offer was rejected. Hearts returned with two more bids on transfer deadline day, which were also rejected. Bryson said that he was [...] "relieved the window has now closed... It's nice that other clubs want you, it shows you <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> well, but it's not to be just now and I'll carry on doing well for Kilmarnock." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{significant}} {{exception to}} the basic framework for indirect discrimination is found for the issue of equal pay between men and women. Because the Equal Pay Act 1970 preceded other legislation, {{and so did the}} TFEU article 157, {{there has always been a}} separate body of rules. It is not entirely clear why this should continue, particularly because in several respects it is harder to bring equal pay claims on grounds of gender than for other protected characteristics, meaning that the task of closing the gender pay gap is frustrated compared to race, sexual orientation or other grounds. First, a claim must relate to [...] "pay", concept which is generally construed widely to encompass any kind of remuneration for work, as well as sick pay or for maternity leave. Second, under the EA 2010 section 79, a comparator must be real, and employed by the same employer, or an associated employer, and at the same establishment, or a different establishment if common terms apply. It is usually harder to find a real comparator than imagine a hypothetical one. Third, under EA 2010 section 65, the claimant <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> [...] "broadly similar" [...] work to the comparator, or work [...] "rated as equivalent", or work which is of [...] "equal value". These criteria, which at their broadest focus on the [...] "value" [...] of labour, make explicit what a court must take into account, but also potentially constrain the court in a way that the open ended test for indirect discrimination does not. Fourth, under section 128 there is a time limit of six months to bring a claim, but unlike the three-month time limit for other discrimination claims it cannot be extended at the court's discretion. However, equal pay claims do import an [...] "equality clause" [...] into the claimant's contract of employment. This allows a claim to be pursued in the High Court as well as a Tribunal. It is unclear what principle justifies the segregation of unequal pay claims based on sex, compared to all other protected characteristics.|$|E
