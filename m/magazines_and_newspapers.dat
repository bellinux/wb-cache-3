5|$|After {{returning}} to Puerto Rico in 1859, Betances established {{a very successful}} surgery and ophthalmology practice in Mayagüez. Even fierce political enemies such as Spanish pro-monarchy journalist José Pérez Morís regarded Betances as the best surgeon in Puerto Rico at the time. His good reputation in Puerto Rico would survive his stay in the island nation for many years. In 1895, while Betances was living in Paris, the manufacturers of the Emulsión de Scott (a codfish liver oil product that is still sold today, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline in modern times), paid an endorsement fee to Betances to have him appear on advertisements on Spanish language <b>magazines</b> <b>and</b> <b>newspapers</b> all over New York City and the Caribbean, based on his solid reputation as a doctor.|$|E

On {{the basis of}} materials gathered on his journey to East Africa and South Africa in 1882/’83, he had held public lectures throughout the Netherlands and Belgium. He also published articles on his trip in Dutch <b>magazines</b> <b>and</b> <b>newspapers,</b> and collated these publications into a book titled Zuid-Afrika. It made him somewhat of a celebrity, {{and an expert on}} South Africa and East Africa. During his journey Muller had also collected a large number of ethnographic objects and artefacts, on which he published a richly illustrated study in 1892, together with Joh. F. Snelleman, curator of the Africa collection in the Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde (National Museum of Ethnology) in Leiden.|$|E

5|$|As Anderson {{remained}} {{throughout her}} life evasive {{about the details}} of her life as a commercial writer, it is not known when she began writing commercially under pseudonyms, what those pseudonyms were, or, indeed, how much she wrote. She revealed only that she began writing for <b>magazines</b> <b>and</b> <b>newspapers</b> out of commercial necessity, and rarely under her own name. Although she achieved success later in this field, she sometimes stated that, as her writing improved, her pieces were more frequently turned down for publication. In her thirties, she began to write for commercial radio. Beginning with half-hour slots, Anderson gradually became interested in the technique of crafting radio plays, and began submitting some of her better work to the ABC under her own name. She later ascribed her fondness for writing the expansive dialogue in her novels to her early experience writing radio plays.|$|E

5|$|Narayan's next novel, The Man-Eater of Malgudi, was {{published}} in 1961. The book was reviewed as having a narrative that is a classical art form of comedy, with delicate control. After the launch of this book, the restless Narayan once again took to travelling, and visited the U.S. and Australia. He spent three weeks in Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne giving lectures on Indian literature. The trip was funded by a fellowship from the Australian Writers' Group. By this time Narayan had also achieved significant success, both literary and financial. He had a large house in Mysore, and wrote in a study with no fewer than eight windows; he drove a new Mercedes-Benz, a luxury in India at that time, to visit his daughter who had moved to Coimbatore after her marriage. With his success, both within India and abroad, Narayan started writing columns for <b>magazines</b> <b>and</b> <b>newspapers</b> including The Hindu and The Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War Dahl was a {{pilot in}} the Royal Air Force (RAF) until he crashed in the Libyan desert; the {{subsequent}} injuries left him unfit to fly. He was posted to Washington as an assistant air attaché, ostensibly a diplomatic post, but which also included espionage and propaganda work. In 1942 the writer C.S. Forester asked him to provide details of his experiences in North Africa which Forester hoped to use {{in an article in}} The Saturday Evening Post. Instead of the notes which Forester expected, Dahl sent a finished story for which he was paid $900. The work led to The Gremlins, a serialised story in Cosmopolitan about a mischievous and fictional RAF creature, the gremlin; the work was published as Dahl's first novel in 1943. Dahl continued to write short stories, although these were all aimed at the adult market. They were sold to <b>magazines</b> <b>and</b> <b>newspapers,</b> and were later compiled into collections, the first of which was published in 1946. Dahl began to make up bedtime stories for the children, and these formed the basis of several of his stories. His first children's novel, James and the Giant Peach, was published in 1961, which was followed, along with others, by Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (1964), Fantastic Mr Fox (1970), Danny, the Champion of the World (1975), The BFG (1982) and Matilda in 1988.|$|E
