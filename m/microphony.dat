50|$|Unlike {{solid-state}} devices, valves are assemblies {{of mechanical}} parts whose arrangement determines their functioning, and which cannot be totally rigid. If a valve is jarred, {{either by the}} equipment being moved or by acoustic vibrations from the loudspeakers, or any sound source, it will produce an output signal, {{as if it were}} some sort of microphone (the effect is consequently called <b>microphony).</b> All valves are subject to this to some extent; low-level voltage amplifier valves for audio are designed to be resistant to this effect, with extra internal supports. The EF86 mentioned in the context of noise is also designed for low <b>microphony,</b> though its high gain makes it particularly susceptible.|$|E

5000|$|ARLA {{was formed}} by Mann, vocal artist Juliana Snapper, filmmaker Vera Brunner-Sung, and {{choreographer}} Kristen Smiarowski. ARLA is a flexiable acronym for Audile Receptives Los Angeles or A Ripe Little Archive. The group came together to study scores and techniques of listening developed by composer Pauline Oliveros. ARLA led workshops, listening sessions, discussion groups and did several performances most notably at Occupy LA and the Getty Museum. ARLA also published the People's <b>Microphony</b> Song Book, a book of performance scores that utilize the Peoples Microphone. When asked about how she felt about her scores being re-performed Pauline Oliveros said [...] "I am happy that Elana Mann chose to use my Sonic Meditations for the People’s <b>Microphony</b> project.

50|$|The EF86 is {{much less}} noisy than other pentodes, but {{slightly}} noisier than some triodes at about 2 µV equivalent input noise to 10 kHz.

It is very similar electrically to the octal base EF37A and the Rimlock base EF40. Unlike many pentodes it was designed specifically for audio applications, low noise and low <b>microphony</b> being claimed advantages, although a rubber-mounted vibration-resistant base was still recommended. It has much higher stage gain than any triode, which makes it susceptible to <b>microphony.</b> The EF86 was used in many preamplifier designs during the last decades of vacuum tube hi-fi development. An industrial variant of the tube is known as 6267. In the former Soviet Union a variant was also produced as type 6Zh32P (Russian: 6Ж32П.)

50|$|Special quality tubes were {{sometimes}} identified {{by placing the}} numerical part of the designation between the heater rating and the tube type. The special quality could be anything, from rugged designs for military and industrial use, through devices with exceptionally low noise and <b>microphony,</b> to designs primarily optimised for long life without cathode poisoning when used for switching in a digital computer (but not necessarily with exceptional qualities as an amplifier). For example, an ECC81 manufactured as a special quality (SQ) tube would usually be designated 'E81CC'. The system was not universal as other special quality designation systems existed. An EF91 in its special quality version was designated 'M8083' (the 'M' meant Military) as {{in this case the}} standard EF91 was derived from the M8083 military design. Also, the SQ tube was not always designed for the same tasks or given the same Maximum Ratings (for example the E80F was more suitable for audio and electrometer applications, lacking the RF screening of the EF80, with anode and screen grid power ratings roughly half the EF80.|$|E
5000|$|Mikrophonie I (Work Number 15), for tamtam, 2 microphones, 2 filters, and controllers, is {{an example}} of moment form, {{polyvalent}} form, variable form, and process composition. It consists of 33 structural units, or [...] "moments", which can be ordered {{in a number of different}} ways, according to a [...] "connection scheme" [...] specifying the relationships between successive moments by a combination of three elements, one from each of the following groups: (1) similar, different, or opposite; (2) supporting, neutral, or destroying; (3) increasing, constant, or decreasing [...]In Mikrophonie I two percussionists play a large tam-tam with a variety of implements. Another pair of players use hand-held microphones to amplify subtle details and noises, inflecting the sound through quick (and precisely scored) motions. The last two performers, seated in the audience, apply resonant bandpass filters to the microphone outputs and distribute the resulting sounds to a quadraphonic speaker system. The piece was composed on the basis of the results of an experiment carried out by the composer and Jaap Spek in August 1964: I had bought myself a large tamtam for my composition MOMENTE, and set it up in my garden. I now made some experiments, exciting the tamtam with a great variety of implements - of glass, cardboard, metal, wood, rubber, plastic - that I collected from around the house, and connected a microphone (with strong directional sensitivity) that I held in my hand and moved around, to an electrical filter, whose output led to a potentiometer and was then made audible over a loudspeaker. My collaborator Spek was in the house and changed the filter settings and the dynamic levels, improvising. At the same time, we recorded the result on tape. The tape recording of this first <b>microphony</b> experiment was for me a discovery of the greatest importance. We had made no agreement about what the other would do; I used some of the implements that lay to hand as the mood took me, and at the same time I probed the surface of the tamtam with the microphone, as a doctor probes a body with a stethoscope; Spek also reacted spontaneously to what he heard as the result of our combined activity. (preface to the score of Mikrophonie I, p. 9)After an initial attempt to notate the actions and implements proved impractically complicated, Stockhausen decided to categorize the sounds according to their perceived qualities: [...] "groaning, [...] " [...] "trumpeting, [...] " [...] "whirring, [...] " [...] "hooting," [...] "roaring," [...] "grating, [...] " [...] "chattering, [...] " [...] "wailing, [...] " [...] "sawing, [...] " [...] "ringing, [...] " [...] "choking, [...] " [...] "cawing, [...] " [...] "clacking, [...] " [...] "snorting, [...] " [...] "chirping, [...] " [...] "hissing, [...] " [...] "grunting, [...] " [...] "crunching, [...] " [...] "clinking, [...] " [...] "tromboning, [...] " [...] "scraping, [...] " [...] etc., in a scale of 36 steps from the darkest and lowest to the brightest and highest sounds [...] Through this emphasis on subjectively perceived qualities, [...] "For the first time a perceptual equivalent to totally organized structure has been discovered, and it is particularly significant that this has been done with very simple means. This successful fusion of abstract theory and expression makes Mikrophonie I a work of singular importance" [...]“Someone said, must it be a tam-tam? I said no, I can imagine the score being used to examine an old Volkswagen musically, to go inside the old thing and bang it and scratch it and do all sorts of things to it, and play MIKROPHONIE I, using the microphone” [...] However, when it came to tam-tams, some were less suitable than others, and the assortment of implements used to excite the tam-tam in the original performances could be substituted only with difficulty, if the desired range of sounds was to be obtained [...]|$|E
40|$|To {{achieve a}} {{substantial}} reduction of <b>microphony</b> in pyroelectric sensors we are proposing {{to replace the}} homogeneous pyroelectric material by a composite. The pyroelectric coefficients of polyvinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene copolymer (PVDF-TrFE) and perovskites like lead titanate (PT) have the same sign, while their piezoelectric coefficients d 33 and d 31 have opposite signs. When a ferroelectric composite is prepared by dispersing PT particles in a PVDF-TrFE matrix and the inclusions and matrix are polarized in the same direction, their pyroelectric signals reinforce while their piezoelectric signals partially or completely cancel out. Pyroelectric sensors have been fabricated by depositing this composite material on a polyimide membrane.
