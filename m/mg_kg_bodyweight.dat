40|$|The {{influence}} of the time interval between dye administration and detection by fluorescence microscopy was assessed in "early" squamous cell carcinomas of the cheek pouch mucosa and different healthy tissues of the Syrian hamster. Following intracardiac injection of 0. 15 <b>mg</b> (<b>kg</b> <b>bodyweight)</b> - 1 of meso-tetra-hydroxyphenylchlorin (m-THPC), groups of three animals were sacrificed at different time intervals up to 30 days. A group of three non-injected animals was used to detect the endogene fluorescence of the corresponding normal tissues for autofluorescence subtraction. The following excised organs (oesophagus, trachea, liver, spleen, kidney, skin, striated muscle, healthy and tumoral cheek pouch mucosae) were fast frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 70 degrees C for fluorescence microscopy. The results show {{significant differences in the}} detectable m-THPC levels in different tissue layers (for instance, the epithelia and muscle of the oesophagus, trachea and cheek pouch) at different time intervals.

40|$|In {{order to}} define a "no effect level" for glycyrrhizin, a double-blind, {{randomized}} controlled {{study was conducted in}} 39 healthy female volunteers. The volunteers took a daily dosage of either 0, 1, 2 or 4 <b>mg</b> glycyrrhizin per <b>kg</b> <b>bodyweight</b> for a period of 8 weeks. The dosages and the preference for female volunteers were based on a previous pilot study. The following parameters were studied: bodyweight, blood pressure, plasma electrolytes, 24 hour urinary excretion of electrolytes, plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone concentration, plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration and plasma glycyrrhetic acid concentration. The participants kept a journal of complaints and diet. Effects were observed in the highest dosage group only (4 <b>mg</b> glycyrrhizin per <b>kg</b> <b>bodyweight).</b> These concerned volume expansion {{on the one hand and}} changes in plasma electrolyte concentration on the other. Volume expansion during intake of glycyrrhizin was indicated by suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and by weight gain. The changes in electrolyte concentration were a decline in plasma potassium concentration and a rise in plasma bicarbonate concentration during glycyrrhizin intake. Besides, the atrial natriuretic peptide concentration decreased after discontinuation of glycyrrhizin intake. The changes in electrolyte concentration concerned a decline in plasma potassium concentration and a rise in plasma bicarbonate concentration during glycyrrhizin intake. Based on this study, the "no effect level" for glycyrrhizin is concluded to be 2 <b>mg</b> per <b>kg</b> <b>bodyweight...</b>|$|R

40|$|Ultrastructural {{investigations}} in Fasciola hepatica after the therapy with albendazole sulphoxide with Rattus norvegicus and with sheep In {{the course of}} this study several tests were out into whether, and in what concentrations, albendazole sulphoxide is suitable for use in therapy against F. hepatica. It was also determined whether the use of an enhancer results in an improvement of efficacy and allows the reduction of the active substance. The study also investigated the effects of albendazole sulphoxide on the morphology of the parasite. Parasite tissue was analysed using both transmission electron and scanning electron microscopy in order to determine whether morphological changes occurred under exposure to the active substance. In the animal experimental part of the study, it was found that albendazole sulphoxide has a fasciolide effect whether administered orally, subcutaneously or intraperitoneally to rats in a dosage of 30 <b>mg</b> per <b>kg</b> <b>bodyweight.</b> In combination with the enhancer, the quantity of active substance in the aforementioned forms of administration can be reduced to 20 <b>mg</b> per <b>kg</b> <b>bodyweight.</b> For pour- on treatment of the infected rats, a dose of 130 <b>mg</b> per <b>kg</b> <b>bodyweight</b> was found to be necessary if albendazole sulphoxide was applied by itself. In combination with enhancer the albendazole sulphoxide dose for pour- on treatment could be reduced to 90 <b>mg</b> per <b>kg</b> <b>bodyweight.</b> The studies showed that the enhancer itself had no fasziolide effect. It allowed a reduction of the quantity of the active substance required and stoped the secretion of eggs faster. The effective quantity of the active compound in the oral application in sheep was found to be 20 mg albendazole sulphoxide per <b>kg</b> <b>bodyweight.</b> The pour- on dosage determined as being necessary in sheep was 20 mg to be 200 mg albendazole sulphoxide per <b>kg</b> <b>bodyweight</b> in combination with the enhancer. For the electron microscope examinations, rats were treated with 20 mg and 40 mg albendazole sulphoxide per <b>Kg</b> <b>bodyweight.</b> Treatment was given both in the form of albendazole sulphoxide alone and in combination with the enhancer. The worms were examined after 24 and 48 hours. Both scanning and transmission electron microscopy showed that the higher the dose, the more substantial the damage caused to the worm. It was also found that the damage to the parasite increased the longer it was exposed to the active substance. With use of the enhancer, the damage to F. hepatica was greater and more marked than under treatment with albendazole sulphoxide alone. Examination under the scanning electron microscope revealed that the treatment evidently causes marked damage {{to the surface of the}} worm. In all the worms exposed to treatment, swelling of the tegument could be seen, causing the hooks located on top to appear sunken in. Additionally, an accumulation of small blisters and cytoplasmatic debris was observed on the tegument. Under higher dosages and with additional application of the enhancer, furrows occurred in the tegument, with loss of hooks from the worm`s surface. The examinations revealed no differences in reaction between the ventral and the dorsal tegument. However, the damage to the rear end of the worm was more marked than to the front end. With the aid of the TEM images, it was possible to examine the damage caused by albendazole sulphoxide alone and in combination with the enhancer to the tegument, intestine and ovary. In all the tissue examined, treatment with the active substance was found to cause damage in the form of extensive vacuole formation. The most severe damage in all the tissue examined was observed in the area of the basal lamina in the form of merging vacuoles. Use of the enhancer intensified the damage, with additionally fissuring. Mitochondrial changes in morphology such as swelling and bursting occured. In some cases, the basal lamina broke away from the surrounding tissue, creating large cavities in the worm tissue in some cases being completely lysed...|$|R

We used laboratory male albino rats with the initial body weight of 200 - 210 grams. Observation terms included the 3 rd, 10 th, 15 th, 24 th, and 45 th days after {{the administration of the}} preparation was discontinued.   According to X-ray diffraction analysis and the method of internal control administration of tartrazine was accompanied with an increase in the degree of amorphism of the femoral bone biomineral (the decrease in the proportion of hydroxyapatite and increase in the proportions whitlockite and calcite). The intensity of adverse reaction depended on tartrazine dosage. The induction of tibial fracture on the background of previous administration of tartrazine was accompanied with an increase in the degree of amorphism of the bone biomineral. The alterations were recorded throughout the whole observation and were directly dependent on tartrazine dosage. The induction of tibial fracture on the background of previous administration of tartrazine and mexidol (50 <b>mg</b> per <b>kg</b> of <b>bodyweight)</b> was accompanied with a less significant disturbance of the phase composition of the femoral bone biomineral.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The work presented in this thesis {{is concerned with the}} chemotherapy of parasite infestations in the ruminant with the anthelmintic thiophanate [diethyl 4, 4 '-o-phenylene bis (3 -thioallophanate) ]. A new concept of administration was investigated, namely continuous low-level anthelmintic medication. Two aspects were studied which divide conveniently into two sections. In Section 1, following preliminary trials undertaken to assess the low-level anthelmintic activity of thiophanate, the effects are assessed when this drug is administered continually directly into the rumen of parasitised sheep. Thiophanate was infused at dosages between 3. 0 and 5. 0 <b>mg</b> per <b>kg</b> <b>bodyweight</b> over various periods of medication against various developmental stages of gastro-intestinal parasites. The daily drug release rate. required to inhibit egg hatch and eliminate the worm burden is established. A minimum daily release rate of 3. 0 <b>mg</b> per <b>kg</b> <b>bodyweight</b> was shown to be required to completely inhibit egg hatch and 4. 5 <b>mg</b> per <b>kg</b> for effective vermicidal activity. In similar experiments, the anthelmintic activities of levamisole (s-(-) - 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetrahydro- 6 -phenylimidazo (2, 1 -b) thiazole), febantel (N-(2 -(2, 3 -bis-(methoxycarbonyl) -guanidino) - 5 -(phenyl-thio) -phenyl) - 2 -methoxy-acetamide) and briefly oxfendazole (5 -(phenylsulfinyl) -IH-benzimidazol- 2 yl) carbamate) were also examined. In Section 2, the development of an intra-ruminal bolus incorporating thiophanate and designed to release drug at a predetermined rate {{over an extended period of}} time is described. Experiments were carried out in sheep to assess the bolus density required for retention within the reticulo-rumen (monitored by direct bolus recovery), to compare various density factors (iron powder, iron bar core, iron shot and sand) and to assess the average drug release rate from different matrix formulations (based on fatty acids, palmitic acid and paraffin wax) when the boluses were dosed singly or in pairs. The development of a stable "carrier" on which to load a suitable matrix is also described, the majority of the experiments undertaken utilising this "carrier". The effect on the drug release rate of incorporating various "leaching aids" (digestible materials, wetting and soluble agents) into the matrix is examined and preliminary anthelmintic trials undertaken in experimentally infected lambs. The required drug release is achieved when the boluses are administered in pairs. The anthelmintic activity is confirmed. Possible matrices suitable for use as a single bolus administration were produced. The advantages of this form of anthelmintic medication over the single therapeutic dose are discussed along with some indications for further studies that emerged. May and Baker Limite...|$|R

40|$|Leukocyte extravasation is {{a finely}} tuned process, in which transmigration {{is the final}} step. Transmigration depends on {{molecules}} located at borders of endothelial cells; e. g., junctional adhesion molecules (JAM-A, -B and -C). In vivo blockade of JAM-A lead to decreased migration of monocytes into the skin. In contrast, the role of JAM-B and -C in development of cutaneous inflammation is unknown. We therefore elicited an allergic contact dermatitis in mice using 2, 4 -dinitro- 1 -fluorobenzene. RT-PCR and immunofluorescent staining of healthy skin revealed a constitutive JAM-B (66. 4 %+/- 6. 7 % of all vessels) and -C expression (88. 6 +/- 13. 2 %), which remained constant after induction of contact dermatitis. Functional studies, in which either JAM-B or -C neutralizing antibodies were injected into sensitized mice prior to allergen challenge showed a concentration-dependent reduction of the contact dermatitis. Decreased ear swelling was accompanied by reduction of leukocyte infiltration as analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) histology and enzyme activity. Combined antibody treatment at doses of 1. 25 <b>mg</b> per <b>kg</b> <b>bodyweight</b> lead to additive inhibition of allergic contact dermatitis, indicating that JAM-B and -C may have distinct functions.

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the effectiveness of Statofilm, a novel antiadhesive film based on cross-linked carboxymethylcellulose and atorvastatin, with that of sodium hyaluronate-carboxymethylcellulose (Seprafilm®) in the prevention of postoperative intraperitoneal adhesions in rats. Methods: One hundred male Wistar rats underwent a laparotomy and adhesions were induced by caecal abrasion. The animals were allocated to five groups: a control group with no adhesion barrier, Seprafilm® group, placebo group with a film containing carboxymethylcellulose without atorvastatin, and low- and high-dose groups with films containing carboxymethylcellulose and atorvastatin 0 · 125 and 1 <b>mg</b> per <b>kg</b> <b>bodyweight</b> respectively. Adhesions were classified by two independent surgeons 2 weeks after surgery. Caecal biopsies were obtained for histological evaluation of fibrosis, inflammation and vascular proliferation. Results: All antiadhesive film groups (Seprafilm®, placebo, low-dose and high-dose) had statistically significant adhesion reduction compared with the control group (P < 0 · 001, P = 0 · 015, P < 0 · 001 and P < 0 · 001 respectively). The low-dose Statofilm was superior to Seprafilm® in terms of adhesion prevention (P = 0 · 001). Adhesions were present in three-quarters of rats in the Seprafilm® group, but only one-quarter in the low-dose Statofilm group. Conclusion: The data suggest that the newly developed adhesion barrier Statofilm has better results than Seprafilm® in preventing postoperative adhesions in rats. A low-dose atorvastatin-containing film, such as Statofilm, could be evaluated for future clinical application. Copyright © 2012 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd.

40|$|Leptospirosis is a re-emerging {{infectious}} disease with zoonotic potential. Pigs are reservoir hosts of the pathogen and streptomycin {{is among the}} antibiotics proposed to eliminate leptospiral infection. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine streptomycin concentrations and the possible effect of the presence of Leptospira in the liver and kidneys on drug distribution. Six pigs with leptospirosis and six age, gender and breed matched healthy pigs were intramuscularly administered streptomycin at a dose of 10 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 <b>bodyweight</b> once daily for four consecutive days. Prior to administration biochemistry was employed to evaluate liver and kidney function. All pigs were euthanized and the concentrations of streptomycin in their liver and kidney were determined employing an HPLC-MC method. Infected pigs showed hyperbilirubinaemia and an increase in alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase activities compared with uninfected controls. Urine specific gravity was reduced in infected pigs, however, without elevated levels of urea and creatinine. A higher mean concentration in both organs-statistically significant only for liver-of healthy pigs was observed. The decreased concentrations of streptomycin in infected pigs could be at least partially attributed to the hepatic and renal damage caused by leptospirae and in turn the possible reduced efficacy of streptomycin to its reduced concentrations at the main sites of infection. Possible alterations of drug concentrations by liver and/or kidney infection by various pathogens including Leptospira should be taken into consideration when determining doses to result in effective drug concentrations at the site of infection...|$|R
40|$|Feral {{monk parakeet}} (Myiopsitta monachus) populations have become {{established}} in the United States and other countries around the world, and can cause damage to electrical facilities. Because the monk parakeet is a highly visible species and there is often public opposition to lethal control measures, non-lethal methods, such as contraception, are being developed to help control the spread of feral populations. Two gavage studies and one ad libitum nesting study were conducted to assess the efficacy of DiazaCon™ as a potential contraceptive for the monk parakeet. The first gavage study compared daily dose levels of 0, 50, 75, and 100 <b>mg</b> DiazaCon™ (<b>kg</b> <b>bodyweight)</b> – 1 administered for 10 consecutive days. Cholesterol concentrations decreased significantly concomitant with {{a significant increase in}} desmosterol concentrations in the treated groups, but did not vary between sexes. Cholesterol and desmosterol concentrations did not differ significantly among DiazaCon™ groups, and cholesterol remained significantly suppressed 12 weeks after treatment. On the basis of these results, the second gavage study compared 5 or 10 consecutive days of DiazaCon™ administration at 50 mg kg– 1 bird– 1 day– 1. Cholesterol concentrations decreased significantly concomitant with a significant increase in desmosterol concentrations in the treated groups, but did not vary between sexes. Cholesterol and desmosterol concentrations did not differ significantly between DiazaCon™ groups, and cholesterol remained significantly suppressed 11 weeks after treatment. Parakeets in the nesting study were fed hulled sunflower seeds treated with a target dose of 50 mg DiazaCon™ kg– 1 bird– 1 day– 1. Birds consumed enough to receive an average dose of 34 mg kg– 1 pair– 1 day– 1, or 17 mg kg– 1 bird– 1 day– 1. Birds in the treated group laid an average of 1. 6 ± 0. 7 eggs per clutch compared with 3. 9 ± 1. 1 eggs per clutch in the untreated control group. None of the eggs laid by treated birds hatched compared with 1. 1 ± 0. 6 eggs per clutch hatching in the control group. Reproductive inhibition was effective for the length of the breeding season, at which time the study was stopped and no more data were collected. DiazaCon™ is a promising avian oral contraceptive that should be further investigated in a field setting with monk parakeets...|$|R
40|$|The {{accumulation}} of As, Cd, Cr, Pb and Zn in soils {{and vegetables in}} the vicinity of Enyigba Lead mine were investigated using Particle Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) spectrometry. Samples from Abakaliki served as control. The five edible vegetables studied include Telfaria occidentalis (fluted pumpkin); Talinum triangulare (water leaf); Amaranthus hybridus (Amaranth or pigweed); Vernonia amygdalina (bitter leaf); and Solmun nigrum (garden egg leaf). The metal concentrations in the soil decreased with depth which possibly suggests anthropogenic sources of contamination. The levels of Pb > Ni > Cd in Enyigba top soil was observed to be above the US-EPA Regulatory Limits in that order. Elevated concentrations of heavy metals were recorded in all the vegetable samples from Enyigba Lead mine and they exceeded those of Abakaliki. The results revealed that heavy metal values in the vegetable from Enyigba ranged from 0. 035 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 - 0. 400 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 (As), 0. 001 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 - 0. 01 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 (Cd), 0. 023 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 - 0. 273 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 (Cr), 0. 105 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 - 0. 826 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 (Pb), and 0. 016 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 - 0. 174 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 (Zn); while those from Abakaliki were found to be 0. 022 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 - 0. 280 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 (As), 0. 002 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 - 0. 009 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 (Cd), 0. 023 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 - 0. 210 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 (Cr), 0. 091 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 - 0. 426 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - (Pb) and 0. 022 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 - 0. 144 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> - 1 (Zn).

Forty-five minutes after lateral recumbency, deer were given appropriate antagonist drugs (half i. v., half i. m.). All drug combinations except the XK dose produced lateral recumbency in the deer. Hyperthermia occurred in the XK, MKB and MK groups. The MKT-A and MKT-B treatments resulted in acceptable physiological parameters, rapid induction and quick recovery. Combining ketamine (for a relatively shorter recovery time), tiletamine-zolazepam (for rapid induction) and medetomidine (for synergistic effects and increased relaxation) may optimize induction and recovery times in white-tailed deer...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{concentrations}} of arsenic and heavy metals in agricultural soils {{are becoming a}} growing problem in industrialized countries. These harmful elements represent {{the basis of a}} range of problems in the food chain, and are a potential hazard for animal and human health. It is therefore important to gauge their absolute and relative concentrations in soils that are used for crop production. In this study the arsenic and heavy metal concentrations in 274 mineral soil samples and 38 organogenic soil samples taken from South Savo province in 2000 were determined using the aqua regia extraction technique. The soil samples were collected from 23 farms. The elements analyzed were arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, mercury, nickel, lead and zinc. The median concentrations in the mineral soils were:As 2. 90 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> – 1, Cd 0. 084 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> – 1, Cr 17. 0 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> – 1, Cu 13. 0 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> – 1, Hg 0. 060 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> – 1, Ni 5. 4 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> – 1, Pb 7. 7 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> – 1, Zn 36. 5 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> – 1. The corresponding values in the organogenic soils were:As 2. 80 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> – 1, Cd 0. 265 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> – 1, Cr 15. 0 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> – 1, Cu 29. 0 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> – 1, Hg 0. 200 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> – 1, Ni 5. 9 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> – 1, Pb 11. 0 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> – 1, Zn 25. 5 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> – 1. The results indicated that cadmium and mercury concentrations in the mineral and organogenic soils differed. Some of the arsenic, cadmium and mercury concentrations exceeded the normative values but did not exceed limit values. Most of the agricultural fields in South Savo province contained only small amounts of arsenic and heavy metals and could be classified as “Clean Soil”.

40|$|The {{disposition}} of many drugs in cystic fibrosis is abnormal compared with healthy individuals. In general, changes include an increased volume of distribution expressed in liters per <b>kg</b> <b>bodyweight</b> for highly hydrophilic {{drugs such as}} aminoglycosides, and, to a lesser extent, for penicillins and cephalosporins, together with an increased total body clearance. The main reason for the increased volume of distribution is the increased amount of lean tissue per <b>kg</b> <b>bodyweight,</b> since patients with CF are generally undernourished and have a paucity of adipose tissue. The reason for the increased renal clearance is less clear. Increased glomerular filtration and tubular secretion have been observed. Protein binding generally is unaltered in CF. The fluorquinolones and vancomycin show no altered pharmacokinetics in CF although gastro-intestinal absorption may be delayed for fluorquinolones. Sulphamethoxazole shows increased clearance due to an increased acetylation and, {{in the case of}} trimethoprim, renal clearance is increased compared with healthy individuals. As a consequence, drugs that show increased clearance, will lead to reduced serum concentrations and smaller AUCs and therefore CF patients require larger doses per <b>kg</b> <b>bodyweight...</b>|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{reports the}} {{clinical}} findings in myiosis in 33 sheep and in 11 {{dogs in the}} flocks of the affected sheep. Moreover, it presents a protocol for treatment of genital myiosis. Location of lesions in affected sheep was as follows: in 16 animals (9 rams, 7 ewes) at the genitalia, in 6 animals {{in one of their}} ear canals, in 5 animals at the hoofs in one of their legs, in 3 animals on the back, in 3 animals on the neck In the genitalia of rams, findings were difficult or partial exteriorising of penis, markedly thickened prepuce with fistulae along the tissue and presence of dipteran larvae in the subcutaneous tissue. In the genitalia of ewes, findings included vulvar oedema, hyperaemia and/or petechiae in the vaginal wall, muco-haemorrhagic discharge, 2 - 3 subcutaneous fistulae around the vulva and presence of dipteran larvae in the vagina or in the subcutaneous fistulae around the vulva. Location of lesions in affected dogs was as follows: in 6 animals on the neck, in 5 animals in one of their legs and in 1 animal in the tail. Larvae were collected and identified by using classical parasitological techniques; in 32 sheep cases and in all (11) dog cases, they were identified as Wohlfahrtia magnifica larvae, whilst in one sheep case they were identified as Lucilia sericata larvae (this being the first recovery of Lucilia sp. from myiosis in Greece). In cases of genital myiosis, treatment included, initially, mechanical removal of the larvae by using medical forceps whilst massaging the affected area; this was followed by thorough cleansing of the area with 2 % chlorhexidine solution (1 : 40 in water); subsequently, moxidectin 1 % inj. sol. (0. 3 <b>mg</b> per <b>kg</b> <b>bodyweight)</b> and flunixin meglumine in sol. (2. 2 mg/kg bodyweight) were administered. The procedure was repeated 8 - 10 days later. Ewes with genital infestation were also prescribed a 7 -day long course of an injectable broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent. In all cases, all larvae were successfully removed with the above treatment. However, in 5 animals (3 rams, 2 ewes), lesions, which had developed before start of treatment, were so extensive that it was considered that they would cause difficulties in subsequent matings or lambings; hence, it was advised to cull these animals.
