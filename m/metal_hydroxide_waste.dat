The integrity tests on the fabricated solidification should also meet the criteria of the Korea Radioactive Waste Agency. We carried out the solidification of <b>metal</b> <b>hydroxide</b> <b>waste</b> using cement solidification. The integrity tests such as the compressive strength, immersion, leach, and irradiation tests on the fabricated cement solidifications were performed. It was also confirmed that these requirements of the criteria of Korea Radioactive Waste Agency on these cement solidifications were met. The microstructures of all the cement solidifications were analyzed and discussed...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} {{we report on the}} {{production}} of metal-hydroxide-coated macroporous polymers (MHCMPs), which mainly involves a polyacrylamide backbone coated with iron-aluminium double hydroxides. The coating process is fast, occurs using relatively mild reagents at room temperature, and can be repeated multiple times, thus making it a very simple and flexible process. Electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy studies showed that <b>metal</b> <b>hydroxide</b> coating occurred throughout the polymer backbone. It was shown that the mass of <b>metal</b> <b>hydroxides</b> incorporated in the MHCMPs could be adjusted by varying the initial salt solution concentration or the number of cycles in the process. Under the studied conditions, on a polymer backbone of mass 25 mg, we observed a maximum <b>metal</b> <b>hydroxide</b> mass incorporation of 18 mg for the MHCMPs produced at 6 cycles by using 0. 4 M iron and aluminium salt solution. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms indicated that the surface area of the MHCMPs increased linearly with the increase in the mass of <b>metal</b> <b>hydroxides</b> incorporated. The polymer backbone with no mass incorporated showed a BET surface area of 18 m(2) g(- 1) and the MHCMPs with maximum mass incorporation under the studied conditions showed a BET surface area of 63 m(2) g(- 1). MHCMPs with varying mass incorporations were applied for arsenic (As(III)) adsorption and showed a high As(III) removal, indicating that they can serve as potential adsorbents. In addition, MHCMPs incorporated with other <b>metal</b> <b>hydroxides</b> were also produced and characterized to show that this method is applicable for coating these as well...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{studied the}} influence of individual heavy metal on the hydration reactions of major cement clinker phases in order to investigate the performance of cement based stabilization/solidification (S/S) system. Tricalcium silicate (C 3 S) and tricalcium aluminate (C 3 A) had been mixed with individual heavy <b>metal</b> <b>hydroxide</b> including Zn(OH) 2, Pb(OH) 2 and Cu(OH) 2, respectively. The influences of these heavy <b>metal</b> <b>hydroxides</b> on the hydration of C 3 S and C 3 A have been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry-thermogravimetry (DSC-TG). A mixture of Zn(OH) 2, Pb(OH) 2 and Cu(OH) 2 was blended with Portland cement (PC) and evaluated through compressive strength and dynamic leach test. XRD and DSC-TG data show that all the heavy <b>metal</b> <b>hydroxides</b> (Zn(OH) 2, Pb(OH) 2 and Cu(OH) 2) have {{detrimental effects on the}} hydration of C 3 A, but only Zn(OH) 2 does to the C 3 S at early curing ages which can completely inhibit the hydration of C 3 S due to the formation of CaO(Zn(OH) 2) · 2 H 2 O.

Three alkali <b>metal</b> <b>hydroxides</b> (LiOH, NaOH and KOH) and three alkaline earth <b>metals</b> <b>hydroxides</b> (Ca(OH) (2), Ba(OH) (2), Sr(OH) (2)) were used.

This thesis shows that hydroxide sludge is fully possible to recycle back into the AOD converter during slag reduction stage. Its calcium fluoride contents are utilized as flux. Prior to reintroduction, the hydroxide sludge is dried and calcined to drive off all water, included chemically bonded water. Calcined <b>metal</b> <b>hydroxide</b> sludge is called hydroflux. Metal content in hydroflux is present as metal oxides. In a bench-scale AOD converter seven successful reduction tests, with three different varieties of hydrofluxes, type A, B and C were performed. The reduction tests are conducted with same basicity and CaO/CaF 2 ratio as a full scale AOD converter. Chemical analysis and X-ray diffraction analysis show that near identical final slag chemistry is achieved as planned. Some differences in metal retrieval, depending on hydroflux type used, are noticed. Briquetting as agglomeration method is performed on one hydroflux. Three types of strength tests are performed on the hydrofluxes and results are compared to toughness of mineral fluorspar. Theoretical calculation results show how final slag as well as additives will increase with use of hydroflux as calcium fluoride provider in the AOD converter during reduction procedure. The pros and cons for every hydroflux are weighed against each other and one type of hydroflux is recommended for further full-scale usage. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
