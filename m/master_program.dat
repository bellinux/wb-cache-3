5|$|While {{the five}} women worked on ENIAC, they {{developed}} subroutines, nesting, and other fundamental programming techniques, and arguably invented {{the discipline of}} programming digital computers. Bartik's programming partner on the ENIAC was Betty Holberton. Together, they created the <b>master</b> <b>program</b> for the ENIAC and led the ballistics programming group. The team also learned to physically modify the machine, moving switches and rerouting cables, in order to program it. In addition to performing the original ballistic trajectories they were hired to compute, they soon became operators on the Los Alamos nuclear calculations, and generally expanded the programming repertoire of the machine. Bartik was chosen along with Betty Holberton to write a program to display trajectory simulations for the first public demonstration of the ENIAC.|$|E

40|$|We {{assess the}} {{predictors}} {{of the likelihood}} that a student will graduate from the <b>master’s</b> <b>program</b> of a business university. We use data from three years of a <b>master’s</b> <b>program,</b> totaling 455 students. The methods used are bivariate tests and logistic regression analysis. We find that the likelihood of a student graduating from the <b>master’s</b> <b>program</b> is positively related to the student i) holding their previous degree from business, as opposed to another field, ii) moving from another country to take the <b>master’s</b> <b>program,</b> and iii) taking up a <b>master’s</b> <b>program</b> with a qualitative, rather than quantitative, orientation. Interestingly, we find no evidence to suggest that whether a student’s previous degree is from a research university or from a practically oriented polytechnic would be related to the student’s odds of graduating. The results are relevant for <b>master’s</b> <b>program</b> teachers who can benefit from taking into account their students’ varying backgrounds, and for people responsible for planning theselection criteria and implementation of <b>master’s</b> <b>programs.</b> The results are also encouraging for polytechnic students who are contemplating taking further studies at a research university.
