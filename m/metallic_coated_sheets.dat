40|$|A {{study of}} Abrasive Waterjet (AWJ) cutting of <b>metallic</b> <b>coated</b> <b>sheet</b> steels is {{presented}} {{based on a}} statistically designed experiment. It shows that AWJ cutting is a viable technology for processing <b>metallic</b> <b>coated</b> <b>sheet</b> steels with good productivity and kerf quality. A scanning electron microscopy analysis indicates that micromachining and plastic deformation are the dominant cutting phenomena in sheet steel processing. Plausible trends and relationships between kerf characteristics and process parameters are discussed. It is found that an optimum water pressure together with small standoff distance between the nozzle and workpiece may be used, while the traverse speed should be selected as high as possible for through cuts {{in order to increase}} the cutting rate. Empirical models for kerf geometry and quality are finally established for the prediction and optimization of AWJ cutting performance...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation is}} presented which analyses the CO 2 {{laser cutting process}} for difficult-to-cut <b>metallic</b> <b>coated</b> <b>sheet</b> steels, GALVABOND. It shows that by proper control of the cutting parameters, good quality cuts are possible at high cutting rate. Plausible trends of the energy efficiency (percentage of energy used in cutting) {{with respect to the}} various process parameters are analysed. Visual examination indicates that when increasing the cutting rate to as high as 5000 mm/min, kerfs of better quality than those produced using the parameters suggested in an early study can be achieved. Some kerf characteristics such as the width, heat affected zone and dross in terms of the process parameters are also discussed. A statistical analysis has arrived at the relationships between the cutting speed, laser power and workpiece thickness, from which a recommendation is made on the selection of optimum cutting parameters for processing GALVABOND...|$|R
40|$|The {{resistance}} spot weldability characteristics of three commercially available electrode compositions, Cu/Cr, Cu/Cr/Zr, and Cu/Zr {{have been investigated}} when welding three <b>metallic</b> <b>coated</b> <b>sheet</b> steels: aluminium 45 % zinc, galvanised and galvanneal steels. Electrodes were evaluated using weldability lobes and electrode life tests. The aggressive nature of the erosion process encountered for Al- 45 %Zn and galvanised steels masks the influence of small additions of alloying elements such as Zr on electrode life. However, for galvanneal steel where the erosion process is more gradual, the Cu/Cr/Zr electrode {{proved to be the}} most effective in obtaining maximum life. The development and composition of alloy layers which form on the tips of each electrode used to weld galvanneal steel have been identified from the outside as: a surface oxide sublayer (ZnO), a porous Fe-Zn sublayer (F phase: FesZnio), a hard and brittle gamma (y) brass (CusZng) sublayer, and a ductile beta (p) brass (CuZn) sublayer, and then the Cu/Cr substrate. The feasibility of depositing a surface coating onto Cu/Cr electrodes to mitigate the formation of alloy layers and thus extend electrode life was also investigated. Physical vapour deposition of Cr using unbalanced magnetron sputtering and filtered arc evaporation extended the life of Cu/Cr electrodes by 100 % from approximately 420 to 840 welds when welding Al- 45 %Zn sheet steel. Although extension of electrode tip life was achieved it has been established that the life determining failure mechanism of coated electrodes is by gross plastic deformation of the electrode tip due to the extreme temperatures and repeated compressive forces generated during the welding operation. It is therefore proposed that future work should aim to improve the mechanical properties of the electrode material in order to provide a strong base capable of supporting a thin liquid metal resistant coating. This is essential {{to take full advantage of}} the benefits that thin film coatings have to offer...|$|R
40|$|The {{information}} {{derived from}} impedance diagrams obtained by using electrochemical sensors {{specifically designed for}} lap joints testing of <b>coated</b> <b>metallic</b> <b>sheets</b> is analyzed. The electrochemical sensors were made by means of steel or zinc sheets, uncontaminated or contaminated with variable amounts of sodium chloride, and overcoated with organic coatings. Such sensors show {{the effect of the}} nature of the metallic substrate, the underfilm saline contamination, and the relative humidity of the environment outside the lap joint. The results show that the information obtained from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) on the behavior within the lap joints can be assessed by the criteria traditionally used for plain painted metal surfaces. By modeling the data, it is possible to discriminate between effects due to the organic coating and to the corrosion reaction at the metal-coating interface. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|<b>Metallic</b> <b>coated</b> steel <b>sheet</b> {{can be very}} {{aggressive}} towards copper alloy, resistance spot welding electrodes. These steels accelerate the electrode degradation process far in excess of that experienced when spot welding uncoated steels through an accumulation of the coating around the electrode tips, changing the geometry of the electrode and through an erosion process on the tip face {{in contact with the}} workpiece. The rate of electrode degradation is closely linked to the chemistry of the <b>metallic</b> <b>coating</b> and can be very severe, particularly when welding steels with coatings high in aluminium or when inappropriate welding conditions are used. High volume welding industries employing these steels are n o w faced with the need to more frequently monitor weld quality and electrode condition in order to sustain structural integrity of their product. Being very time consuming, the traditional shop floor, destructive techniques for assessing weld quality, are no longer considered appropriate. This has provided the impetus for researchers to develop new, non-destructive techniques which are easily implemented and which remove operator judgement as to the condition of electrodes. This work examines the feasibility of such a technique. The Adept (Advanced Grey Scale) Vision System has been assessed as to its ability to view and accurately measure the impression left by spot welding electrodes on the surface of a zinc-iron rich <b>metallic</b> <b>coated</b> steel during a simulated production run and to equate these measurements to weld nugget size and tensile shear strength. The results of this work appear promising in that the vision system has identified electrode wear patterns and has successfully related these to both nugget size and tensile shear strength, these being paramount to engineers charged with design. The accuracy of the vision system has been thoroughly checked through the use of other techniques including carbon paper impression measurements of the degrading tips, profilometry on the impression left by the indenting electrode and ultrasonic and X-ray measurement of the weld prior to final destructive peel testing to measure actual weld nugget size. All techniques indicate trends that support the vision systems future capability as a new, non-destructive weld quality monitoring system...|$|R
