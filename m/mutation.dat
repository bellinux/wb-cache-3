Recent careful reexamination of γ-secretase activity indicates that some PS <b>mutations</b> decrease the proteolytic activity of γ-secretase, suggesting a loss-of-function nature of PS <b>mutations.</b> To extend this observation to all known PS <b>mutations,</b> a large number of PS <b>mutations</b> were evaluated using bioinformatic tools.

5|$|But {{not all the}} SNPs have a {{detrimental}} effect on TG levels.

5|$|In {{addition}} to being a major source of variation, <b>mutation</b> may also function as a mechanism of evolution when there are different probabilities at the molecular level for different mutations to occur, a process known as <b>mutation</b> bias. If two genotypes, for example one with the nucleotide G and another with the nucleotide A in the same position, have the same fitness, but <b>mutation</b> from G to A happens more often than <b>mutation</b> from A to G, then genotypes with A will tend to evolve. Different insertion vs. deletion <b>mutation</b> biases in different taxa can lead to the evolution of different genome sizes. Developmental or mutational biases have also been observed in morphological evolution. For example, according to the phenotype-first theory of evolution, mutations can eventually cause the genetic assimilation of traits that were previously induced by the environment.|$|E

We searched for <b>mutations</b> in the entire coding exons, including splice sites of the gene, in Korean patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). <b>Mutations</b> of the gene were determined by direct sequencing in 176 NSCLCs. Sixty-nine <b>mutations</b> (62 different <b>mutations)</b> were identified in 65 tumors.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to DNA damage, a <b>mutation</b> {{is a change}} in the base sequence of the DNA. A <b>mutation</b> cannot be recognized by enzymes once the base change is present in both DNA strands, and thus a <b>mutation</b> cannot be repaired. At the cellular level, mutations can cause alterations in protein function and regulation. Mutations are replicated when the cell replicates.

5|$|In natural populations, {{genetic drift}} and natural {{selection}} {{do not act}} in isolation; both forces are always at play, together with <b>mutation</b> and migration. Neutral evolution {{is the product of}} both <b>mutation</b> and drift, not of drift alone. Similarly, even when selection overwhelms genetic drift, it can only act on variation that <b>mutation</b> provides.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mutation</b> bias {{effects are}} {{superimposed}} on other processes. If selection would favor either {{one out of}} two mutations, {{but there is no}} extra advantage to having both, then the <b>mutation</b> that occurs the most frequently is the one that is most likely to become fixed in a population. Mutations leading to the loss of function of a gene are much more common than mutations that produce a new, fully functional gene. Most loss of function mutations are selected against. But when selection is weak, <b>mutation</b> bias towards loss of function can affect evolution. For example, pigments are no longer useful when animals live in the darkness of caves, and tend to be lost. This kind of loss of function can occur because of <b>mutation</b> bias, and/or because the function had a cost, and once the benefit of the function disappeared, natural selection leads to the loss. Loss of sporulation ability in Bacillus subtilis during laboratory evolution appears to have been caused by <b>mutation</b> bias, rather than natural selection against the cost of maintaining sporulation ability. When there is no selection for loss of function, the speed at which loss evolves depends more on the <b>mutation</b> rate than it does on the effective population size, indicating that it is driven more by <b>mutation</b> bias than by genetic drift. In parasitic organisms, <b>mutation</b> bias leads to selection pressures as seen in Ehrlichia. Mutations are biased towards antigenic variants in outer-membrane proteins.|$|E
