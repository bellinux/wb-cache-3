500|$|The song {{has been}} used to {{perpetuate}} the myth of Johnson selling his soul to the Devil for his musical ability. [...] The lyrics do not contain any references to Satan or a Faustian bargain, but they have been interpreted as a description of the singer's fear of losing his soul to the Devil (presumably in exchange for his talent). [...] Music historian Elijah Wald believes that Johnson's verses do not support the idea. [...] Delta bluesman Tommy Johnson promoted himself as having made a deal with the Devil and Southern folklore identifies a crossroads or graveyard as the site of such a pact, which Wald identifies as likely sources of the myth. [...] However, musicologist Robert Palmer points out that Johnson was [...] "fascinated with and probably obsessed by supernatural imagery." [...] His song [...] "Hellhound on My Trail" [...] tells of trying to stay ahead of the demon hound which is pursuing him and in [...] "Me and the Devil Blues" [...] he sings, [...] "Early this mornin' when you knocked upon <b>my</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> I said 'Hello Satan I believe it's time to go'". [...] These songs contribute to the Faustian myth; how much Johnson promoted the idea is debated, although many agree [...] "the 'devil angle' made for good marketing".|$|E

25|$|I {{find a man}} prowling {{about my}} house with {{obviously}} felonious purposes. I hasten to get locks and bars, and to barricade my windows.

60|$|On Monday night I closed <b>my</b> <b>door,</b> <b>And</b> {{thought you}} were not as heretofore, And little cared if we met no more.|$|E
60|$|Very soon I heard talking {{outside of}} <b>my</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> as both my entertainers had clear, high voices, I could hear {{distinctly}} what they said.|$|E
60|$|They halted at <b>my</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> {{there was}} a firm, {{deliberate}} knock. Before I could reply, the handle was turned, and a figure stood upon the threshold.|$|E
6000|$|RANKIN. You have broat onnly trouble <b>and</b> {{expense to}} <b>my</b> <b>door,</b> Hassan; <b>and</b> you know it. Have I ever charged {{your wife and}} {{children}} for my medicines? ...|$|R
6000|$|Suddenly {{the stillness}} was {{disturbed}} by a faint tap at <b>my</b> <b>door.</b> <b>My</b> instincts <b>and</b> my reason {{told me it}} must be Mariani at last. In an instant I had leapt {{from the bed and}} whispered through the keyhole: ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was through}} the {{testimony}} of this man that the motive for the attempted robbery of my house was found out. It had no connection whatever with the other burglaries of our neighbourhood, those, probably, having been committed by low-class thieves, who had not broken into my house simply because <b>my</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> windows had been so well secured; nor had our boy, George William, any share whatever in {{the protection of the}} household.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ou ay, you can sail by <b>my</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> gang to Easie's, but I'm {{thinking}} you would stop at mine too if I had a brass handle on't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Who are you who dare {{to knock}} at <b>my</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> wake me?' cried she. 'Be quick {{and tell me}} what you want, or it will be the worse for you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tom wasn't at home, yet, so I {{gave him}} up; but I {{stumbled}} {{on him and}} Huck right at <b>my</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> so I just brought them along in a hurry." ...|$|E

60|$|There was a rapping at <b>my</b> chamber <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> when I went to open, I {{found the}} Vicomte on the threshold, nightcapped, in his shirt, and bearing a lighted taper.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Well, {{it is of}} {{no great}} consequence, at any rate.' She smiled back at me, closed <b>my</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> {{a few moments later}} I heard her key turn in the lock." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who are ye that disturb honest folk at {{this time}} of night? My house is closed. 'Tis too late for {{profitable}} travellers to be abroad. Cease knocking at <b>my</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> be off." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the middle}} of it all I fell asleep, to be wakened by the officious {{knocking}} at <b>my</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> I find myself twelve years older than I had dreamed myself all night.|$|E
60|$|I {{saw that}} the devoted {{daughter}} was happiest performing alone the last few duties that after death grow measurelessly sweet, and said no more. A few hours later the Doña Maria stood at <b>my</b> <b>door</b> quiet <b>and</b> tearless.|$|R

60|$|I am {{wondering}} whether I should confess or brazen it out, when I hear my sister going hurriedly upstairs. I have a presentiment {{that she has}} gone to talk about me, and I basely open <b>my</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> listen.|$|E
60|$|A {{lamp and}} matches {{stood in the}} hall, and {{lighting}} the lamp, I whisked up stairs with suspicious rapidity, locked <b>my</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> retired to bed, firmly refusing to own even to myself that I had ever heard the name of Bezee Tucker.|$|E
60|$|At last, however, I {{found myself}} at <b>my</b> own <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> in one moment {{satisfied}} myself {{that my brother}} was living, and better. My mother was in the salon, in conversation with M. de Poligny, who had the good judgment to withdraw.|$|R
6000|$|I {{am glad to}} {{look out}} of <b>my</b> back <b>door</b> <b>and</b> see the boys {{smoothing}} {{the foundations of the}} new house; this is all very jolly, but six months of it has satisfied me; we have too many things for such close quarters; to work {{in the midst of all}} the myriad misfortunes of the planter's life, seated in a Dyonisius' (can't spell him) ear, whence I catch every complaint, mishap and contention, is besides the devil; and the hope of a cave of my own inspires me with lust.

60|$|An hour perhaps went by, and I {{had made}} some {{progress}} with my memoir, when <b>my</b> <b>door</b> was opened <b>and</b> the cheery voice of Castelroux greeted me from the threshold.|$|R
6000|$|In a {{short time}} {{there was a knock at}} <b>my</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> the little man handed me in a pair of yellow {{corduroy}} trousers and a large and gaudy dressing-gown. [...] "There!" [...] said he. [...] "They'll keep you warm until your own clothes dry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Very good. I shall {{call you}} {{myself in the}} morning.' He closed <b>my</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> the echo of his steps seemed hardly to have died from my ears before I had sunk into that deep and dreamless sleep which only youth and fatigue can give.|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye!" [...] she rejoined firmly, [...] "the Cæsar, my kinsman! Were he not that, I {{would have}} rushed to <b>my</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> {{called to the}} people, and would have handed over unto them that miserable bundle of rags which stood for the majesty of Cæsar!" ...|$|E
5000|$|After the Russian-language {{publication}} of the book Shusha, Shushinski wrote: [...] "Back then, because of the hostile attitude of Armenians towards me, I was unable to travel to Shusha for three years. Everywhere on the streets stones were thrown at me. I had <b>my</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> windows broken and the telephone wire repeatedly cut. I experienced several assassination attempts. Azerbaijanis who at that time lived in Zangibasar Raion of Armenia ..., wrote me a letter, warning that [...] "a reward of 6 million rubles (now about $6 million) was announced for my head". The book Shusha also created a backlash in the Communist Party of Azerbaijan where Shushinski was labelled as [...] "a bourgeois nationalist".|$|R
6000|$|... "You are an aristo, citizen," [...] she said, gazing with well-feigned admiration {{on the two}} sleuth-hounds {{who stood}} in wait in the anteroom; [...] "it makes me proud {{to see so many}} {{citizens}} at <b>my</b> <b>door.</b> Come <b>and</b> see me play Camille--come to-night, and don't forget the green-room door--it will always be kept invitingly open for you." ...|$|R
60|$|When we {{had retired}} for the night, and Ada and I had had our usual talk in our pretty room, I went out at <b>my</b> <b>door</b> again <b>and</b> sought <b>my</b> {{guardian}} among his books.
