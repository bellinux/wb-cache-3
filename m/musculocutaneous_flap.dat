40|$|Introduction. While {{studies using}} various {{materials}} to overcome ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury {{are becoming increasingly}} common, studies {{on the effects of}} botulinum toxin A (BoTA) on IR injury in musculocutaneous flaps are still limited. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine our hypotheses that BoTA provide protection of <b>musculocutaneous</b> <b>flap</b> from ischemia-reperfusion injury. Method. Five days after pretreatment injection (BoTA versus normal saline), a right superior <b>musculocutaneous</b> <b>flap</b> (6 × 1. 5 [*]cm in size) was made. Ischemia was created by a tourniquet strictly wrapping the pedicle containing skin and muscle for 8 h. After ischemia, the tourniquet was cut, and the <b>musculocutaneous</b> <b>flap</b> was reperfused. Results. The overall survival percentage of flap after 8 [*]h of pedicle clamping followed by reperfusion was 87. 32 ± 3. 67 % in the control group versus 95. 64 ± 3. 25 % in the BoTA group (p< 0. 001). The BoTA group had higher expression of CD 34, HIF- 1 α, VEGF, and NF-kB comparing to control group in qRT-PCR analysis. Conclusions. In this study, we found that local BoTA preconditioning yielded significant protection against IR injury in a rat <b>musculocutaneous</b> <b>flap</b> model...|$|E
40|$|Background: There {{is a lack}} of {{information}} about the possibility of transfer of the long head of the biceps femoris (LHBF) <b>musculocutaneous</b> <b>flap</b> to the knee area. We discuss the use of the LHBF <b>musculocutaneous</b> <b>flap</b> to treat refractory ulceration at the popliteal fossa and the results of a preliminary study investigating the anatomical possibility of transferring this flap to the popliteal region. Methods: Five lower extremities of 5 fresh cadaveric specimens were dissected following injection of a silicone compound into the deep femoral artery. We investigated the number, location, and diameter of nutrient branches to the LHBF originating from the deep femoral artery. Based on these results, we treated a 76 -year-old woman with a refractory postradiation ulcer at the popliteal fossa associated with popliteal artery obstruction using a 25 × 7 cm LHBF <b>musculocutaneous</b> <b>flap.</b> Results: The mean number of nutrient branches to the LHBF muscle was 3. 6, with a mean diameter of 1. 9 mm. One to two branches consistently arose from the distal aspect of the posterior thigh. Most branches followed an intramuscular route, giving rise to fine cutaneous branches. The distal border reached by the <b>musculocutaneous</b> <b>flap</b> was located 6. 7 cm distal to the bicondylar line. The flap survived completely without complications, and the patient was able to walk with a walking frame postoperatively. Conclusions: The LHBF <b>musculocutaneous</b> <b>flap</b> may offer a reliable treatment option for soft-tissue defects of the popliteal fossa, especially in patients with significant damage to the popliteal artery from trauma or radiation therapy...|$|E

40|$|BackgroundGroin dissections {{result in}} large wounds with exposed femoral vessels {{requiring}} soft tissue coverage, and the reconstructive options are diverse. In {{this study we}} reviewed our experience {{with the use of}} the pedicled anterolateral thigh and vertical rectus abdominis <b>musculocutaneous</b> <b>flaps</b> in the reconstruction of large groin wounds. MethodsGroin reconstructions performed over a period of 10 years were evaluated, with a mean follow up of two years. We included all cases with large or complex (involving perineum) defects, which were reconstructed with the pedicled anterolateral thigh musculocutaneous or the vertical rectus abdominis <b>musculocutaneous</b> (VRAM) <b>flaps.</b> Smaller wounds which were covered with skin grafts, locally based flaps and pedicled muscle flaps were excluded. ResultsTwenty-three reconstructions were performed for large or complex groin defects, utilising the anterolateral thigh (n= 10) and the vertical rectus abdominis (n= 13) pedicled <b>musculocutaneous</b> <b>flaps.</b> Femoral vein reconstruction with a prosthetic graft was required in one patient, and a combination flap (VRAM and gracilis muscle flap) was performed in another. Satisfactory coverage was achieved in all cases without major complications. No free flaps were used in our series. ConclusionsThe anterolateral thigh and vertical rectus abdominis pedicled <b>musculocutaneous</b> <b>flaps</b> yielded consistent results with little morbidity in the reconstruction of large and complex groin defects.

40|$|Abstract] Objective: To {{observe the}} {{curative}} effect of MEBO {{in combination with}} local <b>musculocutaneous</b> <b>flap</b> transposition in treating Phase bed sore. Method: MEBO was applied on the wound 2 times a day. After one week, <b>musculocutaneous</b> <b>flap</b> transposition was performed when the wound became fresh and when the granulation tissue appeared. Results: All of the 8 cases were healed with first intention. Six of them were followed up for 2 to 24 months. No recurrence happened. Conclusion: For treating Phase bed sore, applying MEBO for about one week and then treating the bedsore with MEBO in combination with <b>musculocutaneous</b> <b>flap</b> transposition could evidently shorten {{the course of the}} disease. [Key words] Phase bed sore; Musculocutaneous flap; MEBO; The treatment of bed sore especially phase bed sore that extends to the bone tissue has ever been a difficult issue in clinic.

40|$|Summary: In {{the era of}} free-flap transfer, the pectoralis major <b>musculocutaneous</b> <b>flap</b> still plays {{a unique}} role in head and neck reconstruction. We report on a patient with a {{recurrent}} hypopharyngeal carcinoma after total pharyngolaryngectomy and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy in whom defects included a circumferential defect of the oropharynx and the entire tongue. The defects were successfully reconstructed with a T-shaped pectoralis major <b>musculocutaneous</b> <b>flap</b> whose skin island included multiple intercostal perforators from the internal mammary vessels. This flap design is effective for reconstructing circumferential pharyngeal defects in vessel-depleted neck...|$|E
40|$|Soft-tissue {{reconstruction}} in {{the knee}} area requires thin, pliable, and tough skin. To resurface the wound, many flaps are used, including free <b>flaps,</b> <b>musculocutaneous</b> <b>flaps,</b> axillary flaps, local flaps, and sometimes distant flaps. However, each flap has disadvantages. In this report, we present 2 cases of soft-tissue defects {{on the surface of}} the patella reconstructed with a pedicled soleus perforator flap, resulting in a successful outcome. Pedicled soleus perforator flaps enable the reconstruction of local soft-tissue defects of the patella without microvascular anastomoses and with minimal donor-site morbidity. We conclude that the pedicled soleus perforator flap is a favorable option for defect coverage around the knee, because of its fast and easy harvesting and very good esthetic results...|$|R
40|$|Hypoperfusion and {{necrosis}} in <b>musculocutaneous</b> <b>flaps</b> {{used for}} reconstruction of tissue defects {{is still a}} significant clinical problem. Although the causes of hypoperfusion are frequently surgical in nature, {{little is known about}} the effects of anaesthetic management on blood flow in flaps or the outcome of flap surgery. We compared in minipigs the effects of halothane and isoflurane anaesthesia in equipotent doses on microcirculatory blood flow (MBF) in the skin and muscle part of <b>musculocutaneous</b> <b>flaps</b> and also in intact (control) skin and muscle. Measurements were made during stable normovolaemic conditions and during mild to moderate hypovolaemia (withdrawal of 5 %, 10 % and 15 % of total blood volume). Multi-channel laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) was used to measure MBF and electromagnetic flowmetry (EMF) for total flap blood flow. During normovolaemic conditions there was no significant difference between the two groups in central haemodynamic or respiratory data. After 15 % blood loss, however, there was a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure and cardiac output in the halothane group while there was no significant change in the isoflurane group (P < 0. 05). MBF in control skin, control muscle and flap muscle remained approximately 10 − 15 % higher in the isoflurane than in the halothane group throughout the study. In the isoflurane group, MBF in flap skin was unchanged during normovolaemia and there was less than 10 % decrease during hypovolaemia. In the halothane group hypovolaemia caused a significant decrease in MBF in flap skin: 27 % decrease after 5 % blood loss, 45 % decrease after 10 % blood loss and 49 % decrease after 15 % blood loss compared with 5 %, 20 % and 21 %, respectively, in intact skin. We conclude that during normovolaemic conditions MBF was well maintained in <b>musculocutaneous</b> <b>flaps</b> in minipigs both with halothane and isoflurane anaesthesia; however, during mild to moderate hypovolemia MBF decreased markedly in flap skin with halothane anaesthesia while it remained unchanged with isofluran...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjective: Sternal osteitis after median {{sternotomy}} {{is associated}} with considerable morbidity and mortality. The use of muscle and omentum flaps has been proved as valid adjunct to combat these severe infections. In this study we present our experience with a more radical approach. Methods: Sternectomy consisted of the resection of the entire sternum, including the costochondral arches and the sternoclavicular joints, and {{was followed by the}} repair of the defect with musculocutaneous flaps without any restabilization of the thoracic wall. Thirteen patients received a vertical rectus abdominis <b>musculocutaneous</b> <b>flap,</b> 14 patients received a pedicled latissimus dorsi <b>musculocutaneous</b> <b>flap,</b> and 12 patients received a free latissimus dorsi <b>musculocutaneous</b> <b>flap</b> (total of 40 flaps in 39 patients of 66 patients who required surgical revision for sternal osteitis of 6078 total patients with sternotomies). Results: Two patients died within 30 days after the operation (early mortality of 5. 1 %); however, they did not die of sternal infection, which was cured without any recurrence in all cases. Seventeen patients (44 %) required secondary, mostly minor operations for local complications. Despite some paradoxic chest movements, the patient satisfaction rating was unanimously high at the long-term follow-up (0. 4 to 8. 5 years, median 2. 3 years). The short- and long-term complication rates were similar in the three groups. Conclusion: We conclude that radical sternectomy and immediate <b>musculocutaneous</b> <b>flap</b> repair provided definitive control of sternal infection in even the most severe cases, thus reducing infection-related mortality. The trade-off was a substantial rate of local complications; however, these did not cause any relevant morbidity. J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2002; 123 : 1185 - 9...|$|E

40|$|Acquired {{chest wall}} defects present a {{challenging}} problem for thoracic surgeons. Many of such defects can be repaired {{with the use}} of local and regional <b>musculocutaneous</b> <b>flaps,</b> but larger defects compromising skeletal structure require increasingly sophisticated reconstructive techniques. The following discussion will review the options for repair acquired chest wall defects based in literature. The authors searched the Pubmed (www. pubmed. com) and found citations from January 1996 to February 2008. By reading the titles and the abstracts most of the citations were discharged because they focused in congenital chest wall defects or were cases report. However, many papers were found describing the outcome of large series of patients with acquired chest wall deformities. A review of recent literature shows that the repair of chest wall defects with soft tissues, if possible, remains the treatment of choice. Large chest wall defects require skeletal reconstruction to prevent paradoxical respiration. The selection of the most appropriate flap is primary dictated by the location {{and the size of the}} defect. It is important to transfer tissue with good vitality, so understanding the vascular supply is imperative. Autogenous grafts have been used in the past for skeletal reconstruction but a combination of synthetic materials with <b>musculocutaneous</b> <b>flaps</b> has been used lately. Based in the literature, the use of prosthetic material in chest wall reconstruction does not significantly increases the risk of wound infection...|$|R

40|$|Posterior {{chest wall}} defects are {{frequently}} encountered after excision of tumors {{as a result}} of trauma or in the setting of wound dehiscence after spine surgery. Various pedicled fasciocutaneous and <b>musculocutaneous</b> <b>flaps</b> have been described for the coverage of these wounds. The advent of perforator flaps has allowed the preservation of muscle function but their bulk is limited. <b>Musculocutaneous</b> <b>flaps</b> remain widely employed. The trapezius and the latissimus dorsi (LD) flaps have been used extensively for upper and middle posterior chest wounds, respectively. Their bulk allows for obliteration of the dead space in deep wounds. The average width of the LD skin paddle is limited to 10 - 12  cm if closure of the donor site is expected without skin grafting. In 2001 a modification of the skin paddle design was introduced in order to allow large flaps to be raised without requiring grafts or flaps for donor site closure. This V-Y pattern allows coverage of large anterior chest defects after mastectomy. We have modified this flap to allow its use for posterior chest wall defects. We describe the flap design, its indications, and its limitations with three clinical cases. Level of Evidence V This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

40|$|Background: Surgical {{resection}} in locally advanced {{breast cancer}} produces large defects {{that may not}} be suitable for primary closure. Immediate reconstruction is controversial and presents a complicated scenario for breast surgeons and plastic surgeons. Methods: In this study, a different design was planned for the latissimus dorsi <b>musculocutaneous</b> <b>flap</b> with primary closure in V-Y for the correction of major lesions in the anterior chest wall. Twenty-five patients underwent immediate locally advanced breast cancer reconstruction with a V-Y latissimus dorsi <b>musculocutaneous</b> <b>flap.</b> This flap was raised from adjacent tissue located on the lateral and posterior thoracic region and presented a triangular shape whose base was the lateral aspect of the mastectomy wound. The technique was indicated in patients with large thoracic wounds. Results: Mean follow-up time was 16 months. Closure was obtained in the donor and recipient sites without the use of skin grafts or other more major procedures. Complications occurred in nine patients (36 percent), including dorsal wound dehiscence in five patients and seroma in three. All cases except one were treated by a conservative approach with a good result. No total flap loss was reported. All patients achieved a satisfactory thoracic reconstruction and adequate wound care. Conclusions: The V-Y latissimus dorsi <b>musculocutaneous</b> <b>flap</b> is a reliable technique for immediate locally advanced breast cancer reconstruction. The technique is advantageous because the V-Y design allows primary closure of the chest wound and donor defect.
