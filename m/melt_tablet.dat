30|$|At San Vito (Mofete {{geothermal}} field), a {{well was}} drilled at 6 ′′ to 3045  m. The well {{had to be}} side tracked two times due to loss of the bottom-hole assembly (BHA) downhole. During drilling of the first lateral, circulation was interrupted leading to gelling and coagulation of the drilling mud around the BHA. Trying to re-establish circulation by perforating the drill string failed as the explosive charge decomposed at elevated bottom-hole temperatures. In the second lateral, measurements with a zinc <b>melting</b> <b>tablet</b> indicated a bottom-hole temperature in excess of 419  °C following a 1 -week shut-in period (Baron and Ungemach 1981; Fournier 1991). Nearby San Vito, high-temperature wells exhibited modest permeability (Buonasorte et al. 1995).|$|R
40|$|Primary nocturnal {{enuresis}} is a prevalent childhood {{condition that}} can persist into adulthood. Desmopressin is an antidiuretic available as orally disintegrating lyophilisate (<b>melt)</b> or solid <b>tablet.</b> Recent findings suggesting different food interactions and clinical characteristics, including compliance, between desmopressin <b>melt</b> and <b>tablet</b> motivated a post hoc {{analysis of a}} previously reported randomised, crossover study. The efficacy of desmopressin <b>melt</b> compared with <b>tablet</b> was evaluated using the International Children's Continence Society (ICCS) responder definitions. Compliance was further analysed using detailed criteria, and the association between efficacy and compliance was examined. In total, 221 patients aged 5 - 15 years, already receiving desmopressin tablets were randomised to the treatment sequence melt (120 / 240 mu g) /tablet (0. 2 / 0. 4 mg) or tablet/melt in two consecutive 3 -week periods. The probability of being a responder (partial or full) during either period was significantly more likely with desmopressin <b>melt</b> compared with <b>tablet</b> (odds ratio, 2. 0; confidence intervals, 1. 07 - 3. 73; p = 0. 03). There was no period effect on compliance in the tablet/melt sequence and {{no difference in the}} number of completely compliant patients in each formulation group; however, more patients were > 75 % compliant in period 1 compared with period 2 in the melt/tablet sequence. Increased compliance was associated with greater reductions in the number of wet nights for both formulations. Conclusions: Desmopressin <b>melt,</b> compared with <b>tablet,</b> improves the probability of being a responder. Switching from <b>tablet</b> to <b>melt</b> formulation increased patient compliance. Increased compliance was associated with increased efficacy. Switching to desmopressin melt may benefit patients with suboptimal responses to desmopressin tablet...|$|R
40|$|Mouth {{dissolving}} tablets {{are also}} known as fast disintegrating, fast dissolving, fast <b>melt,</b> quick <b>melt</b> <b>tablets.</b> Lornoxicam is an NSAID with 100 % bioavailability having a bitter taste. So by formulating it as an ODT the absorption and the bioavailability of the drug will fasten and hence {{the action of the}} drug will be faster. The mode of action of Lornoxicam is mainly by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis (inhibition of cyclooxygeanase enzyme). So {{the purpose of the present}} work is to formulate a taste masked mouth dissolving tablet of Lornoxicam. Taste masking was done by using Eudragit (EPO 100) in different ratios. Three superdisintegrants were used namely sodium starch glycolate, crospovidone, crosscarmellose sodium. The tablets were evaluated for various parameters like hardness, friability, drug content, disintegration and in vivo dissolution. Among all the formulations F 5 showed 98 % drug release with in 15 min. So it was considered as best formulation...|$|R
40|$|Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO-I) {{belong to}} the {{earliest}} drugs tried in Parkinson’s disease (PD). They have been used with or without levodopa (L-DOPA). Non-selective MAO-I due to their side-effect/adverse reaction profile, like tranylcypromine have limited use {{in the treatment of}} depression in PD, while selective, reversible MAO-A inhibitors are recommended due to their easier clinical handling. For the treatment of akinesia and motor fluctuations selective irreversible MAO-B inhibitors selegiline and rasagiline are recommended. They are safe and well tolerated at the recommended daily doses. Their main differences are related to (1) metabolism, (2) interaction with CYP-enzymes and (3) quantitative properties at the molecular biological/genetic level. Rasagiline is more potent in clinical practise and has a hypothesis driven more favourable side effect/adverse reaction profile due to its metabolism to aminoindan. Both selegiline and rasagiline have a neuroprotective and neurorestaurative potential. A head-to head clinical trial would be of utmost interest from both the clinical outcome and a hypothesis-driven point of view. Selegiline is available as <b>tablet</b> and <b>melting</b> <b>tablet</b> for PD and as transdermal selegiline for depression, while rasagiline is marketed as tablet for PD. In general, the clinical use of MAO-I nowadays is underestimated. There should be more efforts to evaluate their clinical potency as antidepressants and antidementive drugs in addition to the final proof of their disease-modifying potential. In line with this are recent innovative developments of MAO-I plus inhibition of acetyl-choline esterase for Alzheimer’s disease as well as combined MAO-I and iron chelation for PD...|$|R
5000|$|Ya ba tablets {{typically}} are consumed orally. Another common method is called [...] "chasing the dragon". Users place the ya ba tablet on {{aluminum foil and}} heat it from below. As the <b>tablet</b> <b>melts,</b> vapors rise and are inhaled. The drug also may be administered by crushing the tablets into powder, which is then snorted or mixed with a solvent and injected. When swallowed in pill form {{the duration of the}} drug's effect is between 8-16 hours, as compared to 1-3 hours when smoked, while the intensity is considerably reduced. The peak of the drug's effect is followed by a come down period lasting 6-10 hours, during which the user may have difficulty sleeping or eating. Many users report that it takes them up to 24 hours after consumption to be able to fall asleep.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} {{influence}} of body weight and missed doses on lopinavir pharmacokinetics with standard and increased doses of lopinavir/ritonavir <b>melt</b> extrusion <b>tablets</b> during late pregnancy. Patients and methods: Lopinavir concentration data during the third trimester of pregnancy were pooled from clinical trials in Thailand (NCT 00409591) and the USA (NCT 00042289). A total of 154 HIV-infected pregnant women receiving either 400 / 100 mg (standard) or 600 / 150 mg (increased) twice daily had lopinavir plasma concentration data available. Population parameters were estimated using non-linear mixed-effects regression models. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to estimate the probability of achieving target lopinavir trough concentrations (> 1. 0 mg/L) with standard and increased doses of lopinavir/ritonavir during pregnancy. Results: The median (range) age, weight and gestational age were 28 years (18 - 43), 62 kg (45 - 123) and 33 weeks (29 - 38), respectively. Body weight influenced lopinavir oral clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution (V/F). Population estimates of lopinavir CL/F and V/F were 6. 21 L/h/ 70 kg and 52. 6 L/ 70 kg, respectively. Based on simulations, the highest risk of subtherapeutic trough concentrations was for women weighing > 100 kg using the standard dose (similar to 7 %), while the risk was, 2 % with the 600 / 150 mg dose for women weighing 40 - 130 kg. After a missed dose, 61 % of women have lopinavir concentrations below target prior to the next dose with the standard dose compared with 42 % with the increased dose. Conclusions: Standard dosing provides adequate lopinavir trough concentrations {{for the majority of}} pregnant women but increased doses may be preferable for women weighing. 100 kg and with a history of lopinavir/ritonavir use and/or adherence issues...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{transformation}} of pyroxene to its high-pressure polymorph akimotoite (MgSiO 3 ilmenite type structure) is {{documented in the}} shock-induced melt veins of the L 6 Tenham chondrite. Four textural relationships between pyroxene and akimotoite are observed in former pyroxene grains entrained in the shear melt vein and in pyroxene grains attached {{to the wall of}} the melt vein. In one of the entrained enstatite grains the transformation to akimotoite is partial. One third of the grain is transformed to a polycrystalline aggregate of akimotoite with a scalloped interface with enstatite. Akimotoite (Fe 0, 4 Mg 1, 24 Ca 0. 07 Na 0, 12 Al 0, 14) (Si 1, 963 Al 0, 037) O 6 is slightly enriched in Ca (CaO = 1. 74 %), Al and Na with respect to enstatite (CaO = 0. 71 %). Narrow bands of polycrystalline akimotoite with three crystallographic orientations and a chemical composition similar to the surrounding enstatite intersect {{the other part of the}} grain. In a second grain entrained in the shear <b>melt</b> vein, <b>tablets</b> of akimotoite are interwoven with a pyroxene glass with a lower Na and Fe content and a higher Mg content compared to the adjacent akimotoite. This pyroxene glass is probably the product of (Mg,Fe) SiO 3 -perovskite amorphization. Polycrystalline akimotoite is also formed at the expense of enstatite at the vein wall of the shear melt vein. In that case akimotoite is also enriched in Ca (CaO = 2. 85 %) Na (NaO = 1. 72 %) and Al (Al 2 O 3 = 4. 14 %). All these observations suggest that akimotoite is mainly formed by solid-state {{transformation of}} former pyroxenes with subsequent diffusion of calcium, aluminum and sodium from the chondritic melt of the shear melt vein. Finally, the first complete X-ray diffraction pattern of natural akimotoite is presented...|$|R
40|$|Curcumin {{suffers from}} the {{limitation}} of poor solubility and low dissolution {{that can lead to}} limited applications. The investigation was aimed to substantiate the potentiality of <b>melt</b> sonocrystallized gastroretentive <b>tablets</b> of curcumin. <b>Melt</b> sonocrystallized curcumin (MSC CMN) was developed and its therapeutic potential was validated by in vitro cytotoxicity studies against Human oral cancer cell line KB. MSC curcumin was then formulated as floating tablet and evaluated. MSC form of CMN exhibited 2. 36 -fold and 2. 40 -fold solubility enhancement in distilled water and phosphate buffer, pH 4. 5, respectively, better flow properties and intrinsic dissolution rate (0. 242 ± 1. 42 and 0. 195 ± 1. 26 mg/cm 2 /min) in comparison to its original form. The GI 50 value of MSC CMN was found to be less than 10, specifying inhibition of growth more effectively at its least concentration by 50 %. The gastroretentive-floating tablet (Formulation F 4) displayed controlled drug release (96. 22 % ± 1. 43 %) for over 12 h. The present study revealed melt sonocrystallization can be used to produce particles with superior biopharmaceutical properties without the use of organic solvents or the addition of other excipients, and amenable to formulation in to a pharmaceutical dosage form...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of {{present study was}} to evaluate the effect of processing methods and sintering condition on matrix formation and subsequent drug release from wax matrix tablets for controlled release. Ketorolac tromethamine and compritol were processed with appropriate diluent using either dry blending, spray drying, partial melt granulation or <b>melt</b> granulation. The <b>tablets</b> were then sintered at 80 &# 906;. The sintered tablets were characterized by their physical parameters and in vitro dissolution tests. The micro-morphology and wettability of the tablets was also investigated. It was evident that different processing methods for identical formulation significant impact the release profile of drug. Sintering further retarded drug release and its effect was related to the manufacturing processes. Scanning electron microscopy showed that heat treatment redistributed the wax and formed a film-like structure covering drug and excipient particle. The contact angle of tablets made by dry blending, spray drying and partial melt granulation methods increased after sintering, while that of <b>tablets</b> made by <b>melt</b> granulation remained constant. Drug release from the wax tablets with or without heat treatment was best described by the Higuchi equation. Different processing methods produced different matrix structures that resulted in different drug release rates. Sintering retarded drug release mainly by decreasing the porosity of the matrix. Contact angle measurement and SEM analysis indicated that heat treatment caused the wax to melt, redistribute, coat the drug and diluents and form a network structure. Differential scanning calorimetry studies ruled out the occurrence of solid solution of the drug during sintering condition...|$|R
40|$|Orally-administered controlled-release drug {{delivery}} systems {{are associated with}} the short- comings of relatively short residence times in the human stomach as well as highly variable gastrointestinal (GI) transit times. Thus, considerable intra-individual and inter-individual differences in the bioavailability of drugs are observable. There are numerous drug substances which may benefit from prolonged and controlled GI passage times. As a solution to the problem, gastroretentive {{drug delivery}} systems (GRDDS), which feature an enhanced gastric residence time (GRT), were developed. Several gastric retention approaches, such as flotation, have been proposed and analyzed. Despite the extensive research performed in the field of GRDDS, the development, the production, and the evaluation of floating devices are still challenging. The aim of the thesis was {{to come up with a}} formulation strategy which facilitates the design of innovative floating drug delivery systems (FDDS). Hydrophilic and lipophilic floating formulations were prepared by wet granulation and <b>melt</b> granulation, respectively. <b>Tablets</b> with an inherent density of less than unity were compacted using porous functionalized calcium carbonate (FCC) as matrix-forming component. For the concurrent assessment of drug release by UV/Vis spectroscopy and floating behavior by visual observation, a custom-built stomach model method was set up. Our in vitro evaluation method was combined with in silico dissolution simulations to analyze the floating force as a function of drug release. To determine the in vivo gastric retention potential of FCC-based FDDS, a study protocol has been proposed for the assessment of the stomach residence time of floating tablets and non-floating references in humans. The production of tablets and mini-tablets, which met the requirements for immediately floating tablets (i. e. inherently low density accompanied by sufficient hardness), was possible due to the characteristic lamellar structures of the FCC particles. The tablets showed no floating lag time and remained afloat until complete release of the model drug substance caffeine. For the hydrophilic formulation, the drug release was erosion-controlled and the flotation mechanism was a reaction-based erosion mechanism with gelation-layer-forming polymers as imbibition-inhibiting and gas-entrapping components. In the case of the lipophilic formulations, flotation was achieved by slowing-down and/or inhibiting the reaction-based erosion of FCC due to hydrophobization of the particle’s stratum layer; the release of the drug was diffusion-controlled and erosion-controlled. A FDDS formulation design tool box (including the novel pharmaceutical excipient FCC, an in vitro stomach model, an in silico tablet dissolution simulation approach, and an in vivo clinical study concept) was proposed to assist the future formulation development, the production, and the analysis of innovative FDDS. We introduced and applied a classification system, including an “ideal” floating performance (i. e. no floating lag time, maintaining of the floating force until complete drug release, followed by a decrease of the floating capability) to categorize experimentally observed flotation behavior. It was shown that FCC is an enabling excipient for the manufacture of FDDS and the preparation of formulations with an “ideal” floating behavior was possible. The results of the in vivo experiment provided a first evidence for the gastric retention potential of FCC-based floating tablets in humans. ...|$|R
