At the time of their partnership, Donatello was already well known for his statues of prophets and saints for the Duomo and Orsanmichele, while Michelozzo was <b>more</b> <b>obscure.</b> Both had worked for a time for Ghiberti, whose workshop then led Florentine sculpture.|$|E

5|$|Aldfrith ruled both Bernicia and Deira {{throughout}} his reign, {{but the two}} parts remained distinct, and would again be divided by the Vikings in the late 9th century. The centre of Bernicia lay in the region around the later Anglo-Scottish border, with Lindisfarne, Hexham, Bamburgh, and Yeavering being important religious and royal centres. Even after Ecgfrith's death, Bernicia included much of modern southeast Scotland, with a presumed royal centre at Dunbar, and religious centres at Coldingham and Melrose. The details of the early Middle Ages in northwest England and southwest Scotland are <b>more</b> <b>obscure,</b> but a Bishop of Whithorn is known from shortly after Aldfrith's reign. York, Catterick, Ripon, and Whitby {{appear to have been}} important sites in Deira.|$|E
5|$|At this time, Disney also {{encouraged}} {{his staff to}} see a variety of films. These ranged from the mainstream, such as MGM's Romeo and Juliet (1936)— to which Disney made direct reference in a story meeting pertaining to the scene in which Snow White lies in her glass coffin— to the <b>more</b> <b>obscure,</b> including European silent cinema. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, {{as well as the}} two Disney films to follow it, were also influenced by such German expressionist films as Nosferatu (1922) and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1919), both of which were recommended by Disney to his staff. This influence is particularly evident in the scenes of Snow White fleeing through the forest and the Queen's transformation into the Witch. The latter scene was also inspired by Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931), to which Disney made specific reference in story meetings.|$|E
5|$|Ragnall {{is known}} to have left two sons: Ruaidrí (died 1247?) and Domnall. Domnall's line, the meic Domnaill (or Clann Domnaill), went on to produce the {{powerful}} Lords of the Isles who dominated the entire Hebrides and expansive mainland-territories from {{the first half of the}} fourteenth- to the late fifteenth centuries. Ruaidrí founded the meic Ruaidrí (or Clann Ruaidrí), a <b>more</b> <b>obscure</b> kindred who were seated in Garmoran. Ruaidrí seems to have been the senior of Ragnall's sons, and is first recorded by name in 1214. Four years previous, Áengus and his sons are recorded by the Chronicle of Mann to have been slain on Skye. This particular record could be evidence that Áengus had succeeded Ragnall, after which the latter's sons extinguished Áengus's line, and Ruaidrí assumed control of the meic Somairle succession.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} of mania are the following: heightened mood (either euphoric or irritable); flight {{of ideas and}} pressure of speech; and increased energy, decreased need for sleep, and hyperactivity. They are most plainly evident in fully developed hypomanic states; in full-blown mania, however, they undergo progressively severe exacerbations and become <b>more</b> and <b>more</b> <b>obscured</b> by other signs and symptoms, such as delusions and fragmentation of behavior.|$|R
5000|$|Because many of {{the shapes}} in {{graphical}} environments are relatively simple, and complex shadows are difficult to render, many graphics engines employ a [...] "fog" [...] gradient so objects further from the camera are progressively <b>more</b> <b>obscured</b> by haze and by aerial perspective. This technique simulates the effect of light scattering, which causes more distant objects to appear lower in contrast, especially in outdoor environments.|$|R
50|$|In {{numerous}} editions {{from the}} 1960s through the 1980s, Guinness stated thatNo single subject is <b>more</b> <b>obscured</b> by vanity, deceit, falsehood, and deliberate fraud than {{the extremes of}} human longevity.Despite demographic evidence of the known extremes of modern longevity, stories in otherwise reliable sources still surface regularly, stating that these extremes have been exceeded. Responsible, modern, scientific validation of human longevity requires investigation of records following an individual from birth to the present (or to death); purported longevity far outside the demonstrated records regularly fail such scrutiny.|$|R

50|$|Propaganda is a {{way that}} {{politics}} can be represented and manipulated in film. Leif Furhammar and Folke Isaksson credit Russian producers Sergei Eisenstein and Vsevolod Pudovkin {{with the birth of}} propaganda aesthetics, for which the underlying assumption was that by manipulating cinematic images representing reality, they could manipulate spectators' concepts of reality. Documentaries can be an even more effective form of propaganda than other genre films because the form of representation claims to mirror reality, making the manipulation of an audience that much <b>more</b> <b>obscured.</b>|$|R

50|$|As {{can be seen}} by {{the example}} of Mercury, which is <b>more</b> <b>obscured</b> by being occidental, sect is a form of astrological polarity, much as the {{distinction}} between masculine and feminine planets. Since some planets were seen to be stronger in a positive or masculine environment, and others were seen to be more effective in a negative or feminine environment, whether a planet is in sect in any given chart was of particular importance to Hellenistic astrologers, who gave sect greater weight than any other astrological factor. The luminary of sect is the luminary which is said to rule each sect.|$|R
