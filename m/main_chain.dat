As the TEM image shown in Fig. S 4 A, it could be seen clearly {{that a lot of}} cores (black domains) generated at the initial time.

These apparent hydrophilic chains and the grafted hydrophilic PNVCL chains stretched into aqueous medium to form a hydrophilic corona to stabilize the micelles (as the amplified graph shown in Fig.  3). Because of the hydrogen bonding and the hydrophobic interactions between the <b>main</b> <b>chains</b> of the copolymers, several mono micelles would link together to generate the reported pod-like supramicelles with several hydrophobic cores and a supra hydrophilic corona, as shown in Fig.  3.

25|$|Balanced charge {{injection}} {{and transfer}} {{are required to}} get high internal efficiency, pure emission of luminance layer without contaminated emission from charge transporting layers, and high stability. A common way to balance charge is optimizing {{the thickness of the}} charge transporting layers but is hard to control. Another way is using the exciplex. Exciplex formed between hole-transporting (p-type) and electron-transporting (n-type) side chains to localize electron-hole pairs.

25|$|An {{important}} microstructural {{feature of}} a polymer is its architecture and shape, which {{relates to the}} way branch points lead to a deviation from a simple linear chain. A branched polymer molecule is composed of a <b>main</b> <b>chain</b> {{with one or more}} substituent side chains or branches. Types of branched polymers include star polymers, comb polymers, brush polymers, dendronized polymers, ladder polymers, and dendrimers. There exist also two-dimensional polymers which are composed of topologically planar repeat units. A polymer's architecture affects many of its physical properties including, but not limited to, solution viscosity, melt viscosity, solubility in various solvents, glass transition temperature and the size of individual polymer coils in solution. A variety of techniques may be employed for the synthesis of a polymeric material with a range of architectures, for example Living polymerization.|$|E

The bridge uses a double cantilever system where two opposing cantilevers are supported by suspension chains giving it {{the appearance of a}} classic suspension bridge. The span of the bridge is 155 ft and the two <b>main</b> <b>chains</b> are 17 ft apart. Each of the <b>main</b> <b>chains</b> is made from a series of wrought-iron eye-rods varying in length from 6 ft to 7 ft and with a nominal diameter of 7/8 in.

The chains consist of twelve parallel rods at the tower and progressively reduce in width by one link at each joint towards each end of the chains as they get further from the towers. The decking is of timber, supported on trussed wrought-iron transoms.|$|R

25|$|The Eiger {{does not}} {{properly}} {{form part of}} the <b>main</b> <b>chain</b> of the Bernese Alps, which borders the canton of Valais and forms the watershed between the Rhine and the Rhône, but constitutes a huge limestone buttress, projecting from the crystalline basement of the Mönch across the Eigerjoch. Consequently, {{all sides of the}} mountain feed the same river, the Lütschine, through the Weisse Lütschine on the west side (west face of the Eiger) and through the Schwarze Lütschine on the east side (north and east faces of the Eiger). Therefore, all the water running down the Eiger converges {{at the foot of the}} Männlichen in Zweilütschinen, 10km northwest of the summit, where the Lütschine proper begins its course to Lake Brienz and the Aare. Although the north face of the Eiger is almost free of ice, significant glaciers lie at the other sides of the mountain. The Eiger Glacier flows on the west side of the Eiger, from the crest connecting it to the Mönch down to 2,400 m, south of Eigergletscher railway station, and feeds the Weisse Lütschine, through the Trümmelbach. On the east side, the Eismeer (well visible from the windows of Eismeer railway station) flows from the Mönch down to 1,300 m through the Lower Grindelwald Glacier system, which feeds the Schwarze Lütschine.|$|E
25|$|Potassium ion {{channels}} {{remove the}} hydration shell from the ion when {{it enters the}} selectivity filter. The selectivity filter is formed by a five residue sequence, TVGYG, termed the signature sequence, {{within each of the}} four subunits. This signature sequence is within a loop between the pore helix and TM2/6, historically termed the P-loop. This signature sequence is highly conserved, with the exception that a valine residue in prokaryotic potassium channels is often substituted with an isoleucine residue in eukaryotic channels. This sequence adopts a unique <b>main</b> <b>chain</b> structure, structurally analogous to a nest protein structural motif. The four sets of electronegative carbonyl oxygen atoms are aligned {{toward the center of the}} filter pore and form a square anti-prism similar to a water-solvating shell around each potassium binding site. The distance between the carbonyl oxygens and potassium ions in the binding sites of the selectivity filter is the same as between water oxygens in the first hydration shell and a potassium ion in water solution, providing an energetically-favorable route for de-solvation of the ions. This width appears to be maintained by hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces within a sheet of aromatic amino acid residues surrounding the selectivity filter. The selectivity filter opens towards the extracellular solution, exposing four carbonyl oxygens in a glycine residue (Gly79 in KcsA). The next residue toward the extracellular side of the protein is the negatively charged Asp80 (KcsA). This residue together with the five filter residues form the pore that connects the water-filled cavity in the center of the protein with the extracellular solution.|$|E

2500|$|It {{was found}} that the {{reaction}} of chymotrypsin with its substrate takes place in two stages, an initial “burst” phase {{at the beginning of the}} reaction and a steady-state phase following Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The mode of action of chymotrypsin explains this as hydrolysis takes place in two steps. First acylation of the substrate to form an acyl-enzyme intermediate and then deacylation in order to return the enzyme to its original state. This occurs via the concerted action of the three amino acid residues in the catalytic triad. [...] Aspartate hydrogen bonds to the N-δ hydrogen of histidine, increasing the pKa of its ε nitrogen and thus making it able to deprotonate serine. It is this deprotonation that allows the serine side chain to act as a nucleophile and bind to the electron-deficient carbonyl carbon of the protein <b>main</b> <b>chain.</b> Ionization of the carbonyl oxygen is stabilized by formation of two hydrogen bonds to adjacent <b>main</b> <b>chain</b> N-hydrogens. This occurs in the oxyanion hole. This forms a tetrahedral adduct and breakage of the peptide bond. An acyl-enzyme intermediate, bound to the serine, is formed, and the newly formed amino terminus of the cleaved protein can dissociate. In the second reaction step, a water molecule is activated by the basic histidine, and acts as a nucleophile. The oxygen of water attacks the carbonyl carbon of the serine-bound acyl group, resulting in formation of a second tetrahedral adduct, regeneration of the serine -OH group, and release of a proton, as well as the protein fragment with the newly formed carboxyl terminus ...|$|E
