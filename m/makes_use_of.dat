5|$|A {{scene in}} the episode shows Grampa and Bart driving to Branson with Marge's car, {{listening}} to the radio. Because the scene consists entirely of auditive gags, the Simpsons staff had difficulty figuring out what to show visually during the scene. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, Jean explained that these scenes “get a really big laugh at the table,” but are subsequently hard for the animators. The scene <b>makes</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a repeated background, an animation technique made famous by Hanna-Barbera in order to cut budget.|$|E

An air conditioned hardtop version of the extended model is often used by officers, and a version developed for riot control has clear polycarbonate shielding along the rear sides and roof, as well as gunports for less-lethal weapons. The shielding allows for a wide field of view {{while at the same}} time protecting against firebombs and rock-throwing.|$|E

In the surviving evidence, Chrysippus frequently <b>makes</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the categories of substance and quality, but makes little use {{of the other two}} Stoic categories (somehow disposed and somehow disposed in relation to something). It is not clear whether the categories had any special significance for Chrysippus, and a clear doctrine of categories may be the work of later Stoics.|$|E
5|$|For giant stars, the {{atmospheric}} microturbulence {{can result in}} line broadening that is much larger than effects of rotational, effectively drowning out the signal. However, an alternate approach can be employed that <b>makes</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> gravitational microlensing events. These occur when a massive object passes {{in front of the}} more distant star and functions like a lens, briefly magnifying the image. The more detailed information gathered by this means allows the effects of microturbulence to be distinguished from rotation.|$|E
