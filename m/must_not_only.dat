5|$|Aside from {{overseeing}} the new clergy, Soegijapranata {{continued to work}} towards Catholic education and prosperity, similar to his pre-war work. He emphasised that students <b>must</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> be good Catholics, but also good Indonesians. The Church began further development of its schools, ranging from elementary schools to universities. Soegijapranata also began reforming the Church in his apostolic vicariate, making it more Indonesian. He advocated the use of local languages and Indonesian during mass, allowing it throughout his diocese beginning in 1956. In addition, he pressed {{for the use of}} gamelan music to accompany services, and agreed to the use of wayang shows to teach the Bible to children.|$|E
5|$|The Capobiancos {{argued that}} {{it takes more than}} mere biology to invoke the {{provisions}} of the ICWA, and under South Carolina law, a father <b>must</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> reside with the mother for the six-month period preceding the birth of the child but also contribute to pregnancy-related expenses in order to have paternity rights. However, the Court determined that the ICWA does not defer to state law, and the trial court properly determined that the ICWA grants Indian fathers greater rights than state law.|$|E
5|$|Primary and {{secondary}} school teachers begin their teacher education at the University of Malta by gaining a Bachelor of Education (Honours), which typically takes four years of study to achieve. To gain entry into the University to study primary or secondary education, students <b>must</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> meet the University's general entry requirements but also {{a number of other}} special course requirements. University students seeking to enter the teaching profession may also become qualified by gaining a postgraduate certificate in education. Two years of professional teaching practice is also generally required. The Minister for Education may also grant a temporary warrant to teach, valid for one year, to any person the Minister believes has the ability to teach in the country.|$|E

25|$|To fully engage and {{challenge}} the learner, {{the task and}} learning environment should reflect {{the complexity of the}} environment that the learner should be able to function in at the end of learning. Learners <b>must</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> have ownership of the learning or problem-solving process, but of the problem itself (Derry 1999).|$|E
25|$|Properly then, {{positions}} have {{dimension of}} affine length, while displacements have dimension of vector length. To assign a number to an affine unit, one <b>must</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> choose {{a unit of}} measurement, but also a point of reference, while to assign a number to a vector unit only requires a unit of measurement.|$|E
25|$|In sum, the {{argument}} is that an understanding of the mental disorders <b>must</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> have a specific knowledge of brain constituents and genetics (inside-the-skin) but also the context (outside-the-skin) in which these parts operate (Koch and Laurent, 1999). Only by joining neurology and psychiatry, it is argued, can this nexus be used to reduce human suffering.|$|E

25|$|A farm, however far pushed, will under proper {{cultivation}} {{continue to}} yield forever a constant crop. But in a mine {{there is no}} reproduction, and the produce once pushed to the utmost will soon begin to fail and sink towards zero.

25|$|Humans are bipedal with an erect stance. The erect posture {{causes the}} weight of the {{abdominal}} contents to thrust on the pelvic floor, a complex structure which <b>must</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> support this weight but allow, in women, three channels to pass through it: the urethra, the vagina and the rectum.

25|$|In their visions, these mystics {{would enter}} into the {{celestial}} realms and journey through the seven stages of mystical ascent: the Seven Heavens and seven throne rooms. Such a journey is fraught with great danger, and the adept <b>must</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> have made elaborate purification preparation, but must also know the proper incantations, seals and angelic names needed {{to get past the}} fierce angelic guards, as well as know how to navigate the various forces at work inside and outside the palaces.|$|E
25|$|The {{average length}} of time that posts are {{able to stay in}} the group before being deleted is {{commonly}} called the retention time. Generally the larger Usenet servers have enough capacity to archive several years of binary content even when flooded with new data at the maximum daily speed available. A good binaries service provider <b>must</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> accommodate users of fast connections (3 megabit) but also users of slow connections (256 kilobit or less) who need more time to download content {{over a period of several}} days or weeks.|$|E

A mysterious anomaly is causing distortions in the Real World and Digimon are being plagued by a virus that turns them hostile. These circumstances lead to the DigiDestined being reunited with their partner Digimon.

25|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the eclipse, many {{counterfeit}} glasses were put up for sale. Effective eclipse glasses <b>must</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> block most visible light, but most UV and infrared light as well. For visible light, the user should only be able to see the Sun, sunglint reflected off shiny metal, halogen bulbs, the filament in unfrosted incandescent bulbs, and similarly intense sources. Determining whether the glasses effectively block enough UV and infrared light requires the use of spectrophotometer, which is a rather expensive piece of lab equipment.|$|E
25|$|In {{most cases}} prior to 1988, {{specific}} countries often provided peacekeepers. At that point, only twenty six countries had sent personnel {{to participate in}} peacekeeping deployments. Today, that number has risen to more than eighty. This results in an extremely heterogeneous group. Thus, UN Peacekeeping deployments <b>must</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> contend with language complications, but also myriad cultural and social differences that can create operational difficulties {{that are hard to}} overcome. These difference can create problems with regard to interactions (whether personal or between institutions/units), misunderstandings, inadvertent offensive behaviour and prejudices that may be associated with a particular contingent from a given country.|$|E
25|$|The rule of {{fair hearing}} {{requires}} that persons {{liable to be}} directly affected by the outcome of any decision must be given prior notification of the action proposed to be taken, {{of the time and}} place of any hearing that is to be conducted, and of the charge or case they will be called upon to meet. There is also a necessary implication that notice <b>must</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> be given, but that it must be sufficient and accurate. People should be told clearly what cases they are to meet and the cases against them should not be left to conjecture.|$|E
