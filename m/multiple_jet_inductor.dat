40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{mathematical model}} has been developed to simulate the compressible jets flow from the top-blown lance with multi-nozzles in converter to a free surrounding domain. The variations of fluid density and viscosity, high temperature, and Mach number were taken into consideration in this model which was validated against the physical modeling results. More specifically, computations were obtained to compare the widely used realizable k-epsilon turbulence model against the standard k-omega turbulence model, which shows that the latter one is superior to calculate diverse turbulent conditions within the <b>multiple</b> <b>jets.</b> Moreover, the coalescence pattern of the <b>multiple</b> <b>jets</b> has been illustrated by their Mach number distribution, and each individual jet proceeds in a curve course, bending to the lance center and tending to unite. The effects of the inclination angles on the jets coalescence were also investigated, which indicates that the lower the inclination angle is, the stronger the interfering extent between the <b>multiple</b> <b>jets</b> is. With the help of this model, the dynamic power of the <b>multiple</b> <b>jets</b> to support the cavity formation was demonstrated, and additionally, a mathematical model concerning the effective penetration radius and digressing path of the <b>multiple</b> <b>jets</b> was proposed by taking the inclination angle and the axial distance from the nozzle tips as arguments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. On the {{condition}} of water <b>multiple</b> <b>jet</b> impingements, a steady-state experimental study had been conducted for boiling heat transfer in an atmospheric pressure. The jet velocity was 0. 95 ~ 1. 59 m/s and the sub-cooling degrees of jet fluid were 30 ~ 83 â„ƒ. The results revealed that increasing either jet velocity or sub-cooling degrees would promote the heat flux through heated surface, and the effect was more pronounced in partial boiling regime than fully-developed boiling regime. The heat transfer with <b>multiple</b> <b>jets</b> is enhanced due to disturbance of different impingements. With modification of the factor which related to flow distance of fluid on heated surface, correlation which is applicable to one single impinging jet boiling, {{can also be used}} to calculate critical heat flux(CHF) in boiling heat transfer with <b>multiple</b> impinging <b>jets...</b>|$|R

Spatial fuel distribution and degree of vaporization were measured using jet A fuel. Two types of air blast injectors were tested, a splash groove injector and a <b>multiple</b> <b>jet</b> cross stream injector. Air swirlers with vane angles of 15 deg and 30 deg were used to improve the spatial fuel distribution in a 12 cm diameter tubular rig. Distribution and vaporization measurements were made 35. 5 cm downstream of the injector. The spatial fuel distribution was nearly uniform with the <b>multiple</b> <b>jet</b> contrastream injector and the splash-groove injector with a 30 deg air swirler. The vaporization was nearly 100 percent at an inlet air temperature of 600 K, and at 800 K inlet air temperature fuel oxidation reactions were observed.

40|$|Domestic and {{industrial}} wastewater effluents are often discharged into rivers after some treatment. An {{effective way of}} rapidly reducing effluent concentrations to acceptable levels within a mixing zone is to discharge the effluent {{in the form of}} <b>multiple</b> <b>jets</b> into a coflowing river flow at some distance from the riverbank. An accurate and efficient predictive model of <b>multiple</b> coflowing <b>jets</b> is required for impact and risk assessment of environmental discharges into rivers. In the present study, a new semi-analytical model for <b>multiple</b> coflowing <b>jets</b> is developed using the method of superposition based on Reichardt's hypothesis.

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} from a discrete heat source to multiple, normally impinging, confined air jets was experimentally investigated. The jets issued from short, square-edged orifices with still-developing velocity profiles on to a foil heat source which produced a constant heat flux. The orifice plate {{and the surface}} containing the heat source were mounted opposite {{each other in a}} parallel-plates arrangement to effect radial outflow of the spent fluid. The local surface temperature was measured in fine increments over the entire heat source. Experiments were conducted for different jet Reynolds numbers (5000,Re, 20, 000), orifice-to-target spacing ~ 0. 5,H/d, 4 !, and multiple-orifice arrangements. The results are compared to those previously obtained for single air jets. A reduction in orifice-to-target spacing was found to increase the heat transfer coefficient in <b>multiple</b> <b>jets,</b> with this effect being stronger at the higher Reynolds numbers. With a nine-jet arrangement, the heat transfer to the central jet was higher than for a corresponding single jet. For a four-jet arrangement, however, each jet was found to have stagnationregion heat transfer coefficients that were comparable to the single-jet values. The effectiveness of single and <b>multiple</b> <b>jets</b> in removing heat from a given heat source is compared at a fixed total flow rate. Predictive correlations are proposed for single and <b>multiple</b> <b>jet</b> impingement heat transfer...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{advantages}} of Reichardt's hypothesis {{in dealing with}} single and <b>multiple</b> circular <b>jets</b> in a stagnant environment are highlighted. The stages involved {{in the development of}} the point source method, an offshoot of the new hypothesis, are presented. Previous results of experiments on <b>multiple</b> circular <b>jets</b> in a stagnant environment justify the method of superposition. As a prelude to discussion of <b>multiple</b> <b>jets</b> in a co-flowing stream, results on the excess-velocity decay, the growth of the shear layer, and the dilutions for a single jet based on Reichardt's hypothesis are presented. The spreading hypothesis is generalized by introducing a link factor kl to account for the co-flowing stream. The distribution of excess-momentum flux uÎ”u is shown to be Gaussian in nature. Based on the principle of superposition, the decay of the maximum excess velocity and the dilution are predicted for odd and even numbers of jets in an array.

40|$|Abstractâ€”There {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} in the oxygenation by plunging water jets {{in the last few}} years due to their inherent advantages, like energy-efficient, low operation cost, etc. Though a lot of work has been reported on the oxygen-transfer by single plunging water jets but very few studies have been carried out using <b>multiple</b> plunging <b>jets.</b> In this paper, volumetric oxygen-transfer coefficient and oxygen-transfer efficiency has been studied experimentally for <b>multiple</b> inclined plunging <b>jets</b> (having jet plunge 0 angle of 60) in a pool of water for different configurations, in terms of varying number of jets and jet diameters. This research suggests that the volumetric oxygen-transfer coefficient and oxygentransfer efficiency of the <b>multiple</b> inclined plunging <b>jets</b> for air-water system are significantly higher than those of a single vertical as well as inclined plunging jet for same flow area and other similar conditions. The study also reveals that the oxygen-transfer increase with increase in number of <b>multiple</b> <b>jets</b> under similar conditions, which will be most advantageous and energy-efficient in practical situations when large volumes of wastewaters are to be treated. A relationship between volumetric oxygen-transfer coefficient and jet parameters is also proposed.
