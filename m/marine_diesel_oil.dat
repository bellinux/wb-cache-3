40|$|<b>Diesel</b> <b>oil</b> is {{a complex}} mixture of {{hydrocarbons}} with an average carbon number of C 8 – C 26. The majority of components consist of alkanes, both straight chained and branched and aromatic compounds including mono-, di- and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Regardless of this complexity, <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> can be readily degraded {{by a number of}} soil microorganisms making it a likely candidate for bioremediation. The concept of using plants to enhance bioremediation, termed phytoremediation, is a relatively new area of scientific interest. It is particularly applicable to <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> contamination as <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> generally contaminates the top few metres of soil (surface soil) and contamination is not uniform throughout the site. By encouraging plants to grow on <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> contaminated soil, conditions are improved for the microbial degradation of the contaminant. During this study, establishing plants on <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> contaminated soil proved difficult. <b>Diesel</b> <b>oil</b> is phytotoxic to plants at relatively low concentrations. At concentrations below this phytotoxic level, the development of plants grown in <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> contaminated soil differs greatly from plants grown in uncontaminated soil. Tolerance of plants to <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> and ability to germinate in <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> contaminated soil varied greatly between plant species as well as within plant species.

In order to study the mechanisms for reduction in the injection pressure of low permeability wells by the SNPA-diesel oil system injection, the microstructure of SNPAs was observed with a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The particle size distribution of SNPAs was also measured by the laser scattering method. The viscosities of <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> and SNPA-diesel oil system were measured with a capillary viscometer. The effect of SNPAs on the solubility of wax in the <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> was experimentally studied. The influencing factors, including temperature and SNPA concentration in <b>diesel</b> <b>oil,</b> on wax solubility were analyzed. A pore-throat film displacement model (PTFDM) was built for mechanism explanation. The microstructure and size distribution analyses show that the SNPAs are in the nanometer size range. The viscosity of the SNPA-diesel oil system is lower than that of the <b>diesel</b> <b>oil.</b> The solubility of wax in the <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> increases greatly due to SNPA addition, the solubility ratio reaches 7.5. The solubility of wax in <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> increases with increases in the concentration of SNPAs in the <b>diesel</b> <b>oil</b> and with the temperature.
