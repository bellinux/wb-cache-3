At one point in the episode, the Simpsons visit the Maasai people, a Nilotic ethnic group of semi-nomadic people located in Kenya and northern Tanzania. The way that some of the Maasai people in the episode are dancing is also true to a traditional dance performed by Maasai people in real life, and although the drinking of cow blood is faithful to the Maasai people's culture, the use of lip plates and neck rings are not. [...] "That was kind of fun for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> make this stuff [...] as crazy as the story is, [...] make it realistic", Kirkland commented on directing the episode.|$|E
500|$|Lofton {{was again}} on the move when on December 23, 2003, the New York Yankees signed him to a two-year, $6.2 million contract. During a Yankees' road game at Cleveland, Lofton {{recorded}} his 2,000th career hit. After Lofton's single, Indians fans began an ovation in honor of Lofton. [...] "I didn't know what to expect. I figured I'd get a few claps. It was touching. I tipped my hat, but they just kept going. If there was a storybook {{way for me to}} get it, to get it in Cleveland, it was something to remember." [...] New York finished the regular season with an AL-best record, 10161. To begin the post-season, the Yankees defeated the Minnesota Twins, three games to one, in the 2004 ALDS. In the 2004 ALCS against the Boston Red Sox, the Yankees had built a 20 series lead when Lofton stated, [...] "My ultimate goal is for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> win a championship. I'm at a point in my career [...] I've been here for 13 years, and gotten close. This is an opportunity for me to have a chance at it again." [...] Then Yankees would go up in the series three games to none before becoming the first team in MLB history to lose a series after holding a 30 series.|$|E

He's not even conscious of what he does, and it made him nervous for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> articulate what I was trying to do. And I sensed that immediately, so we did very little talking about it...he said, 'Shut up, I don't {{want to hear about}} it.' He didn't want me to tell him about it, you know. He wanted to make fun of it." ...|$|E

[...] “I {{never had the}} courage to consent, but now that my husband had become so famous I really thought it behooved <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> look as well as possible.” [...] Ulysses objected: “Did I not see you and fall in love with you with these same eyes? I like them just as they are, and now, remember, you are not to {{interfere}} with them. They are mine, and let me tell you, Mrs. Grant, you had better not make any experiments, as I might not like you half so well with any other eyes.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{referendum}} came to {{be known}} as Brexit, a portmanteau of [...] "British" [...] and [...] "exit". The referendum was held on 23 June 2016 and the British electorate voted by 52% to 48% in favour of leaving the European Union. On 24 June, a few hours after the results became known, Cameron announced that he would resign the office of Prime Minister by the start of the Conservative Party Conference in October 2016. In a farewell speech outside 10 Downing Street, he stated that, on account of his own advocacy on behalf of remaining in the EU, [...] "I do not think it would be right for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> be the captain that steers our country to its next destination." ...|$|E

Interested {{in animals}} and the {{outdoors}} and seeking {{a career as a}} biologist, McBain was inspired to audition for the second season after seeing the first season episode Swamp: [...] "The episode from the first season that really motivated <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> get on the show was the swamp episode. [...] "Most people would think 'Oh gross. a swamp, there's leeches and stuff.' That was the turning point for me, I was like 'I have to get on this show, that looks so fun, so many different experiences.' He was dubbed [...] "The Book Worm" [...] McBain, who admits to being an unadventurous [...] "wimp", says that he learned to trust other people and believe in himself during the show. For him, the toughest part of the series was getting through the nights and worrying about wild animal attacks.|$|E

60|$|LEE TAI. No better a {{one than}} yours, Daisy. It was a clever trick {{when you got}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> put your husband {{out of the way}} so that you should be free for George Conway.|$|E

60|$|We {{reached a}} spring at midday, and halted for a rest. I kept on pleading, and {{presently}} I discovered, to my joy, that I {{had made a}} strong impression upon Dick.

6000|$|... 'I did {{not like}} to propose it immediately,' {{continued}} Stephen. 'It seemed to me--it seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> now--like <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> catch you--a girl better in the world than I.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen, Augusta," [...] said Uncle Walter sternly. [...] "I loved a woman once. I {{believed}} she loved me.
