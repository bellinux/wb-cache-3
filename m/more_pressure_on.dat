5|$|Georgia began proposing the {{placement}} of international peacekeeping forces in the separatist regions when Russia began to apply <b>more</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> Georgia after April 2008. The West launched new initiatives for peace settlement, with peace plans being offered and conferences being organised by the European Union, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and Germany. Georgia accepted the German project for Abkhazia, but the separatists dismissed it. Russia and the separatists did not attend an EU-funded peace conference on Abkhazia. They also dismissed an OSCE offer to renew talks regarding South Ossetia.|$|E
5|$|The Bc5 may {{not seem}} {{particularly}} useful in this attack, but by eyeing e3 it {{makes it difficult for}} White to play f4 to chase away the black knight; furthermore, the attack on e3 is sometimes intensified with major pieces doubling on the e-file. Besides, the Bc5 can sometimes be recycled to the b8–h2 diagonal via Bc5–a7–b8, to apply still <b>more</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> h2. It can also stay on the a7–g1 diagonal to put pressure on f2, if White pushes e3–e4 at some stage.|$|E
5|$|With 18 minutes played, Lehmann {{became the}} first person to be sent off in a European Cup final after he brought down Samuel Eto'o outside the Arsenal box. Giuly {{subsequently}} put the ball {{in the back of the}} net, but the goal was not allowed due to the foul. Arsenal subsequently substituted Robert Pirès for Manuel Almunia, their substitute goalkeeper. The free-kick was sent wide by Ronaldinho. Following Lehmann's dismissal Barcelona began to exert <b>more</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> Arsenal, to the point where Emmanuel Eboué was cautioned for a high tackle.|$|E

5|$|Moore {{was against}} the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and {{supported}} free and accessible health insurance for all. He also wanted to transfer ownership of corporations to the workers. When discussing the War on Terror, Moore felt it was destroying small communities throughout the country with higher taxes and <b>more</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the local governments. Moore and Vice Presidential candidate Stewart Alexander supported a 50% reduction of the United States Department of Defense spending, and using the other 50% to improve veteran benefits. Alexander proposed that retired veterans with 10–30 years of military service should receive an income of $15–30 thousand annually from the state.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the restart, Liverpool had the first attack. Striker Michael Owen went past United defender Brown, but {{he was unable to}} shoot when the ball got stuck in between his feet. A minute later, Liverpool had an appeal for a penalty after striker Emile Heskey went down in the United penalty area, but referee Paul Durkin did not award a penalty. They had another chance in the 52nd minute after an exchange of passes between Murphy and Heskey, but Murphy's shot went over the bar. United began to exert <b>more</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> Liverpool after this. A minute later a shot by Keane was blocked by Liverpool defender Sami Hyypiä. The ball went out for a United, which resulted in a throw-in, that was headed into the arms of Dudek. Five minutes later, Van Nistelrooy had a chance to score as he turned and shot at the Liverpool goal, but it was saved by Dudek. Heskey was replaced by striker Milan Baroš following an injury.|$|E
5|$|Just {{after the}} start of the second half of extra time Cardiff made their final substitution, {{replacing}} McNaughton with Darcy Blake. Two minutes later Kuyt made a run from deep in the Liverpool half, his initial shot was blocked, but the ball rebounded towards him. As the ball came back to him he shot again and the ball went past Heaton and into the Cardiff goal to give Liverpool a 2–1 lead. Cardiff were struggling after the goal with a number of their players suffering from cramp. Nevertheless, they had a chance in the 111th minute, when a Gunnarsson long throw was only half-cleared by Liverpool, but they were unable to convert the chance. Towards the end of the half Cardiff began to exert <b>more</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> Liverpool. Turner, who had been moved into the striker position won a corner for Cardiff, which was punched away by Reina for a throw-in. Cardiff won another from the throw, which found Kiss, whose shot was cleared off the line of the Liverpool goal by Kuyt for another corner. The subsequent corner was headed on by Gunnarsson to Turner, who beat Kuyt to the ball and put his shot past Reina into the Liverpool goal to level the score at 2–2. Turner was shown a yellow card for removing his shirt during the celebration of the goal. Liverpool won a corner with a minute remaining but they were unable to score and the referee brought extra time to an end with the scores level, resulting in a penalty shoot-out.|$|E

While there has always been plenty of evidence of executive scepticism of staff advice, now more and more managers are able to back up their intuitive doubts with more reasoned consideration of the technical underpinnings of information they receive from experts. Not only can many executives question the conclusions of the staff man but they may also be able to delve into the technical process through which those conclusions evolved...|$|R

25|$|Similarly, a goalkeeper {{may also}} attempt to delay a penalty by {{cleaning}} his boots, asking the referee {{to see if}} the ball is placed properly and other delaying tactics.

This places <b>more</b> social <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> men to pleasure women, but <b>more</b> natural <b>pressure</b> always resides <b>on</b> women to bear and rear children.|$|R

And building assets management is specified in this paper to include all the intricate tasks in all levels of the asset life-cycle, e. g. encompassing the development of new properties, maintaining and redeveloping existing estates and strategically disposing of individual buildings...|$|R
25|$|California's {{state budget}} woes are {{expected}} to put <b>more</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> cities such as Burbank. State lawmakers have proposed eliminating the individual redevelopment agencies, {{a move that would}} force cities such as Burbank to eliminate much needed infrastructure projects. Local redevelopment agencies also may be forced to reimburse the state. For example, Burbank Redevelopment Agency might have pay the state nearly $20 million. But the city is fighting the return of at least $15 million in redevelopment funds, including money that was slated for the Lundigan Community Center and improvements to Johnny Carson Park. Whether Burbank will ultimately prevail is unclear, as the state's budget hole is getting worse due to the slow economy and lower than expected state revenues.|$|E
