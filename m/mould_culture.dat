Ion-exchange chromatography, SDS-PAGE and sensory analysis were used for comparison of P. nalgiovense with common secondary <b>mould</b> <b>culture</b> (Penicillium camemberti). RESULTS: Proteolytic activity was more intensive {{in the case of}} the strains of P. nalgiovense in comparison with the control strains of P. camemberti. Some differences in the proportion and amount of free amino acids were observed between the strains of P. nalgiovense during ripening. Lower proteolytic activity of P. nalgiovense was more desirable for sensory properties of cheese, especially in case sample N 2. CONCLUSION: This study provides information on the usability of selected strains of P. nalgiovense that could support the development of sensory properties of mould-ripened soft cheese. The cheese with the culture N 2 had the best flavour after 35 days of storage. Moreover, this strain showed the lowest bitterness in comparison with the other used P. nalgiovense cultures. The intensity of bitterness of sample N 2 was comparable to that of the control sample with P. camemberti. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{amino acid}} {{derivative}} 3, 4 -dihydroxy L-phenylalanine (L-dopa) is gaining interest {{as a drug}} of choice for Parkinson's disease. Aspergillus oryzae is commonly used for L-dopa production; however, a slower growth rate and relatively lower tyrosinase activity of mycelia have led to an increasing interest in exploiting alternative fungal cultures. In the present investigation, {{we report on the}} microbiological transformation of L-tyrosine to L-dopa accomplished by a newly isolated filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger. Results The culture A. niger (isolate GCBT- 8) was propagated in 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks and the pre-grown mycelia (48 h old) were used in the reaction mixture as a source of enzyme tyrosinase. Grinded mycelia gave 1. 26 fold higher L-dopa production compared to the intact at 6 % glucose (pH 5. 5). The rate of L-tyrosine consumption was improved from 0. 198 to 0. 281 mg/ml. Among the various nitrogen sources, 1. 5 % peptone, 1 % yeast extract and 0. 2 % ammonium chloride were optimized. The maximal L-dopa was produced (0. 365 mg/ml) at 0. 3 % potassium dihydrogen phosphate with L-tyrosine consumption of 0. 403 mg/ml.

40|$|Section 1. Acetobacter suboxydans (American Type Culture Collection No. 621) is an {{organism}} of the Pseudomonas family found in spoiled beer. Among the substances it requires for growth is p -aminobenzoic acid (p -AB), and since this substance {{is known to}} prevent the inhibition of bacterial growth by sulphonamides, the inter-relations of p -AB and a sulphonamide drug {{in the growth of}} A. suboxydans were investigated. The main approach was through a study of the variations which enabled the organism (1) to grow without p -AB and (2) to resist inhibition by sulphonamides. Such changes were likely to be associated with interesting variations in the metabolism of p -AB, since there is evidence, for instance, that in certain organisms sulphonamide resistance is due to an increased ability to synthesize p -AB. For the majority of organisms p -AB overcomes sulphonamide inhibition in a competitive manner: for a given degree of inhibition the ratio of the concentrations of p -AB an sulphonamide is constant, though the absolute amounts of these may be varied considerably. Competitive relationships of this kind suggest that both metabolite and inhibitor react with the enzyme normally using the metabolite, and that the proportion of each reacting is governed by the law of mass action. As a contrast, in non-competitive relationships, a small amount of metabolite will overcome Inhibition over a wide range of concentrations of inhibitor. It is likely that a non-competitive antagonist of an inhibitor is, or readily becomes, a product of the cell's utilisation of a competitive antagonist. As a preliminary to this study it was necessary to obtain certain information about the properties of the unchanged strain of A. suboxydans, and the following points were established: The growth of the organism was very sensitive to the air supply: optimal aeration gave optical growth. The organism was normally cultured in a medium of glycerol, casein hydrolysate, vitamins and salts (Medium 2, Appendix 2), but it grew to a limited extent in a medium in which glucose replaced glycerol. The limited growth in glucose medium was probably due to rapid acid formation from this substrate. Growth in glycerol medium was also affected by addition of glucose: at low concentrations glucose stimulated growth, but at higher levels it was inhibitory. The strain used in this laboratory would not grow satisfactorily on a synthetic medium similar to that used by Stokes & Larsen (1945). The organism required between 4 × 10 - 9 and 1. 6 × 10 - 9 M p -AB to show visible growth in Medium 2, p -AB could be replaced by synthetic pteroylglutamic acid when added at about 100 -fold greater molar concentration. Adenine replaced p -AB entirely, but not only was it required at a greater concentration than 10 - 5 M, but only a small stationary population of cells was reached in adenine cultures. The response to p -AB was affected by the amount of casein hydrolysate added to the medium, and certain amendments had to be made to the original medium as published by Landy & Dicken (1942). The effect was not due to p -AB contained as impurity in the casein hydrolysate. Both p -AB and pteroylglutamic acid overcame sulphonamide inhibition of growth in a competitive manner. With 10 - 7 M p -AB the organism was able to resist between 10 - 4 and 2 × 10 - 4 M sulphathiazole. Adenine, however, acted non-competitively, permitting growth in all concentrations of drug up to 2 × 10 - 3 M. A synergism between pteroylglutamic acid and a mixture due to Lampen, Roepke & Jones (1946) of purines, methionine and thymine was traced to the adenine in the mixture. Extracts of the organism were prepared which replaced folic acid for Lactobacillus casei and adenine for an "adenine-less" mutant of Neurospora crassa. The folic acid content of cells of A. suboxydans was independent of their age and of the amount of p -AB in which they were grown. Extracts of the kind mentioned above were used for comparison of the quantitative properties of the variant strains described below. "Sub-strains" of A. suboxydans 621 were obtained trained to dispense with p -AB (strain A) and to resist some 200 times the normal amount of sulphathiazole for a given amount of p -AB (strain C). Throughout this work sulphathiazole was used as the sulphonamide type drug in preference to sulphanilamide amide as the latter is known to effect the CO 2 enzymes of cells in a manner not shown by its analogues. The sulphathiazole-resistant strain, strain C, was shown to have undergone no change in its requirement for p -AB in its normal medium. That is to say that it required the same amount of p -AB to give visible growth after a fixed time as did the parent strain, though its medium contained 2 × 10 - 3 M sulphathiazole. Its growth curve in a medium containing this amount of sulphathiazole and 10 - 7 M p -AB was {{similar to that of the}} parent strain growing in the same conditions but without sulphathiazole. On the other hand, strain C could grow in the absence of added p -AB if sulphathiazole were also omitted; the extent of growth was then limited. The relationship between p -AB and sulphathiazole in strain C was still competitive; there had merely been a change in the molar ratio of these two substances required to cause inhibition. The strain did not destroy sulphathiazole. The non-exacting strain, strain A, grew without added p -AB, but still resembled the parent organism in that it required nicotinic and pantothenic acids for growth. It had an increased resistance to sulphathiazole compared with the parent organism when both were tested with 10 - 7 M p -AB, though this resistance was not as great as that of strain C. The relationship between p -AB and sulphathiazole was also competitive in this strain. The growth of strain A was affected by the amount of "vitamin-free" casein hydrolysate provided in its medium: growth in Medium 2 was limited compared with the other strains. In this medium its extent of growth was increased by: p -AB Pteroylglutamic acid at some 100 times the molar concentration at which p -AB was active. High concentrations of aspartic acid. Glucose at some concentrations. Increased amounts of vitamin-free casein hydrolysate. This last effect was not shown, however, by a second strain of this type called strain A 2. The stimulation of growth by casein hydrolysate was not due to the presence of p -AB in this material. Many pure vitamins, amino-acids and other compounds of importance in general cell metabolism were tested for ability to stimulate the growth of strain A; only those mentioned above were active. Other strains. An unsuccessful attempt was made to train strain A to resist sulphathiazole further by serial subculture in partially inhibitory concentrations of drug. Similarly, an attempt was made to reduce to zero the p -AB requirement of strain C in the presence of its normal concentration of sulphathiazole (2 × 10 - 3 M). This was also unsuccessful, though a peculiar strain (strain CD) was obtained after prolonged subculture with suboptimal amounts of p -AB. The possible synthesis of p -AB, folic acid and adenine by the trained and normal strains of A. suboxydans was investigated. Attempts to detect synthesis of p -AB by strains A and C were made by ether extraction of cultures grown without this growth factor. The extracts were concentrated and assayed with a strain of normal A. suboxydans trained to grow in the presence of the extracts. Ho synthesis of p -AB was detected. Synthesis of folic acid did occur with strain C, and the folic acid content of cells of this strain (assayed with Lb. casei) was the same as the content of cells of the parent strain. This was true of cells grown both with and without sulphathiazole. The folic acid content of cells of strain A was very much diminished compared with the other two strains. It is unlikely that any of the strains of A. suboxydans synthesised the pteroylglutamic acid molecule as such, because the shapes of the assay curves with Lb. casei using bacterial extracts were different from the control curves obtained with a sample of pteroylglutamic acid. Assays of whole cultures of A. suboxydans with Lb. casei were complicated by the presence of an inhibitor of Lb. casei in the assay material, and no conclusive results were obtained. Synthesis of adenine occurred in strains A and C as well as in the parent strain; it was detected by assay with an "adenine-less" mutant of N. crassa. The adenine content of cells of all three strains was similar, and its presence probably accounted for the non-competitive anti-sulphathiazole activity of cell extracts for the normal strain. Comparisons with Escherichia coli 273 - 384. This was a mutant of Esch. coli requiring p -AB for growth, and some variant strains analogous to A and C in A. suboxydans were isolated and investigated. The organism was readily trained to grow in the absence of vitamin and the resulting variant grew to the same extent as its parent growing optimally and its growth was not stimulated by p -AB. Its resistance to sulphathiazole was the same as that of its parent when both were tested with 10 - 7 M p -AB. A strain was obtained having a sulphathiazole resistance increased by about 50 -fold for a given amount of p -AB, but its resistance was not successfully increased further. In the absence of sulphathiazole it still required p -AB for growth (unlike strain C of A. suboxydans), and in the presence of drug its requirement for p -AB was considerable. The training was in a sense incomplete, since the growth rate of the resistant organism was less than that of the parent strain even after many subcultures in the training medium. Discussion. The results outlined above were discussed in an attempt to understand further the mechanisms of the variations. that had taken place in A. suboxydans. It was considered to be unlikely that either strain had developed an ability to synthesise p -AB, though the possibility that extremely small amounts were synthesised could not be eliminated entirely. Strain A was regarded as having developed a mode of growth independent of this vitamin, and probably also of folic acid; its growth was probably dependent on the supply of amino-acids. The view was taken that, while strain C may possibly have undergone a change of the same type as that undergone by strain A, this was not the change responsible for its high sulphathiazole resistance. The primary change was considered to be a quantitative expansion of p -AB-utilising enzyme in the cell, at the surface of which p -AB and sulphonamides can be regarded as competing. An increase in affinity of the enzyme for p -AB as compared with sulphathiazole would also account for the experimental data. The point was made that further York on the rates of utilisation of p -AB, or rates of formation of products from p -AB, would be of interest. A brief mathematical consideration of this view was given to show that a roughly 80 -fold expansion of p -AB-utilising enzyme would account for the 200 -fold increase in sulphathiazole resistance observed. Section 2. Concurrently with the work on the variations of A. suboxydans some experiments were undertaken on the interactions of artificially induced mutants requiring p -AB for growth. In view of the results of other workers on induced mutants it is likely that mutations resulting in a growth factor requirement are due to damage to one stage in a sequence of biochemical reactions leading normally to the synthesis of the factor required. This may be represented: A → B → C → D → E → F [...] . → metabolite. In various organisms with a similar requirement these interruptions may well be at different stages in the sequence, and, as Beadle (1945) and his co-workers have shown with N. crassa, a mutant damaged, for example, between A and B will sometimes respond to extracts if one damaged between C and D, since C may accumulate in cultures of the latter. Ten mutant organisms requiring p -AB for growth were obtained from other laboratories and tested with this possibility in view, and interactions between the mould Ophiostoma multiannulatum 617 and two mutants of Esch. coli were recorded. Interactions between two mutants of N. crassa and A. suboxydans were shown to be due to formation of glucose by N. crassa from sucrose provided in its medium. This was formed at concentrations which stimulated the growth of A. suboxydans when fluid from a grown <b>mould</b> <b>culture</b> was added to its medium. </p...|$|E
30|$|The {{methods of}} {{cultivation}} greatly influence {{the production and}} properties of the enzyme. The most common methods of production involve either solid state (SSF) or submerged fermentation (SmF). Traditionally, GGH has been produced by the later processes as enzyme production was about 5 fold higher than with the former (Pandey et al. 2000). The conditions of fermentation such as growth period, temperature, pH, agitation and aeration and medium composition greatly affect the enzyme production under SmF. In SmF, the morphology of filamentous microorganisms varies between two extreme forms, pellets and free filaments, depending on culture conditions and the genotype of the strain. According to previous reports, mycelial morphology {{is crucial to the}} process of fermentation, not only in relation to the shape of the hyphae themselves and the aggregation into microscopic clumps (micro-morphology), but also in the pelleted form of growth (macro-morphology). However, reports on the preferred morphology are often contradictory since each one of the two extreme forms - pellets vs. filaments - has their own characteristics concerning cell physiology, growth kinetics, nutrient consumption and broth rheology, which can be regarded either as advantages or as drawbacks (Clementi and Rossi 1986; Papagianni 2004). The present study is concerned with screening of <b>mould</b> <b>cultures,</b> isolated from soil, for the production and optimization of cultural conditions for GGH being carried out aseptically from the selected species and their morphological changes. The 2 -factorial Plackett-Burman experimental design was used to further identify the significant batch culture conditions influencing enzyme productivity.|$|R
30|$|Sixteen {{different}} <b>mould</b> <b>cultures</b> viz. Aspergillus, Alternaria, Arthroderma, Trichoderma, Fusarium, Penicillium, Rhizopus and Chochliobolus {{were isolated}} from the soil samples of Qatar by serial dilution method. The preliminary screening of isolates was done by selecting initial colonies showing relatively bigger zones of starch hydrolysis on nutrient agar plates. The isolates were then subjected to secondary screening by submerged fermentation (SmF). The 1, 4 -α-D-glucan glucohydrolase (GGH) activity ranged from 1.906 - 12.675 U/ml/min. The product yield was analysed in dependence of mycelial morphology, biomass level and protein content. The isolate Aspergillus oryzae llB- 6 which gave maximum enzyme production was incubated in M 3 medium containing 20 g/l starch, 10 g/l lactose, 8.5 g/l yeast extract, 6 g/l corn steep liquor (CSL), 1.2 g/l MgSO 4.7 H 2 O, 1.3 g/l NH 4 Cl, 0.6 g/l CaCl 2.2 H 2 O, pH 5 at 30 ± 2 °C and 200 rpm. On the basis of kinetic variables, notably Qp (0.058 ± 0.01 a U/g/h), Yp/s (0.308 ± 0.03 ab U/g) and qp (0.210 ± 0.032 abc U/g fungal biomass/h), A. oryzae IIB- 6 {{was found to be}} a hyper producer of GGH (LSD 0.0345) compared to A. kawachii IIB- 2. A noticeable enhancement in enzyme activity of over 30 % was observed (13.917 ± 1.01 U/ml/min) when the process parameters viz. cultural conditions (pH 5, incubation period 72 h) and nutritional requirements (6 g/l CSL, 9.5 g/l yeast extract, 10 g/l starch, 20 g/l lactose) were further optimized using a 2 -factorial Plackett-Burman design. The model terms were found to be highly significant (HS, p≤ 0.05), indicating the potential utility of the culture (dof~ 3).|$|R
40|$|From data {{it seems}} that the {{presence}} of OTA on surface of sausages does not represent a food health risk for human, considering that OTA was not identified inside in the dry meat. In particular after washing the surface of the sausages, no OTA was detected on the casings. So to limit any accidental contamination of the meat of the sausages, it was suggested to wash the casings before packaging or slicing. However the control of the temperature and the Relative Humidity during sausages production and the choice of a protective <b>moulds</b> starter <b>cultures</b> (Leistner, 1986; Comi et al., 2004), are the best methods to limit the presence and the growth of toxigenic moulds on the surface of dry sausages...|$|R
50|$|The role of schreckstoff in immune {{response}} was further {{strengthened by the}} finding that skin extracts from fathead minnows inhibited the growth of Saprolegnia ferax (a water <b>mould)</b> in <b>culture.</b> In contrast, skin extracts from swordtails (Xiphophorus helleri), which are not believed to produce schreckstoff, increased S. ferax growth compared to controls. Cadmium, a heavy metal and an immunosuppressant in vertebrates, inhibits the production of alarm cells when fishes are infected with Saprolegnia. Furthermore, a follow-up study treated fathead minnows with cortisol, a well-known immunosuppressant, which significantly reduced alarm cell investment in conjunction with leukocyte activity. The results of these extensive studies strongly suggest schreckstoff’s main function is to provide immunity against a number of environmental threats aimed at the fish’s epidermis.|$|R

40|$|Sufu is a {{fermented}} cheese-like soybean {{product in}} China and Vietnam, obtained by fungal solid-state fermentation of soybean curd (tofu), {{which results in}} moulded tofu or 'pehtze'. The final product sufu is obtained by maturing pehtze in a brine containing alcohol and salt {{during a period of}} several months. The present report deals with the identity and phylogenetic relationships of <b>mould</b> starter <b>cultures</b> used for the preparation of pehtze. Starter cultures used in commercial pehtze fermentation were obtained from factories located in several provinces of China and Vietnam, isolated from their pehtze and some were obtained from culture collections. They were identified as Actinomucor repens, Actinomucor taiwanensis, Mucor circinelloides, Mocur hiemalis, Mocur racemosus, and Rhizopus microsporus var. microsporus. Phylogenetic relations based on sequencing of genomic DNA of these starters and of relevant control strains from collections indicate that the genera Mucor, Actinomucor and Rhizopus form distinct and homogenous clusters, with Mucor and Actinomucor showing a slightly closer relationship with each other than with Rhizopus...|$|R
40|$|Antimicrobal {{drugs are}} {{chemotherapeutics}} {{with a wide}} spectrum of use in human and veterinary medicine and livestock practice. Beta-lactams are the most widespread group of antimicrobal drugs and are most often used in human and veterinary medicine in the treatment of bacterial infections due to their powerful antimicrobial activity and very low toxicity. They are divided into the groups of penicillins, cefalosporins and monobactams. Penicillins are obtained from the filtrate of the <b>mould</b> <b>cultures</b> Penicillium notatum and Penicillium chrysogenum, while cefalosporins are obtained from the filtrate of the actinomycete cultures (Cephalosporium acremonium). Research has lead to the discovery of active groups of 6 -amino-penicillin acids, whose isolation has made it possible to produce semi-synthetic penicillins that have surpassed the limitations of natural penicillin G. The physico-chemical properties of the beta-lactams can be altered by substituting hydrogen in the carboxyl group of penicillins, i. e. in modifying the side chain of cefalosporin. This increases the resistance to the activity of β-lactamase and expands the spectrum of activity. Beta-lactams, in therapy concentrations, act as a bacteriocide by inhibiting the synthesis of bacterial cell walls. Penicillins are important for antibacterial chemotherapy, often in combination with other antimicrobal drugs. Cefalosporins are usually used as a replacement for penicillin in treating infections caused by gram-negative bacteria and in prophylaxis for surgery. The use of beta-lactams in animals used for food can result in the residues of these drugs in meat and meat products or milk and eggs. The introduction of antimicrobal drugs in the human body via food is particularly dangerous due to their direct toxicity or carcinogenicity, influences on the composition of the intestinal microflora, possible allergic reactions in sensitive people, and the appearance of resistance of individual pathogenic microorganisms, and therefore their determination is necessary. Considering that they are widely used in the treatment of mastitis, they are the most commonly determined antimicrobal drugs in milk. For the purpose of determining the residues of beta-lactams in food of animal origin, microbiological screening methods are used, and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry is most often used for identification and quantification...|$|R
40|$|Three {{batches of}} dry {{fermented}} sausages were prepared. A {{proportion of the}} products from each batch were surface-treated with a <b>mould</b> starter <b>culture,</b> with the remaining products being smoked without mould. Physico-chemical analysis, including {{determination of the content}} of lactic acid and biogenic amines, was performed on day 35 during the ripening and on the final products (day 65). The sausages with surface mould showed a higher pH value, a higher water activity value and a lower content of D/L-lactic acid. The differences were statistically significant (P ≤ 0. 001). A higher content of malondialdehyde (TBARS) was found in products with mould, though the differences determined were not statistically significant. From day 35, statistically significant differences were found in the content of biogenic amines (BA). The highest content was recorded on day 65 in sausages with surface mould, with a content seven times that of the content in the mix immediately after being filled in the casing being recorded. In no case did the sum level of BA exceed 100 mg kg- 1...|$|R

50|$|Spain {{provided}} an equally telling example of Italian cultural admiration in the 18th century. The {{installation of a}} team of Italian architects and artists, headed by Filippo Juvarra, has been interpreted as part of Queen Elisabeth Farnese's conscious policy to <b>mould</b> the visual <b>culture</b> of the Spanish court along Italian lines. The engagement of Corrado Giaquinto from Molfetta and eventually the Venetian Jacopo Amigoni as the creators of the painted decorative space for the new seat of the Spanish court was a clear indication of this aesthetic orientation, while the later employment of Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and his son Giovanni Domenico confirmed the Italophile tendency.|$|R

40|$|Geography {{and history}} are interrelated {{and they are}} {{contributory}} to each other. Geography influences the historical events. Geography <b>moulds</b> our <b>culture,</b> mind and history. We have seen how geography {{played an important role}} in the formation of Indian history. Geography includes the land, water, climate, mountains and other features, which are essentially utilized by the human beings to form the state, polity, economy, society, culture, religion etc. Hence, it is proved beyond that geography is a tool to reconstruct the history of any country. During the 16 th to 18 th centuries we see many Nayaks, Paleyagars, Nadaprabhus and other chieftains who established their chiefdoms or the Paleyapattus. For their activities geography helped them a lot. Because most of the Paleyapattus were very small and tiny principalities, but still these Paleyagars and Nayaks were able to sustain their rule due to the fact that the places where they have established their rule were situated at strategic places. It is quite interesting to go into the deep study of geography and its place in the formation of the fragmented polity during the above mentioned period...|$|R
40|$|A 24 {{year old}} man {{developed}} severe asthma {{two years after}} starting {{to work in a}} plywood plant. Four years later the patient had to stop working because of the increasing severity of his asthma. Three months after leaving his job, the patient's asthma was greatly improved. His job consisted of placing plywood sheets into a drying machine. The plywood sheets had stayed outside in wet conditions for at least four to six weeks and were usually covered with moulds. Drying the plywood sheets changed the mould into a fine orange powder. Exposure to this in the laboratory induced an isolated immediate asthmatic reaction. The same reaction was seen when the patient was challenged with an extract of the mould powder at a 0. 1 % w/v concentration. Skin prick test with the mould extract induced a weal and flare reaction and IgE antibodies against the dry mould powder were identified. A control patient with the same degree of bronchial hyperreactivity did not have any asthmatic reaction when challenged with the same <b>mould</b> extract. <b>Culture</b> of the dry mould powder on Sabouraud agar plates grew pure Neurospora sp.
