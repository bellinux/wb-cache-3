5|$|The section {{summarizes}} {{the concepts of}} population genetics, a branch of evolutionary theory combining <b>Mendelian</b> <b>genetics</b> and natural selection in mathematical form to explain the pressures on animal societies.

5|$|Aristotle's {{theory has}} some symmetry, as semen {{movements}} carry maleness while the menses carry femaleness. If the semen is {{hot enough to}} overpower the cold menses, the child will be a boy; {{but if it is}} too cold to do this, the child will be a girl. Inheritance is thus particulate (definitely one trait or another), as in <b>Mendelian</b> <b>genetics,</b> unlike the Hippocratic model which was continuous and blending.|$|E

5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{will only}} cause evolution {{if there is}} enough genetic variation in a population. Before the discovery of <b>Mendelian</b> <b>genetics,</b> one common hypothesis was blending inheritance. But with blending inheritance, genetic variance would be rapidly lost, making evolution by natural selection implausible. The Hardy–Weinberg principle provides the solution to how variation is maintained in a population with Mendelian inheritance. The frequencies of alleles (variations in a gene) will remain constant {{in the absence of}} selection, mutation, migration and genetic drift.|$|E
5|$|Hugo de Vries {{tried to}} link the new {{genetics}} with evolution; building on his work with heredity and hybridization, he proposed a theory of mutationism, which was widely accepted in the early 20th century. Lamarckism also had many adherents. Darwinism was seen as incompatible with the continuously variable traits studied by biometricians, which seemed only partially heritable. In the 1920s and 1930s—following {{the acceptance of the}} Mendelian-chromosome theory— the emergence of the discipline of population genetics, with the work of R.A. Fisher, J.B.S. Haldane and Sewall Wright, unified the idea of evolution by natural selection with <b>Mendelian</b> <b>genetics,</b> producing the modern synthesis. The inheritance of acquired characters was rejected, while mutationism gave way as genetic theories matured.|$|E
5|$|The American {{biologist}} Sewall Wright, who had {{a background}} in animal breeding experiments, focused on combinations of interacting genes, {{and the effects of}} inbreeding on small, relatively isolated populations that exhibited genetic drift. In 1932, Wright introduced the concept of an adaptive landscape and argued that genetic drift and inbreeding could drive a small, isolated sub-population away from an adaptive peak, allowing natural selection to drive it towards different adaptive peaks. The work of Fisher, Haldane and Wright founded the discipline of population genetics. This integrated natural selection with <b>Mendelian</b> <b>genetics,</b> which was the critical first step in developing a unified theory of how evolution worked.|$|E

A program proposal – International and national context Genomics and proteomics have the tendency to become – along with the nanotechnologies and computation intelligence – the principal progress vectors of this century. After having brought a small revolution in agriculture and zoo-technology based on the <b>Mendelian</b> discoveries, <b>genetics</b> became somewhat slower in its progress, until the discovery of DNA. It has been the huge effort of the Human Genome Project which visionary projected, in the 1990, genomics as the leading science and technology for our century.

For example, research laboratories often maintain educational outreach projects aimed at translating their science into something meaningful for the general public, often K-12 students, as an effort to increase research broader impacts required by funding agencies such as the NSF. These may include activities using fast-growing plants that exhibit distinctive mutants with unique phenotypes useful to teach K-12 students about both <b>Mendelian</b> and molecular <b>genetics.</b> Some institutions and organizations maintain large or small aggregations of their activity resources, outreach programs, upcoming events calendars, and partnering programs.|$|R
5|$|When Thomas Hunt Morgan began {{experimenting with}} {{breeding}} the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, {{he was a}} saltationist who hoped to demonstrate that a new species could be created in the lab by mutation alone. Instead, the work at his lab between 1910 and 1915 reconfirmed <b>Mendelian</b> <b>genetics</b> and provided solid experimental evidence linking it to chromosomal inheritance. His work also demonstrated that most mutations had relatively small effects, such as a change in eye color, and that rather than creating a new species in a single step, mutations served to increase variation within the existing population.|$|E
5|$|When {{there are}} few copies of an allele, the effect of genetic drift is larger, and when there are many copies the effect is smaller. In the early 20th century, {{vigorous}} debates occurred over {{the relative importance of}} natural selection versus neutral processes, including genetic drift. Ronald Fisher, who explained natural selection using <b>Mendelian</b> <b>genetics,</b> held the view that genetic drift plays at the most a minor role in evolution, and this remained the dominant view for several decades. In 1968, population geneticist Motoo Kimura rekindled the debate with his neutral theory of molecular evolution, which claims that most instances where a genetic change spreads across a population (although not necessarily changes in phenotypes) are caused by genetic drift acting on neutral mutations.|$|E
5|$|The {{rediscovery of}} Gregor Mendel's laws of {{inheritance}} in 1900 ignited a fierce debate between two camps of biologists. In one camp were the Mendelians, who {{were focused on}} discrete variations {{and the laws of}} inheritance. They were led by William Bateson (who coined the word genetics) and Hugo de Vries (who coined the word mutation). Their opponents were the biometricians, who were interested in the continuous variation of characteristics within populations. Their leaders, Karl Pearson and Walter Frank Raphael Weldon, followed in the tradition of Francis Galton, who had focused on measurement and statistical analysis of variation within a population. The biometricians rejected <b>Mendelian</b> <b>genetics</b> on the basis that discrete units of heredity, such as genes, could not explain the continuous range of variation seen in real populations. Weldon's work with crabs and snails provided evidence that selection pressure from the environment could shift the range of variation in wild populations, but the Mendelians maintained that the variations measured by biometricians were too insignificant to account for the evolution of new species.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Epigenetics has rapidly {{evolved in}} the past decade to form an {{exciting}} new branch of biology. In modern terms, 'epigenetics' studies molecular pathways regulating how the genes are packaged in the chromosome and expressed, with effects that are heritable between cell divisions and even across generations. CONTEXT: Epigenetic mechanisms often conflict with <b>Mendelian</b> models of <b>genetics,</b> and many components of the epigenetic systems in plants appeared anomalous. However, {{it is now clear that}} these systems govern how the entire genome operates and evolves. SCOPE: In the first part of a two-part review, how epigenetic systems in plants were elucidated is addressed. Also there is a discussion on how the different components of the epigenetic system [...] regulating DNA methylation, histones and their post-translational modification, and pathways recognizing aberrant transcripts [...] may work together...|$|R
5000|$|Yule's first {{paper on}} {{statistics}} appeared in 1895: [...] "On the Correlation of Total Pauperism with Proportion of Out-relief". Yule {{was interested in}} applying statistical techniques to social problems and he quickly {{became a member of}} the Royal Statistical Society. For many years the only members interested in mathematical statistics were Yule, Edgeworth and Bowley. In 1897-99 Yule wrote important papers on correlation and regression); after 1900 he worked on a parallel theory of association. His approach to association was quite different from Pearson's and relations between them deteriorated. Yule had broad interests and his collaborators included the agricultural meteorologist R. H. Hooker, the medical statistician Major Greenwood and the agricultural scientist Sir Frank Engledow. Yule's sympathy towards the newly rediscovered <b>Mendelian</b> theory of <b>genetics</b> led to several papers.|$|R
40|$|The {{genomics}} {{revolution has}} raised more questions than it has provided answers. Big data from large population-scale resequencing studies are increasingly deconstructing classic notions of <b>Mendelian</b> disease <b>genetics,</b> which support a simplistic correlation between mutational severity and phenotypic outcome. The boundaries are being blurred as the body of evidence showing monogenic disease-causing alleles in healthy genomes, and in the genomes of individuals with increased common complex disease risk, continues to grow. In this review, {{we focus on the}} newly emerging challenges which pertain to the interpretation of sequence variants in genes implicated in the pathogenesis of maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY), a presumed monogenic form of diabetes characterized by Mendelian inheritance. These challenges highlight the complexities surrounding the assignments of pathogenicity, in particular to rare protein-alerting variants, and bring to the forefront some profound clinical diagnostic implications. As MODY is both genetically and clinically heterogeneous, an accurate molecular diagnosis and cautious extrapolation of sequence data are critical to effective disease management and treatment. The biological and translational value of sequence information can only be attained by adopting a multitude of confirmatory analyses, which interrogate variant implication in disease from every possible angle. Indeed, studies which have effectively detected rare damaging variants in known MODY genes in normoglycemic individuals question the existence of a single gene mutation scenario: does monogenic diabetes exist when the genetic culprits of MODY have been systematically identified in individuals without MODY...|$|R

25|$|The 19th century {{ideas of}} natural {{selection}} by Darwin and <b>Mendelian</b> <b>genetics</b> were put together with population genetics, early in the twentieth century. The modern synthesis also addressed {{the relationship between the}} broad-scale changes of macroevolution seen by palaeontologists and the small-scale microevolution of local populations of living organisms. The synthesis was defined differently by its founders, with Ernst Mayr in 1959, G. Ledyard Stebbins in 1966 and Theodosius Dobzhansky in 1974 offering differing numbers of basic postulates in their definitions, though they all included natural selection, working on heritable variation supplied by mutation. Other major figures in the synthesis included E. B. Ford, Bernhard Rensch, Ivan Schmalhausen, and George Gaylord Simpson. An early event in the modern synthesis was R. A. Fisher's 1918 paper on mathematical population genetics, but William Bateson, and separately Udny Yule, were already starting to show how <b>Mendelian</b> <b>genetics</b> could work in evolution in 1902.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} century, genetic {{improvement}} of crops, combined with modern agronomic practices, has underpinned massive increases in yield and food production. This enabled continued exponential {{growth of the}} global human population and increased per capita wealth, resulting in {{a higher proportion of}} calorific intake from energy-inefficient heterotrophic livestock. However, most of these gains from the ‘Green Revolution’ were achieved in a period of relative climate stability, compared with the ongoing period of increased climate change and variability. Crop breeding has increasingly become an interdisciplinary exercise in managing complexity. The success of modern plant breeding programs has been based on careful selection, inbreeding, and hybridisation, informed by a framework of <b>Mendelian</b> and quantitative <b>genetics.</b> Recent advances making use of whole genome sequence and marker systems are increasingly based on understanding the ensemble contribution of the genome combined with reductionist approaches to increase the predictability of breeding designs and decisions.

40|$|The Greater Middle East (GME) {{has been}} a central hub of human {{migration}} and population admixture. The tradition of consanguinity, variably practiced in the Persian Gulf region, North Africa, and Central Asia 1 - 3, has resulted in an elevated burden of recessive disease 4. Here we generated a whole-exome GME variome from 1, 111 unrelated subjects. We detected substantial diversity and admixture in continental and subregional populations, corresponding to several ancient founder populations with little evidence of bottlenecks. Measured consanguinity rates were {{an order of magnitude}} above those in other sampled populations, and the GME population exhibited an increased burden of runs of homozygosity (ROHs) but showed no evidence for reduced burden of deleterious variation due to classically theorized ‘genetic purging’. Applying this database to unsolved recessive conditions in the GME population reduced the number of potential disease-causing variants by four- to sevenfold. These results show variegated genetic architecture in GME populations and support future human genetic discoveries in <b>Mendelian</b> and population <b>genetics...</b>|$|R
40|$|Mathematical {{modeling}} can ground {{communication and}} reciprocal enrichment among {{fields of knowledge}} whose domains are very different. We propose a new mathematical model applicable in biology, specified into ecology and evolutionary biology, and in cultural transmission studies, considered as a branch of economics. Main inspiration for the model are some biological concepts we call “eco-phenotypic” such as development, plasticity, reaction norm, phenotypic heritability, epigenetics, and niche construction. “Physiology” is a core concept we introduce and translate differently in the biological and cultural domains. The model is ecological in that it aims at describing and studying organisms and populations that perform living, intended as a thermodynamic, matter-energy process concerning resources gathering, usage, and depletion in a spatiotemporal context with given characteristics, {{as well as with}} multiplication and space occupation. The model also supports evolution, intended as a dynamics including cumulative change in the features of unique organisms that are connected into breeding populations. The model is then applicable to the economics of cultural transmission in which individuals form their attitudes and patterns of behavior under a complex system of influences derived from their “cultural parents”, other members of the society, and the environment. On the side of biology, an innovative goal is to integrate in a single model all the eco-phenotypic concepts as well as both evolution and ecology. On the side of cultural transmission, eco-phenotypic modeling seems more appropriate in capturing some aspects of cultural systems which are modeled away in the earlier framework based on <b>Mendelian</b> population <b>genetics...</b>|$|R

25|$|Thomas Hunt Morgan {{began his}} career in {{genetics}} as a saltationist, and started out trying to demonstrate that mutations could produce new species in fruit flies. However, the experimental work at his lab with the common fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, which helped establish the link between <b>Mendelian</b> <b>genetics</b> and the chromosomal theory of inheritance, demonstrated that rather than creating new species in a single step, mutations increased the genetic variation in the population. By 1912, after years of work on the genetics of fruit flies, Thomas Hunt Morgan showed that these insects had many small Mendelian factors (discovered as mutant flies) on which Darwinian evolution could work as if variation was fully continuous. The way was open for geneticists to conclude that Mendelism supported Darwinism.|$|E
25|$|Understanding of mutationism is {{clouded by}} the mid-20th century {{portrayal}} of the early mutationists by supporters of the modern synthesis as opponents of Darwinian evolution and rivals of the biometrics school who argued that selection operated on continuous variation. In this portrayal, mutationism was defeated by a synthesis of genetics and natural selection that supposedly started later, around 1918, with work by the mathematician Ronald Fisher. However, the alignment of <b>Mendelian</b> <b>genetics</b> and natural selection began as early as 1902 with a paper by Udny Yule, and built up with theoretical and experimental work in Europe and America. Despite the controversy, the early mutationists had by 1918 already accepted natural selection and explained continuous variation {{as the result of}} multiple genes acting on the same characteristic, such as height.|$|E
40|$|Steroidogenic acute {{regulatory}} protein (StAR) D 4 {{is a member}} of the StAR related lipid transfer family. Homology comes from the ∼ 210 amino acid lipid binding domain implicated in intracellular transport, cell signaling, and lipid metabolism.

Homozygous knockout mice exhibited normal <b>Mendelian</b> mating <b>genetics,</b> but weighed less than wild-type littermates, an effect not accounted for by energy metabolism or food intake.

No significant alterations in plasma or liver lipid content were observed on a chow diet, but female knockout mice showed a decrease in gallbladder bile cholesterol and phospholipid concentration. When challenged with a 0. 2 % lova­statin diet, StARD 4 homozygous mice exhibited no changes. However, when challenged with a 0. 5 % cholesterol diet, female StARD 4 homozygous mice showed a moderate decrease in total cholesterol, LDL, and cholesterol ester concentrations. Microarray analysis of liver RNA found few changes. However, NPC 1 ’s expression, a gene not on the microarray, was decreased ∼ 2. 5 -fold in knockouts.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Autosomal {{recessive}} hypercholesterolemia {{is a rare}} inherited disorder, {{characterized by}} extremely high total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, that has been previously linked to mutations in LDLRAP 1. We identified a family with autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia not explained by mutations in LDLRAP 1 or other genes known to cause monogenic hypercholesterolemia. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify the molecular pathogenesis of autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia in this family. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We used exome sequencing to assess all protein-coding regions of the genome in 3 family members and identified a homozygous exon 8 splice junction mutation (c. 894 G>A, also known as E 8 SJM) in LIPA that segregated with the diagnosis of hypercholesterolemia. Because homozygosity for mutations in LIPA is known to cause cholesterol ester storage disease, we performed directed follow-up phenotyping by noninvasively measuring hepatic cholesterol content. We observed abnormal hepatic accumulation of cholesterol in the homozygote individuals, supporting the diagnosis of cholesterol ester storage disease. Given previous suggestions of cardiovascular disease risk in heterozygous LIPA mutation carriers, we genotyped E 8 SJM in > 27 000 individuals and found no association with plasma lipid levels or risk of myocardial infarction, confirming a true recessive mode of inheritance.

25|$|Morgan was a {{supporter}} of de Vries's mutation theory and was hoping to gather evidence {{in favor of it}} when he started working with the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster in his lab in 1907. However, it was a researcher in that lab, Hermann Joseph Muller, who determined in 1918 that the new varieties de Vries had observed while breeding Oenothera were the result of polyploid hybrids rather than rapid genetic mutation. While they were doubtful of the importance of natural selection, the work of geneticists like Morgan, Bateson, de Vries and others from 1900 to 1915 established <b>Mendelian</b> <b>genetics</b> linked to chromosomal inheritance, which validated August Weismann's criticism of neo-Lamarckian evolution by discounting the inheritance of acquired characteristics.

Even taking into consideration possible errors in the model, this reasonably excluded the stochastic process of genetic drift, because the changes were too fast. Haldane's statistical analysis of selection for the melanic variant in peppered moths became a well known part of his effort to demonstrate that mathematical models that combined natural selection with <b>Mendelian</b> <b>genetics</b> could explain evolution — an effort that played a key role in the foundation of the discipline of population genetics, and the beginnings of the modern synthesis of evolutionary theory with genetics.|$|E

40|$|Molecular biology, {{combined}} with <b>Mendelian</b> and quantitative <b>genetics</b> in {{quantitative trait locus}} (QTL) mapping and marker-assisted selection (MAS), provides powerful new tools to facilitate efficient genetic manipulation by plant breeders of complex traits such as drought tolerance and phosphorus (P) acquisition ability. This paper examines current opportunities for genetically manipulating the ability of crop plants to more efficiently acquire (i. e. access and take up) essential soil nutrients, using as examples P {{and several of the}} crops in the genetic improvement mandate of the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) – chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.), pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.)

It is concluded that for at least some of these important, but often academically and economically orphaned tropical food, forage and feed-grain crops, the genetic variation and molecular tools that we will need already exist or can be expected to become available in the very near future. With appropriate, targeted research, these tools can permit empirical exploration of the potential for marker-facilitated mapping and manipulation of major genes that can contribute to enhanced ability of these crops to acquire P from sources with limited availability. With these tools, delivery of new versions of currently popular high-yielding, high quality, disease resistant crop cultivars, having genetically improved ability to acquire P currently in soils but unavailable for crop growth, could take as little as five to seven years. Sustainable use of such improved cultivars would require their utilization as components of integrated soil fertility management systems...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{limitations}} for aquaculture development in developing countries is the limited availability of trained personnel {{in the areas of}} genetics and statistics. Technical staff involved in aquaculture often have little or no training in quantitative genetics and applied statistics to conduct well designed breeding programs for aquatic animal species. As a result there have been very few genetically improved strains of fish or crustaceans developed and used for aquaculture. In response to the prevailing situation the WorldFish Center has placed a strong emphasis on the enhancement of research capacity and training of national scientists in the area of fish breeding and genetics. Annually we run at least one course in quantitative genetics and its application to genetic resource management. Almost all participants come from National Aquaculture Research Institutions in different countries. Overall, the main aim of our courses is providing students with basic principles in quantitative genetics applied to performance improvement for aquatic animal species. Advanced courses are sometimes organised upon request from partner countries or due to a need for the implementation of projects activities. Areas of genetics covered in our courses include basic <b>Mendelian</b> and population <b>genetics,</b> quantitative genetics, and application of molecular information and reproductive technologies to practical breeding programs. In particular, we focus on aspects of quantitative genetics applied to fish improvement. Topics normally covered in-depth include strain collection and evaluation, establishment of the foundation population, design and implementation of the selection program, effective population size and control of inbreeding, selection index, genetic evaluation systems, estimation of genetic parameters, breeding structure, strategies for the effective dissemination of the improved strain, and use of DNA information in selective breeding programs. Currently, we are broadening the scope of our training program by including other topics such as genetic conservation, risk assessment in relation to the use of improved strains, and resource management and biodiversity.
