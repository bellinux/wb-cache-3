5000|$|Following {{a summary}} of the prior, Fausto-Sterling shows her points on the gender {{development}} theories by noting how XY and XX chromosomes stay identical up until the 6th week of development in the womb. During these six weeks, the XY/XX embryos develop an indifferent gonad, an extra layer that isn't affected by the chromosome embryo due to their indistinguishable similarity at the time. This external process develops in a similar manner to the various male and female reproductive organs that later develop within the body. By {{the end of the first}} month and a half, all embryos would've developed, regardless of gender. In addition, the chromosomes within the cells will have developed different <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> Mesonephric <b>ducts</b> that are indifferent to gender. A <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>ducts</b> ultimately becomes the aforementioned reproductive organs based on the gender of the fetus. Once the Y chromosome in the XY embryo triggers, an extensive and lengthy process is detailed on the development of male fetuses. Conversely, far less is known on the development of XX fetuses. What is known about the female XX is that the fetuses produce approximately the same amount of estrogen in comparison to the testosterone production in the male XY. Later down the line of fetus growth, the originally identical genitalia of the two types of fetus will differentiate on the eighth week. In some cases the XY fetus will initially begin to develop a female crotch instead of the male penis and scrotum due to a deficiency in dihydrotestosterone. After detailing the opinions of John Money and Julianne Imperato-McGuinely on gender identity, Fausto-Sterling concludes with the three influences that affect gender - genetic regulatory information, intrusion from outside the womb, and [...] "chance variation" [...] in development - and two points on sexual development." ...|$|R
5|$|Given that {{ascending}} cholangitis usually {{occurs in}} the <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> bile <b>duct</b> obstruction, various forms of medical imaging may be employed to identify the site and nature of this obstruction.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper an {{iterative}} time-reversal algorithm that retrofocuses an acoustic wave field to its controllable part is established. For a fixed temporal support, i. e., transducer excitation time, the algorithm generates an optimal retrofocusing in the least-squares sense. Thus the iterative time-reversal algorithm reduces the temporal support of the excitation from the requirement of negligible remaining energy to the requirement of controllability. The time-reversal retrofocusing is analyzed from a boundary-control perspective where time reversal is used to steer the acoustic wave field towards a desired state. The wave field is controlled by transducers located at subsets of the boundary, i. e., the controllable part of the boundary. The time-reversal cavity and time-reversal mirror cases are analyzed. In the cavity case, the transducers generate a locally plane wave in the fundamental mode through a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>ducts.</b> Numerical examples are given to illustrate the convergence of the iterative time-reversal algorithm. In the mirror case, a homogeneous half space is considered. For this case the analytic expression for the retrofocused wave field is given for finite temporal support.

In combination with maternal components, a quanti-tative chromosomal signal, provided by the ratio of X chromosomes to <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> autosomes (X: A), regulates a key gene (Sxl). The functional state, ON or OFF, of Sxl, via a few subordinate regulatory genes, controls a switch gene (dsx) that can express two mutually exclusive functions, M or F. These serve to repress either the female or the <b>male</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> differentiation genes, thus directing the cells either into the male or into the female sexual pathway. Investigations of control genes and their regulation show that they have properties of homeotic genes. Their role is to select one of two alternative develop-mental programs. Their function, or lack of function, is required throughout development to maintain the cells in their respective sexual pathway. Differentiation genes are under negative control by dsx. We discuss the cis- and tams-regulatory elements that are needed for sex-, tissue- and stage-specific expression of the differentiation genes. A comparison of Drosophila to other organisms such as Caenorhabditis, mammals and other insects indicates similarities that we interpret as evidence for a basically invariant genetic strategy used by various organisms to regulate sexual development...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the detailed skeletal anatomy of chasmopinid trilobites from the Ordovician of the Oslo region, and Phacops from the Polish Devonian. Lamination of the cuticle {{is similar to}} that previously reported, and the outermost prismatic layer has been conclusively proved. Several types of tubercles or pustules {{on the surface of the}} exoskeleton have been identified, for which a classification is proposed. Canals through the exoskeleton range from about 1 - 40 micro-m in diameter. In Chasmops spp. apparently smooth tubercles have a thin central canal through the outer zone changing downwards into a wide canal. This smooth tubercle organ shows some resemblance with the sensory campanular organ (mechanoreceptor) in Recent arthropods. Sections of the big composite tubercles or pustules in Phacops have revealed two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>ducts,</b> partly with different directions: (1) numerous close-set fine (4 micro-m) canals in a fan-like arrangement, and (2) diffuse ramifying branches or tubes with distal bundles of tubules, the blunt terminals of which are inserted into the lower surface of the outer zone of the exoskeleton. This internal tubules organ might possibly, in general features, be analogous with the much smaller campanular organ in the halteres in Diptera. Just below the prismatic layer there are numerous small (10 - 20 micro-m) subsphaeric cavities apparently connected with the epidermis by a single thin (1. 5 - 2. 0 micro-m) perpendicular canal, which are termed Osmolska cavity organs. There is a considerable variation in muscle-scar pattern. Some species have calluses on the inner surface corresponding to shallow pits on the outer surface. Similar pits and dark patches, and knobs or calluses on the inner surface of the exoskeleton, are scars or small apodemes of muscles leading from the dorsal exoskeleton to the presumed thin membrane representing the ventral body wall inside the marginal doublure. ...|$|R
