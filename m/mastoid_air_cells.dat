40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the association between}} nasal septal deviation (NSD) and the volume of <b>mastoid</b> <b>air</b> <b>cell</b> pneumatization and compare it with the volume of maxillary sinus in a pediatric population. MATERIALS and METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted at a university-based, secondary referral hospital. Paranasal sinus CT imaging data of 59 children were reconstructed to the 3 -dimensional model, and subsequently, we measured {{the volume of the}} maxillary sinus and <b>mastoid</b> <b>air</b> <b>cell.</b> On coronal images, nasal septal angle (NSA) and NSD/NC (nasal septal deviation/nasal cavity) ratio were measured. RESULTS: <b>Mastoid</b> <b>air</b> <b>cell</b> volume, as well as maxillary sinus volume, of the deviated side was smaller than that of the contralateral side, but these were not statistically significant. There was no correlation between NSA and volumes of <b>mastoid</b> <b>air</b> <b>cell</b> and the maxillary sinus. There also was no correlation between NSD/NC ratio and <b>mastoid</b> <b>air</b> <b>cell</b> and maxillary sinus volumes. Significant linear and growth regression was found between age and volume of the <b>mastoid</b> <b>air</b> <b>cell</b> and maxillary sinus but not between age and NSA and NSD/NC ratio. CONCLUSION: <b>Mastoid</b> <b>air</b> <b>cell</b> volume and maxillary sinus volume of the deviated side tended to be smaller than those of the contralateral side, which suggests that NSD can influence both aerations. However, because the degree of NSD did not correlate with the volumes of the <b>mastoid</b> <b>air</b> <b>cell</b> and maxillary sinus in this study, we should consider that further possible factors may be involved in both aerations...|$|R

Retrospective case series. Amsterdam, department of otorhinolaryngology and head and neck surgery. Classification of temporal bone ORN was performed through use of clinical data and radiologic imaging. Outcomes of conservative and surgical treatment were investigated and compared for different grades of ORN. Of the 49 ears included in this study, 35 were primarily treated conservatively. At start of conservative treatment, 23 were classified as a localized and 8 as a diffuse form of ORN; 4 could not be classified. There {{was a significant difference}} in clinical outcome between the localized and diffuse forms of ORN (χ(2) = 5. 862, P =. 015), and <b>mastoid</b> <b>air</b> <b>cell</b> destruction on preoperative computed tomography scan was found to be a significant predictor for a negative outcome of conservative treatment (χ(2) = 4. 34, P =. 037).

50|$|Koerner's septum is an {{anatomic}} boundary in {{the temporal}} bone formed by the petrosquamous suture between the petrous and squamosal portions of the <b>mastoid</b> <b>air</b> <b>cells,</b> at the anatomic level of the antrum. Along with the middle ear ossicles, it is usually eroded in middle ear cholesteatomas. Superiorly, this continues as the petrosquamous suture, a normal anatomic structure that can be mistaken for fractures on temporal bone CT.|$|E
50|$|Otitis {{media with}} {{effusion}} (OME), {{also known as}} serous otitis media (SOM) or secretory otitis media (SOM), and colloquially referred to as 'glue ear,' is fluid accumulation that can occur in the middle ear and <b>mastoid</b> <b>air</b> <b>cells</b> due to negative pressure produced by dysfunction of the Eustachian tube. This {{can be associated with}} a viral URI or bacterial infection such as otitis media. An effusion can cause conductive hearing loss if it interferes with the transmission of vibrations of middle ear bones to the vestibulocochlear nerve complex that are created by sound waves.|$|E
50|$|Brain abscess (or {{cerebral}} abscess) is an abscess {{caused by}} inflammation and collection of infected material, coming from local (ear infection, dental abscess, infection of paranasal sinuses, {{infection of the}} <b>mastoid</b> <b>air</b> <b>cells</b> of the temporal bone, epidural abscess) or remote (lung, heart, kidney etc.) infectious sources, within the brain tissue. The infection may also be introduced through a skull fracture following a head trauma or surgical procedures. Brain abscess is usually associated with congenital heart disease in young children. It may occur at any age but is most frequent in the third decade of life.|$|E
50|$|Mastoiditis is {{the result}} of an {{infection}} that extends to the <b>air</b> <b>cells</b> of the skull behind the ear. Specifically, it is an inflammation of the mucosal lining of the mastoid antrum and <b>mastoid</b> <b>air</b> <b>cell</b> system inside the mastoid process. The mastoid process is the portion of the temporal bone of the skull that is behind the ear which contains open, air-containing spaces. Mastoiditis is usually caused by untreated acute otitis media (middle ear infection) and used to be a leading cause of child mortality. With the development of antibiotics, however, mastoiditis has become quite rare in developed countries where surgical treatment is now much less frequent and more conservative, unlike former times. Additionally, {{there is no evidence that}} the drop in antibiotic prescribing for otitis media has increased the incidence of mastoiditis, raising the possibility that the drop in reported cases is due to a confounding factor such as childhood immunizations against Haemophilus and Streptococci. Untreated, the infection can spread to surrounding structures, including the brain, causing serious complications.|$|R
40|$|Acute mastoiditis, a {{destructive}} bacterial {{infection of the}} <b>mastoid</b> bone and <b>air</b> <b>cell</b> system, is relatively uncommon today but remains a potentially serious condition.

40|$|Otitis Media with Effusion (OME) is difined as {{the chronic}} {{accumulation}} of mucus within {{the middle ear}} and sometimes the <b>mastoid</b> <b>air</b> <b>cell</b> system. Significant hearing loss may go unnoticed and may result in improper development of speech and language. Foreign bodies in {{the external auditory canal}} of paediatric patients are commonly encountered in day-to-day practice. The purpose was {{to see if there is}} any relation between foreign bodies in ears and otitis media with effusion. A prospective study of consecutive cases was conducted between August 2005 and August 2007 at a teaching hospital. All children presenting with the history of a foreign body in the external auditory canal were included in this study. 50 / 74 that is 67. 8 % of the children in the study group had abnormal findings in the tympanogram whereas only 28 / 74 that is 37. 8 % children from the control group had abnormal findings in tympanogram. This study indicates that significant eustachian tube dysfunction to frank OME, causes irritation and/or earache in children which may compel them to put things into the ear. So children with an external auditory foreign body must be followed up in an ENT clinic. This may be an early opportunity to diagnose an underlying undetected OME and/or eustachian tube dysfunction in children, preventing the development of any complication from the undetected OME...|$|R
5000|$|The {{pathophysiology}} of mastoiditis is straightforward: bacteria {{spread from}} the middle ear to the <b>mastoid</b> <b>air</b> <b>cells,</b> where the inflammation causes damage to the bony structures. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis {{are the most common}} organisms recovered in acute mastoiditis. Organisms that are rarely found are Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Gram-negative aerobic bacilli, and anaerobic bacteria. P. aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae, S. aureus and anaerobic bacteria (Prevotella, Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, and Peptostreptococcus spp. [...] ) are the most common isolates in chronic mastoiditis. Rarely, Mycobacterium species can also cause the infection. Some mastoiditis is caused by cholesteatoma, which is a sac of keratinizing squamous epithelium in the middle ear that usually results from repeated middle-ear infections. If left untreated, the cholesteatoma can erode into the mastoid process, producing mastoiditis, as well as other complications.|$|E
5000|$|Schuller's view is {{a lateral}} {{radiographic}} view of skull principally used for viewing mastoid cells. The central beam of X-rays passes {{from one side}} of the head and is at angle of 25° caudad to radiographic plate. This angulation prevents overlap of images of two mastoid bones. Radiograph for each mastoid is taken separately. The Schullers view serves as an alternative view to the Law projection which uses a 15 degree angle of patient's face toward the image receptor and a 15 degree caudal angulation of the CR to achieve the same result, a lateral <b>mastoid</b> <b>air</b> <b>cells</b> view without overlap of the opposite side. Ear(pinna) under examination can be taped forward to avoid cartilage shadow around mastoid. Older editions of Merrill's positioning books will have detailed explanation of these and other mastoid positions. Newer texts often omit this because of the rarity of this exam in lieu of computed tomography studies.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to these a large irregular cavity is situated at the upper and front part of the bone. It is called the tympanic antrum, and must be distinguished from the mastoid cells, though it communicates with them. Like the mastoid cells {{it is filled with}} air and lined by a prolongation of the mucous membrane of the tympanic cavity, with which it communicates. The tympanic antrum is bounded above by a thin plate of bone, the tegmen tympani, which separates it from the middle fossa of the base of the skull; below by the mastoid process; laterally by the squama just below the temporal line, and medially by the lateral semicircular canal of the internal ear which projects into its cavity. It opens in front into that portion of the tympanic cavity which is known as the attic or epitympanic recess. The tympanic antrum is a cavity of some considerable size at the time of birth; the <b>mastoid</b> <b>air</b> <b>cells</b> may be regarded as diverticula from the antrum, and begin to appear at or before birth; by the fifth year they are well-marked, but their development is not completed until toward puberty.|$|E

Unfamiliarity with the underlying cause of a swollen cheek can lead to delay of proper treatment with potential harm to the patient.

We herein present a rare case report of zygomatic abscess associated with otitis media along with its clinical presentation, root of spread and review of its medical and surgical management, with emphasis on the methods for accurate diagnosis. We report on a 55 -years-old man who presented with right ear discharge with decreased hearing.

40|$|Background/Objective: We {{assessed}} {{the validity of}} computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of complicated chronic otitis media (COM). "nPatients and Methods: The findings obtained from a pre-operative high resolution CT of temporal bone including coronal and axial views of 20 patients with complicated COM were compared to their intraoperative findings. "nResults: In our study, CT was helpful in determining the anatomy of the mastoid and could accurately predict the <b>mastoid</b> <b>air</b> <b>cell</b> aeration, size and status of ossicles, presence of lateral semicirculal canal (SCC) fistula and post-auricular fistula (All sensitivities equal to 100 %). But it overdiagnosed the erosion of tegmen (positive predictive value of 50 %). CT was unable to distinguish between cholesteatoma and fluid (abscess or effusion) and granulation tissue or polyps and was also unable to correctly reveal the facial nerve dehiscence and had a low sensitivity for showing erosion of facial canal (50 %) and sigmoid sinus (60 %). "nConclusion: Because most complications resulting from cholesteatoma are caused by bony erosions, CT is helpful in determining the complications of COM. CT can accurately predict the extent of disease and is helpful in detection of some complications such as fistula of Lateral Semicircular Canal (LSC), erosions of dural plate and ossicular erosions. However, it is unable to distinguish between cholesteatoma, mucosal disease and fluid, and little it did contribute to detecting the facial nerve course and dehiscence.

40|$|Cell {{therapy is}} an {{emerging}} {{facet of the}} regenerative medicine discipline. Innovation in this field is providing new solutions {{for the treatment of}} diseases and lost functionality of the human body. These are therapies that have cells as the active agent and in particular human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are proven to be useful in this context. For these treatments to be widely available and marketed widely there is a requirement to overcome bottle necks within the product life cycle. One such bottle neck is the reproducible generation of enough cells on a mass manufacturing scale. Following this is the transport of the therapeutic cells from the production facility to the care giving facility without the extra complication of cryopreservation. The final aspect of the life cycle discussed here is the delivery of the cells to the patient. In this case as part of a tissue-engineering construct for the regeneration of mastoid bone. A temperature responsive magnetic particle gel dispersion was demonstrated as a surface capable of supporting the growth of a 3 T 3 cell line. It was also shown that cells grown on this surface could be subcultured on this surface by reducing the temperature to 10 DC and applying a magnetic field as to separate the cells. These cells were seeded on to new gels and showed that the population increased with time. A model of a system capable of transporting live hMSCs in sealed units was investigated. The multivariate. experiment took into consideration different temperatures of 4 DC, 23 DC, 27 DC and 37 DC, varying cell density of 5 x 104 and 10 x 104 cells per well and media volumes set at 1 ml and 2 ml per well. The results showed that over a 7 day period the most important factor was the time at any given condition. The factors of media volume and cell density had no bearing on the measured outcome of percentage of viable or apoptotic cells as measured by flow cytometry.

40|$|Background: Loss {{of hearing}} is a {{national}} health problem with significant social and psychosocial implications. Worldwide there are about 65 - 330 million people affected with hearing impairment, of which 60 % suffers from significant hearing loss. Role of tympanic membrane and ossicular chain in the physiology of hearing is well documented. The emergence of {{the role played by}} <b>mastoid</b> <b>air</b> space volume in sound transmission is being critically evaluated these days. The present study is designed to analyze the effect of <b>mastoid</b> <b>air</b> space volume in tympanic membrane perforation with conductive hearing loss. Methods: 32 subjects both male and female with medium sized tympanic membrane perforation were included in the study. They were grouped into two (those with sclerotic and cellular mastoid). Hearing threshold assessed using pure tone audiometer. <b>Mastoid</b> <b>air</b> space volume evaluated using digital X-ray mastoid schuller's view. Tympanic membrane perforation size assessed using otoscope. Results: The hearing loss in first group having cellular mastoid and second group with sclerotic mastoid were 22. 82 +/- 6. 28 and 27. 82 +/- 5. 66 respectively. Their p value was 0. 026 which was statistically significant. Conclusions: <b>Mastoid</b> <b>air</b> space volume is inversely proportional to conductive hearing loss.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed CT scans of the temporal bone obtained in 1255 patients (573 men and 682 women; mean age, 42 years).
