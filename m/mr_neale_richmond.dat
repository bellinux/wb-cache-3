6000|$|These {{words were}} {{confirmed}} by a thud as of a fist striking the kitchen table. In the normal evolution of his sympathy Stevie had become angry on discovering {{that he had}} no shilling in his pocket. In his inability to relieve at once <b>Mrs</b> <b>Neale’s</b> “little ’uns’” privations, he felt that somebody should be made to suffer for it. Mrs Verloc rose, and went into the kitchen to “stop that nonsense.” And she did it firmly but gently. She was well aware that directly <b>Mrs</b> <b>Neale</b> received her money she went round the corner to drink ardent spirits in a mean and musty public-house—the unavoidable station on the via dolorosa of her life. Mrs Verloc’s comment upon this practice had an unexpected profundity, as coming from a person disinclined to look under the surface of things. “Of course, what is she to do to keep up? If I were like <b>Mrs</b> <b>Neale</b> I expect I wouldn’t act any different.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, my friends, I'm serious," [...] she returned, earnestly. [...] "This awful {{place is}} getting on my nerves.... <b>Mr.</b> <b>Neale</b> here, {{he would have}} had to face a gun already but for me." ...|$|R
50|$|The school's first headmaster, Mr D J Lyon, was {{appointed}} on 1 January 2013. Mr Lyon had previously worked at schools in Northampton and Milton Keynes. The deputy, <b>Mr</b> <b>Neale</b> Pledger has considerable experience in Milton Keynes schools.|$|R
6000|$|Already at {{the clatter}} of the shop bell <b>Mrs</b> <b>Neale,</b> blackleading the parlour grate, had looked through the door, and rising from her knees had gone, aproned, and grimy with {{everlasting}} toil, to tell Mrs Verloc in the kitchen that “there was the master come back.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... “There’s <b>Mrs</b> <b>Neale</b> at {{it again}} with her {{harrowing}} tales about her little children. They can’t be all so little as she makes them out. Some of them must be big enough by now {{to try to do}} something for themselves. It only makes Stevie angry.” ...|$|R
50|$|In November 2013 the {{management}} {{team led by}} founder and CEO Mark Neale bought out minority shareholder LDC to take full ownership of the retail chain. <b>Mr</b> <b>Neale</b> personally owns 85% of the business. The £85m deal was backed by the Royal Bank of Scotland and asset management firm Alcentra.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Neale</b> was the charwoman of Brett Street. Victim of her {{marriage}} with a debauched joiner, she was oppressed by the needs of many infant children. Red-armed, and aproned in coarse sacking up to the arm-pits, she exhaled the anguish of the poor in a breath of soap-suds and rum, in the uproar of scrubbing, in the clatter of tin pails.|$|R
50|$|In the 2007-08 season, ill-health {{meant that}} the club's owner, Ted Stocker, decided to sell his shares. March 2008 saw local {{businessman}} Ian Neale planned to take ownership of the club for a trial period. However, he took 100% ownership of the club in April. In May 2008, <b>Mr</b> <b>Neale</b> found some irregularities in the finances of the club, raising fears that the club {{would have to be}} forced into administration.|$|R
5000|$|Hindmarsh {{joined the}} Royal Navy either in April 1793 (aged seven or eight), or on 19 July 1790 (aged five). In 1793 he was {{listed on the}} muster roll of the Bellerophon as the servant of his father. He was schooled by <b>Mr</b> <b>Neale,</b> the purser of the Bellerophon. [...] He saw action on the Bellerophon at the Battle of the Glorious First of June in 1794 and the Battle of the Nile in 1798.|$|R
5000|$|Senator <b>Neale</b> <b>Richmond</b> {{was elected}} to Seanad Eireann in 2016, {{previously}} elected to Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council in 2009 to represent the Glencullen - Sandyford Ward. He {{is a member of}} the Fine Gael party. Neale was re-elected in 2014 on the first count. Following his re-election to the Council, Neale was appointed by the Taoiseach as one of Ireland's nine delegates to the EU's Committee of the Regions. Neale was appointed Chair of the Seanad Select Committee on the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union on 23 February 2017. [...] Neale’s priorities include the housing market, jobs and emigration; issues that he believes are affecting younger generations.|$|R

50|$|Eventually {{the truth}} surfaced. A boarding-house keeper, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Neale,</b> {{recognised}} {{her from the}} picture in the Bristol Journal and informed her hosts. This would-be princess was in truth Mary Willcocks, a cobbler's daughter from Witheridge, Devon. She had been a servant girl around England but had found no place to stay. She invented her fictitious language from imaginary and gypsy words and created an exotic character and story. The odd marks on her head were scars from a crude cupping operation in a poorhouse hospital in London. The British press made much of the hoax {{at the expense of}} the duped rustic middle-class.|$|R
50|$|The ship {{finally arrived}} in New York on May 31. They {{stayed in the}} city for a month, sailing out on the Fourth of July, for Norfolk, Virginia, where they landed five days later. They then {{transferred}} to a sloop, for the final leg of the journey to Maryland, where they arrived on July 10. They then stayed for a week at the home of the brother of the late Mother Mary Margaret and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Neale's</b> cousin, before proceeding to Port Tobacco, St. Mary's County, the county seat, where Neale built them a house at his own expense.|$|R
50|$|The United Kingdom has now {{admitted}} that Mr Graley's Article 8 Rights were breached {{by the actions}} of the Chief Minister of the Isle of Man on the advice of the Isle of Man Attorney General. The Interceptions of Communications Tribunal on the Isle of Man found in favour of a second applicant,Toby Neale, a serving police officer, that a warrant to intercept his communications was unlawful, and the United Kingdom also admitted a similar breach there. Another retired police officer, Roger Thomson, applied to the Strasbourg Court in respect of his telephone calls being intercepted. All three, <b>Mr</b> Graley, <b>Mr</b> <b>Neale</b> and <b>Mr</b> Thompson have received cash settlements from the Isle of Man Government in respect of damages.|$|R

50|$|He died at 5 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, 30 Aug. 1852, aged 72, and {{was buried}} in the chancel of North Marston Church on 9 Sept. By his will, after bequeathing a few trifling legacies, he left the whole of his property, {{estimated}} at £500,000, to ‘Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, begging Her Majesty's most gracious acceptance of the same for her sole use and benefit.’ Two caveats were entered against the will, but were subsequently withdrawn. Queen Victoria increased Neild's bequests to the three executors from £100 to £1,000 each, she provided for his servants, for whom he made no provision, and she secured an annuity of £100 to <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Neale,</b> who had frustrated Neild's attempt at suicide. In 1855 Queen Victoria restored the chancel of North Marston Church and inserted a window to Neild's memory.|$|R
50|$|Records in the UK National Archives show Neale's {{home address}} was Thornwood, Epping, Essex with {{next of kin}} <b>Mrs</b> G. <b>Neale,</b> his mother. His {{occupation}} prior to the First World War was Mechanical and Electrical Engineer, and his initial service during the war was in the Army Service Corps Motor Transport as a probationary second lieutenant.|$|R
60|$|There <b>Mrs</b> <b>Neale</b> was {{scrubbing}} the floor. At Stevie’s appearance she groaned lamentably, having observed {{that he could}} be induced easily to bestow for the benefit of her infant children the shilling his sister Winnie presented him with from time to time. On all fours amongst the puddles, wet and begrimed, like a sort of amphibious and domestic animal living in ash-bins and dirty water, she uttered the usual exordium: “It’s all very well for you, kept doing nothing like a gentleman.” And she followed it with the everlasting plaint of the poor, pathetically mendacious, miserably authenticated by the horrible breath of cheap rum and soap-suds. She scrubbed hard, snuffling all the time, and talking volubly. And she was sincere. And on each side of her thin red nose her bleared, misty eyes swam in tears, because she felt really the want of some sort of stimulant in the morning.|$|R
5000|$|Since September 2005, {{the school}} has been led by <b>Mrs</b> Vicky <b>Neale,</b> {{following}} the retirement of Adrian Williams, who obtained a CBE for Services to Education after many years at the school. As of 2014, there are around 90 teaching staff. [...] The most recent workforce statistics from the Department for Education indicates the Academy's pupil-teacher ratio of 14.4:1 is lower than both the Suffolk LEA average of 16:1 in Secondary Schools and 15.7:1 for England as a whole.|$|R
50|$|Over the {{ten years}} Neale served this community, he {{maintained}} contact with his friends and colleagues back in Maryland. Through this dialogue, the nuns were encouraged to attempt a foundation in the new nation, the United States of America, which had emerged from the American Revolution during that period. The decision was made and Neale offered to accompany the women on their return voyage to their native land. Initially, the intention was to have his cousin, Mother Mary Margaret, lead the new foundation; her death in 1784 precluded that. The small community was to be led by Mother Bernardina Teresa Xavier of St. Joseph, O.C.D. (born Ann Teresa Matthews), who was to serve as prioress. (Her older brother was also a former Jesuit priest still serving the Maryland Mission, who died one month before her return.) She was accompanied by her nieces, Sisters Mary Eleanora of St. Francis Xavier, O.C.D., and Mary Aloysia of the Blessed Trinity, O.C.D. (Susana and Ann Teresa Matthews). The final member had been chosen by <b>Mr.</b> <b>Neale</b> himself, Sister Clare Joseph of the Sacred Heart, O.C.D. (born Frances Dickinson), who was an Englishwoman.|$|R
50|$|Succeeding in 1814 to {{the whole}} of his father's property, {{estimated}} at £250,000, he developed into a confirmed miser, and {{the last thirty years}} of his life were solely employed in accumulating wealth. He lived in a large house, 5 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, but it was so meanly furnished that for some time he had not a bed to lie on. His dress consisted of a blue swallow-tailed coat with gilt buttons, brown trousers, short gaiters, and shoes which were patched and generally down at the heels. He never allowed his clothes to be brushed, because, he said, it destroyed the nap. He continually visited his numerous estates, walking whenever it was possible, never went to the expense of a great-coat, and always stayed with his tenants, sharing their coarse meals and lodging. While at North Marston, in Buckinghamshire, about 1828 he attempted to cut his throat, and his life was only saved by the prompt attention of his tenant's wife, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Neale.</b> Unlike other eminent misers - Daniel Dancer or John Elwes - he occasionally indulged in acts of benevolence, possessed considerable knowledge of legal and general literature, and to the last retained a love for the classics.|$|R
50|$|In 1909, George's {{desire to}} own his own {{insurance}} company became a reality: He {{and his brother}} Charles formed the Phypers Brothers Company. By 1910 the company was the fifth largest and was mentioned in a volume on the History of Cleveland. Charles later left the Phypers company, and George joined his company with that of <b>Mr.</b> Harold <b>Neale.</b> Today that company is still in existence in Independence, Ohio, and {{is known as the}} Neale-Phypers Corporation. Over the years, George would become well known in the insurance industry. He {{served as president of the}} Insurance Board of Cleveland (1947-48).|$|R
60|$|Now {{nearly all}} men find it {{difficult}} to do that name sufficient honour. One of the most splendid steam-ships in America is called after his name. A magnificent ship, for the China trade, was built at Aberdeen by Walter Hood & Co., which so swiftly traversed the ocean as to have made the voyage from Canton to London in ninety-nine days, without any aid from steam. This beautiful and grand specimen of the perfection of naval architecture is named The John Bunyan. Roman Catholics have printed large editions of the Pilgrim, with slight omissions, for circulation among the young under the care of the nuns. Our English fanatics have committed a crime that would make a papist blush. A Rev. E. Neale has clumsily altered the Pilgrim's Progress, that Bunyan might appear to teach the things which Bunyan's righteous heaven-born soul abhorred. It is a piece of matchless self-conceit to think of mending that which has been admired by the wisest of the human race in all nations, and which has obtained an unbounded popularity. Such an attempt to alter it is an acknowledgment that all the boasted power of Oxford, Exeter, and Rome, are unable to invent a tale to supersede the matchless beauties of the work of our spiritually-minded, heavenly-assisted brazier. If <b>Mr.</b> <b>Neale</b> should, at any time, alter a deed and the punishment for that felony is transportation for life. A similar forgery was committed in a recent London edition of Dr. Cheever's Hill Difficulty. The Tractarians, doubtless, commit these scandalous outrages upon the Fathers, and all other writers, and deserve the contempt of every honest, upright mind.|$|R
50|$|After his return, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Neale</b> worked tirelessly to {{maintain}} {{the works of the}} Society from prior to the Suppression and to restore the Society of Jesus as an official Order. In 1803, the members of the Maryland Mission, consisting of the surviving former Jesuits, learned that, two years earlier, Pope Pius VII had approved the continuation of the Society in Russia, where the decree of suppression had never been implemented by the Empress Catherine the Great. As a Russian Orthodox ruler, she had no obligation to obey a papal order, and she valued the educational works of the Jesuits in the territories she ruled, particularly Poland. Thus in May of that year, Bishop John Carroll, the sole Ordinary for the entire nation, supported by his coadjutor bishop, Leonard Neale (Charles' brother), both of whom were former members of the Society, appealed to the new Father General in Russia that the former Jesuits in the United States be re-admitted to the Society, noting that the structure of the Jesuit Mission in Maryland had remained intact {{from the time of the}} Suppression up to that date. The Father General agreed and authorized the re-admission of the former Jesuits to the Society, appointing Father Robert Molyneux as Superior for the United States. Thus, Charles Neale was finally able to profess his vows as a Jesuit for the first time on August 18, 1805. The following summer, he was appointed Vice Superior for Charles and St. Mary's counties. Neale made his final profession of solemn vows on November 16 of that same year at the Jesuit church in Georgetown.|$|R
60|$|She dragged herself painfully {{across the}} shop, {{and had to}} hold on to the handle of the door before she found the {{necessary}} fortitude to open it. The street frightened her, since it led either to the gallows or to the river. She floundered over the doorstep head forward, arms thrown out, like a person falling over the parapet of a bridge. This entrance into the open air had a foretaste of drowning; a slimy dampness enveloped her, entered her nostrils, clung to her hair. It was not actually raining, but each gas lamp had a rusty little halo of mist. The van and horses were gone, and in the black street the curtained window of the carters’ eating-house made a square patch of soiled blood-red light glowing faintly very near the level of the pavement. Mrs Verloc, dragging herself slowly towards it, thought that she was a very friendless woman. It was true. It was so true that, in a sudden longing to see some friendly face, she could think of no one else but of <b>Mrs</b> <b>Neale,</b> the charwoman. She had no acquaintances of her own. Nobody would miss her in a social way. It must not be imagined that the Widow Verloc had forgotten her mother. This was not so. Winnie had been a good daughter because she had been a devoted sister. Her mother had always leaned on her for support. No consolation or advice could be expected there. Now that Stevie was dead the bond seemed to be broken. She could not face the old woman with the horrible tale. Moreover, it was too far. The river was her present destination. Mrs Verloc tried to forget her mother.|$|R
50|$|In 1723 Mr William Simson or Simpson {{obtained}} the property from the Earl. in 1721 he married Barbara Barclay of Warrix {{and after she}} died, to Elizabeth Moore of Bruntwood in 1726. His first wife's {{father had been a}} Provost of Irvine. He also had a third marriage in 1736 to Hannah Crochet or Crokat of Glasgow. He had three daughters, Janet, Margaret and Elizabeth, together with a son William. William Simson was said to be a man of expensive tastes and his son William was forced in 1772 to sell the estate to Mr John Ker of London. By 1777 Mr Ker had sold the property to <b>Mr</b> John <b>Neale</b> or Neil of Edinburgh. In 1804 John Neale sold the property to Mr Robert Steel of Port Glasgow with John and Robert Duncan recorded as tenants. By 1833 William Wilson (son of Janet Simson) had purchased his ancestraal lands of Willowyards and his nephew, Alexander Shedden of Morishil later inherited.|$|R

50|$|On March 15, 1964, a pilot {{with the}} U.S. Navy's Flight Demonstration Squadron, the Blue Angels, was killed during an {{attempted}} emergency landing at Apalachicola Municipal Airport when his F-11A Tiger experienced engine difficulties while transiting from West Palm Beach, Florida {{back to the}} Blue Angels' home base at NAS Pensacola, Florida. LT George L. Neale, USN, age 29, who flew in the Number Four slot position of the diamond formation, was returning from a demonstration at West Palm Beach with one other of the six team jets and an R5D Skymaster support plane when he radioed Tyndall Air Force Base, near Panama City, Florida, that he was declaring an emergency and requesting permission to land at Tyndall AFB when he suffered engine mechanical problems south of Apalachicola. Spotting the Apalachicola Airport, he attempted a landing there, ejecting on final approach at 1115 hrs. as the fighter came down ~250 yards short of the runway. Although he cleared the airframe at ~150-200 feet altitude, his chute did not have sufficient time to deploy and he was killed. He was {{survived by his wife}} Donna, of Pensacola, Florida, and his mother, <b>Mrs.</b> Katherine <b>Neale,</b> of Avalon, Pennsylvania. Official Navy press reports at the time said that the cause of the mishap was being investigated.|$|R
50|$|On {{the east}} side of the loch lie the ancient lands of Willowyard, locally {{pronounced}} 'Williyard', and the various Mains dwellings associated with it. These lands were passed to Helen, daughter of Robert Lord Boyd, in her pure, spotless, and inviolate virginity and were held by her for life, the feu for the property passing to the abbot and convent of Kilwinning. Blaeu's map of Timothy Pont's survey marks the property as 'Williezeards'. In 1559 Hugh Montgomery of Hessilhead held the lands of old extent of Williyard, in the parish of Beith and regality of Kilwinning. The lands became the property of the Hon. Francis Montgomerie of Giffin and then passed to his nephew, Alexander, 9th Earl of Eglinton. in 1723 Mr William Simson or Simpson obtained the property from the Earl. Mr Simpson was said to be a man of expensive tastes and his son William was forced in 1772 to sell the estate to Mr John Ker of London.
