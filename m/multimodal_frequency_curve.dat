40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the question of}} how to select the minimum set of storms that should be simulated each year in order to estimate an accurate flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curve</b> for return periods ranging between 1 and 1000 years. The Manzanares basin (Spain) was used as a study case. A continuous 100, 000 -year hourly rainfall series was generated using the stochastic spatial–temporal model RanSimV 3. Individual storms were extracted from the series by applying the exponential method. For each year, the extracted storms were transformed into hydrographs by applying an hourly time-step semi-distributed event-based rainfall–runoff model, and the maximum peak flow per year was determined to generate the reference flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curve.</b> Then, different flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curves</b> were obtained considering the N storms with maximum rainfall depth per year, with 1 ≤ N ≤ total number of storms. Main results show that: (a) the degree of alignment between the calculated flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curves</b> and the reference flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curve</b> depends on the return period considered, increasing the accuracy for higher return periods; (b) for the analyzed case studies, the flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curve</b> for medium and high return period (50 ≤ return period ≤ 1000 years) can be estimated with a difference lower than 3 % (compared to the reference flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curve)</b> by considering the three storms with the maximum total rainfall depth each year; (c) when considering only the greatest storm of the year, for return periods higher than 10 years, the difference for the estimation of the flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curve</b> is lower than 10 %; and (d) when considering the three greatest storms each year, for return periods higher than 100 years, the probability of achieving simultaneously a hydrograph with the annual maximum peak flow and the maximum volume is 94 %...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{illustrate}} the effects of selected catchment storage thresholds upon runoff behaviour, and specifically their impact upon flood frequency. The analysis is carried out with the use of a stochastic rainfall model, incorporating rainfall variability at intra-event, inter-event and seasonal timescales, as well as infrequent summer tropical cyclones, coupled with deterministic rainfall-runoff models that incorporate runoff generation by both saturation excess and subsurface stormflow mechanisms. Changing runoff generation mechanisms (i. e. from subsurface flow to surface runoff) associated with a given threshold (i. e. saturation storage capacity) are shown to be manifested in the flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curve</b> as a break in slope. It is observed that the inclusion of infrequent summer storm events increases the temporal frequency occurrence and magnitude of surface runoff events, in this way contributing to steeper flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curves,</b> and an additional break in the slope of the flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curve.</b> The results of this study highlight the importance of thresholds on flood frequency, and provide insights into the complex interactions between rainfall variability and threshold nonlinearities in the rainfall-runoff process, which are shown to have a significant impact on the resulting flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curves...</b>|$|R

Specifically, they observed errors that are caused by numerical evaluations of the frequency equation of a fixed-free axially vibrating bar with a lumped mass attached at a point along the span of the bar (see Figure 1). The frequency equation and the corresponding mode shapes of teh system of Figure 1 are given in reference [2].

40|$|Recent large {{flooding}} {{events have}} reinforced {{the need for}} prudent flood risk management. The July 2007 floods in Yorkshire and the Midlands and the November 2009 floods in the Lake District have highlighted the current vulnerability of key infrastructure and the built environment in the UK to flooding. This existing flood risk is coupled with concerns over the potential impacts of future climate change on flood regimes. Therefore, {{there is a need}} to develop tools and methodologies to assess the potential impact of likely climate change on flood risk. The link between large rainfall and flow events is first examined, as well as an assessment of the seasonality of these events. This reveals a distinct east-west split in the seasonal concentration of flooding. This work provides a basis for the development of a statistical modelling technique which estimates a catchment flood record on an event basis. The model uses estimates of the flood generating storm and the antecedent conditions to estimate a flow magnitude. The modelled flood record is then transformed into a flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curve</b> using an appropriate statistical method. Extensive testing of the model has assessed its robustness to the length of flood record used in fitting and its sensitivity to the input climate data. Several case studies using the UKCP weather generator show how the method works as well as providing an indication of how future climate changes may affect the flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curve.</b> The <b>frequency</b> <b>curve</b> mapping method developed here performs best on catchments whose flood regime is driven by rainfall. The use of a simple antecedent rainfall accounting method has been shown to perform as well as a quasi-physical soil moisture estimation method. The research undertaken offers several possibilities to develop understanding of flood <b>frequency</b> <b>curves</b> in catchments with short gauged records.
