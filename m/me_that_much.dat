500|$|At the {{beginning}} of [...] "Fighter", the guitar sound was arranged in the chord progression of Em [...] G/D [...] D [...] C [...] Em/B [...] B [...] Am [...] C/G [...] G [...] B7. Aguilera speaks the lyrics, [...] "After all you put me through, you'd think I'd despise you / But in the end, I wanna thank you, 'cause you made <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> stronger" [...] on the guitar theme by Dave Navarro. Lyrically, Aguilera wants to thank {{the man who did}} her wrong rather than insult him, because he helped make her stronger and work harder, thus making her a fighter. At the chorus, she sings, [...] "'Cause it makes <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> stronger/ Makes me work a little bit harder/ Makes <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> wiser/ So thanks for making me a fighter". The chords in the guitar part are E5 – F5 – G5 – A5 – B5 − C5 – B5 – A5 – G5 – F5 [...] E5. She continues, [...] "Made me learn a little bit faster/ Made my skin a little bit thicker/ Makes <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> smarter/ So thanks for making me a fighter". The lyrics of [...] "Fighter" [...] have been recognized as [...] "empowering".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Times, she commented, [...] "I'm very lucky they offered me the chance to follow my dreams, but also {{to allow me to}} produce my own album, which is hardly ever offered to first-time artists. He believes in <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>much.</b> I'm really blessed ... It's the most incredible gift that Mr Gibson could have given me." [...] She acknowledged to the Herald Sun that it was helpful to have Gibson's production company assist with her music career, [...] "If you think about it, every talent needs a serious push and help from somebody who is stronger, because it's pretty much impossible for anybody to succeed in this industry. So I've become very lucky, and I'm very grateful. You don't control the situations or the people you meet. I did not plan this. I'm just doing what I've always been doing. It's not like I've changed my goals at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It {{certainly}} {{is one of}} the real disappointments in my career. We had the players to do it. We just didn't get it done and I'm the one that must answer for that. But I do think it was a growing period in my life where I learned what it takes. And maybe not winning one kept <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> more hungry when we came over to Bolles." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I look at {{the wall}} because {{conscience}} tells <b>me</b> <b>that</b> too <b>much</b> weakness for thee is about to draw me astray from duty. What thou takest for deceit is only shame and modesty." ...|$|R
60|$|The Officer {{in charge}} {{informed}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> there is <b>much</b> {{need for a}} Maternity Hospital in Liverpool.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} is just as well to be {{interested}} in things as long as you live," [...] she had said. [...] "If you're not, it doesn't seem to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> there's <b>much</b> difference between the quick and the dead." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{design team}} {{included}} {{not only the}} architect William Hosking, but also the botanist and nurseryman George Loddiges. [...] Moreover, the ethos of Abney Park Cemetery was distinctly botanical. The plans for the chapel therefore featured a nearby rosarium {{and a collection of}} American plants on the Chapel Lawn. [...] This, combined with the unusual A to Z arboretum around the cemetery's perimeter, the pre-existing 'stately timber' or 'well timbered grounds' that included some early introductions of trees from North America from around 1700, and the plans for special interest tree collections along some of the northern and central walks, led John Loudon to describe Abney Park Cemetery as the most ornamented of the London cemeteries. [...] This attention to an educational and botanical interest in landscape design was becoming fashionable through the work of John Loudon and his ideas of the 'gardenesque'. However, no garden cemetery in Europe had ventured to adopt this style to the degree it was employed at Abney Park. [...] As Brent Elliot wrote in his [...] "Garden History" [...] journal review of a reprint of Loudon's book on cemetery design (1843;1981 reprint), [...] "It seems to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> of what Loudon recommends is drawn from the example of Abney Park Cemetery".|$|E
60|$|Yet {{it seems}} to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> credit is also due to another {{regiment}} whose name did not appear in brigade orders, and whose very existence {{is in danger of}} being forgotten.|$|E
6000|$|After felling <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> Fyne sat {{helpless}} in unconclusive agony. Going to bed {{was out of}} the question--neither {{could any}} steps be taken just then. What to do with himself he did not know! ...|$|E

5000|$|Touted as the [...] "Barack Obama of Brooklyn” {{during his}} {{run for the}} congressional seat, Jeffries has said he doesn’t see the Obama comparison. “Other {{than the fact that}} we were both born on August 4, it’s not clear to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> there’s <b>much</b> of a {{professional}} resemblance,” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{does not}} seem to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> we are <b>much</b> better off than we were before, so far as finding the path lies. What do you think?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, the pay. If I'm {{a detective}} fifty years, I'll make an easy two {{thousand}} a year. That's a round hundred thousand. Can you pay <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> to risk my future {{career as a}} detective?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} told me, {{in case we}} met, not to {{recognize}} you," [...] continued Mary Louise, [...] "but I'm so anxious for news, dear! Can't you come home, to-night, {{and have a good}} talk with me? You owe <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> consideration. Josie." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{numbers will}} run from twenty to thirty pages of my manuscript. You can give <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>much,</b> can you not? It is a howling good tale--at least these first four numbers are; {{the end is}} a trifle more fantastic, but 'tis all picturesque.|$|E
30|$|Intended for both: He annoyed <b>me</b> so <b>much</b> <b>that</b> I didn’t want {{to write}} the letter.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's <b>me</b> <b>that</b> wouldn't give <b>much</b> for his flesh," [...] {{observed}} Briant; [...] "but {{his skin}} and bones would fetch a good price in the leather and rag market." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Basil," [...] said Dorian, [...] "what {{have you}} told <b>me?</b> Simply <b>that</b> you felt <b>that</b> you admired <b>me</b> too <b>much.</b> <b>That</b> {{is not even a}} compliment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "These {{words were}} marked for my benefit--this {{is what she}} thinks of me --her own daughter--because I cannot agree with her in {{everything}} she believes!" [...] And here she flung the volume disdainfully on the grass. [...] "When I agreed to be your teacher I never imagined that such things would have been put into your head. Her anxiety about your spiritual welfare made it seem right in her eyes to do so, I suppose. But I should not have harmed you, my dear girl, or interfered with your religion in any way; she might have given <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> credit. When she knew how lonely my life was, and how much your affection {{would have been to}} me, it was unkind of her to set you also against me from the first." ...|$|E
60|$|The Staffordshire man came, and {{the former}} workmen looked very bitter on him. After a meeting, in which the {{minority}} made many vehement objections, Eustace addressed the workmen in the yards--that is to say, he thought he did; but Harold and Mr. Yolland made his meaning more apparent. A venture in finer workmanship, imitating Etruscan ware, was to be made, and, if successful, would much increase trade and profits, and a rise in wages was offered to such as could undertake the workmanship. Moreover, it was held out {{to them that they}} might become the purchasers of shares or half shares at the market price, and thus have an interest in the concern, whereat they sneered as at some new dodge of the Company for taking them in. It did not seem to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> was done, save making Harry pore over books and accounts, and run his hands through his hair, till his thick curls stood up in all directions.|$|E
60|$|Who {{fired the}} place I never learnt. It {{may have been}} the Basutos, or Marnham's body-servant, or Footsack, or a spark from the kitchen fire. At any rate it blazed merrily enough {{notwithstanding}} the marble walls, as a wood-lined and thatched building of course would do. On the whole I suspected the boy, who may very well have feared lest he should be accused of having had a hand in his master's death. At least it was gone, and watching the distant flames I bethought me that with it went all Heda's past. Twenty-four hours before her father was alive, the bondservant of Rodd and a criminal. Now he was ashes and Rodd was dead, while she and the man she loved were free, with all the world before them. I wished that I could have added that they were safe. Afterwards she told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> the same ideas passed through her own mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then why don't you act as {{my friend}} rather than his? Why don't you take my part? It seems to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> you are <b>much</b> more his {{daughter}} than my wife." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; I {{see it now}} I am with Aunt Melicent. You put so {{many more}} {{thoughts}} in my head, and showed <b>me</b> <b>that</b> so <b>much</b> more was good and wholesome than I used to fancy. Dear mamma once said you were educating me; and I hope to go on, and not let your lessons waste away.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop, {{my young}} namesake," [...] he eagerly cried, {{when he found}} that the sailor was about to make an effort to drag his own body up the cliff; [...] "stop; that will never do; let Dutton and <b>me</b> do <b>that</b> <b>much</b> for you, at least. We have seen all that has passed, and are now able to do something." ...|$|R
60|$|With {{regard to}} some {{particular}} passages which {{on the first}} night's representation seemed generally disliked, I confess, that if I felt any emotion of surprise at the disapprobation, {{it was not that}} they were disapproved of, but that I had not before perceived that they deserved it. As some part of the attack on the piece was begun too early to pass for the sentence of judgment, which is ever tardy in condemning, it has been suggested to <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> of the disapprobation must have arisen from virulence of malice, rather than severity of criticism: but as I was more apprehensive of there being just grounds to excite the latter than conscious of having deserved the former, I continue not to believe that probable, which I am sure must have been unprovoked. However, if it was so, and I could even mark the quarter from whence it came, it would be ungenerous to retort: for no passion suffers more than malice from disappointment. For my own part, I see no reason why the author of a play should not regard a first night's audience as a candid and judicious friend attending, in behalf of the public, at his last rehearsal. If he can dispense with flattery, he is sure at least of sincerity, and even though the annotation be rude, he may rely upon the justness of the comment. Considered in this light, that audience, whose fiat is essential to the poet's claim, whether his object be fame or profit, has surely a right to expect some deference to its opinion, from principles of politeness at least, if not from gratitude.|$|E
60|$|But, {{to proceed}} to other enormities: Every person who walks the streets, must needs observe the immense number of human {{excrements}} at the doors and steps of waste houses, and {{at the sides of}} every dead wall; for which the disaffected party have assigned a very false and malicious cause. They would have it, that these heaps were laid there privately by British fundaments, to make the world believe, that our Irish vulgar do daily eat and drink; and, consequently, that the clamour of poverty among us, must be false, proceeding only from Jacobites and Papists. They would confirm this, by pretending to observe, that a British anus being more narrowly perforated than one of our own country; and many of these excrements upon a strict view appearing copple crowned, with a point like a cone or pyramid, are easily distinguished from the Hibernian, which lie much flatter, and with lest continuity. I communicated this conjecture to an eminent physician, who is well versed in such profound speculations; and at my request was pleased to make trial with each of his fingers, by thrusting them into the anus of several persons of both nations, and professed he could find no such difference between them as those ill-disposed people allege. On the contrary, he assured <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> the greater number of narrow cavities were of Hibernian origin. This I only mention to shew how ready the Jacobites are to lay hold of any handle to express their malice against the government. I had almost forgot to add, that my friend the physician could, by smelling each finger, distinguish the Hibernian excrement from the British, and was not above twice mistaken in an hundred experiments; upon which he intends very soon to publish a learned dissertation.|$|E
60|$|But secondly, {{it is to}} {{be noted}} that it is neither by us uncertainable what moments of pure feeling or {{aspiration}} may occur to men of minds apparently cold and lost, nor by us to be pronounced through what instruments, and in what strangely occurrent voices, God may choose to communicate good to men. It seems to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> of what is great, and to all men beneficial, has been wrought by those who neither intended nor knew the good they did, and that many mighty harmonies have been discoursed by instruments that had been dumb or discordant, but that God knew their stops. The Spirit of Prophecy consisted with the avarice of Balaam, and the disobedience of Saul. Could we spare from its page that parable, which he said, who saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open, though we know that the sword of his punishment was then sharp in its sheath beneath him in the plains of Moab? or shall we not lament with David over the shield cast away on the Gilboa mountains, of him to whom God gave another heart that day when he turned his back to go from Samuel? It is not our part to look hardly, nor to look always, to the character or the deeds of men, but to accept from all of them, and to hold fast that which we can prove good, and feel to be ordained for us. We know that whatever good there is in them is itself divine, and wherever we see the virtue of ardent labor and self-surrendering to a single purpose, wherever we find constant reference made to the written scripture of natural beauty, this at least we know is great and good, this we know is not granted by the counsel of God, without purpose, nor maintained without result: Their interpretation we may accept, into their labor we may enter, but they themselves must look to it, if what they do has no intent of good, nor any reference to the Giver of all gifts. Selfish in their industry, unchastened in their wills, ungrateful for the Spirit that is upon them, they may yet be helmed by that Spirit whithersoever the Governor listeth; involuntary instruments they may become of others' good; unwillingly they may bless Israel, doubtingly discomfit Amalek, but shortcoming there will be of their glory, and sure, of their punishment.|$|E

60|$|He {{answered}} in an enigmatic sentence which impressed <b>me</b> so <b>much</b> <b>that</b> I find I entered it verbatim in my notebook.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{he said to}} his companion, {{who showed}} not the {{slightest}} disposition to leave his side, [...] "it don't seem to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> there's <b>much</b> worth repeating about poor Fynes,--much that I knew, at any rate. Still, if you like to get in a cab with me and ride as far as the Savoy, I'll tell you what I can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I tell you, Boston's full of 'em," [...] he said excitedly. [...] "One of 'em {{come up to}} me just now, {{and says}} he, 'Seems to me I've seen you before, but I can't place you.' 'Oh yes,' says I, 'I'll tell you where it was. I {{happened}} to be in the police court one morning when they was sendin' you up for three months.' I tell you he got round the corner! Might 'a' played checkers on his coat tail. Why, what do you suppose would been the next thing if I hadn't have let him know I saw through him?" [...] demanded the young man of Barker, who listened to this adventure with imperfect intelligence. [...] "He'd 'a' said, 'Hain't I seen you down Kennebunk way som'eres?' And when I said, 'No, I'm from Leominster!' or where-ever I was from if I was green, he'd say, 'Oh yes, so it was Leominster. How's the folks?' and he'd try to get me to think that he was from Leominster too; and then he'd want me to go off and see the sights with him; and pretty soon he'd meet a feller that 'ud dun him for that money he owed him; and he'd say he hadn't got anything with him but a cheque for forty dollars; and the other feller'd say he'd got to have his money, and he'd kind of insinuate it was all a put-up job about the cheque for forty dollars, anyway; and that 'ud make the first feller mad, and he'd take out the check, and ask him what he thought o' that; and the other feller'd say, well, it was a good cheque, but it wan't money, and he wanted money; and then the first feller'd say, 'Well, come along to the bank and get your money,' and the other'd say the bank was shut. 'Well, then,' the first feller'd say, 'well, sir, I ain't a-goin' to ask any favour of you. How much is your bill?' and the other feller'd say ten dollars, or fifteen, or may be twenty-five, if they thought I had that much, and the first feller'd say, 'Well, here's a gentleman from up my way, and I guess he'll advance <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> on my cheque if I make it worth his while. He knows me.' And the first thing you know--he's been treatin' you, and so polite, showin' you round, and ast you to go to the theayter--you advance the money, and you keep on with the first feller, and pretty soon he asks you to hold up a minute, he wants to go back and get a cigar; and he goes round the corner, and you hold up, and hold up, and in about a half an hour, or may be less time, you begin to smell a rat, and you go for a policeman, and the next morning you find your name in the papers, 'One more unfortunate!' You look out for 'em, young feller! Wish I had let that one go on till he done something so I could handed him over to the cops. It's a shame they're allowed to go 'round, when the cops knows 'em. Hello! There comes my mate, now." [...] The young man spoke as if they had been talking of his mate and expecting him, and another young man, his counterpart in dress, but of a sullen and heavy demeanour very unlike his own brisk excitement, approached, flapping a bank-note in his hand. [...] "I just been tellin' this young feller about that beat, you know." ...|$|E
