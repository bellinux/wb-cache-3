40|$|There are a {{significant}} number of microwave applications, including active antenna arrays, wireless communication systems, navigational applications, etc., where improvement of such qualities as manufacturing costs, size, weight, power consumption, etc. is still on the agenda of today’s RF design. In order to meet these requirements, new technologies must be actively involved in fabrication of RF components with improved characteristics. One of such fabrication technologies is called LIGA, used before primarily in fluidics, photonics, bioengineering, and micromechanics, and only recently receiving growing attention in RF component fabrication. One of the RF components suffering limitations in performance due to limitations in fabrication capabilities is the compact single metal layer (SML) coupled-line 3 -dB coupler, also called “hybrid”, required in some applications thanks to its ability to divide power equally and electrically isolate the output from the input. In today’s practical edge-coupled SML coupler designs, the level of coupling is limited by the capabilities of the photolithographic process to print the coupled lines close enough for tight coupling and it is usually no tighter that 8 dB. A promising way to overcome this limitation is increasing the area of metallic interface of the coupled lines, thus increasing the mutual capacitance of the lines, and inherently the coupling between them. This should be preferably done with keeping the coupler compact with respect to the footprint area, which is attained by making taller conductors, i. e. employing the third dimension. In contrast with previously used RF component fabrication processes, LIGA is the technology that allows the designer to explore the third dimension and build tall conductors while being also able to use small features. When the two-dimensional edge-coupled SML couplers are extended into the three-dimensional structures, they rather become the side-coupled SML couplers. Tall-conductor coupled lines have been characterized in this work to reveal their dependence on their geometry and a 3 -dB SML coupler with tall conductors has been developed and fabricated using LIGA at the Institute for <b>Microstructure</b> <b>Technology</b> (IMT), Karlsruhe, Germany. The simulation and measurement results demonstrate the potentially superior performance of LIGA couplers, and the promising capabilities of LIGA for fabrication of RF microstructures...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{application}} of microstructures for heat exchangers and reactors in the gas treatment system of a fuel processing unit for mobile applications based on catalytic autothermal reforming of diesel-like fuels was experimentally and theoretically investigated. The experimental work involved simplified experimental setups and prototypes of microchannel heat exchangers. The theoretical part dealt with the fluid dynamic modelling of the transport phenomena that are relevant in microstructured and monolithic apparatus. The thermohydraulic characterisation of microchannels shows {{a sharp increase in}} the pressure drop if the characteristic length of the channels is reduced. The transition from laminar to turbulent flow occurs at lower Re-numbers than on a larger scale. The heat transfer coefficients improve, if the channel size is reduced, but this enhancement is less pronounced than the increasing pressure drop. Therefore very tiny structures are not optimal as far as heat exchanger equipment is concerned. The optimal size is in a range of approximately 0. 4 to 1 mm. The prototypes studied indicate the potential for reducing the weight and the volume of the required heat exchanger equipment by the incorporation of <b>microstructure</b> <b>technology.</b> However, for further optimisation {{there is a need for}} a thorough revision of the construction principle. Application-oriented, catalytic investigations were performed for all reactions in the gas treatment. The catalysts for the water-gas shift reaction show only a moderate catalytic activity. The catalyst based on precious metals is more active than a base metal catalyst, but lacks the required long-term stability if hydraulically coated on a metallic substrate. The catalyst used for the selective oxidation of CO shows a poor performance and a narrow temperature window for optimal reactor operation. The oxidation of hydrogen can be accomplished at high space velocities, low reaction temperatures or low loadings with catalytically active component. For the oxidation of methane longer residence times, higher reaction temperatures and higher loadings with catalytically active component are needed if complete conversion of methane is required. A platinum-based catalyst is very well suited for the catalytic combustion of hydrogen. In the case of methane, the palladium-based catalyst tested is more active in comparison to the platinum catalyst. For all reactions under consideration here conversion at constant reaction temperature increases if the channel size is reduced. The comparison of experimental data with results of computer simulations shows that fluid dynamic modelling can be used for dimensioning and optimisation of micro reactors and heat exchangers concerning all relevant figures such as pressure drop, heat transfer and chemical reactions. The model for mass transport by mulitcomponent diffusion, which differentiates between the channel and the porous catalyst layer, is suitable for describing the relevant transport phenomena. None of the catalysts under consideration in this thesis are active enough to justify an integration of a heat exchanger into a reactor of the gas treatment system of fuel processors for mobile applications. This can be shown by simulation results and experimental data...|$|E

40|$|The {{field of}} {{material}} structuring is wide and diverse. Historically, this blooming ample field first sparked {{with the emergence}} of man, who has evolved over the ages of civilization through shaping materials. Today, this field encompasses processes and techniques capable of providing products of high quality that meet both the simplest and the most complex needs of our modern daily life. Through all stages of technological progress, man sought the way to make best use of materials by structuring them to emphasize their properties, as nature itself did to evolve its self-ordered structure. In the last decades, a new great range of structuring technologies have been developed to provide and to exploit combinations of properties, enabling for entirely new devices to be made or quite new effects to be achieved. This colorful scenario of potential applications is further widened by remarkable and, sometimes, unpredictable phenomena arising from scaling down structuring technologies to the micrometer and nanometer scale. Micro and nanofabrication, in fact, are increasingly central in modern science, industry and technology for reasons spanning from empowering Microelectronics mass-production, to providing fast and portable diagnostic tools, to allowing multifunctionality integration into the same device. In this work, the integration of novel and avant-garde polymer, silicon and composite materials <b>microstructuring</b> <b>technologies</b> is used for the fabrication of microstructures and microsystems suitable {{for a wide range of}} applications, ranging from the fields of Microfluidics and Biosensing, to Micro Electromechanical Systems (MEMS), to Microtagging, and Sensing. In particular, the design, fabrication, characterization, and preliminary testing of an SU- 8 on-glass microfluidic platform for multi-analyte optical detection is reported. SU- 8 is a photosensitive polymer that has recently gained prominence for its easy processing by standard photolithography, allowing for the fabrication of high-aspect-ratio structures with nearly vertical sidewall. Upon definition and optimization of a proper structuring protocol with resolution of ~ 5 μm, on both silicon and glass, the designed microfluidic platform was successfully fabricated and tested. Silicon is the most used substrate for MEMS fabrication by standard photolithographic techniques. In this work, the design, simulation and fabrication of a high-aspect-ratio all-silicon in-plane optical accelerometer by silicon Electrochemical Micromachining (ECM) technology is reported. Electrochemical Micromachining (ECM) is a novel wet etching technology based on the controlled electrochemical dissolution of silicon in Hydrofluoric Acid (HF) -based aqueous solutions allowing for high-aspect-ratio and for high-complexity microsystem fabrication in any lab at low cost. In the reference frame of silicon <b>microstructuring</b> <b>technologies,</b> moreover, the fabrication by back-side illumination electrochemical etching (BIEE) at high anodic voltage of ordered macropore arrays featuring spatial periods of 2 μm and submicrometric size is successfully achieved and reported. This result could represent the first step toward low-doped n-type silicon nanofabrication at low HF concentration by BIEE. Integrating both silicon and polymer <b>microstructuring</b> <b>technologies,</b> a high-yield (> 95 %) top-down parallel and facile polymer structuring technique for the fabrication of two-dimensional (2 D) arrays of micrometric-sized (down to ~ 3 μm 2) polymeric freestanding membranes integrated into microstructured silicon is demonstrated by drop-casting technology. The technique versatility is proved by reporting the successful fabrication of 2 D membrane arrays arranged in either regular or non-regular patterns, using both conjugated and non-conjugated polymers, and their application for Microtagging is detailed. Conjugated polymers have been widely investigated over the last decades for their unique optical and semiconducting properties, although their use for hybrid polymer/silicon microstructured platforms has been somehow overlooked. Finally, the design, fabrication, characterization, and preliminary testing of luminescent porous silicon-polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composite micropillar arrays for oxygen sensing applications is reported in the last section. Luminescent porous silicon is shown to quench upon exposure to molecular oxygen, though suffering from permanent loss of sensing capabilities and drift in the baseline due to photo-oxidation. The concept of this work relies upon the use of a composite material embedding luminescent porous silicon in a PDMS matrix in order to exploit quenching of porous silicon luminescence for oxygen sensing, PDMS as both a baseline-drift-stabilizer and an oxygen-permeable substrate, and micropillar array structure for the high surface area and the sensitivity-enhancing waveguide effect...|$|R
