Motivated by these results, we analytically and computationally investigate the combined effects of seal length and compressibility on the <b>maximum</b> <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> a seal can support. We present a Saint-Venant type analytic shear lag solution for slightly compressible seals with large aspect ratios, which compares well with nonlinear finite element simulations in regions far from the ends of the seal. However, at the high- and low-pressure ends, where fracture is observed experimentally, the analytic solution is in poor agreement with detailed finite element calculations. Nevertheless, we show that the analytic solution provides far-field stress measures that correlate, over a range of aspect ratios and bulk moduli, the calculated energy release rates for the growth of small cracks at the two ends of the seal. Thus a single finite element simulation coupled with the analytic solution can be used to determine tendencies for fracture at the two ends of the seal over a wide range of geometry and compressibility. Finally, using a hypothetical critical energy release rate, predictions for whether a crack on the high-pressure end will begin to grow before or after a crack on the low-pressure end begins to grow are made using the analytic solution and compared with finite element simulations for finite deformation, hyperelastic seals...|$|E
40|$|The Los Alamos Controlled Air Incinerator (CAI) is {{a system}} {{designed}} to accept radioactive mixed waste containing alpha-emitting radionuclides. A mathematical model was developed to predict the pressure response throughout the offgas treatment system of the CAI during three hypothetical incident scenarios. The scenarios examined included: (1) loss of burner flame and failure of the flame safeguard system with subsequent reignition of fuel gas in the primary chamber, (2) pyrolytic gas buildup from a waste package due to loss of induced draft and subsequent restoration of induced draft, and (3) accidental charging of propellant spray cans in a solid waste package to the primary chamber during a normal feed cycle. For {{each of the three}} scenarios, the finite element computer model was able to determine the transient pressure surge and decay response throughout the system. Of particular interest were the maximum absolute pressures attainable at critical points in the system as well as <b>maximum</b> <b>differential</b> <b>pressures</b> across the high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters.

40|$|Electro Hydro Dynamics (EHD) fluid {{is a kind}} of {{intelligent}} fluid. The fluid has the property that a fluid jet flow is generated between two electrodes when a high voltage is applied. DBDN (Di n-butyl dodecandioate) {{is a kind of}} EHD fluid and a dielectric organic liquid. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to develop a lightweight and compact fluid actuator which makes use of such properties of EHD fluid. We think that it is useful to apply EHD actuators to an industrial robot as a lightweight actuator. In order to develop such an actuator, we first investigated the characteristics, the relation between the generated pressure and applied voltage to DBDN fluid. In this study, we tested two kinds of pumping module; direct type and suction type. The direct type module consists of two doughnut shaped electrodes. The suction type module consists of a flat plate electrode and a cylindrical electrode. We investigated the relation between applied voltage and generated differential pressure using these modules. Further, we investigated the influence of geometric parameters on the characteristics of the module. As a result of the experiment, It was found that the suction type was able to generate much higher differential pressure, more than 320 times, compared with the direct type module. It was observed that the <b>maximum</b> <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> was 3. 6 kPa when the voltage of 10 kV was applied by using the one-stage suction type module.

40|$|Development of a metal media {{standard}} (FI) for ASME AG- 1 (Code on Nuclear Air and Gas Treatment) {{has been}} under way for almost ten years. This paper will provide {{a brief history of}} the development process of this section and a detailed overview of its current content/status. There have been at least two points when dramatic changes {{have been made in the}} scope of the document due to feedback from the full Committee on Nuclear Air and Gas Treatment (CONAGT). Development of the proposed section has required resolving several difficult issues associated with scope; namely, filtering efficiency, operating conditions (media velocity, pressure drop, etc.), qualification testing, and quality control/acceptance testing. A proposed version of Section FI is currently undergoing final revisions prior to being submitted for balloting. The section covers metal media filters of filtering efficiencies ranging from medium (less than 99. 97 %) to high (99. 97 % and greater). Two different types of high efficiency filters are addressed; those units intended to be a direct replacement of Section FC fibrous glass HEPA filters and those that will be placed into newly designed systems capable of supporting greater static pressures and differential pressures across the filter elements. Direct replacements of FC HEPA filters in existing systems will be required to meet equivalent qualification and testing requirements to those contained in Section FC. A series of qualification and quality assurance test methods have been identified for the range of filtering efficiencies covered by this proposed standard. Performance characteristics of sintered metal powder vs. sintered metal fiber media are dramatically different with respect to parameters like differential pressures and rigidity of the media. Wide latitude will be allowed for owner specification of performance criteria for filtration units that will be placed into newly designed systems. Such allowances will permit use of the most appropriate metal media for a system as specified by the owner with respect to material of manufacture, media velocity, system maximum static pressure, <b>maximum</b> <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> across the filter, and similar parameters...|$|E
5000|$|All {{exhaust air}} is dumped to {{atmosphere}} via an outflow valve, usually {{at the rear}} of the fuselage. This valve controls the cabin pressure and also acts as a safety relief valve, in addition to other safety relief valves. If the automatic pressure controllers fail, the pilot can manually control the cabin pressure valve, according to the backup emergency procedure checklist. The automatic controller normally maintains the proper cabin pressure altitude by constantly adjusting the outflow valve position so that the cabin altitude is as low as practical without exceeding the <b>maximum</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> limit on the fuselage. The <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> varies between aircraft types, typical values are between [...] and [...] At 39000 ft, the cabin pressure would be automatically maintained at about 6900 ft (450 ft lower than Mexico City), which is about [...] of atmosphere pressure.|$|R

Therefore, an air brake system can use a much smaller brake cylinder than a vacuum system to generate the same braking force. This advantage of air brakes increases at high altitude, e.g. Peru and Switzerland where today vacuum brakes are used by secondary railways. The much higher effectiveness of air brakes and {{the demise of the}} steam locomotive have seen the air brake become ubiquitous; however, vacuum braking is still in use in India, in Argentina and in South Africa, but this will be declining in near future.|$|R

With the cabin structure sealed, cabin air was dumped overboard at a controlled rate through a dump valve and replaced with oxygen, from storage bottles, maintaining oxygen levels roughly constant.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedWind loads on sun tracking solar reflector panels {{exposed to the}} atmospheric boundary layer were established through surface static pressure measurements to determine how wind affects them, specifically {{at the request of}} SPAWAR-Pacific, which has developed a custom design. A 1 : 8 scale model of a four-panel array was studied in the Naval Postgraduate School wind tunnel. Wind velocity, wind angle orientation, and individual panel positions, at which the highest pressure coefficient cases were anticipated, were varied. The pressure coefficients were measured by an array of Scanivalve pressure transducers with 16 pressure taps drilled into the top and bottom surfaces of each panel. Oil flow and smoke flow visualization techniques were performed to better understand the flow features that led to the greatest pressure coefficients. A parapet was included to observe the wind effects of various positions. Additionally, pressure measurements were observed using a rounded edge installed on the lead panel edges. This notion was to assist in not only minimizing wind loads, but also in determining a safe stow position of the array during high wind events. The measurements and the flow visualization studies both provided a cohesive and constructive picture of the flow. The windward panel was found to be subjected to the thrust of the wind loads in most cases, with a <b>maximum</b> recorded <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> coefficient of 3. 25. However, when in combination with attaching the rounded edge to the windward panel and setting it negative five degrees, pressure coefficients were decreased by more than 70 %.

40|$|Wind-induced {{pressure}} {{differences over}} rain screens {{are determined by}} the external pressures and the pressures inside the cavity. Minimizing this pressure difference decreases the risk of water leakage and also helps to minimize the local loads on the façade elements. Current rules to determine the wind loads on such structures are based on very little experimental evidence. Some guidance using very crude rules is given in EN 1991 - 1 - 4 [1]. A full scale measurement has been set up on a 158 m high residential building situated in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. The façade is clad with slabs of natural stone, which typically have a size of 1 m 2 each. The openings between the elements are about 10 mm wide and the air cavity has a depth of (nominally) 20 mm. At a height of approximately 120 m above the ground, the façade elements have been equipped with 40 pressure transducers: 20 for the external pressure and 20 for the cavity pressure. From this experiment pressure equalization coefficients per pressure tap have been derived, which are defined as the <b>maximum</b> peak <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> coefficients divided by the maximum peak external pressure coefficients. Also wind direction dependent values have been derived. For overpressure, a pressure equalization coefficient of 0. 6 has been found, which is comparable to the ratio EN 1991 - 1 - 4 gives for the net pressure coefficient of an permeable façade (cp,net= 2 / 3 cpe). For underpressure, values in the same order of magnitude have been found, with a maximum value of 0. 8 in the middle zone. One value above 1 has been found, which lies in a corner zone (ceq= 1. 1). The measured pressure equalization coefficients for underpressure are higher than the net pressure coefficients in EN 1991 - 1 - 4 for permeable facades (cp,net= 1 / 3 cpe) ...|$|R

Firstly, {{the location of the}} transient <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor is optimized to obtain high amplitude signals and good linearity in Strouhal number. Empirical mode decomposition method in combination with autocorrelation decay is successfully employed at high Reynolds numbers to identify the vortex shedding frequency in presence of hydrodynamic noise. The performance of the <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor deteriorates significantly under disturbed flow conditions at low Reynolds number due to the presence of low frequency components. This deterioration in the signal quality limits the lower operating range of the flowmeter with <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor.
