The aim {{of this study was to}} determine key factors to promote increased life of swimmers which currently fail mostly by <b>metal</b> <b>pick-up.</b> There was insufficient data to build mathematical models for swimmer failure; it is recommended that systematic data collection take place using statistical quality control principles...|$|E
40|$|PVD {{coatings}} such as TiN and CrN {{have been}} successfully applied to metal forming industries for their advanced wear resistance, <b>Metal</b> <b>pick-up</b> and sticking problems in certain deep drawing and plastic injection molding processes, however, demand more sophisticated tribological thin films. In this study, we evaluated chromium carbide coatings synthesized by PVD processes for potential applications in forming and molding operations. We deposited Cr 3 C 2 thin films of 3 mu m thickness using both cathodic are evaporation and unbalanced magnetron sputtering to ensure superior adhesion strength at the film-substrate interface. Using X-ray diffraction(XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) /electron desorption spectroscopy(EDS), Vicker's microhardness, and wear tests, we studied the influences of deposition parameters on microstructure and mechanical properties. Our results indicated that Cr 3 C 2 outperforms hard chrome plating and CrN coatings in measures of sliding wear resistance and ease of mold release. We attributed Cr 3 C 2 's performance to its process-improved microhardness and low surface energy. In sum, we found Cr 3 C 2 coatings to be highly promising for tribological applications at low-to-medium temperatures. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S. A. All rights reserved...|$|E

A <b>pick-up</b> cod is spaced apart from the drive coil {{along the length of the}} metal tube. The pick@up coil is positioned with one end thereof lying adjacent the wall of the metal tube such that the pick-up coil's longitudinal axis is perpendicular to the wall of the metal tube. To isolate the pick-up coil from the magnetic flux of the drive coil and the flux from the induced eddy currents. except the eddy currents diverted by a longitudinal flaw. an electrically conducting material high in magnetic permeability surrounds all of the pick-up coil except its one end that is adjacent the walls of the metal tube. The electrically conducting material can extend into and through the drive coil in a coaxial relationship therewith...|$|R
40|$|Thin silicon chips with a {{thickness}} of 50 m are of light weight {{and are able}} to swim on droplets of fluids like for instance water. If the liquid shows a specific wetting behavior with respect to the underlying substrate then droplet and chip can move and self-align. Recent research work was carried out to determine the self-alignment accuracy of 50 m thin silicon dies on plasma programmed surfaces. The self-alignment process sequence for die assembly comprise the following steps: surface programming by CF 4 plasma treatment, dispense droplets of water on the <b>metal</b> target areas, <b>pick-up</b> of a 50 m thin chip, move chip tool above the selected target area, let the chip fall down and self-align on the liquid surface on the target area. Within short time the droplet dries off and then the thin die sticks to the substrate. Self-alignment accuracy was measured by infrared microscopy at the position of the alignment marks of top and bottom devices. The paper will report in detai l about sample preparation, selective plasma programming, self-alignment accuracy of thin dies and its dependence of the die size. Furthermore, the chemical composition of the relevant surfaces after CF 4 plasma activation were analysed by XPS measurements...|$|R
40|$|Full text of {{this item}} is not {{currently}} {{available on the}} LRA. The final published version is available at [URL] Doi: 10. 1088 / 0957 - 4484 / 19 / 50 / 505602 A novel method for the synthesis of nanostructured films produced by depositing gas-phase magnetic nanoparticles is presented and {{the properties of the}} films are reported. The technique mixes metal vapour and small argon clusters produced in a supersonic expansion. The condensed clusters are subsequently deposited in situ onto copper grids. The cluster size is controlled by the vapour pressure of the <b>metal</b> inside the <b>pick-up</b> chamber. Detailed analysis of the transmission electron micrographs of the Fe clusters shows that there is a simple linear relationship between the average metal cluster diameter and the metal vapour pressure during deposition. Furthermore, the nanoparticles show a relatively narrow size distribution for a given set of experimental conditions. Structural and magnetic investigations have been performed on Fe cluster samples, and the influence of the metal vapour pressure has been studied. Detailed analysis of the magnetic and structural data has been performed and valuable information such as cluster size distributions, strength of the interparticle dipolar interactions and average magnetic moment per cluster are derived. It is shown that, at room temperature, the magnetic behaviour of the films is consistent with nanoparticle supermoments interacting via dipolar interactions...|$|R
40|$|Beer, as manufactured, {{is not at}} {{chemical}} equilibrium and undergoes complex {{chemical reactions}} during storage {{which can lead to}} undesirable changes in the sensory characteristics of beer. Since beer contains more than 600 volatile compounds, beer flavour change is a complex field of research and the dependable prediction of shelf life remains a top research priority. Chapter 1 places the work described in this thesis into this context. Chapters 2 and 3 provide details of the experimental methods used and their development, respectively, to evaluate flavour stability. The methods used and developed include: (i) the determination of one of the major antioxidants present in beer, sulphur dioxide (SO 2), via distillation; (ii) a solid phase micro extraction (SPME) -GC-MS method with on fibre derivatization as a reliable detection method for aldehydes related to off flavours perceived in aged beer; (iii) measurement of the oxidative stability using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Chapter 4 describes oxidative stability measurements via EPR spectroscopy for three different lager-style beer qualities pre- and post-filtration. The trial included a large scale Kieselguhr frame filter, and two pilot-scale membrane filtration system. The results illustrate how EPR spectroscopy is sensitive to <b>metal</b> ion <b>pick-up</b> from traditional filter media and oxidative stability measures were evaluated versus oxygen pick up during filtration and sulphur dioxide content of the beer samples. The effect of a brewhouse addition of gallotannins on the flavour stability of a lager-style beer was investigated in Chapter 5. Pilot scale (16 hl) and large scale production line (1500 hl) experiments with gallotannins additions in the Brewhouse were performed. The effects of the different additions were monitored at key points of the production process and through to the final beer. Despite showing significant improvements in the pilot scale wort samples, the results for the related packed beer samples did not show clear flavour stability improvements. For the production-scale trials, only a very limited effect of improved flavour stability could be observed. In Chapter 6 a factorial experimental design was adopted to probe the interactions between seven factors known to impact on beer flavour stability. Chemical additions were made to a bright beer prior to bottling, to vary the following factors: total in pack oxygen, SO 2, total iron, iso-α-acid and α-acid content, (+) -catechin and glutathione. Increased SO 2 concentrations had the largest impact across the entire design space, resulting in reduced radical formation, staling aldehyde concentrations and improved sensory scores. The impacts of increased TIPO levels were rather limited. In contrast, a significant impact regarding the oxidative stability could be observed for increasing Fe concentration, highlighting the significance of pro-oxidative effects of transition metals...|$|R
