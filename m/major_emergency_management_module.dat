40|$|This study asks if a {{strategic}} {{approach to the}} management of communication can assist and support the overall operational commander in effectively managing a <b>major</b> <b>emergency</b> situation. Communication in this regard includes important strategictactical functions that need consideration when the community faces significant loss of life or damage, and incorporates tasks such as media management, public information, the raising of public awareness, internal communication, public affairs, community relations, and survivor and victim relations. Encompassing these functions {{are a number of}} overarching principles that, when adopted, allow the entire process to be approached from {{a strategic}} rather than a tactical viewpoint. The study demonstrates how an efficient, strategically focused communication team can assist the operational commander in managing a <b>major</b> <b>emergency</b> situation. The dissertation explores principles and practices for strategic communication <b>management</b> for <b>major</b> <b>emergencies.</b> It recommends a particular framework that is underpinned by six strategic communication principles. The framework was developed taking into account relevant theories and models of strategic communication and management, augmented by detailed primary and secondary qualitative deductive research. Research in this regard included reading not only the academic literature but also a broad range of official Irish and other documentation, including reports, manuals, guidance materials and legislation. Original primary research was undertaken to ascertain how a number of countries, regarded as leaders in this field, approach this subject and detailed interviews were conducted with responsible officials in Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. As relatively little data exists on the subject of <b>major</b> <b>emergency</b> strategic communication in the Irish context, in-depth interviews were also conducted with key individuals involved in <b>major</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> in Ireland. The study demonstrates that the strategic communication function is increasingly a critical success factor in <b>major</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> internationally. It also shows that, while <b>major</b> <b>emergency</b> communication initiatives have been undertaken in Ireland, the Irish approach is somewhat fragmented and tactical in nature...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Web-based {{learning}} (WBL) {{is increasingly}} used in medical education; however, residency training programs often lack guidance on its implementation. We describe how {{the use of}} feasibility studies can guide the use of WBL in anesthesia residency training. Methods. Two case-based WBL <b>emergency</b> airway <b>management</b> <b>modules</b> were developed for self-directed use by anesthesia residents. The feasibility of using this educational modality was assessed using a single cohort pretest/posttest design. Outcome measures included user recruitment and retention rate, perceptions of educational value, and knowledge improvement. The differences between pre- and postmodule test scores and survey Likert scores were analysed using the paired t test. Results. Recruitment and retention rates were 90 % and 65 %, respectively. User-friendliness of the modules was rated highly. There was a significant improvement in perceptions {{of the value of}} WBL in the postsurvey. There was a significant knowledge improvement of 29 % in the postmodule test. Conclusions. Feasibility studies can help guide appropriate use of WBL in curricula. While our study supported the potential feasibility of <b>emergency</b> airway <b>management</b> <b>modules</b> for training, collaboration with other anesthesia residency programs may enable more efficient development, implementation, and evaluation of this resource-intensive modality in anesthesia education and practice...|$|R
40|$|Local {{government}} organisations play {{a critical}} role in achieving community resilience to disasters. As part of their response capabilities most local governments operate an Emergency Operations Centre (EOC). EOCs function as the command and communication headquarters for planning and decision-making during a disaster or an emergency. This thesis has two research objectives. The first is to conduct preliminary exploratory research about how local government EOCs are used during preparedness activities. The second is to contribute information and recommendations that could better equip emergency managers to prepare for and respond to emergencies and disasters. The broad concepts and common terminology of contemporary <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> are introduced. Information about the jurisdictional terminology, frameworks, and the <b>major</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> organisations for New Zealand, Canada, and USA are discussed. Research was carried out using recent literature and the results of a questionnaire that 48 local government departments with EOCs participated in. This investigation was guided by seven research questions from three inter-related areas of investigation. They are EOC operation and activation, <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> training, and <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> decision making. Literature shows there is a growing realisation that many disaster preparedness practices are based largely upon anecdote and are lacking systematic study or objective validation. Results and conclusions presented in this thesis reveal local government organisations need and desire more information and support in operating their EOC, and in <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> training and decision making. What each individual organisation does by way of training and related assessment is unique to each organisation. Local government organisations are operating in blind faith that their preparedness activities are actually enhancing their response and recovery capabilities. Recommendations for future research and of where emergency managers should direct their attention during preparedness concludes this study. The research community needs to focus attention on local government <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> and the greater <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> community needs to support and guide local government <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> offices...|$|R
30|$|This {{article will}} {{maintain}} that selective <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> should be promptly changed to comprehensive <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> in Korea. In particular, comprehensive <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> {{has to be}} practiced at all levels in the near future. To systematically compare the two kinds of <b>emergency</b> <b>management,</b> the same three major components of both types of management, namely, a) stakeholders, b) the phases of the <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> lifecycle, and c) hazards and impacts, will be examined at all four analytical levels: 1) central government level, 2) industry level, 3) community level, and 4) household level.

40|$|With the {{frequent}} occurrence of <b>major</b> <b>emergencies,</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> gets high attention {{from all around}} the world. This paper investigates the comprehensive optimization of <b>major</b> <b>emergency</b> evacuation route and departure time, in which case the evacuation propagation mechanism is considered under traffic control. Given the practical assumptions, we first establish a comprehensive optimization model based on the simulation of evacuation route and departure time. Furthermore, we explore the reasonable description method of evacuation traffic flow propagation under traffic control, including the establishment of traffic flow propagation model and the design of the simulation mudule that can simulate the evacuation traffic flow. Finally, we propose a heuristic algorithm for the optimization of this comprehensive model. In case analysis, we take some areas in Beijing as the evaluation sources to verify the reliability of our model. A series of constructive suggestions for Beijing's emergency evacuation are proposed, which {{can be applied to the}} actual situation under traffic control...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The recent {{advances}} in geo-informatics have been opening new opportunities in earthquake early warning and <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> issues. In the last years, the geo-scientific community has recognized the added value of a geo-analytic approach in complex decision making processes for critical situations due to disastrous natural events such as earthquakes. In fact, recently, GIS-based solutions are investigated in several research projects such as SIT_MEW Project, aimed at the development of volcanic and seismic early warning systems (EWSs). In this project context, an innovative open source GIS system has been investigated and developed as integrated component of the seismic EWS. Its architecture consists in a geospatial database system, a local GIS application for analyzing and modelling the seismic event and its impacts and supporting post-event <b>emergency</b> <b>management,</b> a WEB-GIS <b>module</b> for sharing the geo-information among {{the public and private}} stakeholders and emergency managers involved in disaster impact assessment and response management...|$|R

40|$|Flood {{is one of}} {{the major}} natural {{disasters}} in Australia. It breaks down transportation and communication systems, disrupts businesses and causes damage to properties, loss of stock, crops and also loss of human lives. Better understanding of the impacts resulting from floods and other natural hazards can help to reduce the damages or losses. Flood damage assessment procedures estimate the impact of flood in monetary terms to help decision makers develop new policies, programs and development plans. This study examines different techniques, procedures and underpinning philosophies that have been used in some <b>major</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> and insurance organizations in the world such as RAM, ANUFLOOD, and HAZUS and NHRC. From this examination the study finds that none of them are suitable for mitigation and emergency purposes in producing economic flood damage estimation at fine resolution with high accuracy. From this perspective the study develops a rigorous procedure for property level economic flood damage assessment. The assessment procedures are embedded within GIS (Geographic Information System) technology which can model and analyse the multidimensional phenomenon of flood and damage characteristics of residential buildings. The damage estimation procedures developed in this study include flood modelling, collection and organisation of building inventory data; adopting a set of stage-damage curves; and measuring damage at property level. The quality of damage estimates derived from the procedures is highly influenced by quality of input data. The study also includes the implementation of the damage assessment procedure on the study area (a segment of Kororoit Creek and its adjacent area). The study uses data from a number of sources including Melbourne Water, NEXIS, VICMAP, a quick survey and literature. The developed procedure will help many practitioners in flood loss assessment and natural hazard risk management to face the challenges they have in establishing damage estimates with high accuracy...|$|R

40|$|<b>Emergency</b> <b>management</b> has {{developed}} separately in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland {{as a result}} of the differences in the political, legal, organisational and cultural backgrounds that exist in the two jurisdictions. Good cross-border cooperation has existed at individual organisational level between the principal emergency response agencies for many years. Now that regions in Europe are becoming more connected it is becoming increasingly obvious to agencies with responsibility for <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> on both sides of the border that we need to be better prepared and ready to work effectively together to deal with any <b>major</b> <b>emergency</b> that may arise along the border. Emergencies and natural or manmade disasters do not respect geographical borders, particularly on a landmass as small as the island of Ireland. It is recognised that there is a need for more formalised joint planning and greater collaboration by the statutory agencies, which will result in a more coordinated and effective response to any possible <b>major</b> <b>emergencies</b> or disasters that may occur along the border areas. This paper reviews the current <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> arrangements in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, how the structures, roles and responsibilities of the various agencies involved differ, and how a move to greater collaboration has occurred, as well as examining the drivers for this collaboration, how this has manifested itself so far, and how the potential for pragmatic, flexible and creative solutions will achieve further progress in the coming years...|$|R
5000|$|Preparedness {{refers to}} a very {{concrete}} research based set of actions that are taken as precautionary measures {{in the face of}} potential disasters. These actions can include both physical preparations (such as emergency supplies depots, adapting buildings to survive earthquakes and so on) and trainings for emergency action. Preparedness is an important quality in achieving goals and in avoiding and mitigating negative outcomes. There are different types of preparedness, such as public health preparedness and local emergency preparedness or snow preparedness (i.e.: Snow Preparedness Teams - SPT), but probably the most developed type is [...] "Disaster Preparedness", defined by the UN as involving [...] "forecasting and taking precautionary measures prior to an imminent threat when advance warnings are possible". [...] This includes not only natural disasters, but all kinds of severe damage caused in a relatively short period, including warfare.Preparedness is a <b>major</b> phase of <b>emergency</b> <b>management,</b> and is particularly valued in areas of competition such as sport and military science.|$|R

30|$|Two {{kinds of}} <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> are {{discussed}} in this article: selective <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> and comprehensive <b>emergency</b> <b>management.</b> They are opposite concepts {{in terms of the}} entire direction of <b>emergency</b> <b>management.</b> Selective <b>emergency</b> <b>management,</b> which is newly named here, is a traditional type, whereas comprehensive <b>emergency</b> <b>management,</b> which is being widely practiced, is a modern type (FEMA, 2010 b: 2.5 – 2.6; Zessin, 2006 : 8 – 9). An increasing number of organizations have tried to utilize comprehensive <b>emergency</b> <b>management,</b> but many still rely on selective <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> under their own limited environments.|$|R
30|$|The term ‘selective’ means {{having the}} power or {{function}} of selecting. Selective <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> means that its components are not comprehensive but selective. Among so many emergency issues, selective <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> tends {{to apply for}} the participation of selective stakeholders in the process of <b>emergency</b> <b>management,</b> unequal support for selective phases of <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> lifecycle, and inclusion of selective hazards and impacts into <b>emergency</b> <b>management.</b> In other words, selective <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> comes to happen for the goal of managing not all issues but some imminent issues in the field, because of bounded personnel, resources, and strategies. However, {{it is also true that}} the some cases of <b>emergency</b> <b>management</b> strategically rely on selective <b>emergency</b> <b>management,</b> though they have abundant personnel and resources.
