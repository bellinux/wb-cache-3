5|$|The Honduras Packet {{reached the}} Black River in November 1822. Bemused {{to find a}} country rather {{different}} from the Sketchs descriptions, and no sign of St Joseph, the emigrants set up camp on the shore, assuming that the Poyaisian authorities would soon contact them. They sent numerous search parties inland; one, guided by natives who recognised the name St Joseph, found some long-forgotten foundations and rubble. Hall quickly came to the private conclusion that MacGregor must have duped them, but reasoned that announcing such concerns prematurely would only demoralise the party and cause chaos. A few weeks after their arrival, {{the captain of the}} Honduras Packet abruptly and unilaterally sailed away amid a fierce storm; the emigrants found themselves alone apart from the natives and two American hermits. Comforting the settlers with vague assurances that the Poyaisian government would find them if they just stayed where they were, Hall set out for Cape Gracias a Dios, hoping to make contact with the Mosquito king or find another ship. Most of the emigrants found it impossible to believe that the Cazique had deliberately misled them, and posited that blame must lie elsewhere, or that there <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> terrible misunderstanding.|$|E

However, it seems there <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> lag in his transfer, as victory number ten is scored to his old {{squadron}} on 20 April. On 2 May, he scored his first victory flying a Fokker D.VII for his new squadron. With four wins in May, one in June, and six in August, his score had soon grown to 21.|$|E
25|$|From 1919-1922, Edge was a Joint Lord of the Treasury {{with his}} main role being {{to act as}} liaison between the Coalition {{government}} and the Labour Party. He was re-elected for Bolton in the 1922 general election standing as a National Liberal, that is as {{a supporter of the}} former coalition government and the Lloyd George faction in the Liberal Party, against Conservative, Labour and Asquithian Liberal opposition. Despite the decision of the Conservative Party at the Carlton Club meeting of 19 October 1922 to end the Coalition Government, there was clearly some goodwill remaining between the parties in Bolton as only one candidate from each stood in the election, and there <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> crossover of votes from the Conservatives to Edge. The Independent Liberal came bottom of the poll, behind the two Labour candidates. Edge was one of the National Liberal whips from 1922-23 but resigned in protest at the government's industrial policy of safeguarding (i.e. tariff protection), as it particularly affected the cotton industry through a proposed duty on fabric gloves – important in his Lancashire constituency. He was knighted in 1922.|$|E

500|$|Government {{ministers and}} {{the royal family}} found Wallis Simpson's {{background}} and behaviour unacceptable for a potential queen. Rumours and innuendo about her circulated in society. The King's mother, Queen Mary, was even told that Simpson might have held some sort of sexual control over Edward, as she had released him from an undefined sexual dysfunction through practices learnt in a Chinese brothel. This view was partially shared by Alan Don, Chaplain to the Archbishop of Canterbury, who wrote that he suspected the King [...] "is sexually abnormal which {{may account for the}} hold Mrs. S. has over him". Even Edward VIII's official biographer, Philip Ziegler, noted that: [...] "There <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> sort of sadomasochistic relationship... relished the contempt and bullying she bestowed on him." ...|$|E

Easter Island had long been deforested of trees that size: Roggeveen in 1722, [...] "described the island as destitute of large trees; González in 1770 wrote, Not a single tree is to be found capable of furnishing a plank so much as 15cm in width; Forster in 1774 reported that there was not a tree upon the island which exceeded the height of 10 feet (Flenley and Bahn 1992:172).|$|E
2500|$|Staff of the Department of Civil Aviation {{calculated}} {{the most likely}} position of the centre of gravity on the fatal flight and found it was about 3.3% of Mean Aerodynamic Chord behind the rear limit. [...] They carried out some flight tests in a DC-3 with its centre of gravity 4.7% of MAC behind the rear limit and found there was a loss of longitudinal static stability that {{made it difficult to}} trim the aircraft for a constant airspeed but the low-speed flight handling qualities had not deteriorated seriously. [...] They concluded that the incorrect position of the centre of gravity did not adequately explain the accident and there <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> other cause, possibly highly unusual. The investigation ended without determining the cause.|$|E
2500|$|There <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> disquiet in {{governmental}} {{circles as}} to whether the surrender of Vale Royal was in fact legitimate, so steps were taken to put the matter beyond doubt. A special court was held at the abbey on 31 March 1539, with Cromwell himself as judge. However, instead of investigating the circumstances of the surrender, the court charged the abbot with treason and the murder of a monk who had committed suicide in 1536, serious crimes that would have earned the death penalty. The abbot was found guilty and Vale Royal was declared forfeit to the crown because of his crimes. However, Abbot John was not executed, instead he was given the substantial pension of £60 per year and the abbey's plate, indicating that the trial was a method of putting pressure on him to acquiesce to the wishes of Cromwell and Holcroft regarding the fate of his monastery. The rest of the community were also pensioned off. Pension records indicate that Abbot John lived until at least 1546.|$|E

2500|$|In 1907, Captain Johnson {{was still}} in charge of Mount Royal. On the {{afternoon}} of July 6, [...] he was returning from Hazelton and was steaming through the Kitselas Canyon, when disaster struck. A strong wind pushed her into a large rock formation named Ringbolt Island, wedging her crosswise against the current. Luckily, she held while the passengers and crew scrambled to safety on the shore. Johnson assessed the situation and decided that Mount Royal could be saved and with ten crewmen, he returned aboard. He had decided {{that the best way}} to deal with this problem was to use the capstan to winch the sternwheeler back over Ringboat Island. This proved to be a disastrous decision. The king post broke and rammed through the bottom of Mount Royal and she buckled as the current washed over her, then she rolled upside down and broke into pieces. Although Johnson survived, six of the crewmen drowned, including the first officer. One of the four survivors was rescued by George Little, who would later become the founder of the town of Terrace. George and a companion spotted the wrecked hull as the wreckage floated past the community of Kitselas. Curious, they paddled out to it and saw a hand waving at them from a hole in hull. The survivor was Mount Royals chief engineer, Ben Maddigan, who was trapped in the bilge and filthy, but unhurt. After George Little chopped him out, Little commented that there <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> air down there. The exhausted engineer replied, [...] "I don’t know about air, but there was one hell of a lot of water!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Roman Lincoln {{had a very}} {{sophisticated}} water supply. It was fed by the ‘‘Roaring Meg’’ spring to the North East {{of the city and}} then ran parallel with the Nettleham Road towards the N.E corner of the Upper Colonia. The ceramic pipes were encased in concrete that provided a waterproof seal and allowed the water to pass through the pipes under pressure. The course of the aqueduct had been well known {{from the start of the}} 18th century. William Stukeley had shown the line of the aqueduct on his plan of Lincoln in 1722. The Lincoln antiquary Thomas Sympson had written in the mid 18th century [...] "There <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> contrivance for raising the water a good deal above its natural level before it would run to Lindum; the spring being evidently lower than the Town: and indeed there are some traces of a Tower, or some such building at the end of the Aquaeduct by the Spring, which one may suppose would have had a reservoir on its Top." [...] In 1782 the artist Samuel Hieronymus Grimm drew sections of the sheathed pipe and also where it emerged from the ground at the spring. Over the years further lengths of the aqueduct have been uncovered and the base for a watertank fed by the aqueduct discovered just inside the Roman Wall to the east of the Newport Arch. This is just to the north of Cottesford Place, where excavations in the 1960s revealed a probable Roma Bathhouse, which could have been supplied with water from this source. [...] Another pipeline, encased in concrete was found in 1857 by the Greestone Stairs, to the east of the wall, and this pipeline had presumably branched off from the aqueduct and supplied water to the Lower Colonia. Thompson calculated that it would be necessary to raise the water about 70 feet at the source at the ‘‘Roaring Meg’’ for there to be sufficient pressure for the water to reach the tank at the East Bight by the Newport Arch. This may imply that there was some form of water tower and the Romans may either have used some form of pump to raise the water, or a revolving bucket and chain system.|$|E
