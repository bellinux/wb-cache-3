25|$|A phonon is {{a quantum}} {{mechanical}} description of an elementary vibrational motion {{in which a}} lattice of atoms or molecules uniformly oscillates at a single frequency. In classical mechanics this designates a normal <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>vibration.</b> Normal modes are important because any arbitrary lattice vibration can {{be considered to be}} a superposition of these elementary vibration modes (cf. Fourier analysis). While normal modes are wave-like phenomena in classical mechanics, phonons have particle-like properties too, in a way related to the wave–particle duality of quantum mechanics.|$|E
25|$|Optical phonons have a non-zero {{frequency}} at the Brillouin {{zone center}} and show no dispersion near that long wavelength limit. This {{is because they}} correspond to a <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>vibration</b> where positive and negative ions at adjacent lattice sites swing against each other, creating a time-varying electrical dipole moment. Optical phonons that interact in this way with light are called infrared active. Optical phonons that are Raman active can also interact indirectly with light, through Raman scattering. Optical phonons are often abbreviated as LO and TO phonons, for the longitudinal and transverse modes respectively; the splitting between LO and TO frequencies is often described accurately by the Lyddane–Sachs–Teller relation.|$|E

50|$|In general, a {{molecule}} with N atoms has 3N - 6 normal {{modes of vibration}}, but a linear molecule has 3N - 5 such modes, because rotation about its molecular axis cannot be observed. A diatomic molecule has one normal <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>vibration.</b> The normal modes of vibration of polyatomic molecules are independent of each other but each normal mode will involve simultaneous vibrations of {{different parts of the}} molecule such as different chemical bonds.|$|E
50|$|A <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>vibration</b> is {{characterized}} by a modal frequency and a mode shape. It is numbered according to the number of half waves in the vibration. For example, if a vibrating beam with both ends pinned displayed a mode shape of half of a sine wave (one peak on the vibrating beam) it would be vibrating in mode 1. If it had a full sine wave (one peak and one trough) it would be vibrating in mode 2.|$|E

This sets up a positive feedback loop exciting the structure's free vibration. Flutter is self-starting and results in large amplitude vibration which often lead to rapid failure.|$|E

These partials are customarily given names such as hum, prime, minor third (or tierce), fifth (or quint), octave (or nominal), upper octave, etc. The strike note of the bell, which is determined by three partials (the octave, upper fifth, and the upper octave), is generally close to the pitch of the prime in a well-tuned bell."

50|$|Quartz has {{the further}} {{advantage}} that its elastic constants and its size change {{in such a}} way that the frequency dependence on temperature can be very low. The specific characteristics depend on the <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> <b>vibration</b> and the angle at which the quartz is cut (relative to its crystallographic axes). Therefore, the resonant frequency of the plate, which depends on its size, does not change much. This means that a quartz clock, filter or oscillator remains accurate. For critical applications the quartz oscillator is mounted in a temperature-controlled container, called a crystal oven, and can also be mounted on shock absorbers to prevent perturbation by external mechanical vibrations.|$|E

A wind chime will give the clearest and loudest tone when it is hung using one of these node points as the attachment point. These attachment points are also the same as used by other similar instrument such as the xylophone and glockenspiel.|$|E

40|$|The sound {{radiation}} of vibrating plates is often characterized by modal radiation efficiencies. In most cases {{it is assumed}} that the spatial distribution of damping is homogeneous and structural <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>vibration</b> are real valued. With the increasing use of high-performance, lightweight structures and rising acoustic requirements the demand of damping treatments is growing. For reasons of weight minimization, these treatments may be distributed locally at some critical locations of the structure, so that the assumption of homogeneity is violated. In this case the dynamics of the system within the resonances is no longer dominated by pure standing waves, but also by a superposition with travelling waves. These phenomena are generally known as complex <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>vibration.</b> This paper summarizes the results of a numerical study on {{sound radiation}} properties <b>of</b> complex <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>vibration.</b> ...|$|R
