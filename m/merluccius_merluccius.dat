40|$|Fish muscle {{proteins}} undergo complex physicochemical {{changes during}} frozen storage which {{result in the}} toughening of muscle and unpalatability. The aim of this thesis {{was to examine the}} aggregation of fish proteins as a result of frozen storage, in particular the effect of formaldehyde on proteins. Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and Namibian hake (<b>Merluccius</b> capensis and <b>Merluccius</b> paradoxus) muscle proteins were characterised and differentiated by electrophoretic and immunological approaches. The nature of the chemical bonds involved was elucidated by the use of reagents capable of breaking the non-covalent and covalent bonds. Conformational changes of the protein were investigated by both immunological and chemical techniques. Structural and textural changes on frozen storage in the presence of formaldehyde were examined by microscopic, deformation-compression analysis and dynamic mechanical testing. In addition, a lysosomal enzyme (Trimethylamine oxidase) which is responsible for the toughening of gadoid fish muscle during storage was characterised. Electrophoretic separation of the sarcoplasmic proteins from <b>Merluccius</b> capensis and <b>Merluccius</b> paradoxus confirmed the biological closeness of the two species. A 19 kD protein band from M. capensis, excised from the SDS gel, was used for the production of polyclonal antibodies as analysed by an Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Formaldehyde and frozen storage augmented the extent of protein insolubilisation. The results of this study showed conclusively that formaldehyde {{is only one of many}} factors involved in the denaturation of fish proteins during frozen storage. List of objectives of the project. The objectives were: to characterise the fish muscle proteins and differentiate between the Namibian hake species <b>Merluccius</b> capensis and <b>Merluccius</b> paradoxus; to elucidate the chemical aspects related to solubility and foaming of fish muscle proteins in the presence of formaldehyde; to assess structural and textural changes in frozen and formaldehyde treated fish proteins by microscopy and viscoelastic measurements; to examine the changes in sulphydryl, disulphide and hydrophobic groups during frozen storage; to examine the changes in sulphydryl, disulphide and hydrophobic groups in the presence of formaldehyde; to monitor the degradation of trimethylamine oxide, formaldehyde and trimethylamine during frozen, storage of fish; and to characterise the enzyme TMAOase and to assess the effect of inhibitors.

Historical fishery and biological data series available from IEO (1988 onwards) were used to describe and quantify patterns and spatio-temporal changes in catches and discards in the hake fishery. Data were collected by scientific observers on board Spanish fishing vessels operating in the study area. Data collected on fishing activity included effort, catches and discards of target and non-target species on a haul-by-haul basis. Biological information (size, sex, maturity, etc) on target species was recorded on a daily basis, while biological data on non-target species was recorded periodically. The “discards ratio” was calculated by each haul, defined as the total weight of fish discarded divided by the total catch weight. The most important by-catch species are hoki or whiptailed hake (Macruronus magellanicus), red cod (Salilota australis), southern blue whiting (Micromesistius australis), Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) and kingclip (Genypterus blacodes). Discards included both target and non-target species.

40|$|From 1992 to 2001, {{by-catch}} {{that was}} landed from the Spanish deepwater trawl fishery for black hake off Mauritania was closely monitored. This {{is a highly}} specialised fishery, with two species of black hake (<b>Merluccius</b> senegalensis and <b>Merluccius</b> polli) constituting between 77 – 99 % of total land-ings, which have annually averaged 9 300 tons {{over the past two}} decades. Landings of Sparidae were highest among by-catch species of commercial value, with the large-eye dentex, Dentex macrophthal-mus being the most important until 1996, after which the family Lophiidae and others predominated. Next were the Elasmobranchii, including large demersal squalids and several species of rays, although their annual landings fell from 182 tons in 1992 to only 4 tons in 1999, rising to 37 tons in 2001. The present paper analyses these changes using by-catches retained in the black hake fishery. We believe that the decline could be due to a set of different factors: a change in depths fished, economic reasons and probable over-exploitation of both targeted species and by-catch. Elasmobranchs constituted only 0. 1 % of total landings in 1999, compared to 1. 9 % in 1992, although their contribution to total com-mercial by-catch was constant. Seasonality was clearly evident, with an absolute and proportional rise in elasmobranch by-catch during warm periods, reaching 75 % of by-catch landings in some months, coinciding with a drop in total by-catch. These seasonal variations could be related to the migratory habits of the fishery's target species, black hake...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 1984. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The chief {{sector of}} the South African fishing industry, {{demersal}} trawling {{is in a state}} of uncertainty that brings its competitiveness and long term developnent into question. The Hake (<b>Merluccius</b> capensis and <b>Merluccius</b> paradoxus) resource, which accounts for 70 % of the landed catch, has finally started on the expected road to recovery and it is anticipated that this will proceed shortly for a nunber of years. During 1983 comfort was derived from the resulting rise in catch per unit effort rates and a significant improvement in the average size of fish landed. This, together with lower fuel prices and increased operating efficiences, enable the industry to operate at lower expenditure. Unfortunately, a second successive reflection of the T. A. C. (Total Allowable Catch) of 12 % in 1983 meant that gains in productivity were not fully reflected in reduced landed costs. This year (1984) the T. A. C. was increased by 4, 8 % which only marginally improves the already poor situation. More serious difficulties can be traced to adverse market developments. The price of fish has fallen in real terms (see Table 1. 1 below) over a number of years. However, in 1983, the industry experienced a startling fall in prices, the severity of which may be gauged from the fact that actual prices realised were roughly equal to those of 1981.

The great abundance of marine resources among parallels 35 º and 54 º South, is associated with the Subtropical Convergence formed by the Brazil and Falkland/Malvinas currents. The mixing of the flow of La Plata River and the western branch of the Falkland/Malvinas Current generates areas of high plankton production on the shelf. Hakes (<b>Merluccius</b> hubbsi and <b>Merluccius</b> australis) and cephalopods (Illex argentinus and Loligo gahi) have been found the main commercial species, with important amounts of accompanying species in the catches such as Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides), Kingclip (Genypterus blacodes), Hoki (Macruronus magellanicus), Red cod (Salilota australis), Southern blue whiting (Micromesistius australis), etc. These fisheries are currently among the most important to the Spanish bottom trawler freezing fleet that has around 40 vessels fishing in this area, besides another 20 that operate in joint ventures sailing Falkland flag.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} fisheries in the northern Benguela is the Namibian hake fishery, which targets both <b>Merluccius</b> capensis and <b>Merluccius</b> paradoxus. In spite of attempts to rebuild the hake stocks that were severely depleted by distant-water fleets before Namibia's independence in 1990, stocks have failed to recover. Because the ecological goal of stock rebuilding competes with social and economic objectives on the political stage, the ability to make accurate abundance estimates is important. However, the precision of abundance estimates is impeded by lack of understanding of hake behavior and of the effects of environmental factors. Furthermore, at present both species of hake are assessed and managed as one Namibian stock. We present qualitative information derived from interviews that we conducted with Namibian hake trawl and longline fishers during the 2009 and 2010 fishing seasons, and information gleaned from analyzing logbook data. We contextualize both types of data within the scientific literature on Namibian hakes and the Namibian hake fishery. Fishers monitor sea surface and bottom temperature, water quality, currents, and weather, and they have detailed knowledge about the behavior and habitat of hakes. Fishers differentiate between three different types of M. capensis, which they associate with different fishing areas. They also describe innovations that have taken place over the past 20 years, which are of relevance to the assessment of fishing efficiency and effort, but have not been taken into account in the stock assessments. Our analysis of logbook data supports the increase in efficiency. The results show that closer collaboration between scientists and fishers has the potential to improve the accuracy of survey estimates and stock assessments, and thus is important for rebuilding of hake stocks and the hake fishery...|$|R

Data on landings and effort by Spanish vessels from 1983 onwards were utilised to study trends and shifts within the fishery. These data were provided by Asociación Nacional de Armadores de Buques Congeladores de Pesca de Merluza (ANAMER), the most important Spanish ship-owners fishing association operating in distant fishing grounds. Catch and effort data collected by observer’s programmes carried out by Instituto Español de Oceanografía (IEO) and the Falkland Islands Government Fisheries Department (FIGFD), as well as by observers provided by the project were used to estimate CPUE by area and season. The data included landings in kgs by commercial size category of hake (both species together) and effort made by vessels appertaining to ANAMER in number of fishing days and number of vessels by vessel size category. Conversion factors obtained by scientific observers onboard of these vessels were used to obtain the whole catch from landings. Total effort of the Spanish fleet was estimated from ANAMER logbooks, assuming a similar pattern for the whole fleet and taking into account the different ratio of ANAMER fleet compared to the total Spanish fleet. An increase of the catches and effort was observed from 1983 to a maximum in 1990 coinciding with the closure of Namibian fisheries. After that, catches and effort decreased corresponding to the development of the Greenland halibut fishery in the NW Atlantic, until its stabilisation from 1993.

The advantages of SSCPs in comparison with current genetic methods of egg identification are based on their technical simplicity and low price. The application of the PCR-SSCP methodology is proposed for routine genetic analyses in plankton surveys...|$|E
40|$|The {{recruitment}} dynamics {{into the}} fishery of eight {{species in the}} northwestern Mediterranean Sea was studied {{on the basis of}} a monthly length sampling on commercial landings lasting one year (March 1999 -February 2000). The results show that three species or groups of species (Mullus barbatus and M. surmuletus, Eledone cirrhosa and Loligo vulgaris) recruited mostly during a well-defined and regular season, while recruitment of the rest of species (<b>Merluccius</b> <b>merluccius,</b> Micromesistius poutassou, Phycis blennoides, Sepia officinalis and Trisopterus minutus capelanus) took place all year round, though with seasonal peaks. Landings of small <b>Merluccius</b> <b>merluccius</b> showed a progressive declining trend from the early 1990 s, while the opposite was found for Mullus barbatus and M. surmuletu...|$|E

40|$|The enzyme CYP 1 A is an {{established}} biomarker of fish exposure to {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The metallothioneins (MT), a family of Cys-rich proteins, bind {{a wide range of}} metals and participate in their metabolism. The aim {{of the study was to}} examine the correlation between CYP 1 A and MT expression in commercially important fish species Mullus barbatus and <b>Merluccius</b> <b>merluccius</b> and contaminants (PAHs, PCBs, toxic metals) in seawater and sediment from three localities with different level of contamination in the Adriatic Sea in winter, i. e., Platamuni, Valdanos and the port of Bar. The relative concentration of CYP 1 A was the highest in both fish species from Bar. Increased concentrations of PCBs in the seawater were observed only in Bar. A species-specific higher increase in the protein concentration of CYP 1 A was observed in Mullus barbatus compared to <b>Merluccius</b> <b>merluccius.</b> The levels of MT were the highest in <b>Merluccius</b> <b>merluccius</b> from Bar and in Mullus barbatus from Valdanos. The induction of MT correlated with the elevated concentrations of Cu and Pb determined by chemical analysis of the seawater from Bar and Valdanos, respectively. According to the chemical analysis of the seawater and the biological response of the fish, the Platamuni locality exhibited the lowest level of contamination...|$|E
