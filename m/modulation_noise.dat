5000|$|Under Haddy's {{technical}} leadership, Decca was {{the first}} British company to issue long playing records (1950) {{and was in the}} vanguard of stereophony {{in the middle of the}} decade. He was also a pioneer of the video disc at the end of the 1960s, which did not succeed commercially, and of digital recording, which quickly became the industry standard. Of his work on the latter, Ivor Humphreys wrote in Gramophone: Haddy was a keen advocate of recording from the start, noting in particular the benefits of zero tape <b>modulation</b> <b>noise,</b> the enormous signal-to-noise ratio and the fact that a copy of a digital master really is a genuine cloneand not a marginally degraded copy. He was not uncritical, though, and was troubled especially by recordings in which the ambient noise of a venue is seemingly modified or all but eliminated, and he made various tests to try to quantify the effect. The accepted need now to preserve some degree of background ambient noise if a recording is to sound natural and lifelike is due in part to his concern.|$|E

40|$|Recordings of an {{acoustic}} signal on magnetic tape often show noise, {{which may be}} divided into two main classes: additive noise and multiplicative noise. A characteristic of the latter is that it is weak with weak signals and strong with strong signals. This <b>modulation</b> <b>noise</b> has been subjected to a number of technical studies (cf. Eldridge, 1964). According to its physical causes one may distinguish asperity noise, friction noise, and to some extent structure noise.

40|$|The {{properties}} of medium noise in magnetic recording are usually evaluated by using various different terms; namely, bulk erased noise, AC-biased noise, DC-magnetized noise and recorded signal noise. These evaluated medium noise, however, {{can be arranged}} by combining two elemental components. One is the random component which is originated from the rerecording phenomenon of bulk erased noise {{and the other is}} the modulated component resulted from bulky irregularities of the medium. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present several data about the later component, the <b>modulation</b> <b>noise,</b> and to investigate the origins of this noise component. <b>Modulation</b> <b>noise</b> is not included in bulk erased noise or AC-biased noise but is included in DC-magnetized noise and recorded signal noise. In DC-magnetized noise, the <b>modulation</b> <b>noise</b> component yields a peculiar transformation of its noise spectrum in the lower frequency region; on the other hand, it produces a side band spectrum skirt beside the signal in the recorded signal noise spectrum. The magnitude of <b>modulation</b> <b>noise</b> takes a maximam at the unsaturated region of a medium and then it gradually decreases with increasing magnetizing level. The roughness of the medium surface and the clustering of magnetic perticles in the coating layer are considered to be the origins of moduration noise; however, as for recent magnetic tapes, the later term seems to be the main origin of the <b>modulation</b> <b>noise...</b>|$|E

Magnetic media on polymeric substrates having acceptable magnetic properties {{were obtained by}} applying NiAl/CrMn underlayers prior to CoCrPt deposition with a nonmagnetic CoCrTa intermediate layer. Typical sputtered tape media deposited on traditional polymeric substrates at room temperature revealed sideband <b>modulation</b> <b>noise</b> and large intergranular exchange coupling. A substantial improvement in surface roughness by utilizing smooth polymeric substrates eliminated this <b>modulation</b> <b>noise</b> and accounted for the signal dependent broad-band noise power. This suggests that transition noise is a dominant component of medium noise in sputtered tape media. Additionally, substrate bias is shown {{to be effective in}} producing grain decoupling that is necessary for good signal-to-noise ratio.

50|$|Because dbx Type I and Type II are {{broadband}} (single-band) companders (unlike Dolby-A's four bands), {{they are}} susceptible to audible <b>noise</b> <b>modulation</b> and other artifacts. To deal with this, both Type I and II use very strong high-frequency pre-emphasis of the audio signal in both the recording path and the control signal path. This causes the compander to 'back off' the gain in certain circumstances and reduce the audibility of <b>noise</b> <b>modulation</b> - even with this pre-emphasis, <b>noise</b> <b>modulation</b> can become audible when using very noisy media to begin with, such as the Compact Cassette format. In the control signal path, the dbx Type II process rolls off {{the high and low}} frequency response to desensitize the system to frequency response errors - since the roll-off is only in the control path, it does not affect the audible sound.|$|R

Voice disorders are simulated by way of models of vocal frequency jitter and tremor, vocal amplitude shimmer and tremor, as well as pulsatile additive noise. Six experiments have been carried out to assess the synthesizer perceptually. Three experiments involve the perceptual categorization of male synthetic and human stimuli and one the auditory discrimination between synthetic and human tokens. A fifth experiment reports the auditory discrimination between synthetic tokens with different levels of additive and <b>modulation</b> <b>noise.</b> A sixth experiment reports the scoring by expert listeners of male synthetic stimuli on equal-appearing interval scales grade-roughness-breathiness (GRB).

40|$|In the {{previous}} paper, (Neelen, 1970), experiments were discussed on the audibility of amplitude modulation of narrow band signals and wide band signals, using a narrow noise band as modulating signal. For a narrow band carrier like a sinusoid {{it turned out}} that the frequency analysing faculty of the ear is important for modulation detection. It was possible to calculate the masking curve of the carrier from the measured modulation thresholds. For a wide band carrier like a periodic pulse the masking curves of the individual harmonics in the frequency spectrum overlap. Amplitude variations of the successive pulses smaller than about 1 dB (corresponding to 5 % modulation depth) were inaudible.

40|$|A {{procedure}} {{which may}} be used to analyze the noise characteristics of HBT oscillators is presented. A large signal model of a HBT is developed based largely on the Gummel-Poon transistor model. A new base-emitter diffusion capacitance model is also generated which shows improved accuracy over conventional bipolar transistor models in characterizing HBTs. The large signal characteristics of the oscillator are then established using a time domain simulator. Conversion matrix theory is applied to the large signal model to generate an equivalent linear oscillator model which accounts for all of the frequency conversion effects which occur due to circuit nonlinearities. A bias dependent noise model of the HBT is also developed. It is found that the dominant sources of noise within the device are due to thermal, shot, and flicker <b>noise.</b> The <b>modulation</b> of the shot and flicker noise sources are also analyzed. The amount of frequency conversion which occurs as a result from the <b>modulation</b> of these <b>noise</b> sources is established. The modulated noise sources within the HBT are then inserted into the linear oscillator model to establish the overall noise characteristics of the HBT oscillator. Experimental results are also presented which support the validity of the analysis procedure;It Is found that the effects which result from the modulation of shot and flicker noise sources within oscillators are very significant. The upconversion of noise due to the <b>modulation</b> of flicker <b>noise</b> sources is found to be as significant as the upconversion which results from circuit nonlinearities. Thus, the upconversion of flicker noise cannot be associated with any one nonlinear mechanism. Rather it is a result of a complex interaction between the circuit nonlinearities and <b>noise</b> <b>modulation</b> mechanisms;The <b>noise</b> within many other periodically driven nonlinear networks may also be characterized using the analysis procedure presented in this paper.

The synthesis method is derived from a new noise-shaping equation which interprets the modulator as a device performing frequency-weighted minimization of the modulation error. In the equation, a noise-shaping function which spectrally shapes the modulation error is chosen to be an elliptic filter. The resulting elliptic noise-shaping function, featuring a high attenuation of in-band noise, satisfies the modulator’s stability requirement. A four-bit 6 MHz wideband modulator and a single-bit 10. 7 MHz bandpass modulator are designed to demonstrate the superiority of this simple synthesis method.
