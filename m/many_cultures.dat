The loss of a dog can lead to strong emotional responses with demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.|$|E
5|$|Bat dung {{has been}} mined as guano from caves {{and used as}} fertilizer. Bats are natural {{reservoirs}} of many diseases including rabies; since they are highly mobile, social, and long-lived, they can readily spread diseases.

5|$|A mermaid is {{a legendary}} aquatic {{creature}} {{with the head}} and upper body of a female human and {{the tail of a}} fish. Mermaids appear in the folklore of <b>many</b> <b>cultures</b> worldwide, including the Near East, Europe, Africa and Asia. The first stories appeared in ancient Assyria, in which the goddess Atargatis transformed herself into a mermaid out of shame for accidentally killing her human lover. Mermaids are sometimes associated with perilous events such as floods, storms, shipwrecks and drownings. In other folk traditions (or sometimes within the same tradition), they can be benevolent or beneficent, bestowing boons or falling in love with humans.|$|E

5|$|According to a myth in <b>many</b> <b>cultures,</b> cats have {{multiple}} lives. In many countries, they {{are believed to}} have nine lives, but in Italy, Germany, Greece, Brazil and some Spanish-speaking regions, they are said to have seven lives, while in Turkish and Arabic traditions, the number of lives is six. The myth is attributed to the natural suppleness and swiftness cats exhibit to escape life-threatening situations. Also lending credence to this myth is the fact that falling cats often land on their feet, using an instinctive righting reflex to twist their bodies around. Nonetheless, cats can still be injured or killed by a high fall.|$|E
5|$|After 1492, {{a global}} {{exchange}} of previously local {{crops and livestock}} breeds occurred. Maize, potatoes, sweet potatoes and manioc were the key crops that spread from the New World to the Old, while varieties of wheat, barley, rice and turnips traveled from the Old World to the New. There had been few livestock species in the New World, with horses, cattle, sheep and goats being completely unknown before their arrival with Old World settlers. Crops moving in both directions across the Atlantic Ocean caused population growth {{around the world and}} a lasting effect on <b>many</b> <b>cultures.</b> Maize and cassava were introduced from Brazil into Africa by Portuguese traders in the 16th century, becoming staple foods, replacing native African crops.|$|E
5|$|Allegorical {{stories are}} central to the poetic diction of <b>many</b> <b>cultures,</b> and were {{prominent}} in the West during classical times, the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Aesop's Fables, repeatedly rendered in both verse and prose since first being recorded about 500 B.C., are perhaps the richest single source of allegorical poetry through the ages. Other notables examples include the Roman de la Rose, a 13th-century French poem, William Langland's Piers Ploughman in the 14th century, and Jean de la Fontaine's Fables (influenced by Aesop's) in the 17th century. Rather than being fully allegorical, however, a poem may contain symbols or allusions that deepen the meaning or effect of its words without constructing a full allegory.|$|E

5|$|Although {{homosexuality}} among females {{has taken}} place in <b>many</b> <b>cultures</b> in history, a recent phenomenon is the development of family among same-sex partners. Before the 1970s, the idea that same-sex adults formed long-term committed relationships was unknown to many people. The majority of lesbians (between 60% and 80%) report being in a long-term relationship. Sociologists credit the high number of paired women to gender role socialization: the inclination for women to commit to relationships doubles in a lesbian union. Unlike heterosexual relationships that tend to divide work based on sex roles, lesbian relationships divide chores evenly between both members. Studies have also reported that emotional bonds are closer in lesbian and gay relationships than heterosexual ones.|$|E
5|$|Dramatic {{poetry is}} drama written in verse to be spoken or sung, and appears in varying, {{sometimes}} related forms in <b>many</b> <b>cultures.</b> Greek tragedy in verse {{dates to the}} 6th century B.C., {{and may have been}} an influence on the development of Sanskrit drama, just as Indian drama in turn appears to have influenced the development of the bianwen verse dramas in China, forerunners of Chinese Opera. East Asian verse dramas also include Japanese Noh. Examples of dramatic poetry in Persian literature include Nizami's two famous dramatic works, Layla and Majnun and Khosrow and Shirin, Ferdowsi's tragedies such as Rostam and Sohrab, Rumi's Masnavi, Gorgani's tragedy of Vis and Ramin, and Vahshi's tragedy of Farhad.|$|E
5|$|Idiophones were {{extremely}} important in Chinese music, hence {{the majority of}} early instruments were idiophones. Poetry of the Shang dynasty mentions bells, chimes, drums, and globular flutes carved from bone, the latter {{of which has been}} excavated and preserved by archaeologists. The Zhou dynasty saw percussion instruments such as clappers, troughs, wooden fish, and yǔ (wooden tiger). Wind instruments such as flute, pan-pipes, pitch-pipes, and mouth organs also appeared in this time period.
