5|$|An air well or aerial well is a {{structure}} or device that collects water by promoting the condensation of moisture from air.

40|$|A numeral control micropositioning {{workpiece}} {{table is}} presented that is mainly {{made up of}} a <b>moving</b> <b>part,</b> a base, three piezoelectric translators, and three capacitive sensors. An elastic structure with three half-notch flexure hinges is used to generate preload for piezoelectric translators. With the aid of the FEM, the structural dimensions of the <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> and flexure hinges is designed with the consideration of stiffness match between the <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> and the piezoelectric translators. Meanwhile, the position of flexure hinges is also chosen to reduce bending deformation of the <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> and to enlarge external dimensions of the workpiece table. The theoretical algorithm of the <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> rotating about an arbitrary symmetric axis is developed. The experimental results illustrate that the workpiece table has a nature frequency of 584 Hz, an open loop control stiffness of 104 N/μm at the central point of the <b>moving</b> <b>part,</b> a closed loop control stiffness of 650 N/μm at work area of the table, a resolution of 6 nm and a positioning accuracy of 49 nm...|$|R
40|$|Frictional {{characteristics}} of a small aerostatic linear bearing are accurately evaluated {{by means of a}} method, in which the force acting on the <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> of the bearing is measured as the inertial force. An optical interferometer is newly developed to measure the Doppler shift frequency of the laser light reflected on the small <b>moving</b> <b>part.</b> From the measured time-varying Doppler shift frequency, the velocity, the position, the acceleration and the inertial force of the <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> are numerically calculated. It is confirmed that the dynamic frictional force acting inside the bearing is almost proportional to the velocity of the <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> and is similar to the theoretical value calculated under the assumption that the flow inside the bearing is the Couette flow...|$|R

5|$|The use of sleeve {{valves and}} oil baths to {{lubricate}} the <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> {{of the engine}} units was inspired by contemporary internal combustion engine practice. This included oscillating gear that gave a 25-degree axial movement to the sleeves, allowing even lubrication of the <b>moving</b> <b>parts.</b> However, this resulted in an over-complicated mechanism that was difficult to maintain, perpetuating the seizures {{it was meant to}} eradicate. This feature was removed from both bogies of the prototype as the trials progressed. Another innovative feature of the steam bogie assembly was the ability to interchange them when faults occurred, an easy operation for maintenance staff when compared to the complexities of overhauling a regular steam locomotive's motion.|$|E

5|$|Marine {{transport}} {{can also}} be impacted by volcanic ash. Ash fall will block air and oil filters and abrade any <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> if ingested into engines. Navigation will be impacted by a reduction in visibility during ash fall. Vesiculated ash (pumice and scoria) will float on the water surface in ‘pumice rafts’ which can clog water intakes quickly, leading to over heating of machinery.|$|E

5|$|Although {{bicycles}} and motorcycles can {{appear to be}} simple mechanisms with only four major <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> (frame, fork, and two wheels), these parts are arranged {{in a way that}} makes them complicated to analyze.

5|$|Ash may disrupt {{transportation}} systems over large areas for hours to days, including roads and vehicles, railways and ports and shipping. Falling ash {{will reduce the}} visibility which can make driving difficult and dangerous. In addition, fast travelling cars will stir up ash, creating billowing clouds which perpetuate ongoing visibility hazards. Ash accumulations will decrease traction, especially when wet, and cover road markings. Fine-grained ash can infiltrate openings in cars and abrade most surfaces, especially between <b>moving</b> <b>parts.</b> Air and oil filters will become blocked requiring frequent replacement. Rail transport is less vulnerable, with disruptions mainly caused by reduction in visibility.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{mechanical}} experience {{gained from the}} Merchant Navy locomotives, Bulleid incorporated his chain-driven valve gear into what became the new design. This now-infamous component was unique in British locomotive design. It gained notoriety because {{it was difficult to}} access when things went wrong and, in tandem with the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser, could cause irregular valve movements. The entire system was in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, that provided constant lubrication to the <b>moving</b> <b>parts.</b>|$|E
40|$|Observed {{peaks in}} a {{levitation}} mass method (LMM), {{which are usually}} addressed to signal noise, are discussed in this work.

50|$|In this {{interruption}} principle arc {{energy is}} used, {{on the one}} hand to generate the blast by thermal expansion and, on the other hand, to accelerate the <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> of the circuit breaker when interrupting high currents. The overpressure produced by the arc energy downstream of the interruption zone is applied on an auxiliary piston linked with the <b>moving</b> <b>part.</b> The resulting force accelerates the <b>moving</b> <b>part,</b> thus increasing the energy available for tripping. With this interrupting principle it is possible, during high-current interruptions, to increase by about 30% the tripping energy delivered by the operating mechanism and to maintain the opening speed independently of the current. It is obviously better suited to circuit breakers with high breaking currents, such as generator circuit breakers.|$|R

5|$|For many years, the Moon {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an excellent site for telescopes. It is relatively nearby; astronomical seeing is not a concern; certain craters near the poles are permanently dark and cold, and thus especially useful for infrared telescopes; and radio telescopes {{on the far side}} would be shielded from the radio chatter of Earth. The lunar soil, although it poses a problem for any <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> of telescopes, can be mixed with carbon nanotubes and epoxies and employed in the construction of mirrors up to 50 meters in diameter.

5|$|It was {{originally}} intended to use a gear-driven valve gear, but space restrictions within the frames and wartime material shortages led Bulleid to design his novel chain-driven valve gear. This component was unique amongst British locomotive design practices. It later gained a bad reputation, because it could cause highly irregular valve events, a problem compounded by the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser. The entire system was located in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, providing constant lubrication to the <b>moving</b> <b>parts.</b>|$|E
5|$|The P90 {{requires}} minimal maintenance, {{and it can}} be disassembled {{quickly and}} easily. It is a modular firearm, consisting of four main component groups: the barrel and optical sight group, the <b>moving</b> <b>parts</b> group, the frame and trigger group, and the hammer group. The P90's barrel is cold hammer-forged and chrome-lined, with an overall length of 263mm (10.4in). The barrel has eight rifling grooves with a right-hand twist rate of 1:231mm (1:9.1in), and it is equipped with a diagonally cut flash suppressor that also acts as a recoil compensator. The stated service life of the barrel is 20,000 rounds.|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} {{evaluating}} {{the components of the}} force acting on a <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> of a pneumatic linear bearing is proposed. The total force acting on the <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> is accurately measured as the inertial force using an optical interferometer. Then, the components of the force, such as the force component depending on position, the force component depending on velocity, and the force component depending on tilt angle, are evaluated using the least-squares method. In the experiment, the total force acting on the <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> is measured with the standard uncertainty of approximately 0. 001 N, which corresponds to approximately 0. 003 % (30 ppm) of the gravitational force acting on it (M = 4. 119 kg) of approximately 40 N (40 N). The experimentally evaluated values of these force components well coincide with the theoretically expected values...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} realize active {{grinding}} control, a nanometer micropositioning table is designed. The table has a circular working area with diameter of 150 mm. Three piezoelectric actuators are utilized in parallel {{to drive the}} <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> with flexure guide mechanism. Through cooperation of the three piezoelectric actuators, the <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> can implement 3 -DOF nanometer positioning. The flexure hinge mechanism can also provide preload for the actuators. The preload can keep the <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> from separation with the piezoelectric actuators during moving process. The dynamic model of the micropositioning table is developed with consideration of the driving circuit. To improve the dynamic performance of the micropositioning table, a decoupling PID controller is designed by use of frequency domain approach. The experimental tests {{have been carried out}} to verify the performance of the micropositioning table and the established decoupling controller...|$|R

To achieve prescribed speed response derived control law requires estimation of an external force, which is ob-tained from the set of observers. The first observer works in pseudo-sliding mode and observes speed of <b>moving</b> <b>part</b> while the second one has filtering effect for elimination of the previous one chattering.
