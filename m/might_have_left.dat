5|$|An 18th-century account {{suggests}} that females <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> their newborn calves in isolation and returned regularly to suckle {{them until the}} calves {{were old enough to}} join herds, which is similar to the behaviour of roan and sable antelopes. Akin to other grazing antelopes, the bluebuck probably calved mainly where rainfall, and thus the availability of grasses, peaked. Such locations could be the western margin of the CFR during winter and the eastern margin of the CFR during summer. Faith et al. 2013 found that the occurrence of juveniles in bluebuck fossils decreases linearly from the west to the east, indicating that most births took place in the western CFR; due to the preference for rainfall, it may be further assumed that most births occurred during winter, when the western CFR receives most of its rainfall. The annual west-to-east migration would have followed in summer, consistent with the greater number of adult juveniles in the east that would have joined herds. Juvenile fossils also occur in other places across the range, but appear to be concentrated in the western CFR.|$|E

In a place where there is no suspicion of snakes, this prohibition does not apply (tosafos, beitzah 6a).|$|E

25|$|One thing more: at {{the close}} of the Civil War, when the problem of the emancipated slaves was before the nation, it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> them in a {{condition}} of alienage, or established them as wards of the government, like the Indian tribes, and thus retained for the nation jurisdiction over them, or it might, as it did, give them citizenship. It chose the latter. By the Fourteenth Amendment, it made citizens of all born within the limits of the United States and subject to its jurisdiction. By the Fifteenth, it prohibited any state from denying the right of suffrage on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude, and by the Thirteenth, it forbade slavery or involuntary servitude anywhere within the limits of the land. Whether this was or was not the wiser way to deal with the great problem is not a matter for the courts to consider. It is for us to accept the decision, which declined to constitute them wards of the nation or leave them in a condition of alienage where they would be subject to the jurisdiction of Congress, but gave them citizenship, doubtless believing that thereby, in the long run, their best interests would be subserved, they taking their chances with other citizens in the states where they should make their homes.|$|E
25|$|The film {{begins in}} a Los Angeles diner where a {{waitress}} named Slim (Jennifer Lopez) works with her best friend, Ginny (Juliette Lewis). She receives unwelcome romantic advances from Robbie, a customer who teases {{her about her}} name. Another man in the diner, Mitch Hiller (Billy Campbell), reveals that the customer had made a bet {{that he would be}} able to convince Slim to sleep with him. Soon after, Slim falls in love with and marries Mitch, and they have a child named Gracie (Tessa Allen). Years later, Slim finds out Mitch has been cheating on her with a French woman named Darcelle. She confronts him and he admits it, but also insisting Darcelle means nothing to him. Slim becomes angry and threatens to leave, which enrages Mitch, who becomes violent, slapping and punching her in the face. He gives her a warning, saying that he makes the money and gets to do whatever he likes, implying he wants an open marriage. Mitch refuses to stop his affair unless she wants to fight him. The next day, Slim confides in Mitch's mother (Janet Carroll); she asks Slim what she did to make Mitch angry, implying he has a history of physical abuse. Ginny advises Slim to leave and imprison Mitch, but Slim does not want to hurt Gracie. She then goes to pick up Gracie from school, only to discover Mitch had already picked her up. Panicked that Mitch <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> town with her, she calls Mitch, who tells her that he took Gracie to the zoo.|$|E

As the crack begins to absorb Rory's body, the Doctor realises that Rory will be written out of history and forces Amy to board the TARDIS before the drill explodes. He tries to help her concentrate on remembering Rory, but a jolt from the TARDIS causes her to lose concentration and her memories of Rory are lost. The Doctor finds Amy's engagement ring, which Rory had stowed before the events, on the floor of the TARDIS.|$|E

Telling his friends {{he was thinking about}} taking a trip to Poland or Israel, Koval secured a passport for six months' travel to Europe. According to the Russian publication Rossiyskaya Gazeta, he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> because American counter-intelligence agents had discovered Soviet literature about his parents after being tipped off about the leak by a Soviet defector. He left by sea in October 1948 and never returned to his birth country. In Russia, he left the Soviet military with discharge papers as an untrained rifleman and the rank of private. His foreign background and service record made him [...] "a very suspicious character", he wrote to Kramish. Turned down for education and research positions, Koval turned to his old GRU contact, who secured him a job as a laboratory assistant at the Mendeleev Institute. Eventually, Koval managed to obtain a teaching job there; his students often laughed at his foreign pronunciations for technical terms.|$|E

2500|$|Historically, many IPOs {{have been}} underpriced. The effect of underpricing an IPO is to {{generate}} additional {{interest in the}} stock when it first becomes publicly traded. Flipping, or quickly selling shares for a profit, can lead to significant gains for investors who were allocated shares of the IPO at the offering price. However, underpricing an IPO results in lost potential capital for the issuer. One extreme example is theglobe.com IPO which helped fuel the IPO [...] "mania" [...] of the late 1990s internet era. Underwritten by Bear Stearns on 13 November 1998, the IPO was priced at $9 per share. The share price quickly increased 1000% on {{the opening day of}} trading, to a high of $97. Selling pressure from institutional flipping eventually drove the stock back down, and it closed the day at $63. Although the company did raise about $30 million from the offering, it is estimated that with the level of demand for the offering and the volume of trading that took place they <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> upwards of $200 million on the table.|$|E
2500|$|The 23,746 {{casualties}} at Shiloh shocked {{both the}} Union and Confederacy, whose combined totals exceeded casualties {{from all of}} the United States' previous wars. [...] The Battle of Shiloh led to much criticism of Grant for leaving his army unprepared defensively; he was also falsely accused of being drunk. [...] According to one account, President Lincoln rejected suggestions to dismiss Grant, saying, [...] "I can't spare this man; he fights." [...] After Shiloh, General Halleck took the field personally and gathered a 120,000-man army at Pittsburg Landing, including Grant's Army of the Tennessee, Buell's Army of the Ohio, and John Pope's Army of the Mississippi. [...] Halleck assigned Grant the role of second-in-command, with others in direct command of his divisions. Grant was upset over the situation and <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> his command, [...] but his friend and fellow officer, William T. Sherman, persuaded him to stay in Halleck's Army. [...] After capturing Corinth, Mississippi, the 120,000-man army was disbanded; Halleck was promoted to General in Chief of the Union Army and transferred east to Washington, D.C. [...] Grant resumed immediate command of the Army of the Tennessee and, a year later, captured the Confederate stronghold of Vicksburg.|$|E

Wilbur Chamberlin, a reporter for the New York Sun, sent to China, reported in a letter dated 9 February 1901 to his wife:My missionary friend, the Rev. A., is out of limbo....Quite a long time ago he had a scheme for collecting damages for all his native Christians and his church from the Chinese themselves. He went around to some forty villages and collected 80,000 taels. A few days ago he went back there and was promptly arrested at the instigation of some Roman Catholics. It appears they had the same sort of scheme, but A. got there first, and when they went around to these same villages to make their collections, they found out that he had all the money there was. Naturally, they were enraged, so they made complaint against A., and declared that he had been blackmailing the villages....I really think, myself, that A. <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> a little for the Catholics. I don't like to see a man take it all, even if he is a missionary." [...] Chamberlin indicated that the French and Germans, under pressure from the Americans, released him, insisting that he was never under arrest.|$|E

2500|$|Recording for the band's third studio album started {{relatively}} early, in February and March 2013, {{when the}} band spent a week-and-a-half with producer Malay. Lead vocalist Dougy Mandagi had met Malay during his stay in Los Angeles, {{and the two}} had a mutual admiration and respect for each other's work. Mandagi had been writing new ideas for songs during his stay in Los Angeles, {{while the rest of}} the band were at home in London, doing the same. While previously, the band made use of jam sessions to create new songs, the band opted instead to take different approaches to writing songs, such as combining various ideas, conceived by different members of the band, into single tracks. The band met up and held their first sessions at the La Casa Artist Residency, a recording studio situated in Byron Bay, New South Wales, and owned by American filmmaker Taylor Steele. Contrasting from a traditional recording studio, the residency was originally set up by Steele as a retreat for artists to spend time, between a few days to a few weeks, to [...] "find inspiration and make art, with Byron Bay as their muse." [...] The band spent a few weeks, over the course of two visits, at La Casa with Malay. The band amassed over thirty ideas for songs during the sessions, with [...] "Lost" [...] and [...] "Summer's Almost Gone" [...] being two of the earliest written and recorded tracks to eventually appear on the final album. According to drummer Toby Dundas, the band's experience with Malay opened them up to the idea of collaborating with other songwriters; an idea the band had previously rejected. Dunas explained, [...] "if it had gone badly it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> a bad taste in our mouths. But he bought something interesting to the table. We thought 'Look what happens when we work with people who bring their flavour to what we're doing' so we kept exploring that." ...|$|E

5000|$|MSS - Multi Stereo Surround - This {{approach}} {{treats the}} speakers in a surround sound {{system as a}} multitude of stereo pairs. For example, a stereo recording of a piano, created using two microphones in an ORTF configuration, <b>might</b> <b>have</b> its <b>left</b> channel sent to the left rear speaker and its right channel sent to the center speaker. The piano might also be sent to a reverb <b>having</b> its <b>left</b> and right outputs sent to the left front speaker and right rear speaker, respectively. Additional elements of the song, such as an acoustic guitar recorded in stereo, <b>might</b> <b>have</b> its <b>left</b> and right channels sent to a different stereo pair such as the left front speaker and the right rear speaker with its reverb returning to yet another stereo pair, the left rear speaker and the center speaker. Thus, multiple clean stereo recordings surround the listener without the smearing comb-filtering effects that often occur when the same or similar sources are sent to multiple speakers.|$|R
