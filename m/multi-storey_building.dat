5|$|The {{land was}} officially renamed Melville Island in late 1804 or early 1805 {{in honour of}} Henry Dundas, Viscount Melville (who at the time had just been {{appointed}} First Lord of the Admiralty). A wooden barracks-style military prison was constructed to house common prisoners, the cornerstone of which was laid in 1808 and is today preserved as a monument, while a <b>multi-storey</b> <b>building</b> was designed to hold officers. As no exchange system was established with the French, the prison quickly became overcrowded. Some Spanish prisoners were also housed in the prison at this time.|$|E
5|$|All these {{increasingly}} {{long distances}} {{came at a}} price, as illustrated by filmmaker Werner Herzog in his 1974 documentary The Great Ecstasy of Woodcarver Steiner. During both the aforementioned events in Oberstdorf and Planica, several athletes including Steiner had far exceeded {{the limits of the}} hill by 'out-jumping' it or simply 'running out of slope'. Jumps were much further than in the 1950s, during which the old Kongsberger technique was still in use. The results were now potentially fatal each time: athletes were coming only metres away from landing on completely flat ground, or the equivalent of falling from a <b>multi-storey</b> <b>building.</b> Furthermore, only a wool cap and goggles – or no headgear at all – were worn; an antiquated feature left unchanged from the very earliest days of ski jumping more than 150 years prior. In 1979, at their 32nd International Ski Congress in Nice, France, the FIS mandated helmets to be worn by athletes at all ski jumping and flying events.|$|E
25|$|Gobarau {{is said to}} be {{the first}} <b>multi-storey</b> <b>building</b> in West Africa, with its {{construction}} believed to have been completed during the reign of Sarkin Katsina (King) Muhammadu Korau (1398-1408 AD) -- the first Muslim King of Katsina. Originally built as the central Mosque of Katsina town, it was later used also as a school. By the beginning of the 16th century, Katsina had become a very important commercial and academic center in Hausaland, and Gobarau mosque had grown into a famed institution of higher Islamic education. Gobarau continued to be Katsina's Central mosque until the beginning of the 19th century AD.|$|E

500|$|Over time, {{the number}} of {{buildings}} within the site varied. Andrianjaka founded the Rova with three buildings and a dedicated tomb site in the early 17th century. The number of structures rose to approximately twenty during the late 18th-century reign of King Andrianampoinimerina. By the late 20th century, the Rova's structures {{had been reduced to}} eleven, representing various architectural styles and historical periods. The largest and most prominent of these was Manjakamiadana, also known as the [...] "Queen's Palace" [...] after Queen Ranavalona I, for whom the original wooden palace was built between 1839–1841 by Frenchman Jean Laborde. In 1867 the palace was encased in stone for Queen Ranavalona II by Scotsman James Cameron, an artisan missionary of the London Missionary Society. The neighbouring Tranovola, a smaller wooden palace constructed in 1819 by Creole trader Louis Gros for King Radama I, was the first <b>multi-storey</b> <b>building</b> with verandas in the Rova. The model offered by Tranovola transformed architecture throughout the highlands {{over the course of the}} 19th century, inspiring a widespread shift toward two-storey houses with verandas. The Rova grounds also contained a cross-shaped wooden house (Manampisoa) built as the private residence of Queen Rasoherina, a stone Protestant chapel (Fiangonana), nine royal tombs, and a number of named wooden houses built in the traditional style reserved for the andriana (nobles) in Imerina. Among the most significant of these were Besakana, erected in the early 17th century by Andrianjaka and considered the throne of the kingdom, and Mahitsielafanjaka, a later building which came to represent the seat of ancestral spiritual authority at the Rova.|$|E

It was there that the famous opera directors Leonid Baratov and Lev Mikhailov created their productions, the great Vladimir Bourmeister and his gifted follower Alexey Chichinadze staged their ballets, the wonderful stage [...] designers such as Boris Volkov and Alexander Lushin devised their unforgettable sets and the outstanding conductors Samuel Samosud, Dmitry Kitaenko and Vladimir Kozhukhar lead the orchestra. More than one generation of remarkable singers and dancers has starred there. After Dmitry Bryantsev took the lead of the Ballet Company in 1985 and Alexander Titel became the Artistic Director of the Opera Company in 1991, the theatre stepped into a new era, staying true to the great traditions of the founding fathers. It was necessary to adjust the theatre space and equipment to the contemporary artistic ideas and concepts and the need for a new reconstruction was recognized.|$|E

40|$|The conference paper can {{be viewed}} at: [URL] design and {{construction}} of <b>multi-storey</b> <b>buildings</b> faces a multitude of demands such as aesthetics, cost, energy efficiency, and occupier comfort; with façades on both new and re-used buildings playing {{a key role in}} helping to meet these demands. The process of façade selection is aided by a plethora of decision-making tools, yet façade decisions are often largely guided by cost and aesthetics. Poorly specified façades can potentially expose developers, owners and occupiers of <b>multi-storey</b> <b>buildings</b> to risks such as poor thermal comfort, glare, and increased operational costs. The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore the current state of façade decision-making, with the objectives of discovering who is making the decisions and when, and what problems are perceived and what potential solutions might exist. Literature pertaining to façades, <b>multi-storey</b> <b>buildings</b> and façade decision-making is reviewed. Experience of façade decision-making in today’s construction industry in the UK is collected via semi-structured interviews with construction professionals. The findings show architects as leading the initial façade decisions, with clients and planners making the final decisions. Very few decision-making tools were revealed as being used: namely whole life cost analysis, life cycle cost analysis and simulation. Further research is proposed to define the roles participating in façade decision-making for <b>multi-storey</b> <b>buildings...</b>|$|R
