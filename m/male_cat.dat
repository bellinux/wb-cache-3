5|$|A {{group of}} cats is {{referred}} to as a clowder or a glaring, a <b>male</b> <b>cat</b> is called a tom or tomcat (or a gib, if neutered), an unaltered female is called a queen, and a juvenile cat {{is referred to}} as a kitten. The male progenitor of a cat, especially a pedigreed cat, is its sire, and its female progenitor is its dam. In Early Modern English, the word kitten was interchangeable with the now obsolete word catling.|$|E
25|$|In January 1966, {{the body}} of an Iriomote cat that had been caught in a wild boar trap in the mid-basin of the Nakama River was sent to Koura at the University of the Ryukyus, {{but there was no}} more {{information}} regarding captures for some time after this. In December 1966, , a hunter at the Nakama River's mid-basin, caught a live <b>male</b> <b>cat,</b> but it escaped immediately. He then caught another <b>male</b> <b>cat</b> soon after.|$|E
25|$|Sexually dimorphic {{behaviors}} such as mounting, urine spraying and some forms of male aggression are reduced due to the decrease in hormone levels brought about by neutering. This is especially significant in male cats due to the extreme undesirability of these <b>male</b> <b>cat</b> sexual behaviors for many pet owners.|$|E
50|$|Analogous XXY syndromes {{are known}} to occur in cats—specifically, the {{presence}} of calico or tortoiseshell markings in <b>male</b> <b>cats</b> is {{an indicator of the}} relevant abnormal karyotype. As such, <b>male</b> <b>cats</b> with calico or tortoiseshell markings are a model organism for Klinefelter syndrome, because a color gene involved in cat tabby coloration is on the X chromosome.|$|R
50|$|Cats have anal sacs or scent glands. Scent is {{deposited}} on the feces {{as it is}} eliminated. Unlike intact <b>male</b> <b>cats,</b> female and neutered <b>male</b> <b>cats</b> usually do not spray urine. Spraying is accomplished by backing up against a vertical surface and spraying a jet of urine on that surface. Unlike a dog's penis, a cat's penis points backward. Males neutered in adulthood may still spray after neutering. Urinating on horizontal surfaces in the home, outside the litter box may indicate dissatisfaction with the box, due {{to a variety of}} factors such as substrate texture, cleanliness and privacy. It can also be a sign of urinary tract problems. <b>Male</b> <b>cats</b> on poor diets are susceptible to crystal formation in the urine which can block the urethra and create a medical emergency.|$|R
50|$|In {{the middle}} of the night two cats are singing to each other. Then another cat wants to sing with the female cat. She lets him. Then a fight starts between the two rival <b>males,</b> and the <b>cats</b> go on a {{telephone}} line. A person throws a rolling pin at them. Then they start rolling on the wires. They run into an old dog house and the dog scares them. The <b>male</b> <b>cats</b> eventually realize that the female cat has had babies, and one of them blows a raspberry at them. The two <b>male</b> <b>cats</b> shake hands and the film ends.|$|R
25|$|A {{few days}} later, Dirk Münch, Münch's son, {{publicly}} expressed {{his lack of}} comprehension of this interview. He explained {{that his father had}} been suffering from poor concentration for two years. He criticised the fact that Schindler's List had been watched directly before the interview, saying that this would have been very exhausting due to the film's three-hour length and his father's advanced age. Dirk Münch stated that, after the film, his father had even confused the female house cat Minka with the <b>male</b> <b>cat</b> Peter. A German filmmaker who made a documentary about Münch also stated that he was non compos mentis. He was later diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.|$|E

500|$|The {{hotel has}} a {{tradition}} of keeping a cat that has the run of the hotel. The practice dates to the 1930s, when Frank Case took in a stray <b>male</b> <b>cat</b> that was initially named [...] "Rusty." [...] Hotel lore says actor John Barrymore suggested the cat needed a more [...] "dignified" [...] name, so the cat was renamed [...] "Hamlet." [...] Nowadays, whenever the hotel has a <b>male</b> <b>cat,</b> he's named Hamlet; but if the hotel has a female cat, she's named [...] "Matilda." [...] The current Algonquin cat, a Matilda, is a Ragdoll that was named 2006 cat of the year at the Westchester (New York) Cat Show. [...] Visitors can spot Matilda on her personal chaise longue in the lobby; she can also be found in her favorite places: behind the computer on the front desk, or lounging on a baggage cart. The doormen feed her and the general manager's executive assistant answers Matilda's e-mail. During 2011, Matilda was temporarily confined to an upper floor or to the limits of a leash tethered to the check-in desk, due to a directive from the city Department of Health. As of late 2011, Matilda has been confined to the non-food areas of the lobby by an electronic pet fence.|$|E

2500|$|In 1925, {{animation}} pioneer Bill Nolan {{decided to}} bring Krazy to the screen again. [...] Nolan intended to produce the series under Associated Animators, but when it dissolved, he sought distribution from Margaret J. Winkler. Unlike earlier adaptations, Nolan did not base his shorts on the characters and setting of the Herriman comic strip. Instead, the feline in Nolan's cartoons was a <b>male</b> <b>cat</b> whose design and personality both reflected Felix the Cat. [...] This is {{probably due to the}} fact that Nolan himself was a former employee of the Pat Sullivan studio. Other Herriman characters appeared in the Nolan cartoons at first, though similarly altered: Kwakk Wakk was at times Krazy's paramour, with Ignatz often the bully trying to break up the romance. Over time, Nolan's influence waned and new directors, Ben Harrison and Manny Gould, took over the series. By late 1927, they were solely in charge.|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes {{this formula}} is varied. In his initial cartoon, Odor-able Kitty, Pepé (going {{by the name}} Henry in this short) unwittingly pursues a <b>male</b> <b>cat</b> who has {{deliberately}} disguised himself as a skunk (complete {{with the scent of}} Limburger cheese) in order to scare off a bunch of characters who have mistreated him. Scent-imental Over You has Pepé pursuing a female dog who has donned a skunk pelt (mistaking it for a fur coat). In the end, she removes her pelt, revealing that she's a dog. Pepé then [...] "reveals" [...] himself as another dog and the two embrace. However, he then reveals to the audience that he's still a skunk. In Wild Over You, Pepé attempts to seduce a wild cat that has escaped a zoo (during what is called [...] "Le grande tour du Zoo" [...] at a 1900 exhibition), and painted herself to look like a skunk to escape her keepers. This cartoon is notable for not only diverging from the Pepé/female-black-cat dynamic, but also rather cheekily showing that Pepé likes to be beaten up, considering the wild cat thrashes him numerous times. Really Scent is also a subversion with Penelope (here called [...] "Fabrette") attracted to him from the beginning, removing the need for Pepé to chase her as she goes to him. But Pepé's scent still causes a problem for her as they try to build a relationship.|$|E

40|$|High plasma IGF-I {{concentration}} {{has been}} found in large breed young dogs, but not in young cats. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the relation between the concentration of IGF-I and body weight in both <b>male</b> and female <b>cats</b> at young age. In this study, the plasma IGF-I concentrations and body weight in 4 female and 4 <b>male</b> <b>cats</b> at 5, 11, 17 and 21 months old were examined. No significant difference in the body weight between the female and male kittens (3. 1 +/- 0. 2 kg and 3. 2 +/- 0. 3 kg) at 5 months old was found, but at 11, 17 and 21 months old (5. 3 +/- 0. 2 kg, 5. 3 +/- 0. 4 kg, 5. 4 +/- 0. 2 kg) the <b>male</b> <b>cats</b> had significantly higher body weight (p< 0. 01) than the female cats (3. 1 +/- 0. 3 kg, 3. 3 +/- 0. 2 kg, 3. 4 +/- 0. 3 kg). The IGF- 1 concentration in the <b>male</b> <b>cats</b> (945 +/- 41 ng/ml) was significantly higher (p< 0. 05) than that in the female cats (520 +/- 39 ng/ml) at the age of 5 months.

5000|$|While {{external}} sexual {{organs of}} the animals who were sterilized {{at a younger age}} did not mature fully or to the same extent of those sterilized later, there was no significant negative impact on urinary tract health for most animals.

40|$|The initial {{cause of}} post-neutering weight gain in <b>male</b> <b>cats</b> {{is not entirely}} known. There is {{evidence}} that energy intake (EI) increases rapidly post-neutering, {{but it is not}} clear if neutering also decreases energy expenditure (EE) prior to weight gain. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine if a decrease in EE contributes to the initial shift toward positive energy balance in neutered <b>male</b> <b>cats.</b> To determine the influence of neutering on EE independent of changes in EI and body weight (BW), <b>male</b> <b>cats</b> were fed at their pre-neutering maintenance EI and EE was measured at 4 days pre-neutering, 3 – 4 days post-neutering, and 9 days post- neutering. Ad libitum food access was then provided for 6 months. Body composition was measured and blood samples collected for serum chemistry at pre-neutering and 7 days, 13 days and 6 months post-neutering. Total energy expenditure (TEE) adjusted for lean body mass (LBM) did not change in cats from pre-neutering to 9 days post-neutering. However, TEE adjusted for BW and resting energy expenditure adjusted for either LBM or BW showed a small, but significant (P, 0. 05) increase from pre-neutering to 9 days post-neutering. When allowed free choice food access, cats showed significant increases of food intake (FI) and BW. Circulating concentrations of ghrelin increased, while adiponectin levels decreased following neutering. The results of this study indicate that initial post-neutering weight gain in <b>male</b> <b>cats</b> results from increased FI and not decreased EE.

40|$|A {{clinical}} {{description of}} lower urinary tract disease (LUTD) in cats in 1925 [1] accurately described the clinical signs and the disease, and reported {{it to be}} commonplace. The terms feline urologic syndrome (FUS) and feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD) have since been {{used to describe the}} constellation of clinical signs related to irritative voiding but do not identify the underlying etiology. Most cats with LUTD have feline idiopathic or interstitial cystitis (FIC), but urolithiasis, bacterial urinary tract infection (UTI), anatomic malformations, neoplasia, behavioral disorders, and neurologic problems (eg, reflex dysnergia) may also occur, although more uncommonly than FIC. Regardless of the underlying etiology, the resultant clinical signs are similar and include dysuria, stranguria, hematuria (macroscopic and microscopic), pollakiuria, and periuria (a word used to refer to urination in inappropriate places). Obstructive and nonobstructive uropathy are broader concepts that may also be used to classify LUTD by {{the presence or absence of}} urethral obstruction, respectively.
