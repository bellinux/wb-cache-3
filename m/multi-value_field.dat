40|$|For {{more than}} 30 years, {{the author has}} studied the model-theoretic aspects {{of the theory of}} valued <b>fields</b> and <b>multi-valued</b> <b>fields.</b> Many of the key results {{included}} in this book were obtained by the author whilst preparing the manuscript. Thus the unique overview of the theory, as developed in the book, has been previously unavailable. The book deals with the theory of valued fields and mutli-valued fields. The theory of Prüfer rings is discussed from the `geometric' point of view. The author shows that by introducing the Zariski topology on families of valuation rings, it is possible to distinguish two important subfamilies of Prüfer rings that correspond to Boolean and near Boolean families of valuation rings. Also, algebraic and model-theoretic properties of <b>multi-valued</b> <b>fields</b> with near Boolean families of valuation rings satisfying the local-global principle are studied. It is important that this principle is elementary, i. e., it can be expressed in the language of predicate calculus. The most important results obtained in the book include a criterion for the elementarity of an embedding of a <b>multi-valued</b> <b>field</b> and a criterion for the elementary equivalence for <b>multi-valued</b> <b>fields</b> from the class defined by the additional natural elementary conditions (absolute unramification, maximality and almost continuity of local elementary properties). The book concludes with a brief chapter discussing the bibliographic references available on the material presented, and a short history of the major developments within the field...|$|R

40|$|Given a field K with finitely many valuations; does {{there exist}} an {{extension}} of K which at these valuations has a prescribed local behavior? The Grunwald-Wang theorem answers this question {{in the case of}} abelian field extensions. Originally developed for algebraic number elds in the context of class field theory, it has turned out that it is valid quite generally, for arbitrary <b>multi-valued</b> <b>fields,</b> provided the valuations are of rank one or, more generally, are mutually independent and dense in their respective henselizations.

40|$|We {{present in}} this paper the {{numerical}} computation of the <b>multi-valued</b> traveltime <b>field</b> generated by a point source experiment in the Marmousi model. Two recently developed methods are combined to achieve this goal: a method called big ray tracing, used for the computation of <b>multi-valued</b> travel-time <b>fields,</b> and an eikonal solver designed to work on unstructured meshes. Big ray tracing {{is based on a}} combination of ray tracing and local solutions of the eikonal equation. A classical ray tracing first 'discretizes' the phase space and defines local zones which possibly overlap where the travel-time <b>field</b> is <b>multi-valued.</b> An eikonal solver then computes the travel-time in these zones called big rays. It acts as an exact interpolator between rays associated to different branches of the travel-time field.

40|$|A {{transient}} axially symmetric two-phase vortex-ring flow is investigated {{using the}} one-way coupled, two-fluid approach. The carrier phase parameters are calculated using the approximate analytical solution suggested by Kaplanski and Rudi (Phys. Fluids vol. 17 (2005) 087101 - 087107). Due to the vortical {{nature of the}} flow, the mixing of inertial admixture can be accompanied by crossing particle trajectories. The admixture parameters are calculated using the Fully Lagrangian Approach (FLA). According to FLA, all of the dispersed phase parameters, including the particle/droplet concentration, are calculated from {{the solution to the}} system of ordinary differential equations along chosen particle trajectories; FLA provides high-accuracy particle number calculations even in the case of crossing particle trajectories (<b>multi-valued</b> <b>fields</b> of the dispersed media). Two flow regimes corresponding to two different initial conditions are investigated: (i) injection of a two-phase jet; and (ii) propagation of a vortex ring through a cloud of particles. It was shown that the dispersed media may form folds and caustics in these flows. In both cases, the ranges of governing parameters leading to the formation of mushroom-like clouds of particles are identified. The caps of the mushrooms contain caustics or edges of folds of the dispersed media, which correspond to particle accumulation zone...|$|R

40|$|The {{generating}} functional of {{two dimensional}} BF field theories coupled to fermionic fields and conserved currents is computed {{in the general}} case when the base manifold is a genus g compact Riemann surface. The lagrangian density L=dB∧A is written {{in terms of a}} globally defined 1 -form A and a <b>multi-valued</b> scalar <b>field</b> B. Consistency conditions on the periods of dB have to be imposed. It is shown that there exist a non-trivial dependence of the generating functional on the topological restrictions imposed to B. In particular if the periods of the B field are constrained to take values 4 π n, with n any integer, then the partition function is independent of the chosen spin structure and may be written as a sum over all the spin structures associated to the fermions even when one started with a fixed spin structure. These results are then applied to the functional bosonization of fermionic fields on higher genus surfaces. A bosonized form of the partition function which takes care of the chosen spin structure is obtainedComment: 17 page...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} lattice {{formulation}} of noncommutative Yang-Mills theory in arbitrary even dimensionality. The UV/IR mixing characteristic of noncommutative field theories is demonstrated at a completely nonperturbative level. We prove a discrete Morita equivalence between ordinary Yang-Mills theory with <b>multi-valued</b> gauge <b>fields</b> and noncommutative Yang-Mills theory with periodic gauge fields. Using this equivalence, {{we show that}} generic noncommutative gauge theories in the continuum can be regularized nonperturbatively by means of ordinary lattice gauge theory with ’t Hooft flux. In the case of irrational noncommutativity parameters, the rank of the gauge group of the commutative lattice theory must be sent to infinity in the continuum limit. As a special case, the construction includes the recent description of noncommutative Yang-Mills theories using twisted large N reduced models. We study the coupling of noncommutative gauge fields to matter fields in the fundamental representation of the gauge group using the lattice formalism. The large mass expansion is {{used to describe the}} physical meaning of Wilson loops in noncommutative gauge theories. We also demonstrate Morita equivalence in the presence of fundamental matter fields and use this property to comment on the calculation of the beta-function in noncommutative quantum electrodynamics...|$|R

The solutions are represented as the integral curves of a <b>multi-valued</b> `optimal' vector <b>field</b> on state space. Generically, there are three types of integral curves: stable points, open intervals that are forward asymptotic to a stable point and backward asymptotic to an unstable point, and half-open intervals that are forward asymptotic to a stable point and backward asymptotic to an indifference point; the latter are initial states to multiple optimal trajectories. We characterize all bifurcations that occur generically in one- and two-parameter families. Most of these are related to global dynamical bifurcations of the state-costate system of the problem...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this work, {{a reduced}} {{reference}} (RR) perceptual quality metric for color stereoscopic images is presented. Given a reference stereo pair {{of images and}} their ”distorted ” version, we first compute the disparity map of both the reference and the distorted stereoscopic images. To this end, we define a method for color image disparity estimation based on the structure tensors properties and eigenvalues/eigenvectors analysis. Then, we compute the cyclopean images of both the reference and the distorted pairs. Thereafter, we apply a multispectral wavelet decomposition to the two cyclopean color images in order to describe the different channels in the human visual system (HVS). Then, contrast sensitivity function (CSF) filtering is performed to obtain the same visual sensitivity information within the original and the distorted cyclopean images. Thereafter, based on {{the properties of the}} human visual system (HVS), rational sensitivity thresholding is performed to obtain the sensitivity coefficients of the cyclopean images. Finally, RR stereo color image quality assessment (SCIQA) is performed by comparing the sensitivity coefficients of the cyclopean images and studying the coherence between the disparity maps of the reference and the distorted pairs. Experiments performed on color stereoscopic images indicate that the objective scores obtained by the proposed metric agree well with the subjective assessment scores.

40|$|In {{this work}} {{numerical}} simulations {{have been used}} as a tool for understanding the fluid physics that governs the dynamic wetting of single component and surfactant containing liquids. The model problem consists of a plate moving at constant speed through a finite sized rectangular bath containing the liquid. The governing transport equations, with the associated boundary conditions, are solved using the Galerkin finite element method, the Newton 2 ̆ 7 s iterative scheme and a frontal solver. ^ For the single component liquids, numerically computed free surface shapes have been compared with results from a singular perturbation analysis available in the literature. The existence of a geometry free 2 ̆ 7 intermediate 2 ̆ 7 region has been demonstrated at low Capillary numbers (Ca), while at Capillary numbers greater than 10 - 2, such a region does not appear to exist. These results indicate that for Ca 3 ̆c 10 - 2 the interface slope within the intermediate region {{can be used as a}} material boundary condition for the fluid dynamics associated with the 2 ̆ 7 outer 2 ̆ 7 region. ^ Free surface shapes as well as velocity, pressure and concentration fields have been obtained when the liquid is a soluble surfactant solution, for the case of no transfer to the moving plate as well as mapping to the plate. In the latter case, surface diffusion had to be introduced to avoid a <b>multi-valued</b> velocity <b>field</b> at the moving contact line. The loss of surfactant to the plate was modeled as a first order reaction. The strength of the surfactant, surfactant diffusion coefficient, and the magnitude of the rate constant have a dramatic impact on the surfactant concentrations, with concomitant effects on free surface shapes. The key dimensionless groups that influence the variables on the free surface are the surface Peclet number (Pe s), Elasticity number (El), Capillary number (Ca), dimensionless slip length (ls), Surface Diffusion number (R D) and Reaction number (K R). ^ The back leaking of ink in ball-point pen refills has also been experimentally studied and it is shown that the failure is due to the migration of ink in micron sized capillaries on the inner surface of the refills. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare the use of two Object-Relational models against the use of a post-Relational model for a {{realistic}} application. Although real-world applications, in most cases, can be adequately modeled by the Entity-Relationship (ER) model, the transformation to the popular Relational model alters the representation of structures common in reality, like <b>multi-valued</b> and composite <b>fields.</b> Alternative database models have been developed to overcome these shortcomings. Design/methodology/approach – Based on the ER model of a medical application, this paper compares the information representation, manipulation and enforcement of integrity constraints through PostgreSQL and Oracle, against the use of a post-Relational model composed of the Conceptual Universal Database Language (CUDL) and the Conceptual Universal Database Language Abstraction Level (CAL). Findings – The CAL/CUDL pair, although more periphrastic for data definition, is simpler for data insertions, does not require the use of procedural code for data updates, produces clearer output for retrieval of attributes, can accomplish retrieval of rows based on conditions that address composite data with declarative statements and supports data validation for relationships between composite data without the need for procedural code. Research limitations/implications – To verify, in practice, the conclusions of the paper, complete implementation of a CAL/CUDL system is needed. Practical implications – The use of the CAL/CUDL pair would advance the productivity of database application development. Originality/value – This paper highlights the properties of realistic database-applications modelling and management that are desirable by developers and shows that these properties are better satisfied by the CAL/CUDL pair. © 2014, Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|R
40|$|The Morse Theory of {{critical}} points was extended by Palais and Smale {{to a certain}} class of functions on Hilbert manifolds. However, there are many variational problems in a nonlinear setting which for technical reasons are posed not on Hilbert but on Banach manifolds of mappings. The difficulty in extending the previous methods is in giving a proper definition of a nondegenerate critical point and in showing {{the existence of a}} vector field which is transverse to a handle near a critical point. In Hilbert manifolds Riesz representation theorem may guarantee the existence of a gradient vector field and give a suitable definition for nondegeneracy such that the gradient vector field is transverse to a handle near a critical point. But this does not work in a Banach manifold setting. ^ An extension has already been given by Tromba in 1977 by assuming the existence of a gradient-like vector field near critical points. But the existence of a gradient-like vector field gives as inner product structure on the model space. ^ In this paper we introduce a concept of a <b>multi-valued</b> gradient vector <b>field</b> for a function defined on a Banach manifold. Using this concept we generalize the Morse theory to some kind of Banach manifolds. ^ This paper contains three parts. The first chapter gives a definition of nondegeneracy {{of critical}} points for a real valued function defined on a reflexive Banach manifold, and then we are able to obtain a handle-body decomposition theorem and Morse inequalities for this manifold. The second chapter proves the existence of solutions for a differential inclusion for a so-called accretive multi-valued mapping on a Finsler manifold. So we can in the third chapter introduce a definition of nondegeneracy of critical points for a real valued function defined on a general Banach manifold, and furthermore, generalize the Morse handle-body decomposition theorem and the Morse inequalities to the Banach manifold. ...|$|R
