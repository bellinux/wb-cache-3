40|$|Abstract—Energy cost of {{operating}} servers {{is a growing}} con-cern, particularly in data center settings. Even though servers have low utilization they are rarely shut down due to data and performance requirements. Previous work has shown that <b>management</b> <b>processors</b> {{can be used to}} satisfy I/O only requests while allowing servers to sleep, significantly reducing energy usage. By increasing the role of <b>management</b> <b>processors</b> to include the handling of requests with limited computing demands, these ”assist nodes ” can process all request during low-utilization periods while allowing the primary server to be placed in low power mode. We call this approach KnightShift. In this research we implemented a fully-functional prototype of KnightShift to demonstrate its feasibility. We run a real-world workload, WikiBench, and measure a 34 % energy savings while only increasing average request latency by 4 %. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of a multicomputer system depends on the <b>processor</b> <b>management</b> strategy. <b>Processor</b> <b>management</b> deals with <b>processor</b> allocation and job scheduling. Most of the processor allocation and job scheduling schemes proposed in the literature incur high implementation complexity and are therefore impractical to be integrated. In this paper, we propose an integrated <b>processor</b> <b>management</b> scheme that includes a bypass-queue scheduling policy and a fixedorientation allocation algorithm. Both policies have very low complexities and are hence suitable to be integrated. Both policies improve the system performance considerably when applied in isolation. The integrated scheme provides even better performance. 1 Introduction Several processor allocation algorithms have been proposed for the mesh-connected systems in the literature [1] [...] [3].

40|$|International audienceData center {{energy costs}} are growing concern. Many datacenters use direct-attached-storage {{architecture}} where data is distributed across disks attached to several servers. In this organization {{even if a}} server is not utilized {{it can not be}} turned off since each server carries a fraction of the permanent state needed to complete a request. Operating servers at low utilization is very inefficient {{due to the lack of}} energy proportionality. In this research we propose to use outof- band <b>management</b> <b>processor,</b> typically used for remotely managing a server, to satisfy I/O requests from a remote server. By handling requests with limited processing needs, the <b>management</b> <b>processor</b> takes the load off the primary server thereby allowing the primary server to sleep when not actively being used; we call this approach KnightShift.

40|$|Abstract. The {{benefits}} of QoS network features are easily lost when the endnodes are managed by a conventional, best-effort operating system. Schedulers of such operating systems provide only rudimentary tools (like priority adjustment) for <b>processor</b> <b>management.</b> We present here a simple extension to a <b>processor</b> <b>management</b> {{system that allows}} an application to reserve {{a share of the}} processor for a specified interval. The system is targeted at applications with frequently changing resource demands or recurring, though non-periodic resource requests. An example of such an application is a network-aware image search and retrieval system, but other network-aware client-server applications also fall into the same category. The admission control component of the <b>processor</b> <b>management</b> system decides if a resource request can be satisfied. To limit {{the amount of time spent}} negotiating with the operating system, the application can present a ranked list of acceptable reservations. The admission controller then picks the best request that can still be satisfied (using the Simplex linear programming algorithm to find the best solution). If there are insufficient resources, the application must deal with the shortage. Any possible adaptation (if the accepted request was not the application’s first choice) is left to the application. The <b>processor</b> <b>management</b> system has been implemented for NetBSD and been ported to Linux, and the paper includes an evaluation of its effectiveness. The overhead is low, and although reservations are not guaranteed, in practical settings the application almost always obtains the cycles requested. ...|$|R

40|$|In his {{discussion}} - Database As A Tool For Hospitality Management - William O 2 ̆ 7 Brien, Assistant Professor, School of Hospitality Management at Florida International University, O’Brien offers at the outset, “Database systems offer sweeping possibilities for better management {{of information in}} the hospitality industry. The author discusses what such systems are capable of accomplishing. ” The author opens {{with a bit of}} background on database system development, which also lends an impression as to the complexion {{of the rest of the}} article; uh, it’s a shade technical. “In early 1981, Ashton-Tate introduced dBase 11. It was the first microcomputer database <b>management</b> <b>processor</b> to offer relational capabilities and a user-friendly query system combined with a fast, convenient report writer,” O’Brien informs. “When 16 -bit microcomputers such as the IBM PC series were introduced late the following year, more powerful database products followed: dBase 111, Friday!, and Framework. The effect on the entire business community, and the hospitality industry in particular, has been remarkable”, he further offers with his informed outlook. Professor O’Brien offers a few anecdotal situations to illustrate how much a comprehensive data-base system means to a hospitality operation, especially when billing is involved. Although attitudes about computer systems, as well as the systems themselves have changed since this article was written, there is pertinent, fundamental information to be gleaned. In regards to the digression of the personal touch when a customer is engaged with a computer system, O’Brien says, “A modern data processing system should not force an employee to treat valued customers as numbers…” He also cautions, “Any computer system that decreases the availability of the personal touch is simply unacceptable. ” In a system’s ability to process information, O’Brien suggests that in the past businesses were so enamored with just having an automated system that they failed to take full advantage of its capabilities. O’Brien says that a lot of savings, in time and money, went un-noticed and/or under-appreciated. Today, everyone has an integrated system, and the wise business manager is the business manager who takes full advantage of all his resources. O’Brien invokes the 80 / 20 rule, and offers, “…the last 20 percent of results costs 80 percent of the effort. But times have changed. Everyone is automating data management, so that last 20 percent that could be ignored a short time ago represents a significant competitive differential. ” The evolution of data systems takes center stage for much of the article; pitfalls also emerge...|$|E
