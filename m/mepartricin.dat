50|$|<b>Mepartricin</b> is {{estrogen}} reabsorption inhibitor {{that may}} interfere with the reabsorption of estrogens in the gut leading to increased fecal estrogen excretion. It reduces 17 β estradiol concentration in enterohepatic circulation and decreases estrogen levels in the prostate. The effect of <b>mepartricin</b> on the reabsorption of estrogens was evaluated in studies in vitro and in vivo.|$|E

Regarding to the theory that hormonal disorders could promote prostatic inflammation, <b>mepartricin,</b> that can lower estrogen levels in prostate, is effective drug in the treatment of patients with chronic pelvic pain syndrome [...] and is referred in 2015 World Journal Pharmacology Updates on therapies for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome.|$|E

40|$|THE normal defence {{mechanisms}} against {{infection with}} Candida albicans include opsonis-ation, phagocytosis, and subsequent killing by an oxidative mechanism involving hydrogen peroxide and myeloperoxidase. Genetic defects in either peroxide production (Oh et al., 1969) or myeloperoxidase activity (Lehrer and Cline, 1969 a) result in defective killing by polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN). The functional {{integrity of the}} PMN is thus a requirement for elimination of Candida, and drugs {{to be used in}} topical or systemic therapy should not inhibit these phagocytic cells. With this in mind we have studied the possible effects of the polyene antibiotic <b>mepartricin</b> (Bruzzese, Cambieri and Recusani, 1975), which is active against Trichomonas and Candida, on PMN functions in vitro. Like other polyene antibiotics, <b>mepartricin</b> interacts with the sterols present in cell membranes (Pellegrini, Ruozi and De Bernardi, 1974) causing a rapid drop in oxygen consumption by fungal cells (Ritzerfeld, 1972) and changes in the external layers of the cell wall (Ruozi, Zara an...|$|E
40|$|Fifteen {{patients}} {{in various stages}} of benign hypertrophy of the prostate were treated with <b>mepartricin</b> (SPA-S- 160). Three tablets a day were given for a standard period of 60 days. The pharmacological effect of the drug was assessed both by traditional techniques and modern instrumental examinations like transrectal echography and urodynamic analysis. All 15 patients were studied {{on the basis of a}} protocol that incorporated standard diagnostic surveys before the start of treatment, numerous tests after 30 days and at the end of treatment. The overall clinical result was more than satisfactory especially in terms of the reduction in the frequency of daily and nightly urination. The echographic and urodynamic results were less spectacular. The drug was extremely well tolerated...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Chronic prostatitis/chronic {{pelvic pain}} {{syndrome}} (CP/CPPS) {{has been treated}} with several different interventions with limited success. This meta-analysis aims to review all trials reporting on therapeutic intervention for CP/CPPS using the National Institutes of Health-Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI). METHODS: We searched Medline, PubMed, the Cochrane Pain, Palliative & Supportive Care Trials, the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials. gov, and the NIDDK website between 1947 and December 31, 2011 without language or study type restrictions. All RCTs for CP/CPPS lasting at least 6 weeks, {{with a minimum of}} 10 participants per arm, and using the NIH-CPSI score, the criterion standard for CP/CPPS, as an outcome measure were included. Data was extracted from each study by two independent reviewers. Gillbraith and I-squared plots were used for heterogeneity testing and Eggers and Peters methods for publication bias. Quality was assessed using a component approach and meta-regression was used to analyze sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: <b>Mepartricin,</b> percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS), and triple therapy comprised of doxazosin + ibuprofen + thiocolchicoside (DIT) resulted in clinically and statistically significant reduction in NIH-CPSI total score. The same agents and aerobic exercise resulted in clinically and statistically significant NIH-CPSI pain domain score reduction. Acupuncture, DIT, and PTNS were found to produce statistically and clinically significant reductions in the NIH-CPSI voiding domain. A statistically significant placebo effect was found for all outcomes and time analysis showed that efficacy of all treatments increased over time. Alpha-blockers, antibiotics, and combinations of the two failed to show statistically or clinically significant NIH-CPSI reductions. CONCLUSION: Results from this meta-analysis reflect our current inability to effectively manage CP/CPPS. Clinicians and researchers must consider placebo effect and treatment efficacy over time and design studies creatively so we can more fully elucidate the etiology and role of therapeutic intervention in CP/CPPS...|$|E
40|$|Lyme {{disease is}} a leading vector-borne disease in the United States. Although the {{majority}} of Lyme patients can be cured with standard 2 – 4 week antibiotic treatment, 10 %– 20 % of patients continue to suffer from prolonged post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). While the cause for this is unclear, persisting organisms not killed by current Lyme antibiotics may be involved. In our previous study, we screened an FDA drug library and reported 27 top hits that showed high activity against Borrelia persisters. In this study, we present {{the results of an}} additional 113 active hits that have higher activity against the stationary phase B. burgdorferi than the currently used Lyme antibiotics. Many antimicrobial agents (antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, anthelmintics or antiparasitics) used for treating other infections were found to have better activity than the current Lyme antibiotics. These include antibacterials such as rifamycins (3 -formal-rifamycin, rifaximin, rifamycin SV), thiostrepton, quinolone drugs (sarafloxacin, clinafloxacin, tosufloxacin), and cell wall inhibitors carbenicillin, tazobactam, aztreonam; antifungal agents such as fluconazole, <b>mepartricin,</b> bifonazole, climbazole, oxiconazole, nystatin; antiviral agents zanamivir, nevirapine, tilorone; antimalarial agents artemisinin, methylene blue, and quidaldine blue; antihelmintic and antiparasitic agents toltrazuril, tartar emetic, potassium antimonyl tartrate trihydrate, oxantel, closantel, hycanthone, pyrimethamine, and tetramisole. Interestingly, drugs used for treating other non-infectious conditions including verteporfin, oltipraz, pyroglutamic acid, pidolic acid, and dextrorphan tartrate, that act on the glutathione/γ-glutamyl pathway involved in protection against free radical damage, and also the antidepressant drug indatraline, were found to have high activity against stationary phase B. burgdorferi. Among the active hits, agents that affect cell membranes, energy production, and reactive oxygen species production are more active against the B. burgdorferi persisters than the commonly used antibiotics that inhibit macromolecule biosynthesis. Future studies are needed to evaluate and optimize the promising active hits in drug combination studies in vitro and also in vivo in animal models. These studies may have implications for developing more effective treatments of Lyme disease...|$|E
