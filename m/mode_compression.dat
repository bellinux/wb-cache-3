Inter <b>mode</b> <b>compression</b> is able to achieve increased coding efficiency over intra mode schemes. However, in video content production stages, digital video-processing applications require fast-frame random access to perform an undefined number of real-time decompressing-editing-compressing interactive operations, without a significant loss of original video content quality. Intra-frame coding is desirable as well in many other applications like video archiving, high-quality high-resolution medical and satellite video sequences, applications requiring simple real-time encoding like video-conference systems or even for professional or home video surveillance systems [1], and digital video recording systems, where the user equipment is usually not as powerful as the head end equipment.|$|E

40|$|Solar p-mode {{oscillations}} {{are excited}} {{by the work of}} stochastic, non-adiabatic, pressure fluctuations on the compressive modes. We evaluate the expression for the radial mode excitation rate derived by Nordlund & Stein (2000) using numerical simulations of near surface solar convection. We first apply this expression to the three radial modes of the simulation and obtain good agreement between the predicted excitation rate and the actual mode damping rates as determined from their energies and the widths of their resolved spectral profiles. These radial simulation modes are essentially the same as the solar modes at the resonant frequencies, where the solar modes have a node at the depth of the bottom of the simulation domain. We then apply this expression for the mode excitation rate to the solar modes and obtain excellent agreement with the low ℓ damping rates determined from GOLF data. Excitation occurs close to the surface, mainly in the intergranular lanes and near the boundaries of granules (where turbulence and radiative cooling are large). The non-adiabatic pressure fluctuations near the surface are produced by small instantaneous local imbalances between the divergence of the radiative and convective fluxes near the solar surface. Below the surface, the non-adiabatic pressure fluctuations are produced primarily by turbulent pressure fluctuations (Reynolds stresses). The frequency dependence of the mode excitation is due to effects of the mode structure and the pressure fluctuation spectrum. Excitation is small at low frequencies due to mode properties – the <b>mode</b> <b>compression</b> decreases and the mode mass increases at low frequency. Excitation is small at high frequencies due to the pressure fluctuation spectrum – pressure fluctuations become small at high frequencies because they are due to convection which is a long time scale phenomena compared to the dominant p-mode periods.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{extensive}} molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics {{studies on the}} energy, structure, mechanical and vibrational properties of single-wall carbon nanotubes. In our study we employed an accurate interaction potential derived from quantum mechanics. We explored the stability domains of circular and collapsed cross section structures of armchair (n,n), zigzag(n, 0), and chiral (2 n,n) isolated single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) up to a circular cross section radius of 170 Å. We have found three different stability regions based on circular cross section radius. Below 10 Å radius only the circular cross section tubules are stable. Between 10 and 30 Å both circular and collapsed forms are possible, however, the circular cross section SWNTs are energetically favorable. Beyond 30 Å (crossover radius) the collapsed form becomes favorable for all three types of SWNTs. We report {{the behavior of the}} SWNTs with radii close to the crossover radius ((45, 45), (80, 0), (70, 35)) under uniaxial compressive and tensile loads. Using classical thin-plane approximation and variation of strain energy as a function of curvature, we calculated the bending modulus of the SWNTs. The calculated bending moduli are [kappa][sub](n,n) = 963. 44 GPa, [kappa][sub](n, 0) = 911. 64 GPa, and [kappa][sub](2 n,n) = 935. 48 GPa. We also calculated the interlayer spacing between the opposite sides of the tubes and found d[sub](n,n) = 3. 38 angstroms, d[sub](2 n,n) = 3. 39 angstroms, and d[sub](n, 0) = 3. 41 angstroms. Using an enthalpy optimization method, we have determined the crystal structure and Young's modulus of (10, 10) armchair, (17, 0) zigzag and (12, 6) chiral forms (which have similar diameter as (10, 10)). They all pack in a triangular pattern in two dimensions. Calculated lattice parameters are a[sub](10, 10) = 16. 78 angstroms, a[sub](17, 0) = 16. 52 angstroms and a[sub](12, 6) = 16. 52 angstroms.
