Article IX, Section 3, Subsection 1 recognized and confirmed all existing water rights. Subsection 2 reiterated the 1889 constitution's wording, with only minor and non-substantive changes.

500|$|The 1601 Act {{stated that}} {{charities}} {{for the benefit}} of the [...] "aged, impotent and poor people" [...] had an appropriate purpose; it is accepted that these may appear individually. A charity does not have to be {{for the benefit of}} people who are both poor, impotent and aged to be valid, only one of them. [...] "Poverty" [...] is a subjective term, and in Re Coulthurst, Sir Raymond Evershed indicated that it should be treated as such; [...] "poverty, of course, does not mean destitution... it [...] persons who have to 'go short'... due regard being had to their status in life and so forth". This appears to indicate that a millionaire who loses half of his income may be considered [...] "poor", in that he is unable to have the lifestyle he is accustomed to. Some limits were set to this provision by Lord Simonds in IRC v Baddeley, where he wrote that: [...] The gift that creates the charitable trust, whatever the definition of poverty accepted by the courts, <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> the poor and nobody else. In Re Gwyon, money was left to provide short trousers to children in Farnham.

2500|$|Charitable trusts are {{a general}} {{exception}} to the rule in English law that trusts cannot be created for an abstract purpose. The meaning of a charity has been set in statute since the Elizabethan Charitable Uses Act 1601, but the principles are now codified by the Charities Act 2011. Apart from being capable of not having any clear beneficiaries, charitable trusts usually enjoy exemption from taxation on its own capital or income, and people making gifts can deduct the gift from their taxes. Classically, a trust would be charitable if its purpose was promoting reduction of poverty, advancement of education, advancement or religion, or other purposes for the public benefit. The criterion of [...] "public benefit" [...] was the key to being a charity. Courts gradually added specific examples, today codified in the CA 2011 section 3, section 4 emphasises that all purposes <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> the [...] "public benefit". The meaning remains with the courts. In Oppenheim v Tobacco Securities Trust the House of Lords held that an employer's trust for his employees and children was not for the public benefit because of the personal relationship between them. Generally, the trust <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> a [...] "sufficient section of the public" [...] and cannot exclude the poor. However it often unclear how these principles are applicable in practice.|$|E

2500|$|Chapter Five {{engages in}} a Plain-Meaning-Rule {{construction}} {{of the language of}} Section 7(a) and the NLRA. [...] Morris examines Section 7, Section 8(a)(1), Section 9(a), and Section 8(a)(5) of the NLRB for their plain meaning, and concludes they guarantee the right of all employees to bargain collectively, whether before or after majority-union designation. [...] Bargaining before such selection <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> members-only through a union of the employees' choice; bargaining after majority selection <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> all employees in the bargaining unit through the selected union only. [...] This chapter provides the heart of Morris' thesis, for although it is supported by legislative history (and constitutional and international law), its primary basis is contained in the unambiguous text of the statute. [...] The critical language is short, simple, and of clear meaning. [...] Fourteen words in Section 7, borrowed verbatim from Section 7(a) of the NIRA, provide that [...] "Employees shall have the right...to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing...." [...] This is guaranteed and enforced by Section 8(a)(1) and reinforced by Section 8(a)(5) (which by its clear wording and its [...] "smoking gun" [...] legislative history requires bargaining both before and after majority selection). [...] The only limitation on this bargaining right is a conditional limitation on the choice of representatives, but not on the duty to bargain. [...] This limitation is contained in Section 9(a) which does not operate unless there is a majority representative, in which event the selected majority union becomes the exclusive representative. [...] Morris points out that both the Supreme Court and the NLRB have approved minority and members only bargaining and resulting members-only contracts where they exist voluntarily, and that the time is now ripe for a decision confirming that such bargaining is enforceable where there is not yet a majority representative. [...] This universal concept of collective bargaining conforms to the [...] "policy of the United States" [...] expressed in Section 1 of the Act, which policy was expressly reconfirmed in the Taft-Hartley Act.|$|E
