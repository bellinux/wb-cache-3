TITLE: An Evaluation of Growth Simulation Models for Non-Industrial Private Forest Stewardship Planning in Southern Illinois MAJOR PROFESSOR: DR: Andrew Carver After timber is harvested, changes occur {{that should be}} recorded to provide guidelines and justification for future forest stewardship practices. In 1997, an inventory of the Scherrer property timber was conducted in order to record the impacts that might result in changes in a stand following a timber harvest and a timber stand improvement project. The timber was harvested {{in the summer of}} 1998 using a 20 -inch diameter limit, with a lower limit on sugar maples and hickory species. Pre-harvest and post-harvest data were collected using a Biltmore Cruising Stick, diameter tape, 1002 ̆ 7 tape measure, forester 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>compass,</b> and a 10 -factor wedge prism. Pre-harvest data was collected on 71 plots, and post-harvest data was collected on 61 plots. The data were analyzed using the SILVAH computer program for pre-harvest and post-harvest data. The Ned program was used to run four growth simulators. The growth simulators used were FIBER, NW-TWIGS, SILVAH, and OAKSIM, each programmed for a five year time horizon after harvest. The actual relative density measured before treatment was 77 percent per acre. The field-measured post-harvest density decreased to 57 percent. The computer simulated relative density ranged between 31 to 69 percent per acre. The pre-harvest board-foot volume was 8266 International ¼ 2 ̆ 7 scale. The actual field-measured post-harvest volume was 6591 board feet per acre. The range for simulated boardfoot volumes was 2395 to 6295 board feet per acre. The results of the study support the validity of using the NW-TWIGS simulator for stewardship planning in Southern Illinois. The NW-TWIGS model yielded results closest to the actual field measurements. FIBER and SILVAH produced the same result. OAKSIM was the least. A study of the hardwood regeneration indicates that, at present, ash is the dominant species overall. The white oak, hickory, sugar maple, and black oak volumes decreased in composition within stands. Ash, northern red oak, cherrybark oak, sweetgum, and beech composition remained largely unchanged. Whereas yellow poplar, black walnut and the chestnut oak group increased in percent presence within stands...|$|R

Empirically, we have determined that after 8 hours at an ambient temperature of 25 C, the average light output of an incandescent cap lamp can decrease to about 69 % of its initial value when powered by a lead-acid battery and it can decrease to about 65 % of its initial value when powered by a nickel-hydride battery. An LED-based cap lamp using a constant current drive circuit can maintain about 96 % of its initial value when powered by a nickel-hydride battery. Real-world tests addressing the effects of ambient temperature and airflow on the light output of an LED and incandescent cap lamp were conducted in the NIOSH Safety Research Coal Mine (SRCM). The LED cap lamp yielded a vertical average illuminance improvement of approximately 9. 5 % and the INC cap lamp yielded a vertical average illuminance degradation o f approximately 4 %. The differences between LED and incandescent cap lamps were further quantified by the calculation of mesopic luminance data that indicated for the same photopic luminance (i. e., as measured using a conventional light meter) the LED cap lamp could be up to 38 % more efficient than the incandescent cap lamp with a lead-acid battery {{at the end of the}} 10 -hour driving cycle.

40|$|SummaryDrilling {{operations}} {{are a significant}} cost {{in the process of}} recovering hydrocarbons. The {{operations are}} advanced and associated with large HSE and financial risks. The main objectives in a successful drilling operation are to construct safe and economically efficient wells, but the success also depends on hitting the target. As the drilling operation has very high standards of execution, a good drilling operation depends on a good well plan. The planning phase is a large and complex process as it engineers all aspects of a drilling operation. This is key to create safe and economically efficient wells. Well trajectory planning is a mixture of many parameters but in the end it comes down to identifying the most optimum well path. That means they should be based on exact mathematical calculation models, to precisely calculate well bore trajectories. The industry uses a number of different planning tools that makes it possible to calculate and plan complex well path trajectories. Very few studies have addressed this topic in a systematic manner. In this thesis, a large study has been made on the background of well planning and the well planning software s used in the industry today. The industry leader within well planning software is Halliburton Landmark <b>s</b> <b>Compass.</b> Compass {{has been used as a}} base study in this thesis. Work presented, has looked at three essential parts of the well planning software. 1. 	The Software Model 2. 	The Calculation Models 3. 	The FunctionsThe main objective of this thesis has been to identify the different calculation models used in these programs and to program suitable functions similar to those found in existing planning softwares, in an attempt to create a new and more user friendly well planning software. Also, there is not much in the literature or information supporting what the different software models do to create well paths so a better understanding of the engineering of 3 D well paths has been developed. A study was done to find/map different calculation methods that develop precise wellbore coordinates. A number of calculation models were found, but the bulk of these models is presented as models that are used to calculate already drilled wells. However, two new methods were identified. The method called Exact departures, Constant Turn Rate Method was found to give accurate results and is also the main calculation model found in the well planning softwares. This is the main calculation model used to support the functions presented in this thesis. The major part of the work presented in this thesis relates to the construction of precise and user friendly functions, that allow calculation of exact well paths. Using Compass as an offset to calibrate the programmed models, a substantial study has been done to understand and identify assumptions and how the presented functions work in Compass. The result is accurate program functions. The results show exact and accurate calculations - identical to compass. This thesis also presents the basics behind the operational phase, including surveying and anti-collision. Some work is left for further investigation. In the process of constructing a new well planning tool, a software or platform has to be programed to implement the functions presented in this thesis. Some of the functions presented also have some limitations that have to be finalized. Furthermore, more functions have to be developed, and programing of a plotting tool is also left for further work...|$|R

While these questions will always carry everyday emphasis at the mine, they are fundamentally lacking in that they often appear, especially to lower levels of management and to the production worker, as preeminent concerns. Driven by market economics, many organizations have decentralized, outsourced, downsized, restructured, and formed new coalitions. Investments in new technology and concentration on productivity have been part and parcel with these changes, contributing to improvements in both safety and efficiency. A reason for (and, perhaps a result of) these improvements has been {{the development of a}} highly experienced and flexible work force. These changes in mining present an interesting opportunity to modify a few paradigms about work life in general, and perhaps a few paradigms about how we invest in the miner, in particular. Studying these issues now might offer some interesting opportunities for the future, as the foundations {{for the next generation of}} mine workers are laid. With the average "experienced" U. <b>S.</b> <b>miner</b> five to fifteen years from retirement, perhaps a key determinant of future success in the world market might be how well we make the transition from today's work force to the work force of tomorrow. We can ill afford to wait a few more years to tap into the special knowledge residing within a veteran mining work force. The WCPM work Crew Performance Model, see pp.) is one approach to defining, capturing, and transferring this expertise...|$|R
40|$|This Information Circular {{from the}} National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{documents}} and supplements {{the information presented}} {{in a series of}} workshops held during 2002 and 2003. The primary intended audience consists of all who are involved in developing and conducting miners' training. According to the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), mine operators reported 240, 000 full-time equivalent workers and independent contractors reported 42, 000 full-time equivalent workers working on mine property during the year 2000. Unfortunately, these workers have a relatively high risk of suffering serious work-related injuries and illnesses. The mining industry has the highest rate of occupational fatalities among all U. S. industries. The fatality rate is 30 deaths per 100, 000 workers compared to 4. 6 for all private industry (Morbidity and Mortality Week Report, 2001; NIOSH, 2002). Compared to workers in other industries, miners also have a relatively high rate of nonfatal lost-time injuries, and their injuries tend to be more severe (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1999). Many miners are also exposed to significant health hazards, including coal and silica dust, diesel exhaust, and noise. More than 1000 U. <b>S.</b> <b>miners</b> die of lung disease each year (NIOSH, 1999). Mine safety and health professionals have long recognized training as a critical element of an effective safety and health program. Federal regulations (30 CFR, Parts 46 and 48) require mine operators to provide initial safety and health training to all new miners, as well as a minimum of 8 hours of refresher training each year. The time and money being spent to train U. <b>S.</b> <b>miners</b> is substantial, and so there is a strong and steady demand for new and better mine training materials and methods. A growing concern among mine safety professionals regards the training of new workers. A major change in the mining workforce is anticipated within the next decade. In major segments of mining, especially coal, relatively few workers have been hired since the 1970 's. Thus, as an entire cohort of miners in the current workforce nears retirement, the replacement of these employees will require an influx of new workers. New miners may be young people who lack the ability to recognize and respond to mining hazards in an appropriate manner. They may also have had different educational experiences than their older counterparts. Many safety professionals believe that these two cohorts require different approaches to training. The papers in this report should help prepare mine trainers for the changes about to occur in the workforce and acquaint them with strategies they can use to enhance the effectiveness of their training. The first three papers present basic principles for teaching adults. The five remaining papers are intended to illustrate how these principles {{can be applied to the}} development and imple 2 of effective training for miners. Below is an overview of these papers. 1. Kowalski and Vaught review the process and principles of adult learning. The learning model they present includes a discussion of goals, content, delivery, assessment, and remediation. Adults are viewed as active learners, experienced-based, expert in their own right in specific areas, independent, real-life centered, task-centered, problem-centered, solution-driven, skill-seeking, self-directing, and internally and externally motivated. Basic aspects of curriculum development are briefly reviewed. For further information about adult learning, see Camm and Cullen's paper. 2. Mallett and Reinke's first paper discusses issues related to training new miners who have recently or will soon be entering the mining workforce. These new generations of miners have different learning style preferences and training needs than Baby Boomers and other older miners. Even trainers who have been highly effective in the past should reassess their training styles and their classroom materials to...|$|R
40|$|Longwall mining {{has gained}} the {{reputation}} {{as being the}} safest extraction method in underground coal mines. However, {{one of the most}} difficult tasks associated with longwall mining is moving the face once a panel is completed. Based on Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) fatality reports since 1996, longwall face recovery operations have claimed the lives of 5 U. <b>S.</b> <b>miners</b> and have resulted in numerous injuries. Recovery operations can be hazardous because they involve moving large pieces of equipment in very confined spaces. They are also conducted in highly stressed ground conditions due to front abutment loads generated by panel extraction. Shield removal is the most hazardous operation during face recovery because miners are constantly exposed to the unpredictable gob edge. To protect the miners, one or more walking shields, cribbing and/or other supplemental roof and standing supports are typically employed as breaker line supports as each shield is removed. At the Harris No. 1 Mine in southern WV, mobile roof supports (MRS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s) have been used in lieu of traditional walking shields on 17 face moves since 1997. MRS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s are shield-like support units mounted on crawler tracks and are commonly used during room-and-pillar retreat mining operations. For longwall recovery, the two biggest advantages that MRS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s have over traditional walking shields are that they are remotely controlled and are highly maneuverable. MRS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s have contributed to safer shield recovery and shorter move times at the Harris No. 1 Mine. This paper will address both the safety and the operational issues associated with MRS usage during shield recovery. It will also discuss new developments, including the use of the inherently safer battery powered MRS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s, which have been recently certified by the Mine Safety and Health Administration...|$|R

40|$|This {{publication}} {{provides an}} historical overview of research {{undertaken by the}} U. S. federal government over the last 100 years to improve {{the health and safety}} of our nation 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 <b>s</b> <b>miners.</b> Federal research efforts began with the establishment of the U. S. Bureau of Mines (USBM, or the Bureau) in 1910. They have continued over the past century, even after the Bureau 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s closure in 1996. It is hoped that this publication will give the reader an appreciation for the work of mining health and safety researchers over the past century, and of the miners served by this research. Although not a comprehensive history, this report highlights the key organizational changes made within the Bureau and the federal government that affected mining safety and health research. Some mention is also made of Bureau research not directly related to mining health and safety. Note that the work classified as safety and health research has varied over the last century. For example, before 1970 the Bureau separated mining research and safety and health research. At that time, mining research included ground control and methane drainage because they had direct implications for mine safety. Explosives research was also reported separately from health and safety, even though permissible explosives research was obviously related to safety. Therefore, where budget figures from the Bureau are mentioned in this report, it is often not possible to separate safety and health research from other types of research. This history is generally chronological, with a few exceptions. Because of their prominence and direct links to Bureau research, most of the Public Health Service mining studies completed before 1970, when NIOSH was established, will be discussed in a single section, even though the work spanned many decades. Likewise, for convenience, the brief histories of the Bureau 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s mining research centers are located in one section...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundHome {{care workers}} are a high-risk group for injury and illness. Their unique work {{structure}} presents challenges to delivering {{a program to}} enhance their health and safety. No randomized controlled trials have assessed {{the impact of a}} Total Worker Health 22 ̆ 01 e 2 program designed for their needs. Methods/designThe COMPASS (COMmunity of Practice And Safety Support) study is a cluster randomized trial being implemented among Oregon 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s unionized home care workers. Partnering with the Oregon Home Care Commission allowed recruiting 10 pairs of home care worker groups with 8 participants per group (n = 160) for balanced randomization of groups to intervention and control conditions. Physiologic and survey evaluation of all participants will be at enrollment, 620 months and 1220 months. Primary outcomes are to increase health promoting (for example, healthy nutrition and regular physical activity) and health protecting (that is, safety) behaviors. In addition to assessing outcomes adjusted for the hierarchical design, mediation analyses will be used to deconstruct and confirm the program 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s theoretical underpinnings and intervention processes. Intervention groups will participate in a series of monthly 2 -hour meetings designed as ritualized, scripted peer-led sessions to increase knowledge, practice skills and build support for healthy actions. Self-monitoring and individual and team level goals are included to augment change. Because generalizability, reach and achieving dissemination are priorities, following initial wave findings, a second wave of COMPASS groups will be recruited and enrolled with tailoring of the program to align with existing Home Care Commission educational offerings. Outcomes, process and mediation of those tailored groups will be compared with the original wave 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 <b>s</b> findings. DiscussionThe <b>COMPASS</b> trial will assess a novel program to enhance the safety and health of a vulnerable, rapidly expanding group of isolated caregivers, whose critical work allows independent living of frail seniors and the disabled.
