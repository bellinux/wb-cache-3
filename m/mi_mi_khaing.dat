Than E got a reply from All India Radio asking her to come for an {{interview}} in Delhi. <b>Mi</b> <b>Mi</b> <b>Khaing</b> also got a letter from the principal of the Lady Irwin College for Women in New Delhi. They took a train to New Delhi and went to their respective interviews. They both got job offers. Than E was engaged to start up the Burmese language service of the newly established External Services of All India Radio. Her task was to broadcast to territories under Japanese occupation, which included Burma. [...] <b>Mi</b> <b>Mi</b> <b>Khaing,</b> however, decided to work for the British Information Service instead of the lectureship offered by the Lady Irwin College. <b>Mi</b> <b>Mi</b> <b>Khaing</b> married Sao Saimong who spoke fluent Thai.

50|$|Although {{they were}} still Wasbees and still under their strict orders, Than E and <b>Mi</b> <b>Mi</b> <b>Khaing</b> took the {{opportunity}} to contct the editor of the Statesman. At that time in India, everyone was eager to have a firsthand news about what was happening in Burma. The Scottish editor and his Bengali wife invited them to dinner at their house. Over dinner, they told the host and hostess that they were looking for jobs. The editor said that the All India Radio (AIR) was about to begin a new service called External Services to broadcast to countries outside of India. He gave the number of the official to contact. They were lucky to find such friendly and useful people at their first try. The Wasbees were supplied with warm clothes and sent to Delhi and then to Simla.|$|E

Than E joined the Women's Auxiliary Service (Burma) (known as WAS(B)), Than E was in motor unit and had to drive a jeep for some officers on official duty. On 22 February 1942, two retreating brigades of the 17th Indian Division were lost due to the premature demolition of the bridge at the Battle of Sittang Bridge. Realizing Rangoon could not be defended, General Harold Alexander ordered the evacuation of Rangoon after the ports and oil refineries had been destroyed. Than E's unit was to retreat to Mandalay and Maymyo (Pyin Oo Lwin). But before they could go there, the Japanese bombers destroyed the trains bound for Taungoo. At the last minute, the high command decided the WAS(B) unit would leave for India on the latest troop ship that brought in reinforcements. Than E's friend <b>Mi</b> <b>Mi</b> <b>Khaing,</b> who had an officer rank, shared a cabin on the ship with Than E. The trip took much longer than usual due to threats of Japanese submarine attacks.
