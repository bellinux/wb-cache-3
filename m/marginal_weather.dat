40|$|Forecaster {{perceptions}} of major convective outbreaks include {{the notion that}} these events occur within relatively large regions of meteorological conditions favorable {{for the development of}} significant severe weather, particularly tornadoes. With recent studies developing a rigorous and scientifically repeatable method of identifying these events and distinguishing them from intermediate or <b>marginal</b> severe <b>weather</b> outbreaks, the investigation of a large sample of these events now is possible. This diagnostic study aims {{to determine the extent to}} which the use of areal coverage is successful as a means of discriminating major severe weather outbreaks (primarily but not exclusively major tornado outbreaks) from the less significant outbreaks. Preliminary findings suggest that the areal coverage of severe weather parameters favorable for severe weather indeed is associated with the severity of outbreaks. However, the method produces a substantial number of less significant outbreaks that are misclassified as major severe weather outbreaks. Many of these false alarms can be identified by the presence of synoptic environments that are less favorable for the development of a large number of tornadoes. However, a substantial number of intermediate and <b>marginal</b> severe <b>weather</b> outbreaks feature synoptic patterns and mesoscale environments that are difficult to differentiate from the major events.

50|$|The {{morning of}} June 16 was marked only by {{isolated}} storms in the Nebraska area with only <b>marginal</b> severe <b>weather.</b> Beginning at around 0800 UTC, however, favorable conditions for severe weather, particularly for large hail, {{began to build}} across central Nebraska. Moisture from the Gulf of Mexico began to make its way into southern Nebraska and over Kansas, raising dew points over the region. In addition, the prevalence of altocumulus castellanus clouds was an indicator for additional severe weather later in the day. The flow of moisture into the region was further enhanced by an eastward progressing warm front, and at 1200 UTC on June 16, the SPC once again issued a slight risk for severe weather for the eastern halves of South Dakota, Nebraska, and extending eastward into the western Great Lakes region. This was followed shortly after by the day's first severe thunderstorm watch, issued for primarily eastern Nebraska {{in response to a}} developing line of supercells. An hour later, the SPC upgraded some areas previously under a slight risk for severe weather to a moderate risk as a result of continuously increasing moisture content and CAPE in the atmosphere. At 1613 UTC, the SPC issued the first of three public severe weather outlooks for the day, covering a region centered on Sioux City, South Dakota. A Particularly Dangerous Situation tornado watch was issued later that afternoon, and a powerful cyclic supercell developed in Nebraska. This supercell went on to produce a family of six tornadoes, including four EF4s that affected areas in and around Stanton, Pilger, and Wakefield, Nebraska.

40|$|Tornadoes {{that occur}} in close {{proximity}} to midlevel closed lows with a core of cold temperatures aloft are not uncommon, particularly in the central United States. Although several informal studies have shown that severe weather and tornadoes can occur with these midlevel lows, {{little in the way of}} formal work has been published documenting features and ingredients of such systems, especially those that produce what are sometimes called cold core tornadoes. Of particular concern is that these tornadoes can be associated with surface and low-level moisture that appears deceptively small or <b>marginal</b> regarding severe <b>weather</b> po-tential, yet on occasion tornadoes of F 2 or greater intensity can develop. In other cases, vertical shear may appear relatively weak at locations close to the midlevel low, suggesting little potential for tornadoes.

40|$|Travel along unpaved roads is {{not always}} assured, because of their low standards, poor riding quality, impassability in wet weather, and the danger in the {{quantity}} of dust that is generated by moving vehicles and wind. Stabilisation with electrochemical-based non-traditional soil stabilisation additives (chemical additives) may offer {{a solution to this}} continual problem. The objective {{of this paper is to}} report on the strength behaviour of a typical <b>marginal</b> quality <b>weathered</b> quartz gravel material treated with two electrochemical-based non-traditional soil stabilisation additives, enzyme and sulphonated oil to assess their potential value for unpaved road construction under wet and dry conditions. These treated panels were trafficked under 100 vehicles per day. The evaluation was done by means of laboratory tests and field investigations for three years. The characteristics of the natural material and the binding ability of the non-traditional soil stabilisation additives were established from the laboratory testing. Density and moisture, and the strength development of the treated material were determined from field investigations. These two non-traditional soil stabilisation additives appear to have affected the particles and their water component, hence an increase in densities was achieved. The degree of formation and paste surrounding the particles appeared to have varied with time and differed between the additives. An increase in density in the sulphonated oil additive treated panel occurred three months after construction, and a further increase was again noticed eight months after construction (five months thereafter). Up to eight months after construction, the enzyme additive treated panel showed a significant decrease in density, but showed a slight increase thirty-one months after construction. This increase in densities might probably be because of further densification by traffic. The variations in density were attributed to testing variability. In the in situ and soaked DCP-CBR strength measurements, the sulphonated oil additive treated panel reached its maximum in situ strength at two months after construction, while the enzyme additive treated panel reached its maximum in situ strength at five months after construction. Up to eight months after construction, both treated panels indicated a significant decrease in both the in situ and soaked DCP-CBR strength conditions. The decrease was attributed to rain. There was, however, little evidence to show that the additives had improved the material, with the control panel being consistently stronger in both the in situ and soaked DCP-CBR conditions. The importance of considering the time factor in the strength development of non-traditional stabilisation test techniques, as well as the number of tests, was highlighted in the results of this study. The natural variability of the materials used in this type of study is generally high, and the precision of the test method is typically quite low. On this basis, it is usually difficult to draw definite conclusions. This paper is based on the first author’s MSc in Applied Science project report submitted to the University of Pretoria.

40|$|Human {{behaviour}} produces massive {{greenhouse gas}} emissions, which trigger {{climate change and}} more unpredictable weather conditions. The fluctuation of daily weather corresponds to variations of everyday travel behaviour. This influence, although is less noticeable, can have a strong impact on the transport system. Specifically, the climate in Sweden is becoming warmer in the recent 10 years. However, it is largely unknown {{to what extent the}} change of travel behaviour would respond to the changing weather. Understanding these issues would help analysts and policy makers incorporate local weather and climate within our policy design and infrastructure management. The thesis contains eight papers exploring the weather and climate impacts on individual travel behaviour, each addressing a subset of this topic. Paper I explores the weather impact on individual’s mode choice decisions. In paper II and III, individual’s daily activity time, number of trips/trip chains, travel time and mode shares are jointly modelled. The results highlight the importance of modelling activity-travel variables for different trip purposes respectively. Paper IV develops a namely nested multivariate Tobit model to model activity time allocation trade-offs. In paper V, the roles of weather on trip chaining complexity is explored. A thermal index is introduced to better approximate the effects of the thermal environment. In paper VI, the role of subjective weather perception is investigated. Results confirm that individuals with different socio-demographics would have different subjective weather perception even given similar weather conditions.

40|$|The general {{theme of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is the study of}} impacts of weather variability on crop yields, with each chapter addressing a specific topic related to this theme. Chapter 2 tests the hypothesis that corn and soybeans have become more drought tolerant by regressing county yields on a drought index and time. Results indicate that corn yield losses from drought of a given severity, whether measured in quantity terms or as a percentage of mean yields, have decreased over time. Soybean percentage yield losses have also declined but absolute losses have remained largely constant. The potential impact of increased drought tolerance on U. S. crop insurance rates is illustrated by comparing Group Risk Plan (GRP) premium rates assuming time-invariant susceptibility to drought with rates generated from regression results in this dissertation. Chapter 3 develops a linear spline model with endogenous knots to capture the non-linear impacts of rainfall and temperature on corn yields. A hierarchical structure is applied to capture the county-specific factors determining corn yields. Using Bayesian techniques, the thresholds and other model parameters are simultaneously estimated. Gibbs sampling and the Metropolis - Hastings algorithm are applied to estimate the posterior distributions. Corn yield decreases significantly above the upper temperature threshold and below the lower rainfall threshold. Results indicate a geographically clustering pattern of how corn yields respond to changes in temperature and rainfall. Chapter 4 applies the linear spline yield model developed in chapter 3 to examine weather impacts on yield trend, yield risk, and the distribution of corn yield. The climate trend from 1980 to 2009 explains up to 20 % of observed yield trend. Not controlling for temporal weather patters leads to biased trend estimates, especially for short times series. Isolating changes in weather variability in the sample period, the hypothesis of constant coefficient of variation is rejected in most states in the Corn Belt. Decreasing <b>marginal</b> benefit of <b>weather</b> partly explains why corn yield is negatively skewed. Conditional on weather, the distribution of unexplained residuals from our yield model is symmetric in general...|$|R
40|$|International audienceXanthomonas axonopodis pv. dieffenbachiae, {{the causal}} agent of {{bacterial}} blight of aroids (BBA), {{has been reported}} in many regions and has been isolated on several host genera (1). During February 2004, in a nursery (Mont Dore) in New Caledonia, suspect symptoms have been observed on anthurium and dieffenbachia plants. A survey carried out on the entire island revealed that X. axonopodis pv. dieffenbachiae was present in 41 of the 89 nurseries inspected. During hot and humid <b>weather,</b> <b>marginal</b> or interveinal water-soaked spots surrounded by chlorotic or necrotic areas were observed, usually followed by a systemic phase (stem rotting and death of the plant). During the cold and dry season, only water-soaked spots were observed. Seventy pure cultures isolated from anthurium and dieffenbachia were gram negative, yellow pigmented, and had a mucoid aspect when grown on rich media. All strains responded positively to the Xcd 108 monoclonal antibody (Agdia Inc., Elkhart, IN) raised against X. axonopodis pv. dieffenbachiae using indirect ELISA. A set of 18 strains (isolated from 15 anthurium and 3 dieffenbachia plants located in different sites) were further characterized by molecular and pathogenicity tests. All strains reacted positively using a specific nested PCR assay (1). Pathogenicity tests were performed on 8 -month-old plants of Anthurium andreanum ‘Carré’, Dieffenbachia maculata ‘Tropic Marianne’, and Syngonium podophyllum ‘Robusta’ by syringue infiltration of a suspension containing approximately 105 CFU mL- 1. Each strain was inoculated onto three young leaves (four inoculation sites per leaf) on two plants. Control plants received sterile Tris buffer solution (10 mM, pH 7. 2). Plants were maintained in a growth chamber with day and night temperatures of 30 ± 1 °C and 26 ± 1 °C, respectively, 95 ± 5 % relative humidity, 30 μmol m- 2 ·s- 1 light intensity and a photoperiod of 12 h (1). On all plants, all strains caused typical water-soaked symptoms within 10 days, evolving into chlorotic then necrotic areas after 20 to 24 days. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers revealed three haplotypes among these strains, which suggests that several introduction events may have occurred. These AFLP fingerprints were compared with other Xanthomonas spp. pathovars, including most of X. axonopodis pv. dieffenbachiae strains obtained from international culture collections, and were found to belong to the same genomic group as all the X. axonopodis pv. dieffenbachiae strains pathogenic on anthurium. Importation in New Caledonia of aroids from countries in which X. axonopodis pv. dieffenbachiae is present (Hawaii, French Polynesia, the Netherlands, and Australia) occurred before 2004. The wide distribution of BBA is very likely due to the plant material movements occurring in New Caledonia and suggests that the pathogen may have been present on the territory some years before the first official case...|$|R
40|$|The {{overriding}} {{theme of}} my dissertation {{is the use}} of short-term weather fluctuations to study how people allocate their time across activities. In Chapter 1, a theoretical model is developed to distinguish malfeasant from legitimate forms of employee sickness absenteeism. In this model, individuals' marginal utility of indoor leisure is increasing in their sickness levels, while their marginal utility of outdoor leisure is an increasing function of the interaction of their health and the quality of outdoor weather. In equilibrium, sickness absenteeism occurs {{at both ends of the}} sickness distribution [...] among the relatively sick and among the most healthy facing the best weather. The positive relation between <b>marginal</b> changes in <b>weather</b> quality and levels of sickness absenteeism in the workplace reflects the substitution of the inframarginal employees who are the least sick away from work activities towards outdoor leisure activities. The model in Chapter 1 suggests an empirical strategy to identify a shirking component in overall reported sickness absenteeism. Not only does this approach avoid attributing entirely legitimate forms of absenteeism to shirking, but unlike previous studies using employee dismissal rates, it is able to distinguish shirking activity whether or not that activity is detected by employers. In order to exploit exogenous weather fluctuations to identify shirking activity, we need a one-dimensional measure of weather “quality”. The primary objective of Chapter 2 is to construct a weather quality index that captures the influence of the weather on workers' preferences for outdoor leisure activity. The weather quality index takes into account the multifaceted nature of weather conditions, and measures how various weather elements [...] temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and cloud cover [...] come together to affect the propensity of employees to engage in high-utility outdoor recreational activities. The resulting index provides a ranking of different weather conditions in terms of their outdoor recreational values, which can then be used to capture the incentives of employees to shirk contractual work hours in response to purely exogenous weather changes. Chapter 3 empirically tests the existence of weather-induced substitution between work and outdoor leisure activities and examines how this type of behaviour varies across workers facing different shirking incentives. Linking 12 years of employee data from Canada's monthly Labour Force Survey (LFS), which queries reasons for employees' absences, to weather quality measured using the index constructed in Chapter 2, a clear positive relationship is found between the quality of outside weather conditions and short-term reported sickness absenteeism. Moreover, consistent with a key proposition of the theoretical model in Chapter 1, the empirical relation between weather and sickness absenteeism tends to be larger when existing shirking incentives are low, such as when sick pay is less generous and when probability of getting fired if caught shirking is high. There is, however, little evidence that firms are able to adjust shirking incentives through the payment of efficiency wages. Finally, Chapter 4 examines another type of substitution induced by weather shocks [...] the substitution between outdoor and indoor physical activities. The Chapter begins with a theoretical model of the decision to participate in physical activities, which assumes that when adverse weather shocks deter outdoor physical activities, indoor physical activities are the only viable option for individuals to stay physically active. However, because the indoor options are more costly, substituting from outdoor to indoor physical activities is easier for higher-income individuals. This suggests an explanation for the stylized fact that rates of physical activity participation are low among lower socioeconomic groups. Linking time-use data from Canadian General Social Survey with archival weather data, the results of the empirical analysis in this chapter provides evidence of a positive income effect enabling substitution from outdoor to indoor physical activities when outside weather is not conducive for participating in outdoor activities. By exploiting the role that income plays in maintaining physical activity levels when less costly outdoor options are limited, this chapter formally illustrates a credible causal link between people's income levels and their participation in leisure time physical activities and provides direct evidence of this link. The results have important policy implications for promoting physical activities, especially among lower income population...|$|R
50|$|The {{lack of a}} usable IFR {{infrastructure}} and radar coverage combined with the harsh weather conditions caused Alaska {{to have a high}} rate of CFIT accidents. Pilots, departing for VFR-only destinations with the intention of maintaining visual separation with terrain or water, continued flying toward their destination after encountering <b>marginal</b> <b>weather</b> conditions which would normally involve instrument flight operations. The terrain-awareness function of the Capstone avionics provided ground-proximity functionality. The terrain function showed terrain via an intuitive high-resolution color display using black, green, yellow and red to indicate the proximity of terrain to the aircraft. The avionics continuously monitored the aircraft's altitude, GPS-derived position, ground speed, route of flight, and compared this data to a built-in database of terrain elevation. The display automatically provided a terrain advisory to the pilot if the aircraft was within two minutes of a close encounter with the ground.|$|E
5000|$|The {{remaining}} deployed aircraft flew as Operation Mule Train, {{which was}} intended to provide the Army of the Republic of Viet Nam (ARVN) with an assault capability with either airdrop or insertion. However, once in place, the unit also filled the need for logistic support to remote sites throughout the country. Mule Train crews often had to operate independently with little air traffic control under <b>marginal</b> <b>weather</b> conditions, flying {{in and out of}} small fields located in mountainous areas. In June the squadron was augmented by the 777th Troop Carrier Squadron. The Air Force placed great confidence in young Mule Train aircraft commanders, many of them first lieutenants. They were given authority to conduct operations with little oversight. Two Mule Train aircraft were maintained at Da Nang Air Base (at first referred to by its French name of Tourane Airport) to support northern outposts ...|$|E
50|$|By 1960, the {{squadron}} had transitioned into the autopilot equipped HSS-1N {{version of the}} Seabat giving it the ability to operate at night and in <b>marginal</b> <b>weather.</b> In addition to being the first HS squadron on the West Coast, by 1962 HS-2 was the first ASW helicopter squadron to make a deployment with the Navy's first turbine powered all-weather ASW helicopter, the HSS-2 Sea King which in September 1962 {{in compliance with the}} 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system was re-designated the SH-3A Sea King. HS-2 was also the first H-3 squadron to operationally employ Helicopter In-flight Refueling (HIFR) at night. In November 1965, an HS-2 SH-3A performed the longest operational flight at the time. The aircraft remained airborne for eleven hours and eighteen minutes on a search and rescue mission in North Vietnam with the help of four HIFRs three of which were at night. This flight was also the first night rescue in North Vietnam.|$|E
50|$|Glider Pilots {{deployed}} under USAAF's Troop Carrier Command, {{and were}} tasked to deliver personnel and cargo deep into enemy-held territory aboard cargo gliders designed especially for that purpose. Gliders {{such as the}} U.S.-built Waco CG-4 or the British-designed Airspeed Horsa AS.51/58 were towed to their destinations by multi-engine cargo transports — most commonly the C-47 — then released directly overhead of their landing zones. Glider Pilots would execute a steep, rapid descent {{from the moment of}} tow release, arresting their descent rate and airspeed only in the final seconds prior to touchdown. Ingress on-tow into enemy airspace was typically executed at less than 1000 feet above ground level (AGL), often at night and/or in <b>marginal</b> <b>weather,</b> and frequently under severe enemy small-arms and anti-aircraft artillery fire. Wake turbulence generated by the tow-planes' wingtips and propellers coupled with low-level atmospheric turbulence typically resulted in an extremely rough ride, and many of the glider-borne troops suffered airsickness.|$|E
5000|$|Commander Ward {{distinguished}} {{himself in}} action, {{both as an}} inspiring and dynamic commanding officer of 801 Squadron and an outstanding successful Sea Harrier pilot. From the first day HMS Invincible entered the Total Exclusion Zone around the Falkland Islands, the fighting spirit, superb morale and operating efficiency of 801 Squadron was apparent. These standards were maintained during a sustained period of operations without respite. As a pilot Commander Ward flew more than 50 combat sorties by day and night, often in <b>marginal</b> <b>weather</b> conditions setting a splendid example to his Squadron of determination, skill and disregard for personal safety. He personally shot down three Argentine aircraft, a Mirage, a Pucara and a Hercules. The destruction of the Hercules, the only success against this most important target, {{was the result of}} an utterly determined, thoroughly professional piece of teamwork between Commander Ward and his No. 2 which left both aircraft severely extended by lack of fuel on the very long return flight.
