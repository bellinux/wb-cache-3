40|$|Tactile {{roughness}} magnitude estimates {{increase with}} contact force. However, {{it is not}} known whether discrimination thresholds are affected by contact force and other parameters, such as duration and <b>tangential</b> <b>movement.</b> The effects of these factors on roughness discrimination thresholds were determined using an adaptive staircase procedure for coarse and fine texture discrimination during active touch. The presence of <b>tangential</b> <b>movement</b> (dynamic touch) significantly reduced thresholds in coarse and fine texture discrimination compared to static touch, with effects more marked with fine textures. Contact force did not affect discrimination except in static touch of coarse texture when the threshold was significantly higher with low force. Within the perspective that texture discrimination involves distinct vibratory and spatial mechanisms, the results suggest that spatial-dependent texture discrimination deteriorates when contact force is reduced whereas vibration-dependent texture discrimination is unaffected by contact force. Texture discrimination was independent of contact duration in the range 1. 36 s to 3. 46 s, suggesting that tactile integration processes are completed relatively quickly...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} {{general theory of}} {{transport}} barriers for three-dimensional unsteady flows with arbitrary time-dependence. The barriers are obtained as two-dimensional Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCSs) that create locally maximal deformation. Along hyperbolic LCSs, this deformation is induced by locally maximal normal repulsion or attraction. Along shear LCSs, the deformation is created by locally <b>maximal</b> <b>tangential</b> shear.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the extension of}} established Lagrangian mixing measures to make them applicable to data extracted from a 2 -D axisymmetric hurricane simulation. Because of the non-steady and unbounded characteristics of the simulation, the previous measures are extended to a moving frame approach to create time-dependent mixing rates that are dependent upon the initial time of particle integration, and are computed for nonlocal regions. The global measures of mixing derived from finite-time Lyapunov exponents, relative dispersion, and a measured mixing rate are applied to distinct regions representing different characteristic feautures within the model. It is shown that these time-dependent mixing rates exhibit correlations with <b>maximal</b> <b>tangential</b> winds during a quasi-steady state, establishing a connection between mixing and hurricane intensity...|$|R

40|$|In four {{experiments}} involving blindfolded subjects, constant {{errors in}} the haptic judgment of extent in the horizontal plane were found to relate consistently to the time and velocity of limb movement. Radial movements, executed at a slower speed and for a longer time, are judged longer than <b>tangential</b> <b>movements</b> of equal extent. The data {{were considered in relation}} to certain physiological and kinematic properties of the actively moving limb. Taken together with additional information on judgments of movement duration, the results suggest that the illusion of extent is modulated by the perception of differential time cues. In these terms, it was noted that the haptic horizontal-vertical illusion with the L figure is another instance of the interaction of apparent space and time commonly found in studies of psychological relativity. Following Reid's (1954) documentation of the haptic horizontal-vertical illusion with an L figure, recent {{studies have shown that the}} effect is functionally related to the components of radial and <b>tangential</b> exploratory arm <b>movements</b> as described earlier by Davidon and Cheng (1964). Specifically, radial arm movements toward and away from the body, whether along the sagittal or coronal planes, are judged longer than equal <b>tangential</b> <b>movements</b> along the front or side of the body. The effect operates regardless of the spatial separation of the two extents to be judged (Cheng, 1968) and independently of two different types of movement involving different joints and muscle groups (Day & Wong, 1971). As radial movements are specific to the horizontal plane, no relative overestimation of haptic extent is found when the L figure is presented in the vertical (fronto-parallel) Experiments 1, 2, and 3 were completed at the University of Waikato in Hamilton, New Zealand, and supported by New Zealand University Grant...|$|R

It is demonstrated that the proposed design can produce a macroscopically isotropic system with NPR close to the lower bound of − 1. We also developed a 2 D elastic Cosserat continuum model, which represents the microstructure as a regular assembly of rigid particles connected by elastic springs. The comparison of values of NPRs computed using both structural models and the continuum approach shows that the continuum model gives a healthy balance between the simplicity and accuracy {{and can be used}} as a simple tool for design of auxetics...|$|R

We verify on two mesoscale anticyclones, sampled during the EGYPT campaign in 2006, that our methodology provides a correct estimation of the eddy centers and their characteristic radius corresponding to the <b>maximal</b> <b>tangential</b> velocity.

In particular, the bottom-upward development of the cyclonic flow is demonstrated to be a consequence of the secondary circulation. The new analytical model provides a systematic way to construct the three-dimensional storm structures needed for initialization of TC models. An application of the new theory in deriving the pressure-wind relationship is also presented. In Part II, the genesis of Tropical Storm Eugene (2005) is studied, using a cloud-resolving, multiple-grid simulation with the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model. It is shown that the genesis of Eugene {{is a result of the}} merger of two mesovortices associated with the ITCZ breakdowns. The simulation captures well the vortex merger as well as Eugene's life-cycle developments. Some key findings include: 	The merger of mesoscale vortices is critical for the genesis of Eugene; 	The total potential vorticity associated with the merging vortices increases substantially during the merging phase as a result of the net internal dynamical forcing between the PV condensing and diabatic production and partly from the continuous PV fluxes from the ITCZ; and 	Cyclonic vorticity grows from the bottom upward during the merger due to deep convection caused by the low-level frictional convergence and latent heating.

40|$|Bar-induced {{perturbation}} strengths {{are calculated}} for a well defined magnitude limited sample of 180 spiral galaxies, {{based on the}} Ohio State University Bright Galaxy Survey. We use a gravitational torque method, {{the ratio of the}} <b>maximal</b> <b>tangential</b> force to the mean axisymmetric radial force, as a quantitative measure of the bar strength. The gravitational potential is inferred from an H-band light distribution by assuming that the M/L-ratio is constant throughout the disk. Galaxies are deprojected using orientation parameters based on B-band images. In order to eliminate artificial stretching of the bulge, two-dimensional bar-bulge-disk decomposition has been used to derive a reliable bulge model. This bulge model is subtracted from an image, the disk is deprojected assuming it is thin, and then the bulge is added back by assuming that its mass distribution is spherically symmetric. We find that removing the artificial bulge stretch is important especially for galaxies having bars inside large bulges. We also find that the masses of the bulges can be significantly overestimated if bars are not taken into account in the decomposition. Bars are identified using Fourier methods by requiring that the phases of the main modes (m= 2, m= 4) are maintained nearly constant in the bar region. With such methods, bars are found in 65 % of the galaxies in our sample, most of them being classified as SB-type systems in the near-IR by Eskridge and coworkers. We also suggest that as much as≈ 70 % of the galaxies classified as SAB-types in the near-IR might actually be non-barred systems, many of them having central ovals.

The results in this study have confirmed that during water-storage of wood, bacteria selectively attack pit membranes, improving permeability, which leads to enhanced preservative uptake. To optimise conditions for bacterial growth and distribution within wood, the effects of temperature, nutrient supplements, pH and incising/kerfing were investigated during the sprinkling of short Douglas fir bolts in small tanks. For water-sprinkling to be commercially acceptable the treatment time must be as brief as possible. Bacterial access to the wood is an important limiting factor. <b>Tangential</b> <b>movement</b> of bacteria in wood {{was found to be}} more rapid than radial movement and so the effect of incising or kerfing on bacterial access was investigated. Kerfing provided an ideal pathway for tangential entry into wood. Nutrient supplements in the sprinkling solution, particularly nitrogen and phosphate together, enhanced bacterial growth and enzyme activity, reducing the time required to achieve total sapwood preservative penetration. Sprinkling had no effect on heartwood permeability. Sprinkling treatments also influenced the drying characteristics of Douglas fir. Short sprinkling times (1 - 4 weeks) reduced radial and tangential drying rates. Longer sprinkling times improved the rate of drying. Shrinkage measurements were made on small cubes cut from sprinkled wood.

Fraser and Mawson [1] reported that radioactive 86 Rb injected into yellow birch stem in July was detected at 10 feet (ca. 305  cm) high above the injection point within 10  min, and was detected at 15 feet (ca. 457  cm) high within 24  h. Beside the rapid upward movement at the initial stage, they found the upward pathway as a narrow channel of about 1 inch (2.54  cm) in width along the grain. This is consistent with the observations in injection experiments for Japanese cedar in this study and in Aoki et al. [12], in which dark-colored stain up to 2  cm wide in both radial and tangential directions appeared in the center of sapwood region of injected trees. In their Sr injection experiment, Aoki et al.

Since mineral cations in green wood are adsorbed to wood exchange sites [13 – 15], or form complexes [14], injected Rb becomes gradually immobile in sapwood.

An increase in the granule diameter from 0. 3 to 1. 4 µm resulted in a minor (statistically insignificant) decrease in the average rate of the movements. The average rate of saltatory movements of mitochondria was 1. 00 µm/s, and the average track length was 6. 04 µm. Therefore, mitochondria, in contrast to lipid droplets, are rigidly fixed in the cytoplasm, and the force holding mitochondria is equal to the force produced by the microtubule-associated motors. Taking into account the characteristic of the centrifugal saltations, we suggest that they are mediated by an unusual dynein...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{structural}} and geochronological 40 Ar/ 39 Ar study {{was performed in}} kilometre-scale middle and lower crustal lens-shaped domains dominated by a preserved subvertical foliation, surrounded by horizontally foliated migmatites. These domains occur within the Moldanubian nappe overlying the Brunia microcontinent at the eastern margin of the European Variscides. Three main deformation phases were recognized: subvertical S 2 fabric trending NW–SE in lower crustal rocks and NE–SW in mid-crustal rocks. It is reworked by HT/MT horizontal fabric S 3 along margins of crustal domains and in surrounding migmatites. S 3 bears a prolate NE lineation parallel to the S 2 –S 3 intersection in the lower crustal domain. In the middle crustal units, L 3 is weak, connected to oblate strain and trends NE–SW parallel to the S 2 –S 3 intersection. D 4 non-coaxial shear deformation is mainly localized at {{the boundary between the}} Moldanubian nappe and Brunia and bears strong top to the NNE shear criteria. In order to constrain kinematics of the D 3 deformation, strain modelling was performed to show that the Moldanubian hot nappe was frontally thrust over the Brunia indentor. The renewed D 4 <b>tangential</b> <b>movement</b> only heterogeneously reactivates the horizontal S 3. This evolution is recorded in 40 Ar/ 39 Ar amphibole cooling ages, which show two statistically significant Carboniferous peaks at ~ 342 and 332 Ma, which are also reflected by published detrital muscovite 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages in the adjacent foreland basin. This geochronological record is correlated with progressive erosion of the topographically elevated upper crustal part of the Moldanubian nappe during D 3 frontal thrusting, followed by greenschist facies D 4 transpressive reactivation and subsequent erosion of high-grade parts of the nappe...|$|R
40|$|In {{this survey}} we {{describe}} several physically motivated problems {{in which the}} corresponding mathematical models lead to overdetermined elliptic boun-dary-value problems. Such situations appear for instance in fluid mechanics and capillarity theory, theory of elasticity, electrostatics. Our goal here is to give {{an idea of how}} they have been treated mathematically. 1. 1 Interior overdetermined problems. Examples In this section we describe three physical problems which were first given mathematical consideration and solved by Serrin in his classical paper [21]. They lead to overdetermined elliptic boundary-value problems in bounded domains. Fluid moving in a straight pipe. We begin with a simple example which will help us to introduce the kind of problems we consider. Suppose we have a viscous incompressible fluid moving in a straight pipe with a given cross section. Fix rectangular coordinates (x, y, z) in space with the z−axis directed along the pipe. Then the cross section of the pipe containing the origin is a domain in the (x, y) -plane, which we denote by Ω. It is a standard result from fluid mechanics that the flow velocity does not depend on z and therefore can be regarded as a function of x and y, defined in Ω. Furthermore, it is known (see for example [12]) that u satisfies the Poisson equation ∆u = − δ ηl in Ω, (1) where η denotes the dynamic viscosity, l is the length of the pipe and δ is the change of pressure between the two ends of the pipe. 1 The adherence condition {{on the wall of the}} pipe is expressed by the Dirich-let boundary condition u = 0 on ∂Ω. (2) Finally, the tangential stress on the wall is η ∂u ∂n, where n denotes the interior normal to ∂Ω. The precise determination of the point of <b>maximal</b> <b>tangential</b> stress is an important but mathematically very difficult problem. Here we are interested in the following question: when is the tangential stress the same at each point of a cross section of the wall? In other words, can we have a solution of (1) –(2) which satisfies the Neumann type boundary conditio...|$|R
