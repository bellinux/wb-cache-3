This means the previously [...] "dark" [...] chips returning in this game can be used with normal Megaman. However, owners of the Japanese version can still use Dark Chips via the Beast Link Gate accessory, and without the previous penalty of losing 1 Hit Point from their maximum Hit Points. In addition to this, you can link up to a player playing the opposite version of the game you have and compare <b>megachip</b> libraries. the opposite version navi megachips will appear as secret chips and upon obtaining all of the opposite version navi chips you will be awarded with the starred [...] "s" [...] icon on the title screen (note that this isn't necessary to fight your versions sp beast or affect game progress).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an omnidirectional {{spatial and temporal}} 3 -dimensional statistical channel model for 28 GHz dense urban non-line of sight environments. The channel model is developed from 28 GHz ultrawideband propagation measurements obtained with a 400 <b>megachips</b> per second broadband sliding correlator channel sounder and highly directional, steerable horn antennas in New York City. A 3 GPP-like statistical channel model that is easy to implement in software or hardware is developed from measured power delay profiles and a synthesized method for providing absolute propagation delays recovered from 3 -D ray-tracing, as well as measured angle of departure and angle of arrival power spectra. The extracted statistics are used to implement a MATLAB-based statistical simulator that generates 3 -D millimeter-wave temporal and spatial channel coefficients that reproduce realistic impulse responses of measured urban channels. The methods and model presented here {{can be used for}} millimeter-wave system-wide simulations, and air interface design and capacity analyses.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} directional and omnidirectional RMS {{delay spread}} statistics obtained from 28 GHz and 73 GHz ultrawideband propagation measurements {{carried out in}} New York City using a 400 <b>Megachips</b> per second broadband sliding correlator channel sounder and highly directional steerable horn antennas. The 28 GHz measurements did not systematically seek the optimum antenna pointing angles and resulted in 33 % outage for 39 T-R separation distances within 200 m. The 73 GHz measurements systematically found the best antenna pointing angles and resulted in 14. 3 % outage for 35 T-R separation distances within 200 m, all for mobile height receivers. Pointing the antennas to yield the strongest received power is shown to significantly reduce RMS delay spreads in line-of-sight (LOS) environments. A new term, distance extension exponent (DEE) is defined, and used to mathematically describe the increase in coverage distance that results by combining beams from angles with the strongest received power at a given location. These results suggest that employing directionality in millimeter-wave communications systems will reduce inter-symbol interference, improve link margin at cell edges, and enhance overall system performance.

40|$|Abstract—Spread {{spectrum}} (SS) communication {{relies on}} the assumption that some secret is shared beforehand among communicating nodes in order to establish the spreading sequence for long-term wireless communication. Strasser et al. identified this as the circular dependency problem (CDP). This problem is exacerbated in large networks where nodes join and leave the network frequently, and pre-configuration of secrets through physical contact is infeasible. In this work, we introduce an efficient and adversary-resilient secret sharing mechanism based on two novel paradigms (intractable forward-decoding, efficient backward-decoding) called Time Reversed Message Extraction and Key Scheduling (TREKS) that enables SS communication without pre-shared secrets. TREKS is four orders of magnitude faster than previous solutions to the CDP. Furthermore, our approach can be used to operate long-term SS communication without establishing any keys. The energy cost under TREKS is provably optimal with minimal storage overhead, and computation cost at most twice that of traditional SS. We evaluate TREKS through simulation and empirically using an experimental testbed consisting of USRP, GNU Radio, and GPU-equipped nodes. Using TREKS under a modest hardware setup we can sustain a 1 Mbps long-term SS communication spread by a factor of 100 (i. e., 100 <b>Megachips</b> per second) over a 200 MHz bandwidth in real-time...|$|R
40|$|Spread {{spectrum}} (SS) communication {{relies on}} the assumption that some secret is shared before-hand among communicating nodes in order to establish the spreading sequence for long-term wireless communication. Strasser et al. identified the circular dependency problem (CDP) that arises, since a method designed to communicate secret messages requires a pre-shared secret itself [22]. The problem is exacerbated in large networks where nodes join and leave the network frequently, and sharing the secret through physical hand-sake is infeasible. Thus, the secret is shared over the air, making the key establishment susceptible to targeted attacks by adversaries. In this work, we introduce Time Reversed Message Extraction and Key Scheduling (TREKS) to enable SS communication without requiring such pre-shared secrets. Based on two novel techniques we call intractable forward decoding and efficient backward decoding, TREKS is able to outperform previous solutions to the CDP [22, 21, 15] by four orders of magnitude. Our approach can not only be used for the initial round of exchange to carry the challenge of an authentication and key establishment protocol, but also for long-term communication without establishing keys. The energy cost under TREKS is provably optimal with very small storage and computation overhead, and its message decoding cost is at most twice as under traditional SS. We evaluate TREKS through simulation and real-world experimentation with USRP, GNURadio, and GPU-equipped nodes. With TREKS, using a modest setup can sustain a 1 Mbps long-term communication spreading by a factor of 100 (i. e., 100 <b>Megachips</b> per sec) over a 200 MHz bandwidth. ...|$|R
