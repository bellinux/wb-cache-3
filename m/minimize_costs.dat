The critical difference between the Truman and Eisenhower policies of containment had to do with Eisenhower's concerns that the United States could not indefinitely afford great military spending.

He established the nearby Chester Pipe and Tube Company, from which he could source the large amount of iron piping and quality boiler tubes required for his ships. With the purchase of a patent for an asbestos compound, he founded the Chalmers-Spence Company to provide pipe insulation. He also secured exclusive patent rights in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and Delaware for the Hirsch propeller, a European design which lessened vibration, and he founded the Hirsch Propeller Company to manufacture it. The end result of these efforts was a network of companies that made the Roach shipyard largely independent of third-party suppliers, enabling Roach to <b>minimize</b> <b>costs</b> and undercut his competitors.|$|E

25|$|Linear {{programming}} {{is a widely}} used field of optimization for several reasons. Many practical problems in operations research can be expressed as linear programming problems. Certain special cases of linear programming, such as network flow problems and multicommodity flow problems are considered important enough to have generated much research on specialized algorithms for their solution. A number of algorithms for other types of optimization problems work by solving LP problems as sub-problems. Historically, ideas from linear programming have inspired many of the central concepts of optimization theory, such as duality, decomposition, {{and the importance of}} convexity and its generalizations. Likewise, linear {{programming is}} heavily used in microeconomics and company management, such as planning, production, transportation, technology and other issues. Although the modern management issues are ever-changing, most companies would like to maximize profits or <b>minimize</b> <b>costs</b> with limited resources. Therefore, many issues can be characterized as linear programming problems.|$|E

2500|$|The company built {{a company}} town, Pullman, Illinois on , [...] south of Chicago in 1880. Pullman {{contracted}} Solon Spenser Beman and Nathan F. Barrett {{to design and}} landscape the entire company town respectively. Both Beman and Barrett were experts in their respective fields. Beman interned under the famous architect Richard Upjohn and Barrett landscaped areas in Staten Island and Tuxedo, New York, as well as Long Branch, New Jersey. The community was designed by Solon Spencer Beman and landscaped by Nathan Barrett. According to George Pullman's governing conception, it was not within the city limits of Chicago but in the adjoining town of Hyde Park. On April 24, 1880, groundwork began on the company town. Throughout {{the construction of the}} company town Pullman strove to <b>minimize</b> <b>costs</b> and maximize construction efficiency. Whenever and wherever possible Pullman adopted techniques of mass production. The first departments and shops constructed were ones such as painting, iron, and woodworking, which could be used in the continuing construction of the company town. By January 1, 1881, the company town was ready for its first resident to move in. A foreman from the Pullman Company’s Detroit shop, Lee Benson, moved his wife, child, and sister into the company town. On the exterior, the buildings of the company town were made of red brick with limestone trim. On the interior, the buildings had high ceilings and large windows. The walls of the interior of the buildings were also purposefully painted in light colors to provide the semblance of a cheerful environment. By the time construction was finished on the company town it was composed of a library, theater, hotel, church, market, sewage farm, park, and residential buildings. The bar in the Florence Hotel was the only place where alcohol could be served and consumed in the company town. In the residential section of the town, there was 150 acres dedicated to tenements, flats and single-family homes that rented from $0.50 to $0.75 a month. The residences featured modern conveniences such as gas, water, indoor sewage plumbing and regular garbage removal. By 1884, the town included more than 1,400 tenements and flats, and by July of the following year, its population was over 8,600.|$|E
