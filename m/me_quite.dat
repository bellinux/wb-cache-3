He sent Escher {{a copy of the}} paper; Escher recorded that Coxeter's figure of a hyperbolic tessellation [...] "gave <b>me</b> <b>quite</b> a shock": the infinite regular repetition of the tiles in the hyperbolic plane, growing rapidly smaller towards the edge of the circle, was precisely what he wanted to allow him to represent infinity on a two-dimensional plane.|$|E

500|$|Sportswriters {{and fans}} have {{frequently}} called for Henderson to be {{inducted into the}} Hockey Hall of Fame on the strength of his performance. [...] Commentator and former NHL coach Don Cherry argued that Henderson's status as hero of the [...] "greatest series in hockey history" [...] was enough to qualify him. [...] Henderson himself does not believe he belongs: [...] "So many Canadians get upset that I’m not in the Hall of Fame, and I tell them all the time if I was on the committee, I wouldn’t vote for <b>me.</b> <b>Quite</b> frankly, I didn’t have a Hall of Fame career." [...] Henderson has been honoured by Canada's Sports Hall of Fame on two occasions: he was first inducted as an individual in 1995, and again ten years later along with his 1972 teammates. The Summit Series team has also been honoured with a star on Canada's Walk of Fame. Henderson has been inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame (1997), the IIHF Hall of Fame (2013) and has been honoured by Hockey Canada with the Order of Hockey in Canada as part of its 2013 class. He was named a Member of the Order of Canada in December 2012 in recognition of [...] "his engagement in support of a range of social and charitable causes" [...] along with his achievements on the ice. In 2014, he was named to the Order of Ontario.|$|E

2500|$|The {{research}} of several film scholars on Hitchcock's production of Psycho validates {{the claim that}} Bass {{in his capacity as}} a graphic artist did indeed have a significant influence on the visual design and pacing of that famous scene. Hitchcock had asked Bass to design and produce storyboards for the shower murder scene and for some other scenes in the film. For this, Bass received a credit as Pictorial Consultant as well as Title Designer. Janet Leigh told Donald Spoto that “the planning of the shower scene was left up to Saul Bass, and Hitchcock followed his storyboard precisely. Because of this [...] [...] [...] [...] went very professionally,” and she told Stephen Rebello that “Mr. Hitchcock showed Saul Bass’s storyboards to <b>me</b> <b>quite</b> proudly, telling me in exact detail {{how he was going to}} shoot the scene from Saul’s plans”.|$|E
2500|$|His {{appointment}} attracted {{controversy in}} some quarters and it was reputed that the other judges of the court were against his appointment.

Serle states that each of the judges of the court denied making any such statements. [...] He had general support with most newspapers and from the legal profession. [...] Nevertheless, he decided on 19 November 1886 to resign the position before actually taking the oath of office. [...] He was therefore gazetted as chief justice for only six days, having resigned twelve days after being offered the position.|$|E

When Vang asked if something was wrong, other people told Vang that if Eastwood did not make a comment, then his performance was satisfactory. Vang added that Eastwood encouraged ad-libbing with the Hmong actors. Ahney Her said that she liked the improvisation work, even when she was required to translate between the English and Hmong languages. When asked if the in-character racial slurs offended the actors in real life, Ahney said that she did not feel offense. Vang said [...] "I was called so many names that I can’t say here because of how vulgar they were. It disturbed <b>me</b> <b>quite</b> a lot, but at the end of the day it was just a script." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late July Darwin read Wilberforce's {{review in}} the Quarterly. It used a 60-year-old parody from the Anti-Jacobin of the prose of Darwin's {{grandfather}} Erasmus, implying old revolutionary sympathies. It argued that if [...] "transmutations were actually occurring" [...] this would be seen in rapidly reproducing invertebrates, and since it isn't, why think that [...] "the favourite varieties of turnips are tending to become men". Darwin pencilled [...] "rubbish" [...] in the margin. To the statement about classification that [...] "all creation is the transcript in matter of ideas eternally existing {{in the mind of}} the Most High!!", Darwin scribbled [...] "mere words". At the same time, Darwin was willing to grant that Wilberforce's review was clever: he wrote to Hooker that [...] "it picks out with skill all the most conjectural parts, and brings forward well all the difficulties. It quizzes <b>me</b> <b>quite</b> splendidly by quoting the 'Anti-Jacobin' against my Grandfather." ...|$|E

[...] He reportedly began composing the song at his sister's house in the Englewood section of Chicago and continued the effort on the return train ride from Chicago to Ann Arbor. [...] Elbel's lyric, [...] "Champions of the West," [...] refers to Michigan's having won the Western Conference championship {{for the first time in}} the school's history. [...] Elbel later recalled:"We were crazed with joy. [...] We paraded in the dark. We yelled and followed our U-M Band, singing to the tune of 'Hot Time in the Old Town.' It struck <b>me</b> <b>quite</b> suddenly that such an epic should be dignified by something more elevating, for this was not ordinary victory. [...] My spirits were so uplifted that I was clear off the earth, and that is when 'The Victors' was inspired. I put in a lot of 'hails' and I knew the fellows would get them in with the proper emphasis. Through them, the title suggested itself, and I dedicated it to the Michigan team of 1898." ...|$|E
