This research describes {{the similarities and differences}} of adverb “totemo” and “sangat” in term of structure. Contrastive analysis provides a mean to compare and find the similarities and differences between two languages. From this research authors conludes the similarities and differences from both adverbs. The similarities of adverb “totemo” and “sangat” are: 1. 	Both of the adverb are use to express something that is “very” or “extremely” something. Beside that, Japanese adverb “totemo” and Indonesian adverb “sangat” included on the same section in adverb, which is adverb degree. 2. 	Adverb “totemo” and “sangat” always placed in the middle of sentence and modified adjectives, verbs, and another adverbs. 3. 	If adverb “totemo” and “sangat” omitted from sentence, it will change the information of the sentence. The differences of adverb “totemo” and “sangat” are: 1. 	When “totemo” is used to modify Japanese ngative, it indicates a feeling of “hard” or “cannot possibly”. 2.

40|$|To {{measure the}} {{reliability}} of recognized words in an ASR, we propose a generalized word posterior probability (GWPP) as the sole confidence measure. This measure is computed efficiently via a word graph with the forwardbackward algorithm or directly with the generalized string likelihoods of N-best strings from the recognizer. The GWPP is a <b>modified</b> <b>word</b> posterior probability where a word event, given all the acoustic observations of an utterance, is measured as a conditional probability. Time registration of the starting and ending frames of a hypothesized word is relaxed, similar to the Baum-Welch model training algorithm, and acoustic and language model weights are optimally adjusted to accommodate instrumental but inaccurate modeling assumptions used in implementing those two models. When tested on the ATR Japanese BTEC speech database, the confidence error rates are significantly reduced as much as 25 % at various operating points. ...|$|E

40|$|Generally {{a content}} based spam filter works on {{words and phrases}} of email text and if it finds {{offensive}} content it gives that email a numerical value (depending on the content).

40|$|This paper proposes the {{incremental}} dependency parsing method {{based on the}} context-free grammar with dependency information. In the proposed method, the reachability, which represents the relation between catego-ries, is used. In parallel to the inputting of sentence, the dependency, which is {{the relation between the}} modifying word and the <b>modified</b> <b>word,</b> is computed. In the proposed method, the parse tree to cover the inputted fragment of the sentence is not needed. Consequently, the method can com-pute the dependency more efficiently than the method that computes the dependency from the parse tree. As a result of a parsing experiment using ATIS corpus, the proposed method utilizing the reachability is demonstrated to be effective in reducing the parsing time. © 2005 Wiley Peri-odicals, Inc.

40|$|Generalized word {{posterior}} probability (GWPP), a confidence measure for verifying recognized words, needs to equalize and weight acoustic and language model likelihood contributions to minimize verification errors. In this study, we investigate the word verification error surface {{and use it}} to optimize these weights and the corresponding verification threshold in a development set. We test three different search algorithms for finding the optimal parameters, including: a full grid search, a gradient-based steepest descent search, and a downhill simplex search. The three search methods yield very similar solutions. Proper acoustic and language model weights, especially the ratio between them, changes with the relative importance (reliability) between the two knowledge sources. For a narrow beam width, the role of the acoustic model is less critical than language model in GWPP-based word verification, which is due to the noisy acoustic information maintained in a narrow beam. Using a large vocabulary continuous Japanese speech database (Basic Travel Expression Corpus), the largest relative improvement obtained is 33. 2 % for confidence error rate and 38. 7 % for a <b>modified</b> <b>word</b> accuracy. 1...|$|E
