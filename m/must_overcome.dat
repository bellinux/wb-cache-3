5|$|Ski wax {{enhances the}} ability of a ski or other runner to slide over snow, which depends on both the {{properties}} of the snow and the ski to result in an optimum amount of lubrication from melting the snow by friction with the ski—too little and the ski interacts with solid snow crystals, too much and capillary attraction of meltwater retards the ski. Before a ski can slide, it <b>must</b> <b>overcome</b> the maximum value static friction. Kinetic (or dynamic) friction occurs when the ski is moving over the snow.|$|E
5|$|Using {{his various}} natural {{abilities}} and occasionally items or power-ups, Kirby <b>must</b> <b>overcome</b> obstacles while heading towards a goal door {{at end of}} the level, where he must fight a boss to obtain one of the Sparkling Stars. Most bosses are fought by sucking up the projectiles they create and spitting them back at the boss, however, the boss of the third level briefly turns the game into a Shoot 'em up. The last level before the final boss consists of a boss rush, where the player must fight all of the game's bosses again going through a short area based on the boss's home level.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, Bana {{was invited}} to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Lucky You, a romantic comedy on which Bana worked before filming Munich, was {{released}} in early 2007. In the film, he played Huck Cheever, a professional poker player who <b>must</b> <b>overcome</b> his personal problems to win a high-stakes tournament in Las Vegas.

In 2007, he also returned to his Australian TV roots by appearing in hit comedy Kath & Kim as himself.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{have argued}} that {{cognitive}} flexibility is also a component of multiple classification, as originally described by psychologist Jean Piaget. In multiple classification tasks, participants (primarily children, who have already developed or {{are in the process}} of developing this skill) must classify objects in several different ways at once - thereby thinking flexibly about them. Similarly, in order to be cognitively flexible they <b>must</b> <b>overcome</b> centration, which is the tendency for young children to solely focus on one aspect of an object or situation. For example, when children are young they may be solely able to focus on one aspect of an object (i.e. color of object), and be unable to focus on both aspects (i.e. both color and kind of object). Thus, research suggests if an individual is centrated in their thinking, then they will be more cognitively inflexible.|$|E

Marika is revealed to be the genetic copy of a deceased Marika Ukita despite a standing ban on human cloning. Fuchuya suffers from red-green color blindness after his eyes are exposed to an exploding firework at close range in a childhood accident. Unknown to the group, Shu suffers from hereditary hemoptysis (coughing up of blood) and dies from the condition soon after his selection as an exchange student to the American space program. This tragedy reveals Kei's feelings for him, which she keeps hidden for much of the series.|$|E
5|$|Wild Arms is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} {{that involves the}} player controlling up to three characters, Rudy, Jack, and Cecilia, as they progress {{through a number of}} environments, battle enemies, and solve puzzles. The game is presented in a top-down two-dimensional fashion where the player has an overhead view of all the action taking place on a particular screen. To advance, the player <b>must</b> <b>overcome</b> a number of story-based scenarios and sequences that involve navigating through dungeons while fighting enemies that appear randomly. Characters progress and grow by gaining experience points after a battle, discovering crest graphs, finding ARMs, and mastering sword techniques prompted by various events in the game.

25|$|Plasma clouds lose energy through {{conduction}} and radiation. Conduction {{occurs when}} ions, electrons or neutrals impact other substances, typically a {{surface of the}} device, and transfer {{a portion of their}} kinetic energy to the other atoms. Radiation is energy that leaves the cloud as light in the visible, UV, IR, or X-ray spectra. Radiation increases with temperature. Fusion power technologies <b>must</b> <b>overcome</b> these losses.|$|E
25|$|Radar systems <b>must</b> <b>overcome</b> {{unwanted}} {{signals in}} order {{to focus on the}} targets of interest. These unwanted signals may originate from internal and external sources, both passive and active. The ability of the radar system to overcome these unwanted signals defines its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). SNR is defined as the ratio of the signal power to the noise power within the desired signal; it compares the level of a desired target signal to the level of background noise (atmospheric noise and noise generated within the receiver). The higher a system's SNR the better it is at discriminating actual targets from noise signals.|$|E
