5|$|A {{section of}} the A303 around Weyhill, west of Andover, runs {{alongside}} a ditch thought to be constructed during the Bronze Age. Several historic roads converged at Weyhill, which {{is believed to have}} hosted a popular market since the Middle Ages, eventually becoming one of the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> England by the 19th century. The market closed in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|After the {{purchase}} of the original site in 1919, {{the purchase}} of Gilwellbury and adjoining land in 1945 is probably the next <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> Gilwell Park's Scouting history because it allowed The Scout Association to close the original road and fully utilize Branchet Field. It was originally used for small retreats and conferences but is now used as staff accommodation. The Ministry of Education assisted in the purchase.|$|E

5|$|The Baroque art was {{developing}} {{to a great}} extent under the patronage of the Catholic Church, which utilized the art to facilitate religious influence, allocating for this purpose the very substantial financial resources at its disposal. The <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> this context art form was architecture, with features rather austere at first, accompanied in due time by progressively more elaborate and lavish facade and interior design concepts.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{are used}} {{for a variety of}} {{applications}} in industry, but their main use is as additives to animal feed. This is necessary, since many of the bulk components of these feeds, such as soybeans, either have low levels or lack some of the essential amino acids: lysine, methionine, threonine, and tryptophan are <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> the production of these feeds. In this industry, amino acids are also used to chelate metal cations in order to improve the absorption of minerals from supplements, which may be required to improve the health or production of these animals.|$|E

Until that time, players had been forced to accept whatever NHL management paid in salaries. It was the start of the player's agent era in professional hockey. For Eagleson, it was the start of his sports business empire.

5|$|Between 1577 and 1583, various colonial {{writers have}} {{reported}} in their chronicles {{the use of}} tunjos for offering pieces. The descriptions from the early colonial period of the New Kingdom of Granada have been collected first by Vicenta Cortés Alonso in 1958 and later by Ulises Rojas in 1965. The reports of the late 16th century show that the religious practices of the Muisca were still alive, despite the intensive catholic conversion policies. Caciques of Tuta, Toca, Duitama, Iguaque, Ramiriquí, Chitagoto, Onzaga, Tunja and Cucunubá participated in these rituals. The religious leader of Sogamoso was still the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> these days.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage {{in large}} {{bodies of water}} differs {{markedly}} from camouflage on land. The environment {{is essentially the same}} on all sides. Light always falls from above, and there is generally no variable background to compare with trees and bushes. Three main camouflage methods predominate in water: transparency, reflection, and counter-illumination. Transparency and reflectivity are <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> the top 100 metres of the ocean; counter-illumination is the main method from 100 metres down to 1000 metres; while camouflage becomes less important in the dark waters below 1000 metres.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{his years}} in the Philippines, Taft was keenly {{interested}} as president in East Asian affairs. Taft considered relations with Europe relatively unimportant, {{but because of the}} potential for trade and investment, Taft ranked the post of minister to China as <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> the Foreign Service. Knox did not agree, and declined a suggestion that he go to Peking to view the facts on the ground. Taft considered Roosevelt's minister there, William W. Rockhill, as uninterested in the China trade, and replaced him with William J. Calhoun, whom McKinley and Roosevelt had sent on several foreign missions. Knox did not listen to Calhoun on policy, and there were often conflicts. Taft and Knox tried unsuccessfully to extend John Hay's Open Door Policy to Manchuria.|$|E
5|$|He was disheartened {{with what}} he saw in Pernambuco, a {{province}} {{far away from the}} imperial capital, but one of the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> the country. Local political bosses were aligned with the Party of Order or the Liberal Party, but these were mostly nominal affiliations. Local oligarchs had vied among themselves for centuries over power. To them, political principles, such as those preached by the national leaders of the Party of Order, meant little or nothing. Their political ambitions focused on patronage and the annihilation of their local rivals. Honório Hermeto found himself embroiled in an ongoing power struggle between the aristocratic planters, who sought to exercise control over provincial affairs.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} after World War I, Britain {{expanded}} Singapore Naval Base at Sembawang on Singapore's north coast {{as part of}} plans to deter Japanese expansionism in the region (the Singapore strategy). The resulting facility was among the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> the British Empire and included the large King GeorgeVI graving dock and AdmiraltyIX floating dry dock. The Commonwealth forces allocated to Malaya and Singapore were swiftly defeated {{in the months after}} the outbreak of the Pacific War, however, and the island was surrendered to the Japanese on 15February 1942. Singapore was bombed by Japanese aircraft {{on a number of occasions}} during the Battle of Malaya and subsequent fighting on the island itself; these raids caused many civilian deaths.|$|E

5|$|Nutria were {{introduced}} into coastal marshes from South America in the mid-1900s, and their population has since exploded into the millions. They cause serious damage to coastal marshes and may dig burrows in levees. Hence, Louisiana {{has had a}} bounty to try to reduce nutria numbers. Large American alligators, however, feed heavily on nutria, so American alligators may not only control nutria populations in Louisiana, but also prevent them spreading east into the Everglades. Since hunting and trapping preferentially take the large American alligators that are the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> eating nutria, some changes in harvesting {{may be needed to}} capitalize on their ability to control nutria.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Grunwald is {{regarded}} as one of the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> the histories of Poland and Lithuania. In the history of Ukraine, the battle is better associated with Vytautas the Great, who stood as the leader of Eastern Orthodox Christianity at that time. In Lithuania the victory is synonymous with the Grand Duchy's political and military peak. It was a source of national pride during the age of Romantic nationalism and inspired resistance to the Germanization and Russification policies of the German and Russian Empires. The Knights were portrayed as bloodthirsty invaders and Grunwald as a just victory achieved by a small, oppressed nation.|$|E

5|$|The {{ability of}} {{bacteria}} to degrade {{a variety of}} organic compounds is remarkable and {{has been used in}} waste processing and bioremediation. Bacteria capable of digesting the hydrocarbons in petroleum are often used to clean up oil spills. Fertiliser was added to some of the beaches in Prince William Sound in an attempt to promote the growth of these naturally occurring bacteria after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. These efforts were effective on beaches that were not too thickly covered in oil. Bacteria are also used for the bioremediation of industrial toxic wastes. In the chemical industry, bacteria are <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> the production of enantiomerically pure chemicals for use as pharmaceuticals or agrichemicals.|$|E

Transparency and reflectivity are <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> the top 100 metres of the ocean; counterillumination is {{the main}} method from 100 metres down to 1000 metres; while camouflage becomes less important in the dark waters below 1000 metres. Most animals of the open sea use {{at least one of}} these methods to camouflage themselves. Camouflage in relatively shallow waters is more like terrestrial camouflage, where additional methods are used by animals in many different groups. These methods of camouflage are described in turn below.|$|E
5|$|By {{becoming}} chef de canton, Houphouët assumed {{responsibility for}} the administration of Akouè, a canton which comprised 36 villages. He also {{took charge of the}} family plantation—at the time one of the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> the country—and worked to diversify its rubber, cocoa and coffee crops. He soon became one of Africa's richest farmers. On 3 September 1944, he established, in cooperation with the colonial administration, the African Agricultural Union (Syndicat agricole africain, SAA). Under his presidency, the SAA brought together African farmers who were dissatisfied with their working conditions and worked to protect their interests against those of European planters. Anti-colonialist and anti-racist, the organisation demanded better working conditions, higher wages, and the abolition of unfree labor. The union quickly received the support of nearly 20,000 plantation workers, together with that of the left-wing French administrators placed in office by the Provisional Government. Its success irritated colonists {{to the extent that they}} took legal action against Houphouët, accusing him of being anti-French for never seeking French citizenship. However, Houphouët befriended the Inspector Minister of the Colonies, who ordered the charges dropped. They were more successful in obtaining the replacement of the sympathetic Governor André Latrille with the hostile Governor Henry de Mauduit.|$|E
