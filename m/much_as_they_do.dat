5|$|Georgian English {{landscape}} gardens, such as West Wycombe and Stowe, {{are arranged}} as a walk or series of walks {{that take the}} visitor through a range of locations, {{each with its own}} specific character and separate from the last. Planting and the shape of the landscape is used, alongside follies and man-made water features, to create pleasant vistas and set pieces centred on a building, straight avenue, serpentine walk, or viewpoint. In the later years of the 18th century, the 5,000acres (20km²) of grounds were extended to the east, towards the nearby town of High Wycombe, and Humphrey Repton completed the creation of the gardens, until they appeared <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> today.|$|E

25|$|Application {{services}} are offered through a single program known officially as the Cooperative Macintosh Toolbox environment, but are universally {{referred to as}} the Blue Box. The Blue Box encapsulates an existing System 7 operating system inside a single process and address space. Mac programs run inside the Blue Box <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> under System 7, as cooperative tasks that use the non-reentrant Toolbox calls. A worst-case scenario is that an application in the Blue Box crashes, taking down the entire Blue Box instance with it. This does not result in the system as a whole going down, however, and the Blue Box can be restarted.|$|E

25|$|The {{separation}} between {{stars in a}} binary may range from less than one astronomical unit (AU, the average Earth–Sun distance) to several hundred. In latter instances, the gravitational effects will be negligible on a planet orbiting an otherwise suitable star and habitability potential will not be disrupted unless the orbit is highly eccentric (see Nemesis, for example). However, where the separation is significantly less, a stable orbit may be impossible. If a planet's distance to its primary exceeds about one fifth of the closest approach of the other star, orbital stability is not guaranteed. Whether planets might form in binaries at all had long been unclear, given that gravitational forces might interfere with planet formation. Theoretical work by Alan Boss at the Carnegie Institution has shown that gas giants can form around stars in binary systems <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> around solitary stars.|$|E
500|$|The album {{begins with}} a number of up-tempo songs before {{expanding}} to a variety of tempos for its second half. Vedder attributed the faster and more aggressive songs to the band writing a lot of material that kept getting pared down, with the band leaving behind mid-tempo songs, while Ament suggested that {{it was because of the}} band balancing recording and touring which resulted in [...] "physicality... from being out on the road." [...] The band attempted to create an environment in which McCready and drummer Matt Cameron could play <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> live. Ament said that there was [...] "a lot of honing of the guitars and vocals in the middle and toward the end," [...] which resulted in the album sounding [...] "more polished." [...] On the overall feeling of the album, Ament said, [...] "The band playing in a room—that came across. There's a kind of immediacy to the record, and that's what we were going for." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1998, Chris Nelson of MTV News wrote, [...] ""Dammit"'s staccato {{rhythm and}} melancholy pop-spirit call to mind Chicago punks Screeching Weasel as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> the {{emotional}} fretting of the Descendents." [...] Scott Heisel of Alternative Press called [...] "Dammit" [...] the [...] "perfect punk song, everyone knows it, and it's probably being covered in someone's basement right now." [...] Consequence of Sound, in a 2015 top 10 of Blink-182's best songs, ranked [...] "Dammit" [...] at number one, commenting, [...] "The best songwriters don't capture what you're going through individually {{in your life}} – they capture {{the things that are}} common to all humanity, and there's something about [...] "Dammit"'s chorus, something about its opening C, D, E riff that sounds universal." [...] Complex in 2012 examined the song through the lens of its inclusion in Can't Hardly Wait (1998), calling it, [...] "one of the most iconic songs of the 90s – those three, unmistakable guitar chords, the two voices trading in verse (one sneering punk, the other, a throaty few octaves lower), and a soaring punk chorus." [...] At Billboard, it is described as a [...] "jump-around pop punk song".|$|E

500|$|The band {{took the}} {{approach}} of recording one song at a time, and agreed with O'Brien to mix the songs as each one was finished. O'Brien had the band members set up <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> live, {{and most of the}} songs were developed out of jam sessions. Guitarist Stone Gossard said, [...] "I think we allowed things to develop in a more natural, band-oriented sort of way, rather than me bringing in a bunch of stuff that was already arranged." [...] Gossard added that most of the songs were arranged once Vedder joined in and started singing, elaborating, [...] "You could tell when the music wanted to change just by the way he was singing." [...] In a 2009 interview, Gossard stated, [...] " [...] was probably where it felt better recording wise. I saw how it could change and evolve which gave me a lot of inspiration to go we can do ballads, we can do fast stuff, we can do slow stuff, we can do punk stuff. That was where I realized there were gonna be a lot of places to go with Ed." ...|$|E
500|$|The stories {{themselves}} were designed as glimpses into the Halo universe, including {{information on the}} inner workings of the alien Covenant, as well as details regarding elements of the back-story that were hitherto undisclosed. Jarrard explained that [...] "The stories that happen off camera, the parallel events to the arcs that our fans know from the existing mediums, are the stories we really wanted to tell." [...] Jarrard further described this as an attempt to move away from the story of the Master Chief, the central character of the franchise, and focus instead on what they believed to be the core themes that lay behind the game universe, such as maintaining hope in the face of overwhelming odds and humanity's struggle for survival; themes that extended beyond [...] "...a genetically enhanced super soldier picking up two guns and kicking some alien butt." [...] The four stories that ended up in the final publication were [...] "the most interesting to , and the writers of [...] ". Although Bungie created the story arcs present in the Halo Graphic Novel, the studio described the importance of providing a framework for each story that the various artists and writers could tell without jeopardizing their own voice. Artist Simon Bisley said that [...] "the stress was to make the characters look very <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> in the game. Beyond that point I was given free rein to interpret the script and the action" [...] based on what was given to the artists and writers.|$|E

50|$|The {{decline in}} New Castle's economy had the {{long-range}} fortunate effect of preventing most residents from making any significant structural changes to their homes.

2500|$|Plato’s Problem was {{expressed}} generally by Bertrand Russell: [...] "How comes it that human beings, whose {{contacts with the}} world are brief and personal and limited, are nevertheless able to know as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> know?" [...] The problem arises {{in the domain of}} language acquisition in that children attain infinitely more than they experience. Literally so, we shall see: they attain a productive system, a grammar, on the basis of very little experience. So there is more, much more, to language acquisition than mimicking what we hear in childhood, and there is more to it than the simple transmission of a set of words and sentences from one generation of speakers to the next. There is more to it than a reproduction of experience and, in maturity, our capacity goes well beyond what we have experienced.|$|E
2500|$|According to New York Times author Felicia R. Lee, the {{siblings}} act [...] "chatty, guileless, fun-loving," [...] <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> in their genuine lives. She also notes that, of the show's characters, [...] "no one over 18 has much sense." [...] Draper's role as creator—the developer {{of the original}} characters—allowed her to contemplate her boys' fictional birth mother as deceased; her name is never revealed. However, in the show, the boys' father is infatuated with an estranged lady named Betty. Moreover, although portraying fictional characters, the ensemble castincluding Qaasim Middleton as well as real life friends David Levi, Thomas Batuello, and Cooper Pillotkeep their full names on-screen. Nonetheless, Allie DiMeco plays Rosalina; {{the siblings}}' cousin Jesse Draper portrays the group's puzzled nanny named Jesse Cook; and the boys' father Michael Wolff plays the siblings' father, Sonny, the latter whom Draper notes she wrote {{similar to that of}} a child.|$|E
2500|$|David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle gave a {{positive}} review and welcomed Barr back to television. [...] He said, [...] "She's foulmouthed, abrasive and suffers absolutely nothing gladly. Yet, as always, her own foibles crack her up as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> her boyfriend or visiting eldest son. The fact that she's completely unafraid to hold {{herself up to}} ridicule endears her to her audience". [...] He also noted that a reality show format [...] "probably fits Barr better than, say, another sitcom [...] ". He ended his review saying, [...] "The wild pigs {{might not want to}} stick around, but the rest of us should be willing to give Roseanne's Nuts a shot for a few episodes, at least. [...] Scott D. Pierce of The Salt Lake Tribune said in his review, [...] "As reality shows go, Roseanne's Nuts is pretty mild. Oh, she's bleeped a lot. And there's some blurring of nudity. (Ick.) But mostly it's just Roseanne being Roseanne on a macadamia nut farm".|$|E
