5|$|So far {{during this}} period, Leeds has seen much development, {{particularly}} in the city centre, most notably the highrise developments such as Bridgewater Place, the developments around Clarence Dock, K2 (albeit a conversion from an older building) {{as well as many}} developments incorporating student accommodation. The 2002 redevelopment of Leeds railway station incorporated a notable steel and glass roof covering the <b>main</b> <b>platform</b> hall and providing panoramic views to the south west from the mezzanine level.|$|E

5|$|The first {{traces of}} human {{activity}} at the site date to approximately 800 BC, with the first structures being built about 350 BC. Around 250 AD the complex underwent a major redevelopment {{with the construction of}} a massive basal platform that supported a cluster of temples; this was followed around AD 450 by the addition of a row of four pyramids on a terrace to the south of the <b>main</b> <b>platform.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the Soviet Union {{originated}} Project 1144 Orlan, {{a project}} intended {{to design and}} build a large, nuclear powered anti-submarine vessel. At the time, the Soviets did not envisage that arming surface ships with anti-ship missiles was required, as then current doctrine had it that submarines were the <b>main</b> <b>platform</b> for attacking enemy shipping. However, {{the sinking of the}} Israeli destroyer INS Eilat in 1967 by anti-ship missiles fired from an Egyptian missile boat led to a re-think of the use of surface ships in the role. The threat of US Navy surface ships, which were increasingly capable of a range of different missions, led {{to the idea of a}} single ship combining anti-aircraft, anti-ship and anti-submarine capabilities crystalising.|$|E

A frieze of Royal Doulton porcelain runs around the balcony above it {{from which the}} floor's design, featuring a locomotive and related symbols, can be clearly seen. The <b>main</b> <b>platform</b> is the country's longest, extending for about 500 metres.|$|E
25|$|The station {{used to have}} dock {{platforms}} at {{both the}} north and south ends and a crossover midway along the <b>main</b> <b>platform.</b> Large shunting yards, most of which have now gone, occupied land to the south. Much of this land has now been subdivided into wholesale and light industrial properties.|$|E
25|$|Alongside the <b>main</b> <b>platform,</b> at the Paignton end, {{a modern}} {{workshop}} {{stands on the}} site of the platform once used by Brixham trains; this is used for carriage repairs. On the same side, beyond the modern bridge carrying the road to Brixham, are some sidings and the turntable. Opposite the carriage workshop, behind the Paignton platform, is another workshop which is used for heavy repairs to locomotives.|$|E

25|$|The train shed {{was removed}} in 1912-13 and the {{platforms}} extended northwards towards the level crossing. A second island platform was provided {{on the west}} side and this entailed the goods sheds being narrowed from two tracks to one at their southern end. The middle island platform was mainly used for LSWR trains while down GWR services used the original <b>main</b> <b>platform</b> and the new island platforms. Before Southern Region services to Plymouth were abandoned, passengers could see Plymouth-bound services of the Western Region and Southern Region leaving St Davids in opposite directions. The station has remained largely in this form since, but resignalling in the 1985 saw the ex-LSWR services moved to the <b>main</b> <b>platform</b> so that down ex-GWR line services did not have to cross their path {{at the south end of}} the station. A through line between platforms 1 and 3 was removed at the same time. The new signal box was built on the site of the old atmospheric engine house and replaced three older signal boxes.|$|E
25|$|By 1927 {{the station}} {{included}} a goods shed to the south-east of the <b>main</b> <b>platform,</b> and a turntable at the north-west {{end of the}} station. The current turntable is apparently smaller than the original, which was relocated to Port Douglas. Elements that were present in 1932 which no longer exist include a motor shed by the turntable, and signalman's, ganger's and waitresses' quarters {{to the south of}} the station near Arara Street.|$|E
25|$|The middle pair of {{platforms}} is numbered 3 & 4. The {{former is}} used by similar trains to platform 1, but platforms 4-6 {{do not have access}} to the lines from Exeter Central. Instead platform 4 is the <b>main</b> <b>platform</b> for inter-city trains to Paignton, Plymouth and Penzance. Trains from both platforms 1 and 3 can also reach this route so trains from Exmouth that continue westwards will reverse in one of these platforms.|$|E

25|$|The facade {{is framed}} in stonework, with gates of wrought iron and portico with arch. The upper floors include {{rectangular}} windows, {{with the first}} and second floors including wrought iron varandas and the third floor with smaller picture windows. At the top a decorative cornice divides the upper floor from the Mansard roof, with wrought iron railing. In the interior, is a small atrium with circulation corridor for the cars; with tile wainscoting, plastered walls and azulejo tile the <b>main</b> <b>platform</b> is delimited by wrought iron gate and lateral staircases.|$|E
25|$|The union {{had both}} pragmatic and ideological elements. Because {{it was created}} in {{response}} to security concerns, when that threat was believed finished, the confederation's momentum began to die. Senegal unilaterally pulled out its troops from the Gambia when it was threatened by Mauritania (see Problems with Senegambia's border above). Gambia felt its interests were not being protected. The <b>main</b> <b>platform</b> on which union had been built was also the element on which it foundered. The end came on 23 August 1989, when President Diouf decided it was best that the confederation be placed aside after fruitless talks about a customs union.|$|E
25|$|With the {{decrease}} in passenger rail traffic, the station now serves more functions than the one {{for which it was}} designed. Bought by the Dunedin City Council in 1994, its uses have greatly diversified, though it still caters for the Dunedin Railways tourist trains. Much of the ground floor is used as a restaurant, and the upper floor is home to both the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame and the Otago Art Society. A produce market is held in the grounds to the north every Saturday morning. Every year in March, the station takes centre stage in the South Island's main fashion show, with the <b>main</b> <b>platform</b> becoming reputedly the world's longest catwalk.|$|E

25|$|Little {{remains of}} the castle {{features}} except the waist-high battlements, that served little more than lookout {{to the city of}} Angra. A double staircase connects the <b>main</b> <b>platform</b> from the path leading to the Gardens. Gardened and manicured, the spaces below the old castle are lined by endemic and flowering plants. Apart from the monument to D. Pedro IV, the only remnant to the fortifications use is an azulejo tile dedicated to the Fort of S√£o Lu√≠s located in the staircase. Remnants of the ravine canalization and mills are evident in the roads that lead from the park grounds, including along the Rua do Pis√£o, Rua do Garoupinha and Rua de Santo Esp√≠rito.|$|E
25|$|The El Duende group {{lies about}} 1km {{to the east}} of the site core. This group was built by Itzamnaaj K'awiil after his victory over Tikal in 705. ElDuende is the largest pyramid in the city, built by {{enlarging}} and terracing a natural hill some way from the site core, giving the impression of a single massive structure. The terraces supported five stelae and altar pairs, commissioned by Itzamnaaj K'awiil in the early 8th century AD. During excavations in 1991, a sinkhole near the western limit of the ElDuende complex discovered a 1.5km long cave that passes directly under the temple, which was named Cueva de R√≠o ElDuende (River Cave of ElDuende) by archaeologists. Within the cave were found abundant artifacts and human bones. Smaller buildings flank the <b>main</b> <b>platform.</b>|$|E
25|$|Maritime Line trains {{start from}} Truro railway station, usually {{originating}} {{from the bay}} platform, at {{the left side of}} the <b>main</b> <b>platform</b> beyond the footbridge. The trains join the main line for the first half-mile to Penwithers Junction, passing through the -long Higher Town Tunnel on the way. At this point the line to Penzance curves away to the right; the line to Falmouth was originally the Cornwall Railway main line and so runs straight ahead while the Penzance line was built by the West Cornwall Railway Company. The Maritime Line today only has a junction with the westbound track; trains running towards Truro come inbound on the same line as trains arriving from Penzance. The line from Penwithers to Falmouth Docks is single track, with the exception of the passing loop at Penryn.|$|E
25|$|The {{expansion}} {{also included}} {{the building of}} two signal boxes, one {{at each end of}} the station. It was possible to hear the bells in these boxes ringing from a point mid-way along the <b>main</b> <b>platforms.</b> Access to the yard became possible from the Down and Up through lines and the <b>main</b> Up (north) <b>platform.</b>|$|R
