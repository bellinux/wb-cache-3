40|$|The role of iron in <b>metal-bearing</b> <b>waste</b> {{bioleaching}} was studied. Four {{various types}} of waste (printed circuit boards (PCBs), Ni-Cd batteries, alkaline batteries and Li-ion batteries) were treated by bioleaching using the acidophilic bacteria A. ferrooxidans and A. thiooxidans (separately or in mixture). Role of main leaching agents (Fe 3 + ions or sulphuric acid) was simulated in abiotic experiments. Results showed that oxidation abilities of Fe 3 + ions were crucial for recovery of Cu and Zn from PCBs, with the efficiencies of 88 % and 100 %, respectively. To recover 68 % of Ni from PCBs, and 55 % and 100 % of Ni and Cd, respectively, from Ni-Cd batteries both oxidation action and hydrolysis of Fe 3 + were required. The importance of Fe 2 + ions as a reducing agent was showed in bioleaching of Co from Li-ion batteries and Mn from alkaline batteries. The efficiency of the processes has increased by 70 % and 40 % in Co and Mn bioleaching, respectively, {{in the presence of}} Fe 2 + ions. Based on the results we suggest the integrated biometallurgical model of <b>metal-bearing</b> <b>waste</b> recycling in the effort to develop zero-waste and less energy-dependent technologies...|$|R

Electroplating of the current-carrying aluminum bus bars and electrocoat painting of the external enclosures is conducted at the Jackson, Mississippi plant. These processes generate <b>metal-bearing</b> <b>waste</b> streams that require treatment before discharge to the sewer. Description of Plating and Painting- Processes The aluminum bus bars are plated with tin to prevent corrosion. The process involves cleaning, caustic etching, nitric acid pickling, phosphoric acid dip, and immersion in cyanide zincate solution before plating with a cyanide copper strike, followed by the final acid tin plate. After plating, the bus bars are removed from the racks, and the racks along with any rejected parts are stripped in nitric acid solution to remove plating before reuse. The cold roll and galvanized steel enclosures are pretreated in a six-stage washer prior to electrocoat painting. The parts are cleaned, phosphated, and then seale...|$|R
40|$|Nickel {{aluminate}} spinel {{phase was}} successfully sintered from the thermal reactions between nickel oxide and kaolinite or γ-alumina precursor, {{to simulate the}} stabilization mechanism of hazardous <b>metal-bearing</b> <b>waste</b> by ceramic matrix. The product phases were then tested using nano-indentation to obtain their nanohardness and Young's modulus, {{as a means to}} evaluate the properties of the product after incorporating the waste material. The results indicate the beneficial effect of forming aluminate spinel phase in the system due to its superior mechanical properties. A higher sintering temperature was found to enhance crystal growth in the spinel phase, together with its nanohardness and modulus. The minimum temperature for fabricating nickel aluminate spinel with a surface property comparable to ceramic materials was found to be 1200 °C, although the initiation of the spinel phase can be achieved at a lower temperature. Nano-indentation experiments performed on the spinel-containing samples leached by strong acid and alkaline solutions reveal the superiority of nickel aluminate spinel in resisting acid and alkaline attack and also suggest a reliable mechanism for hosting hazardous nickel in the crystal structure. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S. r. l. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Heavy <b>metal-bearing</b> <b>waste</b> usually needs solidification/stabilization (s/s) {{prior to}} {{landfill}} {{to lower the}} leaching rate. Cement is the most adaptable binder currently available for the immobilisation of heavy metals. The selection of cements and operating parameters depends upon an understanding of chemistry of the system. This paper discusses interactions of heavy metals and cement phases in the solidification/stabilisation process. It provides a clarification of heavy metal effects on cement hydration. According to the decomposition rate of minerals, heavy metals accelerate the hydration of tricalcium silicate (C 3 S) and Portland cement, although they retard the precipitation of portlandite due to the reduction of pH resulted from hydrolyses of heavy metal ions. The chemical mechanism relevant to the accelerating effect of heavy metals {{is considered to be}} H+ attacks on cement phases and the precipitation of calcium heavy metal double hydroxides, which consumes calcium ions and then promotes the decomposition of C 3 S. In this work, molecular models of calcium silicate hydrate gel are presented based on the examination of 29 Si solid-state magic angle spinning/nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS/NMR). This paper also reviews immobilisation mechanisms of heavy metals in hydrated cement matrices, focusing on the sorption, precipitation and chemical incorporation of cement hydration products. It is concluded that further research on the phase development during cement hydration in the presence of heavy metals and thermodynamic modelling is needed to improve effectiveness of cement-based s/s and extend this waste management technique...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the mechanisms of stabilizing lead-laden sludge by blending it into the production process of aluminum-rich ceramics, and quantitatively evaluated the prolonged leachability of the product phases. Sintering experiments were performed using powder mixtures of lead oxide and γ-alumina with different Pb/Al molar ratios within the temperature range of 600 - 1000 °C. By mixing lead oxide with γ-alumina at a Pb/Al molar ratio of 0. 5, the formation of PbAl 2 O 4 is initiated at 700 °C, but an effective formation was observed when the temperature was above 750 °C for a 3 -h sintering time. The formation and decomposition of the intermediate phase, Pb 9 Al 8 O 21, was detected in this system within the temperature range of 800 - 900 °C. When the lead oxide and γ-alumina mixture was sintered with a Pb/Al molar ratio of 1 : 12, the PbAl 12 O 19 phase was found at 950 °C and effectively formed at 1000 °C. In this system, an intermediate phase Pb 3 (CO 3) 2 (OH) 2 was observed at the temperature range of 700 - 950 °C. Over longer leaching periods, both PbAl 2 O 4 and PbAl 12 O 19 were superior to lead oxide in immobilizing lead. Comparing the leaching results of PbAl 2 O 4 and PbAl 12 O 19 demonstrated the higher intrinsic resistance of PbAl 12 O 19 against acid attack. To reduce metal mobility, this study demonstrated a preferred mechanism of stabilizing lead in the aluminate structures by adding <b>metal-bearing</b> <b>waste</b> sludge to the ceramic processing of aluminum-rich products. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory have {{developed}} a metal recovery system that meets the global treatment demands {{for all kinds of}} industrial and metal-processing streams. The Polymer Filtration (PF) System [...] a process that is easily operated and robust [...] offers metal-finishing businesses a convenient and inexpensive way to recover and recycle metal ions in-house, thus reducing materials costs, waste removal costs, and industrial liability. As a valuable economic and environmental asset, the PF System has been named a winner of a 1995 R and D 100 Award. These awards are presented annually by R and D Magazine to the one hundred most significant technical innovations of the year. The PF System is based on the use of water-soluble metal-binding polymers and on advanced ultrafiltration membranes. Customers for this technology will receive new soluble polymers, especially formulated for their waste stream, and the complete PF processing unit: a reaction reservoir, pumps, plumbing, controls, and the advanced ultrafiltration membranes, all in a skid mounted frame. <b>Metal-bearing</b> <b>waste</b> water is treated in the reaction reservoir, where the polymer binds with the metal ions under balanced acid/base conditions.

40|$|A Generic Technology for {{treatment}} of DOE Metal-Bearing Liquid <b>Waste</b> The DOE <b>metal-bearing</b> liquid <b>waste</b> inventory is large and diverse, both {{with respect to the}} metals (heavy metals, transuranics, radionuclides) themselves, {{and the nature of the}} other species (annions, organics, etc.) present. Separation and concentration of metals is of interest from the standpoint of reducing the volume of waste that will require special treatment or isolation, as well as, potentially, from the standpoint of returning some materials to commerce by recycling. The variety of <b>metal-bearing</b> liquid <b>waste</b> in the DOE complex is so great that it is unlikely that any one process (or class of processes) will be suitable for all material. However, processes capable of dealing with a wide variety of wastes will have major advantages in terms of process development, capital, and operating costs, as well as in environmental and safety permitting. Moreover, to the extent that a process operates well with a variety of metal-bearing liquid feedwastes, its performance is likely to be relatively robust with respect to the inevitable composition variations in each waste feed. One such class of processes involves high-temperature treatment of atomized liquid waste to promote reactive capture of volatile metallic species on collectible particulate substrates injected downstream of a flame zone. Compared to low-temperature processes that remove metals from the original liquid phase by extraction, precipitation, ion exchange, etc., some of the attractive features of high-temperature reactive scavenging are: The organic constituents of some <b>metal-bearing</b> liquid <b>wastes</b> (in particular, some low-level mixed wastes) must be treated thermally in order to meet the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), and the laws of various states. No species need be added to an already complex liquid system. This is especially important in light of the fact that DOE has already experienced problems with organic complexants added to precipitate radionuclides. For example, the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board has expressed, in a formal Recommendation to the Secretary of Energy, its concern about the evolution of benzene vapor in concentrations greater then the lower flammability limit from tanks to which sodium tetraphenylborate has been added to precipitate 137 Cs in the ''In-Tank Precipitation'' (ITP) process at the Savannah River Site. Other species added to the waste in the ITP process are sodium titanate (to adsorb 90 Sr and Pu), and oxalic acid. Avoiding addition of organics to radioactive waste has the additional advantage that is likely to significantly reduce the rate of radiolytic and radiolytically-induced hydrogen generation (c. f. Meisel et al., [1993]), in which it is shown that removal of organics reduces the rate of hydrogen generation in simulated waste from Hanford tank 241 -SY- 101 by over 70 %. Organic species already present are destroyed with very high efficiency. This attribute is especially attractive with respect to high-level tank waste at the Hanford Site, in which large amounts of citrate, glyoxylate, EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), and HEDTA [N-(2 - hydroxyethyl) -ethylenediaminetriacetic acid] were added to precipitate radionuclides. These organic species are important in the thermal and radiolytic generation of methane, hydrogen, and nitrous oxide, flammable mixtures of which are episodically vented from 25 tanks on Hanford's Flammable Gas Watch List [Hopkins, 1994]. The same basic approach can be used to treat a broad range of liquid wastes, in each case concentrating the metals (regardless of liquid-phase oxidation state or association with chelators or absorbents) using a collectible sorbent, and destroying any organic species present. In common with the Army's approach (see section 2. 2) to the thermal destruction of a 10 range of chemical warfare agents (GB, VX, and two blister agents), this may drastically simplify process and plant design and facility permitting, and reduce capital costs, by avoiding development of a separate ''wet'' process for each type of liquid waste source. The expected robustness of the process with respect to gross feedwaste composition suggests a relatively high degree of tolerance with respect to inevitable variations in the composition of a given metal-bearing feedwaste. For these reasons, high-temperature reactive scavenging is a potentially attractive approach to the removal of metals from liquid waste in the DOE complex. 2. 2.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to develop the fundamental science base necessary to assess the utility of high-temperature processes to volatilize metals in DOE <b>metal-bearing</b> liquid <b>wastes,</b> {{so that they can}} be reactively scavenged by sorbents. The problem is addressed through a collaborative research program involving a team of five senior scientists and their respective laboratories, at four institutions. Specific goals are to: (1) Understand high-temperature reaction kinetics between sorbent substrates and certain volatile and semi-volatile metals in the DOE liquid waste inventory (e. g., Cs and Sr), using a laminar-flow reactor for which extraction of kinetic data is not complicated by turbulence; (2) Develop models to predict both trajectories of individual droplets in turbulent high-temperature reactors, and rates of metal evolution from droplets, and compare model predictions with experimental data from a pilot-scale turbulent thermal reactor; (3) Connect the reaction kinetic models with the droplet trajectory/mass evolution models, in order to predict and optimize metal scavenging processes in turbulent-flow reactors, and to test these combined models against data taken from a turbulent high temperature reactor. This report summarizes work at a point midway through the first year of a 3 -year project. At the University of Arizona (UA), two tasks are underway. The first task is concerned with attempting to understand high-temperature reaction kinetics between sorbent substrates and certain volatile and semi-volatile metals. The second task is concerned with applying Kerstein''s One Dimensional Turbulence model to prediction of droplet trajectories in turbulent flow. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{large portion}} of the Department of Energy (DOE) {{radioactive}} waste inventory is composed of <b>metal-bearing</b> liquid <b>wastes,</b> {{which may or may not}} also contain organics. It is highly desirable to concentrate the metals in order to reduce the volume of these wastes and to render them into an environmentally benign form. One method for doing this is to exploit high-temperatures to reactively capture metals by sorbents, and thus to isolate them from the environment. The objective of this research is to provide the background information necessary to design a process that accomplishes this on a large scale, namely in hot turbulent flows, into which are injected the wastes to be treated and, also the sorbents that scavenge the metals. The current work focuses on cesium and strontium, which are present in the DOE inventory as radioactive isotopes. The project involves five investigators at three institutions, and is comprised of the following parts: (1) Experimental research at the University of Arizona focuses on the chemistry of cesium and strontium sorption on kaolinite and lime sorbents in a laminar flow environment. (2) Theoretical research pursued jointly by the University of Arizona and Sandia Laboratories, Livermore, focuses on prediction of droplet trajectories in a turbulent flow environment. (3) Experimental research at the Air Pollution Technology Branch of the US Environmental Protection Agency, to investigate the process in turbulent flows. (4) Experimental research at the University of Illinois focuses on design, construction, and application of a laser based LIBS system for measuring droplet size, metal concentration in the gas phase, and metal concentration in the vapor phase.

40|$|In {{many parts}} of the world, metal(loid) s {{resulting}} from mining activities are causing significant environmental concern, in particular because they are contaminating agricultural lands. In this respect, a previous study in South Korea suggested that a specific agricultural practice, associated with the growing of rice in paddy fields, could contribute specifically to the geographic spread of metal(loid) s contamination away from mine sites. The purpose of the research described in this article was to confirm this hypothesis at a different site. Samples from the surface soil of agricultural lands were collected from 374 sites (267 paddy soils and 107 dry field soils). The concentrations of As, Pb, Cd, Cu and Zn from the samples were analyzed and descriptive statistics and multivariate statistical analysis were carried out to identify potential sources of these various elements. In addition, geographical information systems (GIS) technology was applied to analyze the interrelationship between the mining activities and the distribution of meta(loid) s in agricultural lands. The results clearly show that the transport and distribution of As and Pb originating from the abandoned mine are distinct depending on the agricultural practice that was adopted locally. The highest concentrations of As and Pb are in agricultural soils nearest the abandoned mine site (< 1 km) because of climatic factors such as wind and precipitation that affect the direct mobilization of <b>metal-bearing</b> mine <b>wastes.</b> However, the distribution characteristics of As and Pb in the oxidizing environment of dry field soils in general suggest that the degree of pollution by these elements fell notably as the distance from the abandoned mine increased. In the alternatingly oxidizing and reducing environment of paddy soils, by contrast, the distribution of As and Pb is noticeably {{different from those of the}} dry field soils. Arsenic in particular is widely distributed across the study area with a high level of pollution regardless of the distance from the abandoned mine. These results confirm the hypothesis that the transport characteristics of metal(loid) s initially mobilized from an abandoned mine site into the paddy soils are predominantly governed by the specific submerged environment of rice paddy soils and these specific environments impact a wider area than climatic factors...|$|R
