5|$|The {{perception}} of greenness (in opposition to redness forming {{one of the}} opponent mechanisms in human color vision) is evoked by light which triggers the medium-wavelength M cone cells in the eye <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> long-wavelength L cones.

Jack White, one of the three, is the club's leading wicket-taker in first-class cricket, claiming 2,165 dismissals for the county between 1909 and 1937.

5|$|Despite high aspirations, the Metroliner cars {{proved to}} have poor reliability, {{with less than}} two-thirds of the fleet in service at many times.

Thirty-three more cars were overhauled in 1979–1980. However, by this time, new AEM-7 locomotives pulling Amfleet cars could match Metroliner schedules with higher reliability. Metroliners were withdrawn from Metroliner service entirely in 1981; they served until 1988 on Keystone Service trains.|$|E
