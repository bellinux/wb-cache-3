500|$|The {{success of}} Chuck Dixon’s Black Canary/Oracle: Birds of Prey (1996) {{led to the}} comic series Birds of Prey {{starring}} the two title characters. During Chuck Dixon's crossover series Nightwing: Hunt for Oracle, Barbara Gordon and Dinah Lance meet in person and establish a long-term friendship. They form {{the nucleus of the}} Birds of Prey organization. While Oracle serves as the basic head of operations, Black Canary becomes her full-time employee and field agent. In 2000, the first Batgirl monthly comic was launched with Cassandra Cain as the title character. Oracle appears as a supporting character throughout the series, acting as a mentor to the new Batgirl, alongside Batman. Gail Simone took over as writer of Birds of Prey with issue #56. In an interview, Simone explained her fondness for Barbara Gordon, stating: [...] "Kim Yale and John Ostrander picked up the character and made her into a brilliant <b>master</b> <b>computer</b> operator {{and one of the most}} fascinating characters in comics. From there, Chuck Dixon did wonderful things with her in his Birds of Prey run ... She’s fantastic because even just sitting in a chair in a dark room by herself, she’s tremendously compelling. The DCU without her would be a much less interesting place." [...] Simone integrates the Huntress into the comic, making her a central character in the series as Oracle's secondary field agent. In 2003, comic book authors Scott Beatty and Chuck Dixon revised Barbara Gordon’s origin with the miniseries [...] Gordon is a highly gifted child having graduated from high school early, but initially desires to join law enforcement as opposed to vigilantism in the previous origin myths.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{power system}} {{operates}} safely and stably {{depends on the}} reliable operation of electric automation system of which the <b>master</b> control <b>computer</b> is the core. To improve the reliability, security and real-time performance of the <b>master</b> control <b>computer,</b> the error-tolerant model of <b>master</b> control <b>computer</b> based on replication technology for electronic automation system is built and the implementing method of model is introduced in great detail. For the defects of dual-computer hot backup system and {{on the basis of}} three-machine voting system, the error-tolerant model of <b>master</b> control <b>computer</b> designed in this paper makes some improvements in system structure and voting algorithm,so as to provide a reference for the construction of electronic automation system in the “strong ” and "self-healing " smart grid...|$|R

In 2191, New Earth has a <b>Master</b> <b>Computer</b> that holds a secret database of the colony-planet's functioning. In wrong hands, the database could prove fatal to the whole planet. One day, aliens attack the <b>Master</b> <b>Computer,</b> making the Master control program malfunction. Nova, a lord of the ancient Power Blade is summoned {{to take care of}} the situation. The Power Blade is a glowing energy boomerang that Nova uses to defend himself.|$|E
