The Astros would later select him with the second overall pick in the 1969 amateur baseball draft, behind the Washington Senators' selection of outfielder Jeff Burroughs. Richard later recalled, [...] "There were other guys in <b>my</b> <b>high</b> school with as much ability as I had, but instead of working at a job, they wanted to drink wine on Saturday nights. They {{thought that was the}} in thing to do, and consequently our lives went in different directions. For some people it takes that to make a world. It does not for me." ...|$|E
500|$|Steiger {{was offered}} the title role in Patton (1970), but turned it down {{because he did not}} want to glorify war. The role was then given to George C. Scott, who won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance. Steiger called this refusal his [...] "dumbest career move", remarking, [...] "I got on <b>my</b> <b>high</b> horse. I thought I was a pacifist." [...] Instead, he chose to portray Napoleon Bonaparte {{opposite}} Christopher Plummer in Sergei Bondarchuk's Waterloo (1970), a co-production between the Soviet Union and Italy. One commentator wrote: [...] "I watched with extraordinary respect, no, that is not the right word, with enthusiasm, the acting of Rod Steiger in the role of Napoleon in Waterloo," [...] while literary critic Daniel S. Burt describes Steiger's Napoleon as an [...] "unusual interpretation", finding him less convincing than Plummer's Wellington.|$|E

On making the team, Swanigan said, [...] "I always set goals for myself. I set goals for this spring. One of my goals is to make this team to end <b>my</b> <b>high</b> school career." [...] To prepare for the games, Swanigan played in the Nike Hoop Summit, McDonald's All American Game, and the Jordan Brand Classic. Swanigan did not take part in the Indiana-Kentucky All Star Game so he could attend the U19 training camp. He was one of five player's returning from the gold medal winning U17 squad. Swanigan's teammate Vince Edwards was also in the running to make the team, but was cut at the round of 16. The team finished 7–0, and Swanigan averaged 6.1 points and 4.4 rebounds per game.|$|E
500|$|York's run of two {{straight}} losses ended after drawing 0–0 {{at home to}} Portsmouth, in which Brunt missed a header from fouryards in the third minute of stoppage time. Sheffield United's 19-year-old striker Diego De Girolamo, an Italy under-20 international, joined on a one-month youth loan {{as a result of}} injuries to Coulson, Fletcher and Hyde. De Girolamo scored seven minutes into his debut away to Newport County with a low finish, but after Penn was sent off for a second bookable offence the home team scored three goals in the second half, York losing the match 3–1. With York one place above the relegation zone Worthington resigned as manager, and was quoted saying [...] "In recent weeks, performances have not been up to <b>my</b> <b>high</b> standards and I take full responsibility for this". Steve Torpey, who was Worthington's assistant manager, took over as caretaker manager before Russ Wilcox was appointed as manager two days after Worthington's departure. Wilcox had been sacked as Scunthorpe United manager a week earlier with them second from bottom in the League One table, having led them to promotion the previous season as League Two runners-up.|$|E

She was national champion both indoors and outdoors that year and represented Ukraine at the 2008 Summer Olympics. She was an 800m semi-finalist and also ran in the heats with the Ukrainian 4×400 metres relay team. She did not compete in the remaining IAAF Golden League meets as she was called back to Kiev to be presented with an apartment in recognition of her achievements. However, this never materialised and her season ended prematurely. She later remarked on the affair: [...] "They said that my participation was obligatory, because the mayor of Kiev had to give me keys for a new apartment in the Ukrainian capital.

[...] Yet I find it such an odd incident that my bench mate, from my failing grade year through to <b>my</b> <b>high</b> school graduation, was [...] this tiny man of a rare originality, who had a massive say on how my life would turn up." [...] Ciprian describes what follows as his own [...] "initiation in artistic matters": he recalls conversations with [...] "Ciriviș" [...] where they debated the [...] "perfection" [...] of Ancient Greek sculpture, and mentions that young Urmuz, unlike himself, regarded theater as a [...] "minor art". Instead, Urmuz preferred to attend concerts at the Romanian Atheneum, and, Ciprian writes, had an advanced understanding of absolute music even at age thirteen. Reportedly, the young man was also in the attendance at lectures given by Titu Maiorescu, a philosopher and aesthete who had influenced both Eminescu and Caragiale.|$|E
2500|$|Stack says {{he became}} {{involved}} in politics through his parents, who took him to political rallies in Union City.

[...] It was with his parents that Stack first began {{to participate in the}} practice of providing turkeys and holiday gifts to the needy, a practice that Stack would later institute as Mayor As Stack explained to a reporter when he was 19, [...] "I remember when I was about 6 or 7 years old being at the Doric Temple polling place on election day just sitting and listening to the local politicians. I would probably say I dedicated <b>my</b> <b>high</b> school years to politics when I guess I should have been more into school activities. My classmates would call me 'mayor'.

2500|$|According to his {{acceptance}} speech for the Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1998, Ron's interest in writing mathematics textbooks started the summer after his sophomore year in college. [...] "In my sophomore year I decided to switch to math. I wasn't prepared for it. I had forgotten <b>my</b> <b>high</b> school algebra and trig, and I had to spend my sophomore year taking those courses over again. After I was accepted to Lewis & Clark, I made an appointment {{to talk with the}} math department chair, Elvy Fredrickson. That was in June 1964. I asked Elvy if she would let me squeeze four years of math into my junior and senior years at Lewis & Clark. To imagine her thoughts, {{you have to remember that}} I had not even taken a course in freshman calculus. I didn't then know what Elvy was thinking. I only knew what she said and what she did. She went to a bookshelf in her office in the old math building, scanned the titles, took down a calculus text, handed it to me, and said, 'Study this book during the summer. The week before classes start in the fall, I will give you a test. If you pass, I will let you take your sophomore and junior mathematics courses concurrently. By the time you reach your senior year, you will be on track.' [...] Years later, Elvy told me that she had no idea I would actually do it. But, I had no idea that she had no ideaand so I took her up on her offer. I read the calculus book, passed the test, and started taking third-semester calculus and linear algebra in the fall of 1964." ...|$|E
