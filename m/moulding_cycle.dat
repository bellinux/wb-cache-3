40|$|An optical {{technique}} for monitoring the solidification of thermoplastics in an {{injection moulding machine}} was implemented. The technique uses a He-Ne laser that illuminates the mould cavity, and a photomultiplier to measure the intensity of reflected light during the <b>moulding</b> <b>cycle.</b> Data from the sensor allows tracking the injection <b>moulding</b> <b>cycle</b> development. The measured light intensity is mainly influenced by refraction and reflection phenomena at the melt-solid interfaces during solidification.

A new IMD process has been developed to produce a painted component direct from the injection moulding tool. This incorporates the pressure spraying of thermoset powders through a valve into a closed mould. The residual heat of the tool initially softens the thermoset.

They are usually single cavity moulds, but may be multi-cavity if the moulding is quite small. They are usually only of a two or three plate design because of {{the simplicity of the}} parts. If only a short run is required then the moulds may be made from aluminum or brass, but if more parts are required then they are made from conventional steels.|$|R
40|$|Polymeric micro {{parts and}} micro/nano scale features, as {{typically}} found on miniature medical devices and microfluidic chips, are mainly {{produced by the}} micro injection moulding process, because of its mass production capability. Because of high surface to volume ratios, filling small cavities and tiny features requires high temperature and high speed {{in order to prevent}} short shots from premature solidification. The polymer melts are consequently subject to high shear rates and thermal gradients. This thesis has characterized the micro injection moulding process, polymer rheological behaviour at the micro scale, micro/nano feature replication, and morphology development and mechanical properties of micro parts and micro features. An in-line process monitoring system was developed to characterize filling, packing, and cooling of a typical micro component having a large sprue and runner. A shot size optimization method was proposed, which successfully eliminates the effect of machine switchover and holding pressure on the cavity filling process. Using a slit flow model, polymer melt viscosity at the micro scale was found to be dependent on cavity thickness and was lower than conventional viscosity, which is attributed to wall slip and non-isothermal flow. Replication of multi-scale features, ranging from hundreds of microns to as small as 100 nm, has been successfully achieved by micro injection moulding using Bulk Metallic Glass tool inserts. Feature replication is characterized with respect to the moulding process and to the material, design, and feature configuration. Bulk Metallic Glass tools can successfully retain mould patterns for ~ 20, 000 <b>moulding</b> <b>cycles.</b> Poly (ether block amide) micro parts exhibit some unique morphological features: spherulite-free core, larger spherulites between a skin layer and fine-grained layer/core layer. Shear stress was shown to be a successful threshold for the onset of an orientated structure by comparing the micro injection moulding process to a "short-term shear protocol". The morphology of the micro features was found to be {{similar to that of the}} core region, and the skin layer deformed into micro feature cavities depending on local pressure.
