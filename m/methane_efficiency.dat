Municipal or industrial sewage does not, however, provide for the effective biogas production, mainly on account of their chemical composition. The objective of the paper was to verify sus-ceptibility to the methanation process of the selected organic sub-strates (refined glycerine, beet molasses, whey) with sewage sludge. The scope of the research covered initial analysis of the raw material (pH, dry mass, dry organic mass), methane fermentation of the suita-bly prepared samples of fermentation mixtures and the assessment of biogas and <b>methane</b> <b>efficiency.</b> The highest concentration of methane was obtained from the mixture of sewage sludge with refined glycer-ine (63. 10 %), whereas the lowest – from the mixture with whey (49. 8 %).

Starting with impurity concentrations near 10 ^{- 6 } g/g, the outlet impurity level {{is found to be}} less than 120 * 10 ^{- 12 } g/g for O 2 and less than 950 * 10 ^{- 12 } g/g for N 2. For methane we find residual contamination of the purified gas at concentrations varying over three orders of magnitude, depending on the purifier temperature and the gas flow rate. A slight reduction in the purifier's <b>methane</b> <b>efficiency</b> is observed after 13 mg of this impurity has been absorbed, which we attribute to partial exhaustion of the purifier's capacity for this species. We also find that the purifier's ability to absorb N 2 and methane can be extinguished long before any decrease in O 2 performance is observed, and slower flow rates should be employed for xenon purification due to the cooling effect that the heavy gas has on the getter.

40|$|Most {{microbial}} electrolysis cells (MECs) contain only {{a single}} set of electrodes. In order to examine the scalability of a multiple-electrode design, we constructed a 2. 5 L MEC containing 8 separate electrode pairs made of graphite fiber brush anodes pre-acclimated for current generation using acetate, and 304 stainless steel mesh cathodes (64 m 2 /m 3). Under continuous flow conditions and a one day hydraulic retention time, the maximum current was 181 mA (1. 18 A/m 2, cathode surface area; 74 A/m 3) within three days of operation. The maximum hydrogen production (day 3) was 0. 53 L/L-d, reaching an energy efficiency relative to electrical energy input of ηE = 144 %. Current production remained relatively steady (days 3 - 18), but the gas composition dramatically shifted over time. By day 16, there was little H 2 gas recovered and methane production increased from 0. 049 L/L-d (day 3) to 0. 118 L/L-d. When considering the energy value of both hydrogen and <b>methane,</b> <b>efficiency</b> relative to electrical input remained above 100 % until {{near the end of}} the experiment (day 17) when only methane gas was being produced. Our results show that MECs can be scaled up primarily based on cathode surface area, but that hydrogen can be completely consumed in a continuous flow system unless methanogens can be completely eliminated from the system. © 2010 Professor T.

40|$|Because of {{the strong}} {{adsorption}} capacity of meta-anthracite, the gas content of a meta-anthracite seam can {{be as high as}} 10 m 3 /t, with a gas pressure lower than 0. 74 MPa; this results in low efficiency of gas extraction in underground mines. To enhance low-pressure <b>methane</b> extraction <b>efficiency</b> in meta-anthracite seams, a new approach – methane displacement by gas injection – has been developed, investigated in the laboratory, and then applied in the field in the Fuyanshan coal mine. Laboratory results show that when the gas content of the coal seam is high, methane displacement by nitrogen injection is difficult. The volume of methane displaced {{is directly related to the}} pressure difference between the coal seam gas pressure and the injection gas pressure. If the total gas pressure is greater than 0. 5 MPa after nitrogen injection, then the <b>methane</b> displacement <b>efficiency</b> will be greatly enhanced.

However, economically and safely producing methane from gas hydrate deposits is still not on the drawing board.

40|$|Fossil fuels {{dominate}} the world energy supply {{today and the}} transport sector is no exception. Renewable alternatives must therefore be introduced to replace fossil fuels and their emissions, without sacrificing our standard of living. There is a good potential for biofuels but process improvements are essential, to ensure efficient use of {{a limited amount of}} biomass and better compete with fossil alternatives. The general aim of this research is therefore to investigate how to improve efficiency in biofuel production by process development and co-generation of heat and electricity. The work has been divided into three parts; power cycles in biofuel production, methane production via pyrolysis and biofuels from renewable electricity. The studies of bio-based methanol plants showed that steam power generation has {{a key role in the}} large-scale biofuel production process. However, a large portion of the steam from the recovered reaction heat is needed in the fuel production process. One measure to increase steam power generation, evaluated in this thesis, is to lower the steam demand by humidification of the gasification agent. Pinch analysis indicated synergies from gas turbine integration and our studies concluded that the electrical efficiency for natural gas fired gas turbines amounts to 56 - 58 %, in the same range as for large combined cycle plants. The use of the off-gas from the biofuel production is also a potential integration option but difficult for modern high-efficient gas turbines. Furthermore, gasification with oxygen and extensive syngas cleaning might be too energy-consuming for efficient power generation. Methane production via pyrolysis showed improved efficiency compared with the competing route via gasification. The total biomass to <b>methane</b> <b>efficiency,</b> including additional biomass to fulfil the power demand, was calculated to 73 - 74 %. The process benefits from lower thermal losses and less reaction heat when syngas is avoided as an intermediate step and can handle high-alkali fuels such as annual crops. Several synergies were discovered when integrating conventional biofuel production with addition of hydrogen. Introducing hydrogen would also greatly increase the biofuel production potential for regions with limited biomass resources. It was also concluded that methane produced from electrolysis of water could be economically feasible if the product was priced in parity with petrol. QC 20121127 </p...|$|E

40|$|A {{sequencing}} {{batch reactor}} with microalgal bacterial flocs (MaB-floc SBR) {{is a novel}} solar-based system to treat wastewater. During this aerobic treatment process, solar energy is harnessed and wastewater nutrients are recovered into microalgal bacterial biomass. To further improve the economics of this MaB-floc SBR system, the produced biomass should be valorized, for example as feedstock for anaerobic digestion to biogas. Therefore, batch experiments were carried out to evaluate the biochemical methane potential (BMP) of MaB-flocs originating from treatment of aquaculture wastewater in an outdoor pilot reactor in Belgium.

Results Results show that compared to HFS 1, emissions (72. 3 ± 0. 96 kg CH 4 /animal/life; least squares means± standard error of the mean) were 15 %, 6 %, and 23 % lower (p< 0. 01) for the HFS 2, HFS 3, and HFS 4, respectively. The predicted <b>methane</b> <b>efficiencies</b> (CO 2 eq) per kg of LW at slaughter (4. 3 ± 0. 15), carcass weight (8. 8 ± 0. 25 kg) and kg of edible protein (44. 1 ± 1. 29) were also lower (p< 0. 05) in the HFS 4. In particular, irrespective of the HSF, feed supply and ratio changes had a more positive impact on emission intensities when crossbred 1 / 2 Red Angus cattle were fed than in their crossbred counterparts. Conclusion Modest improvements on feeding practices and integrated modelling frameworks may offer potential trade-offs to respond to climate change in Vietnam...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} is to develop an {{experimental}} scheme for realization of methanation reaction (CO 2 + 4 H 2 → CH 4 + 2 H 2 O) realization. The existing experimental stands show that there are many factors and reaction parameters that may negatively act on CO 2 conversion. The highest CO 2 conversion rates are achieved at the temperature range of 300 – 400 °C. <b>Methane</b> production <b>efficiency</b> also depends on reactor's space velocity, reaction's stoichiometry, catalyst's surface area and type. Nickel and Ruthenium are the most popular catalysts. Gas contaminants (like NO 2, O 2 and SO 2) which may be in exhaust flow, act negatively on the reaction. According to this great amount of aspects acting on methanation process positive outcome special scheme was developed. It combines not only inlet gas properties, proper catalyst or reactor design selection, but also technical aspects such as preheating/mixing chamber and condensing unit design. This summarizing scheme will be used for real methnation reactor design in the future studies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Methane is {{a potent}} {{atmospheric}} greenhouse gas (GHG) and second only to carbon dioxide as a contributor to global warming. To reduce the methane emissions, a thermal reverse flow reactor packed with the ceramic honeycomb monoliths was developed. The methane thermal oxidation characteristics were studied experimentally. Different methane concentrations (0. 2 - 1 %) on a volume basis were used for experiments of the methane oxidation in the reverse flow reactor. The {{results show that the}} lean methane oxidation that are not normally auto-thermal can be run and sustained in the reverse flow reactor; the <b>methane</b> conversion <b>efficiency</b> achieved is over 95 %; the lowest methane concentration limit at which methane will oxidize reliably is approximately 0. 3 %; the highest temperature in the reactor is lower than the detrimental temperature of the ceramic monolith, the stability and reliability of the reactor can be ensured. Also, {{it was found that the}} influence of the switch time on the performance of a reverse flow reactor is significant. The principles to optimize the switch time and methods to determine the optimal switch time are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper presents: (1) the {{electricity}} and hydrogen co-production concept, (2) a thermodynamic analysis methodology for studying solid oxide and molten carbonate fuel cell hydrogen co-production, and (3) simulation results {{that address the}} impact of reformer placement in the cycle on system performance. The methodology is based on detailed thermodynamic and electrochemical principles that apply {{to each of the}} system components and the integrated cycles. Eight different cycle configurations that use fuel cell heat to drive hydrogen production in a reformer are proposed, analyzed, and compared. The specific cycle configurations include SOFC and MCFC cycles using both external and internal reforming options. The fuel cell plant performance has been evaluated on the basis of <b>methane</b> utilization <b>efficiency</b> and each component of the plant has been evaluated on the basis of second law efficiency. The analyses show that in all cases the exergy losses (irreversibilities) in the combustion chamber are the most significant losses in the cycle. Furthermore, for the same power output, the internal reformation option has the higher electrical efficiency and produces more hydrogen per unit of fuel supplied, in the case of using a SOFC.
