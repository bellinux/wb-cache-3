5|$|Although Balzac {{himself did}} not marry until 1850, he {{was fascinated by}} the subject. Soon after Les Chouans was {{published}} in 1829, he released a treatise about the institution called Physiologie du <b>Mariage.</b> His attention to the details of relationships – failed and successful – are woven into Les Chouans, and Marie herself is based on a woman with whom he had had an affair.|$|E
5|$|His first efforts, {{published}} under {{a variety}} of pseudonyms, were cheaply printed potboiler novels. In 1829 he finally released a novel under his own name, titled Les Chouans; it was a minor success, though it did not earn the author enough money to relieve his considerable debt. He found fame soon afterwards with a series of novels including La Physiologie du <b>mariage</b> (1829), Sarrasine (1830), and La Peau de chagrin (1831).|$|E
5|$|He {{published}} for {{the first}} time under his own name in 1829. Les Chouans, a novel about royalist forces in Brittany, did not succeed commercially, but it made Balzac known in literary circles. He achieved a major success later the same year when he published La Physiologie du <b>mariage,</b> a treatise on the institution of marriage. Bolstered by its popularity, he added to his fame by publishing a variety of short stories and essays in the magazines Revue de Paris, La Caricature, and La Mode. He thus made connections in the publishing industry that later helped him to obtain reviews of his novels.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the writers}} who most enchanted Hańska was the French novelist Honoré de Balzac. After laboring in pseudonymous obscurity for ten years, Balzac {{published}} Les Chouans (The Chouans) in 1829. A tale of star-crossed love amidst a royalist uprising in Brittany, {{it was the first}} work to which he signed his own name. Hańska was intrigued by the glowing portrayal of the female protagonist, driven by true love to protect the object of her desire. She also enjoyed Balzac's Physiologie du <b>mariage</b> (The Physiology of Marriage), also published in 1829, which heaps satirical scorn on husbands and celebrates the virtue of married women.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of the novel extended to Ukraine, where a baroness named Ewelina Hańska read about Balzac's novels in newspapers she received from Paris. Intrigued, she ordered copies of his work, and she read them with her cousins and friends around Volhynia. They were impressed by the understanding he showed toward women in La Physiologie du <b>mariage,</b> but felt that La Peau de chagrin portrayed them in a cruel and unforgiving light. Hańska {{wrote a letter to}} Balzac, signed it as L'Étrangère ("The Stranger"), and mailed it from Odessa on 28 February 1832.|$|E
5|$|The Aboriginal group {{forms the}} inner centre {{piece in the}} tondo of both bowls. As the same image was used for both bowls, the {{implication}} is that the Chinese ceramic painters were copying from the same drawing and finishing them at the same place and time. The image is of a group of four Aboriginal men with club, shield and spears, one woman with a baby on her shoulders – standing and turned slightly away {{from the rest of the}} figures – and another woman cowed by the men. This is thought to depict a preliminary marriage ceremony. As with the Museum bowl's Sydney Cove image, no directly related, surviving, version is known that would have been used by the ceramic artists to paint the Aboriginal group. The closest match is a drawing after an apparently now-lost original sketch by Nicolas-Martin Petit, artist on the 1800–1803 French expedition to Australia led by Nicolas Baudin. Research made around 2009–2012, indicated that during Baudin's expedition, a report was prepared for Emperor Napoleon on the feasibility of capturing the British colony at Sydney Cove. As this expedition progressed around coastal Australia, Petit began to specialise in the drawing of portraits of indigenous peoples. The French expedition arrived at Port Jackson on 25April 1802. Petit's drawing was copied for publication as plate 114 in the Voyage autour du monde : entrepris par ordre du roi (Paris, 1825) , regarding a voyage around the world (1817–1820) led by Louis-Claude de Saulces de Freycinet. The engraving is entitled Port Jackson, Nlle Hollande. Ceremonie preliminaire d'un <b>mariage,</b> chez les sauvages (ceremony before a marriage among the natives, Port Jackson, New Holland). Port Jackson aborigines are from the Eora group of indigenous people living in the Sydney Basin.|$|E

25|$|To {{a lesser}} degree, the Figaro plays are semi-autobiographical. Don Guzman Brid'oison (Le <b>Mariage)</b> and Bégearss (La Mère) were caricatures {{of two of}} Beaumarchais's real-life adversaries, Goezman and Bergasse. The page Chérubin (Le <b>Mariage)</b> resembled the {{youthful}} Beaumarchais, who did contemplate suicide when his love was to marry another. Suzanne, the heroine of Le <b>Mariage</b> and La Mère, was modelled after Beaumarchais's third wife, Marie-Thérèse de Willer-Mawlaz. Meanwhile, some of the Count monologues reflect on the playwright's remorse over his numerous sexual exploits.|$|E

25|$|Who can be ignorant {{that woman}} {{was created for}} man, and not man for woman; and that a husband may be inju'd as insufferably in <b>mariage</b> as a wife.

25|$|Lully's {{collaboration}} with the playwright Molière began with Les Fâcheux in 1661, when Lully provided a single sung courante, added after the work's premiere at Nicolas Fouquet's sumptuous chateau of Vaux-le-Vicomte. Their collaboration began in earnest in 1664 with Le <b>Mariage</b> forcé. More collaborations followed, some of them conceived for fetes at the royal court, and others taking the form of incidental music (intermèdes) for plays performed at command performances at court and also in Molière's Parisian theater.|$|E
25|$|The {{second season}} {{opened with a}} piece by Henri Bernstein, Le Secret, which had already played on Broadway.

Among the other successes was Henrik Ibsen's Rosmersholm in a translation by Agnès Thomsen Copeau with Dullin as Rosmer and Copeau in the role of Kroll.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} 68 {{characters}} listed by Pitou is incomplete. In fact, the roles Lays created amount {{to at least}} 72 (cf next section). Moreover, this obviously {{does not include the}} roles Lays did not create directly (including those already mentioned, such as Thésée in Sacchini's Œdipe à Colone, Oreste in Iphigénie en Tauride and Cynire in Echo et Narcisse, both by Gluck, as well as Patrocle in the same composer's Iphigénie en Aulide and Figaro in Le <b>Mariage</b> de Figaro by Mozart). Lays's contribution to the Opéra repertoire, which lasted over forty years, was astonishing, and the long duration of the singer's career and the good vocal form he maintained to the last suggest that Fétis's adverse judgement on his technical skills should be accepted only with caution.|$|E
25|$|Le Barbier premiered in 1775. Its sequel, Le <b>Mariage,</b> was {{initially}} {{passed by the}} censor in 1781, but was soon banned from being performed by Louis XVI after a private reading. Queen Marie-Antoinette lamented the ban, as did various influential members of her entourage. Nonetheless, the King was unhappy with the play's satire on the aristocracy and overruled the Queen's entreaties to allow its performance. Over the next three years, Beaumarchais gave many private readings of the play, as well as making revisions to try to pass the censor. The King finally relented and lifted the ban in 1784. The play premiered that year and was enormously popular even with aristocratic audiences. Mozart's opera premiered just two years later. Beaumarchais's final play, La Mère, premiered in 1792 in Paris.|$|E

500|$|Although {{he married}} late in life, Balzac had already written two treatises on marriage: Physiologie du <b>Mariage</b> and Scènes de la Vie Conjugale. These works lacked firsthand knowledge; Saintsbury {{points out that}} [...] "cœlebs cannot talk of [...] with much authority". In late April the newly-weds set off for Paris.

500|$|Viennese {{operetta}} sprang out of {{an attempt}} by Viennese composers to imitate Jacques Offenbach's works, after the highly successful performance of Le <b>mariage</b> aux lanternes at the Carltheater in 1858. Franz von Suppé was the most notable of these early composers, and proved instrumental in defining the new subgenre. Grove Music Online names Suppé's Das Pensionat (1860) as [...] "the first successful attempt at a genuine Viennese operetta", and {{this was followed by}} several more successes, for Suppé, including Flotte Bursche (1863) and Die schöne Galathée (1865). However, until Fatinitza in 1876, Suppé did not write a full-length operetta, and, despite the successes of his shorter works, neither he, nor other Viennese composers such as Giovanni von Zaytz, [...] were able to compete with Offenbach for popularity throughout the 1860s.|$|E
