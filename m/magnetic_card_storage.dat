40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 111) The {{advent of}} pocket calculators with <b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> <b>storage</b> combined with simplified solutions for elliptical-contact deformation, as developed by Brewe, make possible {{the solution of}} engineering problems by calculator formerly requiring large computers. Engineers working with advanced or sophisticated bearing applications often require more detailed design information than that generally made available by bearing manufacturers. This paper develops design equations, in a form suited to the calculator, and programs to solve four situations for angular contact bearings. The four programs presented herein are for (1) axial deflection and stress due to a thrust load, (2) contact angle change due to a thrust load, (3) deflection of a preloaded bearing due to a radial load, (4) ball angular speed and ball-group speed-ratio with centrifugal effects due to high speed. Each program is presented with a derivation of the most essential steps, {{instructions on how to}} use the program, sample printout to aid in reading the output and a listing of the data register contents. There is also a flow diagram for each to aid in understanding and permit program modifications, if desired. Program listings will be found in the appendix. Sample solutions are given which were derived from the programs as presented. These solutions should provide insight as to the capabilities of each program. In addition the sample printout and solutions provide a useful method for checking for proper operation of the programs. The speed-ratio section makes a case, then develops solutions, for non-race-control of the balls by the race. This case is at variance with the modes of inner or outer race control usually found in the literature. The resulting speed-ratio falls roughly between that of the other two modes and it remains to be shown when and in what degree the no control case will be valid...|$|E

HP offered a library of programs supplied on packs of pre-recorded <b>magnetic</b> <b>cards</b> for many applications including surveying, medicine, as well as civil and electrical engineering.|$|R

50|$|In January 2007, Moscow Metro began {{replacing}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>cards</b> with contactless disposable tickets {{based on}} NXP's MIFARE Ultralight technology. Ultralight tickets {{are available for}} a fixed number of trips in 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 60-trip denominations (valid for 5 or 90 days from the day of purchase) and as a monthly ticket, only valid for a selected calendar month and limited to 70 trips. The sale of <b>magnetic</b> <b>cards</b> stopped 16 January 2008 and <b>magnetic</b> <b>cards</b> stopped being accepted in late 2008, making the Moscow metro the world's first major public-transport system to run exclusively on a contact-less automatic fare-collection system.|$|R
50|$|Optional input/output devices {{included}} a card reader and punch, a paper tape reader and punch, and a <b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> reader.

40|$|Existing <b>magnetic</b> <b>cards</b> adopt {{plain text}} to store {{confidential}} information, thus being vulnerable to an untrusted {{credit card reader}} or a skimming device. To tackle the problem, researchers have proposed several new techniques such as integrated circuit card (IC card) and mobile wallet applications; however, none of them can support existing <b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> readers thereby facing backwards compatibility issue. In this paper, to combat such credit card information leakages and remain backwards compatible, we propose SafePay, a system that transforms disposable credit card information to electrical current and drives a <b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> chip to simulate {{the behavior of a}} physical <b>magnetic</b> <b>card.</b> We have implemented a prototype system of SafePay by a mobile phone and a prototype <b>magnetic</b> <b>card</b> chip. In the evaluation, we show that the current cost is about 0. 5 excluding the phone, and the cost can be even lowered if manufactured in large scale. We also evaluated the prototype in experimental environment such as oscilloscope and real-world scenarios such as vending machines. The results show that the physical signal in oscilloscope {{is the same as the}} theoretical value, and meanwhile, we can successfully buy products in all the tested real-world scenarios...|$|R
