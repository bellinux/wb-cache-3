5|$|For {{the first}} two years of the club's existence, the players {{organised}} matches among themselves at Snaresbrook near Epping Forest, probably on a part of Epping Forest between the Infant Orphan Asylum and Forest Place. Forest's first match against another club took place on 15 March 1862, and resulted in a victory over Crystal Palace (not the modern club of the same name). Both this match, and a return fixture between the two teams the following month, involved fifteen players on each team. At the time, the rules of association football had not been codified, and many variants existed, differing in the number of players per team, whether players were permitted to play the ball with their hands, or the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>scoring</b> goals. In 1863 the Forest club was among the founder members of The Football Association (the FA) and adopted the rules set down by that body, although they continued to play occasional matches under other sets of rules against clubs not affiliated to the FA.|$|E
5|$|Safeties are {{the least}} common <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>scoring</b> in American {{football}} but are not rare occurrences– since 1932, a safety has occurred once every 14.31 games in the National Football League (NFL), or {{about once a week}} under current scheduling rules. On October 21, 1973, Fred Dryer, playing for the Los Angeles Rams against the Green Bay Packers, became the only player in NFL History to score two safeties in a single game. A much rarer occurrence is the one-point safety, which can be scored by the offense on an extra point or two-point conversion attempt; those have occurred at least twice in NCAA Division I football since 1996, most recently at the 2013 Fiesta Bowl. No conversion safeties have occurred since at least 1940 in the NFL. A conversion safety by the defense is also possible, though highly unlikely; although this has never occurred, it is the only possible way a team could finish with a single point in an American football game.|$|E

25|$|Seven Tricks Or Higher!: For {{successful}} bids {{of seven}} or more, players get an extra 10 points for each trick bid above six.

25|$|The {{rules of}} the sport had {{continued}} to evolve, and until the 1940s there was no world governing body to oversee this and ensure consistency. Negotiations between the respective governing bodies were required to fix rules {{to be used for}} tours, though generally the other nations took their lead from the British authorities. For example, the field goal was banned by the New South Wales Rugby League in 1922 however this <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>scoring</b> was not officially recognised as being removed from the game until 1950 when the British authorities banned it.|$|E

25|$|A drop goal (now {{also known}} as a field goal) is worth only one point and is thus the least chosen <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>scoring.</b> It is {{attempted}} during general play, and to be valid must be made by a drop kick, and as with penalty and conversion goals, must pass both over the crossbar and between the uprights of the goal-posts. Drop goals are usually attempted when in good field position in an attempt to secure a win late in a close game or when the scores are within a converted try (6 points) of each other so that, if successful, their opponents must score a minimum of two times to avoid losing. Less commonly, drop goals may be attempted just before half-time, to secure the most points scored in the first half. Additionally, it is a common way to win matches in competitions that use golden point extra time to decide games that are tied after normal time has elapsed.|$|E
500|$|On 3 March 1875 the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), in its {{capacity}} as the governing body for rackets and real tennis, convened {{a meeting at}} Lord's Cricket Ground to test the various versions of lawn tennis with the aim to standardise the game's rules. Wingfield was present to demonstrate Sphairistikè, as was John H. Hale, who presented his version called Germains Lawn Tennis; {{there is no record}} of either Gem or Perera being present to showcase Pelota. After the meeting, the MCC Tennis Committee was tasked with framing the rules. On 29 May 1875 the MCC issued the Laws of Lawn Tennis, the first unified rules for lawn tennis, which were adopted by the club on 24 June. These were significantly based on the rules introduced by Wingfield in February 1874 and published in his [...] rule-booklet titled Sphairistikè or Lawn Tennis. The MCC adopted Wingfield's hourglass-shaped court as well as the rackets <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>scoring,</b> in which the player who first scores 15 points wins the game and only the server ("hand-in") was able to score. The height of the net was set at 5ft (1.52m) at the posts and 4ft (1.22m) in the centre. Various aspects of these rules, including the characteristic court shape and the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>scoring,</b> were the subject of prolonged debate in the press. The MCC rules were not universally adhered to following its publication and, among others, the Prince's Club in London stuck to playing on rectangular courts.|$|E
500|$|The French {{masters of}} the method and their imitators in other {{countries}} confined their attention {{for the most part}} to an exploitation of the possibilities afforded by {{the upper reaches of the}} orchestral register, and to the attainment, principally, of effects of brilliance and luminosity. Debussy's writing for the lower instruments, and for the double-bases in particular, is as a general rule timid and conventional in comparison with his treatment of the higher instruments, as a result, doubtless, of his exaggerated fear of thickness of texture. In The Oceanides Sibelius has explored the lower depths of the orchestra more thoroughly than any one had previously done, and applied the impressionist <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>scoring</b> to the bass instruments, thereby achieving effects of sonority hitherto unknown.|$|E

2500|$|Officially, {{the single}} {{is called a}} rouge (French for [...] "red") but is often {{referred}} to as a single. The exact derivation of the term is unknown, but it has been thought that in early Canadian football, the scoring of a single was signalled with a red flag.

2500|$|The {{championship}} {{adopted a}} new <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>scoring</b> points, which was proposed by Somerset. Previously {{the only way}} to score points was by winning a match, but the new method introduced points for draws. A winning team scored five points, a team which drew a match, but scored more runs in the first innings scored three points, and a team which drew a match, but scored less runs in the first innings scored one point. In his editorial in the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, Sydney Pardon notes that had any of the previous scoring methods been used, Kent would have won the championship, rather than Warwickshire. In their book A History of Cricket, Harry Altham and E. W. Swanton describe the Kent team as being [...] "possibly a finer all-round side" [...] than Warwickshire, but heap praise on Warwickshire's batting, and their young captain, Frank Foster.|$|E

40|$|Background: In medical {{education}} grades are often determined {{by combining the}} <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> different assessments. While the psychometric literature recommends that the variance in each assessment be identical, there is limited discussion of the impact <b>of</b> different <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> combining <b>scores.</b> Method: Eight mock assessment results were created and used to develop an overall assessment that consisted of four types of assessments that were undertaken twice in a year. Various <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> combining <b>scores</b> were then used. The methods used two mechanisms for standardising results {{and a number of}} algorithms for combining <b>scores.</b> The impact <b>of</b> using the standard error of measurement was also investigated. Results: The number of ‘students’ failing ranged from five (simple addition of scores/ 8) to 30 (standardisation <b>of</b> <b>scores,</b> add scores/ 8, plus pass each type of assessment). Discussion: There is a large variation in the number of students failing associated with different <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> combining <b>scores.</b> Conclusion: Choosing a method to produce a combined score is a non-trivial exercise. The impact on student progression can be significant and whatever method is chosen will require justification...|$|R

Here, we first propose two <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>scoring</b> verb parses {{to make the system}} deterministic, and then apply the most successful verb scoring method in the analysis of relative clause subordination and coordination. ...|$|R
