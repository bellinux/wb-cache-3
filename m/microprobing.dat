30|$|<b>Microprobes</b> {{are used}} to repair {{neuronal}} injury by recording electrical signals from neuronal cells around {{the surface of the}} device. Following implantation into the brain, the immune response results in formation of scar tissue around the <b>microprobe.</b> However, neurons must be in close proximity to the <b>microprobe</b> to enable signal recording. A common reason for failure of <b>microprobes</b> is impaired signal recording due to scar tissue, which is not related to the <b>microprobe</b> itself. Therefore, the device–cell interface must be improved {{to increase the number of}} neurons in contact with the surface. In this study, we developed nanostructured SU- 8 <b>microprobes</b> to support neuronal growth. Nanostructures of 200  nm diameter and depth were applied to the surface of <b>microprobes,</b> and the attachment and neurite outgrowth of PC 12 cells on the <b>microprobes</b> were evaluated.

40|$|Increased AP {{density in}} {{enterprise}} WLANs leads to increasing RF interference and decreasing performance. An important step towards mitigating {{this problem is}} to construct precise RF maps {{in the form of}} a conflict graph. Prior work on conflict graph construction, mostly using bandwidth tests [17], suffers from two problems: a) It is limited to static settings and cannot support mobility, and b) It incurs significant measurement overhead and must be performed offline (e. g. overnight). An alternative to bandwidth tests is “micro-probing ” [4] that operates on millisecond-level time scales. Micro-probing rapidly constructs the conflict graph even while the network is in use (i. e. online). While interesting in principle, micro-probing has only been evaluated in simulation. In this work, we empirically study <b>microprobing</b> on a 40 -node wireless testbed. In doing so, we not only show that micro-probing is in fact practically realizable, but also present key insights that drive the design choices for our implementation. We benchmark micro-probing against bandwidth tests and find that micro-probing is just as accurate but with up to a 400 times reduction in overhead. Finally, we argue that a successful implementation of <b>microprobing</b> opens up the space for further innovations in realtime WLAN adaptation and optimization. 1...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the continuing research effort towards {{the use of}} ultrasonic silicon-based microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) systems for biomedical applications. Microfabricated silicon-horn based surgical <b>microprobes</b> are developed to reduce penetration force into biological tissues by actuating the surgical tool at its ultrasonic resonance. Silicon serves as an ideal platform for integration {{of a variety of}} microfabricated sensors on the surgical tools to monitor tissue activity. In this thesis, two sensors are integrated on the <b>microprobes</b> namely platinum electrodes and piezoresistive polysilicon strain gauge sensors. The use of these <b>microprobes</b> in biomedical applications is explored including ultrasonically actuated <b>microprobes</b> with platinum electrodes for cardiac signal recording and stimulation, and ultrasonically actuated <b>microprobes</b> with strain sensors for a testicular tubule-size assay and fluid viscosity measurement. The first part of the thesis presents silicon <b>microprobes</b> integrated with hornPZT actuator for reduction in penetration force in cardiac left ventricular tissue. Platinum electrodes integrated on the <b>microprobes</b> measure the action potentials along the ventricular wall. This device can potentially help provide a 3 D map of the electrophysiological activity (wave propagation) in the heart, which may lead to the understanding of cardiac arrhythmias, as well as the prevention and cure of the disease. Also, by ultrasonically stimulating the tissue invasively using the horn with <b>microprobes,</b> the ability to stimulate cardiac tissue and initiate electrophysiological activity in the tissue is demonstrated. The second part of the thesis presents ultrasonic silicon <b>microprobes</b> integrated with strain gauges to monitor the reaction force when inserted into tissue, and its potential for in vitro microscale tissue characterization is demonstrated. A testicular tubule-size assay is demonstrated by monitoring the strain signal output recorded during insertion of the <b>microprobe</b> in rat testis tissue to estimate the average diameter of the seminiferous tubules. This information is important for the surgeon to distinguish between tubules with (larger diameter) and without (smaller diameter) fertile sperm during microdissection-TESE (testicular sperm extraction) surgery, thus enabling a microprobe-based assay for sperm viability. This technique is effectively a new biomedical imaging technique {{that can be used to}} image physical characteristics of tissue non-invasively. This can prove to be an invaluable tool during surgery for intelligent tissue biopsy by identifying specific regions of the tissue that exhibit detectable physical characteristics (stiffness, temperature, etc.). The final part of the thesis presents a silicon horn-based ultrasonic <b>microprobes</b> for fluid viscosity measurement with integrated capacitance-based <b>microprobe</b> immersion depth sensors. The longitudinal and flexural vibrations induced in the <b>microprobes</b> due to the PZT-based ultrasonic actuation of the silicon horn structure is precisely monitored by means of the strain gauge, and its damping when the <b>microprobes</b> are immersed in fluid is used to estimate the fluid viscosity.

Comparison of the results of IR microscopy with aluminum distributions obtained by electron microprobe analysis revealed that IR microscopy cannot resolve inhomogeneities on a scale smaller than the above-stated limits.

40|$|Precise {{methods have}} been {{developed}} to study the optomotor responses of insects in correlation with <b>microprobing</b> and histology. These include stimulus patterns whose noise power is controlled to one part per million and a directly-connected digital computer system that permits the accurate reduction and analysis of responses. A range of flight and head torque reactions was studied for Musca domestica. Patterns producing gross temporal changes or sudden transients were found to elicit more complex reactions than hitherto reported. However, the steady flight torque responses to precision cylindrical patterns of various wavelengths, rotating at precisely constant velocity, provided detailed information on the optical properties of the ommatidia and the motion-detection capabilities of the eye. These studies indicate that the photoreceptors can be characterized by visual fields whose full width to 50 % of effective light flux sensitivity is about 5 degrees in the dark-adapted state. It is, however, about 40 % less in the light-adapted case. Histological investigations show that this is caused by a shielding pigment migration. Correlated temporal changes in acuity can be detected in the optomotor responses with an adaptation period of about 10 min. Detection of constant velocity motion was found to involve the interaction of only a few adjacent ommatidia with total responses given by a simple saturable summation of these unit interactions. This process of parallel summation from many unit areas of the total field provides a very high signal to noise ratio for the nervous system, enabling the insect to detect patterns of quite low intensity and contrast when the wavelength is greater than 15 or 20 degrees. Thresholds for such patterns are about three orders of magnitude below those of light response signals normally detectable by <b>microprobing</b> in the retinular cells. However, the relatively high ratio of ommatidia field to interommatidial spacing results in a rapid increase of threshold with reduced wavelength. The optomotor response threshold for a 3 degrees pattern exceeds that of a 15 degrees pattern by a factor of more than 1000. This is the minimum wavelength detectable with the precision patterns that were used. Many of the apparent reactions reported in other investigations can be attributed to inaccuracies in the stimulus patterns...|$|E

These structures act as multilayer interference reflectors for x-rays, soft x-rays, and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light. Their high reflectivity and moderate energy bandwidth (10 < E/∆E < 100) make them a valuable addition to the range of optical components useful in instrumentation for EUV radiation and x-rays with photon energies from a few hundred eV to tens of keV.

Multilayer reflectors also have a wide range of applications in the EUV region, where normal-incidence multilayer reflectors allow the construction of space telescopes and of optics for EUV lithography. Ordinary mirrors, operating at normal or near-normal angles of incidence, do not work throughout the EUV and x-ray regions.
