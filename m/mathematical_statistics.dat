25|$|Statistical theory studies {{decision}} {{problems such}} as minimizing the risk (expected loss) of a statistical action, such as using a procedure in, for example, parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and selecting the best. In these traditional areas of <b>mathematical</b> <b>statistics,</b> a statistical-decision problem is formulated by minimizing an objective function, like expected loss or cost, under specific constraints: For example, designing a survey often involves minimizing the cost of estimating a population mean with a given level of confidence. Because of its use of optimization, the mathematical theory of statistics shares concerns with other decision sciences, such as operations research, control theory, and mathematical economics.|$|E

25|$|Two main {{statistical}} methods {{are used in}} data analysis: descriptive statistics, which summarize data from a sample using indexes such as the mean or standard deviation, and inferential statistics, which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation (e.g., observational errors, sampling variation). Descriptive statistics are most often concerned with two sets of properties of a distribution (sample or population): central tendency (or location) seeks to characterize the distribution's central or typical value, while dispersion (or variability) characterizes {{the extent to which}} members of the distribution depart from its center and each other. Inferences on <b>mathematical</b> <b>statistics</b> are made under the framework of probability theory, which deals with the analysis of random phenomena.|$|E

Joining full-time in October 1950 until January 1951, he was a visiting professor, assuming Koopman's classes in the Department of Economics, and led the commission's research on theory of resource allocation. He was also a research professor of economics and <b>mathematical</b> <b>statistics</b> at the University of Illinois, a consultant to the RAND Corporation through the University of Chicago and a consultant to the U.S. Bureau of the Budget.

25|$|When he {{approached}} Pearson and the English university system, Georgescu was amazed with the informality and openness he found. There {{was no more}} feeling like a métèque, a stranger. Studying with Pearson {{for the next two}} years and reading Pearson's work on the philosophy of science, titled The Grammar of Science, further shaped Georgescu's scientific methodology and philosophy. The two men even made a friendship, and Pearson encouraged Georgescu to carry on with his studies in <b>mathematical</b> <b>statistics.</b> They co-pioneered research on the so-called 'problem of moments', one of the most difficult topics in statistics at the time, but neither of them were able to solve the problem. This was a great disappointment to Pearson, but Georgescu was pleased about experiencing their joint effort nonetheless.|$|E
25|$|In <b>mathematical</b> <b>statistics,</b> Haar {{measures}} {{are used for}} prior measures, which are prior probabilities for compact groups of transformations. These prior {{measures are}} used to construct admissible procedures, by appeal to the characterization of admissible procedures as Bayesian procedures (or limits of Bayesian procedures) by Wald. For example, a right Haar measure {{for a family of}} distributions with a location parameter results in the Pitman estimator, which is best equivariant. When left and right Haar measures differ, the right measure is usually preferred as a prior distribution. For the group of affine transformations on the parameter space of the normal distribution, the right Haar measure is the Jeffreys prior measure. Unfortunately, even right Haar measures sometimes result in useless priors, which cannot be recommended for practical use, like other methods of constructing prior measures that avoid subjective information.|$|E
25|$|In <b>mathematical</b> <b>statistics,</b> the Kullback–Leibler {{divergence}} (also called relative entropy) is {{a measure}} of how one probability distribution diverges from a second, expected probability distribution. Applications include characterizing the relative (Shannon) entropy in information systems, randomness in continuous time-series, and information gain when comparing statistical models of inference. In contrast to variation of information, it is a distribution-wise asymmetric measure and thus does not qualify as a statistical metric of spread. In the simple case, a Kullback–Leibler divergence of 0 indicates that we can expect similar, if not the same, behavior of two different distributions, while a Kullback–Leibler divergence of 1 indicates that the two distributions behave in such a different manner that the expectation given the first distribution approaches zero. In simplified terms, it {{is a measure}} of surprise, with diverse applications such as applied statistics, fluid mechanics, neuroscience and machine learning.|$|E
