5|$|The combat took around {{fifteen minutes}} and left forty royalists dead and many injured, {{including}} Zabala. Fourteen patriot grenadiers {{died in the}} combat and two <b>more</b> <b>would</b> die afterwards due to combat injuries. Manuel Díaz Vélez fell from his horse in the gully, was mortally injured and captured by the royalists. Bermúdez {{was shot in the}} patella and died a few days later. Hipólito Bouchard captured the Spanish flag after killing the standard bearer.|$|E
5|$|The filmography of English actor Robert Bathurst {{comprises}} both {{film and}} television roles spanning almost 30 years. Bathurst made his acting debut for television in 1982 in the never-broadcast pilot episode for the BBC sitcom Blackadder, though his character Prince Henry was recast when the Black Adder series was commissioned. Throughout {{the rest of the}} 1980s, Bathurst appeared in episodes of The Lenny Henry Show, Who Dares Wins, The District Nurse, Red Dwarf, and Chelmsford 123, before starring alongside his Cambridge Footlights colleague Stephen Fry in the short-run series Anything <b>More</b> <b>Would</b> Be Greedy. He also appeared in the films Whoops Apocalypse (1986) and Just Ask for Diamond (1988).|$|E

In the {{following}} 24 hours, over 2000 people were treated in city hospitals for injuries sustained in the rush to be near Evita as her body was being transported, and thousands <b>more</b> <b>would</b> be treated on the spot. For the following two weeks, lines would stretch for many city blocks with mourners waiting hours to see Evita's body lie at the Ministry of Labour.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{drafting}} a new charter for Manila in June 1901, the Americans made official what {{had long been}} tacit: that the city of Manila consisted not of Intramuros alone {{but also of the}} surrounding areas. The new charter proclaimed that Manila was composed of eleven municipal districts: presumably Binondo, Ermita, Intramuros, Malate, Paco, Pandacan, Sampaloc, San Miguel, Santa Ana, Santa Cruz and Tondo. In addition, the Catholic Church recognized five parishes—Gagalangin, Trozo, Balic-Balic, Santa Mesa and Singalong—as part of Manila. Later, two <b>more</b> <b>would</b> be added: Balut and San Andres.|$|E
5|$|He {{continued}} to make minor appearances in television throughout the 1980s; in 1987, he auditioned {{for the role of}} Dave Lister in the BBC North science fiction sitcom Red Dwarf. The part eventually went to Craig Charles but Bathurst was given a role in the first episode of the first series as Frank Todhunter, second officer on the ship, who is killed in the first ten minutes. Ten years later, Bathurst was invited to reprise the role when a storyline in the series allowed former characters to return, but filming commitments prevented him from appearing. In 1989, he appeared in Malcolm Bradbury's Anything <b>More</b> <b>Would</b> Be Greedy for Anglia Television, playing Dennis Medlam, MP. The programme was broadcast in 1990 to little fanfare. In 1990, he performed on Up Yer News, a live topical programme broadcast on BSB.|$|E
5|$|In 1552 Mercator {{moved from}} Leuven to Duisburg in the Duchy of Cleves. He never gave {{his reasons for}} the move but several factors may have been involved: not having been born in Brabant he could never be a full citizen of Leuven; Catholic {{intolerance}} of religious dissidents in the Low Countries was becoming ever more aggressive and a man suspected of heresy once would never be trusted; the Erasmian constitution and the religious tolerance of Cleves must have appeared attractive; {{there was to be}} a new university in Duisburg and teachers would be required. He was not alone; over the years to come many <b>more</b> <b>would</b> flee from the oppressive Catholicism of Brabant and Flanders to tolerant cities such as Duisburg.|$|E

5|$|Many {{thousands}} of troops from all the countries involved were drafted to the area, and disease broke out almost immediately. Hundreds perished, mostly from cholera. Hundreds <b>more</b> <b>would</b> die waiting to be shipped out, or on the voyage. Their prospects were little better {{when they arrived at}} the poorly staffed, unsanitary and overcrowded hospitals which were the only medical provision for the wounded. In Britain, a trenchant letter in The Times on 14 October triggered Sidney Herbert, Secretary of State for War, to approach Florence Nightingale to form a detachment of nurses to be sent to the hospital to save lives. Interviews were quickly held, suitable candidates selected, and Nightingale left for Turkey on 21 October.|$|E
5|$|McGill University {{played a}} {{meaningful}} {{role in the}} Great War. Many students and alumni enlisted in {{the first wave of}} patriotic fervor that swept the nation in 1914, but in the spring of 1915 — after the first wave of heavy Canadian casualties at Ypres — Hamilton Gault, the founder of the Canadian regiment and a wealthy Montreal businessman, was faced with a desperate shortage of troops. When he reached out to his friends at home for support, over two hundred were commissioned from the ranks, and many <b>more</b> <b>would</b> serve as soldiers throughout the war. On their return to Canada after the war, Major George McDonald and Major George Currie formed the accounting firm McDonald Currie, which later became {{one of the founders of}} Price Waterhouse Coopers. Captain Percival Molson was killed in action in July 1917. Percival Molson Memorial Stadium at McGill is named in his honour.|$|E
5|$|On 6 April 1917, the United States {{declared}} war on Germany, entering World War I. Missouri was recommissioned on 23 April for service as a training ship for gunners and engine room personnel, based in the Chesapeake Bay. Rear Admiral Hugh Rodman hoisted his flag aboard Missouri on 26 August, as {{the commander of the}} 2nd Division, Atlantic Fleet. On 11 November 1918, Germany signed the Armistice that ended the war. Missouri was subsequently used to ferry American soldiers back from Europe as part of the Cruiser and Transport Force. Her first voyage began on 15 February 1919 when she steamed out of Norfolk; three <b>more</b> <b>would</b> follow that year. In the course of the four trips, she carried 3,278 soldiers back to the United States. The old battleship was decommissioned for the last time on 8 September 1919 at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. Missouri was sold to J. G. Hitner and W. F. Cutler of Philadelphia on 26 January 1922 and subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E

5|$|The {{regiment}} fielded {{at least}} 49 battalions during the First World War, from a pre-war establishment of two regular, two militia, and six territorial. Of those battalions, 26 served abroad, receiving 58 battle honours and six Victoria Crosses for {{service on the}} Western Front, the Balkans, India, and Russia. Some 13,795 Kingsmen died {{during the course of}} the war, the battalions suffering an average of 615 deaths. Thousands <b>more</b> <b>would</b> be wounded, sick, or taken prisoner. Of specific formations, the four Liverpool Pals battalions had nearly 2,800 casualties, while the 55th (West Lancashire) Division's 165th (Liverpool) Brigade, composed entirely of battalions from the King's, incurred 1,672 dead, 6,056 wounded, and 953 missing during the period of 3 January 1916 and 11 November 1918.|$|E
5|$|Wada had {{stated in}} 2006, while the {{development}} and release of Compilation titles was still ongoing, that the Compilation could remain an active franchise until 2017, the twentieth anniversary of Final Fantasy VIIs release. After finishing work on Advent Children Complete, the team announced that they would {{take a break from}} the series, although they stated that they still have various ideas for future titles. In later interviews relating to Final Fantasy VII, multiple staff members including Nomura stated that the Compilation was only ever intended to extend to three games and a movie, ending with the release of Crisis Core. Their reasoning was that releasing any <b>more</b> <b>would</b> saturate the market.|$|E
5|$|While the {{scientists}} argued over classifications and nomenclature, they also returned west for more fossils. Marsh made his last trip backed by Yale in 1873, {{with a large}} group of thirteen students accompanying him, protected by a group of soldiers who wanted to make a show of force to the Sioux tribe. Due to concerns over his more lavish and expensive expeditions in years past, Marsh had the students pay their own way, and the trip cost Yale only $1857.50, far less than the $15,000 (over $200,000 in modern currency) that Marsh had claimed for the previous expedition. This excursion would prove to be Marsh's last: {{for the rest of the}} Bone Wars, Marsh preferred to enlist the services of local collectors. Though he had enough bones to study for years, the scientist's appetite for <b>more</b> <b>would</b> grow. Cope was even more prolific in his collecting that season than he was in 1872, although Marsh's penchant for cultivating collectors of his own meant that at Bridger his rival was persona non grata. Tired of working under Hayden, Cope found a paying job with the Army Corps of Engineers, but was limited by this federal association; while Cope had to tag along on surveys, Marsh could collect wherever he pleased.|$|E
