5|$|Globular {{clusters}} have a {{very high}} star density, and therefore close interactions and near-collisions of stars occur relatively often. Due to these chance encounters, some exotic classes of stars, such as blue stragglers, millisecond pulsars and low-mass X-ray binaries, are <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in globular clusters. A blue straggler is formed from the merger of two stars, possibly {{as a result of an}} encounter with a binary system. The resulting star has a higher temperature than comparable stars in the cluster with the same luminosity, and thus differs from the main sequence stars formed at the beginning of the cluster.|$|E
5|$|Hashimoto's {{thyroiditis}} is an autoimmune {{disorder in}} which the thyroid gland is infltrated by the lymphocytes B-cell and T-cells. These progressively destroy the thyroid gland. In this way, Hasimoto's thyroiditis may have occurred insidiously, and only be noticed when thyroid hormone production decreases, causing symptoms of hypothyroidism. Hashimoto's {{is more common in}} females than males, <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> after the age of 60, and has known genetic risk factors. Also more common in individuals with Hashimoto's thyroiditis are type 1 diabetes, pernicious anaemia, Addison's disease vitiligo.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that, during the Solar System's formation, Mars was created {{as the result}} of a {{stochastic}} process of run-away accretion of material from the protoplanetary disk that orbited the Sun. Mars has many distinctive chemical features caused by its position in the Solar System. Elements with comparatively low boiling points, such as chlorine, phosphorus, and sulphur, are <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> on Mars than Earth; these elements were probably pushed outward by the young Sun's energetic solar wind.|$|E

5|$|Nitrogen has two stable isotopes: 14N and 15N. The {{first is}} <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>common,</b> making up 99.634% of natural nitrogen, {{and the second}} (which is {{slightly}} heavier) makes up the remaining 0.366%. This leads to an atomic weight of around 14.007u. Both of these stable isotopes are produced in the CNO cycle in stars, but 14N is more common as its neutron capture is the rate-limiting step. 14N {{is one of the}} five stable odd–odd nuclides (a nuclide having an odd number of protons and neutrons); the other four are 2H, 6Li, 10B, and 180mTa.|$|E
5|$|San Diego's roadway system {{provides}} an extensive network of cycle routes. Its dry and mild climate makes cycling a convenient year-round option; however, the city's hilly terrain and long average trip distances make cycling less practicable. Older and denser neighborhoods around the downtown {{tend to be}} utility cycling oriented. This is {{partly because of the}} grid street patterns now absent in newer developments farther from the urban core, where suburban style arterial roads are <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>common.</b> As a result, a majority of cycling is recreational. In 2006, San Diego was rated the best city (with a population over 1 million) for cycling in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{commercially viable}} ore of lutetium is the rare-earth phosphate mineral monazite, (Ce,La,etc.)PO4, which contains 0.003% of the element. The main mining areas are China, United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia. Pure lutetium metal {{is one of}} the rarest and most expensive of the rare-earth metals with the price about 10,000 USD/kg, or about one-fourth that of gold. Lanthanum is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>common,</b> being the second most abundant rare earth, and in addition to monazite can also be extracted economically from bastnäsite.|$|E
50|$|This {{philosophy}} {{serves as}} a meeting of two opposing schools of Hindu philosophy, pure monism (God and the soul as one entity) and pure dualism (God and the soul as absolutely separate). In practice Gaudiya Vaishnava philosophy has <b>much</b> <b>more</b> in <b>common</b> with the dualistic schools, as Krishna is worshiped as a Supreme person.|$|R

5|$|Aonchotheca forresteri is a {{parasitic}} nematode that infects {{the marsh}} rice rat (Oryzomys palustris) in Florida. Occurring mainly in adults, it inhabits the stomach. It is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> during the wet season, perhaps because its unknown intermediate host is an earthworm that only emerges when it rains. The worm {{was discovered in}} 1970 and formally described in 1987. Originally classified in the genus Capillaria, it was reclassified in Aonchotheca in 1999. A.forresteri is small and narrow-bodied, with a length of 13.8 to 19.4mm in females and 6.8 to 9.2mm in males. Similar species such as A.putorii differ in features of the alae and spicule (organs in the male), {{the size of the}} female, and the texture of the eggs.|$|E
5|$|Architectural {{historians have}} grouped the Precious Blood-related churches of far western Ohio into four {{different}} generations: the first, composed primarily of small log buildings {{from the first}} years of settlement until 1865; the second, composed of moderately sized brick churches built between 1865 and 1885; the third, composed mostly of large High Gothic Revival churches with massive towers constructed from 1885 to 1905; and the fourth, composed of churches built between 1905 and 1925 {{in a wide range of}} styles. Immaculate Conception's place at the end of the third generation is significant: its Romanesque Revival style is atypical of that period and <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in the fourth generation that would soon arise, putting it in somewhat of a transitional place between the third and fourth generations.|$|E
5|$|Chrysolina graminis and C. herbacea {{are similar}} in size and colour and may be {{confused}} in UK populations. Distinguishing the two species in the United Kingdom is particularly important as C. graminis is a vulnerable species whereas C. herbacea is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>common.</b> This has previously led to the misidentification of C. herbacea as C. graminis. C. herbacea measures 7–11mm in length. It is coloured iridescent green on dorsal surface throughout. The punctuation on the pronotum and elytra is distinctly similar, unlike in C. graminis. There is a smooth lip running only half {{the length of the}} ventral edge of the elytra, whereas this lip runs the full length on C. graminis.|$|E
