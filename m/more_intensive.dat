5|$|Ploughshare, triangular-shaped: Triangular-shaped stone ploughshares {{are found}} at the sites of Majiabang culture dated to 3500 BC around Lake Tai. Ploughshares have also been {{discovered}} at the nearby Liangzhu and Maqiao sites roughly dated to the same period. David R. Harris says this indicates that <b>more</b> <b>intensive</b> cultivation in fixed, probably bunded, fields had developed by this time. According to Mu Yongkang and Song Zhaolin's classification and methods of use, the triangular plough assumed many kinds and were the departure from the Hemudu and Luojiajiao spade, with the Songze small plough in mid-process. The post-Liangzhu ploughs used draft animals.|$|E

5|$|The park {{is located}} on the Cumberland Plateau, atop Lookout Mountain. On the summit of Lookout Mountain, the waters of Daniel Creek and Bear Creek cut gorges through the rock, {{converging}} to form Sitton Gulch Creek. The flat-topped mountains of the Cumberland Plateau are significantly different from the narrow Armuchee ridges beyond nearby Chickamauga Valley to the east. From a geological standpoint, Lookout Mountain is transitional between the flat-lying sedimentary beds of central Tennessee, and the ridges and valley to the east, which display <b>more</b> <b>intensive</b> folding and faulting. Most of the canyon's rock formations consist of sandstone; shale layers below the sandstone are marked by pine trees.|$|E

5|$|The {{trend towards}} <b>more</b> <b>intensive</b> farming {{began to be}} {{partially}} reversed {{by the end of}} the century as more environmentally friendly practices were encouraged by government and European Union grants. For example, Richard Zawadzki, owner of Balfour Mains (the largest farm on the island), ceased to breed livestock (instead keeping animals bred elsewhere) and grew less grain (some barley is still grown on the farm). Instead, some of the land is now managed under a Habitat Creation Scheme, which aims to encourage natural vegetation, wild flowers and nesting birds by limiting grazing and reducing the use of chemical fertilisers.|$|E

The Aircraft Synthetic Training Aids (ASTA) provided by Thales Training & Simulation was an electronic training suite to allow the training of crew members to transfer from active MRA4 aircraft to ground-based training systems; this change was made to increase the availability of the aircraft for operational missions and allow for <b>more</b> <b>intensive</b> training exercises.|$|E
5|$|After much persuasion, he overcame {{his fear}} and {{eventually}} made three trips to Singapore to restore his murals in December 1963, July 1982 and May 1988. The 1982 restoration was <b>more</b> <b>intensive</b> and the invaluable assistance given to Warren by {{the officers and}} boys of the SAF Boys' School enabled {{the bulk of the}} work to be completed. Of the original five murals, only one was not fully restored; the mural of St Luke in Prison. Stanley's original tracing of the drawing was missing, and he could not remember the details of the missing portion. In 1985, Stanley's original drawing was discovered in the memorabilia of Wally Hammond who had been a fellow prisoner with Stanley. These original sketches were subsequently donated to the National Archives of Singapore. From the original, Stanley painted a small picture, which was placed below the remaining piece of the mural in 1988. He was, by then, not fit enough to restore the actual mural.|$|E

40|$|Many have {{theorized that}} the {{productivity}} of human capital increases with city size. If this were true, one would expect production in large cities to be <b>more</b> skill <b>intensive</b> than in small cities, even within industry. This paper uses data on the occupational mix at establishments to test whether skill intensity is greater in large cities. Establishments in metropolitan areas with population above two million use a <b>more</b> skill <b>intensive</b> mix of workers than comparable establishments in metropolitan areas with population below one million. The differences in skill intensity {{are not the same}} in all industries; establishments in relatively skill intensive industries are even <b>more</b> skill <b>intensive</b> in large MSAs.

40|$|Employment {{generation}} is a main objective of {{a developing country}} 2 ̆ 7 s industrialisation policy. The realisation of this objective depends largely {{on the nature of}} factor intensity in its manufacturing industry. This has generated a considerable amount of academic discussion on the determinants of factor intensity. However, most of these studies have arrived at differing conclusions, creating a necessity for more extensive empirical investigation into a wider range of developing country situations. This paper presents results from an analysis of factor intensity in the Sri Lankan manufacturing industry. The results indicate that large firms tend to be <b>more</b> capital <b>intensive</b> than small firms. There is also evidence that locally owned firms are <b>more</b> labour <b>intensive</b> than foreign owned firms, Further, high-wage firms seem to use relatively <b>more</b> capital <b>intensive</b> production techniques than low-wage firms...|$|R
5|$|Even at {{the start}} of the Middle Ages the English {{landscape}} had been shaped by human occupation over many centuries. Much woodland was new, the result of fields being reclaimed by brush after the collapse of the Roman Empire. Human intervention had established wood pastures, an ancient system for managing woods and animals, and coppicing, a <b>more</b> <b>intensive</b> approach to managing woodlands. Other agricultural lands included arable fields and pastorage, while in some parts of the country, such as the South-West, waste moorland remained testament to earlier over-farming in the Bronze Age. England's environment continued to be shaped throughout the period, through the building of dykes to drain marshes, tree clearance and the large-scale extraction of peat. Managed parks for hunting game, including deer and boars, were built as status symbols by the nobility from the 12th century onwards, but earlier versions of parks, such as hays, may have originated as early as the 7th century.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 {{a private}} {{security}} guard {{with a pistol}} pursued on foot two men whom he believed tried to steal scrap metal. The men climbed on a railway embankment and started throwing rocks down at the guard who thereafter shot ten rounds in their direction, mortally wounding {{one of them in}} the head. The guard was first convicted of murder by the Municipal Court in Prague and given a sentence of 7 years imprisonment. The decision was changed by the High Court in Prague to conviction of intentional infliction of bodily harm resulting in death (i.e. manslaughter) and a sentence of five years imprisonment. The guard was finally exonerated by the Supreme Court in Brno which considered his action legitimate self-defense, noting that defense must be clearly <b>more</b> <b>intensive</b> than attack in order to be successful, and that the stones and bricks being thrown presented grave danger to the man's life.|$|E
5|$|The Orion {{journeyed to}} its {{destination}} {{as part of}} a convoy of liners by way of Fremantle, Colombo, and Aden before it arrived at Tewfik, Egypt, where the battalion disembarked on 13 February 1940. After a train ride to Cairo, the battalion arrived at what would the main base in the Middle East for the 2NZEF, Maadi Camp, in mid-February. At Maadi, the battalion undertook further training. Following Italy's entry into the war in June, it moved to a newly established defensive position, the Baggush Box, to perform garrison duty. It remained there for the next several months, conducting regular patrols and working on the improvement of the defensive positions. During this time, the battalion suffered its first casualties of the war, although non-fatal, as a result of Italian air raids. By January 1941, the defensive work was completed and the battalion moved to Helwan Camp, near Cairo, for re-equipping and <b>more</b> <b>intensive</b> and large scale training.|$|E

We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for local indeterminacy and multiplicity of the balanced growth path in terms of the factor intensities in both sectors. The balanced growth path is unique if the consumption goods sector is <b>more</b> capital <b>intensive.</b> It may be indeterminate un-der certain conditions. When the investment good sector is <b>more</b> capital <b>intensive</b> a sufficient condition for indeterminacy is that there exist at least three balanced growth paths.

Second, a permanent increase in untied aid raises welfare if the non-traded good is <b>more</b> capital <b>intensive</b> than the operating traded good; otherwise, it may raise or lower welfare. ...|$|R
5|$|Under the Kingdom of Madagascar, {{plantations}} {{were established}} {{for the production of}} crops exported to foreign markets such as England and France. Cloves were imported and planted in 1803, and coconuts—which had been relatively sparse on the island—were cultivated on plantations for the production of oil. Similarly, coffee had been grown on family plots of four to five trees until the early 19thcentury, when <b>more</b> <b>intensive</b> cultivation for export began. Vanilla, later to become one of Madagascar's premiere export crops, was introduced by French entrepreneurs in 1840 and planted in eastern coastal rainforests. The technique of hand pollination, critical to higher vanilla yields, was introduced 30years later. Nonetheless, vanilla remained a marginal crop {{until the end of the}} monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide, more {{chickens}} {{are kept}} {{than any other}} type of poultry, with over 50 billion birds being raised each year as a source of meat and eggs. Traditionally, such birds would have been kept extensively in small flocks, foraging during the day and housed at night. This is still the case in developing countries, where the women often make important contributions to family livelihoods through keeping poultry. However, rising world populations and urbanization have led to the bulk of production being in larger, <b>more</b> <b>intensive</b> specialist units. These are often situated close to where the feed is grown or near to where the meat is needed, and result in cheap, safe food being made available for urban communities. Profitability of production depends very much on the price of feed, which has been rising. High feed costs could limit further development of poultry production.|$|E
5|$|A varsity {{baseball}} team is an established part {{of physical education}} departments at most high schools and colleges in the United States. In 2008, {{nearly half a million}} high schoolers and over 35,000 collegians played on their schools' {{baseball team}}s. The number of Americans participating in baseball has declined since the late 1980s, falling well behind the number of soccer participants. By early in the 20th century, intercollegiate baseball was Japan's leading sport. Today, high school baseball in particular is immensely popular there. The final rounds of the two annual tournaments—the National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament in the spring, and the even more important National High School Baseball Championship in the summer—are broadcast around the country. The tournaments are known, respectively, as Spring Koshien and Summer Koshien after the 55,000-capacity stadium where they are played. In Cuba, baseball is a mandatory part of the state system of physical education, which begins at age six. Talented children as young as seven are sent to special district schools for <b>more</b> <b>intensive</b> training—the first step on a ladder whose acme is the national baseball team.|$|E

5|$|As {{the date}} of the {{operation}} approached, training became <b>more</b> <b>intensive.</b> Glider units spent hours aloft every day circling over airfields as they practiced the manoeuvers required to land the airborne forces next to the bridges over the Orne River, the Caen canal, the Dives, and the Merville battery. Once the pilots had practiced this sufficiently during the day, they were then switched to night operations. In the landing grounds used by the division for their operations, dozens of poles similar to those in Normandy were erected, with engineering units then timed on how fast they could demolish the obstacles. The battalion assigned to neutralising Merville spent two weeks at a special camp, where they built a replica of the battery and carried out several rehearsal exercises in and around it. The force assigned to the coup-de-main operation, to capture the bridges over the Orne River and Caen canal, were transferred to Exeter. There, they conducted intensive exercises around the River Exe and the nearby canal that stood in place for their real objective. The pilots of the gliders and transport aircraft were also constantly briefed with thousands of maps and photographs of the landing zones and the surrounding areas, as well as dozens of scale models of the zones and the primary objectives, such as the bridges and the Merville battery. A coloured film was produced from aerial reconnaissance photographs which, when played at the correct speed and height over the scale models, realistically simulated the paths the glider pilots would take towards their landing-zones.|$|E
5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century Scottish {{agriculture}} became susceptible to {{the ups and downs}} of world markets. There were dramatic price rises in the First World War, but a slump in the 1920s and 1930s, in which perhaps 40 per cent of Scottish land changed hands, followed by more price rises in the Second World War. In 1947 annual price reviews were introduced in an attempt to stabilise the market. A series of Acts of Parliament followed, designed to give price support and grants to farmers. After the Second World War and the associated rationing, there was a drive in UK agriculture to greater production. This lasted until the late 1970s, resulting in <b>more</b> <b>intensive</b> farming. More areas of marginal land were brought into production with government subsidies. At the same time, the amount of forest was increased by a factor of three. There was increasing mechanisation of Scottish agriculture. The horse was replaced by the tractor and the combine harvester. This meant that farming became less labour-intensive. In 1951, 88,000 people worked in Scottish agriculture full-time, but by 1991 it had fallen to about 25,000, leading to more depopulation of rural areas. This helped make Scottish agriculture among the most efficient in Europe.|$|E

Despite the effort by the government, 2,500 people from Pa Thiew and Tha Sae demonstrated for additional and <b>more</b> <b>intensive</b> aid on 9 November. These protests were soon dispersed. Following considerable criticism for downplaying {{the impact of the}} typhoon, Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan delayed his visit to the United States to oversee relief efforts. By 15 November the United States pledged to donate US$25,000 for recovery operations. Telephone connection was restored from Bangkok to Prachuap Khiri Khan by this time; however, areas further south remained disconnected. Generators were brought in to keep hospitals and government offices running since much of Chumphon Province remained without electricity for more than two weeks. As the scale of damage became more apparent, a request for international aid was made by 17 November to the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization. Upon the announcement of the request, six countries pledged to provide nearly US$510,000 in funds collectively. Agriculture across Surat Thani Province was severely affected by the typhoon in the long-term as well. In the four years following Typhoon Gay, land use for orchards, rubber, and oil palm plantations decreased from 33.32percent to 30.53percent. Additionally, rice paddy coverage decreased from 22.96percent to 13.03percent.|$|E
