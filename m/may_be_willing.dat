5|$|Patients {{and their}} guardians must be apprised of any serious risks {{and the common}} side effects of pain treatments. What {{appears to be an}} {{obviously}} acceptable risk or harm to a professional may be unacceptable to the person who has to undertake that risk or experience the side effect. For instance, people who experience pain on movement <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to forgo strong opioids in order to enjoy alertness during their painless periods, whereas others would choose around-the-clock sedation so as to remain pain-free. The care provider should not insist on treatment that someone rejects, and must not provide treatment that the provider believes is more harmful or riskier than the possible benefits can justify.|$|E
5|$|The MAW {{has been}} criticised by workers' and welfare groups for making FDWs second-class citizens. The {{statutory}} minimum wage {{does not apply to}} them; although the MAW is HK$3,920, a local worker working a 48-hour week would earn HK$6,240 if paid at the minimum hourly wage of HK$30 (as of 30 March 2015). The International Domestic Workers Federation has complained that the MAW rose by only 3.9 percent (or HK$150) from 1998 to 2012, failing to keep pace with Hong Kong's median monthly income (which rose over 15 percent during the same period). Since Hong Kong is a benchmark market for Asian migrant workers, there is pressure to keep wages low. Wages were also held in check by competition from Indonesian workers, who began arriving in large numbers during the 1990s. Since then, workers from other Asian countries (such as Bangladesh and Nepal) <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to work for less than the MAW.|$|E

25|$|Very short headways are controversial. The UK Railway Inspectorate has {{evaluated}} the ULTra design {{and is willing}} to accept one-second headways, pending successful completion of initial operational tests at more than 2 seconds. In other jurisdictions, existing rail regulations apply to PRT systems (see CVS, above); these typically calculate headways in terms of absolute stopping distances, which would restrict capacity and make PRT systems unfeasible. No regulatory agency has yet endorsed headways below one second, although proponents believe that regulators <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to reduce headways as operational experience increases.|$|E
25|$|The way the {{individual}} {{rights of a}} family member versus {{the rights of the}} family as a unit are balanced vary significantly in different societies. This may influence {{the degree to which a}} government <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to investigate family incidents. In some cultures, individual members of the family are expected to sacrifice almost completely their own interests in favor of the interests of the family as a whole. What is viewed as an undue expression of personal autonomy is condemned as unacceptable. In these cultures the family predominates over {{the individual}}, and where this interacts with cultures of honor, individualistic choice that may damage the family reputation in the community may result in extreme punishment, such as honor killings.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{medicine}} {{may include}} formalized aspects of folk medicine, {{that is to}} say longstanding remedies passed on and practised by lay people. Folk medicine consists of the healing practices and ideas of body physiology and health preservation known to some in a culture, transmitted informally as general knowledge, and practiced or applied by anyone in the culture having prior experience. Folk medicine may also be referred to as traditional medicine, alternative medicine, indigenous medicine, or natural medicine. These terms are often considered interchangeable, even though some authors may prefer one or the other because of certain overtones they <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to highlight. In fact, out of these terms perhaps only indigenous medicine and traditional medicine have the same meaning as folk medicine, while the others should be understood rather in a modern or modernized context.|$|E

25|$|German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier {{met with}} Uzbek Foreign Minister Vladimir Norov in March 2007.

Steinmeier visited Uzbekistan again from 6–9 April to further assess the effects of the economic sanctions and how to proceed. Uzbek Foreign Minister Vladimir Norov stressed the need to respect Uzbekistan's sovereignty when an EU delegation met with officials from Central Asian governments in Astana, Kazakhstan on 27–28 March. Pierre Morel, the European Union's special representative to Central Asia, said continuing negotiations would be positive.|$|E
500|$|... "Although {{the right}} of silence, in {{contrast}} to the right to counsel, can be exercised passively (by not speaking), a suspect’s initial reticence does not inherently convey to a reasonable police officer that the suspect wishes to exercise a right to silence and terminate the interview. A suspect may want to listen to a recitation of the evidence against him or learn about the benefits of cooperation before deciding whether to exercise his rights. Or a suspect may be formulating an explanation of events that lessens his culpability, planning an alibi, or thinking through his options. Or he <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to talk about some topics but not others ... Simply presuming an invocation after some initial period of silence ... would override the wishes of those suspects who wanted to listen and deliberate further, rather than to end questioning. ...

2500|$|The next week, in episodes {{broadcast}} from 9 to 13 July 2012, Jack and Max both witness Kat dancing sexily with Ray, {{and they are}} judgemental of her, which Inside Soap said could be because {{one of them is}} jealous, and Jack keeps [...] "making eyes" [...] at Kat, which could be more revealing than Kat's own actions. They later said that Kat would probably not dance with Ray like that if she was trying to keep an affair with him secret, especially in front of Kim, and said she could have been trying to make either Max or Jack jealous. All About Soap also thought Jack might be jealous, and when he asks Ray if any [...] "hot women" [...] are going to his party, Jack looks at Kat, which they thought could be because Jack hopes Kat will be there. The [...] "sexy dance" [...] between Ray and Kat was interpreted to be either evidence or a red herring, but Inside Soap noted that Kat seems keen to be around Ray. The fact she dances so close to Ray in front of Kim could mean Ray is not her secret lover, but she enjoys danger so <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to make a show of herself despite the risk. Kat also tells Kim she is [...] "lucky to have found her prince", which All About Soap thought might mean Kat is jealous, and made him their favourite suspect of the fortnight.|$|E
