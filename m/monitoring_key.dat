50|$|ECAM is {{actually}} a series of systems designed to work in unison to display information to the pilots in a quick and effective manner. Sensors placed throughout the aircraft, <b>monitoring</b> <b>key</b> parameters, feed their data into two System Data Acquisition Concentrator (SDACs) which in turn process the data and feed it to two Flight Warning Computers (FWCs). The FWCs check for discrepancies in the data and then display the data on the ECAM displays through the three Display Management Computers (DMCs). In {{the event of a}} fault the FWCs generate the appropriate warning messages and sounds. More vital systems are routed directly through the FWCs such that failures in them can still be detected even with the loss of both SDACs. The whole system can continue to operate even with a failure of one SDAC and one FWC.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{numerous}} research {{studies in the}} automotive sector that aim at providing a more advanced monitoring functionality for <b>monitoring</b> <b>key</b> vehicle components, such as vehicle batteries, vehicle alternators, and internal combustion engines.

[...] Electric vehicle and battery health monitoring and prognostic work has also seen an increasing level of research and development. Algorithms for estimating the electric vehicles battery state of charge and state of health have been successfully demonstrated in several research studies. [...] A more challenging problem is predicting the remaining driving range for an electric vehicle, since this depends on not just the battery state of charge, but also environmental factors, the road and traffic conditions, driving behavior, among other factors.|$|E

40|$|There {{is a need}} {{to address}} the {{significant}} gap in our ability to measure and <b>monitor</b> the <b>Key</b> Performance Indicators (KPIs) across service networks. The unprecedented growth in service-based business processes over {{a short period of time}} has underscored the need for understanding the mechanisms and theorising the business models and business process management adopted across many organisations today. This research presents a survey of the literature and argues that the inability of current Business Process Management (BPM) techniques to visualise and monitor web-enabled business processes prevents us from transforming information on network activity and infrastructures. This inhibits managers in anticipating change and adapting to more agile business practices in service science. Thus, this research-in-progress sets out to propose the need to develop a framework to enhance a manager 2 ̆ 7 s ability to <b>monitor</b> <b>key</b> performance indicators (KPIs) while improving business process restructuring practices through social network analysis (SNA) ...|$|R
