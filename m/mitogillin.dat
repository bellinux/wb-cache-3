40|$|Fungal ribotoxins, such as <b>mitogillin</b> and {{the related}} Aspergillus toxins restrictocin and α-sarcin, are highly {{specific}} ribonucleases, which inactivate the ribosome enzymatically by cleaving the eukaryotic 28 S RNA of the large ribosomal subunit at a single phosphodiester bond. The site of cleavage occurs between G 4325 and A 4326, which are present in a 14 - base sequence (the α-sarcin loop) conserved among the large subunit rRNAs of all living species. The amino acid residues involved in the cytotoxic activities of <b>mitogillin</b> were investigated by introducing point mutations using hydroxylamine into a recombinant Met-mature <b>mitogillin</b> (<b>mitogillin</b> with a Met codon at the N-terminus and no leader sequence) gene constructed from an Aspergillus fumigatus cDNA clone. These constructs were cloned into a yeast expression vector {{under the control of}} the GAL 1 promoter and transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Upon induction of <b>mitogillin</b> expression, surviving transformants revealed that substitutions of certain amino acid residues on <b>mitogillin</b> abolished its cytotoxicity. Non-toxic mutant genes were cloned into an Escherichia coli expression vector, the proteins overexpressed and purified to homogeneity and their activities examined by in vitro ribonucleolytic assays. These studies identified the His- 49 Tyr, Glu- 95 Lys, Arg- 120 Lys and His- 136 Tyr mutations to have a profound impact on the ribonucleolytic activities of <b>mitogillin.</b> We conclude that these residues are key components of the active site contributing to the catalytic activities of <b>mitogillin.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|<b>Mitogillin</b> is a {{ribonuclease}} secreted by {{the fungus}} Aspergillus restrictus. The substrate for <b>mitogillin</b> is a short, universally conserved, sequence in ribosomal RNA.

40|$|During human infection, Aspergillus fumigatus secretes a 18 -kDa {{protein that}} can be {{detected}} as an immunodominant antigen in the urine of infected patients. Recently, this protein was shown to be <b>mitogillin,</b> a ribotoxin that cleaves a single phosphodiester bond of the 29 S rRNA of eukaryotic ribosomes. We proved the immunogenic capacity of <b>mitogillin</b> in a rabbit animal model, indicating its usefulness as an antigen for serological diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. The <b>mitogillin</b> gene from A. fumigatus was transferred from plasmid pMIT+ to expression vector pQE 30 and expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein. Purified recombinant <b>mitogillin</b> was recognized by serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) of polyclonal rabbit sera that were obtained by immunization with purified native <b>mitogillin.</b> Consequently, we developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies to recombinant <b>mitogillin.</b> In serum samples of patients suffering from aspergilloma (AO; n = 32), invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA; n = 42), or invasive disseminated aspergillosis (IDA; n = 40), a good correlation of production of IgG antibody against <b>mitogillin</b> and clinical disease was observed (for patients with AO, 100 % [32 of 32] were positive; for patients with IPA, 64 % [31 of 42] were positive; for patients with IDA, 60 % [24 of 40] were positive). In contrast, positive titers for serum IgG and IgM antibodies against <b>mitogillin</b> were found in only 1. 3 % of the serum samples of healthy volunteers and positive titers for IgA antibody were found in only 1. 0 % of the serum samples of healthy volunteers (n = 307; specificity = 95. 4 %). These results indicate that recombinant <b>mitogillin</b> expressed in E. coli {{can be used for}} improvement of the serodiagnosis of A. fumigatus-associated diseases...|$|E
40|$|<b>Mitogillin</b> and {{the related}} fungal ribotoxins are highly {{specific}} ribonucleases which inactivate the ribosome enzymatically by cleaving the 23 - 28 S RNA of the large ribosomal subunit at a single phosphodiester bond. The site of cleavage occurs between G 4325 and A 4326 (rat ribosome numbering) which are present {{in one of the}} most conserved sequences (the α- sarcin loop) among the large subunit ribosomal RNAs of all living species. Amino acid sequence comparison of ribotoxins and guanyl/purine ribonucleases have identified domains or residues likely involved in ribonucleolytic activity or cleavage specificity. Fifteen deletion mutants (each 4 to 8 amino acid deletions) in motifs of <b>mitogillin</b> showing little amino acid sequence homology with guanyl/purine ribonucleases were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. Analyses of the purified mutant proteins identified those regions in fungal ribotoxins contributing to ribosome targeting and modulating the catalytic activity of the toxin; some of the identified motifs are homologous to sequences in ribosomal proteins and elongation factors. This mutational study of <b>mitogillin</b> together with the recently published x- ray structure of restrictocin (a close relative of <b>mitogillin)</b> supports the hypothesis that the specific cleavage properties of ribotoxins are the result of natural genetic engineering in which the ribosomal targeting elements of ribosome-associated proteins were inserted into nonessential regions of T 1 - like ribonucleases. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|A major 18 -kD IgE-binding protein from Aspergillus fumigatus (Asp fI) {{has been}} purified.

Crossinhibition radioimmunoassay using murine monoclonal antibody and human IgG and IgE antibodies showed that Asp fI and <b>mitogillin</b> were antigenically indistinguishable. Furthermore, both proteins inhibited protein synthesis in vitro by greater than 90 %. Asp fI was expressed in A. fumigatus {{but not in}} seven other Aspergillus species. The results suggest that Asp fI could play a dual role in the pathogenesis of A. fumigatus-related diseases by promoting colonization through cytotoxic activity and by causing inflammatory reactions involving IgE antibodies...|$|E
40|$|<b>Mitogillin</b> {{and related}} fungal ribotoxins are small basic ribonucleolytic {{proteins}} that inhibit protein synthesis by specifically hydrolyzing a single phosphodiester bond in the universally conserved α-sarcin/ricin loop (SRL) of large subunit ribosomal RNAs. It was previously shown that <b>mitogillin</b> {{is a natural}} derivative of a T 1 /U 2 -like ribonuclease with inserted domains {{that are involved in}} target selection and specificity. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to substitute single amino acids in the previously identified functional domains Ala 1 -Tyr 24 (B 1 -L 1 -B 2 domain) and Lys 106 -Lys 113 (L 4 region). Examination of the activities of the mutants in the digestion of polyinosinic acid (a ribonuclease substrate) and specific cleavage of the SRL shows that Asn 7 Ala and Lys 111 Gln substitutions lead to altered ribonuclease activity and diminished substrate specificity consistent with the proposed functions of these domains.

30|$|Moreover, {{along with}} the high {{antitumor}} effectiveness of IMTXA 33 αS, adverse side effects were not observed at the histological level or {{in the development of}} the treated mice. Thus the scFvA 33 target domain directs α-sarcin to the target cells avoiding the nonspecific toxicity shown in the in vivo assay with free wild type α-sarcin (Figure  1). Similar effects have been previously described for free wild type α-sarcin and other ribotoxins, like <b>mitogillin,</b> in clinical trials (Goldin et al. 1966; Roga et al. 1971). For example, neurologic symptoms, gastrointestinal toxicity or frequent skin rash have been previously described for free α-sarcin in vivo assays with mice (Goldin et al. 1966). <b>Mitogillin</b> has also been evaluated by repeated-dose toxicity tests performed in mice, dogs and monkeys (Roga et al. 1971). In the particular case of mice that received 0.2  mg/kg/day, only two of ten mice survived the test period, and all of them showed weight loss and organs injury (Roga et al. 1971). Similar effects were described in the other trials (Roga et al. 1971). This explains why in the 1970 s these proteins were abandoned as promising antitumoral agents. However, none of these effects have appeared in the immunotoxin-treated mice, despite having used fivefold higher doses of immunotoxin (in nmoles) than those described for the ribotoxin. A result which again favours the interpretation, that the immunotoxin action is highly specific in vivo. Thus, IMTXA 33 αS shows both high efficacy and specificity against colon cancer tumors on in vivo assays with undetectable unwanted side-effects. Further steps in the future have to be considered including different via of administration, determination of the maximum tolerated dose of the molecule, limiting toxicities or a more thorough analysis of the effect on the different tissues and organs, among others. However, the results herein presented would be enough and consistent to be considered as a proof of concept.|$|E

40|$|An {{improvement}} in the serological diagnostic toolbox of invasive aspergillosis (IA) is necessary. So far, most laboratories do not perform antibody detection assays at all to diagnose IA, as commercial test systems are based on crude and undefined antigen mixtures of A. fumigatus. Utilizing the A. fumigatus protein <b>mitogillin,</b> we could demonstrate {{that the use of}} selected characterized immunodominant antigens can improve the serodiagnosis of Aspergillus-related diseases. In an animal model we were able to identify additional 36 immunodominant antigens of a cDNA library of A. fumigatus germlings. Five selected antigens were expressed recombinantly in E. coli, purified and used for Westernblot und ELISA analyses to study the kinetics of the specific antibody response in rabbits that were infected systemically with A. fumigatus. Subsequently, the specific IgG- and IgA-antibody responses against these antigens were studied in patients suffering from proven IA and compared to healthy blood donors and patients with other forms of pneumonia. Furthermore, we examined how total IgG- and IgA-levels influence the diagnostic value of antibody detection in IA patients...|$|E
