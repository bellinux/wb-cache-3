These contain bufotenin (5-MeO-DMT), a psychoactive compound {{that has been used}} in modern times as a recreational drug. Typically, the skin secretions are dried and then smoked. Illicit drug use by licking the skin of a toad has been reported in the media, but this may be an urban myth.|$|E
25|$|It {{is open to}} {{the parties}} to {{restrict}} the possible awards that the arbitrator can make. If this restriction requires a straight choice between the position of one party or the position of the other, then it is known as pendulum arbitration or final offer arbitration. It is designed to encourage the parties to moderate their initial positions so as to make it <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> receive a favorable decision.|$|E
25|$|The {{reactions}} {{are due to}} collisions of reactant species. The frequency with which the molecules or ions collide depends upon their concentrations. The more crowded the molecules are, the <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> are to collide and react with one another. Thus, {{an increase in the}} concentrations of the reactants will usually result in the corresponding increase in the reaction rate, while a decrease in the concentrations will usually have a reverse effect. For example, combustion will occur more rapidly in pure oxygen than in air (21% oxygen).|$|E

25|$|Genetic linkage is the {{tendency}} of DNA sequences that are close together on a chromosome to be inherited together during the meiosis phase of sexual reproduction. Two genetic markers that are physically near to each other {{are unlikely to be}} separated onto different chromatids during chromosomal crossover, and are therefore said to be more linked than markers that are far apart. In other words, the nearer two genes are on a chromosome, the lower the chance of recombination between them, and the <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> are to be inherited together. Markers on different chromosomes are perfectly unlinked.|$|E
25|$|In 1890 Restieaux met Robert Louis Stevenson, {{his wife}} Fanny Vandegrift Stevenson {{and her son}} Lloyd Osbourne during their voyage on the Janet Nicoll, a trading steamer owned by Henderson and Macfarlane of Auckland, New Zealand, which {{operated}} between Sydney, Auckland and into the central Pacific. Fanny records that they made landfall at Funafuti, Niutao and Nanumea; however Jane Resture suggests that it was <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> landed at Nukufetau rather than Funafuti. An account of this voyage was written by Fanny Vandegrift Stevenson and published under the title The Cruise of the Janet Nichol, together with photographs taken by Robert Louis Stevenson and Lloyd Osbourne.|$|E

25|$|Activity theory, in {{contrast}} to disengagement theory, implies that the more active elderly people are, the <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> are {{to be satisfied with}} life. The view that elderly adults should maintain well-being by keeping active has had a considerable history and since 1972, this {{has come to be known}} as activity theory. However, this theory may be just as inappropriate as disengagement for some people as the current paradigm on the psychology of ageing is that both disengagement theory and activity theory may be optimal for certain people in old age, depending on both circumstances and personality traits of the individual concerned. There are also data which query whether, as activity theory implies, greater social activity is linked with well-being in adulthood.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1911, the City of Seattle {{created the}} first {{full-time}} jobs to support Market farmers and customers. The Market Inspector, his assistant, and a janitor were the first ever employees of the Pike Place Market. The Inspector, which was renamed Market Master shortly afterward, assigned stalls to farmers and collected their daily fees. The first Market Master, John Winship, initiated a lottery scheme to replace the previous first-come system. To buy a lottery ticket for a stall, farmers had to pay the next day's fee ahead of time. The Pike Place Market had many Japanese farmers, and Winship at first had them choose from a roll of tickets that made it <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> would receive vendor stalls furthest from the heaviest customer foot traffic. Once the Japanese and other farmers complained about the practice, he quickly stopped it to ensure a fair lottery. In 1912, the Corner Market building was completed, {{across the street from}} the Bartell Building, which would later become the Economy Market.|$|E
25|$|The {{armed forces}} {{that won the}} American Revolution {{consisted}} of the standing Continental Army created by the Continental Congress, together with regular French army and naval forces and various state and regional militia units. In opposition, the British forces consisted of a mixture of the standing British Army, Loyalist militia and Hessian mercenaries. Following the Revolution, the United States was governed by the Articles of Confederation. Federalists argued that this government had an unworkable division of power between Congress and the states, which caused military weakness, as the standing army was reduced to as few as 80 men. They considered it to be bad {{that there was no}} effective federal military crackdown on an armed tax rebellion in western Massachusetts known as Shays' Rebellion. Anti-federalists on the other hand took the side of limited government and sympathized with the rebels, many of whom were former Revolutionary War soldiers. Subsequently, the Constitutional Convention proposed in 1787 to grant Congress exclusive power to raise and support a standing army and navy of unlimited size. Anti-federalists objected to the shift of power from the states to the federal government, but as adoption of the Constitution became more and <b>more</b> <b>likely,</b> <b>they</b> shifted their strategy to establishing a bill of rights that would put some limits on federal power.|$|E

25|$|Another {{important}} {{investigative tool}} at the player's disposal is the Voight-Kampff machine, which tests people {{to determine if}} they are replicants. Usually, Voight-Kampff tests are automatically triggered at certain predetermined points in the game, although on occasion, the player has the option of administering a test. The test depicts a close-up of the subject's eye, and features three needles. The further the top needle moves to the right, the more likely the subject is a replicant; the further the bottom needle moves to the right, the <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> are human. The third needle is on a sweeping axis and measures the intensity of the questions (for every question the player can choose low, medium or high intensity), and the pressure felt by the subject. If the player pushes the subject too far, by asking too many high intensity questions, the test will end before a definite result can be obtained. If the player determines with certainty whether a subject is or is not a replicant, the test ends automatically. The player must then decide what course of action to take, with the decision influencing the rest of the storyline; for example, if a subject tests positive as a replicant, the player can kill them, attempt to arrest them, or let them go.|$|E
25|$|At this point, Tacfarinas sent envoys to Rome {{to offer}} peace {{in return for}} land in the {{province}} {{for himself and his}} followers. It is doubtful that this implied a desire by Tacfarinas' men to become sedentary farmers. <b>More</b> <b>likely,</b> <b>they</b> simply sought restored access to their traditional grazing grounds. If his demands were not met, Tacfarinas warned, he would wage a war without end on the Romans. Although this was probably a serious offer, Tiberius was outraged. He considered it the height of impudence that a man whom he regarded as a deserter and common brigand should be demanding terms like a foreign head of state. The offer was dismissed and Tacfarinas resumed hostilities. Tiberius now demanded that the Senate appoint an especially experienced general to command in Africa so that Tacfarinas could be dealt with once and for all. The man selected by Tiberius was Quintus Junius Blaesus, a veteran who as governor of Pannonia had narrowly escaped lynching by his troops in the great mutinies that broke out on Tiberius' accession in 14 AD. Blaesus owed his selection to his nephew, Sejanus, Tiberius' commander of the Praetorian Guard and trusted right-hand man. For the task, Tiberius gave Blaesus an additional legion (the IX Hispana, transferred from Pannonia on the Danube) and its attached auxiliary regiments, doubling the total force in Africa to around 20,000. He also authorised Blaesus to offer a general pardon to any of Tacfarinas' associates who surrendered - but not to Tacfarinas himself, who was to be captured or killed at all costs.|$|E

500|$|Unlike normal gameplay, {{where all}} {{character}} and background graphics are two-dimensional (2D), combat is rendered entirely in 3D. Wild Arms uses a turn-based battle {{system in which}} the player inputs commands at the start of each round designating which actions take place. The order in which each character and enemy performs these actions is based on their [...] "response" [...] (RES) statistic, which denotes how quickly a particular character can act. [...] The higher a character's response, the <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> are to act before an enemy. The player has the option every round to either use a restorative item from their inventory, use a special skill, run from combat, or attack. Enemy units are defeated when their hit points, a numerical representation of their vitality, reaches zero. Hit points can be reduced by attacking an enemy, either with standard attacks or spells.|$|E
500|$|The overall {{command of}} the Swiss assault was given to Anne de Montmorency. [...] As the Swiss columns {{advanced}} towards the park, he ordered them to pause {{and wait for the}} French artillery to bombard the Imperial defences, but the Swiss refused to obey. [...] Perhaps the Swiss captains doubted that the artillery would have any effect on the earthworks; historian Charles Oman suggests that it is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> were [...] "inspired by blind pugnacity and self-confidence". [...] In any case, the Swiss moved rapidly towards Colonna's position, leaving the artillery behind. [...] There was apparently some rivalry between the two columns, as one, commanded by Arnold Winkelried of Unterwalden, was composed of men from the rural cantons, while the other, under Albert von Stein, consisted of the contingents from Bern and the urban cantons. [...] The advancing Swiss quickly came into range of the Imperial artillery. [...] Unable to take cover on the level fields, they began to take substantial casualties; as many as a thousand Swiss may have been killed by the time the columns reached the Imperial lines.|$|E
500|$|There {{have been}} a few alleged {{sightings}} of large sharks, purportedly megalodon, measuring anywhere from [...] throughout the 1900s, however they all lack supporting evidence. <b>More</b> <b>likely</b> <b>they</b> were misidentified whale sharks. One Polynesian myth regards a [...] shark called Lord of the Deep, but this is probably an exaggeration of a whale shark. Reports of supposedly fresh megalodon teeth, such as those made by [...] in 1873 which were erroneously dated to be around 11,000 to 24,000 years old, are probably teeth that were well-preserved by a thick mineral-crust precipitate of manganese dioxide, and so had a lower decomposition rate and retained a white color during fossilization. Fossil megalodon teeth can vary in color from off-white to dark browns and greys, and some fossil teeth may have been redeposited into a younger stratum. The claims that megalodon could remain elusive in the depths, similar to the megamouth shark which was discovered in 1976, are unlikely as the shark evolved around warm coastal waters and probably could not survive in the cold and nutrient-poor deep sea environment.|$|E

500|$|Favreau {{planned to}} cast a {{newcomer}} in the title role, as [...] "those movies don't require an expensive star; Iron Man's the star, the superhero is the star. The success of X-Men and Spider-Man without being star-driven pieces reassures [...] that the film does have an upside commercially." [...] However, in September 2006, Robert Downey, Jr. was cast in the role. Favreau chose Downey, {{a fan of the}} comic, because he felt the actor's past made him an appropriate choice for the part, explaining [...] "The best and worst moments of Robert's life have been in the public eye. He had to find an inner balance to overcome obstacles that went far beyond his career. That's Tony Stark." [...] Favreau faced opposition from Marvel in casting Downey, but would not take no for an answer, saying, [...] "It was my job as a director to show that it was the best choice creatively ... everybody knew he was talented [...] certainly by studying the Iron Man role and developing that script I realized that the character seemed to line-up with Robert in all the good and bad ways. While preparing for filming, Favreau and Downey were given a tour of SpaceX by Elon Musk.

500|$|When the Athenian {{line was}} ready, {{according}} to one source, the simple signal to advance was given by Miltiades: [...] "At them". Herodotus implies the Athenians ran the whole distance to the Persian lines, a feat {{under the weight of}} hoplite armory generally thought to be physically impossible. <b>More</b> <b>likely,</b> <b>they</b> marched until they reached the limit of the archers' effectiveness, the [...] "beaten zone" [...] (roughly 200 meters), and then broke into a run towards their enemy. Another possibility is that they ran up to the 200 meter-mark in broken ranks, and then reformed for the march into battle from there. [...] Herodotus suggests that {{this was the first time}} a Greek army ran into battle in this way; this was probably because it was the first time that a Greek army had faced an enemy composed primarily of missile troops. All this was evidently much to the surprise of the Persians; [...] "... in their minds they charged the Athenians with madness which must be fatal, seeing that they were few and yet were pressing forwards at a run, having neither cavalry nor archers". Indeed, based on their previous experience of the Greeks, the Persians might be excused for this; Herodotus tells us that the Athenians at Marathon were [...] "first to endure looking at Median dress and men wearing it, for up until then just hearing the name of the Medes caused the Hellenes to panic". Passing through the hail of arrows launched by the Persian army, protected for the most part by their armour, the Greek line finally made contact with the enemy army. The Athenian wings quickly routed the inferior Persian levies on the flanks, before turning inwards to surround the Persian centre, which had been more successful against the thin Greek centre. The battle ended when the Persian centre then broke in panic towards their ships, pursued by the Greeks. Some, unaware of the local terrain, ran towards the swamps where unknown numbers drowned. The Athenians pursued the Persians back to their ships, and managed to capture seven ships, though the majority were able to launch successfully. Herodotus recounts the story that Cynaegirus, brother of the playwright Aeschylus, who was also among the fighters, charged into the sea, grabbed one Persian trireme, and started pulling it towards shore. A member of the crew saw him, cut off his hand, and Cynaegirus died.|$|E
