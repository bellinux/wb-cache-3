30|$|All five {{structures}} A-E exhibit similar transmission spectra {{with the}} same position of the plasmonic resonances, {{it can be concluded}} that all single high-energy and double high/low-energy mills have produced aperture arrays with similar parameters and not significantly altered the geometry of the apertures, since the transmission spectra are very sensitive to the shape of the apertures. The most prominent difference in the transmission of the structures is the significantly increased transmission for the structures milled with the low kV approach. The main transmission peak around 660 nm shows a greater than sevenfold increase for the structures made with the hybrid milling when compared to the 30 kV patterning. The standard 30 -kV <b>milled</b> <b>structure</b> shows lowest transmission. As seen in device B, simply imaging the structure with low kV ions improves the transmission because of the partial removal of the semiconductor damaged layer. The three structures milled with hybrid approach exhibit highest transmission.|$|E

40|$|Scanning probe {{microscopy}} techniques and, in particular, scanning {{spreading resistance}} microscopy (SSRM) {{were used for}} a detailed characterization of focused ion beam (FIB) induced damage in the surrounding of purposely irradiated areas on silicon. It is shown that the damaged area detected using these techniques extends up to several micrometers around the irradiated structures. The influence of the key FIB processing parameters on the FIB induced damage was examined. Parameters which were taken into account are the ion dose (from 1012 to 1018 cm− 2), the <b>milled</b> <b>structure</b> size (circle diameters from 0. 25 to 10 µm), the beam energy (from 10 to 30 keV), and the beam current (from 1. 5 to 280 pA). Moreover, {{the influence of the}} SSRM settings on the measurement results was investigate d. Settings which were considered are the bias voltage and the force applied to the tip during the SSRM analysis. High resolution transmission electron microscopy and secondary ion mass spectroscopy analyses were performed to validate the SSRM results.

40|$|Purpose: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to describe, in vitro, a novel technique to measure the misfit of digitally designed and manufactured implant-supported frameworks according to a new concept based on computer-guided surgery in combination with previously placed mini-implants. Also, the digitally created framework and an impression-based <b>milled</b> <b>structure</b> were compared using strain gauge measurements. Materials and Methods: Acrylic resin and plaster models were prepared to represent the edentulous mandible. After insertion of three mini-implants in the acrylic resin model, a cone-beam computed tomographic scan was performed. The data were imported to planning software, where six implants were virtually inserted. A drill guide and titanium framework were designed and milled using a fully digital computer-aided design/computer-assisted machining protocol. Six implants were inserted using the drill guide attached to the mini-implants. After an impression was made of the acrylic resin model with six implants, the second model (plaster model) was prepared. A second milled titanium structure was fabricated following optical scanning of the acrylic resin model. Strain gauge measurements were done on both structures attached to both models. To validate the results, a high-accuracy industrial optical scanning system was used to capture all connection geometry and the measurements were compared. Results: The accuracy of the digital superstructures was 19, 22, and 10 µm with standard deviations (SD) of 19. 2 (17. 9), 21. 5 (28. 3), and 10. 3 (10. 1) µm for the x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively. For the impression-based superstructure the measured misfit was 11, 20, and 17 µm, with SD 11. 8 (10. 5), 19. 7 (11. 7), and 16. 7 (8. 2) µm for the x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively.

40|$|Physically {{realistic}} {{methods are}} a necessity {{to close the}} gap between reality and numerical result in modelling of tumbling mills. A problem is that tumbling mills often operate in a metastable state because of the difficulty to balance the rate of replenishment of large ore particles from the feed with the consumption in the charge. Understanding of the charge motion within the mill is of significance in mill optimisation. Both the breakage of ore particles and the wear of liners/ball media are closely linked to the charge motion. In this work, a ball charge and its interaction with the <b>mill</b> <b>structure</b> is modelled with the smoothed particle hydrodynamic (SPH) method. The mesh free formulation and the adaptive nature of the SPH method result in a method that handles extremely large deformations and thereby suits modelling of grinding charges and pulp liquids. The flexible rubber lifter and the lining are modelled with the finite element method (FEM). A hyper-elastic model governs the elastic behaviour of the rubber. The comminution process is complex and to include all phenomena that occur in a single numerical model is today not possible. Therefore, modelling the physical interaction between charge, <b>mill</b> <b>structure</b> and pulp liquid is the major goal in this work. The SPH-FEM model can predict responses of the <b>mill</b> <b>structure</b> e. g. stress and strain. All parts of the mill system will affect its response and the model gives the opportunity to study the influence of the <b>mill</b> <b>structure</b> and e. g. pressure and shear stresses in the charge. This computational model also makes it possible to predict, the contact forces for varying mill dimensions, liner combinations and pulp densities. By comparing numerical results with experimental measurement from grinding in a pilot mill equipped with an instrumented rubber lifter a validation is done. The deflection profile of the lifters obtained from SPH-FEM simulation shows a reasonably good correspondence to pilot mill measurements as measured by an embedded strain gauge sensor. This model gives information on the grinding process in tumbling mills and better correlation with experimental measurementsGodkänd; 2011; 20111110 (ysko...|$|R

40|$|An {{effective}} {{dynamic model}} {{is the basis for}} studying rolling mill vibration. Through analyzing characteristics of different types of vibration, a coupling vibration structure model is established, in which vertical vibration, horizontal vibration, and torsional vibration can be well indicated. In addition, based on the Bland-Ford-Hill rolling force model, a dynamic rolling process model is formulated. On this basis, the rolling mill vertical-torsional-horizontal coupled dynamic model is constructed by coupling the rolling process model and the <b>mill</b> <b>structure</b> model. According to this mathematical model, the critical rolling speed is determined and the accuracy of calculated results is verified by experimental data. Then, the interactions between different subsystems are demonstrated by dynamic responses in both time and frequency domains. Finally, the influences of process parameters and structure parameters on system stability are analyzed. And a series of experiments are conducted to verify the correctness of these analysis conclusions. The results show that the vertical-torsional-horizontal coupled model can reasonably characterize the coupling relationship between the <b>mill</b> <b>structure</b> and the rolling process. These studies are helpful for formulating a reasonable technological procedure of the rolling process and determining a feasible dynamic modification strategy of the structure as well...|$|R
