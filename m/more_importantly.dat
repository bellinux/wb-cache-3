5000|$|For women, in particular, tandas {{facilitate}} {{social networks}} {{and makes them}} feel less isolated living in Los Angeles. As the women she quotes jokingly suggest, [...] "the only reason women participate in tandas is for the gossip, otherwise it doesn't make sense." [...] Consequently, participating in tanda gatherings make the separation from their hometown, Yalalag, <b>more</b> tolerable. <b>Importantly,</b> they also help migrants save money.|$|R
5|$|Anonymous {{is tired}} of {{corporate}} interests controlling the internet and silencing the people’s rights to spread information, but <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> the right to SHARE with one another. The RIAA and the MPAA feign to aid the artists and their cause; yet they do no such thing. In their eyes is not hope, only dollar signs. Anonymous will not stand this any longer.|$|E
5|$|Besides the 1874 Supreme Court ruling, a {{critical}} moment came on December 15, 1879, when Judge Lorenzo Sawyer of the Ninth Circuit Court ruled in Orton, 32 F. 457 (C.C.D.

5|$|Facing {{a second}} hostage crisis, General Smith {{and other top}} UN commanders began {{shifting}} strategies. The UN began to redeploy its forces to more defensible locations, {{so that they would}} be harder to attack or take hostage. <b>More</b> <b>importantly,</b> Gen. Rose established the UN Rapid Reaction Force, a heavily armed unit with more aggressive rules of engagement, designed to take offensive action if necessary to prevent hostage-taking and enforce peace agreements.|$|E

5|$|From the start, Habré {{isolated}} {{himself from}} {{the other members of}} the GUNT, which he treated with disdain. Habré's hostility for Libya's influence in Chad united itself with his ambition and ruthlessness: observers concluded that the warlord would never be content with anything short of the highest office. It was thought that sooner or later an armed confrontation between Habré and the pro-Libyan factions would take place, and <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> between Habré and Goukouni.|$|E

5|$|Hotze's force took {{relatively}} high casualties—1,000men killed, wounded or missing (12.5 percent) of his entire force of 8,000—although his losses were comparable to Ney's 800 killed wounded or missing, from his 7,000-man force (11.5 percent). <b>More</b> <b>importantly,</b> though, Hotze succeeded {{not only in}} pushing the French back from Winterthur, but also in uniting his force with Nauendorf's and Charles'. The unified Austrian force completed the semicircle around Masséna's positions at Zürich.|$|E
5|$|In his magisterial three-volume Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion (1772–74), Priestley {{outlined}} {{his theories}} of religious instruction. <b>More</b> <b>importantly,</b> {{he laid out}} his belief in Socinianism. The doctrines he explicated would become the standards for Unitarians in Britain. This work marked a change in Priestley's theological thinking that is critical to understanding his later writings—it {{paved the way for}} his materialism and necessitarianism (the belief that a divine being acts in accordance with necessary metaphysical laws).|$|E
5|$|Mites and {{nematodes}} feed on ticks, {{which are}} also a minor nutritional resource for birds. <b>More</b> <b>importantly,</b> they carry diseases as the primary hosts of pathogens such as spirochaetes, and without their agency, the organisms could not reach their secondary hosts. The diseases caused may debilitate their victims, and ticks may thus be assisting in controlling animal populations and preventing overgrazing.|$|E

5000|$|His {{debut album}} Ginger (1993) was {{released}} on Richie Hawtin's Plus 8 record label in Canada, while in the UK {{it was part of}} Warp Records' Artificial Intelligence series of electronic listening music. A further, more introspective release, G-Spot followed in 1995; a live album, !ive, was also released. Afterwards his work, which included Public Energy No.1 (1997) and A Shocking Hobby (2000) became <b>more</b> experimental, <b>importantly</b> influencing the development of what is known as [...] "IDM", or intelligent dance music.|$|R
25|$|Becoming an Associate {{would mean}} higher funding and, <b>importantly,</b> <b>more</b> {{exposure}} for the passionate and cricket-starved players from Afghanistan, a war-torn country.

5|$|Ort's Oldies, a used {{record store}} on Jackson Street, and its proprietor, William Orten Carlton, {{commonly}} known as Ort, were among the institutional figures that made the Athens music scene possible. Ort has an excellent memory for rock trivia, which served him well in running the store. Perhaps <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> his off-the-wall {{sense of humor and}} warmly iconoclastic personality (and his thrift-sale wardrobe) were regularly on display at parties, gigs and musical venues around town.|$|E
5|$|The Employment Development Centres {{continuously}} seek {{to increase}} their diversity of contract work, in-house industries, social enterprises and job placements into open employment for persons with intellectual disability. These efforts go towards providing income for the trainees {{to pay for their}} own transport, food and leisure. But <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> with jobs to do, persons with intellectual disability can hold their heads high in society as ‘contributors’.|$|E

50|$|The player {{starts the}} game at the bridge of a {{biological}} ship, the Ark. The ship begins {{in the vicinity of}} one of four predetermined planets, each inhabited by a single alien. To make contact with an alien, the player launches an OORXX - a biological probe - to the planet's surface. The player must successfully navigate the probe over a fractal landscape, eventually reaching the alien {{at the end of a}} valley. The UPCOM interface then appears so that the player may talk to the alien and find out <b>more</b> information—most <b>importantly,</b> the coordinates of other inhabited planets.|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{compared}} eye fixation patterns during word and sentence processing in a consistent and an inconsistent alphabetic orthography. German and English {{children as well}} as adults matched on word reading ability read matched sentences while their eye fixation behavior was recorded. Results indicated that German children read in a more small-unit plodder-like style with more diligent first-pass reading and less re-reading. In contrast, English children read in a more large-unit explorer-like style with a greater tendency to skip words, and <b>more</b> regressions. <b>Importantly,</b> these cross-linguistic processing differences largely persisted in the adult readers. Orthographic consistency thus influences both local word recognition and global sentence processing, indeveloping and skilled readers...|$|R
5|$|Because grid {{computing}} systems (described below) {{can easily}} handle embarrassingly parallel problems, modern clusters are typically {{designed to handle}} more difficult problems—problems that require nodes to share intermediate results with each other more often. This requires a high bandwidth and, <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> a low-latency interconnection network. Many historic and current supercomputers use customized high-performance network hardware specifically designed for cluster computing, such as the Cray Gemini network. As of 2014, most current supercomputers use some off-the-shelf standard network hardware, often Myrinet, InfiniBand, or Gigabit Ethernet.|$|E
5|$|Developed in 1939, the Mk. XIV started {{replacing}} the First World War-era Course Setting Bomb Sight in 1942. The Mk. XIV was essentially an automated {{version of the}} Course Setting sight, using a mechanical computer to update the sights in real-time as conditions changed. The Mk. XIV required only 10 seconds of straight flight before the drop and automatically accounted for shallow climbs and dives. <b>More</b> <b>importantly,</b> the Mk. XIV sighting unit was {{much smaller than the}} Course Setting sight, which allowed it to contain a gyro stabilization platform. This kept the sight pointed at the target even as the bomber manoeuvred, dramatically increasing its accuracy and ease of sighting.|$|E
5|$|During {{the debate}} over {{defining}} URLs and URNs it became evident that the two concepts embodied by the terms were merely aspects of the fundamental, overarching notion of resource identification. In June 1994, the IETF published Berners-Lee's RFC 1630: the first Request for Comments that acknowledged the existence of URLs and URNs, and, <b>more</b> <b>importantly,</b> defined a formal syntax for Universal Resource Identifiers— URL-like strings whose precise syntaxes and semantics depended on their schemes. In addition, this RFC attempted to summarize the syntaxes of URL schemes in use at the time. It also acknowledged, but did not standardize, the existence of relative URLs and fragment identifiers.|$|E
40|$|We applied {{our model}} and {{compared}} it to existing methods {{on a variety of}} datasets and biological systems. PANAMA consistently performs better than alternative methods, and finds in particular substantially <b>more</b> trans regulators. <b>Importantly,</b> PANAMA not only identified a greater number of associations, but also yields hits that are biologically more plausible and can be better reproduced between independent studies...|$|R
5000|$|.....ending plea {{bargaining}} has put responsibility back into {{every level of}} our system: police did better investigating; prosecutors and lawyers began preparing their cases better; lazy judges were compelled {{to spend more time}} in court and control their calendars <b>more</b> efficiently. Most <b>importantly,</b> justice was served—and criminals began to realize that they could not continue their arrogant manipulation of a paper-tiger court system.|$|R
40|$|African American {{adults are}} conspicuously {{underrepresented}} {{among those who}} use clinical rehabilitative services and community-based supportive services for acquired neurogenic communication disorders. Low participation rates in clinical speech-language pathology are particularly troubling because African American adults disproportionately {{are at increased risk}} for communication disorders secondary to stroke, dementia, and related neurologic conditions affecting cognitive-communication processes. Lacking empirical evidence, professionals can only speculate about the causes of this widely agreed upon health-care disparity. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to assess the knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes regarding communication disorders in a sample of community-dwelling African American adults. Two assumptions guided the design of this study, namely that 1) human communication, whether intact or impaired, cannot be fully understood apart from its cultural context; and 2) that culturally resonant services are inherently <b>more</b> acceptable and, <b>importantly,</b> <b>more</b> effective. Knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes about a range of communication phenomena, including acquired neurogenic disorders, may, in part, explain population disparities i...|$|R
