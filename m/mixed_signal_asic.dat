The cost of testing is a major one within the manufacturing process, because MEMS accelerometer characterization requires a series of tests that include physical stimuli. The calibration and the functional testing are the most challenging and a wide selection of Automatic Test Equipments (ATEs) is available on the market for this purpose; those equipments provide a full characterization of the Device Under Test (DUT), from low-g to high-g levels, even over temperature. This paper presents a novel solution that experiments an innovative procedure to perform a characterization at medium-g levels.

40|$|Key to {{the design}} of {{spacecraft}} for exploration of the outer planets will be the development of highly integrated and mass/volume efficient electronic systems. Exploration of the outer planets will require optimized propulsion approaches which mandates mass minimization. If one looks at a mission such as the Europa Lander, a high mass/volume efficiency feeds back directly into lower mass for radiation shielding. Concurrently the long mission lengths will drive the need for fault isolation and fault tolerance. The ability to build distributed electronic systems is an inherent requirement and one which is enabled by heterogeneous integration. The electronic packaging approach must be capable of interconnecting various components at a scale comparable with that on the components themselves (chip scale) and it must facilitate efficient integration of the electronics with elements of the spacecraft such as structure or antennae. The concept of 'Heterogeneous Integration' is being explored in the System On A Chip (SOAC) Project at JPL. The goal, of this approach to electronic packaging, is to enable the fabrication and assembly of complete electronic subsystems from components fabricated by a range of processes. Included in such a system could be MEMS sensors, SOI <b>mixed</b> <b>signal</b> <b>ASICs,</b> micro scale passive components and micro power.

The tool is composed of three modules: a layout generator, which includes a parasitic extractor, an analog circuit simulator and circuit optimizer. The two first modules are respectively Mgic and Spice from Berkeley, while the third one, the optimizer, has been developed to evaluate dc, ac, and transient sensitivity simulations performed by Spice and make corrections on the layout sizing. Optimization process atars with a certain topology and atandard sized devices, which is then extracted by Magic and simulated by Spice. Performance is evaluated and a sizing correction is proposed.

40|$|The new DSSC (DEPFET sensor with signal compression) {{detector}} {{system is}} being developed in order to fulfil {{the requirements of the}} future XFEL in Hamburg. The instrument will be able to record X-ray images with a maximum frame rate of 5 MHz and to achieve a high dynamic range. The system is based on a silicon pixel sensor with a new designed non-linear-DEPFET as a central amplifier structure. The detector chip is bump-bonded to <b>mixed</b> <b>signal</b> readout <b>ASICs</b> that provide full parallel readout and temporary data storage. The signals coming from the detector are processed by an analog filter, immediately digitized by 8 -ENOB ADCs and locally stored in a custom designed memory. The ASICs are designed in 130 nm CMOS technology. During the time gap of 99 ms of the XFEL machine, the digital data are sent off the focal plane to a DAQ electronics that acts as an interface to the back-end of the whole instrument. The pixel sensor has been designed so as to combine high energy resolution at low signal charge with high dynamic range. This has been motivated by the desire {{to be able to be}} sensitive to single low energy photons and, at the same time, to measure at other positions of the detector signals corresponding to up to 104 photons of 1 keV. In order to fit this dynamic range into a reasonable output signal swing, achieving at the same time single photon resolution, a strongly non-linear characteristic is required. The new proposed DEPFET provides the required dynamic range compression at the sensor level, considerably facilitating the task of the electronics. At the same time the DEPFET charge handling capacitance is enormously increased with respect to standard DEPFETs. The sensor matrix will comprise 1024 × 1024 pixels of hexagonal shape with a side-length of.

40|$|We {{present the}} {{development}} of the DSSC instrument: an ultra-high speed detector system for the new European XFEL in Hamburg. The DSSC will be able to record X-ray images with a maximum frame rate of 4. 5 MHz. The system is based on a silicon pixel sensor with a DEPFET as a central amplifier structure and has detection efficiency close to 100 % for X-rays from 0. 5 keV up to 10 keV. The sensor will have a size of approximately 210 x 210 mm(2) composed of 1024 x 1024 pixels with hexagonal shape. Two hundred fifty six <b>mixed</b> <b>signal</b> readout <b>ASICs</b> are bump-bonded to the detector. They are designed in 130 nm CMOS technology and provide full parallel readout. The signals coming from the sensor are processed by an analog filter, immediately digitized by 8 -bit ADCs and locally stored in an SRAM, which is able to record at least 640 frames. In order to fit the dynamic range of about 10 (4) photons of 1 keV per pixel into a reasonable output signal range, achieving at the same time single 1 keV photon resolution, a non-linear characteristic is required. The proposed DEPFET provides the needed dynamic range compression at the sensor level. The most exciting and challenging property is that the single 1 keV photon resolution and the high dynamic range are accomplished within the 220 ns frame rate of the system. The key properties and the main design concepts of the different building blocks of the system are discussed. Measurements with the analog front-end of the readout ASIC and a standard DEPFET have already shown a very low noise which makes it possible to achieve the targeted single photon resolution for 1 keV photons at 4. 5 MHz and also for 0. 5 keV photons at half of the speed. In the paper the new experimental results obtained coupling a single pixel to an 8 8 ASIC prototype are shown.
