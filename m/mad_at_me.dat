500|$|Although it {{had been}} {{reported}} {{for a number of}} years that Jackson had an abusive childhood, he first spoke openly about it in his 1993 interview with Oprah Winfrey. He grimaced when speaking of the childhood abuse at the hands of his father; he believed he had missed out on much of his childhood years, acknowledging that he often cried from loneliness. In the same interview, speaking of his father, Jackson said, [...] "There were times when he'd come to see me, I'd get sick... I'd start to regurgitate. I'm sorry... Please don't be <b>mad</b> <b>at</b> <b>me...</b> But I do love him." [...] In Jackson's other high profile interview Living with Michael Jackson (2003), he covered his face with his hand and began crying when talking about his childhood abuse.|$|E
500|$|... "Why Does This Always Happen To Me?" [...] emulates {{the style}} of Ben Folds. According to music critic Nathan Rabin, the song [...] "amplifies the noxious {{self-absorption}} of the American character to hilarious extremes" [...] by describing a narrator who, upon hearing {{about a number of}} horrible tragedies, only complains about the (minor) inconveniences that affect him. [...] Folds himself plays piano on the track. Yankovic later told The A.V. Club: [...] "Ben and I are old friends at this point, and of course I sought his keyboard work for that song. So he came in and knocked it out. I think that’s an F-Sharp, so he was kind of <b>mad</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> for that." [...] "Bob" [...] is a style parody of Bob Dylan, composed entirely of palindromes (for instance, the song's first line is [...] "I, man, am regal—a German am I", which reads the same when reversed). Rabin argues that the song's lyrics [...] "sound cryptic enough to be genuine Dylanesque, but are in fact palindromes deliver in an uncanny re-creation of Dylan's nasal whine." [...] The album's closer, [...] "Genius in France", emulates the idiosyncratic style of Frank Zappa. Zappa's son, Dweezil performed the song's intro guitar solo. Lyrically, the song describes a person who, although rejected elsewhere, finds acceptance in France.|$|E

He abandoned boxing because of two incidents: one with his boxing coach {{and one with}} Ip Man. The first incident apparently occurred because Wong accidentally struck his boxing coach during sparring. The angry coach attacked in earnest, only to be eventually knocked out by Wong; the incident caused Wong to leave boxing. In another account, however, Wong said he had defeated his boxing coach with wing chun techniques: [...] "I was sparring with my instructor and I hit him very hard, he got real <b>mad</b> and came <b>at</b> <b>me</b> very hard.

The album was intended to get back in touch with a more youthful audience from other Arab nations, with whom had taken slight dis-interest in Karam's music from the late 90s. This was shown though songs like Tahamouni (They accused me) which included attempts at rapping, and Ew'a Tekoun Ze'alt (I hope you're not <b>mad</b> <b>at</b> <b>me)</b> which seemed to have a complete Western influence. The songs had a youthful sound.|$|E

60|$|As I have said, I forgot everything. In racing {{across an}} open space I ran full tilt upon {{a colony of}} snakes. They did not deter me. I was <b>mad.</b> They struck <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> but I ducked and dodged and ran on. Then there was a python that ordinarily would have sent me {{screeching}} to a tree-top. He did run me into a tree; but the Swift One was going out of sight, and I sprang {{back to the ground}} and went on. It was a close shave. Then there was my old enemy, the hyena. From my conduct he was sure something was going to happen, and he followed me for an hour. Once we exasperated a band of wild pigs, and they took after us. The Swift One dared a wide leap between trees that was too much for me. I had to take to the ground. There were the pigs. I didn't care. I struck the earth within a yard of the nearest one. They flanked me as I ran, and chased me into two different trees out of the line of my pursuit of the Swift One. I ventured the ground again, doubled back, and crossed a wide open space, with the whole band grunting, bristling, and tusk-gnashing at my heels.|$|R

Then he grew very red--then hideously pale--then, as if highly amused with what I had insinuated, he began a loud and boisterous laugh, which, to my astonishment, he kept up, with gradually increasing vigor, for ten minutes or more. In conclusion, he fell flat and heavily upon the deck. When I ran to uplift him, to all appearance he was dead.|$|R
