5|$|In the 1987 elections, Evans {{defeated}} Preckwinkle by a 77% to 21% margin. In 1987, {{although both}} the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times endorsed Evans, they praised Preckwinkle for her numerous qualities, including intelligence and independence, and expressed hopes she would continue in politics. Preckwinkle {{was endorsed by}} then state Rep. Carol <b>Moseley</b> <b>Braun</b> and also by the Independent Voters of Illinois-Independent Precinct Organization, but not by Harold Washington, who endorsed Evans.|$|E
5|$|Decisions by Republican {{incumbent}} Peter Fitzgerald and his Democratic predecessor Carol <b>Moseley</b> <b>Braun</b> to {{not participate}} in the election resulted in wide-open Democratic and Republican primary contests involving fifteen candidates. In the March 2004 primary election, Obama won in an unexpected landslide—which overnight made him a rising star within the national Democratic Party, started speculation about a presidential future, and led to the reissue of his memoir, Dreams from My Father. In July 2004, Obama delivered the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, seen by 9.1million viewers. His speech was well received and elevated his status within the Democratic Party.|$|E

25|$|Chicago is home {{to three}} of six African-American US Senators who have served since Reconstruction, who are all Democrats: Carol <b>Moseley</b> <b>Braun</b> (19931999), Former President Barack Obama (20052008), and Roland Burris (20092010).|$|E
25|$|Another {{high-profile}} endorsement followed {{five days}} after Harkin's. Former U.S. Senator and ambassador Carol <b>Moseley</b> <b>Braun,</b> whose own presidential candidacy had been endorsed by the National Organization for Women, shut down her struggling campaign and gave her support to Dean.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, {{angered by}} {{incumbent}} Democratic senator Alan Dixon's vote to confirm Clarence Thomas, <b>Moseley</b> <b>Braun</b> challenged {{him in the}} primary election. Candidate Albert Hofeld's campaign ran many anti-Dixon ads, and <b>Moseley</b> <b>Braun</b> won the Democratic primary. On November 3, 1992, {{she became the first}} African-American woman to be elected to the United States Senate, defeating Republican Richard S. Williamson. Her election marked the first time Illinois had elected a woman and the first time a black person was elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate. She (along with Republican Edward Brooke) was one of two African Americans to serve in the Senate in the 20th century and was the sole African American in the Senate for her entire term. She was the first woman to serve on the Senate Finance Committee.|$|E
25|$|She {{announced}} her intention {{to run for}} the Democratic Party presidential nomination in February 2003. On January 15, 2004, two days after a disappointing third place showing in the D.C. primary and four days before the Iowa caucuses, <b>Moseley</b> <b>Braun</b> dropped out of the race and endorsed Howard Dean.|$|E
25|$|Black Action Society, the {{recognized}} student organization for promoting the cultural, educational, political, and social needs {{of black students}} at the university. It comprises nine committees including {{the publication of the}} student-run publication BlackLine as well as community outreach, political action, and programing. BAS has hosted lectures by such figures as Cornel West, Spike Lee, and Carol <b>Moseley</b> <b>Braun.</b>|$|E
25|$|Despite her {{reputation}} as a liberal, <b>Moseley</b> <b>Braun</b> possessed something of a centrist record on economic issues. She voted for the 1993 budget package and against the welfare reform laws passed in 1996, but on many other matters she was more conservative. <b>Moseley</b> <b>Braun</b> {{voted in favor of}} the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and lawsuit reform measures like the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (she was also among the minority of Democrats to support the even more controversial Common Sense Product Liability and Legal Reform Act of 1995). She also voted contrary to the interests of the more populist wing of the party by voting for the Freedom to Farm Act and the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Like her Illinois colleague, fellow Democrat Paul Simon, she voted in favor of a Balanced Budget Amendment to the United States Constitution and also to place a nuclear spent fuel storage facility in Nevada, a move strongly opposed by many Democrats, especially former Majority Leader Harry Reid.|$|E
25|$|During the 1990s, Simon opposed {{both the}} Republicans' Contract with America, and President Bill Clinton's welfare reforms. He {{was one of}} 21 Senators {{to vote against the}} Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act. In 1996, Simon joined {{thirteen}} other Senators (including his fellow U.S. Senator from Illinois, Carol <b>Moseley</b> <b>Braun)</b> in voting against the Defense of Marriage Act, which prohibited federal recognition of same-sex marriage.|$|E
25|$|Women {{were not}} allowed to wear {{trousers}} on the US Senate floor until 1993. In 1993, Senators Barbara Mikulski and Carol <b>Moseley</b> <b>Braun</b> wore trousers onto the floor in defiance of the rule, and female support staff followed soon after, with the rule being amended later that year by Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Martha Pope to allow women to wear trousers on the floor so long as they also wore a jacket.|$|E
25|$|Decisions by Republican {{incumbent}} Peter Fitzgerald and his Democratic predecessor Carol <b>Moseley</b> <b>Braun</b> not {{to contest}} the race launched wide-open Democratic and Republican primary contests involving fifteen candidates. Obama's candidacy was boosted by Axelrod's advertising campaign featuring images of the late Chicago Mayor Harold Washington and an endorsement by {{the daughter of the}} late Paul Simon, former U.S. Senator for Illinois. He received over 52% of the vote in the March 2004 primary, emerging 29% ahead of his nearest Democratic rival.|$|E
25|$|On {{social issues}} however, she was {{significantly}} {{more liberal than}} many of her fellow senators. She was strongly pro-choice, voting against the ban on partial-birth abortions and the restrictions on funding in military bases for abortions. She also voted {{against the death penalty}} and in favor of gun control measures. <b>Moseley</b> <b>Braun</b> was one of only sixteen senators to vote against the Communications Decency Act and one of only fourteen to vote against the Defense of Marriage Act. She delivered a eulogy to Thurgood Marshall on January 26, 1993.|$|E
25|$|Though Dean lagged {{in early}} endorsements, he {{acquired}} many critical ones as his campaign snowballed. By {{the time of}} the Iowa caucuses, he led among commitments from superdelegates– elected officials and party officers entitled to convention votes by virtue of their positions. On November 12, 2003, he received the endorsements of the Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. Dean received the endorsement of former Vice President and 2000 presidential candidate Al Gore, on December 9, 2003. In the following weeks Dean was endorsed by former U.S. senators Bill Bradley and Carol <b>Moseley</b> <b>Braun,</b> unsuccessful Democratic presidential candidates from the 2000 and 2004 primaries, respectively.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, the Illinois Senator made {{headlines}} when she convinced the Senate Judiciary Committee not to renew a design patent for the United Daughters of the Confederacy because it contained the Confederate flag. The patent had been routinely renewed {{for nearly a}} century, and despite the Judiciary Committee’s disapproval, the Senate was poised to pass a resolution sponsored by Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina that included a provision to authorize {{the extension of the}} federal patent. <b>Moseley</b> <b>Braun</b> threatened to filibuster the legislation “until this room freezes over.” She also made a plea to her colleagues about the symbolism of the Confederate flag, declaring, “It has no place in our modern times, place in this body, place in our society.” Swayed by Moseley Braun’s argument, the Senate rejected the UDC’s application to renew its patent.|$|E
25|$|Obama, {{having a}} Caucasian mother and Kenyan {{father of the}} Luo ethnic group, became the first African American {{as well as the}} first bi-racial {{president}}. Although he may have been the first black president to win an election, Obama was not the first African American to run for president. Shirley Chisolm, Jesse Jackson, Lenora Fulani, Carol <b>Moseley</b> <b>Braun,</b> Alan Keyes, and Al Sharpton all at some point were in the process for presidential nomination. The Obama-Biden ticket was also the first winning ticket in American history on which neither candidate was a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant; Biden is Roman Catholic and is the first Roman Catholic to be elected Vice President; all other tickets with Catholic vice presidential candidates had been defeated (1964, 1972, 1984). Obama and Biden were the first President and Vice President elected from the Senate since 1960 (John F. Kennedy/Lyndon B. Johnson) (in the previous election cycle (2004) Democrats also nominated two sitting Senators, John Kerry of Massachusetts and John Edwards of North Carolina, but they lost to incumbents Bush and Cheney), Obama became the first Northern Democratic president since Kennedy, and the Obama-Biden ticket was the first winning Democratic ticket to feature two Northerners since 1940 (Franklin D. Roosevelt/Henry A. Wallace). Also, Obama became the first Democratic candidate to win a majority of the popular vote since Jimmy Carter in 1976, the first to win a majority of both votes and states since Lyndon Johnson in 1964, and the first Northern Democrat to win a majority of both votes and states since Franklin Roosevelt in 1944. This was the first presidential election since 1952 in which neither of the major party candidates was either the incumbent President or Vice-President.|$|E
