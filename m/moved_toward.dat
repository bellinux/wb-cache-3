5|$|On 22 May 1799, Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf, led a large column {{across the}} Rhine at Constance, Stein and Eglisau. Hotze's force had already crossed the Rhine further east, {{where it was}} still a {{mountain}} stream, and passed through the Grisons, into Toggenburg, and <b>moved</b> <b>toward</b> Zürich.|$|E

5|$|By 1992, {{black metal}} scenes {{had begun to}} emerge in areas outside Scandinavia, {{including}} Germany, France, and Poland. The 1993 murder of Mayhem's Euronymous by Burzum's Varg Vikernes provoked intensive media coverage. Around 1996, when many in the scene felt the genre was stagnating, several key bands, including Burzum and Finland's Beherit, <b>moved</b> <b>toward</b> an ambient style, while symphonic black metal was explored by Sweden's Tiamat and Switzerland's Samael. In the late 1990s and early 2000s decade, Norway's Dimmu Borgir brought black metal closer to the mainstream, as did Cradle of Filth.|$|E
5|$|Frederick {{realized}} the gambit by 2:30 pm. By 3:00pm, the entire Prussian army had struck camp, loaded their tents and gear, and fallen into line. Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz took his 38 squadrons of cavalry and <b>moved</b> <b>toward</b> the Janus and Pölzen, small hills between Rossbach and Reichertswerben. Except {{for a few}} moments, the advance was hidden entirely from view. He was followed by Colonel Karl Friedrich von Moller's battery of 18 guns, which positioned themselves temporarily on the reverse of the Janus between the infantry's left and the cavalry's right. Seven squadrons remained in Rossbach to contain Saint-Germain's advanced post.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Juliette was {{the strongest}} {{hurricane}} and final tropical cyclone of the inactive 1995 Pacific hurricane season. The tenth named storm of the season, Juliette formed on September16 from a tropical wave off the southwest coast of Mexico. For {{the majority of its}} track, the storm <b>moved</b> <b>toward</b> the west-northwest, and Juliette quickly intensified to major hurricane status. On September20, the hurricane reached peak winds of 150mph (240km/h). Later it turned toward the northeast, briefly threatening the Baja California Peninsula, although the hurricane never affected land.|$|E

5|$|On 20 December 1943, the under-strength Loyal Edmonton Regiment <b>moved</b> <b>toward</b> Ortona, {{with the}} Seaforth Highlanders {{covering}} their eastern flank. Throughout the day, they encountered {{heavy machine gun}} fire during their attempts to enter Ortona. By nightfall, both battalions held a toehold on {{the western edge of}} Ortona, yet had encountered heavy resistance in their attempts to secure it. The following day, D Company of the Loyal Edmonton Regiment launched attacks eastward towards the city centre, but accurate German sniper fire rapidly stalled the advance.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Halong, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Inday, passed just south of Guam one week after Typhoon Chataan struck the island and left heavy damage. The seventh named storm of the season, Halong {{developed}} near the same location as Chataan on July5 near the Marshall Islands. For much of its duration, the storm <b>moved</b> <b>toward</b> the northwest, gradually intensifying. Early on July10, Halong passed just south of Guam as a tropical storm, producing high waves and gusty winds on the island. The storm disrupted relief efforts from Chataan, causing additional power outages but little damage.|$|E

40|$|Richard Rorty's Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature {{strikes a}} deathblow to modern European {{philosophy}} by {{telling a story}} about the emergence, development and decline of its primary props: the correspondence theory of truth, the notion of privileged representations and the idea of a self-reflective transcendental subject. Rorty's fascinating tale—his-story—is regulated by three fundamental shifts which he delineates in detail and promotes in principle: the <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> anti-realism or conventionalism in ontology, the <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> the demythologizing of the Myth of the Given or anti-foundationalism in epistemology, and the <b>move</b> <b>toward</b> detranscendentalizing the subject or dismissing the mind as a sphere of inquiry...|$|R
5|$|With the saloons and grocers closed, about 150 men, {{armed with}} Winchester rifles, <b>moved</b> <b>toward</b> Chinatown in Rock Springs. They moved in two groups and entered Chinatown by {{crossing}} separate bridges. The larger group entered {{by way of}} the railroad bridge and was divided into squads, a few of which remained standing {{on the opposite side of}} the bridge outside Chinatown. The smaller group entered {{by way of the}} town's plank bridge.|$|E
5|$|A {{percentage}} {{of each group}} working in less contaminated areas was badged. Eventually, 18,875 film-badge dosimeters were issued to about 15% of the total work force. On {{the basis of this}} sampling, a theoretical total exposure was calculated for each person who did not have a personal badge. As expected, exposures for target ship crewmen who reboarded their ships after Baker were higher than those for support ship crews. The hulls of support ships that entered the lagoon after Baker became so radioactive that sleeping quarters were <b>moved</b> <b>toward</b> the center of each ship. Of the total mass of radioactive particles scattered by each explosion, 85% was unfissioned plutonium which produces alpha radiation not detected by film badges or Geiger counters. There was no method of detecting plutonium in a timely fashion, and participants were not monitored for ingestion of it.|$|E
5|$|As Barbara <b>moved</b> <b>toward</b> the Canadian Maritimes, {{it began}} to undergo an extratropical transition, {{completing}} the transition by late on August15 just south of Nova Scotia. However, the Canadian Hurricane Centre assessed Barbara as remaining tropical until after it turned northward and struck eastern Nova Scotia on August16. At this time, a trough developed to the southeast of the storm, and Barbara later tracked just west of Newfoundland. A new low formed {{in association with the}} trough, and as Barbara rapidly headed northward, the developing center moved more slowly. However, the new low quickly gained strength and became the more intense of the two storm systems. Barbara then stalled near Goose Bay and lost its tropical identity, dissipating late on August16.|$|E

5|$|Born Else Ochsner in Esbjerg, Denmark, Christensen {{developed}} her anarcho-syndicalist sympathies {{while living}} in Copenhagen. From this position she <b>moved</b> <b>toward</b> the Strasserite National Bolshevik faction of the National Socialist Workers' Party of Denmark, which brought together a far right emphasis on race with a left-wing approach to economics. In 1937 she married fellow Danish Nazi activist Aage Alex Christensen, however because of their National Bolshevik allegiances they were placed under heavy scrutiny amidst the German occupation of Denmark during World War II. After the war they moved to England and then Canada, settling in Toronto in 1951. Corresponding with various far right activists, she came upon {{the writings of the}} American far right ideologue Francis Parker Yockey and the Australian Odinist Alexander Rud Mills, both of whom had a profound influence on her.|$|E
5|$|By mid-morning, Ney had <b>moved</b> <b>toward</b> {{the front}} with Gazan's brigade {{and he could}} see the enemy {{advancing}} toward him; still expecting Soult's reinforcements on his flanks, he anticipated an easy victory, like the one three days earlier in which Masséna's force had pounded Hotze's column at Frauenfeld. He did not realise, at least not yet, that Hotze had 8,000men with which to secure the crossroads north of Winterthur. Ney brought more of his men to the front, and moved against the Austrian left. In an Austrian volley, he and his horse went down; the horse was killed and Ney received a knee injury. He had his wound bandaged, called for another horse, and reentered the fight.|$|E
5|$|The {{long march}} from Seminary Ridge had left {{some of the}} Southern units disorganized, and their commanders paused {{momentarily}} at Plum Run to reorganize. Hancock led the II Corps brigade of Col. George L. Willard to meet Barksdale's brigade as it <b>moved</b> <b>toward</b> the ridge. Willard's New Yorkers drove the Mississippians back to Emmitsburg Road. Barksdale was wounded in his left knee, followed by a cannonball to his left foot, and finally was hit by another bullet to his chest, knocking him off his horse. His troops were forced to leave him for dead on the field, and he died the next morning in a Union field hospital. Willard was also killed, and Confederate guns drove back Willard's men in turn.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Andres is {{one out of}} two {{tropical}} cyclones {{on record}} to strike El Salvador. The first named storm of the active 1997 Pacific hurricane season, Andres formed on June 1 {{off the coast of}} Mexico. It initially <b>moved</b> <b>toward</b> the coast, although a change in steering winds turned the storm toward Mexico and Guatemala. After passing just offshore, Andres again changed direction toward the southeast, gradually weakening in the process. On June 7, it turned toward and hit El Salvador before dissipating. The storm brought rainfall to coastlines along much of its path, destroying some houses and inflicted damage. Two fishermen were reported missing in Nicaragua due to high seas, and there were four deaths in El Salvador.|$|E
5|$|After {{its first}} peak in intensity, Nangka {{slightly}} weakened as convection {{along the west}} side of the system was restricted due to the TUTT cell, and the eye became cloud-filled. Decreasing wind shear and increasing sea surface temperatures allowed the intensification trend to resume, and the structure became more symmetric late on July8 as it <b>moved</b> <b>toward</b> the Northern Marianas Islands. A well-defined inner eye re-developed inside of an outer eyewall. On July9, the JTWC upgraded Nangka to a super typhoon, estimating peak 1minute winds of 250km/h (155mph). The JMA also assessed a 10minute peak of 185km/h (115mph). At 06:00UTC on July9, the eye of Nangka passed over the uninhabited island of Alamagan. The typhoon later weakened while turning more to the west due to increased wind shear. The eye became cloud-filled and was no longer visible by July11, although the organization was sustained by good outflow to the south. However, the convection reorganized the next day and the eye reformed. By that time, Nangka was slowing and nearly stationary as the subtropical ridge receded to the east.|$|E
5|$|As a player, Adams {{created the}} concept of the shortstop position, {{according}} to Thorn and Baseball Hall of Fame researcher Freddy Berowski. In the first five years the Knickerbockers played, the team fielded anywhere from eight to eleven players. The only infielders were the players covering each of the bases; if there were more than eight players, extra outfielders were sometimes used. The outfielders had difficulty throwing baseballs into the infield, because of the balls' light weight. Adams' shortstop position, at which he started playing in about 1849 or 1850, was used to field throws from the outfielders and throw to the three infielders. With the advent of higher-quality baseballs, Adams <b>moved</b> <b>toward</b> the infield, since the distance the balls could travel increased. Prior to the invention of the shortstop, large gaps existed in the defensive positioning of infields; defensive players tended to stand by bases, leaving empty space in between them for batters. The shortstop filled one of the two gaps.|$|E
