40|$|Crawford’s uvby ß {{calibration}} method is examined for A-type stars by comparing {{it with the}} pulsational variations of the observable m 1, c 1 and MV for the δ Scuti star FG Vir. The fit between the calibration values of m 1 and MV and the respective measurements for FG Vir are tested {{as a function of}} temperature based on 3068 4 -colour values taken at the Observatorio de Sierra Nevada in Spain during the years 2002 and 2003. Testing is performed by means of linear regression. The fit between the measured index m 1 of FG Vir and the m 1 index of the Hyades is nearly perfect. A fit between the calibration <b>value</b> <b>MV</b> and the <b>measured</b> <b>values</b> of FG Vir cannot be obtained with Crawford’s calibration procedure in a straightforward manner. In order to achieve an optimal fit for MV two modifications of the calibration procedure are investigated and discussed. (i) the position of the ZAMS given by Crawford is replaced by the position of the ZAMS given by Mermilliod; (ii) the influence of the mass difference on c 1 is taken into account...|$|R

An Ag/AgCl wire electrode holder (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA) was inserted {{into the back of}} the microelectrode in order to establish electrical contact with the bathing solution. The ground electrode was a dry reference (DRIREF- 2, World Precision Instruments) that was inserted into the sample bath. In order to obtain a calibration line, microelectrodes were calibrated at the beginning and end of each experiment using standard solutions covering the experimental range of each ion. Both the slope and intercept of the calibration line were used to calculate the respective ion concentration from the <b>mV</b> <b>values</b> <b>measured</b> during the experiment near and distant from the root surface. A detailed description of the ion-selective vibrating probe system was reported by Feijó et al. [8] and Ramos et al [25, 26].

However, measured levels differed considerably among measurement kits available in Japan until 2003. Therefore, standardization of the <b>measured</b> <b>values</b> was attempted by measuring growth hormone levels in a sample of healthy adult individuals every year using the different kits. A standardization equation was developed for each kit through linear structural relationship with the mean values of the used kits and <b>measured</b> <b>values</b> in each kit as random variables. A Pearson’s correlation coefficient between the mean values of all kits and the <b>measured</b> <b>values</b> from each kit was also obtained. Sources for the marked discrepancies amongst the <b>measured</b> <b>values</b> in the different kits were also explored. The obtained values for slopes and intercepts in the equations varied considerably, but the standard values obtained from these equations after the <b>measured</b> <b>values</b> for each kit were transformed into standard values served well as the standard.

Systematic and random errors are distinguished. The measurement can be done directly or indirectly, depending on the chosen measurement procedure.
