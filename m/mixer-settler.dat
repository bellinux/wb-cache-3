Advantages of the centrifugal equipment over the pump-mix mixer-set-tler are associated principally with the fiftyfold reduction in liquid volume holdup, and include reduced exposure of the solvent to radiolytic degradation, increased nuclear safety, easier flush-ing, and greater operating flexibility.

40|$|International audienceThe {{extraction}} of cadmium from phosphoric media has been studied. The D 2 EHDTPA {{was used as}} extractant and dodecane as diluent. No third phase was observed in the investigated conditions. A continuous micro-pilot scale <b>mixer-settler</b> was successfully tested for both extraction and stripping. More than 99 % extraction rate was obtained in steady-state conditions with a flow rate ratio Aqueous/Organic equal to 1. 1. Continuous stripping was performed using HCl 4 M.

30|$|Holdup minima can be {{justified}} by evaluation of operating regimes in the column, which here corresponds the transition from <b>mixer-settler</b> regime to dispersion regime. <b>Mixer-settler</b> regime {{is characterized by the}} separation of dispersed and continuous phases into individual distinct layers in the inter-plate spaces during the quiescent portion of the pulse cycle. This condition enhances the formation of larger drops which stay on the internals and leads to the increase of holdup. When pulsation introduces into the column, residence time declines due to higher shear forces and drop breakage and as a consequence, the holdup decreases initially. However, with further increase of Af above the critical value, the holdup begins to increase considerably. It is mainly because of frequent drop breakage which leads to the formation of smaller drops and consequently longer residence time for the dispersed phase drops.|$|E

Following shakedown runs with solutions containing uranium only, two flowsheet test runs were made with a simulated LWR fuel solution (U/Pu = 100).

40|$|The {{literature}} {{relating to}} the extraction of the aromatics, benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX) using different commercial solvents, and to <b>mixer-settler</b> design and performance, has been reviewed. Liquid-liquid equilibria of the ternary systems: hexane-benzene-sulfolane, n-heptane-toluene-sulfolane, and octane-xylene-sulfolane were determined experimentally at temperatures of 30 oC, 35 oC, and 40 oC. The work was then extended to a multicomponent system. The data were correlated by using Hand's method and {{were found to be}} in a good agreement with theoretical predictions using the UNIFAC method. A study was made of the performance of a 10 -stage laboratory <b>mixer-settler</b> cascade for the extraction of BTX from a synthetic reformate utilizing sulfolane as a solvent. Murphree stage efficiency decreased with stage number but 99 % extraction was achievable within 4 stages. The effects of temperature, phase ratio, and agitator speed were investigated. The efficiency increased with agitator speed but > 1050 rpm resulted in secondary haze formation. An optimum temperature of 30 oC was selected from the phase equilibria; the optimum solvent: feed ratio was 3 : 1 for 4 stages. The experimental overall mass transfer coefficients were compared with those predicted from single drop correlations and were in all cases greater, by a factor of 1. 5 to 3, due to the surface renewal associated with drop break-up and coalescence promoted by agitation. A similar investigation was performed using real reformate from the Kuwait Oil Company. The phase ratios were in the range 0. 5 to 1 to 3. 25 to 1, the agitator speed 1050 rpm, and the operating temperature 30 oC. A maximum recovery of 99 % aromatics was achieved in 4 stages at a phase ratio of 3. 25 to 1. A backflow model was extended to simulate conditions in the <b>mixer-settler</b> cascade with this multicomponent system. Overall mass transfer coefficients were estimated by obtaining the best fit between experimental and predicted concentration profiles. They were up to 10 % greater than those with the synthetic feed but close agreement was not possible because the distribution coefficient and phase ratio varied with stage number.
