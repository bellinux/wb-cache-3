5|$|The {{average age}} of <b>menarche</b> is 12–15. They may {{occasionally}} start as early as eight, and this onset may still be normal. This first period often occurs later {{in the developing world}} than the developed world.|$|E
5|$|The {{average age}} of <b>menarche</b> is {{approximately}} 12.5 years in the United States, 12.7 in Canada, 12.9 in the UK and 13.1 years in Iceland. Factors such as genetics, diet and overall health can affect timing.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{barriers}} also {{protect against}} infection. The skin and respiratory tract secrete antimicrobial peptides {{such as the}} β-defensins. Enzymes such as lysozyme and phospholipase A2 in saliva, tears, and breast milk are also antibacterials. Vaginal secretions serve as a chemical barrier following <b>menarche,</b> when they become slightly acidic, while semen contains defensins and zinc to kill pathogens. In the stomach, gastric acid and proteases serve as powerful chemical defenses against ingested pathogens.|$|E
5|$|Classical Athenian girls {{probably}} reached <b>menarche</b> {{at about}} age fourteen, {{when they would}} have married. Girls who died before marriage were mourned for their failure to reach maturity. Memorial vases for dead girls in classical Athens often portrayed them dressed as brides, and were sometimes shaped like loutrophoroi (vases which held water used to bathe before the wedding day).|$|E
5|$|The {{cessation}} of menstrual cycles {{at the end}} of a woman's reproductive period is termed menopause. The average age of menopause in women is 52 years, with anywhere between 45 and 55 being common. Menopause before age 45 is considered premature in industrialised countries. Like the age of <b>menarche,</b> the age of menopause is largely a result of cultural and biological factors; however, illnesses, certain surgeries, or medical treatments may cause menopause to occur earlier than it might have otherwise.|$|E
5|$|The {{first period}} usually begins between twelve and {{fifteen years of}} age, {{a point in time}} known as <b>menarche.</b> They may {{occasionally}} start as early as eight, and this onset may still be normal. The average age of the first period is generally later in the developing world and earlier in developed world. The typical length of time between the first day of one period and {{the first day of the}} next is 21 to 45 days in young women and 21 to 35 days in adults (an average of 28 days).|$|E
25|$|Premature or delayed <b>menarche</b> {{should be}} {{investigated}} if <b>menarche</b> begins before 9 years, if <b>menarche</b> has not begun by age 15, {{if there is no}} breast development by age 13, or if there is no period by 3 years after the onset of breast development.|$|E
25|$|In {{very rare}} instances, <b>menarche</b> may occur at an unusually early age, {{preceding}} thelarche and {{other signs of}} puberty. This is termed isolated premature <b>menarche,</b> but other causes of bleeding must be investigated and excluded. Growth is usually normal. Isolated premature <b>menarche</b> is rarely the first manifestation of precocious puberty.|$|E
25|$|The first menstrual {{bleeding}} {{is referred}} to as <b>menarche,</b> and typically occurs about two years after thelarche. The average age of <b>menarche</b> is 12.5 in the United States. Most American girls experience their first period at 11, 12 or 13, but some experience it earlier than their 11th birthday and others after their 14th birthday. In fact, anytime between 8 and 16 is normal. In Canada, the average age of <b>menarche</b> is 12.72, and in the United Kingdom it is 12.9. The time between menstrual periods (menses) is not always regular {{in the first two years}} after <b>menarche.</b> Ovulation is necessary for fertility, but may or may not accompany the earliest menses. In postmenarchal girls, about 80% of the cycles were anovulatory in the first year after <b>menarche,</b> 50% in the third year and 10% in the sixth year. Initiation of ovulation after <b>menarche</b> is not inevitable. A high proportion of girls with continued irregularity in the menstrual cycle several years from <b>menarche</b> will continue to have prolonged irregularity and anovulation, and are at higher risk for reduced fertility.|$|E
25|$|Where an {{underlying}} cause can be identified, treatment may {{be directed at}} this. Clearly heavy periods at <b>menarche</b> and menopause may settle spontaneously (the <b>menarche</b> being the start and menopause being the cessation of periods).|$|E
25|$|No {{specific}} {{hormonal signal}} for <b>menarche</b> is known; <b>menarche</b> as a discrete event {{is thought to}} be the relatively chance result of the gradual thickening of the endometrium induced by rising but fluctuating pubertal estrogen.|$|E
25|$|In females, {{changes in}} the primary sex {{characteristics}} involve growth of the uterus, vagina, {{and other aspects of}} the reproductive system. <b>Menarche,</b> the beginning of menstruation, is a relatively late development which follows a long series of hormonal changes. Generally, a girl is not fully fertile until several years after <b>menarche,</b> as regular ovulation follows <b>menarche</b> by about two years. Unlike males, therefore, females usually appear physically mature before they are capable of becoming pregnant.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{public schools}} have a sex {{education}} program that teaches girls about menstruation and what to expect {{at the onset of}} <b>menarche</b> (often this takes place during the 4th grade). Historically menstruation has been a social taboo and girls were taught about <b>menarche</b> and menstruation by their mothers or a female role model. Then, and to an extent now, menstruation was a private matter and a girl's <b>menarche</b> was not a community phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Adolescent girls become fertile {{following}} the <b>menarche</b> (first menstrual period), which normally occurs between age 11 to 12. After <b>menarche,</b> sexual intercourse (especially without contraception) {{can lead to}} pregnancy. The pregnant teenager may then miscarry, have an abortion, or carry the child to full term.|$|E
25|$|Another {{limitation}} of the social research is that nearly all of it has concerned girls, partly because female puberty requires greater physiologic resources and partly because it involves a unique event (<b>menarche)</b> that makes survey research into female puberty much simpler than male. More detail is provided in the <b>menarche</b> article.|$|E
25|$|For {{young women}} in many cultures, the first {{menstruation}} is a marker that signifies a change in status. Post-menarche, the young woman enters a stage called maidenhood, the stage between <b>menarche</b> and marriage. There are cultures that have in past centuries, and in present, practiced rites of passage for a girl experiencing <b>menarche.</b>|$|E
25|$|Teenage pregnancy, {{also known}} as {{adolescent}} pregnancy, is pregnancy in females {{under the age of}} 20. A female can become pregnant from sexual intercourse after she has begun to ovulate, which can be before her first menstrual period (<b>menarche)</b> but usually occurs after the onset of her periods. In well-nourished females, <b>menarche</b> usually takes place around the age of 12 or 13.|$|E
25|$|Menstruation is a {{cultural}} as well as scientific phenomenon as many societies have specific rituals and cultural norms associated with it. These rituals typically begin at <b>menarche</b> and some are enacted during each menstruation cycle. The rituals are important in determining a status change for girls. Upon <b>menarche</b> and completion of the ritual, they have become a woman as defined by their culture.|$|E
25|$|In some Indian communities, {{young women}} are given a special <b>menarche</b> {{ceremony}} called Ruthu Sadangu.|$|E
25|$|The major {{landmark}} {{of puberty}} for males is spermarche, the first ejaculation, which occurs, on average, at age 13. For females, it is <b>menarche,</b> {{the onset of}} menstruation, which occurs, on average, between ages 12 and 13. The age of <b>menarche</b> is influenced by heredity, but a girl's diet and lifestyle contribute as well. Regardless of genes, a girl must have a certain proportion of body fat to attain <b>menarche.</b> Consequently, girls who have a high-fat diet and who are not physically active begin menstruating earlier, on average, than girls whose diet contains less fat and whose activities involve fat reducing exercise (e.g. ballet and gymnastics). Girls who experience malnutrition or are in societies in which children are expected to perform physical labor also begin menstruating at later ages.|$|E
25|$|Uterine {{maturity}} {{is positively}} associated with years of estrogen use, history of spontaneous <b>menarche,</b> and negatively associated {{with the lack of}} current hormone replacement therapy.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{systemic}} {{or chronic}} illness can delay <b>menarche,</b> such as undiagnosed and untreated celiac disease (which often occurs without gastrointestinal symptoms), asthma, diabetes mellitus type 1, cystic fibrosis and inflammatory diseases, among others. In some cases, because biochemical tests {{are not always}} discriminatory, underlying pathologies are not identified and the girl is classified as constitutional growth delay. Short stature, delayed growth in height and weight, and/or delayed <b>menarche</b> {{may be the only}} clinical manifestations of celiac disease, in absence of any other symptoms.|$|E
25|$|In Nigeria, the Tiv {{ethnic group}} cut four lines into the abdomen of their girls during <b>menarche.</b> The lines are {{supposed}} to represent fertility.|$|E
25|$|When <b>menarche</b> {{has failed}} to occur for more than 3 years after thelarche, or beyond 16 years of age, the delay is {{referred}} to as primary amenorrhea.|$|E
25|$|Generally speaking, women {{raised in}} the Western world or {{developed}} countries in Asia live long enough so {{that a third of}} their life is spent in post-menopause. For some women, the menopausal transition represents a major life change, similar to <b>menarche</b> in the magnitude of its social and psychological significance. Although the significance of the changes that surround <b>menarche</b> is fairly well recognized, in countries such as the United States, the social and psychological ramifications of the menopause transition are frequently ignored or underestimated.|$|E
25|$|When a girl reaches <b>menarche,</b> she {{is held in}} the lap {{by adults}} in a ritual similar to that at birth. She is then {{partially}} secluded for some time, being covered with woven palm-leaf mats. After seclusion, she is cut with broken glass, and charcoal is rubbed into the wound to create a set of linear parallel tattoo marks. Men who have had sexual relations with her prior to <b>menarche</b> also undergo ritual purification at this time. Women keep their hair cut short and wear seed and tooth necklaces as tribal ethnic identifiers.|$|E
25|$|In most girls, <b>menarche</b> {{does not}} mean that {{ovulation}} has occurred. In postmenarchal girls, about 80% of the cycles were anovulatory in the first year after <b>menarche,</b> 50% in the third and 10% in the sixth year. Regular ovulation is usually indicated by predictable and consistent intervals between menses, predictable and consistent durations of menses, and predictable and consistent patterns of flow (e.g., heaviness or cramping). Continuing ovulation typically requires a body fat content of at least 22%. An anthropological term for this state of potential fertility is nubility.|$|E
25|$|The Nuu-chah-nulth (also {{known as}} the Nootka) believe that {{physical}} endurance {{is the most important}} quality in young women. At <b>menarche</b> the girl is taken out to sea and left there to swim back.|$|E
25|$|The {{average age}} at which the onset of puberty occurs has dropped {{significantly}} since the 1840s. In every decade from 1840 to 1950 there was a drop of four months in {{the average age of}} <b>menarche</b> among Western European females. In Norway, girls born in 1840 had their <b>menarche</b> at an average age of 17 years. In France, the average in 1840 was 15.3 years. In England, the average in 1840 was 16.5 years. In Japan the decline happened later and was then more rapid: from 1945 to 1975 in Japan there was a drop of 11 months per decade.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} part of a child's psychosocial environment is the family, and most of the social influence research has investigated features of family structure and function in relation to earlier or later female puberty. Most of the studies have reported that <b>menarche</b> may occur a few months earlier in girls in high-stress households, whose fathers are absent during their early childhood, who have a stepfather in the home, who are subjected to prolonged sexual abuse in childhood, or who are adopted from a developing country at a young age. Conversely, <b>menarche</b> may be slightly later when a girl grows up in a large family with a biological father present.|$|E
25|$|The {{average age}} at which puberty begins may be {{affected}} by race as well. For example, {{the average age of}} <b>menarche</b> in various populations surveyed has ranged from 12 to 18 years. The earliest average onset of puberty is for African-American girls and the latest average onset for high altitude subsistence populations in Asia. However, much of the higher age averages reflect nutritional limitations more than genetic differences and can change within a few generations with a substantial change in diet. The median age of <b>menarche</b> for a population may be an index of the proportion of undernourished girls in the population, and the width of the spread may reflect unevenness of wealth and food distribution in a population.|$|E
25|$|Yolk sac tumors, {{formerly}} called endodermal sinus tumors, make up approximately 10–20% {{of ovarian}} germ cell malignancies, {{and have the}} worst prognosis of all ovarian germ cell tumors. They occur both before <b>menarche</b> (in one-third of cases) and after <b>menarche</b> (the remaining two-thirds of cases). Half of people with yolk sac tumors are diagnosed in stage I. Typically, they are unilateral until metastasis, which occurs within the peritoneal cavity and via the bloodstream to the lungs. Yolk sac tumors grow quickly and recur easily, and are not easily treatable once they have recurred. Stage I yolk sac tumors are highly treatable, with a 5-year disease free survival rate of 93%, but stage II-IV tumors are less treatable, with survival rates of 64–91%.|$|E
25|$|The Ulithi {{tribe of}} Micronesia call a girl's <b>menarche</b> kufar. She {{goes to a}} menstrual house, where the women bathe her and recite spells. She will {{have to return to}} the {{menstruation}} hut every time she menstruates. Her parents build her a private hut that she will live in until she is married.|$|E
25|$|The {{sequence}} of events of pubertal development can occasionally vary. For example, in about 15% of boys and girls, pubarche (the first pubic hairs) can precede, respectively, gonadarche and thelarche by a few months. Rarely, <b>menarche</b> can occur before other signs of puberty in a few girls. These variations deserve medical evaluation because they can occasionally signal a disease.|$|E
25|$|The Mescalero Apaches place high {{importance}} on their <b>menarche</b> ceremony {{and it is}} regarded as the most important ritual in their tribe. Each year there is an eight-day event celebrating all of the girls who have menstruated in the past year. The days are split between feasting and private ceremonies reflecting on their new womanly status.|$|E
25|$|In Sri Lanka an astrologer is {{contacted}} {{to study}} the alignment of stars when the girl experiences <b>menarche</b> because {{it is believed that}} her future can be predicted. The women of the family then gather in her home and scrub her in a ritual bathing ceremony. Her family then throws a familial party at which the girl wears white and may receive gifts.|$|E
