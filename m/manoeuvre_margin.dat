40|$|The {{problem of}} {{assessing}} the handling qualities of aircraft with marginal or negative longitudinal stability is investigated. A mathematical {{model of the}} human pilot is used to study closed loop tracking {{and the results are}} checked by an experiment in a fixed base simulator. Some of the older handling qualities criteria such as <b>manoeuvre</b> <b>margin</b> and stick force per g are of limited use at marginal levels of stability but plots of pilot opinion contours against the stiffness and damping term of a second order system are useful provided the correct pair of dominant roots is chosen. However, where either root of the other'pair has a time to double amplitude less than 3. 5 set the rating from the dominant pair may be modified by consideration of multi-loop control of pitch angle, speed and height, At present this can be done reliably only by testing the particular case in a flight simulator These facts are llsed as the basis of a procedure which can be used for assessing the longitudLna $ handling qualities of aircraft even when these have marginal stability Disagreement between theoretical predictions and simlator results leads to the hypothesis that the necessity to apply phase lag has little effect on pilot opinion. This conflicts with previously accepted pilot adaptation rules...|$|E
40|$|Summary. [...] The {{general theory}} of {{longitudinal}} stability and control for a single-rotor helicopter is presented in a form similar to that for fixed-wing aircraft. It is shown to be possible to establish for the helicopter in forward flight, {{in the same way}} as for fixed-wing aircraft, stick-fixed static and manoeuvre margins, on which the stability and handling qualities depend to a marked extent. If the static margin K ~> 0 the helicopter is mathematically statically stable, and the pilot requires a forward stick displacement to hold increased speed and conversely. If the <b>manoeuvre</b> <b>margin</b> Hm> 0, the helicopter is unlikely to be subject to rapid divergence in a disturbance, and the pilot requires a backward stick displacement for positive normal acceleration in a pull-out. Theoretical relations are derived for K, ~ and H,,,, in a general form covering the case of a tailplane linked to the rotor control. Relations are given also for determining K,, and H~. ~ from measured control changes to trim. An analysis is giveia of the growth of acceleration in a pull-'out and assessment of estimated acceleration curves in terms of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics ' divergence requirement ' suggests that the latter may be satisfied if H, ~ has a small positive value. Further evidence on this point will be obtained in tests now being made on a number of helicopters to study the correlation of stability and control characteristics and pilots ' impressions of the handling qualities. Extension of the theory to stick-free longitudinal stability depends on knowledge of the rotor forces on the contro...|$|E
40|$|Summary. [...] This report {{develops}} {{an approximate}} theory of longitudinal response which {{applies to the}} slow mode of motion after a disturbance. This theory is complementary to that for the quick-period motion given by Gates and Lyon 5 (1944). It predicts the slow motions which occur after the quick-period motions ha-~e died out. The approximate equations given are of second order only and can therefore be solved algebraically. This has been done and the general solutions are given in Tables 1 and 2. Some numerical examples have been computed to indicate the accuracy which can be expected. The agreement with the first approximation is quite good and in some components it can be improved {{by the use of}} a further correction term., 1. Introductio~. [...] Recent flight and wind-tunnel tests have shown that aircraft flying in the transonic range are likely to have <b>manoeuvre</b> and static <b>margins</b> well outside the ranges which have been usual in the past and in particular that large negative static margins may occur, accompanied by moderately large positive <b>manoeuvre</b> <b>margins.</b> This condition must lead to instability of the long-period motion and it is desirable that some method should be available which enables the seriousness of this effect on the aircraft response to control movements and outside disturbances to be assessed easily. The motion of an aeroplane after a longitudinal disturbance is a mixture of two modes o...|$|R
40|$|Aims: The {{number of}} MSDs {{increased}} steadily since the 1990 ’s. Numerous interventions in workplaces, studies and symposia brought together researchers and professionals. Their intervention strategy became clearer. Companies succeed in reducing complaints and improving production, but occupational diseases and productive disorders return after thereabouts two years. This {{raises questions about}} conditions of a sustainable MSD prevention [1]. Three research teams and ANACT network conducted between 2004 and 2007 an intervention research, supported by the French Ministry in charge of labour, concerning obstacles and driving forces to implement a sustainable prevention in companies. This study provided {{a better understanding of}} practices and proposes recommendations applied to the system of prevention [2]. Methods: First, consultants led retrospective analysis in thirty industrial and service companies, {{on the basis of a}} common reference. Secondly, they accompanied eighteen volunteers in their MSD project. Their intervention strategy was recounted in a logbook and by interview. The overall analysis is based on comparison of monographs drafted on these two steps. Results: Companies are adjusting occasional and local over time, when workers suffer from MSD, without capitalize on their actions. A more proactive, collective and comprehensive approach is still rare. This trend is related to corporate governance, project management, production organization, HRM and workers’ knowledge recognition. A stable leadership is an asset unlike high turnover or limited autonomy A collective dynamics based on common references and outside opening (club, external counselling) allow a steady project. Weak internal resources, a non-shared and restrictive MSD pattern and a low involvement of staff representative bodies undermine it The prevention efforts are most effective by improving organization, but most companies are facing dislocated organizations constantly producing MSD Very few companies take into account occupational health indicators and workers’ complaints, which reveal hardness and malfunctions. This requires tools for data collection and good relations between Human Resources and occupational health. Denying workers’ difficulties is an aggravating factor of MSD. Workers need <b>manoeuvring</b> <b>margins</b> to develop a professional act, namely adapting their gestures to contexts and events production. Discuss ways and means is a promising prevention resource. Conclusion: This study offers recommendations on accompanying forms and necessary conditions to sustain companies’ involvement over time: Extend managers’ awareness through training on TMS and prevention project management; Support a mode of corporate governance in order to influence the work systems design; Strengthen prospective HRM, training and transmission of professional gesture...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes and {{demonstrates}} a spatial optimiser that allocates areas of inefficient machine <b>manoeuvring</b> to field <b>margins</b> thus improving {{the use of}} available space and supporting map-based Controlled Traffic Farming. A prototype web service (GAOS) allows farmers to optimise tracks within their fields and explore planning alternatives prior to downloading the plans to their RTK GPS-guided steering system. GAOS retrieves accurate data on field geometry from a geo-database. Via a web interface, the farmer sets options regarding operation properties, potential locations for field margins and headlands, etc. Next, an optimisation script that employs an open source geospatial library (osgeo. ogr) is called. The objective function considers costs involved with un-cropped areas, turning at headlands and subsidies received for field margins. Optimisation results are stored in a database and are available for (1) viewing via the web interface, (2) downloading to the GPS-guided steering system and (3) communication to third parties...|$|R
