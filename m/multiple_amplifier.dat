5000|$|An {{alternative}} technology, branched DNA assay, can be {{used for}} RNA (mRNA, lncRNA, and miRNA [...] ) in situ hybridization assays with single molecule sensitivity without the use of radioactivity. This approach (e.g., ViewRNA assays) {{can be used}} to visualize up to four targets in one assay, and it uses patented probe design and bDNA signal amplification to generate sensitive and specific signals. Samples (cells, tissues, and CTCs) are fixed, then treated to allow RNA target accessibility (RNA un-masking). Target-specific probes hybridize to each target RNA. Subsequent signal amplification is predicated on specific hybridization of adjacent probes (individual oligonucleotides oligos that bind side by side on RNA targets). A typical target-specific probe will contain 40 oligonucleotides, resulting in 20 oligo pairs that bind side-by-side on the target for detection of mRNA and lncRNA, and 2 oligos or a single pair for miRNA detection. Signal amplification is achieved via a series of sequential hybridization steps. A pre-amplifier molecule hybridizes to each oligo pair on the target-specific RNA, then <b>multiple</b> <b>amplifier</b> molecules hybridize to each pre-amplifier. Next, multiple label probe oligonucleotides (conjugated to alkaline phosphatase or directly to fluorophores) hybridize to each amplifier molecule. A fully assembled signal amplification structure “Tree” has 400 binding sites for the label probes. When all target-specific probes bind to the target mRNA transcript, an 8,000 fold signal amplification occurs for that one transcript. Separate but compatible signal amplification systems enable the multiplex assays. The signal can be visualized using a fluorescence or brightfield microscope.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{develop a}} {{framework}} that supports impair-ment-aware lightpath routing and wavelength assignments in optical transport networks. Different from most existing studies, we consider a more generic optical transport network with phys-ical-layer heterogeneity, including different fiber types, variable amplification span distances and attenuation coefficients. In addition, rather than a single amplifier type as {{in most of the}} existing studies, we consider <b>multiple</b> <b>amplifier</b> types for different amplification situations. Owing to the high cost of OEO regen-eration, the total number of required regenerators is considered as the major objective for optimization. A signal-quality-aware routing algorithm is developed to find routes that are expected to require the fewest regenerators. The first-fit wavelength assign-ment algorithm is extended to assign wavelength(s) for lightpaths after placement of some regenerators which can freely function as wavelength converters. Simulation studies indicate that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the required number of regenerators compared to the simple shortest-path routing algorithm. Moreover, it is found that the signal-quality-aware algorithm shows stronger benefits when a network demonstrates higher physical-layer heterogeneity such as different fiber types and non-uniform span losses. The signal-quality-aware algorithm also demonstrates better performance when a network has a higher average nodal degree. Finally, the results indicate that <b>multiple</b> <b>amplifier</b> options are important for cost-effective optical transport network design. For a network with high physical-layer heterogeneity, <b>multiple</b> <b>amplifier</b> options can significantly reduce the required number of regenerators (up to 50 %) over a single amplifier option.

40|$|Compact {{amplifier}} assemblies {{of a type}} {{now being}} developed for operation at frequencies of hundreds of gigahertz comprise <b>multiple</b> <b>amplifier</b> units in parallel arrangements to increase power and/or cascade arrangements to increase gains. Each amplifier unit is a {{monolithic microwave integrated circuit}} (MMIC) implementation of a pair of amplifiers in differential (in contradistinction to single-ended) configuration. Heretofore, in cascading amplifiers to increase gain, it has been common practice to interconnect the amplifiers by use of wires and/or thin films on substrates. This practice has not yielded satisfactory results at frequencies greater than 200 Hz, in each case, for either or both of two reasons: Wire bonds introduce large discontinuities. Because the interconnections are typically tens of wavelengths long, any impedance mismatches give rise to ripples in the gain-vs. -frequency response, which degrade the performance of the cascade...|$|E
40|$|Glass fusion laser systems {{typically}} use {{a master}} oscillator-power amplifier (MOPA) architecture, where {{control of the}} optical pulse temporal and spatial parameters is accomplished mainly in the master oscillator and low power optics. The pulses from this low power ``front end`` are amplified in the power amplifier, which modifies the pulse shape temporally and spatially. Nonlinear frequency conversion crystals following the amplifier further change the pulse before it reaches the target. To effectively control the optical pulse on target for different types of experiments, and compensate for nonlinearity in the preceding optics, the front end system must be versatile enough to easily control many pulse parameters over a large range. The front end pulse generation system {{described in this article}} represents a new approach to this problem. The proposed National Ignition Facility (NIF) has 192 beamlines, each of which requires an input pulse of up to 12 Joules in around 4 ns equivalent square pulse length. Considerations of laser architecture for supplying each of these beamlines from a central oscillator system were crucial {{in the design of the}} front end. Previous lasers have used bulk optics to split a single oscillator signal and report beams to <b>multiple</b> <b>amplifier</b> chains. A key idea in the current design is to replace bulk optic transport with fibers, eliminating large opto-mechanical subsystems. Another important concept is convenient pulse forming using low voltage integrated optic modulators. The integrated optic and fiber optic concepts resulted in the current pulse generation designs for NEF. An important advantage is that each of the beamlines can have an independently controlled temporal pulse shape, which provides for precise balance of instantaneous power on target...|$|E
40|$|Dielectric Er 3 +- and Nd 3 +-doped {{waveguide}} materials offer broad {{gain in the}} third, second, {{and first}} telecommunication windows. Rare-earth-ion-doped Al 2 O 3 has broad emission spectra for gain over a wider wavelength range, a high refractive index contrast which allows tighter bend radii and more compact devices, and can be deposited {{on a number of}} common substrates, including thermally oxidized Si wafers. This opens the possibility for integration of Al 2 O 3 directly with photonic materials which are optimized for passive waveguiding functions. In this contribution we present recent results demonstrating the high performance of Er 3 +- and Nd 3 +-doped Al 2 O 3 integrated optical amplifiers. Rare-earth-ion-doped Al 2 O 3 layers were deposited onto thermally oxidized Si wafers by reactive co-sputtering and channel waveguides were microstructured by chlorine-based reactive ion etching. We developed Al 2 O 3 :Er 3 + amplifiers with up to 2. 0 dB/cm net gain at 1533 nm and gain over an 80 -nm bandwidth, among others enabling loss-less power splitters over the entire telecom C-band, and demonstrated 170 -Gbit/s signal transmission in an integrated Al 2 O 3 :Er 3 + amplifier. In Al 2 O 3 :Nd 3 + amplifiers, net gain of 6. 3 dB/cm at 1064 nm and 1. 93 dB/cm at 1330 nm, {{as well as in the}} range 865 - 930 nm with a peak gain of 1. 57 dB/cm at 880 nm was obtained. Monolithic integration of Al 2 O 3 :Er 3 + amplifiers with passive silicon-on-insulator waveguides was demonstrated and a signal enhancement of > 7 dB at 1533 nm wavelength was obtained. The straightforward wafer-scale fabrication process allows for parallel integration of <b>multiple</b> <b>amplifier</b> and laser sections with silicon or other photonic circuits on a chip. Furthermore, a solution for compensating losses in optical interconnects is provided. Large-core Al 2 O 3 :Nd 3 + channel waveguide amplifiers were tested in combination with passive polymer waveguides. Coupling between the two waveguide types was optimized and tapering the Al 2 O 3 :Nd 3 + waveguide improved the pump intensity in the active region. 0. 21 dB net gain at 880 nm was demonstrated in a structure with an Al 2 O 3 :Nd 3 + waveguide coupled between two polymer waveguides. In spectroscopic investigations, the influence of energy migration and energy-transfer upconversion (ETU) among neighboring Er 3 + ions on luminescence decay in Al 2 O 3 :Er 3 + was investigated. We observed a fast quenching process induced by, e. g., active ion pairs and clusters, undesired impurities, or host material defects such as voids. This process was verified by pump-absorption experiments, but was not revealed by any particular signature in the luminescence decay curves. This result highlights the fact that spectroscopic processes can be – and in many cases probably are – present in optical materials, although these processes are invisible in any kind of luminescence measurements, because they do not lead to the emission of a photon. On the other hand, we show that these processes strongly affect device performance as an amplifier...|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} problem with using <b>multiple</b> guitar <b>{{amplifiers}}</b> {{is that the}} phase of the amplifiers does not always line up. If the two amplifiers are 180° out of phase, then the sound will be very thin sounding. Most of the time, this can be fixed by reversing the polarity on the connection between one of the amplifiers and that amplifiers speaker. However there are units such as the radial phazer that can provide a more exact alignment of phase. Another common problem with using <b>multiple</b> guitar <b>amplifiers</b> {{is that it can}} cause ground loops. Ground loops happen when <b>multiple</b> <b>amplifiers</b> are running off of the same AC power source. Signal gets from one amplifier to the other through the ground connection and causes a loud hum. The most simple way around this is to simply use a three-prong to two-prong adapter on one of the amplifiers. This lifts the ground connection and breaks the loop. To avoid the safety hazard of lifting the ground on a high-powered amplifier, a lot of people use transformers to isolate the signals going to the amplifiers to solve the ground loop problem. This is much more expensive but safer.|$|R

Here, we address this shortcoming by demonstrating multiplexed northern blotting based on the mechanism of hybridization chain reaction (HCR). With this approach, nucleic acid probes complementary to RNA targets trigger chain reactions in which fluorophore-labeled DNA hairpins self-assemble into tethered fluorescent amplification polymers.
