2500|$|Amongst {{the various}} {{contemporary}} agricultural practices {{mentioned in the}} Nong Shu, Wang listed and described the use of ploughing, sowing, irrigation, cultivation of mulberries, etc. It listed and described many of the various foodstuffs and products of the many regions of China. The book outlined the use of not only agricultural tools, but food-processing, irrigation equipment, different types of fields, ceremonial vessels, various types of grain storage, carts, boats, mechanical devices, and textile machinery used in many applications. [...] For example, {{one of the many}} devices described and illustrated in drawing is a large <b>mechanical</b> <b>milling</b> plant operated by the motive power of oxen, with an enormous rotating geared wheel engaging the toothed gears of eight different mills surrounding it. Of great interest to sinologist historians, Wang also outlined the difference between the agricultural technology of Northern China and that of Southern China. The main characteristic of agricultural technology of the north was technical applications fit for predominantly dryland cultivation, while intensified irrigation cultivation was more suitable for southern China. Furthermore, Wang used his treatise as a means to spread knowledge in support of certain agricultural practices or technologies found exclusively in either South or North that could benefit the other, if only they were more widely known, such as the southern hand-harrow used for weeding in the south, yet virtually unknown in the north.|$|E

50|$|A method {{with similar}} {{advantages}} to <b>mechanical</b> <b>milling</b> is laser etching and laser drilling. Etching PCBs with lasers offers the same advantages as <b>mechanical</b> <b>milling</b> {{in regards to}} quick turnaround times, but {{the nature of the}} laser etching process is preferable to both milling and chemical etching when it comes to physical variations exerted on the object. Whereas <b>mechanical</b> <b>milling</b> and chemical etching exact physical stress on the board, laser etching offers non-contact surface removal, making it a superior option for PCBs where precision and geometric accuracy are at a premium, such as RF & microwave designs.Laser drilling is more precise, has extremely low power consumption compared with other techniques, requires less maintenance, does not use lubricants or drill bits, low rates of wear, does not use abrasive materials, does not ruin the boards, is more eco friendly, and in the most high-powered machines, the drilling is instant, but is expensive.|$|E
50|$|Cryomilling is a {{variation}} of <b>mechanical</b> <b>milling,</b> in which metallic powders or other samples (e.g. temperature sensitive samples and samples with volatile components) are milled in a cryogen (usually liquid nitrogen or liquid argon) slurry or at a cryogenics temperature under processing parameters, so a nanostructured microstructure is attained. Cryomilling takes advantage of both the cryogenic temperatures and conventional <b>mechanical</b> <b>milling.</b> The extremely low milling temperature suppresses recovery and recrystallization and leads to finer grain structures and more rapid grain refinement. The embrittlement of the sample makes even elastic and soft samples grindable. Tolerances less than 5 µm can be achieved. The ground material can be analyzed by a laboratory analyzer.|$|E

50|$|Another {{method for}} the {{synthesis}} of UHTCs is the borothermic reduction of ZnO2, TiO2, or HfO2 with B. At temperatures higher than 1600 °C, pure diborides {{can be obtained from}} this method. Due to the loss of some boron as boron oxide, excess boron is needed during borothermic reduction. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>milling</b> can lower the reaction temperature required during borothermic reduction. This is due to the increased particle mixing and lattice defects that result from decreased particle sizes of ZnO2 and B after milling. This method is also not very useful for industrial applications due to the loss of expensive boron as boron oxide during the reaction.|$|E
50|$|When a {{composite}} repair is applied the proper surface treatment {{is essential for}} a successful result. The above-mentioned repairs can be time consuming and often require high skills and experience to be performed. This is why current developments {{tend to focus on}} automating this process either by advanced <b>mechanical</b> <b>milling</b> or alternate technologies like nanosecond-pulsed lasers 2-3. After the damage zone has been completely excavated, surfaces are cleaned and further prepared for the final repair by patches. This can be done by plasma burning of surface contaminants, exposing fibres by removing matrix material through laser radiation or improving the surface wettability for adhesives by photochemical reactions induced by UV-laser light 4.|$|E

Sometimes a CTMP mill is located on the same site as a kraft mill so that the effluent from the CTMP mill can be treated in the kraft recovery process to regenerate the inorganic pulping chemicals.|$|R
50|$|Psyllium is {{produced}} mainly for its mucilage content. The term mucilage describes {{a group of}} clear, colorless, gelling agents derived from plants. The mucilage obtained from psyllium comes from the seed coat. Mucilage is obtained by <b>mechanical</b> <b>milling</b> (i.e. grinding) of the outer layer of the seed. Mucilage yield amounts to about 25% (by weight) of the total seed yield. Plantago-seed mucilage {{is often referred to}} as husk, or psyllium husk. The milled seed mucilage is a white fibrous material that is hydrophilic, meaning that its molecular structure causes it to attract and bind to water. Upon absorbing water, the clear, colorless, mucilaginous gel that forms increases in volume by tenfold or more.|$|E
50|$|While {{the model}} was {{developed}} specifically for <b>mechanical</b> <b>milling,</b> {{it has also been}} successfully applied to other SPD processes. Frequently only a portion of the model is used (typically the term involving the stacking fault energy) as the other terms are often unknown and difficult to measure. This is still useful as it implies that all other things remaining equal, reducing the stacking fault energy, a property that {{is a function of the}} alloying elements, will allow for better grain refinement. A few studies, however, suggested that despite the significance of stacking fault energy on the grain refinement at the early stages of straining, the steady-state grain size at large strains is mainly controlled by the homologous temperature in pure metals and by the interaction of solute atoms and dislocations in single-phase alloys.|$|E
50|$|As a {{first step}} of {{processing}} finger millet can be milled to produce flour. However, finger millet is difficult to mill due to {{the small size of}} the seeds and because the bran is bound very tightly to the endosperm. Furthermore, the delicate seed can get crushed during the milling. The development of commercial <b>mechanical</b> <b>milling</b> systems for finger millet is challenging. Therefore, the main product of finger millet is whole grain flour. This has disadvantages, such as reduced storage time of the flour due to the high oil content. Furthermore, the industrial use of whole grain finger millet flour is limited. Recently a new milling system was developed in India, which is able to grind finger millet grains. This milling system is called Mini Millet Mill. The Mini Millet Mill takes into account the traditional knowledge of the farmers and moistens the seeds half an hour before grinding. Moistening the millet seeds prior to grinding helps to remove the bran mechanically without causing damage {{to the rest of the}} seed. The mini millet mill can also be used to process other grains such as wheat and sorghum. The Mini Millet Mill could be promising as it yields white flour which can be commercially used.|$|E

50|$|A sawmill or lumber mill is a {{facility}} where logs are cut into lumber. Before {{the invention of}} the sawmill, boards were made in various manual ways, either rived (split) and planed, hewn, or more often hand sawn by two men with a whipsaw, one above and another in a saw pit below. The earliest known <b>mechanical</b> <b>mill</b> is the Hierapolis sawmill, a Roman water-powered stone mill at Hierapolis, Asia Minor dating back to the 3rd century AD. Other water-powered mills followed and by the 11th century they were widespread in Spain and North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, and in the next few centuries, spread across Europe. The circular motion of the wheel was converted to a reciprocating motion at the saw blade. Generally, only the saw was powered, and the logs had to be loaded and moved by hand. An early improvement was the development of a movable carriage, also water powered, to move the log steadily through the saw blade.|$|R
