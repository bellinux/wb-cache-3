25|$|Following a {{decision}} of the Berlin House of Representatives, the goal is essentially to restore the S-Bahn network to its extent in 1961. This was stated in an agreement between Deutsche Bahn, the Federal Ministry of Transport and the Senate on 4 November 1993. The network was to be restored by 2002. On this basis, the plans {{were included in the}} land use plan of 1995. In a study of the transport development by the then Department for Transport and Commerce in 1995, a plan was published for a network. Only the Jungfernheide–Stresow, Spandau–Staaken and Zehlendorf–Düppel sections, which had existed until 1980, were not incorporated in these plans. This political commitment is now only symbolic as some projects are now aimed at points beyond the original destinations or to <b>miss</b> <b>them</b> entirely. Budgetary difficulties, changing traffic flows and alternative development projects using Regionalbahn trains have led to the cancellation or postponement of projects that had already been developed.|$|E
25|$|Angry at Ian, the Doctor {{tries to}} take him and Barbara home, but in The Reign of Terror they {{end up in the}} French Revolution, where Barbara and Susan are {{captured}} and nearly guillotined. In the second season opener, Planet of Giants (1964), the TARDIS crew are miniaturised and Barbara becomes infected by a deadly insecticide. Barbara sees the departure of Susan and aids in the rescue of the abandoned orphan Vicki (Maureen O'Brien), who takes Susan's place on the TARDIS. In the subsequent adventure, The Romans, Barbara is sold off as a slave and ends up as a servant in Nero's palace; due to his interest in her, Nero's wife Poppaea tries to poison her. Barbara and Ian leave in The Chase (1965). After the Daleks who have been pursuing the TARDIS have been destroyed, Barbara suggests to Ian they use the abandoned Dalek time machine to get home. The Doctor is furious and tries to persuade them to stay with him by suggesting the journey might kill them, but the two teachers had made up their minds. After an emotional farewell to the Doctor and Vicki, Barbara and Ian are returned to London, albeit two years after their disappearance. Back on the TARDIS, the Doctor uses the time-space visualiser to check they have returned safely, and tells Vicki how much he will <b>miss</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were negative. Television Without Pity writer Jessica Morgan {{rated the}} episode a B−. Sarah Stegall awarded the episode five stars {{out of five}} and noted [...] "Being dead has done wonders for Fox Mulder." [...] Stegall {{concluded}} that the episode [...] "is {{one of the best}} episodes of the new era. Mulder and Scully get one last chance to remind us why we will <b>miss</b> <b>them,</b> and Doggett and Reyes get a chance to earn their stripes. [...] If this is the season where the torch gets passed, it's good to see that it's got one last flare in it." ...|$|E

She lives by herself in Prabhadevi, a neighbourhood in Mumbai, and admits to missing the presence of her family there. She says, [...] "I <b>miss</b> <b>them,</b> but luckily I have a life of my own, which keeps me from getting homesick. I wouldn’t want them to uproot their lives from Bengaluru just to be with me." [...] A practicing Hindu, Padukone considers religion to be an important aspect of her life and makes frequent visits to temples and other religious shrines.|$|E
500|$|Sue's {{absence from}} the episode was applauded by Bell, who called it [...] "exactly what the show needed". Michael Slezak of TVLine said [...] "the show might be at its best" [...] when Sue and Will [...] "are relegated to benchwarmer status", and Poniewozik [...] "did not <b>miss</b> <b>them</b> one bit". The new Warbler, Sebastian, {{was said to be}} [...] "instantly loathsome" [...] by Benigno. His scene with Blaine that was blended with Santana and Rachel singing [...] "A Boy Like That" [...] was {{variously}} described as [...] "savvily intercut" [...] by Hyman, [...] "heavy-handed" [...] by Votta, and bringing [...] "the dangers of teen love" [...] to [...] "ferocious life" [...] by Slezak.|$|E
500|$|The {{filming of}} the music video for [...] "What You Want" [...] started on July 30, 2011 in a {{warehouse}} in [...] Brooklyn, New York, and it was directed by Meiert Avis. The video featured the band's fans who played a crowd on a concert by Evanescence. During an interview, Lee revealed that the music video for the song {{was one of the}} band's [...] "realest" [...] videos adding, [...] " [...] this is more a personal video. We've done a lot in the past that [...] very 'fantasy,' and this is sort of the real us. I just wanted to do something that really felt personal for a change. Obviously, I'm wearing crazy makeup, and that's not my everyday, but, you know, I want ... to connect with the fans again. We all do. We <b>miss</b> <b>them.</b> A lot of this record is about them, and that's why they're going to be here and be in it, too." [...] In an interview with MTV News, she described the concept of the video: ...|$|E

500|$|Rick Porter of Zap2It.com {{praised the}} writing of the episode, as well as the acting of Mindy Kaling and Jenna Fischer. [...] Porter also praised the final scene of the episode, when Jan and Michael drive home after the day. [...] Porter stated [...] "I don't know whether to laugh or turn away in shame from that final scene, though, as they bicker about what to eat while they're driving home. It was like {{watching}} two friends fight – fascinating and incredibly uncomfortable at the same time." [...] Christine Fenno, of Entertainment Weekly, stated The Deposition' was a simmering slow cooker of corporate intrigue, flavored by Michael Scott's ridiculousness, with spicy smack talk on the side." [...] Fenno, like Porter, also praised the acting of Jenna Fischer, saying that she [...] "stole the low-key opening scenes". [...] Travis Fickett, of IGN, stated that [...] "this happens to be the best episode of the season {{and one of the best}} episodes of the series. It's almost as if the writers planned it this way – to emphasize their importance and remind us how much we'll <b>miss</b> <b>them</b> when they're gone." [...] Fickett went on to praise the acting between Steve Carell (Michael) and Paul Lieberstein (Toby). [...] BuddyTV Senior Writer Oscar Dahl stated that the episode was an oddity among the series, saying [...] "The Deposition" [...] was an atypical episode of The Office, one that basically put the character of Michael Scott on trial and humiliated him over and over again." ...|$|E

When Cao Pi and Lady Zhen's children returned to Ye in late 217 after the campaign, Lady Bian's attendants were {{surprised to see that}} Lady Zhen was very cheerful.

2500|$|Analog meters {{are older}} designs, but still {{preferred}} by many engineers. One {{reason for this}} is that analog meters are more sensitive to changes in the circuit that is being measured. A digital multimeter samples the quantity being measured and then displays it. Analog multimeters continuously read the test value. If there are slight changes in readings, the needle of an analog multimeter will track them while digital multimeters may <b>miss</b> <b>them</b> or be difficult to read. This continuous tracking feature becomes important when testing capacitors or coils. A properly functioning capacitor should allow current to flow when voltage is applied, then the current slowly decreases to zero and this [...] "signature" [...] is easy to see on an analog multimeter but not on a digital multimeter. This is similar when testing a coil, except the current starts low and increases.|$|E
2500|$|Thereafter, Cuvier {{performed}} a pioneering research study on some elephant fossils excavated around Paris. [...] The bones he studied, however, were remarkably {{different from the}} bones of elephants currently thriving in India and Africa. [...] This discovery led Cuvier to denounce the idea that fossils came from those that are currently living. [...] The idea that these bones belonged to elephants living - but hiding - somewhere on Earth seemed ridiculous to Cuvier {{because it would be}} nearly impossible to <b>miss</b> <b>them</b> due to their enormous size. [...] He later performed more research studies on fossils of large animals and came to the same conclusion that the fossils simply didn’t match any living today. [...] Ultimately, his findings drove Cuvier to the proposition that the abrupt changes the Earth underwent {{over a long period of}} time caused some species to go extinct.|$|E
