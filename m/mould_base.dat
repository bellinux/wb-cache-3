40|$|Today, {{the time}} to market for metal casting {{products}} is becoming shorter, thus the lead time available for making the wax injection mould is decreasing. There is potential for timesaving in the mould design stage. This paper presents {{the basic structure of}} an interactive knowledge based wax injection mould design system. The basic of this system arises from an analysis of the wax injection mould design process for mould design companies. This wax injection mould design system covers both the mould design process and <b>mould</b> <b>base</b> standardization. In this system, the graphic module and the knowledge based module for generating mould features are integrated within an interactive Mold Wizard platform, Unigraphics system. This ensures that both speeds up the wax injection mould design process, without the need to redesign the <b>mould</b> <b>base</b> layout. With this capability, metal casting product could be designed quickly, cheaply with quality and competitively...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} artificial intelligence in the process planning of plastic injection mould bases. The com-puter-aided process-planning system, developed for IMOLD will extract and identify the operations required for machining. These operations are considered together with their precedence constraints and the available machines before the process plan for the <b>mould</b> <b>base</b> plate is generated. The process plan is optimised by a branch and bound based algorithm. Overall machining time has been proposed as the objective function for optimisation. The ability of this algorithm to search intelli-gently for a feasible optimised solution is illustrated by an industrial case study. A brief comparison with a genetic algor-ithm based process planning system is also made. The result of this development will allow users to optimise process plans easily for any given <b>mould</b> <b>base,</b> with options to suit dynamic changes on the manufacturing shop floor...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} {{a new type}} of feature, associative assembly design feature. Its concept, imple-mentation, and application are introduced. This new feature allows the following associations: (1) between parts that have not been defined geometrically; (2) between geo-metric entities defining interfaces between parts; and (3) between part geometry and intermediate geometry used to define a part. The associations can be geometric or non-geometric. Our extension to traditional assembly feature properties allows product architectures to be defined using features. These architectures, in turn, can be used to constrain the modular design of assembly geometry. The application is a <b>mould</b> <b>base</b> library for injection mould design...|$|E

40|$|Process {{design of}} {{injection}} moulding involves {{the selection of}} the injection moulding machine, mould design, production scheduling, cost estimation, and determination of injection moulding parameters. An expert system approach has been rued to derive the process solution for injection moulding over the past few years. However, this approach is found to be incapable of determining the injection moulding parameters owing to the fragile nature of the knowledge for setting the moulding parameters. In addition, the existing expert systems for process design lack proper architecture for organising heterogeneous knowledge sources. In this paper, the organising of a blackboard-based expert system and a case-based reasoning approach is introduced to eliminate the deficiency of the existing expert-system approach to process design, from which a computational system for the process design of injection moulding, named CSPD, has been developed; CSPD first derives the process solution including {{the selection of the}} injection moulding machine and the <b>mould</b> <b>base,</b> tooling cost, processing cost estimation, and production scheduling based on the blackboard-based expert-system approach.

40|$|An Oil filter is {{a filter}} to remove {{contaminants}} from engine oil, transmission oil, lubricating oil, or hydraulic oil. Oil filters {{are used in}} {{many different types of}} hydraulic machinery. A chief use of the oil filter is in internal-combustion engines in on- and off-road motor vehicles, light aircraft, and various naval vessels. Other vehicle hydraulic systems, such as those in automatic transmissions and power steering, are often equipped with an oil filter. Gas turbine engines, such as those on jet aircraft, require the use of oil filters. And oil production, transport, and recycling facilities employ filters. Parts of the hydraulic oil filter in our project are piston housing, shaft housing, top plate, crankshaft, and piston. The aim of the project is to model and design casting tool for piston housing which is used in a hydraulic oil filter pump having pressure 50 kg/cm 2, and temperature rating 300 deg C. In casting tool, we are designing core cavity, <b>mould</b> <b>base</b> plates. Calculations are to be done for cavity fill time, cavity fill rate, gate area, runner area, shot weight, die cooling calculations.

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: Journal of Engineering Manufacture [© IMechE]. It is also available at: [URL] demand for productivity and shape complexity on the injection moulding industry necessitates new research to improve tool design, material, and manufacturing. A research field is the development of functionally graded materials (FGMs) to build injection moulds. For example, moulds built with the FGMs technique can have distinctive regions with higher heat conduction. Higher rates of heat transfers from thicker regions of the injected part can be useful to produce better and cheaper injection moulded polymer parts. It is possible to obtain moulds with differential conductivity by adding locally, during the fabrication of the mould, copper to the <b>mould</b> <b>base</b> material such as tool steel. In this work, an investigation into the effect of FGM copper (Cu) -tool steel mould insert over polymer injected parts is presented. The work is divided in two parts: a numerical thermal analysis comparison between Cu-tool steel graded and tool steel inserts and an injection moulding experiment with comparisons between mould surface temperature and degree of crystallinity of polypropylene parts. The numerical model was used to compare different behaviour of the mould heat transfer according to the mould insert material. Thereafter, a bolster was built to hold FGMs and tool steel inserts obtained by a selective laser fusion process. Polypropylene was injected over the inserts to compare with the numeric results. To observe the effect of the cooling rate in the polypropylene parts using the graded inserts, the degree of crystallinity of the parts was measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) test. The temperature of the mould was also evaluated during the injection cycles. The results showed that the graded Cu-tool steel inserts tested had lower capacity to store heat energy. As Cu was added to the tool steel, the mixture proved to transfer heat more efficiently but it had less capacity to absorb heat...|$|E
40|$|In this research, a rapid {{tool for}} low volume {{production}} {{plastic injection moulding}} is designed, developed, and tested on an injection moulding machine. The tool is designed as a cavity insert of injection mould for plastic parts by an indirect rapid tooling approach. The plastic part is modelled in a CAD system and then built using a Perfactory rapid prototyping (RP) technique. Then a layer of nickel-phosphorous alloy is deposited on the prototype by electroless plating. This nickel plated RP model is then used as a casting pattern. A cavity insert, which is produced by using aluminium filled epoxy resin with the nickel plated casting pattern, is fabricated in a <b>mould</b>	<b>base</b> for injection moulding. Experimental testing on the cavity insert using an injection moulding machine show that the tool is producing quality parts without any noticeable deterioration of the surface. The number of shots completed using the cavity insert is more than 600. Applying electroless nickel plating on the casting pattern made of rapid prototyping material was successful. It was found that pre-treatment processes are crucial. In addition, the rapid prototyping material cannot be plated with nickel without palladium activation and stannous sensitising. Results show that the deposited layer is uniform and composed of both nickel and phosphorous. The surface properties of the nickel and phosphorous deposit enhance the plated layer performance due to their low surface roughness and high lubrication characteristics. Moreover, the nickel-phosphorous layer also improves the surface hardness of the cavity insert since it is left on the cavity after {{the removal of the}} casting pattern. The cavity insert was installed on an industrial injection moulding machine for trials. Results show that the cavity insert performs well with Polyethylene at 170 ˚C at an injection pressure in the range of 80 ~ 100 bar. There are no signs of wear and tear on the cavity insert up to 620 shots. However, when the injection pressure is over 120 bar, cracks start developing in the cavity insert followed by catastrophic fracture. This research has shown that manufacturing an indirect rapid tooling using electroless nickel plating for low volume production of plastic injection mouldings is feasible for Perfactory produced RP models. The cavity insert can be fabricated using commonly available low cost materials within 48 hours...|$|E
