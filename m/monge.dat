5|$|Immortalité almost reached safety. On {{the morning}} of 20 October, Captain Jean-François Legrand was {{approaching}} Brest when he was spotted by Captain Thomas Byam Martin of HMS Fisgard. Fisgard, part of the inshore squadron of the Brest blockade, immediately offered battle. Immortalité initially attempted to flee but was forced to engage the faster Fisgard at 11:00. During the bitter, close–range action, Fisgard took severe damage and almost lost her opponent. Immortalité, which had lost a mast and was in a sinking condition, surrendered at 15:00. Among the 115 casualties aboard Immortalité were Captain Legrand, his first lieutenant and General <b>Monge</b> (commander of the 250 soldiers on board), all dead. Fisgard, {{with the aid of}} other ships of the blockade squadron, successfully brought her prize into port.|$|E
5|$|Instead, the {{commission}} – whose members included Lagrange, Laplace, <b>Monge</b> and Condorcet – {{decided that the}} new measure should be equal to one ten-millionth of {{the distance from the}} North Pole to the Equator (the quadrant of the Earth's circumference), measured along the meridian passing through Paris. Apart from the obvious nationalistic considerations, the Paris meridian was also a sound choice for practical scientific reasons: a portion of the quadrant from Dunkerque to Barcelona (about 1000km, or one-tenth of the total) could be surveyed with start- and end-points at sea level, and that portion was roughly {{in the middle of the}} quadrant, where the effects of the Earth's oblateness were expected to be the largest.|$|E
5|$|In late 1915, the Austro-Hungarian Navy began {{a series}} of raids against the {{merchant}} ships supplying Allied forces in Serbia and Montenegro. On the night of 22/23 November 1915, Helgoland, Saida, and the 1st Torpedo Division raided the Albanian coast and sank a pair of Italian transports carrying flour. To facilitate these raids, Helgoland, her sister , six modern Tátra-class destroyers, six 250t-class T-group torpedo boats and an oiler were transferred to Cattaro to facilitate further raids on 29 November. Helgoland, together with five destroyers, participated in another of these raids at the end of December. On the night of 28/29 December 1915, while making her sortie, Helgoland rammed and sank the French submarine <b>Monge</b> between Brindisi and the Albanian port of Durazzo. Helgoland and the destroyers attacked shipping in Durazzo the following morning. Two of the destroyers struck mines while after sinking several ships in the port and had to be abandoned. The Austro-Hungarians managed to evade the Allied pursuit only when darkness fell. On the night of 31 May/1 June 1916, the ship covered a raid by two destroyers and three torpedo boats on the drifters defending the Strait of Otranto against submarines trying to exit the Adriatic Sea, sinking one.|$|E

5|$|Mathematics can {{be discerned}} {{in many of}} the arts, such as music, dance, painting, architecture, and sculpture. Each of these is richly {{associated}} with mathematics. Among the connections to the visual arts, mathematics can provide tools for artists, such as the rules of linear perspective as described by Brook Taylor and Johann Lambert, or the methods of descriptive geometry, now applied in software modelling of solids, dating back to Albrecht Dürer and Gaspard <b>Monge.</b> Artists from Luca Pacioli in the Middle Ages and Leonardo da Vinci and Albrecht Dürer in the Renaissance have made use of and developed mathematical ideas in the pursuit of their artistic work. The use of perspective began, despite some embryonic usages in the architecture of Ancient Greece, with Italian painters such as Giotto in the 13th century; rules such as the vanishing point were first formulated by Brunelleschi in about 1413, his theory influencing Leonardo and Dürer. Isaac Newton's work on the optical spectrum influenced Goethe's Theory of Colours and in turn artists such as Philipp Otto Runge, J. M. W. Turner, the Pre-Raphaelites and Wassily Kandinsky. Artists may also choose to analyse the symmetry of a scene. Tools may be applied by mathematicians who are exploring art, or artists inspired by mathematics, such as M. C. Escher (inspired by H. S. M. Coxeter) and the architect Frank Gehry, who more tenuously argued that computer aided design enabled him to express himself in a wholly new way.|$|E

25|$|Gaspard <b>Monge</b> found {{a center}} {{that exists in}} every {{tetrahedron}}, {{now known as the}} <b>Monge</b> point: the point where the six midplanes of a tetrahedron intersect. A midplane is defined as a plane that is orthogonal to an edge joining any two vertices that also contains the centroid of an opposite edge formed by joining the other two vertices. If the tetrahedron's altitudes do intersect, then the <b>Monge</b> point and the orthocenter coincide to give the class of orthocentric tetrahedron.|$|E

25|$|The French University model {{lacked the}} freedom of the German model, {{consisting}} of severe discipline and control over the curriculum, awarding of degrees, conformity of views, and personal habits (for example, there was a ban on beards in 1852). French university professors trained at the École Normale Supérieure, and much of their prestige depended on their schools’ reputations. By 1866, though, the German model had begun to influence the strict French model. Polytechnique was established in 1794 by the mathematician Gaspard <b>Monge</b> during the French Revolution, and became a military academy under Napoleon I in 1804.

25|$|A {{line segment}} joining a vertex of a {{tetrahedron}} with the centroid {{of the opposite}} face is called a median and a line segment joining the midpoints of two opposite edges is called a bimedian of the tetrahedron. Hence there are four medians and three bimedians in a tetrahedron. These seven line segments are all concurrent at a point called the centroid of the tetrahedron. In addition the four medians are divided in a 3:1 ratio by the centroid (see Commandino's theorem). The centroid of a tetrahedron is the midpoint between its <b>Monge</b> point and circumcenter. These points define the Euler line of the tetrahedron that {{is analogous to the}} Euler line of a triangle.|$|E

In the six years before Pascal's 1929 death, Fondane left Gourmont's house and, with his sister and brother-in-law, moved into a succession of houses (on Rue Domat, Rue Jacob, Rue <b>Monge),</b> before settling into a historical building once inhabited by author Bernardin de Saint-Pierre (Rue Rollin, 6).

25|$|The center T of the {{twelve-point}} sphere also {{lies on the}} Euler line. Unlike its triangular counterpart, {{this center}} lies {{one third of the}} way from the <b>Monge</b> point M towards the circumcenter. Also, an orthogonal line through T to a chosen face is coplanar with two other orthogonal lines to the same face. The first is an orthogonal line passing through the corresponding Euler point to the chosen face. The second is an orthogonal line passing through the centroid of the chosen face. This orthogonal line through the twelve-point center lies midway between the Euler point orthogonal line and the centroidal orthogonal line. Furthermore, for any face, the twelve-point center lies at the midpoint of the corresponding Euler point and the orthocenter for that face.|$|E
