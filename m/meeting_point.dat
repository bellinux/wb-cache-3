5|$|While {{progressing}} {{through the}} game, the player can {{take control of}} three different characters: Juno, Vela, and Lupus. Each character has a special ability {{that allows them to}} uncover areas which the other characters cannot reach. Juno can walk through magma safely, Vela can swim underwater indefinitely, and Lupus can hover {{for a short period of}} time. Therefore, choosing the right character for the right stage is critical in order to complete the game. Initially, the game forces the player to use the three characters individually until they reach a <b>meeting</b> <b>point.</b> Once they reach the <b>meeting</b> <b>point,</b> all of the worlds can be tackled with any character in any order. The overall objective of the game is to explore all the galaxy to collect several starship parts and save a large number of survivors. The player can then use a starship and travel to the final stage.|$|E
5|$|During the French Revolution, the Pavillon de Flore {{was renamed}} Pavillon de l'Égalité (House of Equality). Under its new name, {{it became the}} <b>meeting</b> <b>point</b> for several of the Committees of the period. Many other {{committees}} of the Revolutionary Government occupied the Palais des Tuileries (referred to by contemporaries as the Palace of the Nation) {{during the time of}} the National Convention. Notable occupiers included the Monetary Committee, the Account and Liquidation Examination Committee. However, the most famous was the Committee of Public Safety.|$|E

Only men were admitted, and all students were required to participate in the Corps of Cadets and receive military training. The campus bore minimal resemblance to its modern counterpart. Wild animals roamed freely around the campus, and the area served as a <b>meeting</b> <b>point</b> for the Great Western Cattle Trail.|$|E

5|$|New Forest ponies are raced in {{an annual}} {{point to point}} meeting in the Forest, usually on Boxing Day, {{finishing}} at a different place each year.

Riders with a detailed knowledge of the Forest are thus at an advantage. The location of the meeting place is given to competitors on the previous evening, and the starting point of the race is revealed once riders have arrived at the <b>meeting</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Urban District Council {{received}} its {{coat of arms}} from the College of Heralds in 1957. After the change to borough status a modified coat of arms, based on the original, was awarded in 1976, and presented to the council on 24 March 1977. It features a central cross on a shield, representing the town's location at the <b>meeting</b> <b>point</b> of north–south and east–west roads. The shield bears nine martlets representing both the county of Sussex and the new town's original nine neighbourhoods. Supporters, of an eagle and a winged lion, relate to {{the significance of the}} airport to the locality. The motto featured is I Grow and I Rejoice—a translation of a phrase from the Epistulae of Seneca the Younger.|$|E
5|$|The Witham, {{which was}} {{originally}} tidal up to Lincoln, {{was an important}} navigation in Roman times. Lincoln (Lindum)—the <b>meeting</b> <b>point</b> of Ermine Street, joining London to York, and Fosse Way, leading to Leicester and Bath—was an important Roman fort that became one of only four colonia in Britain. Most important Roman cities were situated near navigable water, which enabled goods to be transported in bulk, but Lincoln did not possess this advantage, and so the Romans constructed the Fossdyke from Lincoln to Torksey on the River Trent, improved the River Witham from Lincoln to The Wash, and built the Car Dyke from Lincoln to the River Cam near Cambridge. The Witham thus gave Lincoln access to the east coast, while the Fossdyke gave access to the Trent and further on to the Humber.|$|E
5|$|The five-storey City Terminus Hotel, which fronted the station, {{was opened}} in May 1867. It was an Italianate style hotel and forecourt, {{designed}} by E. M. Barry, and it provided {{many of the}} station's passenger facilities, {{as well as an}} appropriate architectural frontispiece to the street. This arrangement was very similar to that put in place at Charing Cross. The hotel was not profitable, and was over £47,000 (now £) in debt by 1870. The City Terminus Hotel was renamed the Cannon Street Hotel in 1879. In July 1920, the hotel was the first <b>meeting</b> <b>point</b> of the Communist Party of Great Britain. Most of the hotel was closed in 1931, but the public rooms were kept open for meetings. The rest were converted into offices and renamed Southern House.|$|E

5|$|Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) waits nervously for {{an answer}} from his girlfriend, Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer), about going into witness {{protection}} with him. He states {{that it is too}} dangerous for him to stay in Erinsborough and that she can bring her younger sister, Sophie (Kaiya Jones), with them. Kate tells Mark that she does not want to lose him and agrees to go. Mark reveals that they only have half an hour and heads over to his house to pack. Sophie returns home and Kate tells her that they are leaving town that night. An upset Sophie explains that she cannot pack her life up in a bag and refuses to go. Kate tells her the decision has already been made and they are leaving. As Mark is wondering whether to call his parents, his housemate, Jade Mitchell (Gemma Pranita), arrives home unexpectedly. When she enquires about his bag, he tells her he needs a change of clothes for a double shift. Kate finds Mark and asks for more time, but Mark tells her they do not have any. He gives her the details of the <b>meeting</b> <b>point</b> and they kiss, before Kate leaves him.|$|E
5|$|Since {{classical}} antiquity, {{the area}} around Kvarner Bay has been characterized as a <b>meeting</b> <b>point</b> of diverse cultures—from Hellenic and Roman cultures, through the Middle Ages and a succession of various rulers, to the present day. This blending {{is reflected in the}} folklore of the area, including Zvončari—bell-ringers best known for annual pageant in Kastav, listed on UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Crossbowmen from Rab are a living history company reenacting an arbalest tournament first held in 1364 to commemorate the successful defence of the island using that weapon. A typical decorative motif used in the region is morčić (plural: morčići)—a dark skinned Moor used as a centerpiece on jewelry, usually earrings. Legend has it that the motif is related to a hypothesized battle between Croatian and Ottoman armies on Grobnik north of Rijeka, but {{it is more likely that}} it is of Venetian origin, as it is similar to the Venetian moretti motif, used mostly on brooches and pins.|$|E
5|$|The Bay Area is {{well known}} for the {{complexity}} of its landforms that are the result of millions of years by the forces of plate tectonics, since the region is located {{in the middle of a}} <b>meeting</b> <b>point</b> between two plates. Nine out of eleven distinct assemblages have been identified in a single county, Alameda. Diverse assemblages adjoin in complex arrangements due to offsets along the many faults (both active and stable) in the area. As a consequence, many types of rock and soil are found in the region. The oldest rocks are metamorphic rocks that are associated with granite in the Salinian Block west of the San Andreas fault. These were formed from sedimentary rocks of sandstone, limestone, and shale in uplifted seabeds. Volcanic deposits also exist in the Bay Area, left behind by the movement of the San Andreas fault, whose movement sliced a subduction plate and allowed magma to briefly flow to the surface.|$|E

5|$|Antananarivo {{was founded}} from about 1610 to 1625, when the Merina king Andrianjaka (1612–1630) {{expelled}} the Vazimba {{inhabitants of the}} village of Analamanga at the highest <b>meeting</b> <b>point</b> of two forested ridges rising above the surrounding highland plains. Declaring it the site of his capital, Andrianjaka built a rova (fortified royal dwelling) that expanded to become the royal palaces of the Kingdom of Imerina. According to oral history, he deployed a garrison of 1,000 soldiers to capture and guard the site; the hill and its city retained the name Analamanga until the reign of King Andriamasinavalona (1675–1710), who renamed it Antananarivo ("City of the Thousand") in honor of Andrianjaka's soldiers. The city served as {{the capital of the}} Kingdom of Imerina from its founding until 1710, when Imerina split into four warring quadrants. Antananarivo was declared the capital of the southern quadrant; it remained thus until King Andrianampoinimerina of Ambohimanga captured the province and restored its role as capital of a united Kingdom of Imerina in 1794. His diplomatic and military successes extended Imerina far beyond its traditional borders, bringing the lands of neighboring ethnic groups under Merina control. These conquests were continued under his son, Radama I, whose control ultimately extended over two thirds of the island, leading him to be considered the King of Madagascar by European diplomats, with Antananarivo as the island's capital. Antananarivo remained the island's capital after Madagascar was colonized by the French in 1897 and remained thus after independence in 1960.|$|E

40|$|While {{conventional}} shared demand-responsive transportation (SDRT) systems mostly {{operate on}} a door-to-door policy, the usage of <b>meeting</b> <b>points</b> for the pick-up and drop-off of user groups can offer several advantages, like fewer stops and less total travelled mileage. Moreover, it offers the possibility to select only feasible and well-defined locations where a safe (de-) boarding is possible. This paper presents a three-step workflow for solving the SDRT problem with <b>meeting</b> <b>points</b> (SDRT-MP). Firstly, the customers are clustered into similar groups, then <b>meeting</b> (and divergence) <b>points</b> are determined for each cluster. Finally, a parallel neighbourhood search algorithm is applied to create the vehicle routes. Further, a simulation with realistic pick-up and drop-off locations based on map data is performed in order to demonstrate the impact of using <b>meeting</b> <b>points</b> for SDRT systems {{in contrast to the}} door-to-door service. Although the average passenger travel time is higher due to enhanced walking and waiting times, the experiment highlights a reduction of operator resources required to serve all customers.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} ‘Every step counts!’ – a ten-week, structured walking {{intervention in}} a community-based senior organization – on promoting physical activity participation, fitness and well-being among older adults (age ≥ 55 years). The intervention prescribed pedometer defined walks in weekly walking schedules. These were fitness-tailored and structured in walking load (intensity/volume) {{according to the}} principles of training progression. This intervention was offered as a social activity at <b>meeting</b> <b>points</b> of a community-based senior organization. Twenty-nine <b>meeting</b> <b>points</b> (n = 432) constituted the intervention condition. Ten <b>meeting</b> <b>points</b> (n = 148) formed the waiting-list control condition. Measurements were organized at intervention start (pre-test) and end (post-test). Intention-to-treat linear mixed models showed small positive intervention effects on physical activity, fitness and aspects of well-being. These results confirm the effectiveness of structured walking interventions with systematic training progression and underscore the value of community-based senior organizations as intervention setting among older adults. status: publishe...|$|R
