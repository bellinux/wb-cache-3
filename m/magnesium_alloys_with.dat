The relationship between the energy consumption during the plastic working and the characteristics of hot extruded magnesium alloys was evaluated {{from the viewpoint of}} the environmentally benign process. The cyclical plastic working marks a significant advance in refining microstructures, such as matrix grain and silicon particles added to synthesize Mg 2 Si via solid-state reaction with magnesium. For example, the grain size of hot extruded AZ 31 alloy is 3 – 15 mm, which is remarkably smaller than that with 20 – 80 mm in employing the cold compact without using such a plastic working. As a result of the grain refinement, AZ 31 alloys reveal higher UTS of 330 – 355 MPa than the conventional alloys of 270 MPa. The energy consumption of the cyclical plastic working with 200 cycles is 10 kJg 1 to fabricate the billet consolidated by hot extrusion, when using a high-speed screw-driven press machine. This is less than 10 % of the energy consumed by the conventional recycling process in re-melting wasted magnesium alloys (126 kJg 1).
