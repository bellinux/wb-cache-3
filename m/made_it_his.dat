5|$|After {{witnessing}} {{a bright light}} in the sky which most historians have identified as Halley's Comet, Zara Yaqob, Emperor of Ethiopia from 1434 to 1468, founded the city of Debre Berhan (tr.

5|$|During World War II, several {{properties}} on Park Lane {{were hit}} by bombs. Dudley House, at No.100, suffered major structural damage, including {{the destruction of the}} ballroom and gallery, though the building was partially restored. However, the strength of construction of the Dorchester Hotel gave it the reputation of being one of London's safest buildings, and it was a safe haven for numerous luminaries. General Dwight D. Eisenhower took a suite on the first floor in 1942, and later <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>his</b> headquarters.|$|E

5|$|Ideas for a {{film about}} the Schindlerjuden (Schindler Jews) were {{proposed}} as early as 1963. Poldek Pfefferberg, one of the Schindlerjuden, <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>his</b> life's mission {{to tell the story}} of Schindler. Spielberg became interested in the story when executive Sidney Sheinberg sent him a book review of Schindler's Ark. Universal Pictures bought the rights to the novel, but Spielberg, unsure if he was ready to make a film about the Holocaust, tried to pass the project to several other directors before finally deciding to direct the film himself.|$|E
5|$|In 377 BC, King Pandukabhaya (437–367 BC) <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>his</b> {{capital and}} {{developed}} {{it into a}} prosperous city. Anuradhapura (Anurapura) was named after the minister who first established the village and after a grandfather of Pandukabhaya who lived there. The name was also derived from the city's establishment on the auspicious asterism called Anura. Anuradhapura was the capital of all the monarchs who ruled the country during in the Anuradhapura Kingdom, {{with the exception of}} Kashyapa I (473–491), who chose Sigiriya to be his capital. The city is also marked on Ptolemy's world map.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Edwards' three {{terms as}} governor, he showed a {{willingness}} to surrender his own considerable powers in order to expand participatory government in the Illinois Territory. Before 1812, while Illinois had a first-grade territorial status, Edwards had vast powers to appoint county and local officials; however, he <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>his</b> practice to consider local opinion {{as much as he}} could when making appointments, often giving weight to petitions signed by local residents. He attempted to do the same for militia officers for a time, letting the men of a unit elect their leaders, but he soon abandoned this policy as impractical.|$|E

5|$|While rejecting Danish authority, Olaf <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>his</b> {{mission to}} convert Norway and the Norse colonies {{in the west}} as quickly and as {{completely}} as possible. Proceeding with threats, torture and executions, Olaf broke down pagan resistance {{and within a few}} years Norway was, at least nominally, a Christian country. But King Olaf had acquired several enemies during his meteoric rise to power. The most prominent were Eirik Jarl, son of Haakon Jarl, and Svein Forkbeard, king of Denmark, both of whom felt that Olaf had deprived them of their share of Norway.|$|E
5|$|Arsène Lupin III, the {{grandson}} of the fictional gentleman thief, Arsène Lupin, is considered the world's greatest thief, known for announcing his intentions to steal valuable objects by sending a calling card to the owners of his desired items. His right-hand man and closest ally is Daisuke Jigen, an expert marksman who can accurately shoot a target in 0.3 seconds. Although Lupin and Jigen frequently work as a two-man team, they are often joined by Goemon Ishikawa XIII, a master swordsman whose sword can cut anything, or Fujiko Mine, a femme fatale and Lupin's love interest. Although Fujiko usually works together with the others, she occasionally exploits Lupin's interest in her to steal the treasure for herself. Lupin and his gang are constantly chased by Inspector Koichi Zenigata of the ICPO, who has <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>his</b> life's work to arrest them, pursuing Lupin across the globe.|$|E
5|$|Morgan did {{not stay}} long in Port Royal and in October 1668 sailed with ten ships and 800 men for Île-à-Vache, {{a small island}} he used as a {{rendezvous}} point. His plan was to attack the Spanish settlement of Cartagena de Indias, the richest and most important city on the Spanish Main. In December he was joined by a former Royal Navy frigate, Oxford, which {{had been sent to}} Port Royal to aid in any defence of Jamaica. Modyford sent the vessel to Morgan, who <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>his</b> flagship. On 2 January 1669 Morgan called a council of war for all his captains, which took place on Oxford. A spark in the ship's powder magazine destroyed the ship and over 200 of its crew. Morgan and the captains seated {{on one side of the}} table were blown into the water and survived; the four captains on the other side of the table were all killed.|$|E

5|$|The {{location}} of the current citadel was first fortified in 1076 by the Turkman warlord Atsiz bin Uvak, although it is possible but not proven that a citadel stood on this place in the Hellenistic and Roman periods. After the assassination of Atsiz bin Uvak, the project was finished by the Seljuq ruler Tutush I. The emirs of the subsequent Burid and Zengid dynasties carried out modifications and added new structures to it. During this period, the citadel and the city were besieged several times by Crusader and Muslim armies. In 1174, the citadel was captured by Saladin, the Ayyubid sultan of Egypt, who <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>his</b> residence and had the defences and residential buildings modified.|$|E
5|$|Amalric {{had come}} to power in 1164 and had <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>his</b> goal to conquer Egypt. Egypt had been invaded by King Baldwin I fifty years earlier, and the weak Fatimid Caliphate was forced to pay yearly tribute to Jerusalem. Amalric turned towards Egypt because Muslim {{territory}} {{to the east of}} Jerusalem had fallen {{under the control of the}} powerful Zengid sultan Nur ad-Din. Nur ad-Din had taken control of Damascus in 1154, six years after the disastrous siege of Damascus by the Second Crusade in 1148. Jerusalem could now expand only to the southwest, towards Egypt, and in 1153 Ascalon, the last Fatimid outpost in Palestine, fell to the crusaders. Nur ad-Din, however, also wished to acquire Egypt, and sent his army to hinder Amalric's plans. This was the situation in the east when William returned from Europe. In 1167 Amalric married Maria Comnena, grand-niece of Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus, and in 1168 the king sent William to finalize a treaty for a joint Byzantine-crusader campaign against Egypt. The expedition, Amalric's fourth, was the first with support from the Byzantine navy. Amalric, however, did not wait for the fleet to arrive. He managed to capture Damietta, but within a few years he was expelled from Egypt by one of Nur ad-Din's generals, Saladin, who would later become Jerusalem's greatest threat.|$|E
5|$|During {{their attempt}} to escape Nalbina Dungeon, Vaan, Balthier, and Fran {{discovered}} Basch chained in a cage suspended from the ceiling. Though all three were initially suspicious of him (especially Vaan, who blamed him for Reks's death), Basch protested his innocence and told them about his twin. The party decided his story was plausible and released him. After being freed, he <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>his</b> mission to protect Ashe and support the resistance. When {{he and his brother}} were reunited, Gabranth was deeply puzzled by Basch's continued ability to hold his head high in spite of his past failures. Basch explained that his vow to defend Ashe had given him purpose and a renewed sense of honor. After the final battle against Vayne, as Noah was dying, he asked Basch to take his place as Larsa's protector. Because it was still widely believed that Basch was dead, he adopted his brother's name and title when he entered Larsa's service. In Revenant Wings, Basch is sent by Larsa to be the Empire's representative in dealing with the Judge of Wings. Basch was voiced by Keith Ferguson in English and by Rikiya Koyama in Japanese. He also appears in Itadaki Street Portable.|$|E
