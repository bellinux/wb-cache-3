25|$|The major tools {{used by a}} {{glassblower}} are the blowpipe (or blow tube), punty (or punty rod, pontil, or mandrel), bench, <b>marver,</b> blocks, jacks, paddles, tweezers, newspaper pads, and {{a variety}} of shears.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tip of the}} {{blowpipe}} {{is first}} preheated; then dipped in the molten glass in the furnace. The molten glass is [...] "gathered" [...] onto {{the end of the}} blowpipe {{in much the same way}} that viscous honey is picked up on a honey dipper. This glass is then rolled on the <b>marver,</b> which was traditionally a flat slab of marble, but today is more commonly a fairly thick flat sheet of steel. This process, called marvering, forms a cool skin on the exterior of the molten glass blob, and shapes it. Then air is blown into the pipe, creating a bubble. Next, the glassworker can gather more glass over that bubble to create a larger piece. Once a piece has been blown to its approximate final size, the bottom is finalized. Then, the molten glass is attached to a stainless steel or iron rod called a punty [...] for shaping and transferring the hollow piece from the blowpipe to provide an opening and/or to finalize the top.|$|E
2500|$|The bench is a {{glassblower}}'s workstation, {{and has a}} {{place for}} the glassblower to sit, {{a place for the}} handheld tools, and two rails that the pipe or punty rides on while the blower works with the piece. Blocks are ladle-like tools made from water-soaked fruitwood, and are used similarly to the <b>marver</b> to shape and cool a piece in the early steps of creation. [...] In similar fashion, pads of water-soaked newspaper (roughly 6 inches square, one-half to one inch thick), held in the bare hand, can be used to shape the piece. [...] Jacks are tools shaped somewhat like large tweezers with two blades, which are used for forming shape later {{in the creation of a}} piece. Paddles are flat pieces of wood or graphite used for creating flat spots such as a bottom. Tweezers are used to pick out details or to pull on the glass. There are two important types of shears, straight shears and diamond shears. Straight shears are essentially bulky scissors, used for making linear cuts. Diamond shears have blades that form a diamond shape when partially open. These are used for cutting off masses of glass.|$|E

5000|$|Probably the {{earliest}} beads of true glass {{were made by}} the winding method. Glass at a temperature high enough to make it workable, or [...] "ductile", is laid down or wound around a steel wire or mandrel coated in a clay slip called [...] "bead release." [...] The wound bead, while still hot, may be further shaped by manipulating with graphite, wood, stainless steel, brass, tungsten or marble tools and paddles. This process is called <b>marvering,</b> originating from the French word [...] "marbrer" [...] which translates to [...] "marble". It can also be pressed into a mold in its molten state. While still hot, or after re-heating, the surface of the bead may be decorated with fine rods of colored glass called stringers. These are a type of lampwork beads.|$|R
50|$|Once murrine {{have been}} made, {{they can be}} {{incorporated}} into a glass vessel or sculpture in several ways. A number of murrine may be scattered, more or less randomly, on a <b>marver</b> (steel table) and then picked up on the surface of a partially-blown glass bubble. Further blowing, heating, and shaping on the <b>marver</b> will incorporate the murrine completely into the bubble, creating a random arrangement of murrine in the vessel or sculpture beling blown.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>marver</b> {{is a tool}} used in glassblowing. It {{generally}} is made of a polished steel, brass, or graphite surface attached to a metal or wooden table. For fine applications such as lampworking, a smaller hand-held implement may instead be used.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the glass}} comes in {{direct contact with}} the <b>marver,</b> it must be kept {{exceptionally}} clean in order to prevent points of poor conduction or the transfer of debris into glass worked upon it. Metallic marvers are generally rubbed with steel wool and then wiped with rubbing alcohol to prevent rust.|$|E
50|$|Warm {{glass is}} rolled on the <b>marver,</b> both to shape it {{and as a}} means of {{temperature}} control. With a high specific heat capacity, the surface absorbs heat from the glass; because of the relatively slow flow of heat through the glass, it does so particularly from the outermost material, forming a more viscous skin.|$|E

Starting {{with his first}} pop-up location in the Castro Valley Mall in 1984, he grew Spirit Halloween to 60 seasonal stores nationwide before it was acquired in 1999. His approach to short-term leases, locations, and the stocking of widely varied merchandise was novel in the Halloween retail sector.|$|E

Directed by Collins, the cast included Kerry Lacy, Thomas Colby, Will Moran, Andrew David James, and Emily <b>Marver.</b> The play met with warm reviews and succeeded with its audiences {{as well as local}} school children.|$|E
50|$|Cane {{can also}} be {{incorporated}} in larger blown glass work by picking it up on a bubble of molten clear glass. This technique involves the gaffer creating a bubble from molten clear glass while an assistant heats the pattern of cane. When the cane design is fused and at the correct temperature and the bubble is exactly the correct size and temperature, the bubble is rolled over the cane pattern, which sticks to the hot glass. The bubble must be the right size and temperature for the pattern to cover it fully without any gaps or trapping air. Once the canes have been picked up, the bubble can be further heated, blown, and smoothed and shaped on the <b>marver</b> to give whatever final shape the glassblower wishes, with an embedded lacy pattern from the canes. Twisting the object as it is being shaped imparts a spiral shape to the overall pattern.|$|E

50|$|Colours, {{techniques}} and materials vary {{depending upon the}} look a glassmaker is trying to achieve. Aquamarine is created {{through the use of}} copper and cobalt compounds, whereas ruby red uses a gold solution as a colouring agent. Murrine technique begins with the layering of coloured liquid glass, which is then stretched into long rods called canes (caneworking) different color canes are then arranged in a mold to form a design. Then they are heated to fusing temperatures and when fused then pulled (stretched) again like Taffy to reduce diameters. Then when cold, these canes are then sliced in cross-section, which show a layered pattern. The better-known term millefiori is a way of using lots of sliced murrine that being picked up from the <b>marver</b> by a gather of hot molten glass. When the amalgam of this type of murrine shows the likeness of many flowers, thus mille (thousand) fiori (flowers). Filigree (a type of caneworking), incalmo, enamel painted, glass engraving, gold engraving, lattimo, ribbed glass and submersion {{are just a few of}} the other techniques a glassmaker can employ many of which have not changed since Roman times (the Romans promoted their glass industry wherever they went).|$|E

5000|$|The glass-producing {{regions of}} Syria and Egypt {{continued}} their industries. It {{is for the}} materials excavated and produced at sites such as Samsat in southern Turkey, Aleppo and Damascus in Syria, Hebron in the Levant, and Cairo that this period {{is referred to as}} the 'Golden Age' of Islamic glass. The Middle Islamic Period is characterized by the perfection of various polychrome decorative traditions, the most important of which are marvering, enamelling, and gilding, while relief-carving and lustre painting seemingly fell out of fashion. Marvering involves applying a continuous trail of opaque glass (in various colours such as white, red, yellow, or pale blue) around the body of a glass object. This trail may then be manipulated by pulling it, creating a characteristic 'wavy' pattern. The object was then rolled on a <b>marver</b> (a stone or iron slab) to work the trail into the glass vessel itself. This technique, used on a variety of glass objects from bowls and bottles to chess pieces, was introduced around the late 12th century AD, but is in fact a revival of a much older glass-working tradition that has its origins in the Late Bronze Age in Egypt> ...|$|E
40|$|The {{glucocorticoid}} RU 28362 {{was employed}} to identify glucocorticoid receptors in the olfactory mucosa of the guinea-pig. Results demonstrate significant binding of RU 28362 and suggest that the olfactory mucosa is a target site for glucocorticoid action. Chem. Senses 22 : 313 - 319, 1997. Glucocorticoids are one of two broad classes of corticosteroid hormones produced by the adrenal cortex which act by binding to specific receptors present in target cells (Wilson, 1994). At least two types of cytosolic corticosteroid receptors exist: type I and type II. Type I receptors {{are referred to as}} 'mineralocorticoid ' and type II as 'glucocorticoid ' based on their in vivo binding selectivity (Funder, 1993). Mineralocorticoids, principally aldosterone, are typically involved in regulation of fluid and electrolyte transport (<b>Marver</b> and Kokko, 1983).

40|$|Since {{congenital}} hypoplastic anaemia {{was first}} described by Diamond and Blackfan in 1938, {{over a hundred}} cases {{have been reported in}} the literature. The syndrome is characterized by a profound per-sistent anaemia, onset early in infancy, a severe hypoplasia of the erythroid precursors of the bone marrow, and absence of other haematological abnor-malities. Until steroids become available for treatment, the anaemia was resistant to all forms of therapy, the life of the child depending upon trans-fusions. In some children spontaneous permanent remissions have been described. In a few patients, following a spontaneous remission, recurrence of the anaemia again necessitated transfusions (von Sydow, 1943; Diamond, Allen, and Magill, 1961). The aetiology of the disease is not known. Dia-mond et al (1961) suggested an inborn error of metabolism of some unknown blood-building sub-stance essential to normal erythropoiesis. In sup-port of this theory, Altman and Miller (1953) re-ported excessive accumulation of anthranilic acid and other tryptophan metabolites in the urines of patients with congenital hypoplastic anaemia. Pearson and Cone (1957) and <b>Marver</b> (1961) con-firmed these findings, but Smith et al (1960), Harvey (1966), and Price et al (1969) found no consistency in tryptophan metabolite excretion in patients they tested. Gilman and Howell (1969) reported a case of Blackfan-Diamond anaemia associated with histidinaemia, but assumed that the occurrence of the two conditions was coincidental. Although Blackfan-Diamond anaemia usually occurred as a single incident in a family, the observa-tion of two or more affected sibs in several families suggested the possibility of a genetic pattern. The mode of inheritance was never clearly defined. It was assumed to be autosomal recessive. Forar...|$|E
