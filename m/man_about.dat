He gathers the whole town to build the world's tallest human pyramid. After Jimbo and Kearney move their hands just before the record is claimed, the pyramid collapses into a giant sphere that rolls through town, taking in Agnes Skinner, Hans Moleman, and a suicidal <b>man</b> <b>about</b> to jump from a ledge onto the street. The entire town rolls to a truck weighing station and the Duff record book officials say that Springfield is the world's fattest town, ahead of Milwaukee.|$|E

The Smoking Man calls Skinner's bluff, knowing he {{no longer has the}} tape, but Skinner reveals that Albert and twenty other Navajo have memorized the {{contents}} of the tape and are ready to reveal it if either Mulder or Scully are harmed. Mulder meets with Scully at the hospital, who reveals that her sister died a few hours before. Mulder tells Scully that he believes that the truth is still in the X-Files.

5|$|With {{the success}} of Bride, Laemmle was eager to put Whale to work on Dracula's Daughter (1936), the sequel to Universal's first big horror hit of the sound era. Whale, wary of doing two horror films {{in a row and}} {{concerned}} that directing Dracula's Daughter could interfere with his plans for the first all-sound version of Show Boat (previously filmed as a part-talkie by Harry A. Pollard), instead convinced Laemmle to buy the rights to a novel called The Hangover Murders. The novel is a comedy-mystery in the style of The Thin <b>Man,</b> <b>about</b> a group of friends who were so drunk the night one of them was murdered that none can remember anything. Retitled Remember Last Night?, the film was one of Whale's personal favorites, but met with sharply divided reviews and commercial disinterest.|$|E
5|$|Scully is told by {{the scarred}} man that William is part alien and that she {{is being used to}} raise the child. Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) and Doggett tell Scully that the man's DNA is a match to Mulder's, but Scully refuses to believe it. While the three are talking, the scarred man quietly slips into William's room with a syringe. Though William's crying alerts the agents, the scarred man manages to sneak out of the room before they reach William. Reyes and Scully take the baby to the {{hospital}} and Doggett discovers the man's syringe. The doctor reports that William is fine except for an elevated amount of iron in his blood. In interrogation, Scully confronts the scarred <b>man</b> <b>about</b> his motives. It is revealed that he is actually Jeffrey Spender, a former FBI agent supposedly killed by The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) three years earlier. Spender is also Mulder's half-brother. Spender admits his actions were a ruse and that the syringe contained magnetite meant to make William normal. He explains that the aliens need the child in order to successfully invade the world, but now they have lost him. However, he notes that the conspirators will always pursue the child, despite what he has done. Spender says that he acted out of his hatred for his father, since the new conspiracy was created by The Smoking Man after the alien rebels burned the original group.|$|E

25|$|The show {{ended with}} the {{departure}} of all cast members except Ritter, who {{moved on to the}} spin-off Three's a Crowd (syndicated as Three's Company, Too in the Three's Company syndication package), itself based upon <b>Man</b> <b>About</b> the House’s spin-off Robin's Nest.|$|E
25|$|Three's Company {{went through}} a lengthy {{development}} process. Two different sets of writers attempted to Americanize the British <b>Man</b> <b>About</b> the House. Three pilot episodes were shot for Three's Company, a rarity for American television (although All In The Family had shot three pilots between 1968 and 1970). The show was recast several times at the instruction of ABC's Fred Silverman.|$|E
25|$|The show, a farce, {{chronicles the}} escapades and hijinks of the trio's {{constant}} misunderstandings, social lives, and financial struggles.

The other two films were Too Late the Hero, in which Fonda played a secondary role, and There Was a Crooked <b>Man,</b> <b>about</b> Paris Pitman Jr. (played by Kirk Douglas) trying to escape from an Arizona prison.|$|E
25|$|Three's Company {{had many}} cast changes over its run. The {{first of these}} changes {{took place in the}} spring of 1979 with the {{relocation}} of the Ropers to their own television series (The Ropers), which revolved around Helen and Stanley, and their neighbors in a townhouse community after Stanley had sold the apartment building. <b>Man</b> <b>About</b> The House had similarly spun the Ropers off for the series George and Mildred.|$|E

They had previously pitched the series, unsuccessfully, to DC before writing Outcasts. It was first published as a four-part miniseries by the Scottish independent Fat Man Press in 1989, intending to tie in with Glasgow's position as European City of Culture in 1990, and further stories followed from other publishers.|$|E
