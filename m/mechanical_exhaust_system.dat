40|$|AbstractIn {{high-rise}} building fire, smoke {{is the main}} cause of fire spreading and casualties. As a necessary evacuation route, it's very important for both evacuation and firefighting to ensure the effectiveness of smoke exhaust in corridor. While in <b>mechanical</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> in corridor, the height of the exhaust port is a main factor that influences the smoke exhaust effect. FDS software was used in this paper to carry on the numerical simulation. Smoke exhaust effect under different working conditions were studied through comprehensive analysis of the smoke layer temperature and visibility in annular corridor with different mechanical smoke exhaust port height. Results show that installation height of the mechanical smoke exhaust port has some influence on smoke layer temperature and visibility. With the lower of the installation height of mechanical smoke exhaust port, smoke layer temperature at 1. 5 m height of corridor rises gradually, and visibility reduces gradually.

40|$|Provision of {{make-up air}} is {{essential}} in designing <b>mechanical</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> in a compartment. There are always problems in determining the inlet positions for supplying make-up air. In this paper, a zone model for studying the effect of different positions of make-up air supply {{on the performance of}} a <b>mechanical</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> in an atrium will be developed. Traditional two-layer approach with an upper smoke layer and a lower air layer will be assumed. Three scenarios of extraction with different relative positions of the air inlet are studied. These are scenarios with the smoke layer interface lying above, within, and below the air inlet. Conservation of mass and energy are considered for each scenario to study the smoke filling process. Transient variations of smoke layer temperature and interface height will be predicted under different fire sizes, exhaust rates and make-up air conditions. Full-scale burning tests in an atrium were conducted to justify the predicted results. In addition, results predicted by this zone model will also be compared with those predicted by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with the software Fire Dynamics Simulator FDS version 3. 1; and another zone model CFAST version 5. 0. 1. It is observed that the predicted results from this new zone model agreed well with experiments and CFD results. However, results predicted by CFAST deviated from experiments for the scenario with the smoke layer interface lying below the air inlet. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E

It investigates theperformance of various smoke control systems for use in {{underground}} stations having only one exit to ground level. Two different smoke control systems with two different configurations were investigated: A pressurizing (positive pressure) supply air system; a pressurizing supply air system with platform screen doors; a <b>mechanical</b> <b>exhaust</b> air <b>system</b> with extraction fittings above the track area; and a <b>mechanical</b> <b>exhaust</b> air <b>system</b> with platform screen doors. Simulations were performed using Fire Dynamics Simulator, investigating two different heat release rates – 20 MW and 60 MW. The results show that both the pressurizing supply air <b>system</b> and the <b>mechanical</b> <b>exhaust</b> air <b>system</b> provide effective smoke control. The advantages of a positive pressure supply air system are a relatively simple installation and a lower requisite flow capacity of the fans. The disadvantage is that the smoke is not dispelled, but can be spread to other platforms of the station and even to the next station. The advantages of a mecha- nical <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> are that the hot smoke is removed, and that the spread of smoke is restricted to the platform directly exposed to the fire.

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to identify}} the problems {{that exist in the}} public transport interchanges (PTIs) in Hong Kong. The study was conducted through literature review, semi-structured interview, site observation, face-to-face questionnaire interview and ventilation calculation. Based on the result of the questionnaire interview, most people commented that inadequate ventilation was the main reason of the poor air quality inside PTIs. Factors such as smoking habit, health status, environmental conditions and seasonal variations were found to be associated with people's perception and complaints. The study revealed that most of the PTIs in Hong Kong were enclosed by structural walls which would hinder natural ventilation. Under such circumstance, mechanical ventilation should be provided. However, most PTIs in Hong Kong were designed with low level <b>mechanical</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> which is inefficient to capture vehicle exhaust gases. Instead, high level exhaust and low level outdoor air supply system is found to be a more efficient and cost effective solution. The provision of an air-conditioned queuing enclosure to separate passengers from the source would be desirable. The air quality problems inside PTIs can also be reduced to a certain extent through an introduction of stricter legislation and regulations. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|AbstractExhaust {{efficiency}} in tunnel fires with mechanical means was discussed. Heat exhaust efficiency and smoke exhaust efficiency were defined and studied under two different exhaust modes (longitudinal exhaust and transverse exhaust) respectively. Exhaust efficiency depends on smoke generation rate, exhaust rate, heat loss through walls of tunnel, configuration of extraction installations and so on. Under smoke extraction, smoke exhaust efficiency equals 1 if a quasi-steady vented stage without upstream outflow forms, otherwise smoke exhaust efficiency {{is less than}} 1. Heat exhaust efficiency is always less than 1 since part of the heat released by the fire is lost through the solid boundaries of tunnel by radiative and convective heat transfer between the smoke and ceiling lining. Based on experimental data obtained {{from a series of}} fire tests in a model tunnel, heat exhaust efficiency was estimated and influencing factors were discussed. In tunnel fires with transverse <b>mechanical</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>system,</b> heat exhaust efficiency varies from 20 % to 50 %. Heat exhaust {{efficiency in}}creases along with the reduction of the number of exhaust inlets turned on while extracting and decreases along with the increase of the area of exhaust inlet. However, quantitative influence of inlet position on exhaust efficiency still need further study and will be reported later...|$|E

40|$|This paper reports an {{investigation}} on the scenarios {{of the spill}} plume and the resultant natural filling in a full-scale atrium mock-up due to a retail shop fire. The study includes two aspects, i. e., the full-scale experiment and the numerical simulation. A spill plume model is proposed to predict the characteristic properties of the plume development in the atrium under a retail shop fire. Furthermore, to accurately predict the shop fire in the atrium, an improved zone model is developed combining the transport lag time model and the spill plume model. Besides validating the developed model by experiments, the case is also simulated by the established zone model, i. e., CFAST code, and the computational fluid dynamics model, i. e., FDS code. By both physical and numerical experiments, the process of natural smoke filling and the temperature rise in the atrium are investigated and well understood. It is found that a typical spill plume contains three regimes, i. e., the curved section out of the retail shop door, the line plume in the near field, and the axisymmetric plume in the far field. Predictions from the proposed empirical model for the spill plume and the resultant improved zone model compare favorably with the experiments. The study indicates that the atrium becomes very dangerous due to such shop fire if no smoke control employed. The ability of <b>mechanical</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> in the atrium to mitigate the hazard of a retail shop fire is investigated as well. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Although {{the cabin}} design {{is widely used}} for {{providing}} fire safety in big and tall public transport terminals in the Far East, there are many debates on its performance. Very few experimental studies with big fires in a cabin were reported in the literature. In many applications, smoke exhaust was at low level in the cabin. The performance of such systems has to be justified. Full-scale burning tests were carried out to study smoke exhaust at low levels in a cabin fire. A cabin of length 3 m, width 4 m and height 3 m was constructed. Smoke temperature, average smoke layer height in the cabin, and velocity in the fan duct were measured with different heat release rates and heights of the ventilation opening. Eight sets of tests were carried out with results reported in this paper. For smoke exhaust at low level, the interface of smoke layer was low, usually lower than {{the height of the}} ventilation opening. The fire plume was then at the continuous flame zone. The interface of the smoke layer would be tilted. The smoke layer near the mechanical exhaust ventilation was lower than that at the opposite wall. The calculated smoke production rate would then be lower than the mechanical exhaust rate, as air would be extracted directly from the lower layer. In designing <b>mechanical</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> in a cabin, the plume coefficient should be tuned up by a factor. In this paper, the mechanical exhaust rate used in cabin design at low levels would be estimated by changing the coefficient concerned. Plume correlation expression due to McCaffrey was taken as an example.

40|$|A {{detailed}} experimental, theoretical, and computational {{study of}} separated nozzle flows has been conducted. Experimental testing was {{performed at the}} NASA Langley 16 -Foot Transonic Tunnel Complex. As {{part of a comprehensive}} static performance investigation, force, moment, and pressure measurements were made and schlieren flow visualization was obtained for a sub-scale, non-axisymmetric, two-dimensional, convergent- divergent nozzle. In addition, two-dimensional numerical simulations were run using the computational fluid dynamics code PAB 3 D with two-equation turbulence closure and algebraic Reynolds stress modeling. For reference, experimental and computational results were compared with theoretical predictions based on one-dimensional gas dynamics and an approximate integral momentum boundary layer method. Experimental results from this study indicate that off-design overexpanded nozzle flow was dominated by shock induced boundary layer separation, which was divided into two distinct flow regimes; three- dimensional separation with partial reattachment, and fully detached two-dimensional separation. The test nozzle was observed to go through a marked transition in passing from one regime to the other. In all cases, separation provided a significant increase in static thrust efficiency compared to the ideal prediction. Results indicate that with controlled separation, the entire overexpanded range of nozzle performance would be within 10 % of the peak thrust efficiency. By offering savings in weight and complexity over a conventional <b>mechanical</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>system,</b> this may allow a fixed geometry nozzle to cover an entire flight envelope. The computational simulation was in excellent agreement with experimental data over most of the test range, and {{did a good job of}} modeling internal flow and thrust performance. An exception occurred at low nozzle pressure ratios, where the two-dimensional computational model was inconsistent with the three-dimensional separation observed in the experiment. In general, the computation captured the physics of the shock boundary layer interaction and shock induced boundary layer separation in the nozzle, though there were some differences in shock structure compared to experiment. Though minor, these differences could be important for studies involving flow control or thrust vectoring of separated nozzles. Combined with other observations, this indicates that more detailed, three-dimensional computational modeling needs to be conducted to more realistically simulate shock-separated nozzle flows...|$|E

However, the design criteria are not clearly demonstrated {{to be worked}} out through systematic full-scale tests. There are many arguments on sizing the exhaust fans, and whether a high exhaust rate is required in an atrium is a puzzle. Atrium hot smoke tests might be required to be carried out occasionally to evaluate their performance, especially when the design does not comply with the prescriptive code in having a high-enough exhaust rate. Experimental studies on <b>mechanical</b> smoke <b>exhaust</b> <b>systems</b> are necessary and have been carried out. The results are reported in this paper. The measured results are also compared with the empirical equations used in designs, following NFPA- 92 B derived by a two-layer picture.

There are significant deviations of the measured results from those predicted by the equations with a two-layer pattern. Mass exchange through the two layers in an atrium fire is suggested to be the key point. By taking the estimated mass flow rate across the two layers by experiments to be 30 % of the exhaust rate under high ventilation conditions, the two-layer zone model is modified.

Laverge et al. [12] compared different <b>mechanical</b> <b>exhaust</b> ventilation <b>systems</b> in accordance with five standards on five different dwelling typologies. A probability-based approach was considered for several input variables (such as façade orientation, CO 2 production by occupants, number of occupants, and occupancy schedules). A Monte Carlo approach was used with 100 simulations. This study reveals that for the Belgian, Dutch, and French standards, occupation time with an excess CO 2 concentration higher than 1000  ppm is less than 5 %. The authors demonstrated the high importance of air transfer grilles between rooms to reach a satisfactory airflow rate distribution. They also showed the weak importance of boundary conditions (e.g., wind speed and direction) in case of relatively small size trickle ventilators (as in the British, French, and ASHRAE standards). This conclusion is consistent with another study, where different ventilation strategies were compared [13]. This study showed that the performance of controlled air-supply opening size systems is less affected, by variable conditions such as climate or occupancy, than systems with controlled air exhaust. A sensitivity analysis was conducted by Richieri et al. [14] {{to assess the impact}} of the envelope airtightness on airflow patterns.

Baker Center for Science in partial fulfillment for the requirements of a Master’s of Science degree in Fire Protection Engineering at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. The report focuses on discussion areas specific to the curriculum of the Cal Poly Fire Protection Master’s program, including analysis of egress, structural fire protection, detection, alarm and automatic protection designs in comparison to current and effective codes and standards. This report also includes a, performance based, tenability analysis for the central atrium and the building egress using computer-modeling software (FDS, PyroSim and Pathfinder) Comparison to current codes shows {{that there are some}} building features that do not meet current code, including an inadequate number of exit doors for assembly use areas, inadequate floor egress capacity, and excessive dead end and common path travel distance distances. Rooms 304 and 306 on the third level are considered assembly use, since they are expected to have more than 50 occupants, but are only provided with a single exit instead of the required two. Rooms 304 and 306, also have a common path length of 67. 5 ft., which exceeds the maximum common path limits allowed for assembly use. Occupant loading on the third level is estimated to be 683 occupants, however, the calculated egress capacity of this floor, per the LSC, is 627 occupants. Lastly, a 57. 8 ft. long dead end corridor is located on the second level adjacent Room 239 and 260, which exceed these the 50 -ft. allowable from the IBC and LSC. In the performance based approach section, a design fire was selected and modeled, using FDS and PyroSim. The available safe egress time (ASET) was determined based on tenability limits suggested from the SFPE handbook. The ASET is then compared with the predicted, required safe egress time (RSET), which was developed using available data and modeling from Pathfinder. Using data from the SFPE handbook and the Pathfinder model, the RSET time is estimated at 12 minutes. The FDS model indicated that tenability is lost on the 6 th level at approximately 101 seconds (1. 7 minutes), due to lack of visibility. The model also indicated that excessive heat flux is expected on the egress path from exit stair 3, as early as 180 seconds (3 minutes) into the simulation. Tenability limits for air temperature and asphyxiant gases were not exceeded during the 12 -minute FDS simulation. To meet current codes, it is recommended that occupants on the third level are limited to 627 persons, and occupants in room 304 and 306 are limited to less than 50 persons. By limiting occupants, adequate egress capacity is provided, and rooms 304 and 306 are reclassified as business use. Business use areas, have less stringent common path and exit number requirements which are satisfied with existing construction. A new wall or closet is recommended in the dead-end corridor to effectively reduce the distance to acceptable levels. To provide tenability for the central atrium, a <b>mechanical</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> is recommended to provide adequate visibility, 6 ft. feet above the egress paths. Additionally, less combustible, or noncombustible furnishing should be used to ensure that acceptable levels of heat flux are maintained for the duration of egress. The use of non-combustible or less combustible furnishing could also help to maintain acceptable levels of visibility utilizing the existing smoke control system. Modeling should be completed to determine the most effective and economical approach...|$|E

To investigate the technical status of ventilation systems, the result from the compulsory testing and examination of ventilation systems (OVK) is used.

Even though this is a Deemed-to-Satisfy solution, the BCA sets out both prescriptive and performance requirements the system must be designed to satisfy. One of the key performance requirements is that the smoke layer must be contained within the smoke reservoir. Series of parametric {{studies were carried out}} using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analyses to examine the smoke filling of smoke reservoirs. The studies reveal that, with the BCA prescribed smoke extraction rates, smoke reservoirs with a minimum depth of 0. 5 m specified by the BCA are insufficient to contain the smoke layer within the reservoirs. For smoke layer containment, the necessary reservoir depths are significantly larger than the BCA prescribed minimum of 0. 5 m. These were investigated in the parametric studies and the necessary depths for smoke containment in the ideal, best case situations are given in the paper. Further studies were also carried out to investigate the smoke extraction for a smoke reservoir with a minimum depth of 0. 5 m. The results show that the smoke extraction rate required for containment of smoke within the reservoir is significantly higher than that prescribed by the BCA. The high exhaust rate is unlikely to be practical and may also introduce significant issues with make-up air. The viability of adopting the minimum reservoir depth and increasing the smoke exhaust rate for containing the smoke layer is questionable. Hence, in order to achieve the BCA requirements, reservoir depth greater than the BCA prescribed minimum is necessary...|$|R

Gas turbine <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> {{is an important component}} of the gas turbine. The work to study the <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> was less in the past. In fact, structure design of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> has important influence on performance and life of the gas turbine. In this paper, the three-dimensional structural model of gas turbine <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> is built, the thermal field and stress field for the <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> are analyzed by using finite element method (FEM). The maximum stress and distribution characteristics of stress field, the highest temperature and distribution characteristics of thermal field in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> are computed.

40|$|Single-sided natural {{ventilation}} is an energy efficient ventilation strategy {{that could provide}} satisfactory indoor air quality and thermal comfort. However, one of its possible negative influences is the cross-infection between households due to the two-way airflow. The present study aims at assessing the efficacy of <b>mechanical</b> <b>exhaust</b> (ME) devices to eliminate this possible cross-infection. CFD method was employed to simulate the buoyancy driven single-sided {{natural ventilation}} and the cross-contamination. Different occupant behaviour scenarios, such as ME-on centrally or ME-on individually, were compared with the no-ME case. It is found that <b>mechanical</b> <b>exhaust</b> could reduce the outflow of indoor air and increase the inflow of fresh air. However, the weakened outflow {{tends to be more}} attached to the façade and the re-entry risk may be increased. As the exhaust rate is large enough, the two-way airflow will turn into one-way inflow, and accordingly the vertical cross-household infection can be avoided. With ME-on in both floors, a low exhaust rate of 5 h- 1 could reduce the presence of the tracer from the lower floor in the upper floor by an order of magnitude. But if the ME is on only in one of the two floors, the re-entry of outflow to the upper floor may be aggravated at some specific exhaust rate. Therefore, in epidemic seasons, appealing residents to switch on their individual exhaust fans, or alternatively switching on a central <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> is recommended. The results will contribute to the control of airborne transmission infectious diseases in high-rise residential buildings. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
