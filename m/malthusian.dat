5|$|French-speaking naturalists {{in several}} {{countries}} showed appreciation of the much modified French translation by Clémence Royer, but Darwin's ideas had little impact in France, where any scientists supporting evolutionary ideas opted for a form of Lamarckism. The intelligentsia in Russia had accepted the general phenomenon of evolution for several years before Darwin had published his theory, and scientists were quick to take it into account, although the <b>Malthusian</b> aspects were felt to be relatively unimportant. The political economy of struggle was criticised as a British stereotype by Karl Marx and by Leo Tolstoy, who had the character Levin in his novel Anna Karenina voice sharp criticism of the morality of Darwin's views.|$|E
5|$|Birth control {{practices}} were generally adopted earlier in Europe {{than in the}} United States. Knowlton's book was reprinted in 1877 in England by Charles Bradlaugh and Annie Besant, {{with the goal of}} challenging Britain's obscenity laws. They were arrested (and later acquitted) but the publicity of their trial contributed to the formation, in 1877, of the <b>Malthusian</b> League– the world's first birth control advocacy group– which sought to limit population growth to avoid Thomas Malthus's dire predictions of exponential population growth leading to worldwide poverty and famine. By 1930, similar societies had been established in nearly all European countries, and birth control began to find acceptance in most Western European countries, except Catholic Ireland, Spain, and France. As the birth control societies spread across Europe, so did birth control clinics. The first birth control clinic in the world was established in the Netherlands in 1882, run by the Netherlands' first female physician, Aletta Jacobs. The first birth control clinic in England was established in 1921 by Marie Stopes, in London.|$|E
5|$|The first {{permanent}} birth-control clinic {{was established}} in Britain in 1921 by Marie Stopes working with the <b>Malthusian</b> League. The clinic, run by midwives and supported by visiting doctors, offered women's birth-control advice and taught them {{the use of a}} cervical cap. Her clinic made contraception acceptable during the 1920s by presenting it in scientific terms. In 1921, Sanger founded the American Birth Control League, which later became the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. In 1924 the Society for the Provision of Birth Control Clinics was founded to campaign for municipal clinics; this led to the opening of a second clinic in Greengate, Salford in 1926. Throughout the 1920s, Stopes and other feminist pioneers, including Dora Russell and Stella Browne, {{played a major role in}} breaking down taboos about sex. In April 1930 the Birth Control Conference assembled 700 delegates and was successful in bringing birth control and abortion into the political sphere – three months later, the Ministry of Health, in the United Kingdom, allowed local authorities to give birth-control advice in welfare centres.|$|E

Instead, in documented cases a lack of political entitlement to resources that exist in abundance, causes famines in some populations. He documents how famines can occur {{even in the midst}} of plenty or in the context of low populations. He argues that famines (and environmental degradation) would only occur in non-functioning democracies or unrepresentative states.|$|R
2500|$|His ideas came {{to carry}} great weight in British {{political}} {{debate in the}} 19th century, and they heavily influenced the movement toward the adoption of laissez-faire liberal capitalism. <b>Malthusians</b> were in favour of limiting population growth and began actively promoting birth control {{through a variety of}} groups. The term 'voluntary motherhood' was coined by feminists in the 1870s as a political critique of [...] "involuntary motherhood" [...] and as expressing a desire for women's emancipation. Advocates for voluntary motherhood disapproved of contraception, arguing that women should only engage in sex for the purpose of procreation and advocated periodic or permanent abstinence.|$|R

The fact that Swinburne was irritated at the {{unhappiness}} of Christians and yet more irritated at their happiness was easily explained. It {{was no longer a}} complication of diseases in Christianity, but a complication of diseases in Swinburne. The restraints of Christians saddened him simply because he was more hedonist than a healthy man should be. The faith of Christians angered him because he was more pessimist than a healthy man should be. In the same way the <b>Malthusians</b> by instinct attacked Christianity; not because there is anything especially anti-Malthusian about Christianity, but because there is something a little anti-human about Malthusianism.|$|R
40|$|More than {{a decade}} before the 1890 Census, some Americans began to {{perceive}} that the frontier was disappearing; they worried that, with {{the closing of the}} frontier, the country might lose its tough and resourceful individualism, its ability to assimilate foreigners and forge democratic institutions, its safety valve and its future hopes-in short, its uniqueness. Soon this 2 ̆ 2 frontier anxiety 2 ̆ 2 pervaded American writing, speech, and thought. David M. Wrobel traces the theme of frontier anxiety and its variations in American journalism, political rhetoric and policy, literature and popular culture, and academic discussions from the 1880 s to the 1930 s. He shows that racists, nativists, and <b>Malthusians</b> used the closing of the frontier to support their arguments; so did conservationists, preservationists, and antiregulationists; and so did imperialist expansionists, monopolists, labor leaders, Marxists, Progressives, and New Dealers...|$|R
5000|$|There was {{a general}} [...] "neo-Malthusian" [...] revival in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s after the {{publication}} of two influential books in 1948 (Fairfield Osborn's Our Plundered Planet and William Vogt's Road to Survival).

500|$|The 1832 Royal Commission {{into the}} Operation of the Poor Laws {{was set up}} {{following}} the widespread destruction and machine breaking of the Swing Riots. The report was prepared by a commission of nine, including Nassau William Senior, and served by Edwin Chadwick as Secretary. The Royal Commission's primary concerns were with illegitimacy (or [...] "bastardy"), reflecting the influence of <b>Malthusians,</b> and the fear that the practices of the Old Poor Law were undermining {{the position of the}} independent labourer. [...] Two practices were of particular concern: the [...] "roundsman" [...] system, where overseers hired out paupers as cheap labour, and the Speenhamland system, which subsidised low wages without relief. The report concluded that the existing Poor Laws undermined the prosperity of the country by interfering with the natural laws of supply and demand, that the existing means of poor relief allowed employers to force down wages, and, that poverty itself was inevitable.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the global {{sustainability}} bet made between Julian Simon noted conservative economist and author of the book The Ultimate Resource and Paul Ehrlich noted environmentalist and author of the book The Population Time Bomb. The paper replicates the bet using the same basket of metals and examines their changes from 1990 to 2005. The underlying premise of the “redux ” is to see if global economic integration and rising middle class consumption in the developing world will alter the outcome. In the original bet Julian Simon won and Paul Ehrlich wrote a check for the basket of metals differential value of $ 567. 07. So it will be interesting to see how the basket valuation changes after 25 years of significant global social and economic change. In the bet between Simon and Ehrlich the larger debate between <b>Malthusians</b> and Cornucopians plays out and the paper reflects upon this dialectic throughout the narrative. So regardless of the outcome an interesting story will emerge regarding global environmental sustainability and economic and environmental paradigms...|$|R
40|$|The almshouse {{dominated}} the thinking about {{poverty and the}} poor during America's period of industrialization and its greatest economic downturns. Yet economists had surprisingly little {{to say about the}} facts of almshouse demography, and what they have written has been a rather bad fiction when seen in contrast with American novels. The main object of the paper is to delineate typical characters and characteristics of almshouses in America, and to examine the plausibility of various literary characterizations in light of the facts. The data certainly suggest new stories about paupers in American history: economists, and even the new social historians, have gotten it wrong. Between the Civil War and the Great Depression, the typical pauper living in an almshouse was not Oliver Twist (as many believe). He was not the Shiftless Man of the classical imagination (as <b>Malthusians</b> and Benthamites believe). The typical pauper of an American almshouse was plural. Instructive examples in American literature include Lennie, of Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men; Denver, of Toni Morrison's Beloved; Mrs. Thomson, of Edward Eggleston's The Hoosier School-Master; and Forrest Gump, of Winston Groom's Forrest Gump.

50|$|Many {{institutions}} {{began to}} research the algae, including the Carnegie Institution, the Rockefeller Foundation, the NIH, UC Berkeley, the Atomic Energy Commission, and Stanford University. Following World War II, many Europeans were starving, and many <b>Malthusians</b> attributed this {{not only to the}} war, but also to the inability of the world to produce enough food to support the increasing population. According to a 1946 FAO report, the world would need to produce 25 to 35% more food in 1960 than in 1939 {{to keep up with the}} increasing population, while health improvements would require a 90 to 100% increase. Because meat was costly and energy-intensive to produce, protein shortages were also an issue. Increasing cultivated area alone would go only so far in providing adequate nutrition to the population. The USDA calculated that, to feed the U.S. population by 1975, it would have to add 200 million acres (800,000 km²) of land, but only 45 million were available. One way to combat national food shortages was to increase the land available for farmers, yet the American frontier and farm land had long since been extinguished in trade for expansion and urban life. Hopes rested solely on new agricultural techniques and technologies. Because of these circumstances, an alternative solution was needed.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to verify empirically that internalising externalities of private enterprises contributes to profitability on a long-term basis. One of the significant transitions of the economic environment globally {{at the beginning of this}} century has been the rapid economic growth of emerging countries. On the other hand, there is apprehension also about various social problems due to the rapid industrialisation of such emerging countries, or improvement in the living standard. Political-economist Malthus (1798) warned of such a drain on resources and energy, and the ravaging of the natural environment at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Present-day <b>Malthusians</b> warn of ruin because of the exhaustion of resources and environmental deterioration resulting from active business activity. This aims to tighten up regulations as "a governmental role" to the so-called "market failure. " Mill (1848) introduced the concept of “stationary state” in the "philosophy of economics. " On the other hand, Robert Solow (1956) highlighted the significance of technological progress as a factor of economic growth. In terms of the positive role of a private company, Porter et al. (2011) called it the strategy of shared-value creation. It is internalisation of the externality on a market transaction. In terms of research methodology, statistical verification was carried out based on the sustainability statement, the various publicity materials and the financial data released by each company. In conclusion, when private enterprises adopt sustainability activity positively, a consumer value, corporate value and social value are expanded cyclically...|$|R
5000|$|The first {{president}} was Charles Robert Drysdale, who was succeeded by his free union partner Alice Vickery. The league initially restricted itself primarily to an [...] "educative role" [...] which emphasised {{the importance of}} Malthus' economic arguments rather than practical information about birth control. The league had an increasingly socially and economically conservative tone as the 19th century wore on. Thus some earlier agreement between <b>Malthusians</b> and social reformers was replaced by mutual distrust. The league believed that the sole cause of poverty was an excess of births, and therefore opposed socialism, considered strikes and reforms of labour laws to be [...] "useless." [...] League members were primarily middle class and did not make many serious efforts {{to communicate with the}} working class aside from some debates with socialists during the 1880s. Although the league doctrine as a whole was hostile to socialism, some members were indeed socialists who were sympathetic to arguments in favour of birth control. The league also maintained some overlap with the women's rights movement which was concerned with birth control. The League began plans for a birth control clinic in 1917 but these stalleduntil they received funds from the philanthropist Sir John Sumner and finally the clinic opened on 9 November 1921 at 153a East Street, Walworth with Norman Haire as their honorary medical officer, three afternoons a week. Marie Stopes and her husband had opened their clinic nine months earlier. Stopes’ clinic was the first in the British Empire (but not the first in the world) and the League always emphasised that theirs was the first English clinic where birth control instruction was given under medical supervision.|$|R
