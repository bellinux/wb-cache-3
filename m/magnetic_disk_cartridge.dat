50|$|The RK05 DECpack was {{a moving}} head <b>magnetic</b> <b>disk</b> drive {{manufactured}} by the Digital Equipment Corporation of Maynard, Massachusetts. It stored approximately 2.5 MB on a 14", single-platter IBM-2315-style front-loading removable <b>disk</b> <b>cartridge.</b> The cartridge permitted users to have relatively unlimited off-line storage {{and to have}} very fast access to such data. At the time DEC had numerous operating systems for each computer architecture so operating systems could also be changed quickly. The RK05 was the disk successor to DECtape for personal, portable, and expandable storage. While the smallest practical configuration was two drives, many systems had four or more drives.|$|R

50|$|An early <b>disk</b> <b>cartridge</b> was {{a single}} hard disk platter encased in a {{protective}} plastic shell. When the removable cartridge was inserted into the cartridge drive peripheral device, the read/write heads of the drive could access the magnetic data storage surface of the platter through holes in the shell. The <b>disk</b> <b>cartridge</b> was a direct evolution from the disk pack drive, or the early hard drive. As the storage density improved, even a single platter would provide a useful amount of data storage space, with the benefit being easier to handle than a removable disk pack.

40|$|Traditional {{operating}} systems use <b>magnetic</b> <b>disks</b> as paging devices, although {{the cost of}} each page fault measured in processor cycles continues to increase. In this paper we argue that applications {{should be given the}} opportunity to use as backing store either <b>magnetic</b> <b>disk</b> or the memory of idle workstations within the same LAN. We have implemented a pager that provides this flexibility, measured its performance over an Ethernet, and found it to be superior to traditional disk paging. We conclude that as the available network bandwidth increases, the use of network memory as backing store becomes a evenmore attractive alternative. 1 Introduction Traditional {{operating systems}} use <b>magnetic</b> <b>disks</b> as paging devices. In such systems, pages that can't be placed in main memory are stored on the <b>magnetic</b> <b>disk,</b> and recalled to main memory when needed. Because <b>magnetic</b> <b>disks</b> speed does not keep up with processor speed, the cost of paging (measured in processor cycles) increases with time. For [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The ECMA Technical Committee TC 31 was {{established}} in 1984 for the standardization of Optical <b>Disk</b> <b>Cartridges</b> (ODCs). Since its establishment, the Committee has made major contributions to ISO/IEC JTC 1 /SC 23 toward the development of International Standards for 90 mm, 120 mm, 130 mm and 300 mm ODCs. Numerous ODC standards have been developed by ECMA TC 31 and published as ECMA Standards, {{many of which have}} since been adopted by ISO/IEC under the fast track procedure. International Standard ISO/IEC 10885, Information technology- 356 mm optical <b>disk</b> <b>cartridge</b> for information interchange-Write once, was published in November 1993. In September 1995 ECMA TC 31 established a project to develop a standard for increased capacity 356 mm Optical Disk Cartridges- WORM, using phase change technology. The project was sponsored by four companies and work began by TC 31 in December 1995 on the first draft submitted in September, 1995. This ECMA Standard specifies the characteristics of 14, 8 and 25 Gbyte capacity 356 mm optical <b>disk</b> <b>cartridges</b> of the type providing for information to be written once and read many times. This ECMA Standard leverages off of ISO/IEC 10885 to the extent possible to preserve the existing customer's drive, library, and media investment by maintaining compatibility, wherever possible, with the earlier International Standard 10885. This ECMA Standard has been adopted by the ECMA General Assembly of June 1997. - i...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Compared with {{traditional}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>disks,</b> Flash memory has many advantages {{and has been}} used as external storage media for a wide spectrum of electronic devices (such as PDA, MP 3, Digital Camera and Mobile Phone) in recent years. As the capacity increases and price drops, it looks like a perfect alternative for <b>magnetic</b> <b>disks.</b> However, due to hardware limitations of flash memory, techniques including storage subsystem and indexing originally designed for <b>magnetic</b> <b>disks</b> can not run smoothly in a flash memory without any modification. In this paper we explore problems of indexing flash-resided data and present a new dynamical hash index for flash memory in two schemas. The analysis and experimental results validate the efficiency of our design. I...|$|R

The feasibilities of four different analytical techniques, cadmium ion-selective electrode, dialysis sack, chelate <b>disk</b> <b>cartridge,</b> and ultrafiltration, in distinguishing biopolymer-bound and nonbound cadmium in aqueous samples were investigated. And two different biopolymers were used, including bovine serum albumin (BSA) and biopolymer solution extracted from cultivated activated sludge (ASBP). The ISE method requires relatively {{large amount of}} sample and contaminates sample during the pretreatment. After the long reaction time of dialysis, the equilibrium of cadmium in the dialysis sack would be shifted. Due to the sample nature, chelate <b>disk</b> <b>cartridge</b> could not filter within recommended time, which makes it unavailable for biopolymer use. Ultrafiltration method would not experience the difficulties mentioned above. Ultrafiltration method measuring both weakly and strongly bound cadmium was included in nominally biopolymer-cadmium complex. It had significant correlation with the Ion-selective electrode (ISE) method (R 2 = 0. 989 for BSA, 0. 985 for ASBP) ...|$|R
