25|$|Another {{emerging}} {{application of}} TALEN {{is its ability}} to combine with other genome engineering tools, such as meganucleases. The DNA binding region of a TAL effector can be combined with the cleavage domain of a <b>meganuclease</b> to create a hybrid architecture combining the ease of engineering and highly specific DNA binding activity of a TAL effector with the low site frequency and specificity of a <b>meganuclease.</b>|$|E
25|$|DNA {{methylation}} and chromatin structure {{affect the}} efficacy of <b>meganuclease</b> digestion. A thorough consideration of the genetic and epigenetic context of a target sequence is therefore necessary for the practical application of these enzymes.|$|E
25|$|As {{stated in}} the opening paragraph, a <b>meganuclease</b> with an 18-base pair {{sequence}} would on average require a genome twenty {{times the size of}} the human genome to be found once by chance; the calculation is 418/3x109 = 22.9. However, very similar sequences are much more common, with frequency increasing quickly the more mismatches are permitted.|$|E
5000|$|One recent {{advance in}} the use of <b>meganucleases</b> for genome {{engineering}} is the incorporation of the DNA binding domain from transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors into hybrid nucleases. These [...] "megaTALs" [...] combine the ease of engineering and high DNA binding specificity of a TAL effector with the high cleavage efficiency of <b>meganucleases.</b> [...] In addition, <b>meganucleases</b> have been fused to DNA end-processing enzymes in order to promote error-prone non-homologous end joining and to increase the frequency of mutagenic events at a given locus.|$|R
2500|$|To create {{tailor-made}} <b>meganucleases,</b> {{two main}} approaches have been adopted: ...|$|R
25|$|We know {{relatively}} {{little about the}} actual purpose of <b>meganucleases.</b> It is widely thought that the genetic material that encodes <b>meganucleases</b> functions as a parasitic element that uses the double-stranded DNA cell repair mechanisms to its own advantage {{as a means of}} multiplying and spreading, without damaging the genetic material of its host.|$|R
25|$|In nature, these {{proteins}} are encoded by mobile genetic elements, introns or inteins. Introns propagate by intervening at {{a precise}} {{location in the}} DNA, where {{the expression of the}} <b>meganuclease</b> produces a break in the complementary intron- or intein-free allele. For inteins and group I introns, this break leads to the duplication of the intron or intein at the cutting site by means of the homologous recombination repair for double-stranded DNA breaks.|$|E
25|$|These two {{approaches}} {{can be combined}} to increase the possibility of creating new enzymes, while maintaining {{a high degree of}} efficacy and specificity. The scientists from Cellectis have been working on gene editing since 1999 and have developed a collection of over 20,000 protein domains from the homodimeric <b>meganuclease</b> I-CreI as well as from other meganucleases scaffolds. They can be combined to form functional chimeric tailor-made heterodimers for research laboratories and for industrial purposes.|$|E
25|$|However, the meganuclease-induced genetic recombinations {{that could}} be {{performed}} were limited by the repertoire of meganucleases available. Despite the existence of hundreds of meganucleases in nature, {{and the fact that}} each one is able to tolerate minor variations in its recognition site, the probability of finding a <b>meganuclease</b> able to cut a given gene at the desired location is extremely slim. Several groups turned their attention to engineering new meganucleases that would target the desired recognition sites.|$|E
50|$|<b>Meganucleases,</b> {{discovered}} in the late 1980s, are enzymes in the endonuclease family which are characterized by their capacity to recognize and cut large DNA sequences (from 12 to 40 base pairs). The most widespread and best known <b>meganucleases</b> are the proteins in the LAGLIDADG family, which owe their name to a conserved amino acid sequence.|$|R
40|$|<b>Meganucleases,</b> also termed homing endonucleases, are rare-cutting {{enzymes that}} are encoded within the genome {{of nearly all}} microbes. These enzymes {{recognize}} and cleave long DNA sequences (typically 18 – 30 base pairs) generating double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs). The resulting DSBs can be repaired by different pathways leading {{to a variety of}} site-specific DNA modifications, such as insertions, deletions, or point mutations. Over the past 15 years tremendous efforts have been made to engineer a number of variant <b>meganucleases</b> that cleave novel DNA targets. Engineered <b>meganucleases</b> are now being used to generate targeted genomic modifications for a variety of basic and biotechnology applications, including creating valuable traits in crop species...|$|R
5000|$|Among <b>meganucleases,</b> the LAGLIDADG {{family of}} homing endonucleases {{has become a}} {{valuable}} tool {{for the study of}} genomes and genome engineering over the past fifteen years. <b>Meganucleases</b> are [...] "molecular DNA scissors" [...] {{that can be used to}} replace, eliminate or modify sequences in a highly targeted way. By modifying their recognition sequence through protein engineering, the targeted sequence can be changed. <b>Meganucleases</b> are used to modify all genome types, whether bacterial, plant or animal. They open up wide avenues for innovation, particularly in the field of human health, for example the elimination of viral genetic material or the [...] "repair" [...] of damaged genes using gene therapy.|$|R
25|$|A {{more radical}} option {{has been to}} exploit a {{property}} that {{plays an important role}} in meganucleases’ naturally high degree of diversification: the possibility of associating or fusing protein domains from different enzymes. This option makes it possible to develop chimeric meganucleases with a new recognition site composed of a half-site of <b>meganuclease</b> A and a half-site of protein B. By fusing the protein domains of I-DmoI and I-CreI, two chimeric meganucleases have been created using this method: E-Drel and DmoCre.|$|E
25|$|Meganucleases are endodeoxyribonucleases {{characterized}} by a large recognition site (double-stranded DNA sequences of 12 to 40 base pairs); {{as a result this}} site generally occurs only once in any given genome. For example, the 18-base pair sequence recognized by the I-SceI <b>meganuclease</b> would on average require a genome twenty {{times the size of the}} human genome to be found once by chance (although sequences with a single mismatch occur about three times per human-sized genome). Meganucleases are therefore considered to be the most specific naturally occurring restriction enzymes.|$|E

25|$|The high {{specificity}} of <b>meganucleases</b> {{gives them a}} high degree of precision and much lower cell toxicity than other naturally occurring restriction enzymes. <b>Meganucleases</b> were identified in the 1990s, and subsequent work has shown that they are particularly promising tools for genome engineering and gene editing, as they are able to efficiently induce homologous recombination, generate mutations, and alter reading frames.|$|R
50|$|This {{technique}} has enabled {{the development of}} several <b>meganucleases</b> specific for sequences in the genomes of viruses, plants, etc., and the industrial-scale production of two <b>meganucleases</b> able to cleave the human XPC gene; mutations in this gene result in Xeroderma pigmentosum, a severe monogenic disorder that predisposes the patients to skin cancer and burns whenever their skin is exposed to UV rays.|$|R

50|$|These enzymes were {{identified}} in the 1990s as promising tools for genome engineering. However, even though they occur in nature and each one exhibits slight variations in its DNA recognition site, {{there is virtually no}} chance of finding the exact <b>meganuclease</b> required to act on a specific DNA sequence. Each new genome engineering target therefore requires an initial protein engineering stage to produce a custom <b>meganuclease.</b>|$|E
50|$|Meganucleases, found {{commonly}} in microbial species, {{have the}} unique property of having very long recognition sequences (>14bp) thus making them naturally very specific. This can be exploited to make site-specific DSB in genome editing; however, {{the challenge is}} that not enough meganucleases are known, or may ever be known, to cover all possible target sequences. To overcome this challenge, mutagenesis and high throughput screening methods {{have been used to}} create <b>meganuclease</b> variants that recognize unique sequences. Others have been able to fuse various meganucleases and create hybrid enzymes that recognize a new sequence. Yet others have attempted to alter the DNA interacting aminoacids of the <b>meganuclease</b> to design sequence specific meganucelases in a method named rationally designed <b>meganuclease</b> (US Patent 8,021,867 B2).|$|E

50|$|<b>Meganuclease</b> I-Sce I is a homing endonuclease. It {{recognises}} an 18-base pair sequence TAGGGATAACAGGGTAAT {{and leaves}} a 4 base pair 3' hydroxyl overhang.
