5|$|At {{the start}} proper, Lewis Hamilton {{was able to}} hold his lead, while his {{teammate}} Nico Rosberg tried to attack Sebastian Vettel in second place. This opened up the opportunity for the second Ferrari of Kimi Räikkönen {{to go around the}} outside of the <b>Mercedes</b> <b>and</b> take third.

5|$|Many fans of {{the show}} were outraged when Mercedes was {{supposedly}} murdered by Freddie Roscoe in November 2014, just a week after her sister Carmel died in a train crash. However, Jennifer Metcalfe stated that: 'Mercedes's departure is totally shrouded in mystery. Running up to the week where she exits, she has really annoyed pretty much everyone in the village, so it's 'who's done it?'.

5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. Since the cars of Manor Marussia failed to start, only three drivers were eliminated during the first session of qualifying (Q1), all of which was run in dry conditions. The McLaren cars of Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen struggled as expected, following their lack of pre-season testing and failed to make it into Q2, just as Sauber driver Marcus Ericsson. <b>Mercedes</b> <b>and</b> Williams' Valtteri Bottas were the only ones not having to use the softer tyres to proceed into the next part of qualifying.|$|E
5|$|The result meant Hamilton {{extended}} his {{lead in the}} Drivers' Championship to 14 points over Button. Vettel's third-place finish allowed him to tie with Webber in third place on 136 points, and Alonso's victory resulted in the Spanish driver reducing the deficit to be within 13 points of the Red Bull driver. McLaren maintained their lead in the Constructors' Championship although Red Bull's finish of third and sixth meant they reduced the gap by one point. Ferrari's one-two result allowed them to reduce the points deficit to Red Bull slightly. <b>Mercedes</b> <b>and</b> Renault remained in fourth and fifth positions, with eight races left in the season.|$|E
5|$|As the pit stops {{started on}} lap eleven, Massa, Nico Hülkenberg and Felipe Nasr {{were the first}} to come in for new tyres. Hamilton had managed to extend his {{advantage}} over Vettel to almost 8 seconds when Vettel made a pit stop– the first of the front runners to do so– on lap 14. The undercut-strategy worked, as Rosberg emerged from the pit lane behind the Ferrari when he made a pit stop one lap later. Hamilton changed tyres on the following lap, emerging close in front of the battling Rosberg and Vettel, with the Mercedes driver taking second position in a DRS-aided move on the inside of turn one. He was now close behind teammate Hamilton, but ultimately unable to attack him for the lead. Räikkönen was the last of the top four to pit, on lap 18 and applied a different strategy, as he used the harder medium tyres, while the <b>Mercedes</b> <b>and</b> Vettel were running their middle stint on the softer tyre compound. Even with the harder tyres, he was able to close to the top three.|$|E

5|$|Banza {{revealed}} {{his intention to}} stage a coup to Lieutenant Jean-Claude Mandaba, the commanding officer of Camp Kassaï, who he looked to for support. Mandaba {{went along with the}} plan, but his allegiance remained with Bokassa. When Banza contacted his co-conspirators on 8 April 1969, informing them that they would execute the coup the following day, Mandaba immediately phoned Bokassa and informed him of the plan. When Banza entered Camp Kassaï on 9 April 1969, he was ambushed by Mandaba and his soldiers. The men had to break Banza's arms before they could overpower and throw him into the trunk of a <b>Mercedes</b> <b>and</b> take him directly to Bokassa. At his house in Berengo, Bokassa beat Banza nearly to death before Mandaba suggested that Banza be put on trial for appearance's sake.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes has {{sex with}} Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard), the boyfriend of her sister, Jacqui (Claire Cooper). Mercedes discovers she is {{pregnant}} with Tony's child {{and plans to}} have an abortion. Jacqui discovers the affair and asks Mercedes if she can raise the child herself, as she is unable to have children. However, Mercedes has an abortion anyway. Mercedes has a brief relationship with Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss) and is upset to learn that he is having an incestuous affair with his half-sister, Beth Clement (Sinéad Moynihan). <b>Mercedes</b> <b>and</b> Darren Osborne (Ashley Taylor Dawson) make a bet: Darren has {{to have sex with}} Hannah Ashworth (Emma Rigby), and if he does Mercedes promises to have sex with him. Darren accompanies an intoxicated Hannah home and takes a photo of her with no top on. Mercedes refuses to believe Darren, but sends the photo to Hannah's boyfriend, Danny Valentine (David Judge). Danny ends his relationship with Hannah and sleeps with Mercedes.|$|E
5|$|Some teams made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the event. Ferrari, <b>Mercedes</b> <b>and</b> Renault introduced diffuser designs similar to the Red Bull RB6. Ferrari's design largely changed the shape of their exhaust system, and introduced a new gearbox case for Massa's car to raise the pick-up points of its rear suspension to help him adjust to the changes. They constructed a larger radiator to deal with the additional heat. Mercedes elected not to bring a new gearbox casing, but introduced a new rear diffuser to fully utilise the air blowing from the car's exhaust. Renault's design had the exit of their car's exhaust which had thermal protection against high temperatures and the team introduced a new design of their gearbox casing to allow for the pick-up points for its rear suspension to be accommodated. After running the F-duct device (which increases a car's top speed) in Friday practice, Red Bull decided to use it {{for the remainder of the}} weekend.|$|E
