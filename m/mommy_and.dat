[...] Mala had tried to hide it, but Vladek finds and reads it. [...] In [...] "Prisoner on the Hell Planet", Art is traumatized by his mother's suicide three months after his release from the mental hospital, {{and in the end}} depicts himself behind bars saying, [...] "You murdered me, <b>Mommy,</b> <b>and</b> left me here to take the rap!" [...] Though it brings back painful memories, Vladek admits that dealing with the issue in such a way was for the best.|$|E
500|$|At age 15 she {{was taken}} by her father to Lake Tahoe to {{audition}} as a lounge singer at Harrah's hotel and casino. She got the job, but her father, by then a widower, {{found it impossible to}} leave his job at the police force to chaperone her, and the offer had to be declined. Schuur was noticed by country music singer/actor Jimmy Wakely, who met her in an Elks Club in 1971 when she was eighteen. After auditioning for him, Wakely arranged a recording session in California. Accompanied by her sister, Schuur took her first airplane trip to the session in Burbank, [...] and made a 45rpm record of a song called [...] "Dear <b>Mommy</b> <b>and</b> Daddy". Schuur performed locally a great deal in her late teens, and had started to develop a distinctive musical voice. Entertainment writer Stewart Weiner called it a [...] "crystal-clear vocal tone hitting every note {{in the center of the}} bull's eye." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Girl Is Mine 2008" [...] {{received}} mostly unfavourable {{reviews from}} music critics. Journalist Christopher Rees stated that will.i.am had [...] "done a fantastic job of murdering a classic song". Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone noted that will.i.am's production was [...] "dumb-thug bluster" [...] and criticized him {{for trying to}} hide the [...] "goofy 'doggone' hook"—"the {{whole point of the}} song". Music journalist Aidin Vaziri criticized the song, stating, [...] " [...] Black Eyed Peas rapper completely erases Paul McCartney's vocal track from the original duet to make room for himself spouting nonsense such as, 'I call her <b>mommy</b> <b>and</b> she call me papa/I'm sorry Mike, but she loves the way I rock-a.'" [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic claimed that will.i.am had turned [...] "The Girl Is Mine" [...] into a [...] "hapless dance number". Kelefa Sanneh of Blender noted that [...] "will.i.am contributes beats (why?) and rhymes (why, oh, why?) to [...] "The Girl Is Mine 2008"". IGN's Todd Gilchrist stated that will.i.am's [...] "The Girl Is Mine" [...] remix was an offense. The offense was made even more [...] "egregious" [...] by the insertion of his own [...] "atonal vocal presence" [...] in place of McCartney's.|$|E
500|$|... "'97 Bonnie & Clyde", {{which was}} {{formerly}} {{featured on the}} Slim Shady EP as [...] "Just the Two of Us", was rerecorded for The Slim Shady LP to feature his daughter Hailie's vocals. Because the song focuses on disposing of his girlfriend's corpse, Eminem was not comfortable with explaining the situation to Kim, and instead {{told her that he}} would be taking Hailie to Chuck E. Cheese's. However, he really took her to the recording studio. He explained, [...] "When she found out I used our daughter to write a song about killing her, she fucking blew. We had just got back together for a couple of weeks. Then I played her the song and she bugged the fuck out." [...] Eminem also said, [...] "When she (Hailie) gets old enough, I'm going to explain it to her. I'll let her know that <b>Mommy</b> <b>and</b> Daddy weren't getting along at the time. None of it was to be taken too literally, although at the time I wanted to fucking do it." [...] The song [...] "Guilty Conscience" [...] contains a humorous reference to an occasion in which Dr. Dre assaulted rapper Dee Barnes. [...] Having only known Dr. Dre for a few days, Eminem was anxious about how he would react to such a line, and to his relief, Dr. Dre [...] "fell out of his chair laughing" [...] upon hearing the lyric. [...] "Ken Kaniff", a skit involving a prank call to Eminem, featured fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle. [...] After a falling out between the two in the wake of Eminem's breakthrough success, Eminem instead played Ken Kaniff on skits on future albums.|$|E

5000|$|Beginning with {{brightest}} day, the Young Man {{is performing}} calisthenics (which {{he continues to}} do {{until the very end}} of the play) near a sandbox (or sandpit) at the beach. <b>Mommy</b> <b>and</b> Daddy have brought Grandma all the way out from the city and place her in the sandbox. As <b>Mommy</b> <b>and</b> Daddy wait nearby in some chairs, the Musician plays off and on, according to what the other characters instruct him to do. Throughout the play, the Young Man is very pleasant, greeting the other characters with a smile as he says, [...] "Hi!". As <b>Mommy</b> <b>and</b> Daddy cease to acknowledge Grandma while they wait, Grandma reverts from her childish behavior and begins to speak coherently to the audience. Grandma and the Young Man begin to converse with each other. Grandma feels comfortable talking with the Young Man as he treats her like a human being (whereas <b>Mommy</b> <b>and</b> Daddy imply through their actions and dialogue that she is more of a chore that they must take care of). While still talking with the Young Man, she reminds someone off-stage that it should be nighttime by now. Once brightest day has become deepest night, <b>Mommy</b> <b>and</b> Daddy hear on-stage rumbling. Acknowledging that the sounds are literally coming from off-stage and not from thunder or breaking waves, Mommy knows that Grandma's death is here. As daylight resumes, Mommy briefly weeps by the sandbox before quickly exiting with Daddy. Although Grandma, who is lying down half buried in sand, has continued to mock the mourning of <b>Mommy</b> <b>and</b> Daddy, she soon realizes that she can no longer move. It is at this moment that the Young Man finally stops performing his calisthenics and approaches Grandma and the sandbox. As he directs her to be still, he reveals that he is the angel of death and says, [...] "...I am come for you." [...] Even though he says his line like a real amateur, Grandma compliments him and closes her eyes with a smile.|$|E
