25|$|Early {{engine coolant}} {{antifreeze}} was <b>methanol</b> (<b>methyl</b> <b>alcohol).</b> Methanol was {{widely used in}} windshield fluids, however, in Europe, due to new REACH legislation, the use of methanol in windshield fluids is limited to 5% and {{in the near future}} will be further reduced to 3%. As radiator caps were vented, not sealed, the methanol was lost to evaporation, requiring frequent replenishment to avoid freezing of the coolant. Methanol also accelerates corrosion of the metals, especially aluminum, used in the engine and cooling systems. Ethylene glycol was developed, and soon replaced methanol as an engine cooling system antifreeze. It has a very low volatility compared to methanol and to water. Before the 1950s, coolant systems were unpressurized and the engine was often cooler than modern automotive engines. By pressurizing the coolant system with a radiator cap, the boiling point of the fluid is increased, permitting higher engine temperatures and better fuel efficiency. Pressurized systems do not appreciably change the freezing point. Later propylene glycol was introduced due to its environmental credentials.|$|E
