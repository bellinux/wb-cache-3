5|$|Quique was {{recorded}} in July 1993. During {{their time in the}} studio, Seefeel also recorded the EP <b>More</b> <b>Like</b> Space. Clifford felt that the tracks on <b>More</b> <b>Like</b> Space were simpler to create while those on Quique were more involved and took longer.|$|E
5|$|The above table {{reflects}} the hybrid nature of metalloids. The properties of form, appearance, and behaviour when mixed with metals are <b>more</b> <b>like</b> metals. Elasticity and general chemical behaviour are <b>more</b> <b>like</b> nonmetals. Electrical conductivity, band structure, ionization energy, electronegativity, and oxides are intermediate between the two.|$|E

25|$|Van Damme turned {{director}} for The Quest (1996), which he directed; Roger Moore co-starred. It was mildly popular; <b>more</b> <b>liked</b> was Maximum Risk (1996) for Columbia, the first American film from Ringo Lam.|$|R

5|$|Gyromitra esculenta {{resembles the}} various species of true morel, {{although}} {{the latter are}} more symmetric and look <b>more</b> <b>like</b> pitted gray, tan, or brown sponges. Its cap is generally darker and larger.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} if the {{composition}} and appearance is <b>more</b> <b>like</b> that of Saturn or Neptune. Based on its temperature, {{it should be a}} Sudarsky Class II planet, covered in water clouds.|$|E
5|$|Some recent genetic {{evidence}} suggests the Indo-Pacific bottlenose {{belongs in the}} genus Stenella, since it is <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the Atlantic spotted dolphin (Stenella frontalis) than the common bottlenose.|$|E

5000|$|Despite no-one else on {{the team}} {{especially}} liking Zoe's personality, {{most of the other}} members of Revolution grudgingly admitted she deserved the most credit for their win. By contrast, Hibah was much <b>more</b> <b>liked</b> by her team-mates, but there was a feeling she had lacked authority in her leadership role.|$|R
5|$|As for the {{development}} of the parochial system, David's traditional role as its creator can not be sustained. Scotland already had an ancient system of parish churches dating to the Early Middle Ages, and the kind of system introduced by David's Normanising tendencies can more accurately be seen as mild refashioning, rather than creation; he made the Scottish system as a whole <b>more</b> <b>like</b> that of France and England, but he did not create it.|$|E
5|$|By {{directing}} the light forwards towards an observer (rather than towards the aircraft's skin), the system provided {{effective and efficient}} counter-illumination camouflage, <b>more</b> <b>like</b> that of marine animals such as the firefly squid than the Canadian diffused lighting approach. However, the system never entered active service.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage in {{relatively}} shallow waters is <b>more</b> <b>like</b> terrestrial camouflage, where additional methods {{are used by}} many animals. For example, self-decoration is employed by decorator crabs; mimesis by animals such as the leafy sea dragon; countershading by many fish including sharks; distraction with eyespots by many fish; active camouflage through ability to change colour rapidly in fish such as the flounder, and cephalopods including octopus, cuttlefish, and squid.|$|E
60|$|His down-heartedness, indeed, {{surprised}} {{most of his}} acquaintances {{in and out of}} the regiment, for {{the young}} lady was no beauty, and a doubtful fortune, and Dennis was a man outwardly of an unromantic turn, who seemed to have a great deal <b>more</b> <b>liking</b> for beefsteak and whisky-punch than for women, however fascinating.|$|R

5|$|Crystal Palace's two Dicynodon {{models are}} based on {{incomplete}} Permian fossils found in South Africa, along with Owen's guess that they were similar to turtles. There {{is no evidence of}} any shelled Dicynodon, and recent more complete fossils show that they looked <b>more</b> <b>like</b> Hippopotamus.|$|E
5|$|Edgar Murray finds Threni less {{expressive}} {{than the}} Krenek, and <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the Lamentationes of Thomas Tallis.

5|$|Folklorist Campbell of Islay has {{speculated that}} {{descriptions}} of the boobrie may be based on sightings of the great auk. The bellowing sound made by the boobrie, <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a bull than a bird, may have its origin in the strange call of the common bittern, which was a rare visitor to Scotland.|$|E

5|$|Grasshoppers undergo {{incomplete}} metamorphosis: they repeatedly moult (undergo ecdysis), each instar becoming {{larger and}} <b>more</b> <b>like</b> an adult, with the wing-buds increasing in size at each stage. The number of instars varies between species but is often six. After the final moult, the wings are inflated and become fully functional. The migratory grasshopper, Melanoplus sanguinipes, spends about 25 to 30 {{days as a}} nymph, depending on sex and temperature, and lives for about 51 days as an adult.|$|E
5|$|Hugo Weaving, who {{portrayed the}} Red Skull, wore a latex mask {{conceived}} by prosthetic makeup designer David White. The visual effects team had to manipulate his face considerably, as the mask was bulky {{and they wanted}} {{to make it look like}} tight skin wrapped around a very bony structure. They thinned out Weaving's cheeks and lower lip, hollowed out his eyes, and removed his eyelashes and nose to make him appear <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the Red Skull character.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero spawned {{an annual}} {{publication}} called G.I. Joe: Yearbook. G.I. Joe: Yearbook {{differed from the}} typical comic book annual publication {{in that it was}} <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a magazine. Each issue contained articles about the animated TV program, a summary of the comic book's plot to date, and one or two original stories written by Larry Hama. G.I. Joe: Yearbook ran until 1988.|$|E

5|$|Lenis {{stops in}} Wagiman sound like English voiced stops and are {{therefore}} written using the Roman alphabet letters b, d and g. Fortis stops, however, sound <b>more</b> <b>like</b> voiceless stops in English, but are slightly longer than lenis stops. They are written with two voiceless letters, pp, tt and kk when they occur between two vowels.|$|E
5|$|Martin's weak {{performance}} in the leader's debate, along with an unpopular provincial budget by Liberal Premier Dalton McGuinty in Ontario, moved the Conservatives into a lead for a time. However, comments by Conservative MPs, leaked press releases slandering the then prime minister, as well as controversial TV attack ads suggesting that the Conservatives would make Canada <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the United States, caused Harper's party to lose some momentum.|$|E
5|$|Modern historiographical {{practice}} {{distinguishes between}} chattel slavery (personal possession, where the slave {{was regarded as}} a piece of property as opposed to a mobile member of society) versus land-bonded groups such as the penestae of Thessaly or the Spartan helots, who were <b>more</b> <b>like</b> medieval serfs (an enhancement to real estate). The chattel helot is an individual deprived of liberty and forced to submit to an owner, who may buy, sell, or lease them like any other chattel.|$|E
