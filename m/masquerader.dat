Lindwall dropped Hutton from Johnston's bowling before he had scored and the English batsmen played and missed multiple times. Hutton had trouble seeing and playing Lindwall’s deliveries in the deteriorating light with no sightscreen available, and Fingleton described it as [...] "probably Hutton's worst effort in a Test". O'Reilly said Hutton [...] "seemed to have lost all power of concentration and looked like a man being led to the gallows", calling him [...] "little more than a <b>masquerader</b> compared to the Hutton [...] ".

500|$|Many {{types of}} mimicry have been described. An {{overview}} of each follows, highlighting {{the similarities and}} differences between the various forms. Classification is often based on function with respect to the mimic (e.g., avoiding harm). Some cases may belong to more than one class, e.g., automimicry and aggressive mimicry are not mutually exclusive, as one describes the species relationship between model and mimic, while the other describes the function for the mimic (obtaining food). The terminology used is not without debate and attempts to clarify have led to new terms being included. The term [...] "masquerade" [...] is sometimes used when the model is inanimate but it is differentiated from [...] "crypsis" [...] in its strict sense by the potential response of the signal receiver. In crypsis the receiver is assumed to not respond while a <b>masquerader</b> confuses the recognition system of the receiver that would otherwise seek the signaller. In the other forms of mimicry, the signal is not filtered out by the sensory system of the receiver. These are not mutually exclusive and in the evolution of wasp-like appearance, {{it has been argued that}} insects evolve to masquerade wasps since predatory wasps do not attack each other but this mimetic resemblance also deters vertebrate predators.|$|E
500|$|When {{the players}} returned, Lindwall and Johnston {{extracted}} steep bounce {{with the new}} ball, troubling the English batsmen. However, Washbrook changed his tactics and decided to eschew the hook shot, even allowing some short balls to hit him on the body. Washbrook drove Johnston for three runs and then pulled Lindwall for a four, almost collecting Barneswho was standing close in at short legin the nose. He proceeded to score England's first 16 runs. Lindwall dropped Hutton from Johnston's bowling before the English batsman had scored. Johnston usually moved {{the ball into the}} right-handed batsmen, but on this occasion the ball went straight on and took the outside of the edge of the bat. Hutton had trouble dealing with Lindwall, and played and missed multiple times in the deteriorating light, hampered by the lack of a sightscreen. Fingleton described it as [...] "probably Hutton's worst effort in a Test". In a fidgety display, Hutton played loosely outside the off stump and missed four times in one Johnston over. O'Reilly said Hutton [...] "seemed to have lost all power of concentration and looked like a man being led to the gallows", and that he [...] "was little more than a <b>masquerader</b> compared to the Hutton [...] ". Hutton took 32 minutes of batting to score his first run of the innings.|$|E

The main feature of such <b>masqueraders</b> is that they have knowledge about the behavior profile of legitimate users. The dataset provided by Schonlau et al [4] (SEA) has been modified for including synthetic sessions created by <b>masqueraders</b> using the behavior profile of the users intented to impersonate. It is proposed an hybrid method for detection of <b>masqueraders</b> based on the compression of the users sessions and Hidden Markov Models. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using ROC curves and compared against other known methods. As is shown in results of the experiments, the proposed detection mechanism is the best of the methods here considered. ...|$|R

Praised for a natural, subtle acting style, she was particularly effective as a comedian in such popular one-reelers as Miss <b>Masquerader</b> (1911) and Love Finds a Way (1912), all of which were produced at Fort Lee, New Jersey, then the center of the burgeoning American motion picture industry.|$|E
2500|$|Jarrell was {{a native}} of Nashville, Tennessee. He {{attended}} Hume-Fogg High School where he [...] "practiced tennis, starred in some school plays, and {{began his career as a}} critic with satirical essays in a school magazine." [...] He received his B.A. from Vanderbilt University in 1935. [...] While at Vanderbilt, he edited the student humor magazine The <b>Masquerader,</b> was captain of the tennis team, made Phi Beta Kappa and graduated magna cum laude. He studied there under Robert Penn Warren, who first published Jarrell's criticism; Allen Tate, who first published Jarrell's poetry; and John Crowe Ransom, who gave Jarrell his first teaching job as a Freshman Composition instructor at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio. Although all of these Vanderbilt teachers were heavily involved with the conservative Southern Agrarian movement, Jarrell did not become an Agrarian himself. According to Stephen Burt, [...] "Jarrella devotee of Marx and Auden embraced his teachers' literary stances while rejecting their politics." [...] He also completed his master's degree in English at Vanderbilt in 1937, beginning his thesis on A. E. Housman (which he completed in 1939).|$|E

Never had he encountered one who had so thoroughly irritated him, rasped his feelings, smashed his conventions, and violated nearly every attribute of what had been his ideal of woman. Had he been too long away from the world? Had he forgotten what the race of women was like? Was it merely a case of propinquity? And she wasn't really a woman. She was a <b>masquerader.</b> Under all her seeming of woman, she was a boy, playing a boy's pranks, diving for fish amongst sharks, sporting a revolver, longing for adventure, and, what was more, going out in search of it in her whale-boat, along with her savage islanders and her bag of sovereigns. But he loved her--that was the point of it all, and he did not try to evade it. He was not sorry that it was so. He loved her--that was the overwhelming, astounding fact.|$|E

First, you aimed a death-blow, and a treacherous one, at this scheme of a purer and higher life, which so many noble spirits had wrought out. Then, because Coverdale could not be quite your slave, you threw him ruthlessly away. And you took me, too, into your plan, as long as there was hope of my being available, and now fling me aside again, a broken tool! But, foremost and blackest of your sins, you stifled down your inmost consciousness!--you did a deadly wrong to your own heart!--you were ready to sacrifice this girl, whom, if God ever visibly showed a purpose, He put into your charge, and through whom He was striving to redeem you!" ...|$|E
60|$|Yet I {{had not the}} {{slightest}} intention of selecting {{the time and place}} in which the disclosure was finally made; nor was there any concert betwixt my learned and respected friend LORD MEADOWBANK and myself upon that occasion. It was, as the reader is probably aware, upon the 23rd February last, at a public meeting, called for establishing a professional Theatrical Fund in Edinburgh, that the communication took place. Just before we sat down to table, Lord Meadowbank [One of the Supreme Judges of Scotland, termed Lords of Council and Session.] asked me privately whether I was still anxious to preserve my incognito on the subject of what were called the Waverley Novels? I did not immediately see the purpose of his lordship's question, although I certainly might have been led to infer it, and replied that the secret had now of necessity become known to so many people that I was indifferent on the subject. Lord Meadowbank was thus induced, while doing me the great honour of proposing my health to the meeting, to say something on the subject of these Novels so strongly connecting them with me as the author, that by remaining silent I must have stood convicted, either of the actual paternity, or of the still greater crime of being supposed willing to receive indirectly praise to which I had no just title. I thus found myself suddenly and unexpectedly placed in the confessional, and had only time to recollect that I had been guided thither by a most friendly hand, and could not, perhaps, find a better public opportunity to lay down a disguise which began to resemble that of a detected <b>masquerader.</b>|$|E
