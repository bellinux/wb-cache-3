5|$|After the crisis, Unicamp saw {{a period}} of renewal and restructuring. In 1983 the bylaws were rewritten, {{ensuring}} {{the autonomy of the}} academic community, and the new <b>management</b> <b>structure</b> for the campus was implemented. In 1986 the newly created University Council replaces the previous Directive Council as the supreme body of the university. The last years of the 1980s saw a reformulation of the admissions exam, expansion of the laboratories and the completion of the first units of the student housing.|$|E
5|$|Giles Guthrie, a {{respected}} aviator, merchant banker {{and director of}} British European Airways who would take over from Slattery as chairman and chief executive, also intended to perform some of the managing director's roles, making Smallpeice's position essentially redundant; Smallpeice was asked to resign by Amery, leaving the company late in 1963 to facilitate Guthrie's new <b>management</b> <b>structure.</b> Smallpeice, like Slattery, considered that had effectively been sacked. The concerns Slattery and Smallpeice expressed about the financial arrangements {{of the company and}} Vickers VC10 purchases would be vindicated when Guthrie was able to have the government write off the outstanding debt, inject additional cash into the company, and permit the purchase of a smaller number of Vickers VC10 aircraft. The Corbett report was never made public; neither Slattery, Smallpeice nor Guthrie are believed to have been given access to the full report.|$|E

Media reports had initially indicated that Riis had been suspended when he did not appear at the 2015 Milan–San Remo as planned, and that this was due to a disappointing start to the season for the team. Later that month it was announced that Riis' contract had been terminated with the agreement of both parties. Subsequently the team revealed its new <b>management</b> <b>structure,</b> with Riis' former duties being carried out by new general manager Stefano Feltrin and Steven de Jongh, who was promoted to the role of head sport director.|$|E

5|$|The Senedd was {{constructed}} in two phases, the first in 2001 and the second from August 2003 until it was {{handed over to the}} National Assembly in February 2006. Between phases, the National Assembly changed contractors and the project's <b>management</b> <b>structure,</b> but retained Rogers as the scheme architect. The building was nearly six times over budget and four years and 10 months late, compared to the original estimates of the project in 1997. Total costs rose due to unforeseen security measures after the 11 September attacks, and because the National Assembly did not have an independent cost appraisal of the project until December 2000, three years after the original estimate. Phase 2 costs rose by less than 6% over budget, and that phase was six months late.|$|E
5|$|During 1938 and 1939, {{with war}} anticipated, an {{increasing}} part of Pick's {{time was spent}} in planning for the approaching conflict. The Railway Executive Committee was reconstituted in 1938 {{to act as a}} central coordinating body for the country's railways with Pick as the LPTB's representative. This role absorbed most of his time after the committee took over control of the railways on 1 September 1939. Following a disagreement {{with other members of the}} LPTB board over the government's proposals to limit the dividend that it could pay to its shareholders, Pick stated his intention to retire from the board at the end of his seven-year appointment in May 1940. Pick had previously suggested a reorganisation of the LPTB's senior <b>management</b> <b>structure</b> and hoped to be able to continue with the organisation in some sort of joint general manager position. Ashfield chose not to find such a continuing role for Pick and, on 18 May 1940, to the surprise of many within the organisation, Pick retired from the LPTB board, officially due to failing health. Pick's post of chief executive was abolished and replaced with a group of six heads of department.|$|E
5|$|For {{more than}} eight decades, the Toronto Argonauts Football Club was the sole {{property}} of its namesake rowing club. By the 1950s, the team's complex <b>management</b> <b>structure</b> made the arrangement increasingly awkward. Facing overdraft and with wealthy suitors knocking, the Argonaut rowers finally sold the team to a consortium led by John Bassett, Eric Cradock, and Charlie Burns in 1957. Each held about 20% share in the company, with the balance made up by small investors who had some affinity with the club; the initial agreement called for a long-term debenture of $400,000 {{to be set up}} that would sustain the rowing club in the absence of its football income. Bassett was the operating head of the franchise and is often given sole credit for the initial purchase of the Argos, but Cradock was also instrumental in spearheading the drive. He would sell his share to Len Lumbers just two years into his tenure in part because of Bassett's controlling nature. Bassett arranged a complete buyout of the other shareholders for $2.31 million in 1971 through his holdings in Baton Broadcasting.|$|E
