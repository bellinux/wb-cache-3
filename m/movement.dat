On 22 June 1941, the 1st Sisak Partisan Detachment {{was formed}} near Sisak, {{as the first}} military unit formed by a resistance <b>movement</b> in occupied Europe. This sparked {{the beginning of the}} Yugoslav Partisan <b>movement,</b> a communist multi-ethnic anti-fascist resistance group led by Josip Broz Tito. The <b>movement</b> grew rapidly and at the Tehran Conference in December 1943 the Partisans gained recognition from the Allies.|$|E

5|$|Bradykinesia (slowness of <b>movement)</b> {{is found}} in every case of PD, and is due to {{disturbances}} in motor planning of <b>movement</b> initiation, and associated with difficulties along the whole course of the <b>movement</b> process, from planning to initiation to execution of a <b>movement.</b> Performance of sequential and simultaneous <b>movement</b> is impaired. Bradykinesia is the most handicapping symptom of Parkinson’s disease leading to difficulties with everyday tasks such as dressing, feeding, and bathing. It leads to particular difficulty in carrying out two independent motor activities {{at the same time}} and can be made worse by emotional stress or concurrent illnesses. Paradoxically patients with Parkinson's disease can often ride a bicycle or climb stairs more easily than walk on a level. While most physicians may readily notice bradykinesia, formal assessment requires a patient to do repetitive movements with their fingers and feet.|$|E

5|$|Haydn's {{choice of}} D major for this quartet, {{with the second}} <b>movement</b> in D minor, optimises the use of open strings and allows for the work to be the loudest and most grandiose of the set. The first <b>movement</b> opens peculiarly: the first violin starts on an E, and {{proceeds}} to play a four-measure phrase that concludes with a D major chord. The use of a closing phrase to start the <b>movement</b> {{is the first of}} a number of unsettling incidents in the <b>movement.</b> The exposition withholds the expected cadence to the dominant almost until the exposition ends. And the <b>movement</b> itself has a tentative pianissimo ending that serves more as a link to the D-minor Adagio than a proper conclusion.|$|E

40|$|In 17 fetuses with {{intrauterine growth}} {{retardation}} (IUGR), we studied {{the quantity of}} general <b>movements</b> and fetal breathing <b>movements</b> both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. In IUGR fetuses, cross-sectional comparisons were made between the quantity of fetal <b>movements</b> and (1) the fetal clinical condition and (2) the quality of general <b>movements.</b> In addition, the quantity of fetal <b>movements</b> in IUGR was compared with that in uncomplicated pregnancies and in pregnancies complicated by premature rupture of the amniotic membranes. In IUGR, the quantity of general <b>movements</b> declined from 25 weeks gestation onwards, whereas the quantity of fetal breathing <b>movements</b> increased. Longitudinal assessment of these parameters was obtained in four cases and showed a decline of general <b>movements.</b> No relationship between prenatal longitudinal data and neonatal outcome could be observed. Relating the quantity of general <b>movements</b> and breathing <b>movements</b> to the fetal condition, growth retarded fetuses were divided into three groups according to fetal deterioration. 1. Normal amount of amniotic fluid and normal fetal heart rate patterns. 2. Reduced amount of amniotic fluid. 3. Abnormal fetal heart rate patterns. The quantity of general <b>movements</b> {{as well as that}} of breathing <b>movements</b> was low in group 3, compared to group 1. In group 2 only the quantity of breathing <b>movements</b> and not of general <b>movements</b> was low. A similar pattern was found in the relation with the quality of general <b>movements</b> observed during fetal deterioration. Cross-sectional analysis of median values (28 - 31 weeks gestation) did not reveal differences in the quantity of general <b>movements</b> when IUGR, normal pregnancies and premature rupture of the membranes (with or without oligohydramnios) were compared. The quantity of fetal breathing <b>movements</b> was significantly lower in pregnancies complicated by IUGR and by premature rupture of the membranes with oligohydramnios compared to those of normal pregnancies and premature rupture of the membranes without oligohydramnios. In uncomplicated IUGR, the quantity of general <b>movements</b> and breathing <b>movements</b> is in the same range as in normal uncomplicated pregnancies. Similar to the quality of general <b>movements,</b> the quantitative variables were related to the fetal condition. However, in contrast to the quality of general <b>movements,</b> the quantity of general <b>movements</b> and breathing <b>movements</b> showed a high inter- and intraindividual variation. Therefore, the results of this study discourage the use of quantitative aspects of general <b>movements</b> and breathing <b>movements</b> as reliable indicators of the neurological condition in the individual fetus...|$|R

40|$|During natural {{behavior}} humans continuously {{adjust their}} gaze by moving head and eyes, yielding rich {{dynamics of the}} retinal input. Sensory coding models, however, typically assume visual input as smooth or a sequence of static images interleaved by volitional gaze shifts. Are these assumptions valid during free exploration behavior in natural environments? We used an innovative technique to simultaneously record gaze and head <b>movements</b> in humans, who freely explored various environments (forest, train station, apartment). Most <b>movements</b> occur along the cardinal axes, and the predominance of vertical or horizontal <b>movements</b> depends on the environment. Eye and head <b>movements</b> co-occur more frequently than their individual statistics predicts under an independence assumption. The majority of cooccurring <b>movements</b> point in opposite directions, consistent with a gaze-stabilizing role of eye <b>movements.</b> Nevertheless, a substantial fraction of eye <b>movements</b> point {{in the same direction}} as co-occurring head <b>movements.</b> Even under the very most conservative assumptions, saccadic eye <b>movements</b> alone cannot account for these synergistic <b>movements.</b> Hence nonsaccadic eye <b>movements</b> that interact synergistically with head <b>movements</b> t...|$|R
