Multivariate <b>merit</b> factor is characterised and recursive Boolean constructions are presented which satisfy a non-vanishing asymptote in multivariate <b>merit</b> factor. Clifford <b>merit</b> factor is characterised as a generalisation of multivariate <b>merit</b> factor and {{as a type of}} quantum <b>merit</b> factor. Recursive Boolean constructions are presented which, however, only satisfy an asymptotic Clifford <b>merit</b> factor of zero. It is demonstrated that Boolean functions obtained via quantum error correcting codes tend to maximise Clifford <b>merit</b> factor. Results are presented as to the distribution of the above <b>merit</b> factors over the set of binary sequences and Boolean functions. ...|$|R

Maxwell was proven correct, and his quantitative connection between light and electromagnetism is considered one of the great accomplishments of 19th century mathematical physics.|$|E

5|$|Buddhist traditions provide {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} how this transfer proceeds. Transferring merit to another person, usually deceased relatives, is simply done by a mental wish. Despite the word transfer, the merit of the giver {{is in no way}} decreased during such an act, just like a candle used to light another candle does not diminish. The merit transferred cannot always be received, however. The dead relatives must also be able to sympathize with the meritorious act. If the relatives do not receive the merit, the act of transferring merit will still be beneficial for the giver himself. The transfer of merit is thus connected with the idea of rejoicing. The other person who rejoices in one's meritorious deeds, in that way also receives merit, if he approves of the merit done. Thus, rejoicing in others' <b>merits,</b> apart from being one of the ten meritorious acts mentioned, is also a prerequisite for the transferring of merit to occur. The purposes for merit transfer differ. In many Buddhist countries, transferring merit is connected to the notion of an intermediate state. The merit that is transferred to the deceased will help them to cross over safely to the next rebirth. Some Mahāyāna traditions believe that it can help deceased relatives to attain the Pure Land. Another way of transferring merit, apart from helping the deceased, is to dedicate it to the devas (deities), since it is believed that these are not able to make <b>merits</b> themselves. In this way it is believed their favor can be obtained. Finally, many Buddhists transfer <b>merits</b> to resolve a bond of revenge that may exist between people, as it is believed that someone else's vengefulness may create harm in one's life.|$|E
