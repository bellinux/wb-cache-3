500|$|In May 2012 Daft Punk's {{collaboration}} with Giorgio Moroder was announced—Moroder had recorded a monologue {{about his life}} {{for use in a}} track on the album. Rodgers was also present during the Moroder recording session. Moroder clarified that he was not involved in the composition of the track or its use of a synthesizer: [...] "They did not let me get involved at all. Thomas asked <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> tell the story of my life. Then they would {{know what to do with}} it." [...] Daft Punk had been in contact with Moroder in relation to a possible contribution for the Tron: Legacy score, but this never happened.|$|E

The storyline was introduced {{just over a year}} after Gordon's partner, Chris Burkhardt, died from acute myeloid leukemia at the age of 23. Gordon drew on her experience with Burkhardt to take on the storyline. Home and Away's producer, Cameron Welsh, approached Gordon about the storyline and asked her if she would be comfortable doing it. Gordon called it an [...] "amazing opportunity to be given". Gordon said [...] "The producer asked <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do this storyline and made sure I was comfortable doing it based on what I had been through, I definitely think this one tops all of them". Gordon added that anyone going through Martha's ordeal would find it hard, but [...] "you just look to your friends and family and do your best in that situation and then move on".|$|E

2500|$|Nancy's {{hair has}} {{dominated}} her many styles {{and she has}} had several different hair colours. When asked about her character's [...] "crazy" [...] hair styles Fox revealed that the ideas for the styles are a collaboration of her own ideas and the production teams': [...] "I had a brown bob forever and I was sick to death of it, so when {{we came out of}} the Jake storyline last year, they wanted to change the image. They asked <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> dye it any colour, so I thought 'let's go red'". Fox said that her initial Hollyoaks image featuring green hair was [...] "definitely not a good look". She added that during her tenura Nancy has had a [...] "few hair disasters", especially the in between stages when she [...] "went back to black from red and then to blonde". She said that since her character has been through so much she no longer feels it necessary to [...] "desperately shock" [...] everyone with her hair styles as she has had to grow up and evolve. Fox said she enjoys Nancy's style which has [...] "evolved" [...] as she has [...] "been a Goth, she’s been a New Romantic and now I like to call her Dusty Springfield on acid! It’s a bit Duffy, a bit ’50s-style, and now I’ve got the red hair it gives us more to play with". Fox added that [...] "one of my favourite things about being in a soap for a long time - I do get to change my image a lot". She said that she enjoys the feedback she receives from her style changes and when her latest style was aired and she had [...] "cut it into a short bob, I got so many tweets from people - some negative, but mostly positive thankfully". She said that she would be open to changing her image in future. Fox has also commented on Nancy's large tattoo on her back, which she deemed to be [...] "too masculine". Fox said that when she was initially on the serial she found it [...] "great to be different" [...] but felt that it was difficult playing the [...] "alternative" [...] character of Nancy when her colleagues were such [...] "gorgeous, glamourous women". The tattoo has since disappeared. Of the character's dress sense the Hollyoaks wardrobe department said [...] "Nancy Hayton has a unique distinctive look on Hollyoaks. She wears rich colours and vibrant patterns, which compliment [...] her slim shape".|$|E

60|$|The {{first day}} I {{worked in the}} bowling alley, the barkeeper, {{according}} to custom, called us boys up {{to have a drink}} after we had been setting up pins for several hours. The others asked for beer. I said I'd take ginger ale. The boys snickered, and I noticed the barkeeper favoured me with a strange, searching scrutiny. Nevertheless, he opened a bottle of ginger ale. Afterward, back in the alleys, in the pauses between games, the boys enlightened me. I had offended the barkeeper. A bottle of ginger ale cost the saloon ever so much more than a glass of steam beer; and it was up to <b>me,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> hold my job, to drink beer. Besides, beer was food. I could work better on it. There was no food in ginger ale. After that, when I couldn't sneak out of it, I drank beer and wondered what men found in it that was so good. I was always aware that I was missing something.|$|E

He asked me what squad number <b>I</b> <b>wanted,</b> and <b>I</b> said 22. But he must have thought I'd said 21 because he told <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> that number, <b>I</b> {{would have to go}} and speak with Ander Herrera.
