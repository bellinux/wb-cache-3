40|$|Revivals {{of optical}} {{coherence}} of <b>molecular</b> <b>photoassociation</b> driven by two ultrashort laser pulses are {{addressed in the}} Condon approach. Based on textbook examples and numerical simulation of KrF excimer molecules, a prediction is made about an existence of photon echo on free-bound transitions. Delayed {{rise and fall of}} nonlinear polarization in the half-collisions are to be resulted from the resonant quantum states interference whether it be in gas, liquid or solid phases.

40|$|It is {{possible}} to tune the scattering length for the collision of ultra-cold 1 S 0 ground state alkaline-earth atoms using an optical Feshbach resonance. This is achieved with a laser far detuned from an excited molecular level near {{the frequency of the}} atomic intercombination 1 S 0 [...] 3 P 1 transition. Simple resonant scattering theory, illustrated by the example of 40 Ca, allows an estimate of the magnitude of the effect. Unlike alkali metal species, large changes of the scattering length are possible while atom loss remains small, because of the very narrow line width of the <b>molecular</b> <b>photoassociation</b> transition. This raises prospects for control of atomic interactions for a system without magnetically tunable Feshbach resonance levels...|$|E
40|$|We {{calculate}} the light-induced collisional loss of laser-cooled and trapped magnesium atoms for detunings up to 50 atomic linewidths {{to the red}} of the ^ 1 S_ 0 -^ 1 P_ 1 cooling transition. We evaluate loss rate coefficients due to both radiative and nonradiative state-changing mechanisms for temperatures at and below the Doppler cooling temperature. We solve the Schrodinger equation with a complex potential to represent spontaneous decay, but also give analytic models for various limits. Vibrational structure due to <b>molecular</b> <b>photoassociation</b> {{is present in the}} trap loss spectrum. Relatively broad structure due to absorption to the Mg_ 2 ^ 1 Sigma_u state occurs for detunings larger than about 10 atomic linewidths. Much sharper structure, especially evident at low temperature, occurs even at smaller detunings due to of Mg_ 2 ^ 1 Pi_g absorption, which is weakly allowed due to relativistic retardation corrections to the forbidden dipole transition strength. We also perform model studies for the other alkaline earth species Ca, Sr, and Ba and for Yb, and find similar qualitative behavior as for Mg. Comment: 20 pages, RevTex, 13 eps figures embedde...|$|E
40|$|We discuss {{theoretically}} ion-atom collisions at {{low energy}} and predict {{the possibility of}} formation of cold <b>molecular</b> ion by <b>photoassociation.</b> We present results on radiative homo- and hetero-nuclear atom-ion cold collisions that reveal threshold behaviour of atom-ion systems.

40|$|We {{investigate}} theoretically the <b>molecular</b> yield in <b>photoassociation</b> of Bose-Einstein condensed sodium atoms {{for light}} intensities {{of the order}} of and above those applied in a recent experiment. Our results show that the rate at which ground state molecules may be formed saturates at high light intensities whereas the loss rate of condensate atoms does not. This is caused by the opposing roles of the short and long range pair correlations present near resonance {{under the influence of the}} laser and is crucial for the development of efficient photoassociation procedures in a condensate.

40|$|This review {{describes}} recent {{experimental and}} theoretical advances in forming molecules in ultracold gases of trapped alkali metal atoms, both by magnetic tuning through Feshbach resonances and by <b>photoassociation.</b> <b>Molecular</b> Bose-Einstein condensation of long-range states of both boson dimers and fermion dimers was achieved in 2002 - 3. Condensates of boson dimers {{were found to}} be short-lived, but long-lived condensates of fermion dimers have been produced. Signatures of triatomic and tetraatomic molecules have recently been observed. Both homonuclear and heteronuclear molecules have been formed by photoassociation, mostly in very high vibrational levels. Recent attempts to produce ultracold molecules in short-range states (low vibrational levels) are described. Experimental and theoretical work on collisions of ultracold molecules is discussed.

40|$|We {{experimentally}} investigate various processes {{present in}} the photoassociative interaction of an ultracold atomic sample with shaped femtosecond laser pulses as an detailed extension of previous work. We demonstrate the photoassociation of pairs of rubidium atoms into electronically excited, bound molecular states using spectrally cut femtosecond laser pulses tuned below the rubidium D 1 or D 2 asymptote. Time-resolved pump-probe spectra reveal oscillations of the molecular formation rate, which are due to coherent transient dynamics in the electronic excitation. The oscillation frequency corresponds to the detuning of the spectral cut position to the asymptotic transition frequency of the rubidium D 1 or D 2 lines, respectively. Measurements of the <b>molecular</b> <b>photoassociation</b> signal {{as a function of}} the pulse energy reveal a nonlinear dependence and indicate a nonperturbative excitation process. Chirping the association laser pulse allowed us to change the phase of the coh erent transients. Furthermore, a signature for molecules in the electronic ground state is found, which is attributed to molecule formation by femtosecond photoassociation followed by spontaneous decay. In a subsequent article quantum mechanical calculations are presented, which compare well with the experimental data and reveal further details about the observed coherent transient dynamics...|$|E
40|$|Ultracold atomic physics oﬀers an experimentalist the {{opportunity}} to perform sensitive tests and measurements that are not possible at higher temperatures. In this case it allows for access to <b>molecular</b> states, through <b>photoassociation,</b> that are inaccessible to conventional techniques. We use photoassociation to measure quasi-bound levels of the 2 1 Σg+ state of 85 Rb 2. With these data, we examine a coupling between the short-range Hund’s case (c) 2 (0 g+) component and the long-range 2 (1 g) state, which corresponds to the 1 1 Πg state. A second experiment studies the mechanism of short-range photoassociation and ﬁnds our simple model to have strong predictive power. In a third experiment, we photoassociatively form vibrationally excited a 3 Σu+ molecules. We then excite these molecules using a frequency-doubled pulse-ampliﬁed CW laser to create low-n long-range Rydberg states of 85 Rb 2. Autoionization and ion detection of these states gives high-resolution spectra, which are compared to theoretical potential curves...|$|R
40|$|We {{theoretically}} examine Raman photoassociation of a Bose-Einstein condensate, revisiting stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP). Due to collisional mean-field shifts, efficient molecular conversion requires {{strong coupling}} and low density, either {{of which can}} bring about rogue photodissociation to noncondensate modes. We demonstrate explicitly that rogue transitions are negligible for low excited-state fractions and photodissociation that is slower than the STIRAP timescale. Moreover, we derive a reduced-parameter model of collisions, and thereby find that a gain in the molecular conversion efficiency {{can be obtained by}} adjusting the atom-atom scattering length with off-resonant magnetoassociation. This gain saturates when the atom-atom scattering length is tuned to a specific fraction of either the molecule-molecule or atom-molecule scattering length. We conclude that a fully-optimized STIRAP scheme may offer the best chance for achieving coherent conversion from an atomic to a <b>molecular</b> condensate with <b>photoassociation.</b> Comment: 8 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, 54 + references; accepted to PRA; v 2 title changed (at editor's behest), 2 references added (to MIT formation of degenerate molecule from BEC...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 This {{dissertation}} {{describes a}} series of experiments conducted in an ultracold mixture of fermionic 6 Li and bosonic 174 Yb atoms, {{with a focus on}} the creation of heteronuclear YbLi molecules and the realization of a mixture of Bose and Fermi superfluids. Measurements of field-dependent inelastic scattering between metastable (3 P 2) Yb and ground state (2 S 1 / 2) Li are discussed, revealing the existence of interspecies Feshbach resonances which in principle may be used to create ultracold YbLi molecules in a coherent fashion, but in practice exhibit prohibitively large inelastic loss in the specific scattering channel used. An alternative all-optical two-photon pathway to ground state YbLi molecules is also explored, with the initial results presented here being the exploration of excited state YbLi <b>molecular</b> potentials using <b>photoassociation</b> spectroscopy, and the successful production of YbLi* molecules in a dual-species magneto-optical trap. An upgraded crossed optical dipole trap is implemented on the Yb-Li experimental apparatus, with a novel application of time-averaged potential shaping for very rapid and efficient Yb BEC production. Lastly, we detail the realization of an interacting mixture of Bose and Fermi superfluids, and identify the exchange of angular momentum between the superfluids by the excitation of a rotational mode of oscillation in the bosonic component due to interspecies interactions...|$|R
