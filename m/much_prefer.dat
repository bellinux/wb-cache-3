5|$|There is no {{consistent}} {{relationship between}} the classification of spiders {{and the types of}} web they build: species in the same genus may build very similar or significantly different webs. Nor is there much correspondence between spiders' classification and the chemical composition of their silks. Convergent evolution in web construction, in other words use of similar techniques by remotely related species, is rampant. Orb web designs and the spinning behaviors that produce them are the best understood. The basic radial-then-spiral sequence visible in orb webs and the sense of direction required to build them may have been inherited from the common ancestors of most spider groups. However, the majority of spiders build non-orb webs. It used to be thought that the sticky orb web was an evolutionary innovation resulting in the diversification of the Orbiculariae. Now, however, it appears that non-orb spiders are a sub-group that evolved from orb-web spiders, and non-orb spiders have over 40% more species and are four times as abundant as orb-web spiders. Their greater success may be because sphecid wasps, which are often the dominant predators of spiders, <b>much</b> <b>prefer</b> to attack spiders that have flat webs.|$|E

2500|$|More {{than merely}} {{a great player}} or manager, Cruyff is also {{regarded}} as a great thinker who officially founded and represented a distinctive school of thought in football and a style/way of playing that is predominant today. Generally seen as a highly influential ideological figure in the football world, Cruyff was also a brilliant tactical innovator in history of the game. Writing in his weekly blog for , Spanish international midfielder Juan Mata, a graduate of Real Madrid's youth academy, hails Cruyff's overall footballing vision, “I consider him [...] the ideological father of the football; the one I try to play like and the one I look to learn from as a spectator whenever I watch a game. The intelligent use of the ball and the spaces, the importance of talent over the physical condition and the understanding of football as a team sport are concepts that I definitely endorse.” His influence at Ajax and Barcelona went beyond his playing and managerial spells as he helped shape the footballing philosophy/identity of both clubs. This {{is not about the}} power of money. It is about the power of ideas – and one grand idea in particular. It has almost become modern Barcelona’s creation myth: how Johan Cruyff descended from the heavens to create a club in his own image and instill a belief system which even to this day creates religious fervour. Enrique may have tinkered with aspects of Barcelona's approach but the fundamentals remain in place. [...] It is the idea of La Masia and the idea of football played in line with Cruyffian ethics – an ideological position on the mode of production and the style of play. First aroused by the Dream Team in 1992 it was reignited by a new generation: Lionel Messi, Xavi and Andres Iniesta, who have won the Champions League in 2006, 2009, 2011 and 2015. |date=7 June 2015 |accessdate=10 July 2016}} It is difficult to overstate the impact he had. His own natural vision for the game, the concepts of Rinus Michels' Total Football, and the experiences gleaned in a 20-year playing career formed the blueprint, but his great merit was to synthesize and tweak it to suit Catalan football. The building blocks were possession, pressing and proactivity, the idea that the opposition would adjust to you, not the other way around. [...] The concept was that football was something to be done right, or not done at all. A quote often attributed to him – possibly apocryphal, but nevertheless truer than so much of what managers say – was that he'd rather play well and lose than play poorly and win. [...] For Cruyff, playing well suggested adhering to certain fundamental canons of style and execution. That Cruyff [...] "idea of football" [...] has come to mean many things to many people. It's almost easier to define it by what it is not: It's not a philosophy based on waiting for your opponent to make a mistake, unless it's a mistake that you cause them to make through your own excellence. |date=24 March 2016 |accessdate=2 July 2016 }} La Masia, Barça's youth academy, was the brainchild of Cruyff. As a prominent graduate from the famed Ajax Youth Academy, he always believed using regularly young home-grown players in first-team squad. He established a unique model at La Masia where the youth players could grow up and have a better chance {{to be part of the}} senior team, as they would already be accustomed to the style of play. As former La Masia technical director Pep Segura said of Cruyff: “It is about creating one philosophy, one mentality, from the bottom of the club to the top. Cruyff is the one who started it all. He has been the club's most influential figure. We all have the ability to do certain things, but I would not have been able to build something from scratch like Cruyff did. I learned a lot of things from him. I cannot imagine the current Barcelona without Cruyff's work.” The style of play Cruyff introduced at Barcelona came to be known as tiki-taka “I <b>much</b> <b>prefer</b> to win 5–4 than 1–0” said the erstwhile manager, and set about finding the players that fit his ideology. This was 1988 when players were chosen for their physique, or more accurately, not chosen because of it. Even Barcelona had 'a prueba de la muneca' – the wrist test – that discounted anyone at 15 who didn’t look like growing to be at least 5’11. [...] Cruyff changed that, focussing instead on ability and technique, cultivating players who treated the ball with care, were quick and pressed the opposition. One benefactor of this new policy was a skinny 15 year-old named Pep Guardiola, who would play an integral part in the club’s first European Cup success as a player in 1992, then manage the team in their most successful period ever. “Johan Cruyff painted the chapel, and Barcelona coaches since merely restore or improve it”, was how Pep put it. The Dutch master was the Godfather of La Masia, Barça’s talent factory that has since become a production line of footballing prodigies. They play 3–4–3 from the under-8’s all the way to the senior side, a continuity that has served the club well. |date=24 March 2016 |accessdate=10 July 2016}} — characterised by short passing and movement, working the ball through various channels, and maintaining possession — which was adopted by UEFA Euro 2008-, 2010 World Cup- and Euro 2012-winning Spain national team.
