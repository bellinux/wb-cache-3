40|$|It {{is found}} {{that use of}} acetone in place of acetic acid in the {{reaction}} with isobutyric acid is effective for the synthesis of the cross-ketonization product, <b>methyl</b> <b>isopropyl</b> <b>ketone</b> (MIPK). Rate of MIPK formation is of the same order of magnitude, but slightly lower for acetone compared to acetic acid under similar conditions (Fig. 1). The most active catalyst is KOH-treated titania. The second product of this reaction, DIPK, results from the ketonic decarboxylative condensation of isobutyric acid with itself. The 13 C labeled carbonyl group from isobutyric acid is almost exclusively (within the detection error) transferred to the MIPK product (Scheme 2). In the reaction of acetic acid with a more branched ketone, DIPK, only a negligible amount of MIPK is produced with all studied catalysts. Based on the experimental data, the proposed mechanism most likely includes enolization of acetone, followed by its condensation as the nucleophile with isobutyric acid as the electrophile, and completed by the retro-condensation to MIPK (Scheme 2). The order of the enolic components activity, acetic acid ≥ isobutyric acid 3 ̆e acetone 3 ̆e 3 ̆e DIPK, is generally consistent with the order of their adsorption energies on metal oxides. Low or non-branched ketones could be efficiently used in place {{of one of the}} acids in the cross-ketonization reaction.

Both compounds were found to enhance NO oxidation and O 3 formation rates under all conditions, though relatively large amounts of dimethyl carbonate had to be added to have measurable effects. The addition of <b>methyl</b> <b>isopropyl</b> carbonate caused increased formation of formaldehyde and acetone, while dimethyl carbonate had no effects on formaldehyde or other organic products that could be monitored.

Atmospheric reaction mechanisms for these compounds were developed using the measured OH radical rate constants and estimates for the subsequent reactions.

The hydrogen bonding {{ability of}} the cyclic amines, {{as well as the}} reduced degrees of rotational freedom, allows for the formation of proton-bound homodimers inside of the assembly which are otherwise not observable in aqueous solution. The generality of homodimer formation was explored with small N-alkyl aziridines, azetidines, pyrrolidines and piperidines.
