40|$|Ballast {{water has}} been a {{principal}} pathway of non-indigenous species introduction to global ports {{for much of the}} 20 th century. In an effort to reduce the scale of this pathway, and recognizing forthcoming global regulations that will supplant ballast water exchange (BWE) with ballast water treatment (BWT), we explore whether a combined hybrid treatment of BWE and chlorination (Cl) exceeds individual effects of either BWE or chlorination alone in reducing densities of bacteria, microplankton and <b>macroplankton.</b> Five full-scale trials were conducted on an operational bulk carrier travelling between Canada and Brazil. The hybrid treatment generally had the lowest final densities among all treatments for putative enterococci, Escherichia coli and coliform bacteria, as well as microplankton and <b>macroplankton,</b> with the former two being synergistically lower than individual treatments alone. Microplankton abundance in the hybrid treatment was significantly but antagonistically reduced relative to individual treatments alone. <b>Macroplankton</b> final density was lowest in the hybrid treatment, though the interaction between treatments was not significant.

40|$|Vertical {{distribution}} of meso- and <b>macroplankton</b> was {{studied in the}} region of the most sharply pronounced climatic frontal zone between the Gulf Stream and the Labrador current. Hauls with a plankton net BR 113 / 140 and visual counts of <b>macroplankton</b> from the Mir submersible were used. In the frontal zone a contact occurs between arctic-boreal communities and communities of the North Atlantic subtropical gyre. The community of the North Atlantic subtropical gyre is more mature in terms of succession; many macroplanktonic carnivores-scavengers (mainly shrimps Acanthephyra) develop there and form a ''living network'' feeding on those transported from the north rich arctic-boreal mesoplankton. As a result biomass of shrimps appears to be significantly higher than biomass of their preys. Peculiarities of vertical distribution and population structure of shrimps were analyzed. Data on quantitative vertical {{distribution of}} total biomass of meso- and <b>macroplankton</b> and its principal groups, including gelatinous animals (ctenophores, medusas, and siphonophores) were obtained.

[...] 1 pageThe {{composition}} of the near-bottom <b>macroplankton</b> and micronekton, with especial emphasis on eucarid and peracarid crustaceans and fish, of the Galicia Bank (NW Spain) was analysed in Jul-Aug 2010 and 2011 at 730 - 2230 m. WP 2 nets, equipped with an opening-closing system and 0. 5 mm mesh-size, and beam trawls (10 mm mesh size) were used. Environmental variables (temperature, salinity, oxygen) were collected at near-bottom. Relationship between abundance patterns and environmental variables was explored by GLMs/Spearman/CCA. <b>Macroplankton</b> community was estructured {{as a function of}} depth, with different species at summit (to c. 800 m) and deeper, over the seamount flanks. Tendencies related with diel cycle and year, i. e. higher abundance of the euphausiid Euphausia krohni in 2010, were recorded. The <b>macroplankton</b> was dominated by the hyperiid Themisto gaudichaudi. The mysid Eucopia hanseni was also important at the summit, while the gammarid Cyphocaris anonyx was dominant in the flanks. The micronekton community was homogenous to 1100 m, with a different community at 1400 ¿ 1800 m. Systellaspis debilis was important at all depths. Gnatophausia zoea was also dominant in shallow stations while Acantephyra purpurea and Meganyctiphanes norvegica were found deeper. Trends in abundance and diveristy were related with oxygen concentration. Total zooplankton biomass, i. e. including all gelatinuos taxa was higher in the summit (3. 75 gWW/ 1000 m 3) and over flanks (3. 05 gWW/ 1000 m 3) at 1420 - 2230 m, with minimum biomass at intermediate depths (890 - 1080 m, 2. 02 gWW/ 1000 m 3), coinciding with the Mediterranean Outlow Water (MOW) with minimals in O 2 content (4. 2 ml/l) at c. 1000 m.

Here we studied, {{for the first time in}} the aquatic literature, the succession of marine plankton in the whole-plankton assemblage that spanned 5 orders of magnitude in size from microbes to <b>macroplankton</b> predators (not including fish or fish lar-vae, for which no consistent data were available). Samples were collected in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea (Bay of Villefranche) weekly during 10 months. Simultaneously collected samples were analyzed by flow cytometry, inverse microscopy, FlowCam, and ZooScan. The whole-plankton assemblage underwent sharp reorganizations that corresponded to bottom-up events of vertical mixing in the water-column, and its development was top-down controlled by large gelatinous filter feeders and predators. Based on the results provided by our novel whole-plankton assemblage approach, we propose a new comprehensive conceptual model of the annual plankton succession (i. e. whole plankton model) characterized by both stepwise stacking of four broad trophic communities from early spring through summer, which is a new concept, and progressive replacement of ecological plankton categories within the different trophic communities, as recognised traditionally...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION From mid-January 1961 {{until the}} end of 1966 <b>macroplankton</b> was {{collected}} by the crew of "Texel" lightship (position: 53 ° 01 ' 30 "Ν 04 ° 22 ' E) and identified afterwards in the Nederlands Instituut voor Onderzoek der Zee, at that time still in Den Helder. The nets, of Saran gauze with a 2 mm mesh and an opening of 1 m 2, were originally intended for catching elvers, for investigations reported upon by Creutzberg, 1961. The original aim of the present plankton project was to catch Scyphomedusae, but soon after it had been started all the available <b>macroplankton</b> was sorted out and, if possible, identified. This explains why the decapod larvae, dealt with in the present paper, came to be collected by nets, quite unfit for that purpose. When the meshes are open, most of the smaller larvae can pass through, but when they are blocked, e. g. by algae or, as happens to be the case in midsummer, by enormous quantities of echinoderm larvae, then great quantities of smaller organisms may suddenly turn up in the catches. Therefore the number of larvae caught does not give a reliable picture of the numbers actually present in the plankton. The postlarval and the later stages of the Natantia have been identified by the second author (H.). The identification of the adult Reptantia has also been checked by him. The larvae of the Reptantia have been identified by the third author (S.). The identification is based on the keys and descriptions as given by Lebour (1928, 1943, 1944) and by MacDonald, Pike & Williamson (1957).

However, {{the role of the}} pelagic fauna to fuel the bathypelagic zone, the layer where effective carbon sequestration occurs, is largely unknown. Here we report net zooplankton biomass in the meso- and bathypelagic zones showing significant relationships with primary production (PP) at a global scale during the Malaspina Circumnavigation Expedition. We also reviewed available data on zooplankton biomass at the different biogeographical provinces also showing significant correlations with large-scale estimates of PP, implying the transference of a significant fraction of PP from the epipelagic to the deep ocean. Carbon sequestration assessed only from conservative estimates of zooplankton mortality in the bathypelagic was 0. 43 PgC y- 1, in the order of recent estimates of gravitational carbon sequestration. These values and those recently reviewed due to lipid consumption almost triples ocean carbon sequestration estimates in Westerlies and Polar biomes. These results point at a pivotal role of the pelagic fauna in ocean carbon sequestration as, besides zooplankton, downward transport by <b>macroplankton</b> and micronekton should also be accounted for. Our results {{raises the question of whether}} we are severely underestimating carbon sequestration in the ocea...|$|E
40|$|Pelagic Crenarchaeota produce {{glycerol}} dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) as membrane lipids, and the GDGT composition changes {{according to}} growth temperature. This {{forms the basis}} of the TEX 86 paleotemperature proxy. This ratio correlates with sea surface temperature (SST) despite the fact that Crenarchaeota are distributed through the water column. Therefore there must be mechanisms that transport the surface signal to sediments such as repackaging in fecal pellets, marine snow, mass falls after phytoplankton blooms, or daily migration. To study GDGT transport, we analyzed stomachs and intestines of Atlantic and Mediterranean decapods as they are one of the major megafaunal groups, are easy to sample, and occur in both pelagic and benthic environments. GDGTs were found in most decapods’ guts. GDGT abundances are significantly lower in intestines, but TEX 86 -derived temperatures are not significantly different between stomachs and intestines (< 1 C), suggesting that TEX 86 values are not altered during gut transit. Atlantic decapods show no difference in TEX 86 values between benthic detritivors and pelagic predators. However, Mediterranean decapods show a substantial difference between <b>macroplankton</b> feeders and bentho-pelagic predators. This is probably related to the freshness of the material consumed. TEX 86 -derived temperatures in Atlantic decapods are close to the SST around the time of sampling, in agreement with stomach content analysis that shows fresh organic matter being ingested. For Mediterranean decapods, TEX 86 temperatures are significantly higher than SST around the time of sampling. This can be partly attributed to the large variability between decapod specimens and the low amounts of fresh material found in their stomachs...|$|E
40|$|From mid-January 1961 {{until the}} end of 1966 <b>macroplankton</b> was {{collected}} in the surface water of the North Sea around "Texel" lightship (position: 53 ° 01 ' 3 o"N 04 ° 22 'E). As pointed out in a recent paper on decapod larvae (Van der Baan, Holthuis & Schrieken, 1972) the plankton nets were originally intended for collecting elvers and medusae, and the numbers of smaller species obtained, such as larvae and also Cumacea, was greatly influenced by incidental circumstances. Therefore no great significance can be attached to the actual numbers of these smaller animals. Cumacea are mostly bottom-dwelling species, and cannot regularly be expected in surface waters. Still, four species were found in our samples viz. : Diastylis bradyi Norman, 1879 Iphinoe trispinosa (Goodsir, 1843) Pseudocuma similis G. O. Sars, 1900 Bodotria scorpioides (Montagu, 1804) The last two species are very small. They were only held back by the nets in a very few cases, when the meshes got clogged by great quantities of algae or various animal species. According to Zimmer all the above species belong to those Cumacea which are found throughout the North Sea (Zimmer, 1933 : 11 o) and also to the species which, by vertical migration, {{can be found at the}} surface at night, especially during the reproductive periods. The only specimen of Bodotria scorpioides was caught in the evening, in a flood haul. Of the 15 hauls in which Pseudocuma similis occurred, 3 were made by day, the others completely or partly during the dark hours...|$|E
40|$|The deep-pelagic (incl. meso- and bathypelagic) domain {{has been}} {{historically}} sampled using relatively small research trawls (ring nets, modified otter trawls, rectangular trawls, International Young Gadoid Trawls, and MOCNESS trawls), which have shaped {{what we know}} about midwater taxa. The towing speed, effective mouth area, and mesh sizes of the gears mentioned mainly select for <b>macroplankton</b> and micronekton, as larger nekton can outswim or outmaneuver these nets. Researchers are increasingly using larger, commercial-sized high speed rope trawls to sample the deep-pelagial. An example is the Offshore Nekton Sampling and Analysis Program (ONSAP), a component of NOAA’s Natural Resource Damage Assessment following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The ONSAP employed two types of midwater trawls to collect deep-pelagic fauna in the northern Gulf of Mexico between 0 - 1500 meters depth; a 10 -m 2 MOCNESS (MOC 10) and a commercial-sized, high-speed Irish Herring Trawl (IHT). Data will be presented comparing the catches of the Chiasmodontidae, a top meso/bathypelagic predator family, from the two gear types. The IHT collected 1, 060 specimens in 146 of 167 trawls (87 % frequency), compared to only 87 specimens collected by the MOC 10 in 68 of 241 trawls (28 % frequency). A minimum of 15 species of chiasmodontids were collected with the IHT (currently all Chiasmodon identifications are C. niger complex, pending revision), while eight were collected with the MOC 10. Comparisons of standardized abundance and length frequencies will be presented as evidence and incentive for employing multiple trawl types to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the deep-pelagial, earth’s largest biome...|$|E
40|$|International audienceLong-term {{variability}} {{of the main}} calycophoran siphonophores was investigated between 1974 and 1999 in a coastal station in the north-western Mediterranean. The data were collected at weekly frequency using a <b>macroplankton</b> net (680 μm mesh size) adapted to quantitatively sample delicate gelatinous plankton. A three-year collection (1967 - 69) of siphonophores from offshore waters using the same methodology showed that the patterns of variability observed inshore were representative of siphonophores' changes at a regional scale. The aims of the study were: (i) to investigate the patterns of variability that characterised the dominant calycophoran species and assemblages; (ii) to identify the environmental optima that were associated with {{a significant increase in}} the dominant siphonophore species and (iii) to verify the influence of hydroclimatic variability on long-term changes of siphonophores. Our results showed that during nearly thirty years the standing stock of calycophoran siphonophores did not show any significant change, with the annual maximum usually recorded in spring as a result of high densities of the dominant species Lensia subtilis, Muggiaea kochi and Muggiaea atlantica. Nevertheless, major changes in community composition occurred within the calycophoran population. Since the middle 1980 s, M. kochi, once the most dominant species, started to decrease allowing other species, the congeneric M. atlantica and Chelophyes appendiculata, to increasingly dominate in spring and summer-autumn, respectively. The comparison of environmental and biotic long-term trends suggests that the decrease of M. kochi was triggered by hydrological changes that occurred in the north-western Mediterranean under the forcing of large-scale climate oscillations. Salinity, water stratification and water temperature were the main hydroclimatic factors associated with a significant increase of siphonophores, different species showing different environmental preferences...|$|E
40|$|Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and salps {{are major}} <b>macroplankton</b> {{contributors}} to Southern Ocean food webs and krill are also fished commercially. Managing this fishery sustainably, {{against a backdrop}} of rapid regional climate change, requires information on distribution and time trends. Many data on the abundance of both taxa have been obtained from net sampling surveys since 1926, but much of this is stored in national archives, sometimes only in notebooks. In order to make these important data accessible we have collated available abundance data (numerical density, no.  m− 2) of postlarval E. superba and salp individual (multiple species, and whether singly or in chains). These were combined into a central database, KRILLBASE, together with environmental information, standardisation and metadata. The aim is to provide a temporal-spatial data resource to support a variety of research such as biogeochemistry, autecology, higher predator foraging and food web modelling in addition to fisheries management and conservation. Previous versions of KRILLBASE have led to a series of papers since 2004 which illustrate some of the potential uses of this database. With increasing numbers of requests for these data we here provide an updated version of KRILLBASE that contains data from 15   194 net hauls, including 12   758 with krill abundance data and 9726 with salp abundance data. These data were collected by 10 nations and span 56 seasons in two epochs (1926 – 1939 and 1976 – 2016). Here, we illustrate the seasonal, inter-annual, regional and depth coverage of sampling, and provide both circumpolar- and regional-scale distribution maps. Krill abundance data have been standardised to accommodate variation in sampling methods, and we have presented these as well as the raw data. Information is provided on how to screen, interpret and use KRILLBASE to reduce artefacts in interpretation, with contact points for the main data providers...|$|E
