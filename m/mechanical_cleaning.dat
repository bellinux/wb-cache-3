25|$|Mechanical {{methods include}} dusting, picking and cutting, and abrading. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>cleaning</b> is {{typically}} {{much easier to}} control than chemical treatments {{and there is no}} danger of dirt being drawn into a solution and then absorbed by the ceramic. The danger of <b>mechanical</b> <b>cleaning</b> is the potential for the surface to break or become scratched with a tool. Dusting is used when dirt is not strongly adhered {{to the surface of the}} ceramic and is carried out by either a brush or a soft cloth. Large ceramic vessels are cleaned with delicate vacuum cleaner with a soft, muslin-covered head. Picking and cutting is used when there are hardened dirt, encrustations, or old restoration materials closely adheres to the surface. Needles, sharp scalpels, other custom made tools, usually made from wood, and electric vibrotools are used. The dangers with these tools are the increase potential for scratches, gouges, cracking, and breaking of the object due to pressure.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{objective}} of this review was to summarize the available evidence regarding the effects of <b>mechanical</b> tongue <b>cleaning</b> compared with no <b>mechanical</b> tongue <b>cleaning</b> on breath odour and tongue coating (TC). Methods: PubMed-MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane-CENTRAL were searched to identify potentially relevant studies. The inclusion criteria included the following: randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) conducted in humans in good general health (no systemic disorders) and a patient age of 17 years. For the intervention, we considered tongue cleaning [the use of a tongue scraper (TS) or tongue brush (TB) ] and for the control, brushing only (B) groups. Clinical parameters such as volatile sulphur compound concentration, organoleptic scores and TC were the outcome variables of interest. Study selection, quality assessment and data extraction were carried out by two independent reviewers. Results: After screening of the titles and abstracts and subsequent full text reading of the potential papers, we identified five publications that met the eligibility criteria and provided seven experiments. The five studies consisted of three RCTs and two CCTs. All experiments show a positive effect of <b>mechanical</b> tongue <b>cleaning</b> in addition to toothbrushing on various parameters of oral malodour. Conclusions: This review demonstrated that mechanical approaches, such as tongue brushing or tongue scraping to clean the dorsum of the tongue, {{have the potential to}} successfully reduce breath odour and TC. However, data concerning the effect of <b>mechanical</b> tongue <b>cleaning</b> on chronic oral malodour (halitosis) are insufficient...|$|R

40|$|AIM: The study {{objective}} was to collect diagnostic data, to explore correlations between diagnostic variables, to provide an accurate initial diagnosis, and to provide appropriate management in consecutive subjects consulting with a multidisciplinary halitosis team because of a halitosis complaint. METHOD: Nine hundred and fifty-four subjects with halitosis complaints applied for consultation. Subjects' history data were collected and organoleptic measurements and a physical examination were performed. Finally, genuine halitosis or pseudo-halitosis/halitophobia was diagnosed initially and management was provided. RESULT: Genuine oral halitosis was diagnosed initially in 93 % of cases. Using oral <b>cleaning</b> materials, performing <b>mechanical</b> tongue <b>cleaning,</b> and periodical dentist consultation were over-represented in women, whereas men {{were more likely to}} have observable biofilm and carious lesions than women. Female gender was associated with tongue coating. Positive associations were found between age and performing <b>mechanical</b> tongue <b>cleaning,</b> organoleptic measurement scores as well as poor oral health. Educational level was positively associated with oral self care behaviours. Performing <b>mechanical</b> tongue <b>cleaning</b> was not associated with periodical dentist consultation.

40|$|Beaches {{belong to}} the least studied ecosystems, {{although}} they contain typical habitats for {{a large amount of}} specialised terrestrial invertebrates. This specific beach fauna was quite diverse along the Belgian coast {{at the beginning of the}} twentieth century. Especially species bound to organic matter, washed up on the tide line, were well represented. As a result of the development of mass tourism, most of our beaches are subject to <b>mechanical</b> beach <b>cleaning</b> and the suppletion of sand. These activities are believed to be responsible for the degradation of the original habitat. However, documentation on this topic was scarce and evidence of negative effects on local biodiversity was lacking. Therefore, the main goal of this research was to make an inventory of the terrestrial arthropod fauna on Flemish beaches and analysing temporal and spatial variation, in function of abiotic components such as the degree of recreation and the intensity of <b>mechanical</b> beach <b>cleaning.</b> The main conclusion is that a high degree of recreation and <b>mechanical</b> beach <b>cleaning</b> indeed has a negative influence on the richness of the species bound to organic detritus and also induces a change in community structure of terrestrial invertebrates along the Flemish coast. Secondly, predators and even parasites are also indirectly influenced by these anthropogenic disturbances, as a result of the declining prey population. Excluding or at least reducing these impacts along certain sections of the Flemish coast, might ensure the preservation of the organic detritus on the tide line and hence its associated beach fauna...|$|R

40|$|A {{study on}} beach {{cleaning}} in Belgium was conducted {{from a social}} and biological perspective, to confront {{the lack of information}} regarding the two methods used: manual and <b>mechanical</b> beach <b>cleaning.</b> Through direct participation in the pilot project on manual beach cleaning of the municipality of Koksijde, during summer 2004, around 42 kg of man-made waste/km/month were estimated during July and September, and 87 kg during August. An average 1. 5 h/km was needed for two persons to manually clean the beach. In average, plastics represented more than 50 % of the weight of the waste, and textiles from 16 to 21 %. Strict measures should be taken regarding the disposal of plastic; this would in turn reduce the time and costs of manual beach cleaning. The results of a public perception study on beach cleanness and the strandline material, conducted in Koksijde in 2004, showed that aesthetics do {{play an important role in}} attracting beach users. More than 80 % of beach users would like metal, plastic, glass, rubber, polystyrene, paper and textiles to be removed during beach cleaning, while algae were only chosen by 4 %. The natural material of the strandline was appreciated by 76 % of respondents and 87 % agreed that only artificial strand line material be removed during beach cleaning. The manually cleaned beach was just as visited as the mechanically cleaned one, and was not considered less clean. Belgian coastal communities should therefore consider the tourist potential of offering and promoting a more natural beach, to attract a relatively high proportion of visitors. Finally, in situ experiments were carried out in De Panne to determine the direct effects of <b>mechanical</b> beach <b>cleaning</b> on the strandline macro fauna. No significant effects of the different combinations of speed and pressure of the beach cleaning machine were detected neither on dipteran larvae and pupae (the dominant group), nor on total organism counts, compared to initial conditions. The number of organisms was not significantly reduced after one cleaning event. However, the presence of these organisms was significantly and directly related to the presence of algae. The main problems posed by <b>mechanical</b> beach <b>cleaning</b> are the immediate loss of habitat for the strandline associated fauna, and possible long-term impacts on the recovery of the populations if beach cleaning is continuous over the year. A zonal coastal management approach is recommended, which would allow areas with only manual cleaning interspersed with areas of <b>mechanical</b> beach <b>cleaning.</b> Such an approach would serve not only to attract tourists who prefer more natural beaches, but also to conserve, restore and enhance habitats and biodiversity in Belgian sandy beaches...|$|R
