40|$|With its new {{features}} such as multi-homing and <b>multi-streaming</b> the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) has become a promising candidate as a general-purpose transport layer protocol. Multi-homing in an SCTP association can make concurrent multi-path transfer an appealing candidate to satisfy the ever increasing user demands for bandwidth. Multiple streams provide an aggregation mechanism to accommodate heterogeneous objects, which {{belong to the same}} application but may require different QoS from the network.

40|$|Abstract—Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) {{introduces}} the <b>multi-streaming</b> feature {{to avoid the}} head-of-line (HOL) blocking problem of TCP and facilitate the transport of signaling messages over the Internet. However, the current protocol specification does not define how multiple streams should be scheduled and implementations are different across platforms.

In this paper, we propose to augment the <b>multi-streaming</b> feature of SCTP with pluggable scheduling so that users can customize the multi-stream scheduling algorithm of SCTP to satisfy their application-specific demands. We implement our proposal in the Linux kernel and show that this extension greatly increases the flexibility of SCTP and brings visible performance enhancements. This is the first work that demonstrates the effectiveness of pluggable SCTP multi-stream scheduling through real implementations and testbed experiments. Our proposal requires modifications only on the sender side and incurs no interoperability or fairness problems. Hence, it is safe and convenient to be deployed in the current Internet. I...|$|E

THE <b>MULTI-STREAM</b> CONCEPT In conventional ASR systems, all the elements of the feature vector are treated as one entity by the classifier.

An additional auxiliary field is used to model the degree of asynchrony among the feature streams. The individual feature streams can be linear sequences such as fixed-frame-rate features in traditional hidden Markov model (HMM) systems, and the feature streams can also be directed acyclic graphs such as segment features in segment-based systems. In a single-tape mode, this <b>multi-stream</b> framework also unifies the frame-based HMM and the segment-based approach.

Vector, {{emerging}} (homogenous and heterogeneous) multi-core and {{a number}} of accelerator processing devices potentially offer an order of magni-tude speedup for scientific applications that are capable of exploiting their SIMD execution units over microprocessor execution times.

The conventional performance modeling strategies are unable to capture the performance characteristics of complex processing systems and, therefore, fail to predict achievable runtime performance. More-over, most efforts involved in developing a performance modeling strategy and subsequently a framework for unique and emerging processing devices is pro-hibitively expensive.
