A more advanced case of electronic gearing is electronic camming. With electronic camming, a slave axis follows a profile that {{is a function of the}} master position. This profile need not be salted, but it must be an animated function ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the <b>master</b> <b>axis</b> {{method of}} machine tool spindle {{measurement}} is described. This method allows spindle measurements {{to be carried}} out at speed and under load. For example, a radial load representing the cutting force in a turning operation can be conveniently applied during characterization of a lathe spindle. The synchronous and asynchronous error motions have been observed to vary in both magnitude and shape with changes in load. Test results from both static and dynamic loads during testing are shown to demonstrate th...|$|E

This paper simulated the virtual master shaft {{based on the}} analysis of the working principle and the existing problems of the {{hydraulic press}} brake as well as based on the application of the virtual shaft algorithm in motion control, which directly drive the synchronous system of the hydraulic press brake. We established the model of the virtual <b>master</b> <b>axis</b> and the model of the hydraulic press brake which based on the virtual shaft algorithm, and simulated the models in Mat lab. We obtain the better effect in the accuracy and combination propert...|$|E

40|$|This work {{demonstrates}} {{techniques that}} advance the standard practice in spindle metrology and enable five degree-of-freedom calibration of precision spindles with nanometer-level error motion. Several improvements {{are described in}} this paper: (1) an improved implementation of Donaldson and Estler reversal that eliminates moving and realigning the displacement sensor, (2) frequency domain low-pass filtering of data to remove spectral content without distortion, (3) robust removal of low frequency components caused by thermal drift and fluctuations in air bearing supply pressure, and (4) three-dimensional display of the synchronous error motion in the radial and axial directions. Example measurements demonstrate the repeatability and reproducibility of the techniques. Furthermore, synchronous radial error motion of an air bearing spindle calibrated by multi-step, master artifact, and <b>master</b> <b>axis</b> techniques agree within 1 nm...|$|E

It is a direct sequel to Axis of Evil and {{introduces}} new puppets named Blitzkrieg, Bombshell, Kamikaze and Weremacht, who fight alongside the Nazis. It was released on October 9, 2012 by Full Moon Features.|$|R

[...] Upon its release, Full Moon also released Puppet Master: Axis of Evil in a collector's set with the original Puppet Master in its original widescreen format on June 15. The set includes packaging resembling Toulon's trunk, a poster for Axis of Evil, mini-poster cards {{for all of the}} films in the series, and stickers featuring each puppet. The set is available on DVD and Blu-ray, marking Full Moon's first foray into the Blu-ray market, including both the original Puppet <b>Master</b> and <b>Axis</b> of Evil.|$|R

Spawned seven sequels: Puppet Master II, Puppet Master III: Toulons Revenge, Puppet Master 4, and Puppet Master 5: The Final Chapter during the Full Moon Entertainment era, Curse of the Puppet Master and Retro Puppet Master during the Full Moon Pictures era, and Puppet Master: The Legacy during the Full Moon Features era. A Made for TV film titled [...] Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys [...] was also released for Sci Fi Channel in 2004; this was under the Shadow Entertainment era as well. Released in 2010 was Puppet Master: Axis of Evil and Puppet <b>Master</b> X: <b>Axis</b> Rising was released in 2012.|$|R

In June 2008, Band announced that a ninth installment of the series is planned, tentatively subtitled Axis of Evil. In March 2009, {{it was reported that}} Band is also interested in remaking 1989's Puppet Master in 3-D. Similarly, the original film was reissued by Razor Digital in 2007 in DualDisc format, featuring both standard and stereoscopic versions. In 2012 Fullmoon released the tenth installment titled Puppet <b>Master</b> X: <b>Axis</b> Rising which continued the story and events from the previous film. In 2017, Full Moon announced that Puppet Master: Axis Termination would debut exclusively on Full Moon Streaming in three parts starting in September 2017.|$|R
