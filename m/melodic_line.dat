5|$|Fauré's {{ambidexterity}} {{is reflected}} in the layout of many of his piano works, notably in the barcarolles, where the main <b>melodic</b> <b>line</b> is often in the middle register, with the accompaniments in the high treble part of the keyboard {{as well as in the}} bass. Duchen likens the effect of this in the barcarolles to that of a reflection shining up through the water.|$|E
5|$|The {{eleventh}} nocturne {{was written}} in memory of Noémi Lalo; her widower, Pierre Lalo, was a music critic and a friend and supporter of Fauré. Morrison suggests that its funereal effect of tolling bells may also reflect the composer's own state of anguish, with deafness encroaching. The <b>melodic</b> <b>line</b> is simple and restrained, and except for a passionate section near the end is generally quiet and elegiac.|$|E

Rossini uses the first four lines (out of eight). The <b>melodic</b> <b>line</b> of the soprano soloist begins with an upward broken seventh chord.|$|E

We base our {{work on the}} use of expectation maximization algorithm, which is employed in a two-step procedure that finds <b>melodic</b> <b>lines</b> in audio signals. In the first step, EM is used to find regions in the signal with strong and stable pitch (melodic fragments). In the second step, these fragments are grouped into clusters according to their properties (pitch, loudness [...] .). The obtained clusters represent distinct <b>melodic</b> <b>lines.</b> Gaussian Mixture Models, trained with EM are used for clustering.

5|$|The first barcarolle was {{dedicated}} to the pianist Caroline de Serres (Mme. Caroline Montigny-Rémaury) and premiered by Saint-Saëns at a concert of the Société Nationale de Musique in 1882. The piece begins with an uncomplicated melody in a traditional lilting Venetian style in 6/8 time. It develops into a more elaborate form before {{the introduction of the}} second theme, in which the <b>melodic</b> <b>line</b> is given in the middle register with delicate arpeggiated accompaniments in the treble and bass. Morrison comments that even in this early work, conventional sweetness is enlivened by subtle dissonance.|$|E
5|$|The <b>melodic</b> <b>line</b> of part B is {{contrasting}} in {{both its}} static {{character and the}} vehemence of the piano accompaniment, and by the double forte dynamics, as much by the double forte dynamics which give a brutal character, as {{by the use of}} sequences (E major to begin with, then B major, G major, E major, etc.). This section ends with a chromatic descent in the accompaniment at quadruple piano dynamic, up to a dominant seventh of G major, to prepare the return of the second section A in the original key.|$|E
5|$|The ninth nocturne, {{dedicated}} to Cortot's wife, Clotilde Bréal, {{is the first}} of three that share a directness and sparseness in contrast with the more elaborate structures and textures of their predecessors. The left-hand accompaniment to the <b>melodic</b> <b>line</b> is simple and generally unvaried, and the harmony looks forward to later composers of the 20th century, using a whole tone scale. Most of the piece is inward-looking and pensive, presaging the style of Fauré's final works, although it ends optimistically in a major key.|$|E

5|$|In Garden Rain (1974, for brass ensemble), {{the limited}} and pitch-specific {{harmonic}} vocabulary of the Japanese mouth organ, the shō (see ex. 3), and its specific timbres, are clearly emulated in Takemitsu's writing for brass instruments; even similarities of performance practice can be seen, (the players are often required to hold notes {{to the limit}} of their breath capacity). In A Flock Descends into the Pentagonal Garden, the characteristic timbres of the shō and its chords (several of which are simultaneous soundings of traditional Japanese pentatonic scales) are emulated in the opening held chords of the wind instruments (the first chord is in fact an exact transposition of the shō's chord, Jū (i); see ex. 3); meanwhile a solo oboe is assigned a <b>melodic</b> <b>line</b> that is similarly reminiscent of the lines played by the hichiriki in gagaku ensembles.|$|E
25|$|Also in the <b>melodic</b> <b>line</b> one {{can find}} {{characteristics}} similar to the morna (check main article — morna), for example the alternation between the main strophes and the refrain, the sweeping <b>melodic</b> <b>line,</b> the syncopation, etc. has changed it a little.|$|E

25|$|Compared to Landini's music, {{in which}} refinement, elegance, and a memorable <b>melodic</b> <b>line</b> were the clear {{goals of the}} composer, Andrea's music is dramatic, restless, and {{sometimes}} disjunct, and includes sharp dissonances to highlight certain passages in the text. One of his ballate includes a melodic leap of an augmented octave, highlighting the word maledetto (accursed), causing it to leap out {{from the rest of}} the music.|$|E
25|$|The <b>melodic</b> <b>line</b> of the morna varies a lot {{through the}} song, with {{ascending}} and descending note sequences, {{and within a}} bar the notes generally {{do not have the}} same length. One frequent characteristic of the morna is the syncopation, more precisely, one note at the end of a bar is extended to the strong beat of the next bar. The melody is accentuated on the first beat and the last half-beat of the bar.|$|E
25|$|Being a {{derivative}} of the morna, {{it is natural}} that the coladeira shares some characteristics with the former, as the harmonic sequence, the verse structure and a varied and syncopated <b>melodic</b> <b>line.</b> According to J. Monteiro, the true coladeira {{is the one that}} results from a morna. So, if the morna is normally played with a 60 bpm tempo, the coladeira should have a 120 bpm tempo. However, this is not always the case.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{presented}} study {{deals with}} extraction of <b>melodic</b> <b>line(s)</b> from polyphonic audio recordings. Our approach {{is based on}} finding significant melodic fragments throughout the analyzed piece of music and clustering these fragments according to their timbral similarity. Fragments within clusters are taken to represent fragments belonging to different <b>melodic</b> <b>lines.</b> Holes between significant fragments within each cluster are filled-in by a shortest-path approach over all melodic fragments. The paper presents our study in more detail and provides results on real recordings...|$|R

25|$|Most of {{his music}} is in the most {{advanced}} style of the time. His four-part vocal music usually has a highly ornamented and expressive melodic line; the differentiation of the <b>melodic</b> <b>line</b> from the others {{is one of the}} defining features of the early Baroque. Sometimes he experimented with the Enharmonic scale, or enharmonic chromaticism which required microtonal tunings; apparently he built a special pipe organ in the 1590s for playing this kind of music.|$|E
25|$|That {{is due to}} the {{presence}} of two opposite styles in the '50s of this variant of the coladeira, that correspond to the preference of certain composers: the “Ti Goy style” has a slower tempo (moderato), a simpler <b>melodic</b> <b>line,</b> the traditional 3 chords series, the use of rhymes and a more sarcastic thematic; the “Tony Marques style” has a quicker tempo (allegro), a melody well adapted to the rhythmics, a richer chord progression with passing chords, and a more varied thematic.|$|E
25|$|Offertories are sung {{during the}} {{offering}} of Eucharistic bread and wine. Offertories once had highly prolix melodies in their verses, but {{the use of}} verses in Gregorian Offertories disappeared around the 12th century. These verses however, are among the most ornate and elaborated in the whole chant repertoire. Offertories are in form closest to Responsories, which are likewise accompanied by at least one Verse and the opening sections of both Off. and Resp. are partly repeated after the verse(s). This last section is therefore called the 'repetenda' and is in performance the last <b>melodic</b> <b>line</b> of the chant.|$|E

25|$|Although Pullen {{was able}} {{to play the piano}} in almost any style, the {{attribute}} that had made his contributions so important to the wide-ranging music of Mingus was his ability to place extremely precise singing runs or glissandi over heavy chords, reminiscent of traditional blues, while never losing contact with the <b>melodic</b> <b>line.</b> His technique for creating these runs, where he seemed to roll his right hand over and over along the keys, received much comment from critics, was studied by pianists, and heavily filmed and investigated, but could never be totally explained, even by Pullen, who had developed it. His piano technique can be seen on the DVDs Mingus At Montreux 1975 and Roots Salutes The Saxophones.|$|E
25|$|The {{music of}} the Romantic era, from roughly {{the first decade of}} the 19th century to the early 20th century, was {{characterized}} by increased attention to an extended <b>melodic</b> <b>line,</b> as well as expressive and emotional elements, paralleling romanticism in other art forms. Musical forms began to break from the Classical era forms (even as those were being codified), with free-form pieces like nocturnes, fantasias, and preludes being written where accepted ideas about the exposition and development of themes were ignored or minimized. The music became more chromatic, dissonant, and tonally colorful, with tensions (with respect to accepted norms of the older forms) about key signatures increasing. The art song (or Lied) came to maturity in this era, as did the epic scales of grand opera, ultimately transcended by Richard Wagner's Ring cycle.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the Ordo Virtutum, Hildegard composed many liturgical songs that were collected into a cycle called the Symphonia armoniae celestium revelationum. The songs from the Symphonia are set to Hildegard's own text and range from antiphons, hymns, and sequences, to responsories. Her music is described as monophonic, that is, consisting of exactly one <b>melodic</b> <b>line.</b> Its style is characterized by soaring melodies that can push {{the boundaries of the}} more staid ranges of traditional Gregorian chant. Though Hildegard's music is often thought to stand outside the normal practices of monophonic monastic chant, current researchers are also exploring ways in which it may be viewed in comparison with her contemporaries, such as Hermannus Contractus. Another feature of Hildegard's music that both reflects twelfth-century evolutions of chant and pushes those evolutions further is that it is highly melismatic, often with recurrent melodic units. Scholars such as Margot Fassler, Marianne Richert Pfau, and Beverly Lomer also note the intimate relationship between music and text in Hildegard's compositions, whose rhetorical features are often more distinct than is common in twelfth-century chant. As with all medieval chant notation, Hildegard's music lacks any indication of tempo or rhythm; the surviving manuscripts employ late German style notation, which uses very ornamental neumes. The reverence for the Virgin Mary reflected in music shows how deeply influenced and inspired Hildegard of Bingen and her community were by the Virgin Mary and the saints.|$|E
50|$|Vocal {{polyphony}} {{based on}} ostinato formulas and rhythmic drone are widely distributed in all Georgian regional styles. Apart from these common techniques, {{there are also}} other, more complex forms of polyphony: pedal drone polyphony in Eastern Georgia, particularly in Kartli and Kakheti table songs (two highly embellished <b>melodic</b> <b>lines</b> develop rhythmically free on the background of pedal drone), and contrapuntal polyphony in Achara, Imereti, Samegrelo, and particularly in Guria (three and four part polyphony with highly individualized <b>melodic</b> <b>lines</b> in each part {{and the use of}} several polyphonic techniques). Western Georgian contrapuntal polyphony features the local variety of the yodel, known as krimanchuli.|$|R
