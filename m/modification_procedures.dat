In this study, two {{surface roughness}} <b>modification</b> <b>procedures</b> were proposed for Ti 6 Al 4 V scaffolds {{in order to achieve}} this aim: chemical etching followed by electrochemical polishing. This study dealt with the in depth characterization of the effect of the surface roughness modification on the morphological and mechanical properties of the porous Ti 6 Al 4 V scaffolds and on their roughness.

Increased precision at the lower levels represents an important validity issue regarding the use of NAEP as a means of benchmarking and interpreting change in national and state performance over time. The purpose of the current study was to design and field test an accessible block alternative for the grade 4 and grade 8 NAEP math assessments. The study was conducted in two phases. The first phase of the study focused on the development of a set of Item Modification Guidelines and Item <b>Modification</b> <b>Procedures,</b> and concluded with a small pilot (n = 671 per block).
