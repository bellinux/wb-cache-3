Dogs are visually examined by veterinarians stationed at every checkpoint, and mushers can be ejected and banned from the race for mistreating dogs. Dog whips and forced feeding are forbidden. Participating dogs <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>receive</b> injections during the race or be {{under the influence of}} performance-enhancing substances such as steroids. The race marshal may remove any team from the race for violations of these rules or substandard dog care.|$|E
5|$|Each planet {{offers a}} {{possible}} quest or {{challenge to the}} player. Challenges are tactical battles in which the player must fight against a variety of enemies. However, ships can only be harmed from behind or below; attacks from any other position will be countered by the ships' shields. Upon succeeding, a new chapter {{is added to the}} player's character's story, and the player is rewarded with ship upgrades. These upgrades are used to customize ships with improvements, such as increased firing speed or heavier rear armor. The upgrades available to the player upon finishing each encounter with an enemy can vary, so the player <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>receive</b> the same upgrade by playing the same encounter in two different adventures. Flotilla has cooperative and split-screen multiplayer modes that can be played with an additional Xbox 360 controller.|$|E

25|$|Patients with variant {{forms of}} the gene CYP2D6 (also called simply 2D6) <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>receive</b> full benefit from {{tamoxifen}} because of too slow metabolism of the tamoxifen prodrug into its active metabolites.

DNA Drug Safety Testing can examine DNA variations in the CYP2D6 and other important drug processing pathways. More than 20% of all clinically used medications are metabolized by CYP2D6 and knowing the CYP2D6 status of a person can help the doctor with the future selection of medications. Other molecular biomarkers may also be used to select appropriate patients likely to benefit from tamoxifen.|$|E

25|$|Alongside to cartels, are the {{paramilitary}} groups who work alongside {{them to provide}} protection. This protection began {{with a focus on}} maintaining the drug trade; however, paramilitary groups now secure other valuable industries such as oil and mining. It has been suggested that the rise in paramilitary groups coincides with a loss of security within the government. These paramilitary groups came about in a number of ways. Firstly, there have been large waves of elite armed forces and government security experts who have left the side of the government and joined the side of the cartels, often with large bribes and an opportunity for types of wealth they <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>receive</b> in government positions. The paramilitary group, the Zetas, used military personnel to create one of the largest paramilitary groups in Mexico. Some of the elite armed forces members who join paramilitaries are trained in the School of the Americas. These paramilitaries have begun out of a deregulation of the Mexican army who has been slowly replaced by private security firms.|$|E
500|$|The gas giant planet [...] "b" [...] {{is located}} in the liquid water {{habitable}} zone of Mu Arae. This would prevent an Earth-like planet from forming in the habitable zone, however large moons of the gas giant could potentially support liquid water. On the other hand, it is unclear whether such massive moons could actually form around a gas giant planet, thanks to an apparent scaling law between the mass of the planet and its satellite system. In addition, measurements of the star's ultraviolet flux suggest that any potentially habitable planets or moons <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>receive</b> enough ultraviolet to trigger the formation of biomolecules. [...] Planet [...] "d" [...] would receive a similar amount of ultraviolet to the Earth and thus lies in the ultraviolet habitable zone, however, it would be too hot for any moons to support surface liquid water.|$|E

500|$|In 1983, the Church {{issued a}} new code of canon law. Unlike its predecessor, the 1983 Code of Canon Law did not {{explicitly}} name Masonic orders among the secret societies it condemns. It states: [...] "A person who joins an association which plots against the Church {{is to be}} punished with a just penalty; one who promotes or takes office in such an association is to be punished with an interdict." [...] This named omission of Masonic orders caused both Catholics and Freemasons {{to believe that the}} ban on Catholics becoming Freemasons may have been lifted, especially after the perceived liberalisation of Vatican II. However, the matter was clarified when Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI), as the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, issued a Declaration on Masonic Associations, which states: [...] "...the Church's negative judgment in regard to Masonic association remains unchanged since their principles have always been considered irreconcilable with the doctrine of the Church and therefore membership in them remains forbidden. The faithful who enrol in Masonic associations {{are in a state of}} grave sin and <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>receive</b> Holy Communion." [...] For its part, Freemasonry has never objected to Catholics joining their fraternity. Those Grand Lodges in amity with UGLE deny the Church's claims. The UGLE now states that [...] "Freemasonry does not seek to replace a Mason's religion or provide a substitute for it." ...|$|E

[...] A woman <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>receive</b> letters of friendship addressed to her only and not to her husband as well."

In order to encourage use of 000, mobile telephones imported commercially into Australia are required to be programmed to treat 000 in the same fashion as 112 (i.e. dialling with key lock enabled, use of any carrier, preferential routing, etc.).
