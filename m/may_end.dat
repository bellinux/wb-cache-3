5|$|In about 65 billion years, it {{estimated}} that the Moon <b>may</b> <b>end</b> up colliding with the Earth, assuming they are not destroyed by the red giant Sun, due to the remaining energy of the Earth–Moon system being sapped by the remnant Sun, causing the Moon to slowly move inwards toward the Earth.|$|E
5|$|Jaco Van Dormael {{was born}} in Ixelles. Belgium, on 9 February 1957 to a Belgian couple. Van Dormael was raised in Germany until age seven, when his family {{returned}} to Belgium. At his birth, he had nearly been strangled by the umbilical cord and received an insufficient supply of oxygen. It was feared that he <b>may</b> <b>end</b> up mentally impaired. This trauma accounts for the recurring themes in his films, which explore the worlds of people with mental and physical disabilities.|$|E
5|$|Russell {{argues that}} naked power arises within a {{government}} under certain social conditions: when {{two or more}} fanatical creeds are contending for governance, and when all traditional beliefs have decayed. A period of naked power <b>may</b> <b>end</b> by foreign conquest, the creation of stability, and/or {{the rise of a}} new religion (Russell 1938:74).|$|E

5|$|The {{contractor}} {{stated that}} they will continue without the additional requested money if FDOT denies it, but it <b>may</b> <b>end</b> up as a court case as the contractor seeks it later. On July 19, the FDOT denied the request for more money to the contractor, stating that the geological issue cited was not as extensive as MAT claimed.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{sideline}} 4...g5, {{the main line}} continues with both players developing their pieces around the e5-pawn with 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ when White has an important choice between the moves 6.Nc3 and 6.Nbd2, each leading to extremely different play. With 6.Nc3 White acquiesces to the breakup of his queenside pawns {{in return for a}} material advantage of one pawn, the bishop pair and active play in the centre. With 6.Nbd2 White gives back the gambited pawn to keep a healthy pawn structure and acquire the bishop pair. After 6.Nbd2Qe7 White generally plays 7.a3 to force the immediate exchange of bishop for knight, gaining the bishop pair, a spatial advantage and chances for a minority attack on the queenside. White can also try 6.Nbd2Qe7 7.e3 to win a tempo over the 7.a3 variation, though he <b>may</b> <b>end</b> up with the exchange at d2 made in less favourable circumstances, or not at all. The maverick gambit 6...f6 also exists.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the play, {{the actors}} file out slowly (most {{important}} first, with gaps between actors), and while they are on the bridge (hashigakari), the audience claps restrainedly. Between actors, clapping ceases, then begins again as the next actor leaves. Unlike in western theatre, there is no bowing, nor do the actors return to the stage after having left. A play <b>may</b> <b>end</b> with the shite character leaving the stage as part of the story (as in Kokaji, for instance)—rather than ending with all characters on stage—in which case one claps as the character exits.|$|E

5|$|Detective Mike Banner invites Chris for an {{interview}} {{in relation to the}} murder. Beforehand, Chris throws Mrs. Eastby's jewelry and drugs into the river, but by chance her ring bounces on the railing and falls to the pavement. At the police station, Chris lies about his relationship with Nola, but Banner surprises him with her diary, in which he is featured extensively. He confesses his affair but denies any link to the murder, and appeals to the detectives not to involve him further in their investigation as news of the affair <b>may</b> <b>end</b> his marriage just as he and his wife are expecting a baby.|$|E
5|$|Guitar Hero: Aerosmiths {{gameplay}} {{is structured}} similarly to the gameplay {{of the other}} games in the series, in which players use a guitar-shaped peripheral to simulate the playing of rock music, hitting fret buttons and strumming in time to notes as they scroll on the screen. The player's performance is tracked through each song; if the player does well they are given a score and a rating of up to five stars; if the player performs poorly, the song <b>may</b> <b>end</b> prematurely and the player will need to try the song again. Each song can be played at one of four difficulties that changes the number and speed of the notes that must be played.|$|E
5|$|Independent twin sets or {{independent}} doubles {{consists of two}} independent cylinders and two regulators, each with a submersible pressure gauge. This system is heavier, more expensive to buy and maintain and more expensive to fill than a single cylinder set. The diver must swap demand valves during the dive to preserve a sufficient reserve of gas in each cylinder. If this is not done, then if a cylinder should fail the diver <b>may</b> <b>end</b> up having an inadequate reserve. Independent twin sets do not work well with air-integrated computers as they usually only monitor one cylinder. The complexity of switching regulators periodically to ensure both cylinders are evenly used may be offset by the redundancy of two entirely separate breathing gas supplies. The cylinders may be mounted as a twin set on the diver's back, or alternatively can be carried in a sidemount configuration where penetration of wrecks or caves requires it, and where the cylinder valves are in easy reach.|$|E

5|$|Joe Bangs {{finds himself}} unable {{to have the}} case dropped, but Bletcher still feels that Black's pursuit of it <b>may</b> <b>end</b> up costing her her job. However, Black knows she is {{doing the right thing}} and is {{determined}} to continue. Her fears for Sara are confirmed when it is discovered she and the elder Bangs have gone missing. Frank, an offender profiler, deduces that Bangs' controlling personality would cause him to take his daughter somewhere he knows, and realizes that they will be in the family's holiday cabin in the woods. A police manhunt begins, and Bangs is arrested without Sara coming to harm.|$|E
5|$|Kirk {{moves out}} of the Van Houten house and manages to keep a cheery {{attitude}} until he is fired from {{his job at the}} cracker factory. Luann quickly readjusts to single life with Milhouse and starts a new relationship with an American Gladiator. While at Moe's, Kirk mentions that he never saw the divorce coming and regrets not being more sensitive to Luann's needs. Homer cheers Kirk up by telling him that his marriage to Marge is solid, but Homer soon begins to fear that his marriage <b>may</b> <b>end</b> in divorce. Homer enlists the aid of Lisa to help him figure out how to save his marriage, but Lisa tells Homer that he is lucky to have Marge. He recalls his wedding reception, which was nothing more than Homer and Marge eating a whale cake at a roadside truck stop. Homer tries to perform selfless gestures for Marge, but they only serve to annoy her.|$|E
5|$|One way {{to advance}} {{emergency}} medical care is to obtain the recognition of emergency medicine as a specialty in countries that currently lack it. Without such recognition, {{it is difficult to}} set up training programs or recruit potential students, as they face the uncertainly of training to obtain a credential that <b>may</b> <b>end</b> up being useless to them. Recognition increases the visibility and prestige of the profession and promotes other efforts to advance its development. Botswana may serve as a case study. Its recent recognition of emergency medicine as a specialty has been closely accompanied by the creation of the Botswana Society for Emergency Care, the establishment of a Resuscitation Training Centre and a Trauma Research Centre at the University of Botswana, and the formation of a committee to design a national policy for pre-hospital care.|$|E

5|$|Reproduction is {{by either}} asexual or sexual means. Parts of the coral may get {{detached}} from the colony by a storm or other means, {{and some of these}} fragments <b>may</b> <b>end</b> up in suitable locations to grow into new colonies which will be genetically identical to the parent colony. This fragmentation is probably the most frequent method of reproduction. Alternatively, certain pores called ampullae contain polyps that bud off short-lived, jellyfish-like medusae, which separate from the colony. They produce gametes which, after fertilisation, develop into planula larvae. These drift with the currents as part of the zooplankton before settling out and developing into new colonies.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth of}} the inner core may be {{expected}} to consume most of the outer core by some 3–4 billion years from now, resulting in a nearly solid core composed of iron and other heavy elements. The surviving liquid envelope will mainly consist of lighter elements that will undergo less mixing. Alternatively, if at some point plate tectonics comes to an end, the interior will cool less efficiently, which <b>may</b> <b>end</b> the {{growth of the}} inner core. In either case, this can result in the loss of the magnetic dynamo. Without a functioning dynamo, the magnetic field of the Earth will decay in a geologically short time period of roughly 10,000 years. The loss of the magnetosphere will cause an increase in erosion of light elements, particularly hydrogen, from the Earth's outer atmosphere into space, resulting in less favorable conditions for life.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{possible}} elements is not known. A very early suggestion made by Elliot Adams in 1911, {{and based on the}} arrangement of elements in each horizontal periodic table row, was that elements of atomic weight greater than 256± (which would equate to between elements 99 and 100 in modern-day terms) did not exist. A higher—more recent—estimate is that the periodic table <b>may</b> <b>end</b> soon after the island of stability, which is expected to centre around element 126, as the extension of the periodic and nuclides tables is restricted by proton and neutron drip lines. Other predictions of an end to the periodic table include at element 128 by John Emsley, at element 137 by Richard Feynman, and at element 155 by Albert Khazan.|$|E

5|$|Both {{independent}} and dependent colony foundation can occur after mating. Isolation by distance (IBD) patterns {{have been recorded}} with M. pilosula queens, where nests that tend to be closer together were more genetically {{related to each other}} in comparison to other nests further away. Independent colony foundation is closely associated with queens which engage in nuptial flight in areas far from their home colony, showing that dependent colony foundation mostly occurs if they mate near their nest. In some cases, queens could seek adoption into alien colonies if there are no suitable areas to find a nest or independent colony foundation cannot be carried out. Other queens could try and return to their home nest after nuptial flight, but they <b>may</b> <b>end</b> up in another nest near the nest they originally came from. In multiple-queen societies, the egg-laying queens are generally unrelated to one another, but one study showed that it is possible for multiple queens in the same colony to be genetically related to each other. Depending on the species, the number of individuals present in a colony can range from 50 to over 2,200 individuals. A colony with less than 100 workers is not considered a mature colony. M. dispar colonies have around 15 to 329 ants, M. nigrocincta have over 1,000, M. pyriformis have from 200 to over 1,400 and M. gulosa have nearly 1,600. A colony can last for a number of years. Foraging behaviour among smaller workers which never usually leave the nest can be a sign of a colony's impending demise.|$|E
5|$|Both leagues {{employ the}} same two-series playoff format, {{with the top}} three teams from each league {{participating}} in their own two-stage playoff. If two teams vying for a third Climax Series spot finish the regular season with identical records, the team that finished the previous season with a better record is allowed {{to advance to the}} playoffs, unless if both teams finished with the same previous season record. The First Stage is a best-of-three series involving the regular season's second- and third-place finishers, with all games played at the second-place team's home field. The winner of this series goes on to face the league's pennant-winner in the Final Stage. This series is best-of-six. The league champion is awarded a one-win advantage as well as home field advantage for the entire series, unlike most professional leagues where a 5-game playoff series runs 2-2-1 or 2-3 or a 7-game playoff series that runs 2-3-2 with the higher seed receiving the extra game. The winning teams advance to the Japan Series, where they compete against one another. Unlike MLB, NPB games <b>may</b> <b>end</b> in a tie if there is no winner after 12innings of play. If a Climax Series game results in a tie, the win is credited to neither team. If this causes the series to end in a tie, the team who finished higher in the regular-season standings advances, unless if both teams finished with the same regular-season record. If both teams finished with the same regular season record, the team who won the most matches against the other team will advance.|$|E
5|$|Isolated lower premolars {{are known}} from I.kamlialensis. A p3, YGSP 33157, {{resembles that of}} YGSP 32727 in {{possessing}} a single large cusp connected to crests at the front and back. A heel is present at the back, part of a small talonid. The tooth has two roots. The p4, represented by YGSP 24338, is an elongate, two-rooted tooth with a distinct trigonid at the front and talonid at the back. The protoconid is the highest cusp of the trigonid. Two crests descend from it at right angles in a lingual direction (towards the inner side of the tooth): the protolophid towards the front, ending at the low paraconid, and the metalophid towards the back, reaching the elongate metaconid. The talonid basin is open lingually; on the labial side, the hypoconid cusp is present. A crest, the cristid obliqua, reaches from the hypoconid forward towards the trigonid. No other cusps are visible in the talonid, but the specimen is worn and poorly preserved; the posterolophid, a crest descending from the hypoconid, <b>may</b> <b>end</b> in a small hypoconulid. A weak cingulum is present on the labial side of the tooth between the protoconid and hypoconid. Another tooth, YGSP 32151, is interpreted as a dp4. It has a more closed trigonid (with the protolophid and metalophid making a more acute angle), the protolophid is shorter, and the paraconid is indistinct. In the talonid, the hypoconulid and entoconid are distinct. The labial cingulum is strong.|$|E
