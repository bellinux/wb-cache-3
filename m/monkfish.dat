5|$|The Pacific {{angelshark}} {{was first}} scientifically described in 1859 by William Orville Ayres, the first Curator of Ichthyology at the California Academy of Sciences. He {{gave it the}} specific epithet californica, as the originally-described specimen was caught off San Francisco. Locally, this species may also {{be referred to as}} angel shark, California angel shark, or <b>monkfish.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bouillabaisse is a {{substantial}} dish from the French port of Marseille, capital of Provence. It is a stew for at least eight people, because it should contain many kinds of fish such as crayfish, gurnard, weever, John Dory, <b>monkfish,</b> conger eel, whiting, sea bass, and crab. These are cooked with Mediterranean vegetables and herbs, namely onions, garlic, tomatoes, thyme, fennel, parsley, bay, and orange peel.|$|E
5|$|Marine life inhabiting {{the waters}} around Lōʻihi {{is not as}} diverse as life at other, less active seamounts. Fish found living near Lōʻihi include the Celebes <b>monkfish</b> (Sladenia remiger), {{and members of the}} Cutthroat eel family, Synaphobranchidae. Invertebrates {{identified}} in the area include two species endemic to the hydrothermal vents, a bresiliid shrimp (Opaepele loihi) of the family Alvinocarididae (described in 1995), and a tube or pogonophoran worm. Dives conducted after the 1996 earthquake swarms were unable to find either the shrimp or the worm, and it is not known if there are lasting effects on these species.|$|E
5|$|The menu uses {{locally grown}} produce from Powys and Shropshire, {{and is a}} {{combination}} of classic and modern French cuisine with seasonal changes. Dishes include a pork belly main from the nearby Neuadd Fach baconry, which is served with an apple mousseline, pear and au jus. A <b>monkfish</b> main course comes served with a langoustine consommé and a Brussels sprout purée. Other French courses include a French onion soup and a cheese soufflé. Desserts served include a nougat tube filled with white chocolate and passion fruit mousse, and a trio of lemon pots.|$|E
5|$|The {{black dogfish}} is {{harmless}} to humans and of little commercial value. Substantial numbers are caught incidentally by commercial deep-sea trawl, gillnet, and longline fisheries operating throughout the North Atlantic, including the Icelandic Greenland halibut fishery, the French mixed-species trawl fishery, and the Canadian Greenland halibut, crab, redfish, <b>monkfish,</b> and witch fisheries. Captured sharks are usually discarded, though {{in recent years}} this and other small deepwater sharks have been increasingly retained and used for fishmeal. Reported catches by European countries, of which France made the largest contribution, have followed a declining trend from 486 tons in 2001 to 35 tons in 2006. The average catch by Canadian fisheries was 68 tons per year from 1996 to 2005. The black dogfish occurs mostly too deep for fisheries off southern Africa; {{in the remainder of}} its range, little information is available on fishery impact.|$|E
5|$|The {{coastline}} supplies many crustaceans, sea bass, <b>monkfish</b> and herring. Normandy has {{top quality}} seafood, such as scallops and sole, while Brittany has {{a supply of}} lobster, crayfish and mussels. Normandy {{is home to a}} large population of apple trees; apples are often used in dishes, as well as cider and Calvados. The northern areas of this region, especially Nord, grow ample amounts of wheat, sugar beets and chicory. Thick stews are found often in these northern areas as well. The produce of these northern regions is also considered some {{of the best in the}} country, including cauliflower and artichokes. Buckwheat grows widely in Brittany as well and is used in the region's galettes, called jalet, which is where this dish originated.|$|E
25|$|Other {{examples}} of coastal demersal fish are cod, plaice, <b>monkfish</b> and sole.|$|E
25|$|One family, the Lophiidae, is of {{commercial}} interest with fisheries found in north-western Europe, eastern North America, Africa, and East Asia. In Europe and North America, the tail meat of fish {{of the genus}} Lophius, known as <b>monkfish</b> or goosefish (North America), is widely used in cooking, and is often compared to lobster tail in taste and texture. In Asia, especially Korea and Japan, <b>monkfish</b> liver, known as ankimo, is considered a delicacy.|$|E
25|$|Seafood Watch {{have placed}} {{on their list}} of seafood that sustainability-minded {{consumers}} should avoid the following demersal fish: sturgeon (imported wild), Chilean seabass, cod (Atlantic, imported Pacific), flounder (Atlantic), halibut (Atlantic), sole (Atlantic), grouper, <b>monkfish,</b> orange roughy, demersal shark, red snapper and tilapia (Asia farmed).|$|E
25|$|Much {{maritime}} activity {{takes place}} - especially at Kilmore Quay and Slade, {{but also on}} a smaller scale at many other locations. Common fish species include herring, mackerel, cod, <b>monkfish,</b> whiting, bass, perch, gurnard, haddock, mullet, pollock, John Dory, sole, conger eel, shad, salmon, trout, pike, carp, and tench. Shellfish include mussels, cockles, periwinkles, clams, and oysters.|$|E
25|$|The Scandinavian {{fisherman}} {{founded the}} Independent Dock, {{which is now}} known as Viking Village and, today, provides a combined shopping and industrial establishment with both handcrafted goods and fresh seafood. Catches typically consist of scallops, tuna, swordfish, tilefish, weakfish, <b>monkfish,</b> bluefish, shad, dogfish, and various other types of in-shore fish. In the 1960s and 1970s, foreign trawlers were permitted to fish in the area. Nearly all of the cod to have been fished out of the area. The scallop boat Lindsay L, docked at Viking Village, was used in the movie The Perfect Storm.|$|E
25|$|Several {{adaptations to}} piscivory evolved with some groups having crocodile-like skulls with slender snouts, and presumably {{had a similar}} life-style (Archegosauridae, Melosauridae, Cochleosauridae and Eryopidae, and the reptile-like {{suborder}} Embolomeri). Others, evolved as aquatic ambush predators, with short, broad skulls that allowed for opening the mouth by tipping the skull back rather than dropping the jaw (Plagiosauridae and the dvinosaur families). In life they would have hunted rather like the modern day <b>monkfish,</b> and several groups {{are known to have}} retained the larval gills into adulthood, being fully aquatic. The Metoposauridae adapted to hunting in shallows and murky swamps, with ∩-shaped skull, much like their Devonian ancestors.|$|E
25|$|White wine is {{also used}} as a wetting agent for slow cooking. In this type of dish it {{combines}} {{the flexibility of the}} meat and balances the fat from the sauce. It plays this role in the case of cabbage, baeckeoffe or risotto, and in the gravy in the preparation of white meat as in osso buco or Blanquette de veau (veal stew), Chicken with morels and its variants, Chicken à la comtoise and Yellow Coq au vin, rabbit or with charcuterie such as Diots and tripe. It {{can also be used to}} prepare fish and seafood dishes such as pôchouse with Burgundy wine, <b>monkfish</b> stew, Flounder stew, mussels in white wine, or a Seafood Pot-au-feu.|$|E
500|$|A popular feature at the Pike Place Fish Market is the <b>monkfish,</b> which sometimes, {{thanks to}} a hidden line, is made to [...] "snap" [...] at customers. In 1991, CNN named the Pike Place Fish Market {{as one of the}} three most fun places to work in America.|$|E
500|$|From 1982 to 1992, {{researchers}} in Hawaiʻi Undersea Research Laboratory submersibles photographed the fish of Lōʻihi Seamount, Johnston Atoll, and Cross Seamount at depths between [...] and [...] A {{small number of}} species identified at Lōʻihi were newly recorded sightings in Hawaiʻi, including the Tassled coffinfish (Chaunax fimbriatus), and the Celebes <b>monkfish.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Japanese {{angelshark}} {{was described}} by Dutch ichthyologist Pieter Bleeker in an 1858 volume of the scientific journal Acta Societatis Scientiarum Indo-Neerlandicae. The type specimen is a male [...] long, collected off Nagasaki, Japan, hence the specific epithet japonica. Other common names for this species include change angel shark, change canopy shark, Japanese angelfish, and Japanese <b>monkfish.</b>|$|E
500|$|Matthew Norman {{gave the}} {{restaurant}} {{three and a}} half stars out of five, following a visit in early 2014 for The Daily Telegraph. He praised the soufflé and the French onion soup, but called the <b>monkfish</b> [...] "bland". The pork belly dish was described by his colleague as [...] "superb, just the right side of too intimately piggy". Norman concluded that the restaurant was a [...] "slick operation", but the [...] "character, vibrancy and fun had been slaughtered on the altar of satisfying the inspectorate".|$|E
500|$|Squatina squatina, the {{angelshark}} or <b>monkfish,</b> is {{a species}} of shark in the family Squatinidae (known generally also as angel sharks), that were once widespread in the coastal waters of the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. Well-adapted for camouflaging itself on the sea floor, the angelshark has a flattened form with enlarged pectoral and pelvic fins, giving it a superficial resemblance to a ray. This species can be identified by its broad and stout body, conical barbels, thornless back (in larger individuals), and grayish or brownish dorsal coloration with a pattern of numerous small light and dark markings (that is more vivid in juveniles). It measures up to [...] long.|$|E
500|$|Fishing remains {{central to}} the islands' economy today, with the total catch being [...] in 2009, valued at over £73.2 million. Mackerel makes up {{more than half of}} the catch in Shetland by weight and value, and there are {{significant}} landings of haddock, cod, herring, whiting, <b>monkfish</b> and shellfish. Farming is mostly concerned with the raising of Shetland sheep, known for their unusually fine wool. Crops raised include oats and barley; however, the cold, windswept islands make for a harsh environment for most plants. Crofting, the farming of small plots of land on a legally restricted tenancy basis, is still practised and is viewed as a key Shetland tradition as well as an important source of income.|$|E
500|$|The {{angelshark}} {{was originally}} {{described by the}} Swedish natural historian Carl Linnaeus, known as the [...] "father of taxonomy", in the 1758 tenth edition of Systema Naturae as Squalus squatina. He did not designate a type specimen. The word squatina is the angelshark's name in Latin, derived from the word for skate; it was made the genus name for all angel sharks by the French zoologist André Duméril in 1806. Other common names used for this species include angel, angel fiddle fish, angel puffy fish, angel ray, angelfish, escat jueu, fiddle fish, monk, and <b>monkfish.</b> Stelbrink and colleagues (2010) conducted a phylogenetic study based on mitochondrial DNA, {{and found that the}} sister species of the angelshark is the sawback angelshark (S. aculeata). The two species formed a clade with a number of Asian angelshark species.|$|E
500|$|In September 1996, Ben Rogers ate at the {{restaurant}} for The Independent before it had gained any Michelin stars or the awards it has today and {{while it was still}} using something close to its original menu. Even so, he discovered that Blumenthal was cooking foie gras in sherry in order to give it a nutty flavour, although Rogers wasn't sure if the nutty flavour was warranted in the dish itself. He did think that a jambonneau of duck was worth praising, describing it as [...] "delicious", but also thought that another dish of <b>monkfish</b> was rubbery in texture. He described the menu itself as [...] "awkwardly written, badly punctuated, and at points quite impenetrable". Following the first Michelin star, David Fingleton visited {{the restaurant}} for The Spectator, and said that the experience was [...] "beyond reproach; unsullied pleasure from start to finish".|$|E
500|$|Among {{the recipes}} in Soups, Salads and Sides are [...] "Egg Chowder with Bacon and New Potatoes", [...] "Grilled Bacon and Cucumber Salad with Chili Caramel Dressing", and [...] "Spicy Braised Bacon with Spagna Beans and Treviso Radicchio" [...] which uses thickly sliced pork belly bacon. The Pasta section has {{a recipe for}} [...] "Bacon Mac and Cheese" [...] from Julie Taras Wallach, the chef and {{co-owner}} of the Tipsy Parson and Little Giant restaurants in New York City. Her variant on the traditional macaroni and cheese uses cavatelli pasta seasoned with dijon mustard, thyme, rosemary, garlic, and nutmeg and incorporates sauteed onion and pieces of grilled bacon. One of the recipes in the Meat section, [...] "Veal and Foie Gras Meatloaf Wrapped in Bacon", comes from Mark Allen, who in 1997 became the youngest chef, and the first American, to have headed The Dining Room at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston. Allen also contributed a recipe for the Fish section, [...] "Whole Roasted Branzino with Carrots and Bacon". Other dishes in that section include [...] "Pancetta-Wrapped <b>Monkfish</b> with Cauliflower Flan" [...] and [...] "Bluefish with Corn, Avocado, and Bacon Salad".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, some punk funk bands such as Out Hud and Mongolian <b>MonkFish</b> {{perform in the}} indie rock scene. Indie band Rilo Kiley, in keeping with their {{tendency}} to explore a variety of rockish styles, incorporated funk into their song [...] "The Moneymaker" [...] on the album Under the Blacklight. Prince, with his later albums, gave a rebirth to the funk sound with songs like [...] "The Everlasting Now", [...] "Musicology", [...] "Ol' Skool Company", and [...] "Black Sweat".|$|E
2500|$|Sole, {{along with}} the other major bottom-feeding fish in the North Sea such as cod, <b>monkfish,</b> and plaice, is listed by the ICES as [...] "outside safe {{biological}} limits." [...] Moreover, they are growing less quickly now and are rarely older than six years, although they can reach forty. World stocks of large predatory fish and large ground fish such as sole and flounder were estimated in 2003 to be only about 10% of pre-industrial levels. According to the World Wildlife Fund in 2006, [...] "of the nine sole stocks, seven are overfished with the status of the remaining two unknown." [...] Data is insufficient to assess the remaining stocks; however, landings for all stocks are at or near historical lows." ...|$|E
2500|$|Like other skates, {{the common}} skate is a bottom feeder. Its diet {{consists}} of crustaceans, clams, oysters, snails, bristle worms, cephalopods, and small to medium-sized fish (such as sand eel, flatfish, <b>monkfish,</b> catsharks, spurdog, other skates). The {{size of the}} individual can affect its diet. Larger ones eat larger things like fish. The bigger the skate is the more food that {{will be needed to}} sustain its large body size. The activity level determines how much it eats; the more active it is the more it eats. [...] The common skate does not only feed on creatures {{at the bottom of the}} ocean, as some do ascend to feed on mackerel, herring, and other pelagic fish, which are caught by rapidly moving up from the seabed to grab the prey.|$|E
50|$|Concern is {{expressed}} over {{the sustainability of}} <b>monkfish</b> fishing. The method most commonly used to catch <b>monkfish,</b> beam trawling, {{has been described as}} damaging to seafloor habitats. In February 2007, the British supermarket chain Asda banned <b>monkfish</b> from their stores.|$|E
50|$|<b>Monkfish,</b> {{like most}} anglerfish, are also characterised by an {{enormously}} distensible stomach, which allows an individual <b>monkfish</b> to swallow prey fully {{as large as}} itself. <b>Monkfish</b> grow to a length of more than 150 cm; specimens of 100 cm are common.|$|E
