500|$|... "Rockstar 101" [...] is a grunge-crunk and hip hop song which {{lasts for}} three minutes and fifty-eight seconds. It {{features}} an [...] "aggressive" [...] guitar solo from Slash, according to Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly. Rihanna uses her lower register and [...] "heavy" [...] modulation to perform {{the most of the}} song, and she [...] "growls" [...] the lyric [...] "The only thing I'm missing is a black guitar". Rihanna [...] "struts her stuff" [...] as she insists that she is a [...] "big shit talker" [...] as she proclaims that [...] "I'll never play a victim/ I'd rather be a stalker". Sean Fennessey for Spin thought that when Rihanna sings the line [...] "Got <b>my</b> <b>middle</b> finger up, I don't give a fuck", it sounded as though she had never sworn before due to how she preciously mewls the word 'fuck'.|$|E
500|$|Recorded at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California by Josh Mosser, [...] "Circles" [...] {{was written}} by Christina Aguilera, Candice Pillay, Alexander Grant and Dwayne Abernathy, and it was {{produced}} by Alex da Kid. Aguilera's vocals were recorded by Oscar Ramirez at The Red Lips Room in Beverly Hills, California, while Aguilera and Pillay conducted the vocal production. Pillay also contributed additional vocals on the track, and J Browz added additional guitar. [...] "Circles" [...] is an alternative rock song, and runs for a duration of [...] (three minutes and twenty-five seconds). The lyrics of the [...] "rawky" [...] chorus, [...] "spin around in circles on <b>my</b> <b>middle</b> middle finger", has been likened to a [...] "'90s riot-grrrl". Andrew Hampp for Billboard thought as though it sounded like [...] "mini-Aguilera's" [...] were chanting the words [...] "round and round" [...] and [...] "motherfucker" [...] in childlike voices. [...] "Circles" [...] has a [...] "playground" [...] melodic structure, according to Robert Copsey of Digital Spy. He also thought the best lyrics in the song are [...] "Why you always {{trying to get up}} in my mixture?/ I think you're just bitter". At the end of the song, Aguilera speaks out loud the word [...] "motherfucker!".|$|E
2500|$|During his {{performance}} at Glastonbury in 2011, Morrissey criticised the UK prime minister, David Cameron, {{for attempting to}} stop the ban on wild animals performing in circuses, calling him a [...] "silly twit".

2500|$|She {{revealed}} that {{after she had}} quit University and moved to London, England to focus on her music, she had completely changed her Personal Appearance. She said; [...] "Doing medicine, I {{had to be very}} conservative in how I looked and dressed. But arriving in London from Scotland, it seemed appropriate to ask myself, OK, if you're no longer a medic, who are you?" [...] Sand√© took her middle name Emeli on professionally two years before she hit the limelight as Adele had just risen to prominence. [...] "I changed it as soon as Adele came out. I just thought, 'You've kind of taken the [...] now', so I went with <b>my</b> <b>middle</b> name. She was just getting bigger and bigger, so I thought I just really need it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Streisand {{changed her}} name from [...] "Barbara" [...] to [...] "Barbra" [...] because, she said, [...] "I hated the name, but I refused to change it." [...] Streisand further explained, [...] "Well, I was 18 and I {{wanted to be}} unique, but I didn't want to change my name because that was too false. You know, people were saying you could be Joanie Sands, or {{something}} like that. (<b>My</b> <b>middle</b> name is Joan.) And I said, 'No, let's see, if I take out the 'a,' it's still 'Barbara,' but it's unique." [...] A 1967 biography with a concert program said, [...] "the spelling of her first name is an instance of partial rebellion: she was advised to change her last name and retaliated by dropping an [...] "a" [...] from the first instead." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 8 April, EMI reissued {{the single}} [...] "The Last of the Famous International Playboys" [...] backed by three new songs, [...] "People Are the Same Everywhere", [...] "Action Is <b>My</b> <b>Middle</b> Name", and [...] "The Kid's a Looker", all {{recorded}} live in 2011.

On 22 July, Morrissey announced the cancellation of the South American leg of his tour due to a [...] "lack of funding", saying it was [...] "the last of many final straws".|$|E
60|$|I do not {{remember}} anything of my father's earlier and more energetic time. I was the child of <b>my</b> parents' <b>middle</b> years; they married {{when my father was}} thirty-five and my mother past forty, and I saw only the last decadent phase of his educational career.|$|R

5000|$|There {{is nothing}} {{sinister}} about this {{nor does it}} {{have anything to do}} with the Bible's [...] "mark of the beast" [...] (The New Testament, The Revelation, Chapter 13, paragraph 18).

2500|$|Dirk Benedict (born 1 March 1945) is an American actor, {{best known}} for playing Face in The A-Team and Starbuck in the {{original}} Battlestar Galactica. Dirk made a unique entrance to the house by arriving via (a replica of) The A-Team van, smoking a cigar and with the theme tune playing in the background. A memorable moment occurred {{a few minutes after}} he arrived in the house, when a drunk Donny said [...] "It's Dirk fucking Benedict", to which Dirk responded [...] "I seldom use <b>my</b> <b>middle</b> name." [...] Dirk made no secret of his attraction to Shilpa, even saying that he would marry her in a moment, although his attention and flirting with her was light hearted and not excessive. On Day 2, a comic feel surrounded Dirk as Shilpa learned to pronounce his name. Dirk finished third on the final night.|$|E
2500|$|Brando {{acknowledged}} {{his professional}} decline, writing later, [...] "Some {{of the films}} I made during the sixties were successful; some weren't. Some, like The Night of the Following Day, I made only for the money; others, like Candy, I did because a friend asked me to and I didn't want to turn him down... In some ways I think of <b>my</b> <b>middle</b> age as the Fuck You Years." [...] Candy was especially appalling for many; a 1968 sex farce film directed by Christian Marquand {{and based on the}} 1958 novel by Terry Southern, the movie satirizes pornographic stories through the adventures of its naive heroine, Candy, played by Ewa Aulin. It is generally regarded as the nadir of Brando's career. The Washington Post observed: [...] "Brando's self-indulgence over a dozen years is costing him and his public his talents." [...] In the March 1966 issue of The Atlantic, Pauline Kael wrote that in his rebellious days, Brando [...] "was antisocial because he knew society was crap; he was a hero to youth because he was strong enough not to take the crap", but now Brando and others like him had become [...] "buffoons, shamelessly, pathetically mocking their public reputations." [...] In an earlier review of The Appaloosa in 1966, Kael wrote that the actor was [...] "trapped in another dog of a movie... Not for the first time, Mr. Brando gives us a heavy-lidded, adenoidally openmouthed caricature of the inarticulate, stalwart loner." [...] Although he feigned indifference, Brando was hurt by the critical mauling, admitting in the 2015 film Listen to Me Marlon, [...] "They can hit you every day and you have no way of fighting back. I was very convincing in my pose of indifference, but I was very sensitive and it hurt a lot." ...|$|E

60|$|I suppose I publish {{and leave}} the whole gathering, first, from that eternal {{tendency}} to perpetuate and preserve which is behind all Nature, authors included; second, to symbolize two or three specimen interiors, personal and other, out of the myriads of <b>my</b> time, the <b>middle</b> range of the Nineteenth century in the New World; a strange, unloosen'd, wondrous time.

Their stories parallel but cannot encompass the private experiences of all service women. I am grateful for their generosity; without them there would be no pictures. The battle for equality is much older than Rosie the Riveter but we still ask the same questions we asked Joan of Arc in the 15 th century: if she isn‚Äôt working miracles, what is she doing on the battlefield...|$|R

I took De from my mother‚Äôs maiden name, De Groot, and <b>my</b> father‚Äôs <b>middle</b> name was Paul‚Äù. [...] Released as a single, [...] "Sugar Me" [...] reached the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart, as well as the top of the singles charts in the Netherlands, Spain and Belgium.
