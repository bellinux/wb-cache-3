5|$|Western jackdaws {{have learned}} to peck open the foil caps of milk bottles left on the doorsteps after {{delivery}} by the milkman. The bacterium Campylobacter jejuni has been isolated from their beaks and cloacae so <b>milk</b> <b>can</b> become contaminated as they drink. This activity was linked to cases of Campylobacter gastroenteritis in Gateshead in northeast England and led the Department of Health to suggest that milk from bottles which had been pecked open should be discarded. It was recommended that steps be taken to prevent birds attacking bottles in future.|$|E

5000|$|Milk {{has long}} been a staple food of {{agricultural}} societies. Fresh milk sours quickly if kept warm. Railways were used as early as 1840 to rapidly transport fresh milk from farms to cities. Early milk transport was in covered, tin-plated steel cans containing about 10 gal. Passenger trains typically offered the fastest service, so <b>milk</b> <b>cans</b> might have first been loaded into baggage cars. A farmer would adjust his herd milking schedule to have the <b>milk</b> <b>cans</b> filled shortly before scheduled arrival of the train. When multiple farmers required shipment, a separate car might be carried by the train specifically for milk cans; and that car could be delivered directly to the creamery to minimize time required for intermediate handling of the <b>milk</b> <b>cans</b> with other baggage. Once the handling advantages of a separate car were recognized, milk cars were built with insulation to reduce warming during transit and the <b>milk</b> <b>cans</b> might be packed in ice during warm weather. [...] A few milk cars were built or retrofitted with mechanical refrigeration following World War II.|$|R

25|$|Used {{to be sold}} in cooled 1 liter bags, {{just like}} in South Africa. Today {{the most common form}} is 1 liter aseptic cartons {{containing}} UHT skimmed, semi-skimmed or whole milk, although the plastic bags are still in use for pasteurized milk. Higher grades of pasteurized <b>milk</b> <b>can</b> be found in cartons or plastic bottles. Sizes other than 1 liter are rare.|$|E
25|$|Milk {{has been}} also {{recommended}} as a storage medium for avulsed teeth. Its advantage {{is the high}} availability of fresh whole milk. Only whole <b>milk</b> <b>can</b> be used for tooth preservation. Skim milk and heavy cream {{do not have the}} correct fluid pressure and will cause damage to the root cells. Milk has no observed regenerative properties for cells on knocked out teeth.|$|E
25|$|Pasteurization is {{the reason}} for milk's {{extended}} shelf life. High-temperature, short-time (HTST) pasteurized milk typically has a refrigerated shelf life of two to three weeks, whereas ultra-pasteurized <b>milk</b> <b>can</b> last much longer, sometimes two to three months. When ultra-heat treatment (UHT) is combined with sterile handling and container technology (such as aseptic packaging), it can even be stored unrefrigerated for up to 9 months.|$|E

Over time the milking {{pipeline}} and equipment can become coated with residues such as milkstone which are not removed by standard detergents and require periodic flushing of equipment with high strength corrosives.

25|$|Lactose-free <b>milk</b> <b>can</b> be {{produced}} by passing milk over lactase enzyme bound to an inert carrier. Once the molecule is cleaved, there are no lactose ill effects. Forms are available with reduced amounts of lactose (typically 30% of normal), and alternatively with nearly 0%. The only noticeable difference from regular milk is a slightly sweeter taste due to the generation of glucose by lactose cleavage. It does not, however, contain more glucose, and is nutritionally identical to regular milk.|$|E
25|$|Babies feed {{differently}} {{with artificial}} nipples {{than from a}} breast. With the breast, the infant's tongue massages the milk out rather than sucking, and the nipple does not go as far into the mouth. Drinking from a bottle takes less effort and the milk may come more rapidly, potentially causing the baby to lose desire for the breast. This is called nursing strike, nipple strike or nipple confusion. To avoid this, expressed <b>milk</b> <b>can</b> be given by means such as spoons or cups.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} food group that {{contains}} naturally sour foods is fruit, such as lemon, grape, orange, tamarind, and sometimes melon. Wine also usually has a sour tinge to its flavor, {{and if not}} kept correctly, <b>milk</b> <b>can</b> spoil and develop a sour taste. Children in the US and UK show a greater enjoyment of sour flavors than adults, and sour candy is popular in North America including Cry Babies, Warheads, Lemon drops, Shock Tarts and sour versions of Skittles and Starburst. Many of these candies contain citric acid.|$|E
25|$|Milk {{collected}} or {{stored in}} unsanitary conditions may harbor {{a host of}} disease-causing organisms (pathogens), such as tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis), the bacteria Campylobacter (Campylobacteriosis), Escherichia E. coli O157:H7), Listeria (Listeriosis), Salmonella (Salmonellosis), Yersinia (Yersinia enterocolitica), and Brucella (Brucellosis). Pasteurization consistently removes all of these pathogens, though they can be reintroduced if the product is handled carelessly. Thus dairy farms that pasteurize their <b>milk</b> <b>can</b> have unsanitary facilities without the attendant outbreaks of disease that would occur if a raw milk dairy kept its herds in similar unsanitary conditions.|$|E
25|$|For some foods, {{health issues}} are {{important}} in determining shelf life. Bacterial contaminants are ubiquitous, and foods left unused too long will often be contaminated by substantial amounts of bacterial colonies and become dangerous to eat, leading to food poisoning. However, shelf life alone is not an accurate indicator of how long the food can safely be stored. For example, pasteurized <b>milk</b> <b>can</b> remain fresh for five days after its sell-by date if it is refrigerated properly. However, improper storage of milk may result in bacterial contamination or spoilage before the expiration date.|$|E
