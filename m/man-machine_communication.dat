Their behavior {{is therefore not}} deterministic and hardly predictable. This makes the simulation and the optimization of such systems performances difficult, {{as well as the}} reuse of previous work to build new systems. In the aim of a partially automated optimization of such systems, this paper presents a formalism attempt for the description of <b>man-machine</b> spoken <b>communication</b> in the framework of spoken dialog systems. This formalization is partly based on a probabilistic description of the information processing occurring in each module composing a spoken dialog system but also on a stochastic user modeling.

50|$|For example, in {{traditional}} forms of face-to-face communication, humans communicate through non-verbal as well as verbal sign-systems; colloquially, this {{can be referred to}} as body language. Hence, humans communicate a great deal by way of facial movements and other forms of bodily expression. Such expressions are also signs and an organised collection of such signs would be considered a sign system. Second, the same concept of a sign-system can be used in considering a vast range of communication forms such as animal communication and <b>man-machine</b> <b>communication.</b> Examination of simpler forms of such systems of signs within non-human communication can help to illuminate some of the essence of communication and in particular can help to provide tentative answers {{to the question of the}} nature and function of communication.|$|E

This paper reviews our {{proposed}} {{approach to}} voice conversion (VC) and voice quality control {{based on an}} eigenvoice technique. VC is a technique to modify nonlinguistic information such as speaker individuality while keeping linguistic information unchanged. In the traditional VC framework, a conversion model for a source and target speaker-pair needs to be trained in advance using a parallel data set consisting of utterance-pairs of these two speakers. To make VC technologies more practical, we have developed a new VC paradigm for flexibly building the conversion model for an arbitrary speaker-pair by effectively using speech samples of many other speakers. In this paper, we give an overview of eigenvoice conversion (EVC) {{as one of our}} proposed VC techniques...|$|R

40|$|Expressed {{in terms}} of speed and accuracy, {{intention}} transfer in goal-oriented inter-human communication can be very efficient. One of the mechanisms that make for efficient communication is early detection and repair of communication errors. Another important efficiency mechanism prevents repeated communication of detailed descriptions {{by the use of}} anaphora. For communication between man and machine to become more natural and efficient, it is assumed that man-machine interfaces should also support these mechanisms. It is shown that a layered protocol architecture for <b>man-machine</b> <b>communication</b> supports early detection and repair of communication errors if structured messages are used for intention transfer. It is also shown that primitive referencing mechanisms similar to anaphora are used in <b>man-machine</b> <b>communication.</b> However, these mechanisms are sometimes counter-productive and have to be refined in order to support efficient communication...|$|E

Segmental and suprasegmental properties of spontaneous speech have been shown to differ significantly from those of read speech; nevertheless, much of the data used to develop <b>man-machine</b> speech <b>communication</b> systems has, for the most part, been based on read speech. Experiments designed to elicit a full range of L 2 English segmental and prosodic features in spontaneous speech could efficiently collect an inventory of these features in a database, which could be used for further phonetic studies as well as modeling and ICT tool development tailored to the Asian L 2 English-speaking population...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel {{approach}} to acoustic model training for non-audible murmur (NAM) recognition using normal speech data transformed into NAM data. NAM is extremely soft murmur, that is so quiet that people around the speaker can hardly hear it. It is detected directly through the soft tissue of the head using a special body-conductive microphone, NAM microphone, placed on the neck below the ear. NAM recognition {{is one of the}} promising silent speech interfaces for <b>man-machine</b> speech <b>communication.</b> We have previously shown the effectiveness of speaker adaptive training (SAT) based on constrained maximum likelihood linear regression (CMLLR) in NAM acoustic model training. However, since the amount of available NAM data is still small, the effect of SAT is limited. In this paper we propose modified SAT methods capable of using a larger amount of normal speech data by transforming them into NAM data. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods yield an absolute increase of approximately 2 % in word accuracy compared with the conventional method.

5000|$|It {{is argued}} that a turning point was the {{development}} of the SKETCHPAD system at MIT by Ivan Sutherland (who later created a graphics technology company with David Evans). The distinctive feature of SKETCHPAD was that it allowed the designer to interact with his computer graphically: the design can be fed into the computer by drawing on a CRT monitor with a light pen. Effectively, it was a prototype of graphical user interface, an indispensable feature of modern CAD. Sutherland presented his paper Sketchpad: A <b>Man-Machine</b> Graphical <b>Communication</b> System in 1963 at a Joint Computer Conference having worked on it as his PhD thesis paper for a few years. Quoting, [...] "For drawings where motion of the drawing, or analysis of a drawn problem is of value to the user, Sketchpad excels. For highly repetitive drawings or drawings where accuracy is required, Sketchpad is sufficiently faster than conventional techniques to be worthwhile. For drawings which merely communicate with shops, it is probably better to use conventional paper and pencil." [...] Over time efforts would be directed toward the goal of having the designers drawings communicate not just with shops but with the shop tool itself. This goal would be a long time arriving.|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{we address}} the issue of {{encoding}} and recognition of face sequences that arise from continuous head movement.

40|$|Within {{the area}} of {{advanced}} <b>man-machine</b> interaction, speech <b>communication</b> has always {{played a major role}} for several decades. The idea of replacing the convential input devices such as buttons and keyboard by voice control and thus increasing the comfort and the input speed considerably, seems that much attractive, that even the quite slow progress of speech technology during those decades could not discourage people from pursuing that goal. However, nowadays this area is in a different situation than in those earlier times, and these facts shall be also considered in this book section: First of all, speech technology has reached a much higher degree of maturity, mainly through the technique of stochastic modeling which shall be briefly introduced in this chapter. Secondly, other interaction techniques became more mature, too, and in the framework of that development, speech became one of the preferred modalities of multimodal interaction, e. g. as ideal complementary mode to pointing or gesture. This shall be also reflected in the subsection on multimodal interaction. Another relatively recent development is the fact that speech is not only a carrier of linguistic information, but also one of emotional information...|$|R
