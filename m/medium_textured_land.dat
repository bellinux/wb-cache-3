A drawn cultivator/ridger with spring tines on a parallelogram framework and wing ridge heads attached (STC), was com¬pared with a drawn cultivator/ridger with rigid tines on a parallelogram framework and cogwheel ridge discs attached (RTC) and with a rotary, PTO-driven cultivator/ridger (RC). The latter created the largest cross-sectional area of the ridge and proved to be the most efficient at crushing soil aggregates in the inter-row space and at ridge shap¬ing.

A higher number of tubers per plant resulted from ridges made by the PTO-driven cultivator/ridger giving a higher total yield of tubers than with the other two cultivators/ridgers.

40|$|The Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) {{method is}} widely used for {{predicting}} direct runoff volume for a given rainfall event. The applicability of the SCS-CN method and the direct runoff generation mechanism were thoroughly analysed in a Mediterranean experimental watershed in Greece.

A detailed land cover and soil survey using remote sensing and GIS techniques, showed that the watershed is dominated by coarse soils with high hydraulic conductivities, whereas a smaller part is covered with <b>medium</b> <b>textured</b> soils and impervious surfaces. The analysis indicated that the SCS-CN method fails to predict runoff for the storm events studied, {{and that there is a}} strong correlation between the CN values obtained from measured runoff and the rainfall depth.

Numerical runs were performed using the HYDRUS- 1 D code. The results support the validity of this hypothesis for most of the events examined where the linear runoff formula provides better results than the SCS-CN method. The runoff coefficient of this formula can be taken equal to the percentage of the impervious area.

Different soil types have variable susceptibility to erosion. Fine textured clay soils and coarse textured sandy soils have low K values; <b>medium</b> <b>textured</b> silt and loam soils have moderate K values, while soils with high silt content have high K values due to their inherent physical property of soils (McCool et al. 1995; Renard et al. 1996). Similarly, soil organic matter reduces K values because it produces compounds that bind soil particles together and increases aggregation by reducing detaching effect of raindrop, increasing infiltration and reducing surface runoff (Wischmeier and Smith 1978; Renard et al. 1996, 2011). However, the K-factor determined by soil color in Hurni (1985) is often not very precise given the fact that soils of the same color have quite different K values (Kaltenrieder 2007). Therefore, K is a function of particle size, drainage potential, structural stability, organic matter content, and cohesiveness.|$|R

In our study, the EM 38 (made by GEONICS) has an intercoil spacing of 1 m, allowing the measurement of soil salinity down {{to a depth of}} 2 meters. Calibration of instrument readings versus soil salinity has been done either by comparison with the four electrode probe response, or directly from the electric conductivity measurements of saturated paste extract. However, these calibrations are convenient for large surveys as long as soil porosity and soil water content are reasonnably constant, so that the calibration holds.

Furthermore, soil moisture content is highly variable and its effect cannot be neglected in surveys.
