40|$|This {{report is}} an {{explanation}} about actuation system design for solar car. The word actuation is almost same with propulsion. This actuation system involved motor, motor controller and transmission system. Actuation system is vital {{in order to}} make sure solar car able to run smoothly when power is supplied. Without proper actuation system design, the power system design that been developed by other person is useless. This system also crucial to ensure safety to driver when driving solar car. Analyses have been done to select suitable electrical device before the devices have been bought. Besides, in this report, <b>motor</b> <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket</b> have been designed and analyzed in software ALGOR. The purpose is to ensure the bracket can withstand vibration of motor and avoid failure. Comparison between AC motor and DC motor are made to compare the torque and power produced. Solar car use simple transmission which is belt drive. Gear ratio analysis is made to ensure correct ratio and car can move with no problem. Then gear ratio analysis is used to consider which torque converter is suitable. This project is successfully completed when every basic part needed for actuation system is analyzed and designed...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{aluminum}} alloy castings for safety critical structural components such as engine <b>mount</b> <b>brackets,</b> steering knuckles, and control arms, offers significant opportunities for achieving weight reduction in automobiles, {{since they are}} typically about half {{the weight of the}} steel, cast iron, or ductile iron component that they replace. Metal Compression Forming (MCF) is a variant of the squeeze casting process, in which molten metal is allowed to solidify under pressure in order to close porosity and form a sound part. However, the MCF process applies pressure on the entire mold face, thereby directing pressure on all regions of the casting and producing a uniformly sound part. The process is capable of producing parts with properties close to those of forgings, while retaining the near net shape, complexity in geometry, and relatively low cost of the casting process. The paper describes the casting process development involved in the production of an aluminum A 357 alloy <b>motor</b> <b>mount</b> <b>bracket,</b> including the use of a filling and solidification model to design the gating and determine process parameters. Tensile properties of the component are presented and correlated with those of forged components. Limited fatigue properties obtained by fully reversed strain controlled testing are also presented...|$|R
50|$|Trim is {{the angle}} of the motor in {{relation}} to the hull, as illustrated below. The ideal trim angle is the one in which the boat rides level, with most of the hull on the surface instead of plowing through the water.If the motor is trimmed out too far, the bow will ride too high in the water. With too little trim, the bow rides too low. The optimal trim setting will vary depending on many factors including speed, hull design, weight and balance, and conditions on the water (wind and waves). Many large outboards are equipped with power trim, an electric <b>motor</b> on the <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket,</b> with a switch at the helm that enables the operator to adjust the trim angle on the fly. In this case, the motor should be trimmed fully in to start, and trimmed out (with an eye on the tachometer) as the boat gains momentum, until it reaches the point just before ventilation begins or further trim adjustment results in an RPM increase with no increase in speed. Motors not equipped with power trim are manually adjustable using a pin called a topper tilt lock.|$|R

5|$|During the investigation, an {{examination}} of the pylon attachment points revealed damage to the wing's pylon <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket</b> that matched the shape of the pylon's rear attachment fitting. This meant that the pylon attachment fitting had struck the <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket</b> at some point. This was important evidence, as the only way the pylon fitting could strike the wing's <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket</b> in the observed manner was if the bolts that held the pylon to the wing had been removed and the engine/pylon assembly was being supported by something other than the aircraft itself. Hence investigators were able to conclude that the observed damage to the rear pylon mount had been present before the crash, rather than being caused by it.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} causes of {{vibration}} that produce by a car is engine and transmission. Engine and transmission location determination is an important thing that must be considered for a car. Method of locating engine and transmission will be proposed to determine the right position. This method depends to the size and type of engines. The project objective {{is to find a}} location for the engine <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket</b> for a new car. It is important to reduce the vibration from the engine and transmission to the carâ€™s body or chassis. These is also important to fit the engine bay before consider the component of engine clearance with component of body. The stress analysis is done for the location test, different thickness of side member, and different cross section of side member. The FEA software Algor is use for this analysis and Solidwork to modeling the side member. Five different cross section and design are use to analyze the location of the engine <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket.</b> The range location of the <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket</b> is at the middle of the side member. This range depends to the packaging of the engine and the clearance between the components of engine with engine bay. Thickness of the side member also important to decrease the weight of the car and to minimize the stress value when load apply. For conclusion, not all the car has same location of <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket</b> location and many thing must consider before determine this location. The designs of side member influence the location of the <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket...</b>|$|R

40|$|Engine mounts have an {{important}} function of containing firmly the power-train components of a vehicle. Correct geometry and positioning of the <b>mount</b> <b>brackets</b> on the chassis ensures a good ride quality and performance. As an FSAE car intends to be a high performance vehicle, the brackets on the frame that support the engine undergo high static and dynamic stresses as well as huge amount of vibrations. Hence, dissipating the vibrational energy and keeping the stresses under a pre-determined level of safety should be achieved by careful designing {{and analysis of the}} <b>mount</b> <b>brackets.</b> Keeping this in mind the current paper discusses the modeling, Finite Element Analysis, Modal analysis and mass optimization of engine <b>mount</b> <b>brackets</b> for a FSAE car.

40|$|Abstract- This work {{is based}} on the {{analysis}} of engine <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket.</b> There are four <b>mounting</b> <b>brackets</b> to <b>mount</b> engine on vehicle chassis. Analysis is done for only one bracket and the results are considered for other three brackets. Due to the increase in global competitive market, automotive designs are pushed to the limits to decrease the cost {{and at the same time}} increase the stiffness to mass ratio and performance. Above all, the biggest constraint is to achieve all these with reduced design time. In order to get better designs, industries are using tools like FEM Optimization; these techniques are useful in designing the new shape and size with reduced design time. New Topology optimization tool is used in this work in designing engine <b>mounting</b> <b>bracket</b> for analysis to get better design with less time. It also helps in the reduction of unwanted material and thereby mass of the component decreases respectively...|$|R
