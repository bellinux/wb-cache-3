5|$|Negroes are not {{barred from}} {{organized}} baseball by the commissioner {{and never have}} been in the 21years I have served. There is no rule in organized baseball prohibiting their participation and never has been to <b>my</b> <b>knowledge.</b> If Durocher, or if any other manager, or all of them, want to sign one, or twenty-five Negro players, it is all right with me. That is the business of the managers and the club owners. The business of the commissioner is to interpret the rules of baseball, and to enforce them.|$|E

5|$|So {{yesterday}} morning the Tories, {{by the hand}} of Mr Calcraft, accomplished the final act of separation between England and Ireland. The only thing that the Fenians still lacked were martyrs. They have been provided by Derby and G Hardy. Only {{the execution of the}} three has made the liberation of Kelly and Deasy the heroic deed which will now be sung to every Irish babe in the cradle in Ireland, England and America... To <b>my</b> <b>knowledge,</b> the only time that anybody has been executed for a similar matter in a civilised country was the case of John Brown at Harpers Ferry. The Fenians could not have wished for a better precedent. The Southerners had at least the decency to treat J. Brown as a rebel, whereas here everything is being done to transform a political attempt into a common crime.|$|E

I have been advising a top premiership star who is bisexual. If it came out that he had gay tendencies, his career would be over in two minutes. Should it be? No, but if you go on the terraces and hear the way fans are, and also, that kind of general attitude that goes with football, it's almost like going back to the dark ages.|$|E

25|$|In his 1997 {{submission}} to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, General Malan described the CCB as follows:"15.1 Let me now {{deal with the}} matter of the CCB. The CCB-organisation as a component of Special Forces was approved in principle by me. Special Forces was an integral and supportive part of the South African Defence Force. The role envisaged for the CCB was the infiltration and penetration of the enemy, the gathering of information and the disruption of the enemy. The CCB was approved as an organisation consisting of ten divisions, or as expressed in military jargon, regions. Eight of these divisions or regions were intended to refer to geographical areas. The area of one of these regions, Region Six, referred to the Republic of South Africa. The fact that the organisation in Region Six was activated, came to <b>my</b> <b>knowledge</b> {{for the first time in}} November 1989. The CCB provided the South African Defence Force with good covert capabilities.|$|E
25|$|If {{the law is}} made as it {{now stands}} respectable {{families}} in Aiken, Barnwell, Colleton, and Orangeburg will be {{denied the right to}} intermarry among people with whom they are now associated and identified. At least one hundred families would be affected to <b>my</b> <b>knowledge.</b> They have sent good soldiers to the Confederate Army, and are now landowners and taxpayers. Those men served creditably, and it would be unjust and disgraceful to embarrass them in this way. It is a scientific fact that there is not one full-blooded Caucasian on the floor of this convention. Every member has in him a certain mixture of… colored blood. The pure-blooded white has needed and received a certain infusion of darker blood to give him readiness and purpose. It would be a cruel injustice and the source of endless litigation, of scandal, horror, feud, and bloodshed to undertake to annul or forbid marriage for a remote, perhaps obsolete trace of Negro blood. The doors would be open to scandal, malice and greed; to statements on the witness stand that the father or grandfather or grandmother had said that A or B had Negro blood in their veins. Any man who is half a man would be ready to blow up half the world with dynamite to prevent or avenge attacks upon the honor of his mother in the legitimacy or purity of the blood of his father.|$|E

500|$|This episode {{introduces}} the character Michonne, a protagonist in the comic {{series of the}} same name who is portrayed by Danai Gurira. Gurira was cast as part of the series a week before the broadcasting of [...] "Beside the Dying Fire," [...] although rumors of introducing Michonne circulated months prior to the season finale. Kirkman admitted that he was a fan of her work in the HBO drama series Treme. Rutina Wesley, who played Tara Thornton in True Blood, was rumored to be considered for the role of Michonne, although Kirkman stated that she was never involved in the auditioning process. [...] "It was a lot of actresses. The True Blood actress, I don't know that she was even available; I think she's still on True Blood. I don't know where that rumor came from, but to <b>my</b> <b>knowledge,</b> she was never involved." ...|$|E
500|$|Thrale {{explains}} that her {{book is not}} for [...] "diary-keeping in the strict sense" [...] when she writes: [...] "It is many Years since Doctor Samuel Johnson advised {{me to get a}} little Book, and write in it all the little Anecdotes which might come to <b>my</b> <b>Knowledge,</b> all the Observations I might make or hear; all the Verses never likely to be published, and in fine ev'ry thing which struck me at the Time. Mr Thrale has now treated me with a Repository, - and provided it with the pompous Title of Thraliana; I must endeavour to fill it with Nonsense new and old." [...] These encouraging remarks from Johnson set the theme of the work as it became a new [...] "Johnsoniana" [...] collection. In particular, she transferred her previous notes and documentations about Johnson's life into the collection.|$|E
