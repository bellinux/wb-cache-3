It was completely counter to the shellacked, flashy aesthetic of the 1980s in every way. In disheveled jeans and floral frocks, he softened the tough exterior of the archetypal rebel from the inside out, and set the ball in motion for a radical, millennial idea of androgyny." [...] Cobain's way of dressing [...] "was {{the antithesis of the}} macho American man", because he [...] "...made it cooler to look slouchy and loose, no <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were a boy or a girl." [...] Music and culture writer Julianne Escobedo Shepherd wrote that with Cobain's style of dress “Not only did he make it okay to be a freak, he made it desirable." ...|$|E
500|$|Malicious rumours {{concerning}} Wenger's {{private life}} surfaced during November 1996, {{to the extent}} the City of London reported that his exit from Arsenal was imminent. Having returned {{from a trip to}} Strasbourg to visit his parents, Wenger attended a press meeting and strongly refuted the claims: [...] "If something comes out that is wrong, I will attack. It is a serious <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can just create things that are not right." [...] Arsenal's press officer Clare Tomlinson, who was present at the news conference, recalled Wenger phoning the next day and demanding why he could not take action against the press for printing the story. The culprit responsible for spreading gossip in the City later apologised to Wenger. During this, Arsenal had led the Premier League, but poor form in February 1997 caused Wenger to rule out his team's chances of winning the title. They finished third in his first season, missing out on UEFA Champions League qualification to Newcastle United on goal difference – the tiebreaker used to determine the ranking between teams equal on points.|$|E
500|$|... "Don't You Wanna Stay" [...] is {{a country}} pop song with a length of four minutes and sixteen seconds. It {{incorporates}} melancholic guitar riff which is accompanied by classical elements such as violin. Mikael Wood of Billboard described the song as [...] "a dramatic, slow building power ballad {{in the style of}} Bonnie Tyler's [...] "Total Eclipse of the Heart"", a view held similar by John Hill of About.com who considered the song as a [...] "classic power ballad", writing [...] "whether you want to call the song country, pop, or something in between doesn't matter because the chorus is so catchy that it doesn't <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> use an electric guitar or a steel guitar." [...] It is set in common time and has a steady tempo of 72 beats per minute. It is written in the key of G-sharp minor and both Aldean and Clarkson's vocals span two octaves, from A♯3 to G♯5. It follows the chord progression G♯m–E–B. Bob Peacock of Roughstock thought that the structure of the song was interesting with its brief four-line verses and [...] "don't you wanna stay's throughout the chorus. As the chorus of the song starts in, the sound of electric and slide guitars are prominent as Aldean and Clarkson sing, [...] "Don't you wanna hold each other tight / Don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight?" ...|$|E

500|$|... "Born This Way" [...] {{was written}} by Gaga and Jeppe Laursen (formerly of the band Junior Senior), and {{produced}} with Paul Blair (a.k.a. DJ White Shadow) and Fernando Garibay, while it was mixed at Abbey Road Studios in London and Germano Studios in New York. The electropop song begins with Gaga's voice uttering the line [...] "It doesn't <b>matter</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> love him or capital H-I-M" [...] on a loop, backed by a rumbling synth sound and a humming bass. As the synths change into a beat, Gaga belts out the song's first verse, followed by the bass dropping off and the percussion-backed chorus, [...] "I'm beautiful in my way, 'cause God makes no mistakes; I'm on the right track, baby, I was born this way", which Jocelyn Vena from MTV likened as being [...] "meant {{to be heard in}} a big space. It's fast and hard-hitting." [...] After the chorus she chants the line [...] "Don't be a drag, Just be a queen" [...] a number of times on top of handclaps, before moving to the second verse. After the second chorus an interlude follows, where Gaga chants the names of various communities. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine felt that the interlude is a mixture of the music from American television show, Glee, and the song [...] "There But For the Grace of God Go I" [...] by Machine. The music fades out for a moment as Gaga sings a cappella, before the addition of an organ and Gaga closes the song. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "Born This Way" [...] is written in the time signature of common time, with a moderate dance beat tempo of 124 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of B major as Gaga's voice spans the tonal nodes of F3 to C5. [...] "Born This Way" [...] follows a chord progression of F5–F–E–B–F in the chorus.|$|E
