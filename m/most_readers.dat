5|$|The Age of Reason {{provoked}} a hostile reaction from <b>most</b> <b>readers</b> and critics, although {{the intensity of}} that hostility varied by locality. There were four major factors for this animosity: Paine denied that the Bible was a sacred, inspired text; he argued that Christianity was a human invention; his ability to command a large readership frightened those in power; and his irreverent and satirical style of writing about Christianity and the Bible offended many believers.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} a {{commercial}} failure in Japan {{but has been}} successful in the United States. Critical consensus is that Zombiepowder. was a technically proficient manga, but one which lacked the originality necessary to bear intrinsic appeal to <b>most</b> <b>readers,</b> which accounted for its cancellation. Additionally, the series was heavily focused on battles even by the standards of action manga, though whether this was a positive or negative trait is a matter of contention. Due to these factors, combined with its abrupt and unsatisfactory ending, critics hold that Zombiepowder. is significant primarily as a chapter in the career of its author, and would otherwise be a footnote which found an audience only among fans of violent action.|$|E
5|$|From the 1980s onwards, {{homosexuality}} gained {{much wider}} mainstream acceptance, and was often incorporated into otherwise conventional speculative fiction stories. Works emerged that went beyond simple representation of homosexuality to explorations of specific issues {{relevant to the}} LGBT community. This development was helped by {{the growing number of}} openly gay or lesbian authors and their early acceptance by speculative fiction fandom. Specialist gay publishing presses and a number of awards recognising LGBT achievements in the genre emerged, and by the twenty-first century blatant homophobia was no longer considered acceptable by <b>most</b> <b>readers</b> of speculative fiction. There was a concurrent increase in representation of homosexuality within non-literary forms of speculative fiction. The inclusion of LGBT themes in comic books, television and film continues to attract media attention and controversy, while the perceived lack of sufficient representation, along with unrealistic depictions, provokes criticism from LGBT sources.|$|E

25|$|When {{the series}} was {{reaching}} its climax, Wings editor Miki Ishikawa remembers receiving several letters in which fans requested for a happy ending.

The writers from Manga Book Shelf noted that the series' open ending has also been a subject of criticism within fans.|$|E
25|$|In a few {{specific}} circumstances (such as {{the construction}} of large indices), it becomes necessary to ensure that each compound has a unique name: This requires the addition of extra rules to the standard IUPAC system (the CAS system is {{the most commonly used}} in this context), at the expense of having names that are longer and less familiar to <b>most</b> <b>readers.</b> Another system gaining popularity is the International Chemical Identifier (InChI) – which reflects a substance's structure and composition, making it more general than a CAS number.|$|E

25|$|The term {{elementary}} generally denotes {{a method}} that does not use complex analysis. For example, the prime number theorem was first proven using complex analysis in 1896, but an elementary proof was found only in 1949 by Erdős and Selberg. The term is somewhat ambiguous: for example, proofs based on complex Tauberian theorems (e.g. Wiener–Ikehara) are often seen as quite enlightening but not elementary, in spite of using Fourier analysis, rather than complex analysis as such. Here as elsewhere, an elementary proof may be longer and more difficult for <b>most</b> <b>readers</b> than a non-elementary one.|$|E
25|$|Many {{long-established}} words, such as disgusted, degrade, and refresh, do {{not require}} a hyphen because they are fully fused {{to the point that}} their first syllable is barely even thought about as having a prefix function. Many other words, such as prewashed or repainted, may not be quite so fully fused (the prefix function may be slightly more prominent in consciousness), but nonetheless they require no hyphen, because (1) <b>most</b> <b>readers</b> recognize the closed-up word as a familiar one and thus have no trouble parsing the syllables, and (2) if all such words were hyphenated, the many hyphens throughout the text would seem superfluous.|$|E
25|$|Consequently, {{readers of}} 18th-century {{literature}} now {{need to understand}} the history of the period more than <b>most</b> <b>readers</b> of other literature do. The authors were writing for an informed audience and only secondarily for posterity. Even the authors, who criticised writing that lived for only a day (like Jonathan Swift and Alexander Pope, in The Dedication to Prince Posterity of A Tale of a Tub and Dunciad, among other pieces) were criticising specific authors, who are unknown to those without historical knowledge of the period. Poetry of all forms was in constant dialogue, and each author was responding and commenting upon the others. Novels were written against other novels (like the battles between Samuel Richardson and Henry Fielding, who, along with Eliza Haywood, wrote a novel satirising Richardson's Pamela, and between Laurence Sterne and Tobias Smollett). Plays were written to make fun of plays or to counter the success of plays (like the reaction against and for Cato and, later, Fielding's The Author's Farce). Therefore, history and literature are linked in a way rarely seen at other times. On one hand, the metropolitan and political writing can seem like coterie or salon work, but on the other hand, it was the literature of people deeply committed to sorting out a new type of government, new technologies and newly-vexatious challenges to philosophical and religious certainty.|$|E

Of the novel, Penman states, “I think Dragons is so popular because it was virgin {{territory}} for <b>most</b> <b>readers.</b> The saga of the Plantagenets was much better known, but not many people were familiar with medieval Wales or its princes. And then, too, the story of Llewelyn the Great and Joanna, King John’s illegitimate daughter, is a remarkable one, which struck an emotional chord with many readers.” ...|$|E
500|$|Angelou {{uses the}} vernacular of African Americans, irony, understatement, and humor {{to make her}} {{statements}} about race and racism in America. [...] She acts as a spokesperson for her race in these poems, in which her use of irony and humor allows her {{to speak for the}} collective and to assume a distance in order to make comments about her themes, topics, and subjects. [...] Critic Kathy M. Essick have called the poems in Diiie [...] "protest poems".

Left Hand gives the reader very little opportunity to experience being double-gendered [...] I wanted to explore it as a natural, universal experience, instead of a weird alien condition. Back in 1968, I and <b>most</b> <b>readers</b> needed Genly Ai's POV to mediate the strangeness. I don't think we do, now. She referred to the story as a sexual footnote to Left Hand.|$|E

500|$|After the {{pushing back}} of {{boundaries}} in the 1960s and 1970s, homosexuality gained much wider acceptance, and was often incorporated into otherwise conventional SF stories with little comment. This was {{helped by the}} growing number of openly gay or lesbian authors, such as David Gerrold, Geoff Ryman, Nicola Griffith and Melissa Scott, and transgender writers such as Jessica Amanda Salmonson, an author who chronicled the progress of her gender change in the pages of The Literary Magazine of Fantasy and Terror. [...] In the 1980s, blatant homophobia was no longer considered acceptable to <b>most</b> <b>readers.</b> However, depictions of unrealistic lesbians continue to propagate for the titillation of straight men in genre works.

Wells, a [...] "very small group of writers who have used science fiction as the vehicle of philosophic ideas." [...] William DuBois called the book [...] "a first rate tour de force that is well worth the attention of every thoughtful citizen {{in this age of}} anxiety." [...] Don Guzman of the Los Angeles Times admired the novel for its suspense, wisdom, and beauty. He compared Clarke's role as a writer to that of an artist, [...] "a master of sonorous language, a painter of pictures in futuristic colors, a Chesley Bonestell with words".

[...] He abandoned a plan to restart Weird Tales in 1962, using reprints from the original magazine, after being advised by Sam Moskowitz {{that there was little}} market for weird and horror fiction at the time. [...] Instead Margulies mined the Weird Tales backfile for four anthologies which appeared in the early 1960s: The Unexpected, The Ghoul-Keepers, Weird Tales, and Worlds of Weird. [...] The latter two were ghost-edited by Moskowitz, who proposed to Margulies that when the time was right to start the magazine up again, it should include reprints from obscure sources that Moskowitz had found, rather than just stories reprinted from the first incarnation of Weird Tales.
