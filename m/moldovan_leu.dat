The economic fortunes of Moldova began to change in 2001; since then the country has seen a steady annual growth of between 5% and 10%. In the early 2000s, there was also a considerable growth of emigration of Moldovans looking for work (mostly illegally) in Italy, Portugal, Spain, Greece, Cyprus, Turkey, Russia and other countries.

The <b>Moldovan</b> <b>leu</b> was {{established}} on 29 November 1993, following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the creation of the independent republic of Moldova. It replaced the temporary cupon currency at a rate of 1 leu = 1000 cupon.|$|E
50|$|Privatization was stalled, the <b>Moldovan</b> <b>leu</b> lost 60% {{with respect}} to the US dollar within a year (August 1998-July 1999), an energy crisis swept through the country, wages and {{pensions}} were paid with a considerable delay of several months, corruption extended. The level of life plunged, with 75% of population living below the poverty line, while the economic disaster caused 600,000 people to leave the country. This eventually resulted in the interruption of relations with the International Monetary Fund.|$|E

50|$|On 2 January 1992, Moldova {{introduced}} the market reforms, of which included price liberalization. This {{resulted in a}} 2,600% inflation in 1992, and a further 700% inflation in 1993. From 1992 till 2001, the young country suffered its worst economic crisis that left most of the population below the poverty line.

The end of the planned economy meant also that the industrial enterprises would have to buy supplies and sell their goods by themselves, {{and most of the}} management was not prepared for such a change. Moldova undertook a privatisation plan which was effective in the transfer of the ownership of houses to the people. The attempted privatization of production means did not boost the economy as it was desired. International financial institutions, judging the apparent presence of landmarks indicating a modern developed society in 1992, have overestimated the capacity of Moldova's economy and government to withstand the transition to market economy, and imposed the country to open its market to outside goods without implementation of any effective action to support internal production. As a result, Moldova's industry, especially machine building, became all but defunct, and unemployment skyrocketed. The economic fortunes of Moldova began to change in 2001; since then the country has seen a steady annual growth of between 5% and 10%. Early 2000s also saw a considerable growth of emigration of Moldovans looking for work (mostly illegally) in Italy, Portugal, Spain, Greece, Cyprus, Turkey, and other countries, in addition to work in Russia. One of the reasons for this was that in 1991, 1.3 million Moldovans, or ca. 60% of the workforce, were employed in agriculture, which normally does not require such a large number of people. Remittances from Moldovans abroad account for ca. 30% of Moldova's GDP, the largest percentage in Europe.

40|$|It {{has been}} noted {{that there is an}} {{inconsistency}} between Moldova's monetary authorities' declared pursuit of price stability and the de facto exchange rate peg. This paper looks into the exchange rate regime of the <b>Moldovan</b> <b>leu</b> (MDL) aiming to identify the de facto regime, to test whether it can be described by a basket peg (and, if so, to determine the composition of this basket), and whether the regime has been stable over time (and, if not, to detect and date regime shifts). The methodologies used in our analysis include the celebrated Frankel-Wei regression, a Kalman filter algorithm and empirical fluctuation process. We show that MDL generally follows a peg to USD with varying implicit weight and fluctuation bands. The paper is organized as follows. Section 1 provides an insight into the exchange rate regime of Moldova by identifying the main trends and developments in its foreign exchange market. Section 2 reviews the economic literature on exchange rate regime identification. Section 3 describes the data used in the analysis. Section 4 explains the methodologies. Section 5 provides an interpretation of the results obtained. Finally, Section 6 summarizes the main findings. ...|$|E
40|$|As Moldova has {{the purpose}} {{to enter the}} European Union the actual {{situation}} {{in the country is}} analyzed in this article. The article gives the comparative analysis of the basic parameters of Moldova with the other European Union country-members to define the ways of development of the country in the given direction. Since 1994 relations between Moldova and the European Union have developed on an upward trajectory. The dialogue between the two sides officially started that year with the signing of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA), which entered into force in 1998 and provided the basis for cooperation with the EU in political, commercial, economic, legal, cultural fields. EU-Moldova relations have advanced to a higher level in 2009 when the country participated in the Eastern Partnership – an instrument of European policy that favored the signing on 29 May 2013 of the Association Agreement, the document which came to replace previous PCA and that is currently the most important element of the legal framework of Moldova-EU dialogue. But beyond the respective treaties signed, individually, between EU and states that intend to join the European community, {{there are a number of}} fundamental requirements 3 (criteria), which condition the process of European integration of the state with declared intentions of accession. The aim of the research is to analyze to what extent Moldovan economy meet the requirements of economic alignment with EU standards, achieving a comparative analysis of the main relevant macroeconomic indicators. Research methodology. For analysis were used analysis-synthesis method, comparison method and others. Results of the analysis. Part of the criteria analyzed converge with EU requirements, while the most relevant indicators regarding standards of living show reserves show reserves for future improvement, such as the average wage, the lending rate, the exchange rate of the <b>Moldovan</b> <b>Leu</b> against the major international currencies. There are a number of other indicators such as transparency in the banking system administration, territorial conflicts (Transnistria), etc. which are points of incompatibility with the policy of the European Union...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>Moldovan</b> <b>leu</b> {{has been accompanied}} by a monetary stabilization policy that until 1998 proved {{to be one of the}} most successful among FSU countries. The leu showed a remarkable stability and the rate of inflation was brought down to around 10 % in 1997. However, fiscal policy was driven by inertia and pressure groups, reflecting the slow path of structural reforms and the general weakness of the state. Loose fiscal policy in turn reduced the determination in reforming state structures. Arrears and nettingout operations led to the development of the non-payment culture. At macroeconomic level, expansionary fiscal policy led to high absorption in the economy that was not met by the supply side response due to the impeded restructuring process, which fuelled imports and deteriorated trade balance. The ultimate result of the policy mix was the rapid accumulation of external debt and expenditure arrears. The unsustainability of both internal and external position of the state led to the inevitable financial crisis. The turmoil that followed in 1998 the crisis in Russia was a catalyst that speeded up the collapse of monetary stabilization. The capital account losses (capital flight) immediately brought the country to the verge of default. The abrupt and probably persistent loss of major export markets will affect the real economic activity over a longer period. More over, the crisis may create a window opportunity for accelerating Moldovan reforms. A critical situation makes the public and policy makers more likely to accept the painful measures that are necessary to revert the negative tendencies accumulated in recent years, while the large external debt makes the country fully dependent on the co-operation with international organizations, especially the IMF. Indeed, the new cabinet of young and liberal reformers voted in March 1999 initiated a more energetic program of reforms. Likewise, the decline of exports to Russia forced Moldovan enterprises to search new export possibilities for many producers trying to enter non-traditional western markets. The remainder of this paper is organised in the following way. The first chapter describes the {{introduction of}} the national currency and monetary stabilisation observed in Moldova in years 1993 ­ 1997. The second chapter discusses the impact of erroneous fiscal policy on the Moldovan economy in the same period. The third chapter depicts the developments of the crises of 1998 and draws conclusions about possible scenarios for next years. Background information about Moldova is reported in the appendix. Financial Crisis, Moldova...|$|E
40|$|After {{stabilization}} in 1993 Moldova {{maintained an}} unsustainable macroeconomic policy mix. The key problem {{was a lack}} of a fiscal adjustment, which resulted in large budget deficits. At the same time, the National Bank of Moldova (NBM) attempted to conduct a tight monetary policy. As a result, the exchange rate was appreciating, domestic absorption increasingly exceeded income and the country has been running large Current Account deficits. Moldova had an access to international financial markets and its indebtedness vs. {{the rest of the world}} was growing year by year at an alarming rate. Finally, in late 1998 Moldova suffered a balance of payments crisis, directly triggered by developments in Russia. <b>Moldovan</b> <b>leu</b> was devalued by about 70 % and the current account improved. The paper concentrates on the empirical dimension of the Moldovan financial crisis. It provides a case study of a) detecting and interpreting macroeconomic anomalies and b) identification of early warning signals of policy unsustainability and imminent change of financial market sentiment. The first part of the paper discusses domestic macroeconomic developments, which correspond with the current account evolution. It examines determinants of a steady growth of the share of consumption in GDP, and of developments in government and non-government disposable incomes. The turnaround of foreign balance had its counterpart in a significant reduction of the share of consumption and investments in GDP, although, given the economic outlook of Moldova, investments still remained surprisingly high. Macroeconomic anomalies in Moldova have their roots in both the fiscal disequilibrium and a too slow progress in enterprise restructuring. The second part of the paper identifies monetary phenomena generated by macroeconomic imbalances. Initially, the tight monetary policy of the NBM, the resulting stable exchange rate and low inflation contributed to a gradual growth of demand for money and remonetization. However, growing imbalances in the Moldovan economy put sustainability of the exchange rate and price level under question. As a result, demand for lei started to shrink and remonetization reversed itself. Interest rates increased and the NBM foreign reserves started to fall. Because of the uncertainty about the future stability of the leu, people converted much of their deposits into dollars and the dollarization of deposits reached more than 50 %. The case of Moldova illustrates dangers faced by a country, which conducts a loose fiscal policy and relies on foreign capital inflows. Prior to the crisis, many macroeconomic indicators, especially in the monetary sphere, had been judged as appropriate. However, a hard monetary stance only postponed manifestation of problems caused by the fiscal imbalance and lack of structural reforms. Moldova, fiscal imbalance...|$|E
