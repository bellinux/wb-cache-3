40|$|Background Stroke {{mortality}} {{has been}} found to be much higher among residents in the stroke belt region than in the rest of United States, but it is not known whether differences exist in the quality of stroke care provided in Department of Veterans Affairs <b>medical</b> <b>centers</b> in states inside and outside this region. Objective We compared mortality and inpatient stroke care quality between Veterans Affairs <b>medical</b> <b>centers</b> inside and outside the stroke belt region. Methods Study patients were veterans hospitalized for ischemic stroke at 129 Veterans Affairs <b>medical</b> <b>centers.</b> Inpatient stroke care quality was assessed by 14 quality indicators. Multivariable logistic regression models were fit to examine differences in quality between facilities inside and outside the stroke belt, adjusting for patient characteristics and Veterans Affairs <b>medical</b> <b>centers</b> clustering effect. Results Among the 3909 patients, 28 · 1 % received inpatient ischemic stroke care in 28 stroke belt Veterans Affairs <b>medical</b> <b>centers,</b> and 71 · 9 % obtained care in 101 non-stroke belt Veterans Affairs <b>medical</b> <b>centers.</b> Patients cared for in stroke belt Veterans Affairs <b>medical</b> <b>centers</b> were more likely to be younger, Black, married, have a higher stroke severity, and less likely to be ambulatory pre-stroke. We found no statistically significant differences in short- and long-term post-admission mortality and inpatient care quality indicators between the patients cared for in stroke belt and non-stroke belt Veterans Affairs <b>medical</b> <b>centers</b> after risk adjustment. Conclusions These data suggest that a stroke belt does not exist within the Veterans Affairs health care system in terms of either post-admission mortality or inpatient care quality...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the {{efficiency}} performance of the hospitals and <b>medical</b> <b>centers</b> in Vietnam by using a non-parametric approach, namely the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model. The data from the Economic Census for Enterprises by the General Statistics Office of Vietnam (GSO) consists of 44 observations, which include 17 hospitals and 27 <b>medical</b> <b>centers</b> in different provinces and cities in 2002. The results indicate that the average scale efficiency of the hospitals was 77. 4 percent, while that of the <b>medical</b> <b>centers</b> was 58. 7 percent. Further, hospitals were clearly more efficient than <b>medical</b> <b>centers</b> due to some possible factors. Locations in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh city had no influence on either overall technical efficiency or scale efficiency. Despite differences in the results of testing the impact of net capital-labor ratio on efficiency for hospitals and <b>medical</b> <b>centers,</b> these organizations appear to operate in labor-intensive ways. ...|$|R
