40|$|Secret Sharing {{techniques}} {{are now the}} building blocks of several security protocols. A (t;n) threshold secret sharing scheme is one in which t or more participant can join together to retrieve the secret. Traditional single secret sharing schemes are modified and generalized to share multiple secrets. Use of elliptic curve and pairing in secret sharing is gaining more importance. In this paper we propose a threshold <b>multi</b> secret <b>sharing</b> scheme where more than one secret is shared. When the threshold number of participants collate, the multi secret can be retrieved. The scheme make use of elliptic curve and bilinear pairing. Verification of shares by the participants, shares consistency checking, detection and identification of cheaters are the extended capabilities achieved. The shared secrets are retrieved in single stage here, unlike the <b>multi</b> stage secret <b>sharing</b> scheme. The participants can be added very easily. The scheme is efficient and the number of public parameters are also less compared with the existing threshold <b>multi</b> secret <b>sharing</b> scheme based on the elliptic curve. The dealer can easily modify the secret or add additional secret by changing the public parameters of the scheme.

It also separates pathways for communication and control. In order to improve performance, a communication cycle is constructed for synchronizing the WBSN system with the pipeline. A low-power adaptive process is a necessity for long-time healthcare monitoring. It includes a data encoder and an adaptive power conserving algorithm within each sensor node along with an accurate control switch system for adaptive power control. The thermal sensor node consists of a micro control unit (MCU), a thermal bipolar junction transistor sensor, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), a calibrator, a data encoder, a 2. 4 -GHz radio frequency transceiver, and an antenna. When detecting ten body temperature or 240 electrocardiogram (ECG) signals per second, the power consumption is either 106. 3 or 220. 4. By switching circuits, <b>multi</b> <b>sharing</b> wireless protocol, and reducing transmission data by data encoder, it achieves a reduction of 99. 573 % or 99. 164 % in power consumption compared to those without using adaptive and encoding modules.
