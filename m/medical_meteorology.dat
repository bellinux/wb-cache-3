40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} and {{its huge}} computational demands require a close coupling between efficient mathematical methods and their hardware-aware implementation on emerging and highly parallel computing platforms. The paradigm shift towards manycore parallelism not only offers a high potential of computing capabilities but also {{comes up with}} urgent challenges in designing scalable, portable, and flexible software solutions. The latter point {{is closely related to}} adaptation, variation, and restructuring of algorithms and numerical schemes in order to be compliant with coarse- and fine-grained parallelism, hierarchical memory subsystems, heterogeneous platforms, and any kind of communication bottleneck. Numerical codes should not only be efficient and robust, but also future-proof with respect to the current dynamic landscape of hardware platforms and parallel programming environments. The goal of our work is to treat problems with great impact on science and humanities, e. g. in the domain of <b>meteorology,</b> <b>medical</b> engineering and energy research, can be modeled and solved. With efficient preconditioners the bounds of solvability can be pushed further beyond.

40|$|The {{contingency}} table literature on tests for dependence among discrete multi-category vari-ables is extensive. Standard tests assume, however, that draws are independent and only limited results {{exist on the}} e¤ect of serial dependencya problem that is important {{in areas such as}} eco-nomics, 8 ̆ 5 nance, <b>medical</b> trials and <b>meteorology.</b> This paper proposes new tests of independence based on canonical correlations between discretely observed variables. The average canonical cor-relation statistic is shown to be the same as the familiar Pearson 2 statistic in the case of two-way {{contingency table}}s. Dynamically augmented versions of the tests are then proposed that allow for general serial dependencies and do not require the underlying processes to be reversible Markov-ian processes as assumed by Tavare (1983). The proposed tests allow for an arbitrary number of categories as well as multi-way tables of arbitrary dimension, are robust in the presence of serial dependencies and are simple to implement using multivariate regression methods. For three-way or higher order tables we propose new tests of joint and marginal independence. Monte Carlo experiments show that the proposed tests have good 8 ̆ 5 nite sample properties. An empirical appli-cation to survey data on forecasts of GDP growth demonstrates the importance of correcting for serial dependencies in predictability tests...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Electric load {{forecasting}} is {{an important}} research field to increase reliability of power supply and provide optimal load and minimum price scheduling in an intelligent manner. This paper presents the development of advanced neural networks to face successfully {{the problem of the}} short term Electric load forecasting. Artificial neural network (ANN) has been used for many years in various sectors and disciplines like <b>medical,</b> robotics, electronics, <b>meteorology,</b> economy, forecasts, etc. This report present the development of an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) Based short-term load forecasting model which forecast the electric load. It predict electric load by considering these information as input like date, time, humidity and previous data sets taken from the various power corporation. This model is derived by modifying the method of forecasting technique using Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) which is the process of formulating the mapping from a given input to an output using fuzzy logic Fuzzy systems are expert decision making tools that require support from Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for the generation of inference. This leads to the formation of Neuro-Fuzzy Inference system (NFIS) and ANFIS are a class of adaptive networks that are functionally equivalent to fuzzy inference systems. Experimental results show that such system is effective in controlling, managing, planning and organizing the electric load by forecasting the load...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} optimal transport, which {{involves}} finding the most cost-efficient way of transporting mass from one location to another, has been widely-studied, {{going back to}} the late eighteenth century. Recent years have revealed numerous applications in areas such as <b>medical</b> imaging, <b>meteorology,</b> cosmology, oceanography, and economics. Despite the importance of optimal transport, the computation of solutions remains extremely challenging. In the simplest case, where the cost function is quadratic, the problem takes on additional structure. In this setting, the constraint that mass must be conserved can be expressed as a fully non-linear partial differential equation known as the elliptic Monge-Ampere equation. The numerical solution of the Monge-Ampere equation has received {{a great deal of attention}} in recent years, yet the correct and efficient computation of solutions remains a challenge. Because of the nonlinearity of the equation, solutions can be singular and standard numerical approaches can fail. This means that novel solution techniques are needed to correctly capture the behaviour of weak solutions. We describe a monotone finite difference discretisation, which provably converges to the viscosity solution of the Monge-Ampere equation. The accuracy of the discretisation is improved by combining higher-order schemes with the monotone scheme needed to capture the correct behaviour of solutions near singularities. In doing this, we provide a general result about the convergence of higher-order finite difference methods for elliptic equations. The resulting nonlinear equations are solved efficiently using Newton 2 ̆ 7 s method. To ensure that mass is mapped into the desired region, the Monge-Ampere equation must be coupled to a transport boundary condition. This type of boundary condition is non-standard, and previously has been implemented only in very simple cases (such as transporting a square to a square). We propose a new method for implementing the transport condition by solving a sequence of more tractable Monge-Ampere equations with Neumann boundary conditions. To demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the resulting methods, we provide computational results for a number of challenging problems including the recovery of inverse maps, mapping onto unbounded density functions, mapping from a disconnected domain, and mapping onto non-convex sets...|$|R
40|$|Today, {{digital images}} are massively used {{in all kinds}} of applications: entertainment, multimedia, <b>meteorology,</b> <b>medical</b> applications. The quality of the {{acquisition}} device and the conditions in which the image is taken affect the quality of the resulting image in a drastic way. Depending of these factors, the images can be over or underexposed, blurry or noisy. This thesis focuses on the problem of removing the noise from digital images. The developments proposed in this work aim at improving the denoising results of the statistical filters and provide solutions to use them in the specific case of medical images The statistical filters are essentially mode estimators. As mode separation improves in high dimensional spaces, we propose to adapt the statistical filters to use high-dimensional data. As a result, two new types of filters are created: Patch-based filters and patchwise filters. These filters {{turns out to be a}} generalisation of some other patch-based filters proposed in the literature. The statistical filters use the Gaussian kernel as notion of similarity. This kernel is not adapted to the high-dimensional spaces. We propose to use other kernels, constructed in order to avoid the complications linked to the use of high-dimensional data in the statistical filters. In real life applications, such as medical images, the parameters of the filters are chosen in a heuristic way. A new method to model the noise created by a medical scanner is proposed. It estimates the optimal parameters needed to remove the noise from the images taken with that scanner. Some medical images are polluted with a noise that follows a Poisson law. The statistical filters are not designed to filter with this kind of noise. Variance stabilizing transforms are used in order to change the noise on the image to Gaussian noise, and then apply the statistical filters. An integration of the variance stabilizing transforms into the algorithms is proposed. (FSA 3) [...] UCL, 201...|$|R
