The DMSR, as carried into the IMSR design, proposed to use molten salt fuel and graphite moderator in a simplified converter design using LEU (in combination with thorium, which {{may be used in}} the IMSR), with periodic additions of LEU fuel. Most previous proposals for molten salt reactors all bred more fuel than needed to operate, so were called breeders. Converter or [...] "burner" [...] reactors like the IMSR and DMSR can also utilize plutonium from existing spent fuel as their <b>makeup</b> <b>fuel</b> source. The more recent SmAHTR proposal was for a small, modular, molten salt cooled but solid TRISO fuelled reactor.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this report was performed under {{a grant from the}} U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) to describe and compare the merits of two advanced alternative nuclear fuel cycles [...] named by this study as the “UREX+ 3 c fuel cycle” and the “Alternative Fuel Cycle” (AFC). Both fuel cycles were assumed to support 100 1, 000 MWe light water reactor (LWR) nuclear power plants operating over the period 2020 through 2100, and the fast reactors (FRs) necessary to burn the plutonium and minor actinides generated by the LWRs. Reprocessing in both fuel cycles is assumed {{to be based on the}} UREX+ 3 c process reported in earlier work by the DOE. Conceptually, the UREX+ 3 c process provides nearly complete separation of the various components of spent nuclear fuel in order to enable recycle of reusable nuclear materials, and the storage, conversion, transmutation and/or disposal of other recovered components. Output of the process contains substantially all of the plutonium, which is recovered as a 5 : 1 uranium/plutonium mixture, in order to discourage plutonium diversion. Mixed oxide (MOX) fuel for recycle in LWRs is made using this 5 : 1 U/Pu mixture plus appropriate makeup uranium. A second process output contains all of the recovered uranium except the uranium in the 5 : 1 U/Pu mixture. The several other process outputs are various waste streams, including a stream of minor actinides that are stored until they are consumed in future FRs. For this study, the UREX+ 3 c fuel cycle is assumed to recycle only the 5 : 1 U/Pu mixture to be used in LWR MOX fuel and to use depleted uranium (tails) for the <b>makeup</b> uranium. This <b>fuel</b> cycle is assumed not to use the recovered uranium output stream but to discard it instead. On the other hand, the AFC is assumed to recycle both the 5 : 1 U/Pu mixture and all of the recovered uranium. In this case, the recovered uranium is reenriched with the level of enrichment being determined by the amount of recovered plutonium and the combined amount of the resulting MOX. The study considered two sub-cases within each of the two fuel cycles in which the uranium and plutonium from the first generation of MOX spent fuel (i) would not be recycled to produce a second generation of MOX for use in LWRs or (ii) would be recycled to produce a second generation of MOX fuel for use in LWRs. The study also investigated the effects of recycling MOX spent fuel multiple times in LWRs. The study assumed that both fuel cycles would store and then reprocess spent MOX fuel that is not recycled to produce a next generation of LWR MOX fuel and would use the recovered products to produce FR fuel. The study further assumed that FRs would begin to be brought on-line in 2043, eleven years after recycle begins in LWRs, when products from 5 -year cooled spent MOX fuel would be available. Fuel for the FRs would be made using the uranium, plutonium, and minor actinides recovered from MOX. For the cases where LWR fuel was assumed to be recycled one time, the 1 st generation of MOX spent fuel was used to provide nuclear materials for production of FR fuel. For the cases where the LWR fuel was assumed to be recycled two times, the 2 nd generation of MOX spent fuel was used to provide nuclear materials for production of FR fuel. The number of FRs in operation was assumed to increase in successive years until the rate that actinides were recovered from permanently discharged spent MOX fuel equaled the rate the actinides were consumed by the operating fleet of FRs. To compare the two fuel cycles, the study analyzed recycle of nuclear fuel in LWRs and FRs and determined the radiological characteristics of irradiated nuclear fuel, nuclear waste products, and recycle nuclear fuels. It also developed a model to simulate the flows of nuclear materials that could occur in the two advanced nuclear fuel cycles over 81 years beginning in 2020 and ending in 2100. Simulations projected the flows of uranium, plutonium, and minor actinides as these nuclear fuel materials were produced and consumed in a fleet of 100 1, 000 MWe LWRs and in FRs. The model also included recycle and reuse of extant inventories of spent LWR fuel. The results of the simulations allowed comparisons of the two fuel cycles from the standpoints of cost, non-proliferation, radiological health, wastes generated, and sustainability. Results of the research also provide insights regarding (i) multiple recycling of uranium and plutonium from spent MOX fuel in LWRs, (ii) costs and benefits of reenriching and reusing uranium from spent LWR fuel; (iii) effects of using uranium, plutonium, and minor actinides from LWR spent fuels to produce fuel for FRs; (iv) net rates of consumption (burning) in FRs of actinide elements produced in LWRs, and (v) ependencies of and interactions among the different systems of an advanced nuclear fuel cycle [...] and the flows of nuclear materials between these systems...|$|R
40|$|Energy balance was {{performed}} on the clinkering process when utilizing oil shale as a source of both raw materials and energy. The balance was also compared with the typical energy requirements for production of Ordinary Portland (OP) Clinker. The use of Jordanian oil shale can reduce energy requirements in production of OP clinker by 15 – 20 %. This reduction is due to two factors: lower clinkering temperature of 1300 – 1350 °C and an appropriate proportion of the proposed raw materials. An additional energy of 1726 kJ/ton clinker, which represents 45 % of the required energy, is needed to achieve the required clinkering temperature. This could be achieved by estimating the amounts of <b>makeup</b> <b>fuel</b> basing on the net calorific value of this fuel...|$|E
40|$|Isotopic {{tailoring}} of the deuterium and tritium density {{profiles in}} fusion reactors {{can lead to}} reduced tritium inventory in plasma facing components and, therefore, improved safety considerations. The isotopic tailoring concept consists of utilizing a tritium-rich pellet source for core fueling and a deuteriumrich gas source for edge fueling. Because of the improved particle confinement associated with the deeper tritium core fueling component, comparable core densities of deuterium and tritium can be maintained even when the edge deuterium fuel source is {{much larger than the}} core tritium fuel source. The fuel composition of the edge and scrape-off plasmas as well as the isotope fractions in plasma facing components reflect the total throughput of all <b>makeup</b> <b>fuel</b> and are therefore deuterium-rich. This innovative fueling concept results in about a factor of two reduction in tritium inventory of the plasma facing components. The higher tritium burn fraction allows a significant reduction in tritium gas flows {{into and out of the}} vacuum vessel and, for fusion reactors, implies lower required tritium breeding ratios...|$|E
40|$|Flywheel {{energy storage}} systems {{which have a}} very good {{potential}} for use in spacecraft are discussed. This system can be superior to alkaline secondary batteries and regenerable fuel cells in most of the areas that are important in spacecraft applications. Of special importance, relative to batteries, are lighter weight, longer cycle and operating life, and high efficiency which minimizes solar array size and the amount of orbital <b>makeup</b> <b>fuel</b> required. Flywheel systems have a long shelf life, give a precise state of charge indication, have modest thermal control needs, are capable of multiple discharges per orbit, have simple ground handling needs, and have characteristics which would be useful for military applications. The major disadvantages of flywheel energy storage systems are that: power is not available during the launch phase without special provisions; and in flight failure of units may force shutdown of good counter rotating units, amplifying the effects of failure and limiting power distribution system options; no inherent emergency power capability unless specifically designed for, and a high level of complexity compared with batteries.

40|$|India is {{building}} a 500 MWe Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor, {{which is scheduled to}} be operational by 2010. India has refused to accept international safeguards on this fa-cility, raising concerns that the plutonium produced in its uranium blankets might be used to make nuclear weapons. Based on neutronics calculations for a detailed three-dimensional model of the reactor, we estimate that up to 140 kg of weapon-grade pluto-nium could be produced with this facility each year. This article shows how India’s large stockpile of separated reactor-grade plutonium from its unsafeguarded spent heavy-water reactor fuel could serve as <b>makeup</b> <b>fuel</b> to allow such diversion of the weapon-grade plutonium from the blankets of the fast breeder reactor. We describe and assess the most plausible refueling strategies for producing weapon-grade plutonium in this way. BACKGROUND On July 18, 2005, U. S. President George W. Bush and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh issued a joint statement, laying the grounds for the resump-tion of full U. S. and international nuclear aid to India. Under this agreement, the United States has amended its own laws and policies on nuclear technology transfer and is seeking changes in international controls on the supply of nuclear fuel and technology so as to allow “full civil nuclear energy cooperatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of flywheel systems for space stations using the Space Operations Center (SOC) {{as a point}} of reference is discussed. Comparisons with batteries and regenerative fuel cells are made. In the flywheel energy storage concept, energy is stored in the form of rotational kinetic energy using a spinning wheel. Energy is extracted from the flywheel using an attached electrical generator; energy is provided to spin the flywheel by a motor, which operates during sunlight using solar array power. The motor and the generator {{may or may not be}} the same device. Flywheel energy storage systems have a very good potential for use in space stations. This system can be superior to alkaline secondary batteries and regenerable fuel cells in most of the areas that are important in spacecraft applications. Of special impotance relative to batteries, are high energy density (lighter weight), longer cycle and operating life, and high efficiency which minimizes the amount of orbital <b>makeup</b> <b>fuel</b> required. In addition, flywheel systems have a long shelf life, give a precise state of charge indication, have modest thermal control needs, are capable of multiple discharges per orbit, have simple ground handling needs, and have the potential for very high discharge rate.

40|$|Abstract: A {{refinery}} {{is essentially}} a joint production process system. Due to the complex nature of the process involved, while it converts heavier oils into high quality oil products, fuels and other high value products, it also provides a way to curb carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions. As refineries are profit-seeking businesses, this paper used linear programming (LP) models {{to assess the impact}} of different taxation amounts on CO 2 emissions on a refinery’s operational configuration, and energy using strategies for a refining expansion project in Taiwan, and to discover what the carbon price should be in order to justify the required changes. The result reveals the necessity of developing processes, such as the Delayed Coking (DCU) process combined with hydrotreating, to produce high-quality fuels and petrochemical products in the refinery. Our findings indicate that this anticipated expansion plan reduced CO 2 emissions by 4. 92 %, while obtaining an efficiency of 14. 46 USD/ton-CO 2 at a cost of 30 USD/ton-CO 2, and by 10. 33 % and 25. 22 % CO 2 emission with efficiency gains of 15. 22 and 78. 61 USD/ton-CO 2 at a cost of 90 and 180 USD/ton-CO 2, respectively. When emission costs are over 90 USD/ton-CO 2, the refinery opts for liquid petroleum gas (LPG) instead of burning fuel oil, since using hydrogen as a <b>makeup</b> <b>fuel</b> only proves beneficial when the CO 2 emission costs are over 150 USD/ton-CO 2...|$|E
