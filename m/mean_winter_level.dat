40|$|At the German Antarctic {{research}} station (709, 8 "W), long-term {{observations of the}} chemical and radio-chemical composition of atmospheric particulate matter were started in spring 1983. Based on the analysis of high-volume aerosol filters sampled continuously for nearly 5 years, concentration records of the following aerosol components are presented here: (a) major ions (sea-salt, sulfate, nitrate); (b) cosmogenic 7 Be and terrigeneous 210 Pb; (c) trace elements (crustal Mn, heavy metal Pb). All species mentioned, {{with the exception of}} stable and radioactive Pb, show annual cycles. The maximum occurs in austral summer for 7 Be, sulfate, and crustal Mn. For sea-salt, however, the maximum is found in local autumn, and for nitrate in local spring. In local summer, the enhanced 'Be to 210 Pb ratio is attributed to intenser large scale vertical mixing. The pattern of total sulfate seems to be controlled by the nss-sulfate production from marine organo-sulfur species during local summer, whereas in polar night, nss-sulfate shows very low or even negative concentration. Crustal aerosol (indicated by Mn) shows a mean summer contribution of 16 ng/SCM which exceeds the <b>mean</b> <b>winter</b> <b>level</b> by more than a factor of two. Based on a mean wash-out ratio of 0. 27. 106 observed for 210 Pb bearing aerosol particles, a Pb snow concentration of 3. 0 pg/g is deduced from the mean air concentration of 11 pg/SCM. 1...|$|E

Areas of less ice appeared in the winters of 1995 / 96 and 1996 / 97,during which ice cover was 75 % and 69 %, respectively, of the maximum ice area (1. 25 × 10 ^ 6 km^ 2) {{in the winter of}} 1997 / 98. The ice volumes in the winters of 1995 / 96 and 1996 / 97 decreased by as much as 58 % and 56 %, respectively, of the maximum ice volume (5. 5 × 10 ^ 2 km^ 3) in 1994 / 95. Furthermore, the mean ice thickness, calculated by dividing the ice volume by ice area of the whole Okhotsk Sea, was thinner in winters when the ice area was small. The ice volume was correlated with cold air conditions, especially off the northeast coast of Kamchatka, where air temperature is affected greatly by the Aleutian low.

40|$|Background: More than 90 % {{of vitamin}} D {{synthesis}} {{is dependent on}} UV exposure. Photosensitive disorders such as lupus erythematosus, protoporphyria and xeroderma require strict sun avoidance, and vitamin D deficiency has been demonstrated in these patients. Melanoma patients are also instructed to avoid sun exposure and may hence {{be expected to be}} vitamin D deficient. Materials and method : Winter and summer vitamin D levels were compared in a group of melanoma patients (n= 61) and age- and phototype-matched controls (n= 53) without photosensitive disorders. Results : Oral supplementary vitamin D intake was reported in 32. 7 % of the melanoma patients and in 15. 1 % in the control group. Despite oral supplementation, only 25 % of the melanoma patients and the controls presented with vitamin D levels of 30 ng/mL or higher. In non-supplemented subjects in the melanoma and control groups, respectively, <b>mean</b> <b>winter</b> vitamin D <b>levels</b> were below the recommended threshold at 12, 6 ng/mL vs 13. 2 ng/mL, respectively, but not statistically different. These values increased significantly in both groups during the summer to 24. 6 and 23. 8 ng/mL respectively. Conclusion: Unexpected, significant increases in vitamin D levels were seen in melanoma patients during summer, suggesting non-adherence with photoprotective measures and reflecting a heliophilic behaviour. Vitamin D supplementation is recommended in melanoma patients during both winter and summer. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Summary A {{seasonal}} {{variation in the}} month of initial detection of breast cancer has been previously observed in pre-menopausal women, and it has been proposed that {{this may be due to}} cyclic changes in tumour growth mediated by the effects of melatonin on ovarian function. To investigate this possibility serum melatonin concentrations have been measured every 2 h for 24 h at the summer and winter solstice in 20 pre-menopausal women with previous breast cancer and nine controls. Twelve women had detected their tumour in winter and eight in summer. Overall melatonin secretion assessed by either amplitude of the noctural melatonin pulse or the area under the 24 h melatonin curve (AUC) was not different between breast cancer women or controls. However, the amplitude and AUC fell in winter in breast cancer patients (summer to winter 93. 6 to 77. 5 pg ml 1, P< 0. 002 and 743 to 634 AUC units, P< 0. 005 for amplitude and AUC respectively), whereas the winter minus summer values were significantly positive in controls compared with cancer patients. The abnormal fall in winter values in the women with previous breast cancer was confined to the group of women who had been <b>winter</b> detectors (<b>mean</b> summer to <b>winter</b> <b>levels</b> 94. 9 to 72. 6 pg ml-, P< 0. 01 and 775 to 637 AUC units, P< 0. 05 for amplitude and AUC respectively) whereas there was no significant seasonal alteration in these measurements in summer detectors.

40|$|Air {{pollution}} {{is a well}} known public health problem that involves both long-term and acute effects. An outcome associated with traffic-related air {{pollution is}} respiratory illness. Many studies have described the relationship between asthmatic symptoms and traffic-related air pollution; however, few have investigated the potential of air pollution to cause asthma itself, especially among adults. The overall aim of this thesis was to study the relationship between vehicle exhaust levels at home and the prevalence of self-reported annoyance and asthmatic symptoms, and the incidence of asthma and rhinitis. These relationships were evaluated using different indicators of exposure with a high spatial resolution. Three different data sets {{were used for the}} four papers included in this thesis. The first paper (paper I) is based on a questionnaire that was sent to a random selection of the adult population within three Swedish cities (Gothenburg, Uppsala, and Umeå) as part of the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency’s health-related environmental monitoring. The aim was to study the degree of self-reported annoyance and the prevalence of asthmatic symptoms in relation to the levels of vehicle exhaust outside the home. The level of exposure was described using modeled levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) as the exposure indicator. The second paper (paper II) is based on new asthma cases identified within the Obstructive Lung disease In Northern Sweden (OLIN) study, each with a matched referent. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze if new cases of asthma had higher levels of vehicle exhaust outside the home compared to the population controls. Exposure was assessed using both measured levels of NO 2 outside each home, and by summarizing the amount of traffic within a 200 metre buffer surrounding each participant’s home. Papers III and IV were based on the Respiratory Health in Northern Europe (RHINE) Cohort, a prospective cohort of adults included in 1990 and followed up with in 1999. The proportion of new cases of asthma (papers III and IV) and rhinitis (paper IV) were identified based on the answers from the initial and follow-up questionnaires. In paper III, exposure was assessed by using meteorological dispersion models to calculate the levels of NO 2 outside each home as an indicator of the levels of vehicle exhaust. As an alternative indicator, the distance from each participant’s home to the nearest major road was calculated using geographical information system (GIS) tools. The exposure assessment in paper IV was also based on meteorological dispersion models, but expressed the levels of vehicle exhaust as particle mass concentration. The results show that the levels of vehicle exhaust outside the home are significantly correlated with the degree of self-reported annoyance and the prevalence of asthmatic symptoms, and also with the risk of developing asthma, but not rhinitis, among adults. The odds ratio (OR) for high annoyance to vehicle exhaust and reporting asthmatic symptoms was 1. 14 (95 % Confidence Interval, CI 1. 11 - 1. 18) and 1. 04 (95 % CI 1. 01 - 1. 07) per 1 µg/m 3 increase in the NO 2 level outside the home, respectively. Paper II showed there was a non-significant tendency for increased risk of developing asthma among those living with high levels of vehicle exhaust outside their home. This finding was then supported by papers III and IV, showing a significant relationship between the onset of asthma and the <b>mean</b> (<b>winter)</b> <b>levels</b> of NO 2 outside the home (OR= 1. 46, 95 % CI 1. 07 - 1. 99 per 10 µg/m 3) and the levels of vehicle exhaust particles outside the home. In paper III, living close to a major road was significantly related to the risk of developing asthma. No significant results were shown between vehicle exhaust and rhinitis. In conclusion, vehicle exhaust outside the home is associated with the prevalence of annoyance and asthmatic symptoms, and with the risk of developing asthma, but not rhinitis, among adults...|$|R

40|$|Many {{time series}} exhibit non-stationary {{behaviour}} {{that can be}} explained by intermittent coupling between the observed system and one or more unobserved drivers. We develop Bayesian state space methods for modelling changes to the mean level or temporal correlation structure due to intermittent coupling. Improved system diagnostics and prediction are achieved by incorporating expert knowledge for both the observed and driver processes. Time-varying autoregressive residual processes are developed to model changes in the temporal correlation structure. Efficient filtering and smoothing methods are proposed for the resulting class of models. We for evaluating the evidence of unobserved drivers, and for quantifying their overall effect, and their effects during individual events. Methods for evaluating the potential for skilful predictions within coupled periods, and in future coupled periods, are also proposed.

The central Red Sea (Jeddah area) is {{therefore}} almost tideless, and as such the annual water level changes are more significant.

40|$|Long-term {{intensity}} {{changes in}} the winter synoptic activity over the North Atlantic are studied in relation to changes of the <b>winter</b> <b>mean</b> sea <b>level</b> pressure (SLP) fields. Analysis of linear trends has revealed a good agreement between long-term (interdecadal) {{changes in the}} intensity of synoptic processes and variations of the winter SLP. On the contrary, no such agreement was found between detrended and low-pass filtered anomalies. There are periods, that are characterised by the enhanced (reduced) synoptic activity attributed to the low (high) index of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). It appears that low-passed anomalies of intramonthly root mean square deviations (RMSD) of SLP are negatively correlated with NAO and East Atlantic (EA) teleconnection patterns {{over most of the}} North Atlantic. The low-passed winter SLP anomalies demonstrate both propagating and standing patterns. The latter have a period of about 8 years. While meridional dipole-like structures formed by the winter SLP anomalies are shifted to the west (east) of the North Atlantic, the related anomalies of synoptic activity tend to be located in the eastern (western) part of the region. When decadally averaged, anomalies in the intensity of synoptic activity are strongly linked to the North Atlantic storm track position. The exception is the 1980 – 1990 decade, characterised by a very high NAO index. During this decade, enhanced synoptic activity is observed to the south of the North Atlantic storm track.

40|$|Wave {{characteristic}} {{assessments of}} wave energy test sites provide {{a greater understanding}} of prevailing wave conditions and are therefore extremely important to both wave energy test site operators and clients as they can inform wave energy converter design, optimisation, deployment, operation and maintenance. This research presents an assessment of the wave resource at the Atlantic Marine Energy Test Site (AMETS) on the west coast of Ireland based on 12 -years of modelled data from January 2004 to December 2015. The primary aim is to provide an assessment of annual and seasonal wave characteristics and resource variability at the two deployment berths which comprise the site. A nested model has been developed using Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) to replicate wave propagations from regional to local scale with a 0. 05 ° resolution model covering the northeast Atlantic and a 0. 0027 ° resolution model covering AMETS. The coarse and fine models have been extensively validated against available measured data within Irish waters. 12 -year model outputs from the high resolution model were analysed to determine mean and maximum conditions and operational, high and extreme event conditions for significant wave height, energy period and power. Annual and seasonal analyses are presented. The 12 -year annual mean P were 68 kW/m at Berth A (BA) and 57 kW/m at Berth B (BB).
