5|$|Sunday's {{popularity}} waned after World War I, {{when many}} people in his revival audiences were attracted to radio broadcasts and <b>moving</b> <b>pictures</b> instead.

50|$|There was a {{time when}} it was the popular thing to {{denounce}} the <b>moving</b> <b>picture</b> show, but today, with the extraordinary development of motion pictures it has become a real fashion. There is no amusement that attracts the people to such an extent as the <b>moving</b> <b>picture</b> show. It appeals directly to the imagination because of the many times real worth represents itself to a great number of wage earners and their families. More than fifty per cent of the entire theater going people are found in the <b>moving</b> <b>picture</b> shows. It attracts thousands who never go to the dramatic theater and affords opportunities for education.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to her column, Michelena wrote occasional articles intended for a wider readership. She wrote in October 1916 {{about the history of}} the moving picture industry in a multiple-article series, beginning her account with a retelling of Eadweard Muybridge's action photograph of Governor Leland Stanford's racehorse named Occident. She defined this high-speed image as essential to the development of <b>moving</b> <b>pictures.</b>|$|E

5|$|Video {{fluoroscopy}} uses {{x-ray radiation}} to produce <b>moving</b> <b>pictures</b> {{of the mouth}} during articulation or swallowing. It is considered the gold standard in studies of dysphagia because {{of its ability to}} take videos of the entire digestive tract during swallowing events. It is often used to study and treat aspiration of food, what parts of the digestive tract are malfunctioning during swallowing, and positions in which swallowing is easiest. Only limited data is able to be collected as sessions are typically limited to three minutes due to the hazards of radiation exposure. and it does not allow for fine grain analysis of tongue movements.|$|E
5|$|Lions {{continue}} to be featured in modern literature, from the messianic Aslan in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and following books from The Chronicles of Narnia series written by C. S. Lewis, to the comedic Cowardly Lion in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The advent of <b>moving</b> <b>pictures</b> saw the continued presence of lion symbolism; {{one of the most}} iconic and widely recognised lions is Leo the Lion, which has been the mascot for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) studios since the 1920s. The 1960s saw the appearance of what is possibly the most famous lioness, the Kenyan animal Elsa in the movie Born Free, based on the true-life book of the same title. The lion's role as king of the beasts has been used in cartoons, such as the 1994 Disney animated feature film The Lion King.|$|E
5|$|Mooppanar, {{a wealthy}} {{landowner}} based in Thanjavur, had purchased a Williamson 35 mm {{camera and a}} printer in England. R. Nataraja Mudaliar, then an automobile dealer in Madras, bought the equipment from him at a price of less than 2,000. Nataraja Mudaliar developed a passion for <b>moving</b> <b>pictures</b> after watching the films of Dadasaheb Phalke. During the administration of Lord Curzon as Viceroy of India from 1899 to 1905, cinematographers from Britain were filming a documentary on him. Nataraja Mudaliar met Stewart Smith, one of the cinematographers {{who worked in the}} documentary, and learned about the basics of photography in film-making through him. This eventually led to Nataraja Mudaliar establishing his production house, India Film Company. He brought together some of his business associates, who invested in the production house, and established South India's first film studio in 1915 on Miller's Road, Purasawalkam, Madras.|$|E

5|$|On 25 March 1925, John Logie Baird {{was able}} to {{demonstrate}} the transmission of <b>moving</b> <b>pictures</b> at the London department store Selfridges. Baird's device relied upon the Nipkow disk and thus {{became known as the}} mechanical television. It formed the basis of experimental broadcasts done by the British Broadcasting Corporation beginning 30 September 1929. However, for most of the twentieth century televisions depended upon the cathode ray tube invented by Karl Braun. The first version of such a television to show promise was produced by Philo Farnsworth and demonstrated to his family on 7 September 1927. After World War II, the experiments in television that had been interrupted were resumed, and it also became an important home entertainment broadcast medium.|$|E
5|$|The opening {{years of}} the 1980s saw a number of changes in {{personnel}} and direction of established hard rock acts, including the deaths of Bon Scott, the lead singer of AC/DC, and John Bonham, drummer with Led Zeppelin. Whereas Zeppelin broke up almost immediately afterwards, AC/DC pressed on, recording the album Back in Black (1980) with their new lead singer, Brian Johnson. It became the fifth-highest-selling album of all time in the US and the second-highest-selling album in the world. Black Sabbath had split with original singer Ozzy Osbourne in 1979 and replaced him with Ronnie James Dio, formerly of Rainbow, giving the band a new sound and a period of creativity and popularity beginning with Heaven and Hell (1980). Osbourne embarked on a solo career with Blizzard of Ozz (1980), featuring American guitarist Randy Rhoads. Some bands, such as Queen, moved away from their hard rock roots and more towards pop rock, while others, including Rush with <b>Moving</b> <b>Pictures</b> (1981), began {{to return to a}} hard rock sound. The creation of thrash metal, which mixed heavy metal with elements of hardcore punk from about 1982, particularly by Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth and Slayer, helped to create extreme metal and further remove the style from hard rock, although a number of these bands or their members would continue to record some songs closer to a hard rock sound. Kiss moved away from their hard rock roots toward pop metal: firstly removing their makeup in 1983 for their Lick It Up album, and then adopting the visual and sound of glam metal for their 1984 release, Animalize, both of which marked a return to commercial success. Pat Benatar {{was one of the first}} women to achieve commercial success in hard rock, with three successive Top 5 albums between 1980 and 1982.|$|E

25|$|As {{technology}} improved, so {{also did}} {{the kinds of}} innovative performances Tibbits {{was able to put}} on stage. Such obscure technologies as cinematoscopes and luminere cinematographs offered the promise of displaying <b>moving</b> <b>pictures.</b> Kleine's Lumiere Cinematograph promised families the chance to see their sons in the Spanish–American War march toward the camera. Thomas Edison's Magniscope never reached Coldwater because it exploded en route, but his Animotoscope did. Eventually the Lyman H. Howe Company offered genuine <b>moving</b> <b>pictures</b> with its Vivograph Graphophone, which depicted a train ride through the Rocy Mountain's Frazer River Canyon. While such technologies had much to be desired in terms of quality, they were nonetheless important steps in the march toward the modern cinema.|$|E
