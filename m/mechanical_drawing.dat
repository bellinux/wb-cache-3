40|$|Subject of investigation: {{mechanical}} engineering drawings. Purpose of the work: {{development of a}} method of analysis of a <b>mechanical</b> engineering <b>drawing</b> for discriminating errors in the construction and in {{the accuracy of the}} sense as well as for selecting a possible strategy of correction of the found errors. A method is developed for the automatic analysis of a <b>mechanical</b> engineering <b>drawing</b> which makes it possible to extend the capabilities of a computer system for the search and correction of various errors. The results of the work include the development of methods for the information processing and development of a program package of a graphics editor for assigning sketches and programs for the semantic analysis of the <b>mechanical</b> engineering <b>drawing.</b> The results are used in the production activities (some enterprises of Udmurtia) and in the training processAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
50|$|A {{drawing table}} is also {{sometimes}} called a mechanical desk because, for several centuries, most <b>mechanical</b> desks were <b>drawing</b> tables. Unlike the gadgety mechanical desks {{of the second}} part of the 18th century, however, the <b>mechanical</b> parts of <b>drawing</b> tables were usually limited to notches, ratchets, and perhaps a few simple gears, or levers or cogs to elevate and incline the working surface.|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{devices such}} as {{linkages}} for drawing curves are known already from Ancient Greece. Later linkages found use in different mechanical devices and machines like {{we can see it}} in 13 th century drawings by Honnecourt or in 16 th century machine drawings by Agricola. In 17 th century Descartes accepted only those curves that had a <b>mechanical</b> device to <b>draw</b> them. <b>Mechanical</b> curve <b>drawing</b> devices later became incorporated into different machine design.

25|$|Dr. Lee D. McCaskill, the {{appointed}} principal in 1992, served for 14 years, during which Tech saw {{the installation of}} more computer classrooms and the switch from the traditional <b>mechanical</b> <b>drawing</b> by hand to teaching the use of computer-aided design programs. McCaskill also presided over the elimination of long-standing hallmark academic concentrations at Tech such as aerospace engineering.|$|E
25|$|A shy child, Stewart {{spent much}} of his after-school time in the {{basement}} working on model airplanes, <b>mechanical</b> <b>drawing</b> and chemistry—all with a dream of going into aviation. It was a dream greatly enhanced by the legendary 1927 flight of Charles Lindbergh, whose progress 19-year-old Stewart, then stricken with scarlet fever, was himself avidly following from home; thus foreshadowing his starring movie role as Lindbergh 30 years later.|$|E

25|$|In 1963, {{the modern}} 1600s wing was added. The school {{underwent}} a renovation in 1976, which added the field house, cafeteria, library and some classrooms nearby. In 1975, the vocational high school closed {{because of the}} opening of Cape Cod Regional Technical High School in Harwich.

25|$|Some of the {{available}} entertainment at the YMCA included camera club with a darkroom, bowling, checkers, chess, dominoes, shuffleboard and other small games, a reading room, calisthenics, volleyball, handball, indoor baseball, basketball, fencing, Spanish class, mathematics, <b>mechanical</b> <b>drawing,</b> Bible class, minstrel shows, boxing smokers, dramatic clubs, literary clubs, debate clubs, glee clubs, orchestras, lectures, excursions, and activities for boys and ladies.

25|$|Kevlar is {{synthesized}} in solution {{from the}} monomers 1,4-phenylene-diamine (para-phenylenediamine) and terephthaloyl chloride in a condensation reaction yielding hydrochloric acid as a byproduct. The result has liquid-crystalline behavior, and <b>mechanical</b> <b>drawing</b> orients the polymer chains in the fiber's direction. Hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) was the solvent initially {{used for the}} polymerization, but for safety reasons, DuPont replaced it by a solution of N-methyl-pyrrolidone and calcium chloride. As this process had been patented by Akzo (see above) {{in the production of}} Twaron, a patent war ensued.|$|E
5000|$|The game is {{presided over}} by a caller, {{whose job it is}} to call out the numbers and {{validate}} winning tickets. They will announce the prize or prizes for each game before starting. The caller will then usually say [...] "Eyes down" [...] to indicate that he is about to start. They then begin to call numbers as they are randomly selected, either by an electronic random number generator (RNG), by drawing counters from a bag or by using balls in a <b>mechanical</b> <b>draw</b> machine. Calling may take the format of simple repetition in the framework, [...] "Both the fives, fifty five", or [...] "Two and three, twenty three", but some numbers have special calls due to their significance. In some independent clubs, numbers ending in a zero are described as 'blind'. So for example, thirty would be called as 'three-o blind 30' The use of blind numbers is generally restricted to independent bingo clubs, as it is not common practice in either of the largest chains of bingo club operators, Gala and Mecca bingo.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} of education within the College received a further boost in 1925 when training was {{offered in the}} Queensland University Diploma in <b>Mechanical</b> and Electrical <b>drawing</b> (continuing on a curriculum tradition established by the Rockhampton School of Arts).|$|R

25|$|Public {{vocational}} {{education and training}} in Sydney is run by TAFE New South Wales and began {{with the opening of}} the Sydney Technical College in 1878. It offered courses in areas such as <b>mechanical</b> <b>drawing,</b> applied mathematics, steam engines, simple surgery, and English grammar. The college became the Sydney Institute in 1992 and now operates alongside its sister TAFE facilities across the Sydney metropolitan area, namely the Northern Sydney Institute, the Western Sydney Institute, and the South Western Sydney Institute.

He worked forty hours a week in the laboratory and classroom and earned $100 a month, enabling him to continue his studies.|$|E
25|$|At Edinburgh, major figures {{included}} David Brewster (1781–1868), {{who made}} {{contributions to the}} science of optics and {{to the development of}} photography. Fleeming Jenkin (1833–85) was the first professor of engineering at the university and among wide interests helped develop ocean telegraphs and <b>mechanical</b> <b>drawing.</b> In medicine Joseph Lister (1827–1912) and his student William Macewen (1848–1924), pioneered antiseptic surgery. The University of Edinburgh was also a major supplier of surgeons for the Royal Navy, and Robert Jameson (1774–1854), Professor of Natural History at Edinburgh, ensured {{that a large number of}} these were surgeon-naturalists, who were vital in the Humboldtian and imperial enterprise of investigating nature throughout the world. Major figures to emerge from Scottish universities in the science of humanity included the philosopher Edward Caird (1835–1908), the anthropologist James George Frazer (1854–1941) and the sociologist and urban planner Patrick Geddes (1854–1932).|$|E
5000|$|He {{was also}} very proud of his {{solution}} for Doubling the Cube. His motivation was {{that he wanted to}} produce catapults. Eratosthenes constructed a <b>mechanical</b> line <b>drawing</b> device to calculate the cube, called the mesolabio.

Archimedes was Eratosthenes' friend and he, too, worked on the war instrument with mathematics. Archimedes dedicated his book The Method to Eratosthenes, knowing his love for learning and mathematics.|$|R
