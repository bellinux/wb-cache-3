5000|$|Initially, Hammond had Cohen work up guitar {{parts for}} [...] "Master Song" [...] and [...] "Sisters of Mercy" [...] with jazz bassist Willie Ruff, and then brought {{in some of}} New York's top session musicians to join them, a move that made Cohen nervous; as biographer Anthony Reynolds observes in his book Leonard Cohen: A Remarkable Life, the dynamic between Cohen and Ruff had been {{intimate}} and natural but [...] "the arrival of more anonymous personnel unnerved Cohen, the studio novice put off by their proficiency." [...] Cohen did ask that a full-length mirror {{be brought into the}} studio because, as he explained to Mojo in November 2001, [...] "through some version of narcissism, I always used to play in front of a mirror.

[...] After Hammond dropped out of the sessions, John Simon took over as producer and, by all accounts, Simon and Cohen clashed over instrumentation and mixing; Cohen wanted the album to have a sparse sound, while Simon felt the songs could benefit from arrangements that included strings and horns. Writing for Mojo in 2012, Sylvie Simmons recalls, [...] "When Leonard heard the result, he was not happy; the orchestration on 'Suzanne' was overblown, while everything about 'Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye' felt too soft. Several tracks had too much bottom, and there were even drums; Leonard had clearly stipulated no drums." [...] The singer and producer also quarreled over a slight stop in the middle of [...] "So Long, Marianne," [...] - a device Cohen felt interrupted the song.

The race marked {{the second time in}} under a month that American Pharoah, {{training}} with Baffert in California, had flown across the country, raising concerns that the extensive air travel was taking a toll on the horse. [...] The only previous Triple Crown winner to win the Travers was Whirlaway in 1941, and two others, Gallant Fox and Affirmed, had been defeated there, helping give the track its nickname [...] "Graveyard of Champions". Baffert had one Travers win (in 2001 with Point Given) in five previous attempts.

[...] —Bob Baffert American Pharoah faced a field of 10 horses, most of whom, including Keen Ice, he had previously defeated. [...] Espinoza had concerns at the starting gate when he noticed that his mount was already sweating, even though the weather was not particularly hot. [...] While the horse led for much of the race, he was hard-pressed throughout by Frosted, a change from Frosted's previous stalking style, attributed to a rider change less than an hour before the race, when Jose Lezcano replaced an injured Joel Rosario, altering the [...] "complexion" [...] of the race. The unexpected tactics of Lezcano may have been decisive. Espinoza stated that he [...] "knew he was in trouble" [...] by the half-mile pole because American Pharoah did not pull away from his rival and lacked his usual energy. Frosted challenged American Pharoah for the lead at the far turn, and the horses bumped several times, but American Pharoah dug in and fought back when Frosted took a very brief lead. While American Pharoah fended off the challenge from Frosted, Keen Ice was coming up on the outside, also under a new jockey, Javier Castellano. They overtook American Pharoah at the sixteenth pole, going on to defeat him by three-quarters of a length. Once again the Saratoga track lived up to its reputation.After the race, Espinoza said, [...] "He's OK ... <b>Maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a little too much for him those three weeks, flying back and forth.

40|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> {{shown that}} Uffink’s attempt {{to protect the}} {{interpretation}} of the wave function against protective measurements fails due to several errors in his arguments. This comment is motivated by a recent review of my manuscript “Protec-tive Measurement and the Meaning of the Wave Function ” (Gao 2011 a). The reviewer said, “the manuscript fails to deal with the most important of such objections, i. e. J. Uffink in Phys. Rev. A 60 : 3474 - 3481 (1999), a paper that argues against AAV that the concept of protective measurements has no implication for {{the interpretation of the}} wave function. ” A critical analysis of Uffink’s objection may be indeed necessary, as no answers have been given by the proponents of protective measurements 1. Vaidman (2009) regarded this ob-jection as a misunderstanding, but he gave no concrete rebuttal. <b>Maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> this objection that made most (?) people blind to the important implica-tions of protective measurements for the interpretation of the wave function. In this comment, I will analyze Uffink’s objection to protective measurements in detail. The main claim of Uffink’s paper is that only observables that commute with the system’s Hamiltonian can be protectively measured (Uffink 1999). Based on this claim, he argued that protective measurements have no implications for the interpretation of the wave function, and the coherence of alternative interpretations of quantum mechanics can be saved. Uffink gave a strict proof of this claim in Section IV of his paper. However, there is a deadly error in the proof concerning the two equations between Eq. (23) and Eq. (24) (in the eprint between Eq. (24) and Eq. (25)) ...|$|R

40|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> {{surprising}} {{that there is}} a young academic in 2015 working intensively on the German philosopher and linguist Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767 - 1835) and his concept of Bildung. In times where – as the author states herself – educational systems globally tend to follow neoliberal principles and where the visibility, commodification, and instrumentalization of knowledge produce a “culture of performativity” (Masschelein & Simons, 2006, p. 19) within a so-called knowledge society, Humboldt’s ideas about Bildung seem very far away from the current mainstream thinking and policy making. But <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> because of this current dominance of neoliberalism in education that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> worth remembering a philosopher and linguist who developed a neo-humanistic concept of Bildung which emphasizes a process of holistic growth, self-realization of the individual as an entirety, freedom, and self-understanding as well as a sense of social responsibility, and which puts the development of the individual’s unique potential and self at the center of educational processes. In her paper the author not only analyses Humboldt’s philosophical concept of Bildung itself but traces the process of its institutionalization in which Humboldt himself, having become a Secretary of Education under Frederick III, was actively involved. Heidt analyses how the concept of Bildung lost the impetus of freedom and autonomous agency and became an instrument for selection and an agent for social and cultural reproduction, discipline, and control. Today’s concept of Bildung is very much – according to Heidt – influenced by neoliberal thinking and so much altered as to become hardly recognizable. For Heidt, Bildung – similar to Humboldt’s concept {{but at the same time}} radically transformed – can only be found outside of educational institutions, e. g., in social networks or street art in cosmopolitan big cities. Bildung, according to the author’s main hypothesis, paradoxically no longer takes place in globally stratified educational institutions, but in a kind of alternative counter world and very much through the medium of language...|$|R

I have invariably found the attempts that I have come across are, at best, unsatisfactory and, at worst, specious.

The idea that he and David Hockney had come up with, was to organize an exhibition of drawings that people who were not practising artists produced and used during their work. This was not be an exhibition of art by people who paint or draw as a sideline or hobby, but an exhibition of artwork in particular, drawings that had {{played a crucial role in}} their work. In the case of scientists, their drawings made by hand rather than by computer, and which had formed part of the research process. In response to this initiative, I collected together some drawings made during the period 1985 to 1987 when the field of Fullerene Science was born. ...|$|R

Meyer and the city hospital board are planning to set up tents near the City hospital, and to heat them if necessary for use. • In addition, there are plans to use either Elmwood Music hall or Broadway auditorium if necessary. • Volunteers from the Kiwanis club assisted in several arrests yesterday, leading to 8 salonkeepers being fined. • The Brewers’ exchange was notified of 68 saloonkeepers that may be violating the order, and the exchange set about trying to contact those individuals. • A liquor store man and pool room proprietor were also arrested. • Police reserves have been notified to help catch violators of the order. • A lawyer called Dr. Gram to inform him that the closing order against saloons could not be enforced, to which Dr. Gram replied, “Maybe <b>it</b> isn’t and <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> but <b>just</b> drop into city court and see how they are paying fines. ”• The health dept. received letters yesterday from several cemetery associations that graves could not be dug fast enough. Dr. Gram said he would locate help for this effort, contacting Charities Commissioner Hunt to get help from prisoners. • Mr. Hunt said that 10 out of 40 prisoners in a roadmaking gang were sick, but that he could probably send 10 to work on the graves problem. • Cemetery trustees said they may increase the wages if necessary, but would take it out of their own funds until things returned to normal. • Wedding are not prohibited, but wedding celebrations must be postponed. • Dr. Gram has heard from the health officer of Detroit that the city is beginning to become affected by influenza, and some public areas are being closed. He asked Dr. Gram what the results had been of closing measures. • Dr. Gram warned the public against becoming “too sanguine,” making sure not to relax any measures just because it seems like the epidemic is letting up. • He stresses the importance of masks again and again, and gives the example of one establishment that, if an employee becomes sick and does not wear a mask, that employee will not be paid while s/he is sick.

Događa se da govorimo o istim stvarima, samo jezikom današnjega vremena. U biti ostaje za sve isto iskustvo, a to je da je mistika doista iskustvo Neiskustvenoga. Ona živi unutar kršćanstva i izvan njega, bila prihvaćana ili odbacivana. Kršćanska mistika ima svoje temeljne izvore u Sv. pismu, liturgiji i Crkvi. U tom ambijentu ona stvara svoje pojmove i definicije te ujedno njima obogaćuje samo kršćanstvo. Važno je istraživati jezik mistika i proširivati značenje mističnih pojmova i slika. Ekstaza i thanatos idu u mistici neodvojivo zajedno kao i spoznaja i ljubav. Tu se mistika razlikuje od kateheze i teologije. Ovaj članak kroz prikaz i analizu pojmova i definicija mistike neizravno želi nju smjestiti kao našu stvarnost. Raščišćavanje pojmova i definicija vodi k dijalogu. To je njihova jedina svrha i cilj. We can reject mystique {{as a part}} {{of history}} but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> still here, {{presenting}} itself as the present. We can try to define it, seek for its role and its purpose. Mystique will evade all that. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> omnipresent but still undefineable. Presence and elusiveness - one live paradox, not in the theorethical sence of poetic language. Maybe that is its definition, because I do not know what else in this world would pose such a deep paradox as mysticism does. If we were to take that paradox from it, it cannot exist as such anymore. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> really conservative and contemporary, even more than contemporary: <b>it</b> <b>is</b> prophetic. Were we to examine it from either side, as much as we want and on as different fields as we want, we will only find more differences within <b>it.</b> But <b>is</b> not exactly that its richness? The true mystery - mystique. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> even a bigger mystery, so it seems to me, the fact that mysticism connects such different mystical thinkers and such different theorists. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> my primal goal to demonstrate that in this text. I also wanted to emphasize from which sources the mystics of all ages drew inspiration so we can justifiably — and duty-bound — assume it and confront it with some modern newly-composed i. e. New Age tendencies of violent stuffing all into one and equating everything, which is not enriching but degrading everything. Tendencies and a desire for phenomena and, as a consequence, seeking saturation in mystique does not present mystique to a modern man but has quite the opposite effect, creating an even more negative opinion of <b>it.</b> Mystique can <b>be</b> everywhere but not everything can be mystique! Mystique is unstatedness of experience, i. e. the experience of Inexperienceable. When we could fully experience God, the only source and the only foundation of Christian mystique, mystique would cease to exist. But then not even God would be God anymore. Eastern apophatic teology with pseudo-Dionysius Aerophagitus and other church elders demonstrates that. The mystics of Christian East and West gave their own definitions of mystique. I mentioned only some of them: Origen, Gregorius of Nyssa, Evagirius Ponticus, Augustin, pseudo-Dionysius Aerophagitus, John Klimak, Maximus the Confessor, Simon the New Theologian, Bernard, Meister Eckhart, Gregorius Palamas, Ruysbroec, Tauler, Theresa of Avila, John of the Cross, Serafin Sarov. When we speak of phenomena in mystique, then we usually have in mind some phenomenal occurences in which the mystics themselves are not interested. Therefore I did not pause at such occurences, but at that which were important for the mystics themselves. How to express the inexpressable in language? Theology does not have adequate expressions for that. That is why mystics lean towards poetry and by doing so reveal, even unwittingly, the spiritual or the natural mystical thread in art. I want to explain the term of ecstasy in its basic meaning so that it does not stay interpreted only as being a supernatural phenomena, because ex-stasis is exiting from oneself. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> manifested in each leaning towards another, in living everyday life to its fullest. I also wanted to point to »thanatos«. The mystics continually speak of dying (the non-mystics speak only of ecstasy as they see it). Ecstasy and thanatos are two inseparable experiences. We find them in the Holy Scriptures of Old and New Testament. Thanatos as a dark night of the soul was especially referred to by John of the Cross. Mystique does not live from outer emotions and senses. It rouses reason and will. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> an intellectual notion full of love. Notion and love are inseparable in mystique. <b>Maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> (and only) the mystics that have managed to inseparably connect these two aspects of human existence. That is also what I wanted to say in this text. I agree with Dan 2 ̆ 7 s statement referred to in the second edition of Sholem’s book - study about the Jewish kabbala {{as a part of}} mystique, only that I would broaden {{the meaning of the word}} »historian« to include every explorer: »A historian can explore how a certain text was perceived by certain readers in different ages, but he can never claim to have revealed the true, the real intention of the author«. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> exactly that which was the intention of my text from the very beginning. Besides, the further studying of mystique only deepened that desire: to demonstrate and to cling to the claim that I have not, nor am I able to, recognized all that the forementioned mystics and mystiques theorists wanted to say. But I am certain of one thing: both the former and the latter agree in one, no matter how different among themselves they might be: <b>it</b> <b>is</b> enough to perceive that mystique is here, in the same way the mystic of the Christian East emphasises that the mystic does not see Christ on Tabor, but rather sees light, in the same way Moses before that did not see God but the burning bush. Mystique is a mystery. If we were to take off that veil, mystique would die — and parhaps we would die too. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> like poetry: <b>it</b> <b>is</b> here, but unsaid; interpreted, but uninterpreted and uninterpretable. For me <b>it</b> <b>was</b> important to open up the problem and present it in, for now, only a few of its diversities and do so exactly there where I have not been able to find a definite answer, because I am becoming more and more convinced that there is not one anyway...|$|R
