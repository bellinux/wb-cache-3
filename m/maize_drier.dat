The <b>maize</b> <b>dried</b> on bare ground took five days to dry to safe storage moisture content of 14 % while that of the biomass dryer took only 6 h. <b>Drying</b> <b>maize</b> grain using the biomass dryer delayed insect infestation by three months and significantly (p≤ 0. 05) reduced mould and aflatoxin contamination during storage for 6 months. <b>Maize</b> <b>dried</b> using the biomass dryer was only infested with Angoumois grain moth (Sitotroga cerealella) while that dried on bare ground was infested by both the moth and the maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais) implying that the biomass dryer controlled the most important storage insect pest of <b>maize</b> in Uganda. <b>Drying</b> <b>maize</b> using the biomass dryer had no effect on the germination potential of the grain.

UNEP's industry and environment office has produced comprehensive guidelines which stress simple and inexpensive techniques to reduce food losses.

40|$|Drying {{of plant}} {{materials}} {{is a normal}} procedure in studies of potential nitrogen (N) mineralization. However, {{little is known about}} effect of excessive drying at higher temperatures on the degree of N mineralization of many common agricultural residues. An aerobic incubation experiment (for 16 weeks) was, therefore, carried out to determine the effect of drying temperature on N mineralization from above- and below- ground plant parts of maize (Zea mays) and groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) incorporated (4 t ha- 1) in an acid topsoil (Typic Paleudult) from a humid tropical climate. Oven drying at 70 °C for two days reduced total N compared to that at 30 °C by 12 % to 26 % and 9 % to 42 % for maize and groundnut plant materials, respectively. The C/N ratio increased, with increase in heat of drying, from 28 to 32 for maize stover, 32 to 42 for maize roots and 22 to 36 for groundnut haulm. By the end of 16 weeks of decomposition, total soil mineral N (TSMN) levels were 106. 0 and 78. 7 mg N g– 1 soil from the <b>maize</b> stover <b>dried</b> at 30 oC and 70 °C, respectively. The corresponding amount from <b>maize</b> roots <b>dried</b> at 30 °C was 87. 7 mg N g– 1 and at 70 oC was 67. 0 mg N g– 1 soil. For groundnut, the respective TSMN from haulm were 112. 5 and 72. 4, while for roots were 60. 1 and 41. 9 mg N g– 1 soil.

Fusarium section Liseola included the prevalent fungi in maize kernels; sampling, in field at harvest and at the storehouse, gave comparable results, while a reduction in fungi colony forming units was noticed after drying, attributed to the thermal treatment.

Primary extraction of the biopolymers normally involves dry or wet milling, or a combination of the two. Conventional dry milling primarily separates the grain into its anatomical components, which are to some extent enriched in certain biopolymers, for example endosperm flour is approximately 80 % starch. Further enrichment of particular polymers can be achieved on the basis of density through air-classification. Wet milling, which also involves size separation by sieving and density separation by hydroclones and centrifugation, is particular effective at separating and purifying the individual biopolymers. Improvements in the efficiency of extraction of individual biopolymers may be achieved by several strategies.
