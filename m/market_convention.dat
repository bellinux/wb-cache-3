25|$|Currencies are traded {{against one}} another in pairs. Each {{currency}} pair thus constitutes an individual trading product and is traditionally noted XXXYYY or XXX/YYY, where XXX and YYY are the ISO 4217 international three-letter code of the currencies involved. The first currency (XXX) is the base currency that is quoted relative to the second currency (YYY), called the counter currency (or quote currency). For instance, the quotation EURUSD (EUR/USD) 1.5465 {{is the price of}} the Euro expressed in US dollars, meaning 1 euro = 1.5465 dollars. The <b>market</b> <b>convention</b> is to quote most exchange rates against the USD with the US dollar as the base currency (e.g. USDJPY, USDCAD, USDCHF). The exceptions are the British pound (GBP), Australian dollar (AUD), the New Zealand dollar (NZD) and the euro (EUR) where the USD is the counter currency (e.g. GBPUSD, AUDUSD, NZDUSD, EURUSD).|$|E

2500|$|The {{yield to}} {{maturity}} (YTM), book yield or redemption yield of a bond or other fixed-interest security, such as gilts, is the internal {{rate of return}} (IRR, overall interest rate) earned by an investor who buys the bond today at the market price, assuming that the bond will be held until maturity, and that all coupon and principal payments will be made on schedule. Yield to maturity is the discount rate at which the sum of all future cash flows from the bond (coupons and principal) is equal to the price of the bond. The YTM is often given in terms of Annual Percentage Rate (A.P.R.), but more often <b>market</b> <b>convention</b> is followed. In a number of major markets (such as gilts) the convention is to quote annualised yields with semi-annual compounding (see compound interest); [...] thus, for example, an annual effective yield of 10.25% would be quoted as 10.00%, because 1.05 × 1.05 = 1.1025.|$|E

40|$|Climate change poses a {{significant}} threat to future {{social and economic}} activities. This article seeks to understand how corporations respond to climate uncertainties and threats through the performance of different 'risks', including market, reputational, regulatory and physical risks. In doing this, we demonstrate how these risks are performative and political. Based on interviews and document analysis, we show how climate change risks are naturalized within <b>market</b> <b>conventions</b> through processes of reiterating climate change as risk, codifying the risk in monetary value, entangling the risk in <b>market</b> <b>conventions</b> and cementing the frame through political activities. We also show how these risk frames have political effects in that they fail to fully account for, or represent, the complexities of climate change. Indeed, the social and natural consequences of climate change undermine the risk models that seek to explain and predict these events. The consequences of these 'misfires' highlight the political nature of risk frames in that their effects are unequally distributed among less powerful actors. Importantly, however, these misfires also {{have the potential to}} provide space for new interventions in responding to climate change...|$|R

50|$|Bank Negara Monetary Notes (BNMN) are {{securities}} issued by Bank Negara Malaysia replacing the existing Bank Negara Bills (BNB) {{for purposes of}} managing liquidity in both the conventional and Islamic financial market. The maturity of these issuances has been lengthened {{from one year to}} three years however, this is not intended to signal any targeted level of long-term interest rates. The Overnight Policy Rate remains the sole indicator of the monetary policy stance while short-term and long-term interest rates at other maturities will continue to be market determined, reflecting overall demand and supply conditions as well as prevailing interest rate expectations in the financial market. New issuances of BNMN may be issued either on a discounted or a coupon-bearing basis depending on investors' demand. Discount-based BNMN will be traded using the same <b>market</b> <b>convention</b> as the existing BNB and Malaysian Treasury Bills (MTB) while the coupon-based BNMN will adopt the <b>market</b> <b>convention</b> of Malaysian Government Securities (MGS).The inaugural issuance was on 8 December 2006 with an issue size of RM1. billion.|$|E

50|$|There is a <b>market</b> <b>convention</b> {{that determines}} {{which is the}} fixed {{currency}} and which is the variable currency. In {{most parts of the}} world, the order is: EUR - GBP - AUD - NZD - USD - others. Accordingly, in a conversion from EUR to AUD, EUR is the fixed currency, AUD is the variable currency and the exchange rate indicates how many Australian dollars would be paid or received for 1 Euro. Cyprus and Malta, which were quoted as the base to the USD and others, were recently removed from this list when they joined the Eurozone.|$|E
5000|$|In {{some areas}} of Europe and in the retail market in the United Kingdom, EUR and GBP are {{reversed}} so that GBP is quoted as the fixed currency to the euro. In order to determine which is the fixed currency when neither currency is on the above list (i.e. both are [...] "other"), <b>market</b> <b>convention</b> {{is to use the}} fixed currency which gives an exchange rate greater than 1.000. This reduces rounding issues and the need to use excessive numbers of decimal places. There are some exceptions to this rule: for example, the Japanese often quote their currency as the base to other currencies.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Market</b> <b>convention</b> {{from the}} early 1980s to 2006 was that most {{currency}} pairs were quoted to four decimal places for spot transactions and up to six decimal places for forward outrights or swaps.

An exception to this was exchange rates with a value of less than 1.000 which were usually quoted to five or six decimal places. Although there is no fixed rule, exchange rates numerically greater than around 20 were usually quoted to three decimal places and exchange rates greater than 80 were quoted to two decimal places. Currencies over 5000 were usually quoted with no decimal places (for example, the former Turkish Lira). e.g. (GBPOMR : 0.765432 - : 1.4436 - EURJPY : 165.29). In other words, quotes are given with five digits. Where rates are below 1, quotes frequently include five decimal places.|$|E

From this upfront payment, we calculate the implied deal spread under alternate notional schedules of the underlying CMBS and recalculate the basis. We find that for most trade dates in our sample, the market deal spread trades far wider than is implied under a scenario of severe defaults in the underlying. The degree of distortion on spreads is amplified as the level of subordination and credit quality declines. The technical factors underlying CMBX trading dominate movements in spreads {{to such a degree that}} the level of default risk in the constituent CMBS is obscured.

40|$|Purpose – In the UK, while fashion apparel {{purchasing}} {{is available}} {{to the majority of}} consumers, the main supermarkets seem – rather against the odds and <b>market</b> <b>conventions</b> – to have created a new, socially-acceptable and legitimate, apparel market offer for young children. This study aims to explore parental purchasing decisions on apparel for young children (below ten years old) focusing on supermarket diversification into apparel and consumer resistance against other traditional brands. Design/methodology/approach – Data collection adopted a qualitative research mode: using semi-structured interviews in two locations (Cornwall Please correct and check againand Glasgow), each with a Tesco and ASDA located outside towns. A total of 59 parents participated in the study. Interviews took place in the stores, with parents seen buying children fashion apparel. Findings – The findings suggest that decisions are based not only on functionality (e. g. convenience, value for money, refund policy), but also on intuitive factors (e. g. style, image, quality) as well as broader processes of consumption from parental boundary setting (e. g. curbing premature adultness). Positive consumer resistance is leading to a re-drawing of the cultural boundaries of fashion. In some cases, concerns are expressed regarding items that seem too adult-like or otherwise not as children's apparel should be. Practical implications – The paper highlights the increasing importance of browsing as a modern choice practice (e. g. planned impulse buying, sanctuary of social activity). Particular attention is given to explaining why consumers positively resist buying from traditional label providers and voluntarily choose supermarket clothing ranges without any concerns over their children wearing such garments. Originality/value – The paper shows that supermarket shopping for children's apparel is now firmly part of UK consumption habits and choice. The findings provide theoretical insights into the significance of challenging <b>market</b> <b>conventions,</b> parental cultural boundary setting and positive resistance behaviour...|$|R
50|$|As OTC instruments, {{interest}} rate swaps (IRSs) can be customised {{in a number of}} ways and can be structured to meet the specific needs of the counterparties. For example; payment dates could be irregular, the notional of the swap could be amortized over time, reset dates (or fixing dates) of the floating rate could be irregular, mandatory break clauses may be inserted into the contract, etc. A common form of customisation is often present in new issue swaps where the fixed leg cashflows are designed to replicate those cashflows received as the coupons on a purchased bond. The interbank market, however, only has a few standardised types. Each currency has its own standard <b>market</b> <b>conventions</b> regarding the frequency of payments, the day count conventions and the end-of-month rule.|$|R
