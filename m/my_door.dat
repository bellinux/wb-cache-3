But she's not really interested in any of it. She just wants to go to school. She says to me, 'Mum, I just want to be a normal kid. I'm not ready for any of that.' I respect that, and if she ever wants to work with me on any level, I welcome it. But otherwise, I leave her to homework and school.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, Scorsese {{made his}} first feature-length film, {{the black and white}} I Call First, which was later retitled Who's That Knocking at <b>My</b> <b>Door</b> with his fellow {{students}} actor Harvey Keitel and editor Thelma Schoonmaker, both of whom were to become long-term collaborators. This film was intended to be the first of Scorsese's semiautobiographical J. R. Trilogy, which also would have included a later film, Mean Streets.|$|E
25|$|Thelma Colbert Schoonmaker (born January 3, 1940) is a French-born American {{film editor}} {{who has worked}} with {{director}} Martin Scorsese for over forty years. She started working with Scorsese on his debut feature film Who's That Knocking at <b>My</b> <b>Door</b> (1967), and edited all of Scorsese's films since Raging Bull (1980). Schoonmaker has received seven Academy Award nominations for Best Film Editing, and has won three times—for Raging Bull (1980), The Aviator (2004), and The Departed (2006).|$|E

25|$|More recently, {{his films}} have {{featured}} corrupt authority figures, such as policemen in The Departed and politicians in Gangs of New York and The Aviator. Guilt is a prominent theme {{in many of}} his films, as {{is the role of}} Catholicism in creating and dealing with guilt (Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Bringing Out the Dead, Mean Streets, Who's That Knocking at <b>My</b> <b>Door,</b> The Departed, Shutter Island). He has been noted for his liberal usage of profanity and violence.|$|E
25|$|She {{signed up}} for a brief six-week course in filmmaking at New York University (NYU), where she came into contact with budding young filmmaker Martin Scorsese, who was {{struggling}} to complete his film What's a Nice Girl Like You Doing in a Place Like This? A negative cutter had butchered his film, not leaving enough negative frames to allow for hot splicing. One of her film professors asked Schoonmaker to help Scorsese; a close working relationship with him unfolded over the next thirty-five years. Schoonmaker edited Scorsese's first feature film, Who's That Knocking at <b>My</b> <b>Door</b> (1967).|$|E
25|$|Usually has a quick cameo in {{his films}} (Who's That Knocking at <b>My</b> <b>Door,</b> Boxcar Bertha, Mean Streets, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy, After Hours, The Last Temptation of Christ (albeit hidden under a hood), The Age of Innocence, Gangs of New York, Hugo). Also, often {{contributes}} {{his voice to}} a film without appearing on screen (e.g. as in The Aviator and The Wolf of Wall Street). He provides the opening voice-over narration in Mean Streets and The Color of Money; plays the off-screen dressing room attendant in the final scene of Raging Bull; provides {{the voice of the}} unseen ambulance dispatcher in Bringing Out the Dead.|$|E

500|$|In the {{original}} poem, the verse says [...] "Without {{going out of}} <b>my</b> <b>door,</b> I can know the ways of heaven." [...] And so to prevent any misinterpretations – and also to make the song a bit longer – I did repeat that as a second verse but made it: [...] "Without going out of your door / You can know all things on earth / Without looking out of your window / You can know the ways of heaven" [...] – so that it included everybody.|$|E
500|$|When {{people did}} confess to even a minor {{role in the}} rioting, such as {{throwing}} a few stones, they were charged with affray. One resident told the 1986 Gifford Inquiry into the rioting: [...] "You would go to bed and you would just lie there and you would think, {{are they going to}} come and kick <b>my</b> <b>door,</b> what's going to happen to my children?... It was that horrible fear that you lived with day by day, knowing they could come and kick down your door and hold you for hours." [...] The inquiry heard that 9,165 police officers were either deployed on the estate or held in reserve between 10 and 14 October 1985. Thus, argues Rose, the police created, or at least intensified, a climate of fear in which witnesses were afraid to step forward.|$|E
500|$|The song {{has been}} used to {{perpetuate}} the myth of Johnson selling his soul to the Devil for his musical ability. [...] The lyrics do not contain any references to Satan or a Faustian bargain, but they have been interpreted as a description of the singer's fear of losing his soul to the Devil (presumably in exchange for his talent). [...] Music historian Elijah Wald believes that Johnson's verses do not support the idea. [...] Delta bluesman Tommy Johnson promoted himself as having made a deal with the Devil and Southern folklore identifies a crossroads or graveyard as the site of such a pact, which Wald identifies as likely sources of the myth. [...] However, musicologist Robert Palmer points out that Johnson was [...] "fascinated with and probably obsessed by supernatural imagery." [...] His song [...] "Hellhound on My Trail" [...] tells of trying to stay ahead of the demon hound which is pursuing him and in [...] "Me and the Devil Blues" [...] he sings, [...] "Early this mornin' when you knocked upon <b>my</b> <b>door,</b> and I said 'Hello Satan I believe it's time to go'". [...] These songs contribute to the Faustian myth; how much Johnson promoted the idea is debated, although many agree [...] "the 'devil angle' made for good marketing".|$|E

500|$|An Argyle Hall of Famer {{returned}} to Home Park on 18 October 2009, when former England international Paul Mariner was appointed as the club's new head coach. [...] "In football, {{there is not}} much sentiment. But, if sentiment is involved in this scenario, then they gave me my very first chance as a player so I grabbed it with both hands," [...] said Mariner on the New England Revolution website, the club he left to rejoin Argyle. [...] "Plymouth Argyle are in my blood. Obviously the teams you're associated with are the ones you look for every week, and when they came knocking on <b>my</b> <b>door</b> asking me to be employed there, I was delighted." [...] His first match in the dugout alongside Sturrock ended in disappointment as Argyle lost 3–1 to Bristol City at Ashton Gate. They faced Ipswich Town, another side struggling for form, at home in their next match and a first-half goal from Fletcher put Argyle ahead, but their hopes of claiming three points were dented when the visitors equalised through striker Jon Stead, who capitalised on a poor back pass from Gary Sawyer. Welshman Darcy Blake, on loan from Cardiff City, was shown a straight red card late in the game as it ended all square. Their final game of October took place on Halloween against Middlesbrough, in Gordon Strachan's first game as their new manager. Argyle came away from the Riverside Stadium with all three points, in a game that saw Adam Johnson miss from the penalty spot, thanks to a second-half goal from Mackie to lift them to 22nd in the league table, within three points of Doncaster Rovers.|$|E

Not that I stood toe to toe with him, but I tried to take the shot and I came up short." [...] Futch opined that Spinks was undone because he {{abandoned}} his gameplan of boxing and moving early on and instead tried to win Tyson's respect. Spinks later conceded that [...] "fear was knocking at <b>my</b> <b>door</b> big time." [...] Tyson said [...] "The first punch I threw, he wobbled a bit. I knew right there I had him," [...] adding [...] "my trainer told me before the fight that he bet both our purses that I would knock {{him out in the}} first round. So I went out and knocked him out in the first round. And later I found out he was fooling." [...] Tyson dedicated the win to Jimmy Jacobs, who had died in March.|$|E

2500|$|On June 25, 2009, American {{recording}} artist, Michael Jackson, {{died from}} cardiac arrest {{at the age}} of 50, later revealed to be from a drug intoxication of the anesthetic drug Propofol (also known as [...] "Diprivan"). Jackson was friends with musicians Chris Brown, Diddy, Boyz II Men and The Game. Aside from being friends with some of the musicians involved on the song, others involved had also respected and admired Jackson. According to The Game, prior to Jackson's death Jackson, Diddy and Eminem had tried to end the feuding and tension between rapper 50 Cent and The Game in 2005. The Game stated that in 2005, Jackson called him and offered to help end the feud, remembering [...] "I was on tour in Canada, sitting in my room, cutting my hair [...] I was messing my hair up. Then my road manager knocks on <b>my</b> <b>door.</b> Boom, boom, boom. He told me, I got MJ on the phone. I ran and snatched up the phone." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Portnoy left Dream Theater, {{relationships}} {{between him and}} his former bandmates became strained. In February 2011, Portnoy complained that no one from the band was returning his calls and e-mails. However, later Portnoy commented that both Petrucci and Rudess were the only members that stayed in touch with him. Tensions became especially high when Portnoy called James LaBrie [...] "disrespectful" [...] for comments LaBrie made during an interview, stating that Dream Theater were [...] "not sad at all" [...] that Portnoy was no longer a band member. As of July 12, 2011, LaBrie has not remained in touch with Portnoy. At one point, false reports surfaced that Portnoy had sued Dream Theater. [...] Portnoy has since stated that he would rejoin the band in a heartbeat, stating: [...] "They are the ones that have closed the door on it. I’ve only needed a break, and I’ve had that break. So I’m ready, willing and able. But I honestly don’t think they ever will; they’ve closed their door on it and I think they’re too headstrong in having to prove themselves without me. So I wouldn’t count on it. But <b>my</b> <b>door</b> is always open." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scorsese {{is known}} for his {{frequent}} use of slow motion, for example, in Who's That Knocking at <b>My</b> <b>Door</b> (1967), Mean Streets (1973), Taxi Driver (1976), Raging Bull (1980), Goodfellas (1990), and The Wolf of Wall Street (2013). Also known for using freeze frame, such as the opening credits of The King of Comedy (1983), and throughout Goodfellas (1990). Such a shot is also used in Casino (1995) and The Departed (2006). His blonde leading ladies are usually seen {{through the eyes of the}} protagonist as angelic and ethereal; they wear white in their first scene and are photographed in slow motion (Cybill Shepherd in Taxi Driver; Cathy Moriarty's white bikini in Raging Bull; Sharon Stone's white minidress in Casino). This may possibly be a nod to director Alfred Hitchcock. Scorsese often uses long tracking shots, as seen in Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Casino, Gangs of New York, and Hugo. Use of MOS sequences set to popular music or voice-over, often involving aggressive camera movement and/or rapid editing. Scorsese sometimes highlights characters in a scene with an iris, an homage to 1920s silent film cinema (as scenes at the time sometimes used this transition). This effect can be seen in Casino (it is used on Sharon Stone and Joe Pesci), Life Lessons, The Departed (on Matt Damon), and Hugo. Some of his films include references/allusions to Westerns, particularly Rio Bravo, The Great Train Robbery, Shane, The Searchers, and The Oklahoma Kid. Slow motion flashbulbs and accented camera/flash/shutter sounds are often used, as is song [...] "Gimme Shelter" [...] by The Rolling Stones; heard in several of Scorsese's films: Goodfellas, Casino, and The Departed.|$|E
