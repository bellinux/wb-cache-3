5|$|Homer and Bart are {{watching}} television {{when they are}} interrupted by Lisa playing her saxophone in her bedroom. Bart enters Lisa's bedroom and tries to grab the saxophone from her, but he inadvertently tosses it out the window. It lands in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> and is run over by traffic and stomped on by Nelson Muntz. In a period of mourning, Lisa reveals she cannot remember ever not having that saxophone, so Homer recounts the instrument's origins.|$|E
5|$|In Alexandria, Virginia, sixteen-year-old Dara Kernof (Emily Perkins), a {{severely}} {{mentally and physically}} disabled girl confined to a wheelchair, somehow manages to leave her house {{in the middle of}} the night, soon after her baptism. Her father, Lance (Eric Keenleyside), finds her in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> with her arms raised upward, kneeling before a Dark Figure. Suddenly, lightning flashes and the Dark Figure disappears. When Lance reaches Dara, he realizes she is dead and that her eyes are gone, as if having been burned out of their sockets.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 27 November 1923, a slight misjudgement {{at the end of}} the tunnel {{enlargement}} work left the tunnel unstable near Borough. A collapse on the same day, caused when a train hit temporary shoring near Elephant & Castle, filled the tunnel with wet gravel. Later a gas main exploded, causing a water main to break and leaving a water-filled crater in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> The line was briefly split in two, but was completely closed on 28 November 1923.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} {{begins with a}} girl talking about what she wants in her next boyfriend while on some bleachers. After her {{monologue}} is over, the video cuts between shots of Eric Church and scenes of the girl and a boy during various high points and low points in their relationship. Church is seen throughout the video either playing with his band in a garage, in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> on a piano, or walking through the streets with an American flag around his shoulders while singing. The video ends without showing whether the girl and boy ended up together.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Madonna walking {{at night in}} the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> of an American city {{surrounded}} by skyscrapers and wind. Then she finds herself in another dimension, as moving flowers surround her. As the video advances, Madonna walks on other different kinds of roads. She walks on a path of red flowers in the sky, and then walks on her knees on a deep, blue colored sea, as she is followed by little white fairies. At the end of the video, when there is destruction in the real dimension, Madonna finds peace and is surrounded by the fairies. When they go away, Madonna disappears altogether.|$|E
5|$|The {{old town}} {{comprises}} {{a large number}} of medieval and Renaissance buildings. The quai des Tanneurs ("tanners' quay") {{is one of the most}} picturesque streets in Alsace. A stream used to flow in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> until the beginning of the 20th century, the relic of a former noxious-smelling trade, since tanning required large amounts of flowing water for treating and washing animal skins. Most of the old tanner houses date back to the Middle Ages and have a tall attic to provide a ventilated space for drying leather. In the neighbouring streets, rue des Oies ("geese street") and rue des Veaux ("calf street"), many houses were covered with a coat of plaster in the 19th century in order to hide the timbering, which was considered too rustic.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Main <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> Victoria, Charles & Gamon used to {{accommodate}} a tram line that ran through <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Seddon Village.

50|$|Shocked and angered at the {{election}} results, students marched out of Berkeley and into Oakland {{in the early}} morning hours of November 9. As they marched into Oakland, more people joined the protest. The protesters blocked roads and lit several trash cans and newspaper boxes on fire in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b> Protesters vandalized cars and burned American flags for hours in Oakland.|$|R
5|$|The subpoenas are {{handed out}} in the hearing over Bartlet's {{concealment}} of his multiple sclerosis. The special prosecutor, Clement Rollins (Pryor), appears to be both fair and responsible, but C.J. believes the White House will be better served {{in the public eye}} if investigated by a partisan agent. She therefore decides—against the strong objections of White House counsel Oliver Babish—to present Rollins as an ally of the administration, thereby forcing Congress to take control over the investigation. Meanwhile Donna, unwittingly, becomes entangled in potential problems over the hearings. Ainsley Hayes sets her up on a date with the Republican House Government Oversight Committee counsel Clifford Calley, but even though the date seems to go well, Calley then leaves her quite abruptly in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> Donna later realizes the reason: his congressional committee is the one that will {{be in charge of the}} investigation, and a relationship between the two could constitute a conflict of interest.|$|E
5|$|Controversy {{continued}} to flare in Britain {{and other countries}} regarding sporting links with South Africa. The South Africa rugby team's 1969–70 tour of Britain and Ireland was accompanied by mass demonstrations against apartheid, including an attempt by a protester in London to hijack the South African team bus, and a demonstration in Dublin where people {{tried to stop the}} South Africans from reaching the match venue by lying down in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> The South Africa cricket team was due to tour England shortly afterwards, and the MCC remained keen for the series to go ahead. They cancelled the tour a week before the South Africans were due to arrive, following public protests and pressure from the UK government. Virulent anti-apartheid demonstrations in Australia during the South Africa rugby team's 1971 tour led to soaring police costs, matches played behind fences and barbed wire, and a state of emergency in Queensland, all of which prompted the Australian Cricket Board to cancel the tour by the South Africa cricket team that had been scheduled to follow.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} scene in which Eminem stands on the rooftop of the Manhattan Municipal Building in New York, saying the {{introductory}} lyrics. The video cuts between scenes where he raps on the rooftop and another scene where Eminem is trapped inside a dark basement. Eminem moves closer towards the edge of the building until he leaves to go downstairs as the chorus begins. He starts walking down Market Street in Newark and jaywalks across the street, avoiding vehicles that pass by. Eminem sees distorted reflections of himself on the window of a car; he continues on, only to be surrounded by a series of mirrors. Confused, Eminem tries to escape, and {{towards the end of the}} second chorus, he breaks through a mirror to find himself in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> Interspersing scenes show Eminem as he tries to break out of the basement. As the camera zooms out, the viewers see him on the edge of a destroyed street while a subway tunnel can be seen below the road.|$|E
5000|$|Hanging {{her head}} in defeat, Xiao Shi wanders through <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> until a {{stranger}} bumped into a her. This stranger {{happens to be the}} 22-year-old in disguise, He Qun, who's just run away from his own press conference and in <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> fleeing <b>the</b> paparazzi. The clumsy encounter leaves <b>the</b> both <b>of</b> them in a compromising position in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> allowing <b>the</b> paparazzi to obtain a few shots <b>of</b> <b>the</b> both <b>of</b> them [...] "kissing".|$|R
50|$|From then on, small tremors {{continued}} {{throughout the}} day. The frightened, terrified look <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people going through <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> <b>the</b> slightest noise being sufficient to startle and set every soul running out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> houses to <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> and to <b>the</b> squares, every slight shock <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth strikes terror into <b>the</b> soul <b>of</b> every one, {{each and every}} one expecting unheard-of calamity. Whole families were emigrating from the city to the country on a large scale.|$|R
50|$|In early 2011, {{improvements}} to <b>the</b> High <b>Street</b> began with regeneration on the ‘southern gateway’ and {{a creation of}} a 'town square' in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> High <b>Street.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{scene when}} Walter {{approaches}} Gus' house {{with plans to}} kill him ends with an extremely high crane shot of Walter standing alone in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> MacLaren wanted that shot to be extremely effective because she believed it conveyed Walter's helplessness, insignificance and lack of experience. Although the normal crane used for such overhead shots in Breaking Bad was only 30 feet tall, MacLaren rented a 180-foot-tall crane specifically for that shot. Since the crew had only about four hours to shoot before losing the night-time hours, the crane shot {{was the first one}} they filmed. It was shot by camera operators Andrew Voegeli, with dolly grip David Jaxx Nagro and gaffer Steven Litecky. Later, for the scene when Walter meets with Mike at a bar, MacLaren backlit Walter as he entered so only his silhouette would be visible when he entered. When the shots of Mike punching Walter was originally filmed, the staging involved Mike standing up, then Walter standing up, then Mike suddenly punching him. Vince Gilligan edited the scene to have Mike simply punch Walter instead to make the action faster and more surprising. The scene was arranged by stunt coordinator Al Goto, and actors Bryan Cranston and Jonathan Banks performed the stunts themselves. Mike kicks Walter several times after he falls, and Goto placed a large sandbag against Cranston's torso for Banks to kick during those scenes.|$|E
25|$|Pedestrian refuges {{or small}} {{islands in the}} <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> can help reduce lane widths.|$|E

50|$|The {{property}} is on <b>the</b> southwest corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intersection <b>of</b> South Highland and Maple Place, across the former from Ossining High School {{and the latter}} from the brick 1870 First Presbyterian Church designed by Isaac G. Perry. The historic district boundary currently runs in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> between those buildings, {{both of which are}} contributing properties to the district, and the cottage. To the west are other houses; an apartment building is to the south. The lot slopes to the west, in <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hudson River.|$|R
50|$|By 2015, the {{entrance}} square was completely restored. <b>The</b> only reminder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> revolution events is an amateur monument erected in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hrushevskoho <b>Street</b> driveway opposite <b>the</b> stadium gate.|$|R
25|$|Railroads {{were such}} a {{dominant}} form of transportation in those days; the square was perpetually coated with soot from the locomotives running down tracks in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> The new station had doors at either end which were closed after the arrival and departure of the trains.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{the surface}} {{portions}} of the light rail line will fit into the street environment. Light-rail tracks will be laid on the surface within reserved lanes in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> and cross street intersections at grade. Surface stations will have simple, low-level platforms. However, like heavy rail and light metro, passengers {{will be able to}} board light rail trains by multiple doors.|$|E
25|$|Night falls, and {{she exits}} {{the car in}} Chinatown, London, pursued by an unknown man. She runs through an alley, and kisses a man, {{dragging}} him into a nearby building. She removes her jacket, revealing the black mini-dress, and dances seductively next to a motorcycle. They then both leave the building, with the man driving the motorcycle, and stop in a crowded street. Minogue dances {{on the back of}} the motorcycle, and in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> while the man circles her, performing a wheelie. The video ends with the crowd looking on, as the pair perform a burnout, and leave the alley.|$|E
50|$|The village well in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main <b>street</b> was sunk in 1589. Thorpe Malsor Hall is a Jacobean {{house that}} was refenestrated in the 18th century and {{enlarged}} in 1817.|$|R
50|$|During {{the period}} when the {{neighborhood}} was divided, a two-foot high barbed wire fence was erected down <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main <b>street</b> with Arab Legionnaires and Israeli soldiers guarding on each side.|$|R

25|$|When Germany {{defaulted}} on its reparation payments, French and Belgian troops occupied the heavily industrialised Ruhr district (January 1923). The German government encouraged {{the population of}} the Ruhr to passive resistance: shops would not sell goods to the foreign soldiers, coal-miners would not dig for the foreign troops, trams in which members of the occupation army had taken seat would be left abandoned in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> The passive resistance proved effective, insofar as the occupation became a loss-making deal for the French government. But the Ruhr fight also led to hyperinflation, and many who lost all their fortune would become bitter enemies of the Weimar Republic, and voters of the anti-democratic right. See 1920s German inflation.|$|E
25|$|The {{day after}} celebrating his son Jason's 10th birthday, Ethan Mars {{and his family}} go {{shopping}} at a local mall. While buying some balloons from a clown, Ethan notices that Jason has wandered off and frantically searches for him. Eventually, he finds him outside in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> right {{in the path of}} an oncoming car. Just as Ethan reunites with Jason, he is struck and killed, while Ethan goes into a coma. After waking up from a six-month coma, Ethan, blaming himself for Jason's death, divorces his wife and moves into a small suburban house. He develops severe mental trauma and starts experiencing blackouts at an alarming rate. Two years later, while at the park with Shaun, Ethan suddenly blacks out. When he wakes up, Shaun has vanished.|$|E
25|$|An {{attempt was}} also {{made in the}} late 18th century {{to improve the quality}} of street lighting. In 1669, under Louis XIV, the city was already lit with three {{thousand}} oil lamps, suspended in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> at a height of twenty feet, with twenty feet between each lantern, but not every street was lit, and the light was usually very dim; those going out at night or to the theater were usually obliged to hire a lantern-bearer to light their way until the end of the century. Between 1745 and 1769, the old lanterns were gradually replaced by a new model called a réverbère which, mounted on a lamp post, gave off a much brighter light. By 1789 there were 5,694 new lanterns in service. A few years later the most popular revolutionary song, Ça ira! urged Parisians to hang aristocrats from the new lanterns.|$|E
25|$|Brown's body lay {{isolated}} in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> suburban <b>street</b> {{for four hours}} allowing <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> local residents to crowd the close vicinity in disbelief and expressions <b>of</b> vocal indignation. <b>The</b> Ferguson unrest found its beginnings within this period of time.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>middle</b> section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> {{contains}} numerous alleys stretching east {{while the}} block {{on the opposite}} side forms a continuous block, <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> which is caused by the medieval city wall which stretched behind the block, along the fronts facing Baggensgatan.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brisbane {{structures}} {{built for}} the war were removed at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> World War II. The saltwater mains, slit trenches, and sirens disappeared, as did the many standard pillboxes that had stood in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> central business district. 156 standard pillboxes were built, but none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surviving public shelters in Brisbane City Council ownership are of that design. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> 21 special shelters, only the one on Queens Wharf Road survives. However, of Costello's 58 reusable public surface shelters, 20 have survived; <b>the</b> removal <b>of</b> their blast walls, as planned, had given them a renewed purpose. The worker's shelters at the Story Bridge and Howard Smith Wharves also still exist.|$|R
