40|$|A two {{dimensional}} mathematical <b>model</b> <b>DUCT,</b> {{which is based}} on a parabolic boundary layer technique, using finite elements, is proposed to predict the flow and turbulence field in complicated geometrical conditions, where recirculating flow may occur. Numerical results of the DUCT-model are compared with k-eps-predictions as well as laboratory experiments concerning the flow in a number of configurations. In the case of a steep lee-side the location of the separation point is not well located, because the normal stresses in the equation of motion are neglected. Generally the velocities in the deceleration and acceleration zone are satisfactory. An advantage of the application of the DUCT-model compared with the sophisticated k-E-model is the relatively low computation time used to solve the set of equations.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a practical method to optimize in-building section of centralized Heating, Ventilation and Air-conditioning (HVAC) systems which consist of indoor air loops and chilled water loops. First, through component characteristic analysis, mathematical models associated with cooling loads and energy consumption for heat exchangers and energy consuming devices are established. By considering variation of cooling load of each end user, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is employed to <b>model</b> <b>duct</b> and pipe networks and obtain optimal differential pressure (DP) set points based on limited sensor information. A mix-integer nonlinear constraint optimization of system energy is formulated and solved by a modified genetic algorithm. The main feature of our paper is a systematic approach in optimizing the overall system energy consumption {{rather than that}} of individual component. A simulation study for a typical centralized HVAC system is provided to compare the proposed optimization method with traditional ones.

A Coherent Anti-stokes Raman Spectroscopy (CARS) system was assembled specifically for the test cell environment.

40|$|Some {{information}} is given {{how to use}} the scour model DUCT-SUSTRA (Hoffmans, 1991). The scour model predicts the morphological process in scour holes or trenches and consists of two separated sub-models: a flow <b>model</b> <b>DUCT</b> and a morphological model SUSTRA. The flow model is based on the equation of continuity and the momentum equations for turbulent flow (Vreugdenhil, 1982). The Reynolds-closure problem is solved by prescribing the eddy viscosity with model equations (Hoffmans, 1991). The concentrations are calculated by the morphological model, which is based on the convection-diffusion equation (van Rijn and Meijer, 1986). The bed load transport and the concentration at the reference level are calculated with stochastic equations. The software of the scour model is written in FORTRAN and can be installed on a personal computer. However, it is recommended to install it on a larger computer, if a grid of more than 100 nodes is desired. The models DUCT and SUSTRA are coupled by the sub-models SMOOTH, GENBLK and SUSTDUCT, figure 1. In section 2. the structure of input and plot files concerning DUCT is specified. In the subsequent sections the procedure is explained how to make a run with DUCT-SUSTRA. It is remarked that this 'manual' is still incomplete.

40|$|Methods to {{characterize}} acoustic sources in flow ducts have been investigated. In {{the first part}} of this thesis a measurement procedure {{to characterize}} an air terminal device using an acoustic one-port source model based on the two microphone technique has been tested and validated. In order to provide a prediction of flow noise generation at different operating points for the device a scaling law was derived. Successful validation experiments were performed. In the second part a new method based on the multi-load technique was developed and used to characterise the source data of various piston-engines with non-linear behaviour. The source characterisation results were compared to results obtained using the well-known linear two-load technique. It was shown that the new non-linear multi-load technique gave improved results when the source was slightly non-linear. In the third part an improved method to characterize noise sources in high temperature flowducts has been suggested. As a test environment for the standard two microphone technique a helium-air mixture has been used to simulate acoustical conditions similar to hot exhaust gas systems. In order to test the method the passive acoustic properties of automotive diesel engine and an unflanged flow duct termination have been experimentally determined. The experimental results for duct termination have been compared to theoretical predictions.

40|$|A single leak in a duct can be detected, {{located and}} sized by {{measuring}} the input impedance of the duct and then analytically solving an inverse problem. However, previously applied analytical methods break down {{when it comes to}} predicting smaller hole sizes. Results are presented which show that, by treating smaller holes as capillaries and applying appropriate theoretical approximations, accurate predictions of smaller hole sizes are possible. Extending the analytical methods to a duct containing multiple leaks is non-trivial as the resulting mathematical expressions are highly complex. In this thesis, an alternative approach which uses optimisation methodology to detect, locate and size multiple leaks in a duct is described. The optimisation algorithms are applied to a measurement of the duct’s input impedance but they are able to cope with the presence of multiple leaks. Results are presented which illustrate the success of the optimisation approach in detecting, locating and sizing multiple leaks in a duct. An objective function incorporating the theoretical input impedance of a <b>model</b> <b>duct</b> and experimental input impedance of the cylindrical pipe under investigation is designed. By studying the behaviour of the objective function and the application of different numerical optimisation methods, it is possible to determine those methods most suitable for investigating leaks.

40|$|General {{building}} energy simulation {{programs do}} not typically simulate interactions between HVAC systems and building envelopes. For this reason, a simulation tool which includes interactions between duct systems, building envelopes, and heating and cooling appliances in residential buildings has been developed. The simulation tool uses DOE- 2 (to model space conditioning loads and zone temperatures), COMIS (an airflow network solver), and a <b>model</b> of <b>duct</b> leakage and conduction losses. Three augmentations to the simulation tool are presented herein, along with sample results.

Multi-speed air conditioners are shown {{to be more sensitive}} to duct efficiency than single-speed equipment, because their efficiency decreases with increasing cooling load. Thermosiphon flows through duct systems are estimated to be 5 - 16 % of the total heating load, depending on the duct insulation level.

40|$|Our {{long-term}} {{goal is to}} contribute to the development and evaluation of an operational evaporation <b>duct</b> <b>model</b> for use in microwave propagation prediction. OBJECTIVES Our first objective is to develop a metric, involving one or more parameters, to replace evaporation duct height as a fundamental basis for comparison and evaluation of evaporation <b>duct</b> <b>models.</b> Because electromagnetic propagation is determined by vertical gradients of modified refractivity (M) and because these gradients are more uniquely determinant of propagation conditions that duct height alone (Dockery 1988, Reilly and Dockery 1990, Gehman 2000), it is felt that evaporation duct height is often inadequate for accurately describing propagation conditions.

40|$|The {{general purpose}} of this {{research}} project is to model mathematically the scour-hole downstream of a structure (2 -D). The model has to simulate {{the development of the}} scour as a function of time. Basically two models are necessary namely a flow model and a morphological model. The latter has to describe the bed- and suspended load and the erosion of the bed. In the present study the behaviour of the turbulence in the relaxation zone of a local scour hole (figure 1) is discussed. The {{purpose of this}} note is to find a function (prescription) for the eddy viscosity in the relaxation zone, which will be used in the flow <b>model</b> <b>DUCT,</b> where the eddy viscosity is prescribed (Hoffmans, 1988 b). The function for the eddy viscosity is based on the transport equations for the kinetic energy and its dissipation, in which the diffusion and gain (production) terms are neglected. Computations by means of the k-eps-model for the flow in a number of configurations (Hoffmans, 1988 a), were used for calibration. CONCLUSIONS In the relaxation zone the diffusion and the dissipation do have a damping influence on the behaviour of the turbulence parameters, while the turbulence increases by the production of the Reynolds stresses. In the derivation of the analytical solutions of the damping functions the production and the diffusion are neglected in the transport equations for the kinetic energy and its dissipation. The agreement between the results of the perturbated functions is rather good. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|Modifications {{to local}} and state codes are seen as an {{appropriate}} strategy {{for the prevention of}} residential air distribution system leakage and its impacts. A model code element has been developed to assist this strategy. Recent field studies of Florida residences by Cummings, Tooley and Moyer have revealed a mean leakage of 11 percent for the air distribution systems of central, fan-force heating and air conditioning systems. Such leakage may cause an estimated 20 percent increase in energy consumption for air conditioning, as well as a 50 percent increase in peak cooling load and an 80 percent increase in peak heating load. In addition, building air leakage may be expected to be several times greater when duct leakage is present or when avenues of air egress from closeable rooms are absent. The <b>model</b> <b>duct</b> construction element presented here contains all of the standards, definitions and code language needed to replace the current duct construction element of the local or state code. The content of this paper was used as a principal source for language adopted for the 1991 Florida Energy Efficiency Code For Building Construction. Addressed are the most appropriate standards required for the closure and sealing of metal duct, rigid fibrous glass duct, and nonmetallic flexible duct. Also addressed are (1) detailed requirements for the sealing of mechanical closets when they function as plenum chambers, (2) detailed requirements for the sealing of enclosed support platforms or air handlers and furnaces when they function as return duct, (3) detailed requirements for the sealing of uninhabitable cavities of the building structure, when they function as duct, and (4) detailed requirements for the egress of air from enclosed rooms which receive supply air.

40|$|A dynamic {{mechanical}} {{model of}} the human larynx and vocal tract has been developed to investigate its acoustic and fluid dynamic behaviour during sustained vowel production. The model comprises a cylindrical duct, open at one end, with a controlled air flow introduced at the other. The flow entering the duct is modulated by the periodic opening and closing of pair of electro-mechanically driven shutters. Far field measurements of the radiated pressure {{have shown that the}} model generates sound which has a spectral distribution that corresponds, at low frequencies, to that of an open vowel. However the spectral amplitudes were somewhat lower than voiced speech sounds normally generated at the same low rate. The addition of an orifice plate to reduce the duct exit area was found to increase the level of the radiated sound and to modify the spectral distribution somewhat. The flow distribution throughout the <b>model</b> <b>duct</b> has been measured using hot wire anemometry. The velocity distribution measured in the model was found to correspond to that measured in the oral cavity of four live subjects. Calibrate pressure measurements at the duct wall have been used define the associated pressure field within the duct. The pressure distribution found within the model corresponded to that measured in vivo by other researchers. The velocity within the duct was shown to be associated with contributions from three separate velocity fields, the rotational acoustic particle velocity and a rotational velocity field due to vortex development at the exit to the shutters. It was shown that the rotational velocity disturbance convected along the duct at approximately the local mean flow velocity. Comparison of prediction with measurement of the radiated sound fields showed that the presence of a rotational velocity field at the duct exit made a significant contribution to the radiated sound pressure level. A discussion is included as to whether acoustic sources, associated with the rotational flow, exists at area discontinuities in the vocal tract in addition to the generally accepted acoustic source due to fluctuating mass flow at the glottal exit. The influence of the Rotheberg Mask on the flow and acoustic behaviour of the model was investigated in some detail. Measurements show that the velocity field was almost unaltered, but the fluctuating pressure amplitudes were greatly reduced. Corresponding reductions were found in the radiated acoustic power with further reductions apparently due to the suppression of the rotational flow sources by the mask...|$|E

40|$|The sodium {{fast reactor}} (SFR) is {{currently}} being reconsidered as an instrument for actinide management throughout the world, {{thanks in part to}} international programs such as the Generation-IV and especially the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP). The success of these programs, in particular the GNEP, is dependent upon the ability of the SFR to manage actinide inventory while remaining economically competitive. In order to achieve these goals, the fuel must be able to operate reliably at high power densities. However, the power density of the fuel is limited by fuel-clad chemical interaction (FCCI) for metallic fuel, cladding thermal and irradiation strain, the fuel melting point, sodium boiling, {{and to a lesser extent}} the sodium pressure drop in the fuel channels. Therefore, innovative fuel configurations that reduce clad stresses, sodium pressure drops, and fuel/clad temperatures could be applied to the SFR core to directly improve the performance and economics. Two particular designs of interest that could potentially improve the performance of the SFR core are the internally and externally cooled annular fuel and the bottle-shaped fuel. In order to evaluate the thermal-hydraulic performance of these fuels, the capabilities of the RELAP 5 - 3 D code have been expanded to perform subchannel analysis in sodium-cooled fuel assemblies with non-conventional geometries. This expansion was enabled by the use of control variables in the code. When compared to the SUPERENERGY II code, the prediction of core outlet temperature agreed within 2 %. In addition, the RELAP 5 - 3 D subchannel model was applied to the ORNL 19 -pin test, and it was found that the code could predict the measured outlet temperature distribution with a maximum error of - 8 %. (cont.) As an application of this subchannel <b>model,</b> <b>duct</b> ribs were explored as a means of reducing core outlet temperature peaking within the fuel assemblies. The performance of the annular and bottle-shaped fuel was also investigated using this subchannel model. The annular fuel configurations are best suited for low conversion ratio cores. The magnitude of the power uprate enabled by metal annular fuel in the CR = 0. 25 cores is 20 %, and is limited by the FCCI constraint during a hypothetical flow blockage of the inner-annular channel due to the small diameters of the inner-annular flow channel (3. 6 mm). On the other hand, a complete blockage of the hottest inner-annular flow channel in the oxide fuel case results in sodium boiling, which renders the annular oxide fuel concept unacceptable for use in a SFR. The bottle-shaped fuel configurations are best suited for high conversion ratio cores. In the CR = 0. 71 cores, the bottle-shaped fuel configuration reduces the overall core pressure drop in the fuel channels by up to 36. 3 %. The corresponding increase in core height with bottle-shaped fuel is between 15. 6 % and 18. 3 %. A full-plant RELAP 5 - 3 D model was created to evaluate the transient performance of the base and innovative fuel configurations during station blackout and UTOP transients. The transient analysis confirmed the good thermal-hydraulic performance of the annular and bottle-shaped fuel designs with respect to their respective solid fuel pin cases. by Matthew J Memmott.

A simple kinematic model of such flames {{was developed by}} Dowling who reduced the combustion process to the propagation of an infinitely thin flame with a constant speed.

For these purposes, so-called Flame Speed Closure model for multi-dimensional simulations of premixed turbulent flames is adapted and combined with the aforementioned Dowling model. Simulations of the heat release rate dynamics for ducted flames due to oncoming flow oscillations have been performed. Typical results show that the oscillations in the integrated heat release rate follow the oncoming flow velocity oscillations with certain time delay, which controls the sign of the well-known Rayleigh integral and, hence, the global instability or stability of the combustor. The delays computed using the Dowling and the above approach are different, thus indicating the importance of resolving the flame structure when <b>modeling</b> <b>ducted</b> flame oscillations...|$|R

The key problems are solved including standardization <b>modeling</b> of <b>ducts,</b> 3 D data transfering, virtual processing analysis, digital modular fixture design/manufacturing, and NC bending/manufacturing/inspection of ducts. The technology has been successfully applied into the digital forming manufacturing of airplan ducts...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} an inviscid approach to <b>model</b> a <b>ducted</b> turbine and a comparison of simulation results with a particular one-dimensional theory. The aim of the investigation was {{to gain a better understanding}} of the ideal diffuser, a concept that is developed in the theory. An optimisation of duct shape and a set of simulations with a varied group of shapes showed that duct length, inlet radius and outlet radius are not sufficient to define an ideal diffuser. A set of simulations with cylindrical ducts confirmed the theory that a duct optimised for one loading is less than ideal at other loadings...|$|R
