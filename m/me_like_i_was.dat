500|$|Prior to {{the release}} of Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives, Herren {{performed}} at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival at Camber Sands in April 2001. The festival was curated by the band Tortoise, with whom Herren toured as the opening act in May 2001. Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives was released on June 11, 2001 through Warp on vinyl, compact disc and download. It was Warp's second release by an American musician, following Richard Devine's Lipswitch which had been released in the previous January. The album did not chart in the United States or United Kingdom. Herren was not happy on how the album was promoted, saying: [...] "I couldn't understand why they were treating <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> 10. They were ignoring all the cultural references that were to be found throughout that first record." [...] He felt the album [...] "would have been easier to package if I'd been from the Bronx. Instead I was from Miami, and lived in Decatur." ...|$|E
500|$|Filmed in real time, {{the episode}} is {{designed}} to look like it was recorded in four uninterrupted eleven-minute takes. Carter explained, [...] "I said [...] 'Wouldn't it be great since we have 44 minutes of programming time if we just did an episode where we did four 11-minute takes and put it all together?' And everyone looked at <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> nuts." [...] To film the episode, camera operator Dave Luckenbach wore a steadicam. However, the steadicam used could only hold a maximum of four minutes of film, so discreet edits and cuts were necessary. Luckenbach later likened the physical aftermath of filming to playing football, [...] "You'd have a game on Friday, and you'd wake up Saturday and really feel it." [...] The cuts were usually made during whip pans or in scenes when the screen would go dark. With the exception of Mulder jumping off the Queen Anne, the only noticeable editing occurs between scenes, when a side swipe shifts between the two different time periods. Many of the takes needed to be nearly perfect; for example, of the takes made on the eighth day of filming, only two of ten were deemed satisfactory.|$|E
500|$|Pacers coach Rick Carlisle {{said after}} the game, [...] "I felt like I was {{fighting}} for my life out there." [...] One reporter who attempted to stop Tinsley from entering the stands recalled that the player [...] "went through <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> butter", and then NBA Commissioner David Stern, watching the game on TV, recalled that he said, [...] "Holy [...]" [...] (O'Neal later said, [...] "As bad as it looked on TV, {{it was at least}} 20 times worse in person.") Pacers assistant coach Chuck Person compared the situation to being [...] "trapped in a gladiator-type scene where the fans were the lions and we were just trying to escape with our lives. That's how it felt. That there was no exit. That you had to fight your way out." [...] Players' children and others in the audience cried from fear and shock. Derrick Coleman stood near Brown and Brown's ball boy son to protect them. The remaining seconds of the game were called off and the Pacers were awarded the 97–82 win. Fans booed the Indiana players as they were escorted from the court by officials and security, and continued to throw beverages and other objects (including a folding chair that nearly hit O'Neal) at them as they walked under the tunnel to the locker room. No players from either team spoke to the media before leaving the arena. Eventually, police officers were able to swarm the arena, threatening to handcuff those who wouldn't leave. Nine spectators were injured, and two were taken to the hospital.|$|E

2500|$|On May 6, 2015, Bateman and Ginnifer Goodwin were {{announced}} {{as having been}} cast, respectively in the roles of Nick Wilde and Judy Hopps. The filmmakers chose Bateman because they wanted an actor who could bring [...] "a funny yet heartfelt side" [...] with [...] "a wily, dry-witted sort of voice." [...] Bateman described his character as [...] "a crafty, sarcastic schemer," [...] remarking on the role's similarity to many other roles he had done since he was 12. He explained that he had said to the directors: [...] "'What kind of voice do you guys want me to do?' And they just looked at <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> an idiot and said, 'Just do what you do. Just talk.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Wilson {{grew up in}} Chicago, Illinois, {{and moved}} with his parents to Santa Monica, California, at age 9. At a young age he would skip school in order to watch the Academy Awards from the bleachers. He {{attended}} University of California, Los Angeles, majoring in film and television. While attending college, he also managed [...] the Fox Theater, Westwood Village. After graduating UCLA, Wilson obtained a position working on marketing campaigns for movies and as a copywriter for a sponsor of the Los Angeles Film Festival, and watched over 200 movies per year in this capacity. In 2005, Wilson stated that he still worked in film marketing, and also worked on film trailers. His marketing work has included publicity for the Academy Awards: [...] "When {{they found out that}} I did the Razzies, they looked at <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a spy," [...] said Wilson to The Blade.|$|E
2500|$|Smith found that, at the time, nobody {{believed}} in her concept of stylish activewear. As she later recalled, even major brands like Nike {{did not have}} concept stores for their clothing in those days. When Bill Clarkson showed the products to major department store Myer, their fashion buyers were uninterested and unsure of how to position the garments. He recalls that when he explained the clothes should not be sold in the sports section, [...] "The buyer looked at <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> crazy. They had no box to put me in." [...] Eventually, Myer bought a small range for five of their stores and stocked it in a corner between swimwear and lingerie. The Lorna Jane corporate website {{goes so far as}} to credit Smith with coining the word [...] "activewear" [...] in 1989, although the Merriam-Webster dictionary notes the word's first known usage was in 1924.|$|E

2500|$|After {{placing her}} career on hiatus, Lopez {{released}} her fourth studio album, Rebirth, in February 2005. According to Lopez, Rebirth [...] "came about because I was {{on such a}} roller-coaster ride, that was my career from my first album to my last album, and I did a bunch of movie projects in between. I finally took some time just for myself, and [...] I came back, {{this was the first}} project I did. I felt like it was a new beginning for <b>me,</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> in a way, reborn." [...] Tracy Hopkins of NBC's Today Music noted that after [...] "fawning" [...] over Affleck on This Is Me... Then", Lopez [...] "wisely keeps her love life out of the spotlight" [...] on Rebirth and only references her relationship with Anthony on a few tracks. The album produced the single [...] "Get Right", which peaked at number one in the United Kingdom. In May, she starred alongside Jane Fonda in the romantic comedy Monster-in-Law, for which she received a salary of $15million. The film's marketing played up Lopez's [...] "Gigli-and-tabloid tarnished image", and it became a box office success. In August, Lopez starred alongside Robert Redford and Morgan Freeman in An Unfinished Life, a drama film based on the novel of the same name.|$|E

5000|$|Another Magazine {{published}} {{a selection of}} Birkins poetry in 2005, commenting that [...] "perhaps it is Withnail & Is writer and director Bruce Robinson who offers us the best description of the sheer assault of Birkins talent. He writes {{in his introduction to}} the collection, Anno didnt need death to be brilliant. … I love his rage, and truth, and he touches <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> still young. Anno too is a great poet, a teenage poet, and we can only be amazed by what he could do with half a yard of ink." ...|$|E

He was picked up and brought back, but he left again, the second time with his mother's blessing.

They were the first people to treat <b>me</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a human being." [...] The family was later reunited and emigrated to Canada, where Tereza Kanitz was killed by a drunk driver in Terrace, British Columbia in 1964.|$|E

5000|$|In the Los Angeles Times, Day-Lewis {{spoke about}} his {{concerns}} of how Freasier {{would react to}} the more serious scenes: [...] "I started to worry {{a little bit because}} we were very close, and I thought, 'Man, how's he going to feel when I start treating him harshly?' So I kind of sat him down. I created this sort of atmosphere... portentous atmosphere. 'Dillon, you know how I feel about you and {{there are going to be}} moments...
