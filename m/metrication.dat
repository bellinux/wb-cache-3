5|$|In 1965 Britain {{commenced}} {{an official}} programme of <b>metrication</b> that, , {{had not been}} completed. The British <b>metrication</b> programme signalled the start of <b>metrication</b> programmes elsewhere in the Commonwealth, though India had started its programme in 1959, six years before the United Kingdom. South Africa (then {{not a member of}} the Commonwealth) set up a <b>Metrication</b> Advisory Board in 1967, New Zealand set up its Metric Advisory Board in 1969, Australia passed the Metric Conversion Act in 1970 and Canada appointed a <b>Metrication</b> Commission in 1971. <b>Metrication</b> in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa was essentially complete within a decade, while <b>metrication</b> in India and Canada is not complete. In addition the lakh and crore are still in widespread use in India, while in Canada the square foot is still widespread for commercial and residential advertisements and partially in construction because of the close trade relations with the United States, and the railways of Canada continue to measure their trackage in miles and speed limits in miles per hour because they also operate in the United States. Most other Commonwealth countries adopted the metric system during the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|As the Laws were {{formulated}} in England, and were initially administered solely {{by the four}} British football associations within IFAB, the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in imperial units. The Laws now express dimensions with approximate metric equivalents (followed by traditional units in brackets), though use of imperial units remains popular in English-speaking countries with a relatively recent history of <b>metrication</b> (or only partial <b>metrication),</b> such as Britain.|$|E
5|$|By 1980 all {{apart from}} the United Kingdom, Canada and Ireland had {{effectively}} completed their programs. In the United Kingdom the breakdown of voluntary <b>metrication</b> in the mid-1970s coincided with the United Kingdom's obligations {{as part of the}} EEC to adopt the metric system, resulting in legislation to force <b>metrication</b> in certain areas and the Eurosceptic movement adopting an anti-metrication stance and the United Kingdom seeking a number of derogations from the relevant EEC directives. Once the <b>metrication</b> of most consumer goods was completed in 2000, aspects of British life, especially in government, commerce and industry used SI. Although imperial units are widely encountered in unregulated areas such as the press and everyday speech, SI or units approved for use alongside SI are used in most areas where units of measure are regulated. High-profile exceptions include the sale of draught beer, the sale of milk in returnable containers, and United Kingdom road signs. Irish road signs (road distances and speeds) were converted to metric units during {{the first decade of the}} 21st century; otherwise, the situation in Ireland is similar to that in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the large}} {{expansion}} of the First French Empire under Napoleon I, French <b>metrication</b> also affected what would be (parts of) France's neighbour countries after the Congress of Vienna.|$|E
5|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century the metric system of weights and {{measures}} proved a convenient political compromise during the unification processes in the Netherlands, Germany and Italy. In 1814, Portugal became the first country {{not part of the}} French Empire to officially adopt a metric system. Spain found it expedient in 1858 to follow the French example and within a decade Latin America had also adopted the metric system. There was considerable resistance to <b>metrication</b> in the United Kingdom and in the United States, though once the United Kingdom announced its <b>metrication</b> program in 1965, the Commonwealth followed suit.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{during the}} Ford and Carter administrations to force <b>metrication</b> were seized on by many {{newspaper}} editorialists as being dictatorial. Public response included resistance, apathy, and sometimes ridicule. The underlying {{reasons for this}} response include a relative uniformity of weights and measures (though, notably, US liquid measure differed by about 20% from British Imperial measure, which was adopted throughout the British Empire in 1824) inherited from the United Kingdom in 1776, a homogeneous economy {{and the influence of}} business groups and populists in Congress caused the country to look at the short-term costs associated with the change-over, particularly those that would be borne by the consumer rather than long-term benefits of efficiency and international trade. The <b>Metrication</b> Board was disbanded under President Ronald Reagan's direction in 1982.|$|E
5|$|The Netherlands were {{partially}} metricated {{when they}} were French, in the years 1810–1813. With full <b>metrication,</b> effective January 1821, the Netherlands reformed the trooisch pond. The apothecaries' new pound was 375.00g. Apart from rounding issues concerning the subdivisions, this corresponded exactly to the French système usuel. (The reform was not followed in the north German city of Lübeck, which continued to use the trooisch pond.) In Belgium, apothecaries' weight was metricized effective 1856.|$|E
5|$|When the SI {{standard}} {{was published in}} 1960, the only major Commonwealth country to have adopted the metric system was India. In 1863, the first reading of {{a bill that would}} have made the metric system compulsory passed its first reading in the House of Commons by 110 votes to 75. The bill, however, failed to make the statute book because of lack of parliamentary time. In 1965, after this and similar false starts the then Federation of British Industry informed the British Government that its members favoured the adoption of the metric system. The rationale behind the request was that 80% of British exports were to countries that used the metric system or that were considering changing to the metric system. The Board of Trade, on behalf of the Government, agreed to support a ten-year <b>metrication</b> programme. The government agreed to a voluntary policy requiring minimal legislation and costs to be borne where they fell. SI would be used from the outset. The rest of the Commonwealth, South Africa and Ireland followed within a few years; in some countries such as South Africa and Australia <b>metrication</b> was mandatory rather than voluntary.|$|E
5|$|In 1414, {{six years}} before the Treaty of Troyes, a statute of Henry V of England gave {{directions}} to the goldsmiths {{in terms of the}} troy pound. (In 1304 it had apparently not yet been introduced, since it did not appear in the statute of weights and measures.) There is evidence from the 15th century that the troy pound was used for weighing metals and spices. After the abolishment of the Tower pound in 1527 by Henry VIII of England, the troy pound was the official basis for English coin weights. The British apothecaries' system was based on the troy pound until <b>metrication,</b> and it survived in the United States and Australia well into the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|On 10 February 1964, the National Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology) {{issued a}} {{statement}} that it was to use SI except where this would have an obvious detrimental effect. In 1968 Congress authorised the U.S. Metric Study, the emphasis of which {{was to examine the}} feasibility of adopting SI. The first volume was delivered in 1970. The study recommended that the United States adopt the International System of units, and in 1975 Congress passed the Metric Conversion Act of 1975, which established a national policy of coordinating and planning for the increased use of the metric measurement system in the United States. <b>Metrication</b> was voluntary and to be coordinated by the United States Metric Board (USMB).|$|E
25|$|The retail {{industry}} proved {{difficult for the}} <b>Metrication</b> Board. The sector saw little benefit in <b>metrication</b> – competition was fierce and margins low. The opinions of the trade organisations with which the <b>Metrication</b> Board could negotiate were fragmented.|$|E
25|$|The {{failure to}} appoint the <b>Metrication</b> Board {{at the start}} of the <b>metrication</b> {{programme}} meant that industry had to take the lead in a programme that affected everybody and did not have the machinery to implement <b>metrication</b> in, especially, the retail sector.|$|E
25|$|There was {{no single}} {{approach}} to the <b>metrication</b> of the engineering industry: in some areas soft <b>metrication</b> was applied and in others hard <b>metrication.</b> In certain branches <b>metrication</b> was achieved by adopting the equivalent European or international standard, {{but this was not}} always possible as certain standards, such as BS1363 which defined electric plugs were peculiarly British while the petrochemical industry had standardised on API and ANSI standards.|$|E
25|$|The White Paper was {{published}} in February 1972, and it set out the case for <b>metrication</b> and refuted the charge of <b>metrication</b> by stealth as metric units had been lawful for most purposes since 1897. It also reported that <b>metrication</b> would be necessary for the UK to join the European Common Market and that as British industry was exporting to {{all parts of the}} world they would benefit. It also reiterated the previous government's policy that <b>metrication</b> should be voluntary and hoped <b>metrication</b> would be mostly complete within ten years. The expectation was also expressed that with both the imperial and metric systems coexisting for many years, that consumers would gradually become familiar and comfortable with the metric system.|$|E
25|$|In 1978 {{the cost}} of {{converting}} road signs from miles to kilometres in the United Kingdom {{was estimated to be}} between £7½ and £8½ million (1978 prices). A 2005 report pointed to the <b>metrication</b> of the United Kingdom's two million road signs as the major cost of completing the United Kingdom's <b>metrication</b> programme. The Department for Transport (DfT) costed the replacement of all of the United Kingdom's road signs {{in a short period of}} time at between £565million and £644million. In 2008–09, before the outcome of the consultations that led to the EU directive 2009/3/EC was known, the DfT had a contingency of £746million for the <b>metrication</b> of roads signs. In contrast, the United Kingdom <b>Metrication</b> Association, in a report published in 2006, and using a model based on the Irish road sign <b>metrication</b> programme, estimated {{the cost of}} converting road signs to be £80million, spread over 5 years (or about 0.25% of the annual roads budget).|$|E
25|$|Many {{sectors of}} the {{industry}} did agree to a programme coordinated by the <b>Metrication</b> Board, with <b>metrication</b> of pre-packaged goods being introduced on a commodity by commodity basis. In 1977 when a carpet retailing chain reneged on an industry-wide agreement to use metric units (carpeting at £8.36 per square yard being much more appealing to the customer than carpeting at £10.00 per square metre), it became necessary {{for the first time}} to use legislation to enforce <b>metrication</b> rather than to rely on a voluntary adoption of the system.|$|E
25|$|Consistent with ICAO policy, {{aviation}} {{has undergone}} {{a significant amount of}} <b>metrication</b> over the years. For example, runway lengths are usually given in metres. The United States metricated the data interchange format (METAR) for temperature reports in 1996. <b>Metrication</b> is also gradually taking place in cargo weights and dimensions and in fuel volumes and weights.|$|E
25|$|These sentiments were {{echoed in}} the final report of the <b>Metrication</b> Board.|$|E
25|$|Links in {{the country}} point to {{articles}} about <b>metrication</b> in that country.|$|E
25|$|The {{involvement}} of the European Commission led <b>metrication</b> to be linked in public debate with Euroscepticism, and traditionally Eurosceptic parts of the British press often exaggerating or inventing the extent of enforced <b>metrication.</b> Example stories include the Daily Star, which on 17 January 2001 claimed that beer would soon have to be sold by the litre in pubs, something not demanded in any EU directive.|$|E
25|$|Most jurisdictions use {{the metric}} speed unit of {{kilometers}} per hour for speed limits, while some, primarily the United States and the United Kingdom, use speed limits given in miles per hour. There {{is an ongoing}} discussion {{as to whether they}} should follow the lead of other countries and switch to using metric units (see <b>Metrication</b> in the United Kingdom and <b>Metrication</b> in the United States).|$|E
25|$|Half of {{respondents}} {{were opposed to}} completing <b>metrication,</b> with a quarter supportive and a fifth indifferent or non-committal.|$|E
25|$|This Select Committee {{reported}} in 1907 and a bill was drafted proposing compulsory <b>metrication</b> by 1910, including decimalisation of coinage.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{features}} of the British <b>metrication</b> programme as announced in 1966 was a voluntary adoption of the metric programme with the costs being absorbed where they fell. As a result, the costs and savings of <b>metrication</b> in the United Kingdom have not been comprehensively determined and studies have {{tended to focus on}} specific programmes. The impact of a voluntary programme meant that industry was free to take the most cost-efficient approach, which in many cases has meant installing equipment calibrated in metric units as part of an ongoing maintenance cycle rather than as part of a specific <b>metrication</b> programme. Such an approach was taken by the gas industry where all newly installed meters record usage in cubic metres, but many older installations will measure in cubic feet.|$|E
25|$|Active Resistance to <b>Metrication,</b> {{founded by}} Eurosceptic {{politician}} Tony Bennett, {{is best known}} for its direct action campaign against metric signs.|$|E
25|$|Before the Hodgson Committee, the <b>metrication</b> {{process was}} already in operation. One example was the Ordnance Survey, the {{national}} mapping agency for Great Britain, which initiated the Retriangulation of Great Britain in 1936, using metric measures. A metric National Grid was then {{used as the basis}} for maps published by the Ordnance Survey from World War II onwards, the War Office maps having had a metric grid since 1920. The Ordnance Survey decided on full <b>metrication</b> in 1964. The best-selling 1 inch to the mile range of maps started being replaced with the 1:50000 range in 1969. The <b>metrication</b> of Admiralty Charts began in 1967 as part of a modernisation programme. , road and street maps with primary scales in inches per mile were still being produced by the company Geographers' A–Z Street Atlas.|$|E
25|$|The general {{election}} of 18 June 1970 {{resulted in a}} change of government and four months later, on 27 October 1970, following an anti-metrication motion being tabled calling on the new government not {{to continue with the}} previous government's <b>metrication</b> commitments, the government announced that a White Paper would be produced to examine the cost, savings, advantages and disadvantages of a change to the metric system. During the debate when the announcement was made, Conservative MPs complained that <b>metrication</b> was being introduced by stealth.|$|E
25|$|The Metric System {{was adopted}} under the 1976 <b>Metrication</b> Ordinance. Subsequently, {{many of the}} wet markets and {{traditional}} Chinese medicine shops used the old Chinese system {{for at least another}} decade.|$|E
25|$|Although New Zealand {{completed}} <b>metrication</b> in the 1970s, a {{study of}} university students undertaken in 1992 found a continued use of imperial units for birth weight and human height alongside metric units.|$|E
25|$|Today, the American {{public and}} much of the private {{business}} and industry still use US customary units despite many years of informal or optional <b>metrication.</b> At least two states, Kentucky and California, have even moved towards demetrication of highway construction projects.|$|E
25|$|In Ireland, {{the only}} legal {{exception}} to the <b>metrication</b> process was the pint (redefined as 570ml) in bars, pubs, and clubs (although alcohol sold in any other location is in metric units (usually 330ml (bottled beer), 500ml (canned beer), 750ml (wine), or 1L or 700ml (spirits))).|$|E
25|$|The Decimal Association {{was founded}} in 1841 to promote decimalisation and <b>metrication,</b> both causes that were boosted by a {{realisation}} {{of the importance of}} international trade following the 1851 Great Exhibition. It was {{as a result of the}} growing interest in decimalisation that the florin was issued.|$|E
25|$|Other {{countries}} {{using the}} imperial system completed official <b>metrication</b> {{during the second}} half of the 20th century or the first decade of the 21st century. The most recent to complete this process was the Republic of Ireland, which began metric conversion in the 1970s and completed it in early 2005.|$|E
25|$|In October 2011, the Antigua and Barbuda {{government}} announced the re-launch of the <b>Metrication</b> Programme {{in accordance with}} the Metrology Act 2007, which established the International System of Units as the legal system of units. The Antigua and Barbuda government has committed to a full conversion from the imperial system by the first quarter of 2015.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, {{the then}} Federation of British Industry {{informed}} the British Government that its members favoured {{the adoption of}} the metric system. The Board of Trade, on behalf of the Government, agreed to support a ten-year <b>metrication</b> programme There would be minimal legislation as the programme was to be voluntary and costs were to be borne where they fell.|$|E
25|$|<b>Metrication</b> in the United Kingdom {{began in}} the mid-1960s. Initially this <b>metrication</b> was {{voluntary}} and by 1985 many traditional and imperial units of measure had been voluntarily removed from use in the retail trade. The Weights and Measures Act of 1985 formalized their removal for use in trade, though imperial units were retained for use on road signs and the most common imperial weights such as the foot, inch, pound, ounce, gallon and pint continued {{to be used in}} the retail trade for the sale of loose goods or goods measured or weighed in front of the customer. Since 1 January 2000 it has been unlawful to use imperial units for weights and measures in retail trade in the United Kingdom except as supplementary units or for the sale of draught beer and cider by the pint or milk that is sold in returnable containers.|$|E
