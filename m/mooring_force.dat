40|$|When a ship is {{anchoring}} in {{a stormy}} weather, the anchor often comes off {{due to the}} extreme overload of the <b>mooring</b> <b>force.</b> Then, the ship begins to run and sometimes causes aground, and this makes a serious disaster.

However, the mechanism of anchor <b>mooring</b> <b>force</b> in a stormy weather is complicated and not clear. Although the wind force to the superstructure becomes the major anchor <b>mooring</b> <b>force,</b> it may not be enough even if the wave drifting force is considered. In this paper, the accident of the sail training ship "Kaiwo Maru" that was caused under the stormy weather by the large-scale typhoon off Hushiki-Toyama harbor in 2004 is investigated based on the model tests. Then, it is found that the peak <b>mooring</b> <b>force</b> becomes extremely larger even in the ahead condition against wind and wave when the ship is more strongly pulled by the wind force and wave drifting force. This may causes the some kind of deadlock condition that the windlass can not pull up the anchor but the anchor begins to walk, until at last the above mentioned accident may happen in the stormy weather...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} meet the {{increasing}} requirement of farming fish in more exposed offshore sites, a novel globe-shaped submersible fish cage system with two tension mooring lines has been proposed. In normal sea conditions the cage remains on the surface; during storms the cage can be submerged some distance below the water surface to reduce the wave forces and motions of the cage and hence reduce the forces in the mooring system and the stress on the farmed fish. Since the proposed system is a quite new design concept, few theoretical and experimental results can be found to guide the prototype design. [...] To {{have a better understanding of}} the hydrodynamic performance of the proposed system, qualitative analyses were conducted and a series of resistance tests and moored tests were carried out with two globe-shaped cage models, one spherical and the other geodesic, to study the resistance forces of the cages in currents and the motion and <b>mooring</b> <b>force</b> responses of the cage system in waves. In the resistance tests, three orientations of the cage axle to the current direction were tested. In the moored tests, three submerged positions and three orientations were tested and the effects of pretension and axial stiffness of the mooring lines were investigated in both regular waves and irregular waves. [...] The study shows that the relationship between the current velocity and the resultant resistance force can be interpolated very well with a quadratic equation regressed from the test results. Provided the Reynolds numbers of the cage elements are still within the range of subcritical flow regime, the regressed equation can also be used to extrapolate the resistance force outside the Reynolds number range tested. [...] The study also shows that the method of submerging the cage below the water surface to reduce the motions of the cage and the forces in the mooring system is very effective in deep water waves, but becomes less and less effective in intermediate water waves. The pretension of the mooring lines has little effect on the dynamic <b>mooring</b> <b>force</b> and motion responses of the cage system as long as the mooring lines do not go slack. The stiffness of the mooring lines has a significant effect on the responses of <b>mooring</b> <b>force,</b> heave and roll, but has little effect on the responses of surge and sway. When the cage is perpendicular to the wavefront, the vertical displacement and <b>mooring</b> <b>force</b> on one side of the cage may be significantly larger than those on the other side because of the phase difference between the heave and roll motions of the cage...|$|E

In order to design such a structure, it is essential to evaluate the dynamic response under extreme environmental conditions. In this study; therefore, a dynamic analysis tool has been developed. The dynamic analysis tool consists of a multibody dynamics solver (MSC.

In order to validate the program, comparison with the experimental results, where the wind, current, and wave are applied simultaneously, has been made. In this paper, only parked conditions are considered. The comparison shows that the principal behavior of the floating offshore wind turbine with spar platform has been captured by the developed program. However, when vortex-induced motion (VIM) occurs, the current loads and cross-flow responses (sway and roll) are underestimated by the simulation since the simu-lation code does not account for the effect of VIM.

40|$|AbstractThe {{hydrodynamic}} {{behaviors of}} a floating breakwater {{consisting of a}} rectangular pontoon and horizontal plates are studied theoretically. The fluid motion is idealized as two-dimensional linear potential flow. The motions of the floating breakwater {{are assumed to be}} two-dimensional in sway, heave, and roll. The solution to the fluid motion is derived by transforming the governing differential equation into the integral equation on the boundary in time domain with the Green's function method. The motion equations of the floating breakwater are established and solved with the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method to obtain the displacement and velocity of the breakwater. The mooring forces are computed with the static method. The computational results of the wave transmission coefficient, the motion responses, and the mooring forces of the pontoon-plate floating breakwater are given. It is indicated that the relative width of the pontoon is an important factor influencing the wave transmission coefficient of the floating breakwater. The transmission coefficient decreases obviously as the relative width of the pontoon increases. The horizontal plates help to reduce the wave transmission over the floating breakwater.

40|$|Moored {{ships are}} {{believed}} to be feasible for marine operations in ice-covered waters. A variety of ice features, such as broken ice, level ice, ridged ice and icebergs, will pose potential challenges with respect to design and operations. This thesis presents studies on the actions of level ice on moored ships and the resulting vessel response. Focus was put on both analysing physical measurements and deriving suitable numerical models. The thesis is thus articulated around three parts: analysis of ice failure modes, vessel response and <b>mooring</b> <b>forces</b> from model tests of a concept called the Arctic Tandem O_oading Terminal; analysis of ice <b>forces</b> and <b>mooring</b> <b>forces</b> from model tests of a moored simplified hull; development of methodology for numerical modelling of moored ships in level ice with constant drift direction. A concept for o_oading of hydrocarbons in ice-infested waters was tested in the Large Ice Model Basin at the Hamburg Ship Model Basin (HSVA). The Arctic Tandem offloading Terminal consists of two vessels; a turret moored offloading icebreaker, and a shuttle tanker moored in tandem at the stern of the offloading icebreaker. Studies of the coupled response of both vessels to ice actions and the resulting tandem <b>mooring</b> <b>forces</b> show that the concept was stable in yaw when the ice drift direction changed slowly in level ice. The response of the offloading icebreaker moored alone in level ice with variable drift direction and the corresponding ice failure modes were investigated with both slow and sudden changes of ice drift direction. The study underlines how ice actions and the ice failure modes depend on the relative angle between the ice drift direction and the vessel's heading, the hull shape and the vessel's response. The test campaign showed that with the present concept, the magnitude of the <b>mooring</b> <b>forces</b> in severe ice drift events can be comparable to those experienced in ridges. Actions from level ice with variable drift direction should therefore be considered as a possible design criterion for moored ships in certain areas. Model tests of a moored simplified hull in level ice with constant drift direction have been performed at HSVA. The hull was instrumented to measure the local ice actions on the bow, as well as the <b>mooring</b> <b>forces</b> and the surge response. The test setup enabled studies of the dynamic properties of both ice and <b>mooring</b> <b>forces</b> by independently varying the ice drift speed and the stiffness of the mooring system. Average <b>mooring</b> <b>forces</b> and local ice forces on the bow increased with the ice drift speed, except for the softest mooring system, and were highest for the soft mooring system and lowest for the stiff one at all speeds. A semi-empirical method for modelling local ice forces on the bow was developed based on observations from the model tests. Ice actions are split into actions {{in the vicinity of the}} waterline, caused by breaking of intact ice and rotation of broken ice oes, and actions below the waterline, caused by ice-hull friction. The method is probabilistic and includes speed dependence. Numerical modelling of the surge response of moored ships interacting with intact level ice with constant drift direction was performed with two different approaches for the ice actions: the ice was modelled as an elastic beam on an elastic foundation and applied on a simplified 2 D hull design; the above-mentioned semi-empirical local ice force formulation was implemented and applied on a model of the offloading icebreaker. Ice forces depended on the penetration of the ship into the ice and enabled feedback effects of the surge response on the ice actions. Such effects were mainly present at low ice drift speeds and often induced large <b>mooring</b> <b>forces.</b> The local ice <b>force</b> formulation induced <b>mooring</b> <b>forces</b> comparable to those measured in model tests of the same hull. The author believes that the method is suited for studies of the dynamic response of moored ships in level ice with constant ice drift direction and can be extended to level ice with variable ice drift direction.   PhD i bygg, anlegg og transportPhD in Civil and Transport Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|The {{pursuit of}} energy in Arctic waters drives people to design ocean {{structures}} applying new concepts. Conical structures which shift the ice failure mode from crushing to bending could reduce the total iceload. Moreover, its symmetric geometry naturally achieves the requirement of ice-vaning and {{reduces the risk of}} possible large ice loads induced by the failure of ice-vaning that might be encountered by other shapes of floaters. The thesis is based on the model test results of a group of conical structures in different ice conditions. All the tests were conducted in the Hamburg Ship Model Basin (HSVA) in Germany. The thesis comprises two parts. In the first part, the ice basin test results of the SEVAN FPU-Ice Buoy were analyzed. Based on the test data, the structure’s responses and load transferring characteristics were examined using the computer software Diadem. And the hydrodynamic and hydro-static characteristics were calculated by using Hydro-D. Then this dynamic system was analyzed in the surge direction. Based on the calculation results, explanations concerning the dominant pitch response coinciding with the pitch natural frequency were given in a descriptive way. Furthermore, alow-frequency ice accumulation volume was visually observed. This was thought to be the cause of the dominant low frequency surge displacement. The relationships between different structural responses with different ice load components were also identified. It was pointed out that the surge displacement was mainly influenced by the ice sliding load while pitch displacement was mainly influenced by the ice rotating load. According to the analysis of this system in surge direction, it was further found that the <b>mooring</b> <b>force</b> was mainly to counter balance the ice sliding load while the ice rotating load was mainly counter balanced by the inertia force and <b>mooring</b> <b>force.</b> Furthermore, based on a discussion about level ice-conical structure interaction processes, a numerical model concerning the level ice and moored structure interaction was developed using MATLAB {{in the first part of}} this thesis. The calculation results were compared with the test data. It is found that this numerical model gives good predictions of the surge and heave displacements. And it was also found that the ice accumulation load (a part of ice sliding load) and ventilation load (a part of ice rotatingload) are two major contributors to the total ice load. In the second part, the analysis was based on the test data of five conical structures designed by AkerSolutions. Both moored and fixed structures with different geometries were tested in different ice conditions (level ice, managed ice, and ice ridges) with different ice speeds (0. 1 m/s, 0. 5 m/s and 1 m/sNTNU, Trondheim, Norwayiiat full-scale). Extensive comparisons of the test results in different ice conditions with different ice speeds are discussed in Part II of my thesis.

40|$|Increased {{activity}} in deeper water areas, {{in connection with}} oil and gas exploration, {{has resulted in a}} steadily increased demand for model testing technology to predict reliable behavior of floating offshore structures at deep water. Common model testing technology, developed for more shallow water, must be modified to meet the challenges that deep water model testing poses. The approach using active control of line forces to replace the mooring and riser system seems promising. Actuators should induce the same resulting forces as calculated by numerical methods on to the vessel in real time. This master’s thesis has its focus on the development of an experimental setup to investigate the performance of the control system inducing desired forces on to a simplified vessel model. To simplify the complexity with an experiment using a vessel moving in 6 degrees of freedom (DOF), a simplified vessel model with motion only in the heave direction is considered. Active control of the line force connected to the vessel, moving only in heave direction, is launched to investigate if the actuator or motor-winch system, mange to induce the correct calculated <b>mooring</b> <b>force</b> for a measured heave motion. Necessary procurement of parts to the experimental setup has been obtained. Reasonable values for the maximum and minimum top tension for one mooring line has been used to find an appropriate actuator. A Faulhaber electrical motor was chosen to meet the specifications. The drive electronics controlling the electrical motor has a wide variety of control options, and control of the motor shaft torques, necessary to obtain desired forces, is possible. A mathematical model describing the experimental setup was developed. A model of the DC motor dynamics and the mass dynamics are mathematically derived. The unknown parameters in the model have been found using measurement data from experiment. The measurement data are established using a pretensioned spring connected to the DC motor shaft, as well as a freely running shaft. In the experiments two test cases are considered. In test case one a spring and line, representing the active mooring line, is connected in-between the vessel model, or oscillating actuator, and a motor-winch system. The motor-winch, or DC motor, will then try to pull the line and spring till it reaches the desired reference. The measured heave motion to the oscillating system is utilized to calculate the <b>mooring</b> <b>force</b> references, the active mooring line will then try to induce the same forces as calculated. The calculated forces are only available for a given heave motion. A second test case is performed with a vessel model represented as a mass. The mass, or vessel, is connected to the oscillating system actuator with a spring. The oscillating system actuator will represent the wave motion, while the spring should represent the water plane stiffness. A rope, or line, connected in-between the mass and the motor-winch system will represent the active mooring line. Different sinusoidal references, as well as piecewise constant signals are used to test if the active mooring line is able to induce the desired forces on to the mass real time. The results show that for the given heave motion the motor-winch setup will be able to actuate the desired mooring line forces on to the oscillating body. Sinusoidal force references are also possible to follow. There is however a constraint in the frequency, and a high oscillating system frequency will be a limitation. By decreasing the oscillating frequency less noise in the measured signal will occur. To avoid a lot of noise in the measured forces filtering the signal was necessary. An observer has been developed to remove this noise. The filtered signal (estimated force) can then be used as feedback to the controller. A vessel model considered in three DOF is used to find an appropriate sampling frequency. The real time response measurements to the vessel need to be sampled in order to calculate desired mooring forces. A study is therefore conducted to find the bandwidth, or highest frequency, in the system to conclude which sampling frequency that is needed to recreate the response signals without loss of information. The results show that 50 Hz sampling frequency will be necessary to recreate the continuous time signals for the specific case considered. </p...|$|E
40|$|Yachts {{are built}} to provide guests {{with a unique}} experience. In order to provide this experience, yachts are often {{anchored}} at special locations. Captains prefer to use a single bow anchor when they moor the vessel. Problems are reported {{with respect to the}} availability while yachts are at anchor. These are caused by environmental forces. Availability is the yachting term for the operability of a yacht. The comfort on board and the availability of activities are the main aspects playing a role in the overall availability. Horizontal motions and accelerations of the vessel, respectively caused by wind and waves, are the main issues at anchor. These undesired accelerations can be reduced by controlling the yacht’s heading, ensuring optimal wave interaction. The objective of this research is to improve the availability while at anchor by suppressing the horizontal motions and controlling the heading of the vessel. Previous research suggests that using thrusters is a feasible solution for this. The research performed in this thesis provides a design proposition based on a quasi static analysis. For that reason, mathematical models are developed which are embedded in engineering tools. When these tools are defined, the first step is a parameter study. This has been performed to examine what, theoretically, is the preferred anchor support system. In this study, the required power and <b>mooring</b> <b>force</b> is calculated for a predefined capability. The capability is the environmental condition at which the system is able to be stationary. Based on the results can be concluded that the mooring line has to be located close to the pivot point of the vessel and that the thrusters have to be located with a large distance to the pivot point opposite to the mooring line location. Using multiple thrusters is often preferable because the same thrust can be delivered with less power. However, the thruster located the closest to the mooring line and pivot point delivers little thrust compared to the other thruster located further away. The usage of a tunnel thruster or an azimuth thruster is preferred. The difference between these two is limited because the azimuth thruster operates at an angle θ of 90 degrees. The theoretical solutions found neglect practical aspects which have {{to be taken into account}} for implementation; e. g. the layout of the vessel and the range of the required headings. To consider these aspects, multiple assessment criteria have been defined. The design study has been performed with various design cases. The capability of these cases has been calculated with the developed model in terms of wind speed. When the used power is reduced, the comfort with respect to noise is increased. However, this reduces the capability as well because less thrust can be delivered. The reduction of the capability is related to the power margin to the power 1 / 3, when the thrusters are operating at maximum allowable power. For each design case, the dynamic positioning capability has been calculated to investigate whether including a mooring line influences the capability. As a result of this research can be concluded that the capability of the anchor support systems is higher than the capability of the DP systems and that the anchor support system requires less power to do so. The DP system uses twice as much power for the required range of headings. The design proposition is determined based on the results of the quasi static calculations supported by a multi-criteria analysis. The preferred anchor support system for a yacht has an azimuth stern thruster in front of the platforms at the stern. Placing a thruster below these platforms causes safety issues and reduces the comfort. The yacht is equipped with an azimuth thruster in the bow because such a thruster can provide the same amount of thrust with less power and provides better controllability. The mooring line location is situated in the bow and is located on the centreline, thus an underwater anchor is required. The used approach and developed tools are provided to Feadship which allow them to consider the capability of anchor support system in the early design phase of the new yachts. This gives Feadship the opportunity to build yachts with a higher availability at anchor. As a result, the guests will be able to enjoy an even more unique experience due to the control of horizontal motions. Confidential thesis - Abstract only.

Since it is not cost effective to carry out tests on an actual operating floating dock in the ocean, an alternative solution is to undertake parametric model tests. Very few experiments using a floating dock model have been published. [...] To establish the motion response and <b>mooring</b> <b>forces</b> of a typical floating dock in both regular and irregular waves in beam seas, an experimental program using a 1 : 9 scale model of a moored floating dock has been conducted. For each mooring configuration (free floating, crossed, crossed-connected and non-crossed), tests were undertaken at a 5 : 1 mooring ratio (horizontal distance to water depth) with prototype wave periods of 3 to 15 seconds. In all cases roll, heave and sway motion responses were obtained. The experiments were conducted in a wave tank equipped with a pseudo random wave making facility. To obtain the response amplitude operator (RAO) from the ambient response data, spectral analysis techniques were used. [...] There is very good agreement between regular and irregular wave data. The RAO curves for roll, heave, sway and <b>mooring</b> <b>forces</b> show that the non-crossed mooring configuration should be employed where the situation permits since it will decrease the roll motion and <b>mooring</b> <b>forces</b> with respect to crossed and crossed-connected designs.

A 1 : 100 scale model of 140000 DWT turret moored FPSO system was tested in a 2 m wide wave flume at a water depth of 1 m for the wave frequencies from 0. 55 Hz to 1. 25 Hz in steps of 0. 04 Hz. The motions were measured by rotary type potentiometers and proving ring type load cells were {{used to measure the}} <b>mooring</b> <b>forces.</b> From the analysis of the experimental results, it is found that among the three turret locations, the forward turret position is the best suited position for the internal turret moored FPSO system, so as to have favourable and safe working environment. In this turret location, the surge, heave and pitch motions are about 20 % to 30 % less in comparison with mid ship and semi-aft positions for all loading conditions...|$|R

Model tests indicate that the <b>mooring</b> <b>forces</b> are substantially below those of other floating devices. The device can be moored has not been questioned and consequently {{the manner in which}} this is to be achieved has not had high priority in the past.

40|$|The {{extensive}} {{exploitation of}} the offshore wave energy resource may require the deployment of dense arrays of point absorbers, the distance between elements being possibly tens of meters. In such cases, {{it may be more}} convenient and economical that only elements in the periphery of the array are directly slack-moored to the sea bottom,while the other elements are prevented from drifting and colliding by connections to adjacent elements. Previous work was done in a base configuration of three floating point absorbers located at the grid points of an equilateral triangular, with a solid weight located at the centre of the triangle, which was extended to more complex equilateral triangular grid arrays. The study was based on frequency domain analysis which requires, not only the power take-off system (PTO) to be linear, but also linear <b>mooring</b> <b>forces,</b> which is quite unrealistic as a model of slack moorings. In the present paper those restrictions are removed by using a time-domain, rather than a frequency domain, analysis, which allows nonlinear <b>mooring</b> <b>forces</b> to be considered. The mooring cables are approximately modelled as catenary lines in a quasi-static analysis. The results show very different behaviour for the horizontal and vertical motions of the floating converters, namely the possibility of occurrence of low-frequency horizontal oscillations of large amplitude. Even in the case of incident regular waves, such horizontal motions were found to be non-periodic, a behaviour that is typical of nonlinear systems...|$|R

Numerical results for the motions, mooring demands and also absorbed power by the converter, are presented for the different mooring configurations, for a system consisting of a hemispherical buoy in regular waves and assuming a liner power take-off system...|$|R

These piles are usually subjected {{to a wide range}} of monotonic and cyclic lateral-to-oblique pullout forces.

All piles were jacked into the sand bed in-flight. The pile models were instrumented with strain gauges.

This interaction should be considered in the design of offshore anchor piles...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} a nonlinear mechanical and hydrodynamical model for floating offshore wind turbines. The model employs results from robotics to model the equations of motion. A simple rigid-body turbine model has been implemented. Hydrodynamic forces are modeled in part with the generalized Morison equation, in part with direct integration of the Froude-Krylov pressures. Buoyancy forces are modeled via a non-linear buoyancy scheme that considers variations in water-plane area. <b>Mooring</b> <b>forces</b> are modeled with a real-time numeric solution of the quasi-static catenary equations. Simulation results are presented. Comparison with existing data shows excellent agreement. The model successfully provides a nonlinear time-domain simulation capability for offshore floating wind turbines. </p...|$|R

This paper expatiates {{hydrodynamic}} time-domain {{analysis on}} strategic oil storage vessels in free floating condition or with dolphin-fender mooring system {{by means of}} AQWA numerical software. The results indicate that motion responses of the oil storage vessel with dolphin-fender mooring have improved significantly. The time-history of wave diffraction forces in incident wave direction are basically consistent between the free floating and moored condition. However, in vertical direction of incident wave, the diffraction wave force of the oil storage vessel in free floating condition is obviously different from that with mooring system, {{which is the result}} of the coupling interaction between dolphin and vessels. <b>Mooring</b> <b>forces</b> include fender reaction and cable tension, as for which dominate, it depend on evocable motion responses about incident wave direction...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFloating {{wave energy}} {{converters}} (WECs) {{operating in the}} resonance region are strongly affected by non-linearities arising from {{the interaction between the}} waves, the WEC motion and the mooring restraints. To compute the restrained WEC motion thus requires a method which readily accounts for these effects. This paper presents a method for coupled mooring analysis using a two-phase Navier–Stokes (VOF–RANS) model and a high-order finite element model of mooring cables. The method is validated against experimental measurements of a cylindrical buoy in regular waves, slack-moored with three catenary mooring cables. There is overall a good agreement between experimental and computational results with respect to buoy motions and <b>mooring</b> <b>forces.</b> Most importantly, the coupled numerical model accurately recreates the strong wave height dependence of the response amplitude operators seen in the experiments...|$|R
