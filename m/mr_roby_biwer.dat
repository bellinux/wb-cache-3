5000|$|It {{consists}} of thirteen members, elected every six years by proportional representation. [...] The last elections were held on 9 October 2005, {{and resulted in}} {{a victory for the}} Luxembourg Socialist Workers' Party (LSAP). In the collège échevinal, the LSAP rules outright, under the leadership of mayor <b>Roby</b> <b>Biwer.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} {{interfered}} at all," [...] said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roby.</b> But {{this was a}} lie. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roby</b> had interfered. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roby,</b> in discussing the merits and character of the lover with the young lady, had always lent herself to the lover's aid,--and had condescended to accept from the lover various presents which she could hardly have taken had she been hostile to him.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roby</b> had a husband, but <b>Mr.</b> <b>Roby</b> had {{not been}} asked to dine in the Square on this occasion. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roby</b> dined in the Square very often, but <b>Mr.</b> <b>Roby</b> very seldom,--not {{probably}} above once a year, on some special occasion. He and Mr. Wharton had married sisters, but they were quite unlike in character and had never become friends. Mrs. Wharton had been nearly twenty years younger than her husband; <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roby</b> had been {{six or seven years}} younger than her sister; and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Roby</b> was a year or two younger than his wife. The two men therefore belonged to different periods of life, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Roby</b> at the present time being a florid youth of forty. He had a moderate fortune, inherited from his mother, of which he was sufficiently careful; but he loved races, and read sporting papers; he was addicted to hunting and billiards; he shot pigeons, and,--so Mr. Wharton had declared calumniously more than once to an intimate friend,--had not an H in his vocabulary. The poor man did drop an aspirate now and again; but he knew his defect and strove hard, and with fair average success, to overcome it. But Mr. Wharton did not love him, and they were not friends. Perhaps neither did <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roby</b> love him very ardently. She was at any rate almost always willing to leave her own house to come to the Square, and on such occasions <b>Mr.</b> <b>Roby</b> was always willing to dine at the Nimrod, the club which it delighted him to frequent.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh indeed. And {{what does}} <b>Mr.</b> <b>Roby</b> think about it, I wonder? But I dare {{say you have}} found, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roby,</b> that when a crisis comes,--a real crisis,--the ladies are told nothing. I have." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ferdinand Lopez learned {{immediately}} through <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roby</b> {{that the}} early departure for Herefordshire had been fixed. [...] "I should go to him and speak to him very plainly," [...] said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roby.</b> [...] "He can't bite you." ...|$|R
60|$|Neither at dinner, on {{that evening}} at Manchester Square, nor after dinner, {{as long as}} <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roby</b> {{remained}} in the house, was a word said about Lopez by Mr. Wharton. He remained longer than usual with his bottle of port wine in the dining-room; and when he went upstairs, he sat himself down and fell asleep, almost without a sign. He {{did not ask for}} a song, nor did Emily offer to sing. But as soon as <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roby</b> was gone,--and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roby</b> went home, round the corner, somewhat earlier than usual,--then Mr. Wharton woke up instantly and made inquiry of his daughter.|$|R
60|$|All this time, while Colonel Brace was {{indulging in}} his garrulous comments, the Duke of Bellamont was drawing his moral. He {{had a great}} opinion of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Roby,</b> who was the medical {{attendant}} of the castle, and an able man. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Roby</b> was perfectly acquainted with the constitution of his son; <b>Mr.</b> <b>Roby</b> {{must go to the}} Holy Sepulchre. Cost what it might, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Roby</b> must be sent to Jerusalem. The duke was calculating all this time the income that <b>Mr.</b> <b>Roby</b> made. He would not put it down at more than five hundred pounds per annum, and a third of that was certainly afforded by the castle. The duke determined to offer Roby a thousand and his expenses to attend Lord Montacute. He would not be more than a year absent, and his practice could hardly seriously suffer while away, backed as he would be, when he returned, by the castle. And if it did, the duke must guarantee Roby against loss; it was a necessity, absolute and of the first class, that Tancred should be attended by a medical man who knew his constitution. The duke agreed with Colonel Brace that it was half the battle.|$|R
6000|$|... "It will pretty nearly {{break them}} up," [...] said Sir Orlando Drought, one of Mr. Daubeny's late Secretaries of State to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Roby,</b> <b>Mr.</b> Daubeny's late {{patronage}} secretary.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{knew that}} {{she said she would}} come," [...] replied Emily very sternly, so that <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roby</b> found herself {{compelled}} to pass on to some other subject. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roby</b> had heard the wish expressed that something [...] "once more might be bright," [...] and when she got home told her husband that she was sure that Emily Lopez was going to marry Arthur Fletcher. [...] "And why the d---- shouldn't she?" [...] said Dick. [...] "And that poor man destroying himself not much more than twelve months ago! I couldn't do it," [...] said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roby.</b> [...] "I don't mean to give you the chance," [...] said Dick.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Roby</b> {{replied that}} there were plenty {{to be found in}} London of all kinds.|$|R
6000|$|There {{were two}} or three persons who {{attempted}} to see her at this period, but she avoided them all. First came <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roby,</b> who, as her nearest neighbour, as her aunt, and as an aunt who had been so nearly allied to her, had almost a right to demand admittance. But she would not see <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roby.</b> She sent down word {{to say that she}} was too ill. And when <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roby</b> wrote to her, she got her father to answer the notes. [...] "You had better let it drop," [...] the old man said at last to his sister-in-law. [...] "Of course she remembers that it was you who brought them together." ...|$|R
60|$|Captain Wopper {{concluded}} {{by placing}} a small but heavy canvas bag, and a much-soiled letter, in <b>Mrs</b> <b>Roby's</b> lap.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Roby</b> {{offered a}} prompt {{solution}} of this difficulty {{by suggesting that}} William should divide the money between them.|$|R
60|$|We {{are back}} again in London--in <b>Mrs</b> <b>Roby's</b> little cabin {{at the top}} of the old {{tenement}} in Grubb's Court.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Roby</b> {{told him}} that it was in a street not far from where they sat, in a rather poor lodging.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor {{the picturesque}} {{imagination}} of Mr. Daubeny," [...] said <b>Mr.</b> <b>Roby,</b> feeling himself bound {{to support the}} character of his late chief.|$|R
60|$|Gillie {{appeared}} in a few seconds, nodded patronisingly to old <b>Mrs</b> <b>Roby,</b> hoped she was salubrious, and demanded {{to know what was}} up.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh;--if Mr. Wharton wishes it;--of course." [...] That evening <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roby</b> told Dick Roby, her husband, what an {{old fool}} Mr. Wharton was.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{the less}} {{a friend to}} the poor on that account," [...] thought Captain Wopper; but he said nothing, and <b>Mrs</b> <b>Roby</b> went on:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder whether}} it's true that Sir Orlando {{complained to the}} Duke {{that he was not}} asked to dinner?" [...] said <b>Mr.</b> <b>Roby</b> to <b>Mr.</b> Rattler.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] thought <b>Mrs</b> <b>Roby,</b> {{with a sigh}} of relief; [...] "the fire {{must have}} been a dream after all! but what a vivid one!" ...|$|R
6000|$|On {{the morning}} in question, <b>Mrs</b> <b>Roby,</b> lying placidly in her neat white little bed, and gazing with a sweet {{contented}} face through one of her cabin windows at the bright blue sky, heard a sound as though a compound animal--hog and whale--had aroused itself and rolled over on its other side. A low whistling followed. <b>Mrs</b> <b>Roby</b> knew that the Captain was pleasantly engaged with his thoughts--planning out {{the proceedings of the}} day. Suddenly the whistling ceased and was followed by a sonorous [...] "how-ho!" [...] terminating in a gasp worthy of an express locomotive. The Captain had stretched himself and <b>Mrs</b> <b>Roby</b> smiled at her own thoughts, as well she might for they embraced the idea that a twentieth part of the force employed in that stretch would have rent in twain every tendon, muscle, sinew, and filament in her, <b>Mrs</b> <b>Roby's,</b> body. Next, there descended on the floor overhead a sixteen-stone cannon ball, which caused--not the neighbours, but the boards and rafters to complain. The Captain was up! and succeeding sounds proved that he had had another stretch, for there was a bump {{in the middle of it}} which showed that, forgetting his stature, the careless man had hit the ceiling with his head. That was evidently a matter of no consequence.|$|R
60|$|But Sir Orlando, when he {{commenced}} {{the proceedings}} consequent on this resolution, {{did not find}} all that support which he had expected. Unfortunately {{there had been an}} uncomfortable word or two between him and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Roby,</b> the political Secretary at the Admiralty. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Roby</b> had never quite seconded Sir Orlando's ardour in that matter of the four ships, and Sir Orlando in his pride of place had ventured to snub <b>Mr.</b> <b>Roby.</b> Now <b>Mr.</b> <b>Roby</b> could bear a snubbing perhaps as well as any other official subordinate,--but he was one who would study the question and assure himself that it was, or that it was not, worth his while to bear it. He, too, had discussed with his friends the condition of the Coalition, and had come to conclusions rather adverse to Sir Orlando than otherwise. When, therefore, the First Secretary sounded him as to the expediency of some step {{in the direction of a}} firmer political combination than that at present existing,--by which of course was meant the dethronement of the present Prime Minister,--Mr. Roby had snubbed him! Then there had been slight official criminations and recriminations, till a state of things had come to pass which almost justified the statement made by the Duchess to Mrs. Finn.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look {{how they}} were treated!" [...] said <b>Mr.</b> <b>Roby.</b> [...] "Was it likely {{that they should be}} very staunch when Mr. Monk became Leader of the House?" ...|$|R
6000|$|There had, however, been a {{few words}} spoken on the subject between <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roby</b> and her niece which had served to prepare Emily for what was coming. [...] "Lopez has been to your father," [...] said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roby,</b> in a voice not {{specially}} encouraging for such an occasion. Then she paused a moment; but her niece said nothing, and she continued, [...] "Yes,--and your father has been blaming me,--as if I had done anything! If he did not mean you to choose for yourself, why didn't he keep a closer look-out?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Need we {{say that}} Captain Wopper stuck to <b>Mrs</b> <b>Roby</b> and the [...] "new cabin" [...] to the last? Many and {{powerful}} {{efforts were made to}} induce him to bring his [...] "mother" [...] to dwell in Kensington, but <b>Mrs</b> <b>Roby</b> flatly refused to move again under any suasion less powerful than that of a fire. The eldest of Lewis Stoutley's boys therefore hit on a plan for frequent and easy inter-communication. He one day suggested the idea of a boating-club to his brothers and companions. The proposal was received with wild enthusiasm. The club was established, and a boathouse, with all its nautical appurtenances, was built under the very shadow of <b>Mrs</b> <b>Roby's</b> dwelling. A trusty [...] "diamond" [...] from Grubb's Court was made boat-cleaner and repairer and guardian of the keys, and Captain Wopper was created superintendent general director, chairman, honorary member, and perpetual grand master of the club, in which varied offices he continued to give unlimited satisfaction {{to the end of his}} days.|$|R
6000|$|One morning Captain Wopper got up {{a little}} earlier than usual, and {{began a series of}} {{performances}} which <b>Mrs</b> <b>Roby</b> had long ago styled [...] "rampadgin" [...] round his garret.|$|R
60|$|Expressing a {{hope that}} Susan would keep <b>Mrs</b> <b>Roby</b> company till he returned, the Captain left the room with his usual heavy roll, and the spider {{followed}} with imitative swagger.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mr.</b> <b>Roby</b> senior, having {{escaped from}} the House, was of course the last, and had indeed kept all the other guests waiting half-an-hour,--as becomes a {{parliamentary}} magnate {{in the heat of}} the Session. Mr. Wharton, who had been early, saw all the other guests arrive, and among them Mr. Ferdinand Lopez. There was also Mr. Mills Happerton,--partner in Hunky and Sons,--with his wife, respecting whom Mr. Wharton at once concluded that he was there as being the friend of Ferdinand Lopez. If so, how much influence must Ferdinand Lopez have in that house! Nevertheless, Mr. Mills Happerton was in his way a great man, and a credit to <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roby.</b> And there were Sir Damask and Lady Monogram, who were people moving quite in the first circles. Sir Damask shot pigeons, and so did also Dick Roby,--whence had perhaps arisen an intimacy. But Lady Monogram was not at all a person to dine with <b>Mrs.</b> Dick <b>Roby</b> without other cause than this. But a great official among one's acquaintance can do so much for one! It was probable that Lady Monogram's presence was among the first fruits of the happy family reconciliation that had taken place. Then there was Mrs. Leslie, a pretty widow, rather poor, who was glad to receive civilities from <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roby,</b> and was Emily Wharton's pet aversion. Mrs. Leslie had said impertinent things to her about Ferdinand Lopez, and she had snubbed Mrs. Leslie. But Mrs. Leslie was serviceable to <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roby,</b> and had now been asked to her great dinner party.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's {{only one}} way of getting over them," [...] said <b>Mrs</b> <b>Roby,</b> [...] "and that is, by bringin' the young people together, and givin' 'em a chance to fall in love." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "None whatever, Captain," [...] replied <b>Mrs</b> <b>Roby,</b> with a {{pleasant}} smile, [...] "an {{old friend of}} William may call me whatever he pleases--short," [...] she added after momentary pause, [...] "of swearin'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course we'll come," [...] <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Roby</b> {{had said}} {{to her when she}} went round the corner into Berkeley Street early in the day. [...] "Lopez spoke to me about it before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Advise him," [...] replied <b>Mrs</b> <b>Roby,</b> promptly, [...] "to {{give all}} the money to Dr Lawrence, and get Dr Lawrence to marry Miss Gray, and so they'll both get the whole of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Goin' abroad, sir!" [...] exclaimed <b>Mrs</b> <b>Roby</b> in surprise, for the Captain {{had not yet}} {{told her}} that Lawrence was {{to be of the}} party, {{although}} he had mentioned about himself and Gillie White.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Roby</b> was convinced. She gave in, {{and lived}} {{for many years}} {{afterwards}} in the full enjoyment of the double blessing which had thus fallen to her lot in the evening of her days.|$|R
60|$|<b>Mrs</b> <b>Roby</b> {{pointed to}} a chair and begged Captain Wopper to sit down, which he did after bestowing a {{somewhat}} pointed glance at the chair, {{as if to make}} sure that it could bear him.|$|R
