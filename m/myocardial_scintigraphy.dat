The aim of this retrospective study is to investigate the relationship between these risk factors for coronary artery disease and gated <b>myocardial</b> perfusion <b>scintigraphy</b> findings. Methodology: Two hundred fifty-three (144 women, 109 men) referred to our clinic without a previously known coronary artery disease were included to this study. The mean age of the patients was 57. 42 ± 10. 71 years. Major cardiovascular risk factors (age, gender, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, smoking, family history) were investigated. Statistical analysis of the relationship between risk factors for coronary artery disease and <b>myocardial</b> perfusion <b>scintigraphy</b> findings was performed using SPSS 15. 0.

In the present study, examinations were performed to clarify (1) the proportion of cardiac sympathetic nerve disturbance in Parkinson's disease, (2) the usefulness of 123 I-MIBG <b>myocardial</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> to detect sympathetic nerve disturbances compared with autonomic function tests, (3) cardiac function in patients who have a decreased MIBG uptake in 123 I-MIBG <b>myocardial</b> <b>scintigraphy,</b> (4) the usefulness of 123 I-MIBG <b>myocardial</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> to differentiate Parkinson's disease from the other neurological diseases mimicking it.  METHODS— 123 I-MIBG <b>myocardial</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> was performed, together with autonomic function tests and cardiac examinations in 46 patients with Parkinson's disease and 25 patients with vascular parkinsonism, essential tremor, or multiple system atrophy.  RESULTS—In an anterior image study, the average count per pixel in heart to mediastinum (H/M) ratio decreased in 80 % of the patients with Parkinson's disease in the early phase and 84 % in the late phase. The mean H/M ratio in Parkinson's disease was significantly lower than that in controls and the other diseases. The H/M ratio tended to decrease with the disease progression. In {{almost half of the}} patients in Hoehn and Yahr stage I, the H/M ratio was already decreased. The sympathetic skin response in upper and lower limbs, head up tilt test, and coefficient of variation of R-R interval were abnormal in 17 %, 31 %, 30 %, and 17 % of the patients, respectively. All the patients with abnormal autonomic functions were in Hoehn and Yahr stage III, IV, or V. Echocardiography showed normal left ventricular function.

Methods: This prospective longitudinal study included 30 {{patients with a}} clinical diagnosis of DLB and 29 patients with non-DLB dementia (Alzheimer disease, n = 16; behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, n = 13). All patients underwent 123 I-FP-CIT SPECT and 123 I-MIBG <b>myocardial</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> {{within a few weeks}} of clinical diagnosis. All diagnoses at each center were agreed upon by the local clinician and an independent expert, both unaware of imaging data, and re-evaluated after 12 months. Each image was visually classified as either normal or abnormal by 3 independent nuclear physicians blinded to patients' clinical data. Results: Overall, sensitivity and specificity to DLB were respectively 93 % and 100 % for 123 I-MIBG <b>myocardial</b> <b>scintigraphy,</b> and 90 % and 76 % for 123 I-FP-CIT SPECT. Lower specificity of striatal compared to myocardial imaging was due to decreased 123 I-FP-CIT uptake in 7 non-DLB subjects (3 with concomitant parkinsonism) who had normal 123 I-MIBG myocardial uptake. Notably, in our non-DLB group, myocardial imaging gave no false-positive readings even in those subjects (n = 7) with concurrent medical illnesses (diabetes and/or heart disease) supposed to potentially interfere with 123 I-MIBG uptake. Interpretation: 123 I-FP-CIT SPECT and 123 I-MIBG <b>myocardial</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> have similar sensitivity for detecting DLB, but the latter appears to be more specific for excluding non-DLB dementias, especially when parkinsonism is the only “core feature” exhibited by the patient.

40|$|Background: Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the leading cause of death after kidney transplant. Screening for {{coronary}} artery disease is integral to pretransplant evaluation, although the relative performance of different tests is uncertain. Study Design: Systematic review of diagnostic test accuracy studies using hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic analysis. Setting & Population: Kidney transplant candidates undergoing pretransplant assessment. Selection Criteria of Studies: Studies evaluating the accuracy of screening tests for detecting coronary artery disease. Index Tests: Any non- or minimally invasive test used to diagnose coronary artery disease. Reference Test: Coronary angiography. Results: 11 studies (690 participants) evaluated dobutamine stress echocardiography; 7 (317 participants), myocardial perfusion scintigraphy; 2 (129 participants), exercise stress electrocardiography; and 2 (121 participants), other tests. Dobutamine stress echocardiography had pooled sensitivity of 0. 80 (95 % CI, 0. 64 - 0. 90) and specificity of 0. 89 (95 % CI, 0. 79 - 0. 94). <b>Myocardial</b> perfusion <b>scintigraphy</b> had pooled sensitivity of 0. 69 (95 % CI, 0. 48 - 0. 85) and specificity of 0. 77 (95 % CI, 0. 59 - 0. 89). Head-to-head comparison of dobutamine stress echocardiography and <b>myocardial</b> perfusion <b>scintigraphy</b> (2 studies; 116 participants) showed that dobutamine stress echocardiography had higher specificity and at least equivalent or higher sensitivity. Indirect comparison suggested dobutamine stress echocardiography may have improved accuracy over <b>myocardial</b> perfusion <b>scintigraphy</b> (P = 0. 07). Limitations: Power to detect differences in accuracy between tests is limited due to sparse data.

MethodsWe performed a systematic review of the literature to identify the use of MIBG <b>myocardial</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> in relation to the constellation of pre-motor symptoms in PD.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Modern {{diagnostic}} {{strategy in}} {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD) makes it necessary not only to establish a dia gnosis but also to assess the cardiovascular risk. It is not clear which strategy should be followed {{in the case of}} women with positive ECG stress test results to assess prognosis and start appropriate diagnostics and treatment. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess the prognostic value of <b>myocardial</b> perfusion <b>scintigraphy</b> in comparison with coronary angiography in women suspected of CAD and with positive ECG stress test results. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study population comprised 115 women (mean age 58. 08 ± 8. 8 years) suspected of CAD, with a history of chest pain and positive stress test results, who under The prognostic value of <b>myocardial</b> perfusion <b>scintigraphy</b> compared to coronary angiography in women with positive stress test result...|$|R
30|$|A low {{incidence}} of electrocardiogram (ECG) changes indicating ischemia during weaning {{has been reported}} in a general ICU population [59 – 61]. However, this method suffers from a lack of sensitivity. Indeed, LV wall motion abnormalities occurring or worsening during weaning from mechanical ventilation, detected by <b>myocardial</b> perfusion <b>scintigraphy</b> studies, have been documented without concomitant ECG changes [6, 62].|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the leading cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the elderly. The evaluation of coronary artery disease by exercise stress testing is frequently limited by the patient's inability to exercise. Although pharmacologic stress testing with dobutamine is an alternative, the safety of dobutamine <b>myocardial</b> perfusion <b>scintigraphy</b> in the elderly has not been previously studied. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied the safety and feasibility of dobutamine (up to 40 microg/kg/min) -atropine (up to 1 mg) stress <b>myocardial</b> perfusion <b>scintigraphy</b> using technetium single-photon emission CT imaging in 227 patients > or = 70 years old (mean +/- SD age, 75 +/- 4 years). A control group of 227 patients 20 mm Hg during the test (37 % vs 12 %; p < 0. 05). The test was terminated due to hypotension in 2 % of the elderly patients and in 1 % of the control group. Age was the most powerful predictor of hypotension (p < 0. 005; chi(2), 10. 3). The test was considered feasible in 216 elderly patients (95 %) and in 209 patients of the control group (92 %). CONCLUSION: Dobutamine-atropine stress <b>myocardial</b> perfusion <b>scintigraphy</b> is a highly feasible method for the evaluation of coronary artery disease in the elderly. Elderly patients have a higher risk for developing hypotension and supraventricular tachyarrhythmias during a dobutamine stress test. However, dobutamine-induced hypotension is often asymptomatic and rarely necessitates the termination of the test...|$|R
