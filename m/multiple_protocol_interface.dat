50|$|Languages {{that allow}} only single inheritance, where a class can only derive from one base class, {{do not have}} the diamond problem. The {{reason for this is that}} such {{languages}} have at most one implementation of any method at any level in the inheritance chain regardless of the repetition or placement of methods. Typically these languages allow classes to implement <b>multiple</b> <b>protocols,</b> called <b>interfaces</b> in Java. These protocols define methods but do not provide concrete implementations. This strategy has been used by ActionScript, C#, D, Java, Nemerle, Object Pascal (Delphi), Objective-C, Smalltalk, Swift and PHP. All but Smalltalk allow classes to implement <b>multiple</b> <b>protocols.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Many {{previous}} studies {{have pointed out that}} in the directory based cache coherent multiprocessors protocol processing happens to be a bottleneck and having <b>multiple</b> <b>protocol</b> engines per memory controller increases the throughput of the machines sometimes almost linearly. In this project we modeled a distributed shared memory (DSM) multiprocessor with <b>multiple</b> <b>protocol</b> engines and run memory intensive micro benchmarks on it to see if protocol processing is actually a bottleneck. We implemented a dynamic address partitioning scheme for selecting protocol engines. We wanted to check the claims about the increased throughputs due to <b>multiple</b> <b>protocol</b> processors. Also we wanted to check the levels of load balancing achieved. The simulation results showed almost no improvement in execution times. Also, the time spent in protocol handling was very less which suggested that there is no bottleneck in protocol processing...|$|R

50|$|An EtherType {{field in}} each frame {{is used by}} the {{operating}} system on the receiving station to select the appropriate protocol module (e.g., an Internet Protocol version such as IPv4). Ethernet frames are said to be self-identifying, because of the frame type.

5000|$|Another driver type is NDIS Intermediate Driver. Intermediate drivers sit {{in-between}} the MAC and IP {{layers and}} can control all traffic being {{accepted by the}} NIC. In practice, intermediate drivers implement both miniport and <b>protocol</b> <b>interfaces.</b> The miniport driver and protocol driver actually communicate with the corresponding miniport and <b>protocol</b> <b>interfaces</b> that reside in the intermediate driver. This design enables adding several chained intermediate drivers between the miniport and protocol drivers. Therefore, driver vendors cannot assume that the interface that they send traffic to is implemented by the last driver in the chain. In order to write applications using NDIS one can use samples that accompany Microsoft's Windows Driver Kit (WDK). The [...] "PassThru" [...] sample is {{a good starting point}} for intermediate drivers as it implements all the necessary details required in this driver type, but just passes the traffic through to the next driver in the chain.|$|R
