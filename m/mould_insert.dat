5000|$|The glass {{exhibits}} {{a change in}} refractive index, called index drop, during the annealing process. This drop is caused by fast cooling of the <b>mould</b> <b>insert,</b> inducing {{a small amount of}} residual stress in the glass. As a result, the glass {{exhibits a}} small index change when compared to its fine anneal state. The index drop is small (usually [...]002-.006), but the optical design needs to be optimized to compensate for this change. As an example, the index drop for different glass types is displayed in the picture on the right for different annealing rates. Note that the annealing rate is not necessarily constant during the cooling process. Typical “average” annealing rates for precision molding are between 1000 K/h and 10,000 K/h (or higher). Not only the refractive index, but also the Abbe-number of the glass is changed due to fast annealing. The shown points in the picture on the right indicate an annealing rate of 3500k/h.|$|E
5000|$|Grinding: Grinding or finish-machining {{creates the}} final {{form and the}} surface finish of the cavity in the <b>mould</b> <b>insert.</b> Usually, the finish is carried out by grinding; a {{subsequent}} polishing step is optionally required. Finish grinding can require several changes of the grinding tool and several truing steps of the tool. Finish-machining of the mould is an iterative process: As long as the machined mould shows deviations from the nominal contour in the measurement step after grinding, {{it has to be}} reground. There is no well-defined border between pre-machining and fine grinding. Throughout the grinding process of the cavity, the grain size of the tool, the feed rate and the cutting depth are reduced whereas machining time increases. Convex surfaces are easier to manufacture. The necessary steps of workpiece preparation are the mould alignment and the mould referencing. Grinding tool alignment, grinding tool referencing and grinding tool truing also have to be done. After that polishing can be necessary to remove the anisotropic structure which remains after grinding. It can be performed manually or by a CNC-machine.|$|E

The performance of the developed method was evaluated by fabricating aspherical <b>mould</b> <b>inserts</b> on cemented tungsten carbide.

On the other hand, if there exists appropriate material for prototype production, physics of prototype production is different than of for e. g. injection moulding.

Among the candidates, layer manufacturing (LM) technologies {{appear to be a}} potential solution [Plam, 2002, and Grimm, 2004]. Recent LM technologies have led to a demanding application for developing production tools to manufacture parts, known as rapid tooling (RT). Selective laser sintering (SLS) {{is one of the leading}} LM systems available today in RT to manufacture injection <b>mould</b> (core/cavity) <b>inserts</b> [Kruth, 1998, Chua, 1999, Dormal, 1999, and Grenda, 2005]. However, the current capabilities of the SLS in producing metal parts have not yet fulfil the requirements of the injection <b>mould</b> <b>inserts,</b> especially in dimensional accuracy and surface finish quality [Francis, 2002 and Dalgamo, 2001 a]. The aim of this research is to use indirect SLS and high speed machining (HSM) in developing production-quality plastic injection <b>moulding</b> (core/cavity) <b>inserts.</b> The idea is that the indirect SLS process is utilised to build a near-net-shape inserts, while HSM is then utilised to finish the inserts to production specifications. Benchmark studies have been carried out to characterise the capabilities of both SLS and HSM with reference to the typical requirements of injection <b>mould</b> <b>inserts.</b> Utilising the study results, new developments of the <b>mould</b> <b>inserts</b> have been implemented on three major industrial case studies. Their performances have been evaluated and measured by comparing them with its respective original inserts. Furthermore, a set of design rules has been derived from best practices of the case studies, and have been validated by developing a new design for each case studies inserts. The results have demonstrated that the indirect SLS process has a capability III manufacturing a near-net shape of the insert which requires further related finishing to achieve final production specifications. The insert performances in some case studies have indicated significant improvements in process productivity and energy consumption as well as economic benefits to using the inserts. Regarding the significant considerations in realising the design, a recommendation on further strategic design rules and manufacturing process are highlighted so that the development of the insert using the selected approach can be more effective and efficient. Moreover, a utilisation of computer analysis software and further durability trial is also highlighted in order to predict and evaluate the optimum overall performance.

It is also available at: [URL] demand for productivity and shape complexity on the injection moulding industry necessitates new research to improve tool design, material, and manufacturing. A research field is the development of functionally graded materials (FGMs) to build injection moulds. For example, moulds built with the FGMs technique can have distinctive regions with higher heat conduction. Higher rates of heat transfers from thicker regions of the injected part can be useful to produce better and cheaper injection moulded polymer parts. It is possible to obtain moulds with differential conductivity by adding locally, during the fabrication of the mould, copper to the mould base material such as tool steel. In this work, an investigation into the effect of FGM copper (Cu) -tool steel <b>mould</b> <b>insert</b> over polymer injected parts is presented. The work is divided in two parts: a numerical thermal analysis comparison between Cu-tool steel graded and tool steel inserts and an injection moulding experiment with comparisons between mould surface temperature and degree of crystallinity of polypropylene parts. The numerical model was used to compare different behaviour of the mould heat transfer according to the <b>mould</b> <b>insert</b> material. Thereafter, a bolster was built to hold FGMs and tool steel inserts obtained by a selective laser fusion process. Polypropylene was injected over the inserts to compare with the numeric results. To observe the effect of the cooling rate in the polypropylene parts using the graded inserts, the degree of crystallinity of the parts was measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) test. The temperature of the mould was also evaluated during the injection cycles. The results showed that the graded Cu-tool steel inserts tested had lower capacity to store heat energy.
