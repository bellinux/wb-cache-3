Most corporations have deployed wireless PBXs at the departmental level. However, the mobility management mecha-nism that integrates these facilities at the corporation level {{may not be}} available. This paper describes a mobility management mecha-nism for an enterprise wireless telephone network. We show how to modify the call model of the private branch exchange (PBX) to accommodate mobility management for an enterprise network. Our design was implemented on a commercial PBX product called Jupiter. An analytical model is proposed to evaluate the perfor-mance of the implemented system. Our study shows that {{with a large number}} of WPBXs and long Internet message delays, the <b>mis-routing</b> probability can be limited to within 1 %. This performance result is considered satisfactory. Index Terms—Handset call routing, mobility management, reg-istration, wireless PBX. I...|$|E
40|$|Primary sensory neurons in the {{vertebrate}} olfactory {{systems are}} characterised by the differential expression of distinct cell surface carbohydrates. We show {{here that the}} histo-blood group H carbohydrate is expressed by primary sensory neurons in both the main and accessory olfactory systems while the blood group A carbohydrate is expressed by a subset of vomeronasal neurons in the developing accessory olfactory system. We have used both loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches to manipulate expression of these carbohydrates in the olfactory system. In null mutant mice lacking the a(1, 2) fucosyltransferase FUT 1, the absence of blood group H carbohydrate resulted in the delayed maturation of the glomerular layer of the main olfactory bulb. In addition, ubiquitous expression of blood group A on olfactory axons in gain-of-function transgenic mice caused <b>mis-routing</b> of axons in the glomerular layer of the main olfactory bulb and led to exuberant growth of vomeronasal axons in the accessory olfactory bulb. These results provide in vivo evidence for a role of specific cell surface carbohydrates during development of the olfactory nerve pathways. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNetrin- 1 was {{previously}} {{shown to be}} required for the tangential migration and survival of neurons that will form the inferior olivary nucleus (ION). Surprisingly, the compared analysis of mutant mice lacking either Netrin- 1 or its major receptor DCC reveals striking phenotypic differences besides common features. Although ectopic stops of ION cell bodies occur in the same positions along the migratory stream in both mutants, the ION neurons' number is not affected {{by the lack of}} DCC whereas it is reduced in Netrin- 1 mutant mice. Thus, cell death results from the absence of Netrin- 1 and not from neuron <b>mis-routing,</b> arguing for a role of Netrin- 1 as a survival factor in vivo. The secretion of Netrin- 1 by the floor plate (FP) is strictly required - whereas DCC is not - to avoid ION axons' repulsion by the FP and allows them to cross it. Leading processes of neurons of other caudal precerebellar nuclei (PCN) cannot cross the FP in either mutant mouse, suggesting differential sensitivity or mechanism of action of Netrin- 1 for leading processes of ION and other PCN neurons...|$|E
50|$|This {{happens with}} the popular {{throw-out}} deployment system where the pilot chute does not pull the pin and open the container or once opened does not exert enough force to extract the deployment bag from the container. It {{can be caused by}} pilot chutes with kill lines that have not been cocked during packing or where the kill line has shrunk through use and reduces the drag of the pilot chute. It can be caused by a <b>mis-routed</b> pilot chute bridle. It can also be caused by too large a deployment bag and canopy for the container, although deployment bags should be matched to the containers. The correct procedure with this malfunction is to deploy the reserve from a stable belly down position. If time permits, the skydiver might first attempt to bump their container to dislodge a trapped deployment bag. If this malfunction is temporary and clears, it is called a pilot chute hesitation.|$|R
50|$|On February 12, 2010, a Red Line train derailed at 10:13 am as it {{left the}} Farragut North Station near {{downtown}} Washington. After leaving the station, the train entered a pocket track. As it continued, an automatic derailer {{at the end of}} the pocket track intentionally derailed the train as a safety measure. The front wheels of the first car in the six-car, White Flint-bound train were forced off the tracks, stopping the train. Almost all of the estimated 345 passengers were evacuated from the damaged train by 11:50 am The evacuation was completed by moving passengers into the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cars of the consist, decoupling the cars from the lead pair, and then running the remaining four cars back to Farragut North station. The lead pair was left in the tunnel. The train was apparently <b>mis-routed</b> into the pocket. Central Control attempted to align a route back onto the main line but could not clear the signal. The operator, who was newly returned to service from an extended leave, was told to run past the red signal. Neither she nor the supervisor who ordered her to move the train were aware there was a derailer present at that location, or that it had to be moved to allow the signal to clear. The NTSB arrived on the scene by 12:00 pm Two minor injuries were reported, and a third passenger was taken to George Washington University Hospital. The cause is under investigation.|$|R

40|$|Nowadays {{structured}} overlay {{networks are}} used in controlled environments like company wide area networks. Even though these structured overlay networks are usually closed, {{there is still the}} risk that one or more nodes get compromised by attackers. When these networks provide business critical services, serious harm can be done by a compromised node. Because these networks are company controlled, properties like available bandwidth and latency times are much better known than in a general wide area network like the Internet. This knowledge can be used to create a system where malicious nodes in the network can be detected and located in {{a relatively short period of}} time and with little overhead. This thesis describes the design and implementation of the Sphinx protocol that provides this functionality. We show that it is possible to detect and locate malicious nodes in a distributed hash table in a short period of time, with little overhead, and with high sensitivity. We are able to detect and locate the nodes that cause latency deviations, dropping of messages, <b>mis-routing</b> of messages, and changing of the message payload. ivPreface This document describes my MSc project on detecting and locating malicious nodes in corporate distributed hash tables. This research was started at the CUR-RENT Lab of the University of California Santa Barbara under the supervision of Ben Y. Zhao, and completed at the Parallel and Distributed Systems Group of Delft University of Technology under the supervision of Dick Epema. First of all, I would like to thank my supervisors Ben Zhao and Dick Epema fo...|$|E
40|$|Error {{resilience}} is {{an important}} issue when coded video data is transmitted over wired and wireless networks. Errors can be introduced by network congestion, <b>mis-routing</b> and channel noise. These transmission errors can result in bit errors being introduced into the transmitted data or packets of data being completely lost. Consequently, the quality of the decoded video is degraded significantly. This thesis describes new techniques for minimising this degradation. To verify video error resilience tools, it is first necessary to consider the methods used to carry out experimental measurements. For most audio-visual services, streams of both audio and video data need to be simultaneously transmitted on a single channel. The inclusion of the impact of multiplexing schemes, such as MPEG 2 Systems, in error resilience studies is also an important consideration. It is shown that error resilience measurements including the effect of the Systems Layer differ significantly from those based only on the Video Layer. Two major issues of error resilience are investigated within this thesis. They are resynchronisation after error detection and error concealment. Results for resynchronisation using small slices, adaptive slice sizes and macroblock resynchronisation schemes are provided. These measurements show that the macroblock resynchronisation scheme achieves the best performance although it is not included in MPEG 2 standard. The performance of the adaptive slice size scheme, however, {{is similar to that of}} the macroblock resynchronisation scheme. This approach is compatible with the MPEG 2 standard. The most important contribution of this thesis is a new concealment technique, namely, Decoder Motion Vector Estimation (DMVE). The decoded video quality can be improved significantly with this technique. Basically, this technique utilises the temporal redundancy between the current and the previous frames, and the correlation between lost macroblocks and their surrounding pixels. Therefore, motion estimation can be applied again to search in the previous picture for a match to those lost macroblocks. The process is similar to that the encoder performs, but it is in the decoder. The integration of techniques such as DMVE with small slices, or adaptive slice sizes or macroblock resynchronisation is also evaluated. This provides an overview of the performance produced by individual techniques compared to the combined techniques. Results show that high performance can be achieved by integrating DMVE with an effective resynchronisation scheme, even at a high cell loss rates. The results of this thesis demonstrate clearly that the MPEG 2 standard is capable of providing a high level of error resilience, even in the presence of high loss. The key to this performance is appropriate tuning of encoders and effective concealment in decoders...|$|E
40|$|Correct {{targeting}} of newly synthesized proteins to appropriate domains {{of the cell}} membrane is crucial to cellular architecture, polarity and function, making it no surprise that many proteins of the secretory machinery are conserved throughout evolution. This work presents a functional characterisation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell polarity protein and tumour suppressor homologue, Sro 7 p. This protein, and its paralogue Sro 77 p, belong to the Lgl-family of WD- 40 repeat proteins that are conserved from yeast to human. Deletion of Lgl genes produces different phenotypes that all seem to share the common denominator of defective {{targeting of}} critical cell surface proteins. Yeast cells lacking SRO 7 become sensitive to NaCl and we here show that this defect is due to mis-targeting of the sodium transporter Ena 1 p. In sro 7 mutants Ena 1 p becomes routed to the vacuole for degradation via the multi-vesicular body (MVB) pathway, instead of being properly expressed at the cell surface. Isolation and analysis of post-Golgi secretory vesicles showed a defective sorting of Ena 1 p into these vesicles from sro 7 mutants, implying mis-sorting in late Golgi or early endosomes. The diversion of Ena 1 p into the MVB pathway further required ubiquitylation by the ubiquitin ligase Rsp 5 p. Isolation of suppressors of the sro 7 salt sensitivity identified two genes of unknown function, RSN 1 encoding a trans-membrane protein, and ART 5 (RSN 2), encoding an arrestin-like protein. Deletion of either gene in sro 7 mutants re-establishes salt tolerance and retargets Ena 1 p to the cell surface. Previous proteomic {{studies have shown that}} Art 5 p interacts with Rsp 5 p and we showed that deletion of ART 5 in sro 7 mutants inhibits ubiquitylation of Ena 1 p. Our data are consistent with Art 5 p being a selective adaptor protein that helps Rsp 5 p recruiting Ena 1 p for ubiquitylation. To identify further candidate proteins for mis-sorting in salt stressed sro 7 mutants we performed the first proteomic analysis of purified yeast post-Golgi vesicles (PGVs), using quantitative proteomics techniques. By this analysis we could identify 107 genuine vesicle residents in control yeast cells, including a number of cargo proteins not previously identified in PGVs. Vesicles derived from sro 7 mutants contained essentially the same list of proteins but were depleted of a subset of proteins, thus being candidates for <b>mis-routing.</b> The present study finally analysed possible Lgl conservation in plants by characterising two Arabidopsis thaliana Lgl homologues. Sequence based modelling showed that both proteins can fold into the twin β-propellers shown by the published Sro 7 p crystal structure. However, only one of the proteins, AtLGL 1, could partially substitute for the yeast Sro 7 / 77 proteins. The other, AtLGL 2 showed structural similarities with tomosyn that is known to regulate vesicle fusion in mammals. Homozygous T-DNA insertion mutants in A. thaliana exhibited defects in lateral root formation, a phenotype associated with changed cell- and tissue polarity...|$|E
50|$|In 2007 Garet & Jan Hil {{founded the}} National Kidney Registry (NKR) after their {{daughter}} (age 10) lost her kidney function {{and needed a}} transplant. Both parents were incompatible and could not donate to their daughter, who later, after an extensive donor search, received a living donor kidney from her compatible cousin. Mr. Hil was the first non-physician to start/lead a KPD program and the first KPD leader to donate one of his kidneys, starting a chain that facilitated 8 transplants. In 2008 the National Kidney Registry completed its first KPD transplants and implemented the next major innovation, the shipment of kidneys on commercial airlines. This breakthrough in logistics further expanded KPD. The first living donor kidney that was shipped on a commercial airline went from New York to Los Angeles and started NKR's second chain which facilitated eight transplants utilizing several bridge donors. Initially NKR provided donors with the option of traveling to the matched recipient's hospital or donating locally and having their kidney shipped. Recipients could also choose if they would accept a shipped kidney or require the donor to travel to their center to donate. Over a two-year period, these preferences shifted until nearly all recipients would accept shipped kidneys with very few donors willing to travel. By 2010 the option to have a donor travel was phased out and all kidneys {{that needed to be}} moved between centers were shipped. After several near misses and with the UNOS reporting that 1% - 2% of deceased donor kidney lost or <b>mis-routed,</b> the NKR developed the first GPS tracking systems for human organs to monitor the location of all NKR kidney shipments. The utilization of GPS tracking devices is now mandatory for all NKR shipped kidneys.|$|R
