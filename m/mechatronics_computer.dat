The book  includes topics such as surgery robotics, assist devices, rehabilitation technology, surgical instrumentation and Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) as examples for medical robotics. Autonomous cleaning, tending, logistics, surveying and rescue robots, and elderly and healthcare robots are typical examples of topics from service robotics. This is the Proceedings of the Third International Workshop on Medical and Service Robots, held in Lausanne, Switzerland in 2014. It presents an overview of current research directions and fields of interest. It {{is divided into three}} sections, namely 1) assistive and rehabilitation devices; 2) surgical robotics; and 3) educational and service robotics. Most contributions are strongly anchored on collaborations between technical and medical actors, engineers, surgeons and clinicians.

40|$|Industrial {{technology}} trends {{point to}} the saturation of the classical markets (like automotive and consumer electronics), followed by a huge development in areas like sensor technology, <b>mechatronics,</b> <b>computers,</b> human‐machine interfaces, high‐level programming, etc. This configures an opportunity to develop robotics and automation solutions adapted to small and medium enterprises (SME) : less expensive, safer, easier to install and program, more flexible and agile, capable of interfacing with consumer market electronic and computer products. The focus on SMEs is strategic both because technology manufacturers need to find new markets, and SMEs have a considerable weight in terms of GDP and employment. Stronger SMEs means a stronger economy. Programming an industrial robot by the typical teaching method is a tedious and time‐ consuming task that requires a considerable technical expertise. In opposition to the highly intelligent robots described in science fiction, current industrial robots are “non‐intelligent” machines that work in a controlled and well known environment. Generally, robots are designed, equipped and programmed to perform specific tasks, and thus, an unskilled worker {{will not be able}} to re‐program the robot to perform a different task...|$|R

40|$|The Self Distributing Virtual Machine (SDVM) is a {{middleware}} {{concept to}} form a parallel computing machine consisting of a any set of processing units, such as functional units in a processor or FPGA, processing units in a multiprocessor chip, or computers in a computer cluster. Its structure and functionality is biologically inspired aiming towards forming a combined workforce of independent units (”sites”), each acting on {{the same set of}} simple rules. The SDVM supports growing and shrinking the cluster at runtime as well as heterogeneous clusters. It uses the work-stealing principle to dynamically distribute the workload among all sites. The SDVM’s energy management targets the health of all sites by adjusting their power states according to workload and temperature. Dynamic reassignment of the current workload facilitates a new energy policy which focuses on increasing the reliability of each site. This paper presents the structure and the functionality of the SDVM. 1 st IFIP International Conference on Biologically Inspired Cooperative Computing - <b>Mechatronics</b> and <b>Computer</b> Cluster...|$|R
40|$|Deakin University in Australia {{is one of}} {{the leading}} {{providers}} of distance education in the South Pacific region. The School of Engineering offers four-year professional engineering-degree programs and three-year technologist programs. The over 600 total students studying engineering at Deakin fall into four categories: • 18 - 19 year-old students fresh from high school, who largely study on-campus, • older students in the technical workforce, seeking a university degree to upgrade their qualifications, • industry-based students studying in university-industry partnership programs, • overseas students studying either on-campus, or off-campus through education partners in Malaysia and Singapore. Geographically these students form a very wide student base. The study programs are designed to produce multi-skilled, broadly focused engineers and technologists with multi-disciplinary technical competence, and the ability to take a systems approach to design and operational performance. A team of around 25 academic staff deliver courses in seven different majors in the general fields of manufacturing, environmental engineering, <b>mechatronics,</b> and <b>computer</b> systems. We discuss here the history of the School, its teaching philosophy, and its unique methods in delivering engineering education to a widely scattered student body. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Self-optimizing {{mechatronic}} systems react autonomously and flexibly {{to changing}} conditions. They {{are capable of}} learning and optimize their behavior throughout their life cycle. The paradigm of self-optimization is originally inspired by the behavior of biological systems. The key to the successful development of self-optimizing systems is a conceptual design process that precisely describes the desired system behavior. In the area of mechanical engineering, active principles based on physical effects such as friction or lever are widely used to concretize the construction structure and the behavior. The same approach {{can be found in}} the domain of software-engineering with software patterns such as the broker-pattern or the strategy pattern. However there is no appropriate design schema for the development of intelligent mechatronic systems covering the needs to fulfill the paradigm of self-optimization. This article proposes such a schema called Active Patterns for Self-Optimization. It is shown how a catalogue of active patterns can be derived from a set of four basic active patterns. This design approach is validated for a networked mechatronic system in a multiagent setting where the behavior is implemented according to a biologically inspired technique – the neuro-fuzzy learning method. 1 st IFIP International Conference on Biologically Inspired Cooperative Computing - <b>Mechatronics</b> and <b>Computer</b> Cluster...|$|R
40|$|Development of {{humanoid}} {{and dance}} robots has improved greatly due to rapid advancement of electronics, <b>computer,</b> <b>mechatronics</b> and control technologies. While humanoid robots such as Honda ASIMO, Fujita HOAP- 3 and Sony QRIO have dazed {{the public with}} their amazing capabilities, such robots are in very limited supply and they are also extremely expensive. On the other hand, the low cost toy robot, WowWee's Robosapien (RS), has become very popular. It has also expanded its functionalities in later models since its line of products were first launched in 2004. The {{most important aspect of}} such robot is its cost is {{only a fraction of the}} highly sophisticated robots. This study investigates the feasibility of using low cost robots such as RS for the purposes of entertainment and teaching Thai dances.

40|$|Politeknik Caltex Riau (PCR) {{is one of}} {{the private}} {{educational}} institutions, where income from student tuition fees is the main income to run its operations. Therefore, it is very important for PCR to conduct an analysis of the cost per student per semester. It {{can be used as a}} basis for determining the fees to be paid by each student every semester and can maintain the competitiveness of each department with other private educational institutions. The aims of this study are to determine how much the unit cost per student and how much student from engineering and social department has to pay. PCR Cost analysis is performed by using the Time-Driven Activity Based Costing (TDABC) approach to allocate the cost from supporting departments to the main departments and then allocate costs to cost objects such as students. The results show that tuition fee per student of engineering departments is higher than the social department. There are five engineering departments: Electronics, <b>Computer,</b> <b>Mechatronics,</b> Telecommunications and Information Systems where the student tuition fee is smaller than the unit cost given. Thus, in order to cover the unit cost and maintain the quality and competitiveness, PCR should recalculated the unit cost per student to set reasonable tuition fee...|$|R
