2500|$|When rnbsp&≫nbsp&1 the {{amplitude}} of the vibration is actually {{less than the}} static deflection [...] In this region the force generated by the mass (Fnbsp&=nbsp&ma) is dominating because the acceleration seen by the mass increases with the frequency. Since the deflection seen in the spring, X, is reduced in this region, the force transmitted by the spring (Fnbsp&=nbsp&kx) to the base is reduced. Therefore, the massndash&springndash&damper system is isolating the harmonic force from the <b>mounting</b> <b>base</b> – referred to as vibration isolation. Interestingly, more damping actually reduces the effects of vibration isolation when rnbsp&≫nbsp&1 because the damping force (Fnbsp&=nbsp&cv) is also transmitted to the base.|$|E

50|$|In common usage, {{the name}} Letraset {{originally}} referred to sheets of transfer lettering which was originally manufactured as a wet process in 1959, with each character selected and {{cut from a}} sheet, placed face-down on a small silk screen frame and wetted with a paint brush to soften and release the gum arabic adhesive which held it.

50|$|Beryllium oxide {{is used in}} many {{high-performance}} semiconductor {{parts for}} applications such as radio equipment because it has good thermal conductivity while also being a good electrical insulator.

Some power semiconductor devices have used beryllium oxide ceramic between the silicon chip and the metal <b>mounting</b> <b>base</b> of the package to achieve a lower value of thermal resistance than a similar construction of aluminium oxide. It is also used as a structural ceramic for high-performance microwave devices, vacuum tubes, magnetrons, and gas lasers. BeO has been proposed as a moderator for naval marine high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (MGCR).|$|E
50|$|In use, the B-type {{telephone}} base proved unstable during dialing, and {{was replaced}} with the D-type handset mounting in 1930. A wider, oval base improved its stability. While the D1 <b>mounting</b> <b>base</b> was initially deployed electrically identical to the prior models, advances in the anti-sidetone audio circuitry soon reached production quality, so that D1 sets are most commonly identified as the 202-type telephone. The assembly codes 102 and 202 referred whence to the electrical capabilities of the sets, the 102 having no sidetone reduction, and the 202 containing the anti-sidetone improvements. Thus, {{some of the early}} oval D mounts, would still be designated as model 102 if they did not yet have the anti-sidetone circuitry.|$|E

The mount comprises a flat plate riveted to the left wall of the receiver housing and a support bracket fixed to the <b>mounting</b> <b>base</b> with screws. To shield the light-sensitive photo detector plate of the night vision sight, the weapon uses a slotted flash suppressor, which replaces the standard recoil compensator. The AKML can also be deployed in the prone position with a detachable barrel-mounted bipod that helps stabilize the weapon and reduces operator fatigue during prolonged periods of observation. The bipod is supplied as an accessory and is carried in a holster attached to the duty belt.|$|E

50|$|In 1926, Western Electric {{issued the}} first Bell System {{telephone}} with a handset containing both the {{transmitter and receiver}} in the same unit. Previous telephones had been of the candlestick type which featured a stationary transmitter in the desktop set or the wall mount, and a hand-held receiver {{to be placed on}} the user's ear. This desktop unit was initially constructed by shortening the candlestick neck to about an inch in length and placing a handset cradle on the top. This was the A1 mount, which was replaced within 2 years by the B1 mounting set, which featured an integrated design in streamlined shape. It still had the same circular footprint of the candlestick, which proved too unstable when dialing numbers, and was henceforth replaced with a wider design using an oval footprint, the D1 <b>mounting</b> <b>base</b> in 1930.|$|E
50|$|This entire {{sight head}} {{mechanism}} was {{mounted on the}} same base as the Mk. XIV, which carried a standardized mounting system that clamped onto two vertical metal rods {{on the left side}} of the sight. This system was originally designed for the Course Setting Bomb Sight, and reused for the Mk. XIV, and now the Mk. III. The <b>mounting</b> <b>base</b> also retained the system for turning the entire sighting head to the left or right, which the bomb aimer used to keep the vertical line centered on the target and to call any required corrections to the pilot if he noticed any sideways drift. Unlike the Mk. XIV, this motion was unpowered. Although the computor was much smaller than the Mk. XIV's, it too could clamp into the same fittings in the aircraft. This allowed a Mk. III and Mk. XIV to be easily swapped in the field.|$|E
50|$|Concurrently to the {{mechanical}} advances, the electronic makeup of Western Electric telephones saw advances in sidetone reduction. Sidetone is an electronic feedback phenomenon {{by which the}} users of the telephone would hear their own voice very loudly in the receiver. This caused most users to lower their voice volume to unacceptable levels. The first production volumes of both the B1 and D1 mounts contained only the older electronics, without sidetone suppression. Such telephone models where designated with the assembly code 102 (Model 102 telephone), while later models starting in 1930, containing anti-sidetone circuitry, were the Model 202 telephone set. These early desktop telephones {{did not have any}} electronics within the <b>mounting</b> <b>base</b> itself, but instead relied on an external subscriber set (subset) containing the ringer with gongs, and the electronics (induction coils, capacitors) to interface with the telephone network. These subscriber sets were typically mounted on a wall near the operating location for the phone.|$|E

40|$|In chronic {{recording}} experiments, self-curing dental acrylic resins {{have been}} used as a <b>mounting</b> <b>base</b> of electrodes or microdialysis-probes. Since these acrylics do not bond to the bone, screws {{have been used}} as anchors.

In this report, we propose a new application of light-curing dental resins for <b>mounting</b> <b>base</b> of electrodes or microdialysis probes in chronic experiments. This material allows direct bonding to the cranium. Therefore, anchor screws are not required and surgical field can be reduced considerably. Past experiences show that the bonding effect maintains more than 2 months. Conventional resin's window of time when the materials are pliable and workable is a few minutes. However, the window of working time for these dental adhesives is significantly wider and adjustable...|$|E
