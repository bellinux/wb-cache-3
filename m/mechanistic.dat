5|$|Despite the <b>mechanistic</b> {{possibility}} for catalysis, multiple equivalents of the promoter are often required {{in order to}} effect the reaction. This limits the atom economy of the reaction.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, the German {{paleontologist}} Otto Schindewolf {{argued that}} variation tends {{to move in}} a predetermined direction. He believed this was purely <b>mechanistic,</b> denying any kind of vitalism, but that evolution occurs due to a periodic cycle of evolutionary processes dictated by factors internal to the organism.|$|E
5|$|A study – {{conducted}} by He et al. – used a <b>mechanistic</b> modelling approach {{to study the}} three waves of the 1918 influenza pandemic. They tried to study the factors that underlie variability in temporal patterns, and the patterns of mortality and morbidity. Their analysis suggests that temporal variations in transmission rate provide the best explanation and the variation in transmission required to generate these three waves is within biologically plausible values.|$|E
5|$|As {{originally}} described, the Nazarov cyclization {{involves the}} activation of a divinyl ketone using a stoichiometric Lewis acid or protic acid promoter. The key {{step of the}} reaction mechanism involves a cationic 4π-electrocyclic ring closure which forms the cyclopentenone product (See Mechanism below). As the reaction has been developed, variants involving substrates other than divinyl ketones and promoters other than Lewis acids have been subsumed under the name Nazarov cyclization provided that they follow a similar <b>mechanistic</b> pathway.|$|E
5|$|The same triad {{geometries}} been converged upon by serine proteases {{such as the}} chymotrypsin and subtilisin superfamilies. Similar convergent {{evolution has}} occurred with cysteine proteases such as viral C3 protease and papain superfamilies. These triads have converged to almost the same arrangement due to the <b>mechanistic</b> similarities in cysteine and serine proteolysis mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|This {{chelation}} is {{in contrast}} to the mechanism for formation of the over-addition product wherein collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate allows a second addition. The <b>mechanistic</b> conjecture on the part of Weinreb was immediately accepted by the academic community, {{but it was not until}} 2006 that it was confirmed by spectroscopic and kinetic analyses.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle's pupil and {{successor}} at the Lyceum, Theophrastus, {{wrote the}} History of Plants, the first classical book of botany. It has an Aristotelian structure, {{but rather than}} focus on formal causes, as Aristotle did, Theophrastus suggested a <b>mechanistic</b> scheme, comparing natural and artificial processes. Where Aristotle expanded on grand theories, Theophrastus was quietly empirical. Where Aristotle insisted that species have a fixed place on the scala naturae, Theophrastus suggests that one kind of plant can transform into another, as when a field sown to wheat turns to the weed darnel.|$|E
5|$|Polyketides are {{synthesized}} by polymerization of acetyl and propionyl subunits by classic enzymes {{as well as}} iterative and multimodular {{enzymes that}} share <b>mechanistic</b> features with the fatty acid synthases. They comprise {{a large number of}} secondary metabolites and natural products from animal, plant, bacterial, fungal and marine sources, and have great structural diversity. Many polyketides are cyclic molecules whose backbones are often further modified by glycosylation, methylation, hydroxylation, oxidation, or other processes. Many commonly used anti-microbial, anti-parasitic, and anti-cancer agents are polyketides or polyketide derivatives, such as erythromycins, tetracyclines, avermectins, and antitumor epothilones.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{diffusion}} may {{be studied}} {{by a variety}} of techniques, including both direct and indirect observations. Two experimental techniques that have proved very useful in this area of study are field ion microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy. By visualizing the displacement of atoms or clusters over time, it is possible to extract useful information regarding {{the manner in which the}} relevant species diffuse-both <b>mechanistic</b> and rate-related information. In order to study surface diffusion on the atomistic scale it is unfortunately necessary to perform studies on rigorously clean surfaces and in ultra high vacuum (UHV) conditions or in the presence of small amounts of inert gas, as is the case when using He or Ne as imaging gas in field-ion microscopy experiments.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequently}} used argument in favour of dualism appeals to the common-sense intuition that conscious experience is distinct from inanimate matter. If asked what the mind is, the average person would usually respond by identifying it with their self, their personality, their soul, or some other such entity. They would almost certainly deny that the mind simply is the brain, or vice versa, finding {{the idea that there}} is just one ontological entity at play to be too <b>mechanistic,</b> or simply unintelligible. Many modern philosophers of mind think that these intuitions are misleading and that we should use our critical faculties, along with empirical evidence from the sciences, to examine these assumptions to determine whether there is any real basis to them.|$|E
5|$|Ecological {{studies are}} {{necessarily}} holistic {{as opposed to}} reductionistic. Holism has three scientific meanings or uses that identify with ecology: 1) the <b>mechanistic</b> complexity of ecosystems, 2) the practical description of patterns in quantitative reductionist terms where correlations may be identified but nothing is understood about the causal relations {{without reference to the}} whole system, which leads to 3) a metaphysical hierarchy whereby the causal relations of larger systems are understood without reference to the smaller parts. Scientific holism differs from mysticism that has appropriated the same term. An example of metaphysical holism is identified in the trend of increased exterior thickness in shells of different species. The reason for a thickness increase can be understood through reference to principles of natural selection via predation without need to reference or understand the biomolecular properties of the exterior shells.|$|E
5|$|Purified MAM from {{subcellular}} fractionation {{has been}} shown to be enriched in enzymes involved in phospholipid exchange, in addition to channels associated with Ca2+ signaling. These hints of a prominent role for the MAM in the regulation of cellular lipid stores and signal transduction have been borne out, with significant implications for mitochondrial-associated cellular phenomena, as discussed below. Not only has the MAM provided insight into the <b>mechanistic</b> basis underlying such physiological processes as intrinsic apoptosis and the propagation of calcium signaling, but it also favors a more refined view of the mitochondria. Though often seen as static, isolated 'powerhouses' hijacked for cellular metabolism through an ancient endosymbiotic event, the evolution of the MAM underscores the extent to which mitochondria have been integrated into overall cellular physiology, with intimate physical and functional coupling to the endomembrane system.|$|E
5|$|TCDD was {{classified}} in 1997 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a carcinogen for humans (group 1). In the occupational cohort studies {{available for the}} classification, the risk, even at very high exposures, was weak and borderline detectable. Therefore, human data were not deemed sufficient, and the classification was, in essence, based on animal experiments and <b>mechanistic</b> considerations. This has been criticized as a deviation from IARC classification rules. It is much debated whether TCDD is carcinogenic only at high doses which also cause toxic damage of tissues. Moreover, a recent review concludes that, after 1997, further studies do not support an association between TCDD exposure and cancer risk. New studies include the update of Vietnam veteran studies from Ranch Hand operation, which concluded that after 30 years the results do not provide evidence of disease.|$|E
25|$|Mecca Chiesa {{notes that}} the {{probabilistic}} or selectionistic determinism of B.F. Skinner comprised a wholly separate conception of determinism that was not <b>mechanistic</b> at all. <b>Mechanistic</b> determinism assumes that every event has an unbroken chain of prior occurrences, but a selectionistic or probabilistic model does not.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{attempting}} to understand relative species abundance patterns usually approach {{them in a}} descriptive or <b>mechanistic</b> way. Using a descriptive approach biologists attempt to fit a mathematical model to real data sets and infer the underlying biological principles at work from the model parameters. By contrast, <b>mechanistic</b> approaches create a mathematical model based on biological principles and then test how well these models fit real data sets.|$|E
25|$|The <b>mechanistic</b> materialism that {{originated}} in ancient Greece was revived and revised by the French philosopher René Descartes, who held that {{animals and humans}} were assemblages of parts that together functioned as a machine. In the 19th century, the advances in cell theory in biological science encouraged this view. The evolutionary theory of Charles Darwin (1859) is a <b>mechanistic</b> explanation for {{the origin of species}} by means of natural selection.|$|E

25|$|Most {{sources say}} that Democritus {{followed}} {{in the tradition of}} Leucippus and that they carried on the scientific rationalist philosophy associated with Miletus. Both were thoroughly materialist, believing everything {{to be the result of}} natural laws. Unlike Aristotle or Plato, the atomists attempted to explain the world without reasoning as to purpose, prime mover, or final cause. For the atomists questions of physics should be answered with a <b>mechanistic</b> explanation ("What earlier circumstances caused this event?"), while their opponents search for explanations which, in addition to the material and <b>mechanistic,</b> also included the formal and teleological ("What purpose did this event serve?").|$|E
25|$|If {{matter and}} energy are seen as {{necessary}} to explain the physical world, but incapable of explaining mind, dualism results. Emergence, holism, and process philosophy seek to ameliorate the perceived shortcomings of traditional (especially <b>mechanistic)</b> materialism without abandoning materialism entirely.|$|E
25|$|The <b>mechanistic</b> {{details of}} the Samsara {{doctrine}} vary within the Buddhist traditions. Theravada Buddhists assert that rebirth is immediate while the Tibetan schools hold {{to the notion of}} a bardo (intermediate state) that can last up to forty-nine days before the being is reborn.|$|E
25|$|Scope: While new {{reactions}} {{are constantly being}} discovered, most reactions have extremely narrow substrate scope {{and the reason for}} such narrow scope is often not understood. In the field of palladium catalysis, after the foundations of <b>mechanistic</b> understanding were established, the scope of reactions saw rapid growth. Knowing the factors that affected each step of catalysis allowed for the chemists to envision and pursue new reactions of high synthetic utility, such as C-H bond activation reactions. In the field hydrogen bond catalysis, chemists have not yet reached a stage where new types of reactivity can be easily and systematically targeted. At this point, reaction discovery is useful, but more detailed <b>mechanistic</b> study is required to realize the full potential of hydrogen bond catalysis.|$|E
25|$|Buddhist traditions also vary {{in their}} <b>mechanistic</b> details on rebirth. Theravada Buddhists assert that rebirth is {{immediate}} while the Tibetan schools hold {{to the notion of}} a bardo (intermediate state) that can last up to 49 days. The bardo rebirth concept of Tibetan Buddhism, along with yidam, developed independently in Tibet without Indian influence, and involves 42 peaceful deities, and 58 wrathful deities. These ideas led to <b>mechanistic</b> maps on karma and what form of rebirth one takes after death, discussed in texts such as The Tibetan Book of the Dead. The major Buddhist traditions accept that the reincarnation of a being depends on the past karma and merit (demerit) accumulated, and that there are six realms of existence in which the rebirth may occur after each death.|$|E
25|$|Cln3 regulates Start, {{the point}} at which budding yeast commit to the G1/S {{transition}} and thus a round of mitotic division. It was first identified as a gene controlling this process in the 1980s; research {{over the past few decades}} has provided a <b>mechanistic</b> understanding of its function.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory was}} {{developed}} by John Turner and colleagues, and along with social identity theory it is a constituent {{part of the social}} identity approach. It was in part developed to address questions that arose in response to social identity theory about the <b>mechanistic</b> underpinnings of social identification.|$|E
25|$|As {{discussed}} {{in more detail}} below, phylogenetic methods range from simple methods merely identifying discordance between gene and species trees to <b>mechanistic</b> models inferring probable sequences of HGT events. An intermediate strategy entails deconstructing the gene tree into smaller parts until each matches the species tree (genome spectral approaches).|$|E
25|$|Later in {{the same}} year Albert Einstein {{published}} what is now called special relativity, by deriving the Lorentz transformation under the assumptions of the principle of relativity and the constancy of the speed of light in any inertial reference frame, and by abandoning the <b>mechanistic</b> aether as unnecessary.|$|E
25|$|The Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity and Biogeography (UNTB) is {{a special}} form of <b>mechanistic</b> model that takes an entirely {{different}} approach to community composition than the niche apportionment models. Instead of species populations reaching equilibrium within a community, the UNTB model is dynamic, allowing for continuing changes in relative species abundances through drift.|$|E
25|$|Chromium can oxidize allylic {{alcohols}} to alpha-beta unsaturated ketones on {{the opposite}} side of the unsaturated bond from the alcohol. This is via a concerted hetero-Claisen reaction, although there are <b>mechanistic</b> differences since the chromium atom has access to d- shell orbitals which allow the reaction under a less constrained set of geometries.|$|E
25|$|His <b>mechanistic</b> {{approach}} {{was extended to}} the issue of animal consciousness. Mind, for Descartes, was a thing apart from the physical universe, a separate substance, linking human beings to the mind of God. The nonhuman, on the other hand, were for Descartes nothing but complex automata, with no souls, minds, or reason.|$|E
