40|$|Economic {{modeling}} {{of the business}} cases for FTTH has revealed that it is most cost ef-fective to concentrate initial deployments in densely populated areas. That fact, coupled {{with the realization that}} in such dense ar-eas the majority of subscribers live in mul-tiple dwelling units (MDUs), is driving a strong need for FTTH systems optimized for MDU installations. The shared experiences of many leading service providers around the world indi-cate that there are several common goals that must be attained to optimize FTTH deployments to MDUs: reduce up-front in-stallation costs; increase the speed of making a subscriber connection; reduce lifetime op-erating costs; and maximize the reach, split ratio, and subscriber penetration of the network. To achieve the first two goals, operators need hardware that increases the speed and ease of inside wiring installation and reduces labor and material costs as well as the number of loss-related rework events during cable instal-lation. In short, the FTTH industry needs op-tical cables that can be installed and handled in the same robust manner as copper cables. However, as shown in Fig. 1, optical ca-bles treated in this manner can be subjected to tight bends, compression points in con-gested ducts, and stapling. Corning and Ve-rizon have investigated the impact of such installation and handling practices and have determined that the optical fiber can see bends down to 5 mm in radius. 1 As dis-cussed elsewhere 1, fiber <b>macrobend</b> <b>loss</b> of less than 0. 1 dB/ turn at 5 mm is required to keep the inside wir-ing total loss at maximum a few tenths of a deci-bel. Traditional standard sing-lemode fibers subjected to one full (360 °) turn at a 5 -mm bend radius would ex-hibit a loss in ex-cess of 10 dB (see table).

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a pose-sensing system for soft robot arms integrating {{a set of}} macrobend stretch sensors. The macrobend sensory design in this study consists of optical fibres {{and is based on}} the notion that bending an optical fibre modulates the intensity of the light transmitted through the fibre. This sensing method is capable of measuring bending, elongation and compression in soft continuum robots and is also applicable to wearable sensing technologies, e. g. pose sensing in the wrist joint of a human hand. In our arrangement, applied to a cylindrical soft robot arm, the optical fibres for macrobend sensing originate from the base, extend to the tip of the arm, and then loop back to the base. The connectors that link the fibres to the necessary opto-electronics are all placed {{at the base of the}} arm, resulting in a simplified overall design. The ability of this custom macrobend stretch sensor to flexibly adapt its configuration allows preserving the inherent softness and compliance of the robot which it is installed on. The macrobend sensing system is immune to electrical noise and magnetic fields, is safe (because no electricity is needed at the sensing site), and is suitable for modular implementation in multi-link soft continuum robotic arms. The measurable light outputs of the proposed stretch sensor vary due to bend-induced light attenuation (<b>macrobend</b> <b>loss),</b> which is a function of the fibre bend radius as well as the number of repeated turns. The experimental study conducted as part of this research revealed that the chosen bend radius has a far greater impact on the measured light intensity values than the number of turns (if greater than five). Taking into account that the bend radius is the only significantly influencing design parameter, the macrobend stretch sensors were developed to create a practical solution to the pose sensing in soft continuum robot arms. Henceforward, the proposed sensing design was benchmarked against an electromagnetic tracking system (NDI Aurora) for validation...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} of <b>macrobend</b> <b>losses</b> in Single Mode Fibre (SMF) and Multimode Fibre (MMF) is presented. The increased demand on information has seen optical fibres slowly replacing {{the use of}} copper coaxial cables for signal transmission, and this, {{largely due to the}} high bandwidth and speed of transmission, large carrying capacity and security offered by optical fibres. Signal attenuation however remains a limitation to efficient and quality signal transmission and macrobending is one of the loss mechanisms that contributes to this signal attenuation. Appreciating the responses of the different optic fibres in use to macrobending is therefore instrumental in ensuring macrobending contribution to overall attenuation in optic fibres is minimum at all times. In this study the <b>macrobend</b> <b>losses</b> trends with bending diameter were investigated for the SMF and MMF in similar experimental setups. To do this improvisions were done for a light source using 555 timer astable multivibrator powering a green LED, a light detector using an LDR in a Wheatstone bridge circuit and optic fibres off-cuts. Optic power was measured at the input and output points of the optic fibres using the light detector in bend and straight conditions for determination of signal attenuation in each case. The experimental measurement results show that <b>macrobending</b> <b>losses</b> are more pronounced in a SMF than in a MMF. Characteristic values for <b>macrobending</b> <b>loss</b> are 1268 dB/km for SMF compared to 1155 dB/km for MMF for bending diameter value 4. 19 cm. In the SMF <b>macrobending</b> <b>loss</b> trend showed an exponential variation which agrees with work by previous authors. The contribution of <b>macrobending</b> <b>loss</b> in multimode fibre attenuation was however minimal and therefore difficult to quantify. Results also showed that MMF have a higher overall signal attenuation than SMF which justifies the use of SMF in long distance signal transmission. Research findings confirm the significant contribution of macrobending to optic fibre signal attenuation hence the need for careful iv consideration in installations for optimal operation of optic fibres. This would mean the choice of optic fibre in any particular instance should consider the high attenuation in MMF not neglecting the insignificant macrobending contribution of MMF to attenuation at any preferred wavelength in order to obtain required transmission characteristics.,University of Zimbabwe,DAAD and the Research Council of Zimbabw...|$|R

The interface is used in neuroimaging experiments, allowing for the first time, the acquisition of cello performance gestures captured inside the MRI scanner. Left-hand fingering and right-hand bowing gestures were captured with optical sensors embedded in the fingerboard, bridge, and bow. Finger-string interaction was sensed through diffuse reflection using plastic optical fibres potted in a 3 D-printed fingerboard. Acoustic string vibration was sensed through the transmissive amplitude modulation of an emitting-receiving fibre pair mounted in a specially designed bridge.

40|$|The Fiber Optic Respiratory Plethysmograph (FORP) is a {{non-invasive}} {{instrument for}} respiratory and heart monitoring in humans, {{based on the}} design of the Respiratory Inductive Plethysmograph (RIP.

40|$|The {{recently}} developed technique of fibre optic respiratory plethysmography (FORP) has been modified {{to monitor the}} rapid, small amplitude movements of the chest wall during high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV). The FORP sensor is an expandable belt encircling the chest, in which is housed a fibre optic loop that alters its radius of curvature {{as a function of}} chest perimeter. These curvature changes cause variations in <b>macrobending</b> <b>losses</b> of light transmitted through the fibre, which are proportional to the chest perimeter. Dynamic measurement of transmitted light intensity can hence be used to monitor chest wall motion (CWM). For application to HFOV, the design of the FORP belt was altered to increase sensitivity and the materials were chosen to maximise macrobending effects induced by the CWM. FORP was tested in four piglets ventilated with HFOV, both in the normal and surfactant-deficient lung. Measurement of CWM was possible over the full range of tidal volumes and ventilation frequencies used during HFOV. In all cases, the measured frequency of the CWM fell within 3 % of the applied ventilation frequency. In addition, the technique was sufficiently sensitive to detect changes in the amplitude of CWM in response to changes in applied tidal volume. It is anticipated that application of this new non-invasive measurement device will lead to an increased understanding of the dynamics of chest and abdominal wall motion during HFOV...|$|R
