Its mechanism of action appears related {{to the formation of}} DNA interstrand-cross-links (DNA-ISC) {{in a manner similar to}} that described for chloroethylnitrosoureas (Gibson et al., 1984 a, b).

40|$|The DNA repair enzyme, O 6 -alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase (ATase), {{is thought}} to be the {{principal}} mechanism controlling resistance to nitrosoureas and related alkylating agents. We compared the sensitivities of five human testis and five bladder tumour cell lines to two nitrosoureas (N-nitroso-N-methylurea (MNU) and <b>mitozolomide)</b> with cellular levels of ATase. Enzyme levels ranged from 3 to 206 fmol mg- 1 protein (0. 1 x 10 (4) to 5. 1 x 10 (4) molecules/cell) in the testis lines and from 11 to 603 fmol mg- 1 (0. 4 x 10 (4) to 9. 1 x 10 (4) molecules/cell) in the bladder lines. Based on IC 50 s in an MTT assay, the testis tumour cell lines were, on average, four times more sensitive to MNU and six times more sensitive to <b>mitozolomide</b> than the bladder cell lines. The cytotoxicities of MNU and <b>mitozolomide</b> were closely related (R = 0. 9). In the testis cell lines ATase activity (molecules/cell) was related to IC 50 s for <b>mitozolomide</b> (R = 0. 97) but not MNU (R = 0. 78). In the bladder cell lines and overall, ATase activity correlated with cellular sensitivity to neither agent. Relatively high levels of resistance occurred in cells expressing low levels of ATase, and amongst cell lines expressing high levels of ATase, large differences in IC 50 s were observed. These results support the suggestion that resistance to nitrosoureas can be mediated by mechanisms other than ATase and that at relatively high levels of expression, ATase does not confer resistance in proportion to its activity...|$|E

40|$|Covalent {{attachment}} of the anticancer drugs temozolomide (Temodal) and <b>mitozolomide</b> to triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) is {{a potential}} way of targeting these alkylating agents to specific gene sequences to maximise site-selectivity. In this work, polypyrimidine TFO conjugates of both drugs were synthesised and targeted to duplex DNA {{in an attempt to}} effect site-specific alkylation of guanine residues. Concurrently, in an attempt to enhance the triple helix stability of TFOs at neutral pH, the thermal stabilities of triplexes formed from TFOs containing isoguanine, 2 -O-benzyl- and 2 -O-allyl-adenine were evaluated. A novel cleavage and deprotection procedure was developed which allowed for the solid phase synthesis of the base-sensitive TFO-drug conjugates using a recently developed silyl-linked controlled pore glass (SLCPG) support. Covalent attachment of either temozolomide or <b>mitozolomide</b> at the 5 '-end of TFO conjugates caused no destabilisation of the triplexes studied. The synthesis of a phosphoramidite derivative of <b>mitozolomide</b> enabled direct incorporation of this reagent into a model sequence during DNA synthesis. After cleavage and deprotection of the TFO-drug conjugate, the 5 '-end <b>mitozolomide</b> residue was found to have decomposed presumably as a result of ring-opening of the tetrazinone ring. The base-sensitive antibacterial and antitumour agent, metronidazole, was also successfully incorporated at the 5 '-end of the oligonucleotide d(T 8) using conventional methods. Two C 2 -substituted derivatives of 2 '-deoxyadenosine containing 2 -O-benzyl and 2 -O-allyl groups were synthesised. Hydrogenolysis of the 2 -O-benzyl analogue provided a useful route, amenable to scale-up, for the synthesis of the rare nucleoside 2 '-deoxyisoguanosine (isoG). Both the 2 -O-allyl and 2 -O-benzyl derivatives were incorporated into TFO sequences using phosphoramidite methodology. Thermal melting experiments showed that the 2 -O-allyl and 2 -O-benzyl groups caused marked destabilisation of the triple helices studied, in contrast to hexose-DNA duplexes, where aralkyl substituents caused significant stabilisation of duplexes. TFOs containing isoG were synthesised by Pd(O) -catalysed deallylation of 2 - 0 -allyl adenine residues.

When administered as two separate injections over a 24 h period (acute administration) TNF produced a dose-related weight reduction that was accompanied by and directly proportional to a decrease in both food and water intake. When administered daily by i. v. injection over a 5 -day period (chronic administration) the major weight loss was found to occur during the first 24 h after injection and thereafter the weight of treated mice increased toward that of controls. Acute administration of TNF produced hypoglycaemia that was more severe than observed with either <b>mitozolomide</b> or in pair-fed controls, a reduction in the circulatory level of free fatty acids (FFA) and an increase in plasma triglycerides, while <b>mitozolomide</b> and pair-feeding had no effect on the level of blood glucose or plasma triglycerides.

In order to examine such interactions a three pronged approach involving molecular modelling, synthetic chemistry and biological analysis has been undertaken {{during the course of}} this project.. Molecular modelling studies have shown that for the 8 -carboxamido substituted imidazotetrazinones antitumour activity is dependent upon the. presence of a free NH group which can be involved in the formation of both intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds, and the presence of a non-bulky substituent with a small negative potential. volume. Modelling studies involving the docking of. <b>mitozolomide</b> into the major groove of DNA in the region of a triguanine sequence has shown that a number of hydrogen bonding interactions are feasible. A series of 8 -substituted carboxamide derivatives of <b>mitozolomide</b> have been synthesised via the 8 -acid chloride and 8 -carboxylic acid derivatives including a number of peptide analogues. The peptide derivatives were based upon the key structural features of the helix-turn-helix motif of DNA-binding proteins with a view to developing agents that are capable of binding to DNA with greater selectivity. An examination of the importance of intramolecular hydrogen bonding in influencing the antitumour activity:of :the imidazotetrazinones has led to the synthesis of the novel pyrimido[4 ', 5 ' : 4, 3]pyrazolo[5, 1 -d]- 1, 2, 3, 5 -tetrazine ring system. In general, in vitro cytotoxicity assays showed that the new derivatives were less active against the TLX 5 lymphoma cell line. than the parent compound <b>mitozolomide</b> despite an increased potential for hydrogen bonding interactions. Due to the high reactivity of the: tetrazinone ring system it is difficult to study the interactions between the imidazotetrazinones and DNA. Consequently a number of structural analogues that are stable under physiological conditions have been. prepared based upon the 1, 2, 3 triazin- 4 (3 H) -one ring system fused with both benzene and pyrazole rings. Although the 3 -methylbenzotriazinones failed to antagonise the cytotoxic activity of temozolomide encouraging results with a 3 -methylpyrazolotriazinone may suggest the existence of an imidazotetrazinone receptor site within DNA. The potential of guanine rich sequences to promote the alkylating selectivity of imidazotetrazinones by acting as a catalyst for ring cleavage and thereby generation of the alkylating agent was examined.

The effect of drug treatment on the incorporation of precursors into macromolecules, and their pool sizes, was examined. Temozolomide administration was found to alter de novo protein synthesis in both GM 892 A and Raji cells. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that temozolomide and CCRG 82019 block cells in late S/G 2 /M phase of the cell cycle, similar to that observed with <b>mitozolomide.</b> The extent of reaction of all three drugs with isolated macromolecules and cellular macromolecules was determined, and differences found, with cellular repair processes influencing the number of alkyl lesions remaining bound to macromolecules.

Variation of substituents at N 5 showed that their stability decreases with increasing steric bulk of the substituents. The decomposition of benzotetrazepinones generally gave N-phenyl-N,N$ sp prime$-dimethylureas, 1 -alkylbenzotriazoles and 2 -hydroxy-benzimidazoles. The synthesis of stable pyrido- 1, 2, 3, 5 -tetrazepinones is also described. The tetrazepinones were generally characterized by $ sp 1 $H and $ sp{ 13 }$C NMR, X-ray diffraction, mass spectroscopy and microanalysis. The existence of the triazene chain was usually confirmed by $ sp{ 15 }$N NMR spectroscopy after specific labelling of the central nitrogen (N 2). (DIAGRAM, TABLE OR GRAPHIC OMITTED [...] .

40|$|The {{targeting}} of mRNA with antisense oligonucleotides is increasingly employed to inhibit {{the expression of}} gene function, Since {{the level of the}} DNA repair protein O- 6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is decisive in protection of cells against damage produced by alkylating agents, including cytostatic drugs, the targeted inhibition of this repair activity might be of importance for therapeutic approaches, In order to investigate whether antisense targeted MGMT depletion is feasible to transiently modify the sensitivity of cells to anticancer drugs, we studied the expression of MGMT and cellular sensitivity upon inhibitor and antisense treatment using CHO transfectants expressing human MGMT. It was shown by polymerase chain reaction that antisense oligonucleotides specifically inhibited MGMT mRNA level, Nevertheless, MGMT protein was found not to be reduced significantly, as demonstrated by Western blotting, Correspondingly, no significant decrease in MGMT activity was observed, as measured 36 h after MGMT antisense oligonucleotide administration. Given together with the MGMT depleting agent O- 6 -methylguanine, reduction in MGMT protein as well as activity was found. MGMT antisense oligonucleotide enhanced the sensitivity of cells to the tumor therapeutic drug <b>mitozolomide,</b> as measured by sister chromatid exchange formation, This sensitization was further enhanced by combined treatment with antisense oligonucleotide and O- 6 -methylguanine, indicating that MGMT antisense can be supportive in sensitization of cells to an alkylating drug...|$|E

40|$|The {{cytotoxic}} and mutagenic {{properties of}} antitumor triazene compounds (TZC) have been mainly attributed {{to their ability}} to form DNA adducts at the O 6 position of guanine. Repair of these lesions is mediated by O 6 -alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (OGAT) in an autoinactivating reaction. Therefore when lesion repair has occurred, cells are depleted of OGAT until synthesis of new enzyme molecules takes place. In this study, we have evaluated the ability of DNA alkylated by different TZC to deplete OGAT activity. Moreover, we have also investigated whether these compounds might inactivate the OGAT enzyme by a direct reaction with the protein. Human OGAT protein was partially purified from insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus containing the human OGAT coding sequences. Thereafter human OGAT protein was exposed directly to TZC or to TZC-alkylated DNA. Among the TZC tested, p-(3 -methyl- 1 -triazeno) benzoic acid was the most effective OGAT inactivator by direct interaction with the protein. Moreover DNA substrates treated with methylating TZC, such as temozolomide or p-(3 -methyl- 1 -triazeno) benzoic acid, were more effective in depleting the repair enzyme, compared to DNA pretreated with the chloroethylating TZC <b>mitozolomide.</b> In conclusion, our results show that TZC inactivate in vitro OGAT activity by either direct or indirect mechanisms. Therefore TZC are good candidates for 1) increasing their own cytotoxicity, if used according to appropriate dose and treatment schedules and 2) reversing tumor cell resistance to O 6 -guanine alkylating agents...|$|E

Like compound 7, it was active on P-glycoprotein expressing cells (MDR) HL 60 and on K 562 cell line that are resistant to apoptosis induced by different stimuli, showing GI 50 values of 14 and 18 µM respectively. As an antiproliferative agent against the above cells compound 10 was about 2. 2 times more active than compound 7. Compound 10 was also tested against WiDR cells which are overexpressing the DNA repair protein MGMT, showing a GI 50 value of 2. 3 µM. Finally, concerning the effect on cell cycle we observed an evident difference between compounds 7 and 10. In fact, compound 7 induces a block of cell cycle in G 0 -G 1, therefore acting as phase-specific drug, in contrast, compound 10 is a not phase-specific agent.

40|$|The imidazotetrazinones are {{clinically}} active antitumour agents, temozolomide currently proving {{successful in}} the treatment of melanomas and gliomas. The exact nature of the biological processes underlying response are as yet unclear. This thesis attempts to identify the cellular targets important to the cytotoxicity of imidazotetrazinones, to elucidate the pathways by which this damage leads to cell death, and to identify mechanisms by which tumour cells may circumvent this action. The levels of the DNA repair enzymes O 6 -alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase (O 6 -AGAT) and 3 -methyladenine-DNA-glycosylase (3 MAG) have been examined in a range of murine and human cell lines with differential sensitivity to temozolomide. All the cell lines were proficient in 3 MAG despite there being 40 -fold difference in sensitivity to temozolomide. This suggests that while 3 -methyladenine is a major product of temozolomide alkylation of DNA it is unlikely to be a cytotoxic lesion. In contrast, there was a 20 -fold variation in O 6 -AGAT levels and the concentration of this repair enzyme correlated with variations in cytotoxicity. Furthermore, depletion of this enzyme in a resistant, O 6 -AGAT proficient cell line (Raji), by pre-treatment with the free base O 6 -methylguanine resulted in 54 % sensitisation to the effects of temozolomide. These observations have been extended to 3 glioma cell lines; results that support the view that the cytotoxicity of temozolomide is related to alkylation at the O 6 -position of guanine and that resistance to this drug is determined by efficient repair of this lesion. It is clear, however, the other factors may influence tumour response since temozolomide showed little differential activity towards 3 established solid murine tumours in vivo, despite different tumour O 6 -AGAT levels. Unlike <b>mitozolomide,</b> temozolomide is incapable of cross-linking DNA and a mechanism by which O 6 -methylguanine may exert lethality is unclear. The cytotoxicity of the methyl group may be due to its disruption of DNA-protein interactions, or alternatively cell death may not be {{a direct result of the}} alkyl group itself, but manifested by DNA single-strand breaks. Enhanced alkaline elution rates were found for the DNA of Raji cells treated with temozolomide following alkyltransferase depletion, suggesting a relationship between O 6 -methylguanine and the induction single-strand breaks. Such breaks can activate poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase (ADPRT) an enzyme capable of rapid and lethal depletion of cellular NAD levels. However, at concentrations of temozolomlde relevant in vivo little change in adenine nucleotides was detected in cell lines, although this enzyme would appear important in modulating DNA repair since inhibition of ADPRT potentiated temozolomide cytotoxicity in Raji cells but not O 6 -AGAT deficient GM 892 A cells. Cell lines have been reported that are O 6 -AGAT deficient yet resistant to methylating agents. Thus, resistance to temozolomide may arise not only by removal of the methyl group from the O 6 -position of guanine, but also from another mechanism involving caffeine-sensitive post-replication repair or mismatch repair activity. A modification of the standard Maxam Gilbert sequencing technique was used to determine the sequence specificity of guanine-N 7 alkylation. Temozolomide preferentially alkylated runs of guanines with the intensity of reaction increasing with the number of adjacent guanines in the DNA sequence. Comparable results were obtained with a polymerase-stop assay, although neither technique elucidates the sequence specificity of O 6 -guanine alkylation. The importance of such specificity to cytotoxicity is uncertain, although guanine-rich sequences are common to the promoter regions of oncogenes. Expression of a plasmid reporter gene under the control of the Ha-ras proto~oncogene promoter was inhibited by alkylation with temozolomide when transfected into cancer cell lines, However, this inhibition did not appear to be related to O 6 ~guanine alkylation and therefore would seem unimportant to the chemotherapeutic activity of temozolomide...|$|E
