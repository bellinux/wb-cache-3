500|$|David Calvert-Smith, for the prosecution, {{alleged that}} the detectives' {{supposedly}} contemporaneous notes of the fifth interview with Silcott had been altered after the fact to include the self-incriminating remarks. Silcott had refused to answer questions during the first four interviews. During the fifth, when told there were witness statements that he had struck Blakelock with a machete or similar, the notes show him saying: [...] "Those kids will never go to court. You wait and see. No one else will talk to you. You can't keep <b>me</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> them." [...] Silcott denied ever having said these words.|$|E
500|$|When Anderson first {{wrote the}} episode, {{she did not}} hint that Scully and Mulder had had sex. Spotnitz and the {{production}} crew, however, felt it was natural to suggest that Scully and Mulder's relationship may have evolved into a romantic one. The idea of heart chakra crop circles was included because Anderson wanted [...] "whatever Mulder was involved in that took him away from <b>me,</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Washington, to somehow tie into {{what it was that}} I was going through—the journey that I was going through". As such, Anderson dedicated much of her time researching both crop circles and heart chakras, but she later gave additional credit to Spotnitz, who she noted was also heavily involved during the researching process.|$|E
500|$|The notes {{show him}} asking: [...] "Who told you that?" [...] When the detectives {{said they had}} witnesses, he {{reportedly}} said: [...] "They are only kids. No {{one is going to}} believe them." [...] The notes say he walked around the interview room with tears in his eyes, saying: [...] "You cunts, you cunts," [...] and [...] "Jesus, Jesus," [...] then: [...] "You ain't got enough evidence. Those kids will never go to court. You wait and see. No one else will talk to you. You can't keep <b>me</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> them." [...] The notes show him saying of the murder weapons: [...] "You're too slow, man, they gone." [...] He was at that point charged with murder, to which he reportedly responded: [...] "They won't give evidence against me." ...|$|E

500|$|Kennedy {{made his}} first post-illness public {{appearance}} on July 9, when he surprised the Senate by showing up to supply the added vote to break a Republican filibuster against a bill to preserve Medicare fees for doctors. Though additionally ill from an attack of kidney stones and {{against the advice of}} some associates, Kennedy insisted on appearing during the first night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention on August 25, 2008, where a video tribute to him was played. Introduced by his niece, Caroline Kennedy, the senator said, [...] "It is so wonderful to be here. Nothing– nothing– is going to keep <b>me</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> this special gathering tonight." [...] He then delivered a speech to the delegates (which he had to memorize, as his impaired vision left him unable to read a teleprompter) in which, reminiscent of his speech at the 1980 Democratic National Convention, he said, [...] "this November, the torch will be passed again to a new generation of Americans. So, with Barack Obama and for you and for me, our country will be committed to his cause. The work begins anew. The hope rises again. And the dream lives on." [...] The dramatic appearance and speech electrified the convention audience, as Kennedy vowed that he would be present to see Obama inaugurated.|$|E
500|$|After {{the second}} verse and chorus, the song {{features}} a break down influenced by house music. Gaga chants {{the lines in}} the same way she does in the middle of [...] "Born This Way". Then she sings, [...] "I wanna love you/ But something's pulling <b>me</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> you/ Jesus is my virtue, Judas is the demon I cling to, I cling to." [...] In this section, Gaga's vocals drew comparison to that of Rihanna's by Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone. He also added that her voice sounded less dark and dramatic and was full of [...] "bubbly sweetness". Popjustice wrote that the breakdown sounded like tribal-techno, and the whole song was [...] "a turbo-charged electrogothic wrongness anthem". Dan Martin from NME wrote that the breakdown was in the dubstep genre with the chorus being [...] "pure-pop". There were some similarities and influences of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] in the song, which Gaga said was deliberate. She explained that while sometimes it is important for her to push herself in new directions, she did want her characteristic sound to be imbibed in her records. [...] "I wanted [...] to be an evolution from where I’ve been before {{but in terms of the}} formula I wanted there to be something about 'Judas' that reminded people of what I’ve done in the past," [...] she added. According to the sheet music published on Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is written in the time signature of common time, and is composed in the key of C minor with a tempo of 131 beats per minute. Gaga's voice ranges from the tonal nodes of B3 to E5 and the song follows a basic sequence of A–Fm7–Cm–B–Cm as its chord progression.|$|E

After appearing on I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! in 2003, Westbrook admitted that she no longer wanted to be a 'celebrity', commenting [...] "I made a pact with Kevin I would do no more TV work that would take <b>me</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> home. These days, I live an ordinary life. I work occasionally, but I also do the school run and laundry and prepare my family's dinner".|$|E
2500|$|On reflection, Hantuchová {{said that}} 2012 was a {{difficult}} year for her. She struggled with niggling injuries even before she fractured her foot and was forced out for two months. As a result, her form was inconsistent and she suffered ten first round defeats. She said: [...] "I think 2012 has been a difficult year for me. Had a great start to the season, making the final in Brisbane, winning in Pattaya and feeling very good about my game, but unfortunately, suffered a fracture stress... that kept <b>me</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the tracks for two months." [...] However, she said that playing in the Olympics at Wimbledon, where she reached the third round, was a [...] "special moment". In an interview {{at the end of}} the year, Hantuchová reflected on turning 30 the following April, saying that it was [...] "just a number" [...] and that she wanted to keep playing as long as possible and break back into the top 10.|$|E

2500|$|Hirst {{was born}} Damien Steven Brennan in Bristol {{and grew up}} in Leeds. He never met his father, with his mother marrying his {{stepfather}} when he was 2 and divorcing 10 years later. His stepfather was reportedly a motor mechanic. Hirst's mother who was from an Irish Catholic background worked for the Citizens Advice Bureau, and has stated that she lost control of her son when he was young. He was arrested on two occasions for shoplifting. However, Hirst sees her as someone who would not tolerate rebellion: she cut up his bondage trousers and heated one of his Sex Pistols vinyl records on the cooker {{to turn it into a}} fruit bowl (or a plant pot). He says, [...] "If she didn't like how I was dressed, she would quickly take <b>me</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the bus stop." [...] She did, though, encourage his liking for drawing, which was his only successful educational subject.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked how}} he beat his addictions, Cornell stated, [...] "It was {{a long period of}} coming to the {{realization}} that this way (sober) is better. Going through rehab, honestly, did help... it got <b>me</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> just the daily drudgery of depression and either trying to not drink or do drugs or doing them and you know, they give you such a simple message that any idiot can get and it's just over and over, {{but the bottom line is}} really, and this is the part that is scary for everyone, the individual kinda has to want it... not kinda, you have to want it and to not do that crap anymore or you will never stop and it will just kill you. There’s nothing you can do...if your best friend has a problem and it's very serious, there's nothing you're going to be able to do about it and it was sad for me and the people around me. Sad for me when friends of mine died because of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Diogenes {{arrived in}} Athens with a slave named Manes who {{abandoned}} him shortly thereafter. With characteristic humor, Diogenes dismissed his ill fortune by saying, [...] "If Manes can live without Diogenes, why not Diogenes without Manes?" [...] Diogenes would mock such a relation of extreme dependency. He found {{the figure of}} a master who could do nothing for himself contemptibly helpless. He was attracted by the ascetic teaching of Antisthenes, a student of Socrates. When Diogenes asked Antisthenes to mentor him, Antisthenes ignored him and reportedly [...] "eventually beat him off with his staff". Diogenes responds, [...] "Strike, for you will find no wood hard enough to keep <b>me</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> you, so long as I think you've something to say." [...] Diogenes became Antisthenes' pupil, despite the brutality with which he was initially received. [...] Whether the two ever really met is still uncertain, but he surpassed his master in both reputation and the austerity of his life. He considered his avoidance of earthly pleasures a contrast to and commentary on contemporary Athenian behaviors. This attitude was grounded in a disdain for what he regarded as the folly, pretense, vanity, self-deception, and artificiality of human conduct.|$|E
6000|$|Toby's eyes glistened at {{the thought}} of the {{unexpected}} pleasure, and then his face grew sad as he replied, [...] "I'd like to come first rate, Mr. Treat, but I don't s'pose Mr. Lord would let <b>me</b> stay <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the shop long enough." ...|$|R

2500|$|Having {{joined the}} D'Oyly Carte Opera Company as {{principal}} tenor {{at the beginning}} of the 1975–76 season, Shovelton initially played [...] Tolloller in Iolanthe, Nanki-Poo in The Mikado, Colonel Fairfax in The Yeomen of the Guard, and later that season added the roles of Luiz in The Gondoliers and the Duke of Dunstable in Patience. In 1977 he added to his repertoire the roles of Cyril in Princess Ida and Box in Cox and Box when those works were revived. He played the Defendant in a special performance of Trial by Jury in 1978 at London's Middle Temple Hall to commemorate the Bar Musical Society's first hundred concerts. In April 1979 he left D'Oyly Carte to tour with several other former D'Oyly Carte singers in a group that he founded, The Gilbert and Sullivan Companions, and he took other singing assignments. In 1980, he rejoined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, continuing with them until the company closed in February 1982. Shovelton recalled the [...] "family spirit" [...] of the company, writing that this was necessary in a year-round touring company where [...] "singing takes <b>me</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> my wife and three young children for extended periods". Shovelton's first marriage was eventually annulled; the couple's children were Claire, Dominic and Bruno. During these years, he also appeared at the Birmingham Triennial Music Festival in 1977, among a few other concert appearances for various charities, also sometimes designing artwork for the benefits.|$|E
