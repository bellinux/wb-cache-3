50|$|A 17100 ha area {{covering}} Mount Koroyanitu and the Vaturu Dam catchment is the Koroyanitu/Vaturu Important Bird Area. It {{supports a}} population of vulnerable Shy Ground-dove and near threatened <b>Masked</b> <b>shining</b> <b>parrot.</b>|$|E
50|$|The palm thrives near {{rivers and}} in marshy areas and its buoyant fruit will often land {{in water and}} float until they find {{suitable}} places to grow. Remains of partially eaten M. vitiense fruit indicate that bats and the <b>masked</b> <b>shining</b> <b>parrot</b> also act as dispersal vectors.|$|E
50|$|A 40700 ha area {{covering}} the basin is the Sovi Basin Important Bird Area. The Important Bird Area area supports the largest protected populations {{of many of}} Fiji's restricted-range species, including the endangered Long-legged thicketbird, the vulnerable Pink-billed parrotfinch and Shy Ground-dove, and the near threatened <b>Masked</b> <b>shining</b> <b>parrot.</b>|$|E
50|$|The crimson <b>shining</b> <b>parrot</b> is a {{medium-sized}} parrot (45 cm) {{with a long}} tail and bright plumage. The head, breast and belly are covered in bright crimson-red, its back, wings and tail are green with hints of blue in the wing. It has a long winged appearance in flight, flying with undulating bouts of flaps and gliding. The species is very vocal; the chreiks and squawks of the crimson <b>shining</b> <b>parrot</b> are of a higher pitch {{than that of the}} red <b>shining</b> <b>parrot.</b> On Kadavu it is unlikely to be mistaken for the other species of parrot, the collared lory.|$|R
50|$|The <b>shining</b> <b>parrots,</b> Prosopeia, are a genus of parrots (family Psittaculidae).|$|R
50|$|The crimson <b>shining</b> <b>parrot</b> (Prosopeia splendens) is {{a parrot}} from Fiji. The species is endemic {{to the islands}} of Kadavu and Ono in the Kadavu Group. The species was once {{considered}} conspecific with the red <b>shining</b> <b>parrot</b> of Vanua Levu and Taveuni, but is now considered its own species. The species is sometimes known as the Kadavu musk parrot.|$|R
50|$|The <b>masked</b> <b>shining</b> <b>parrot</b> (Prosopeia personata) is {{a species}} of parrot in the family Psittaculidae. It is endemic to Viti Levu in Fiji. Its natural {{habitats}} are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical mangrove forests, subtropical or tropical moist montane forests, arable land, and rural gardens. It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|E
50|$|Today, the {{mountain}} and the area around Joske's Thumb are known as a habitat for many species of birds. Among the species that live near Joske's Thumb are many birds that are endemic to Fiji, including the <b>masked</b> <b>shining</b> <b>parrot,</b> the giant forest honeyeater, and the pink-billed parrotfinch, although parrotfinch sightings have declined significantly since the area was logged in the early 1980s. Joske's Thumb is also a historical nesting site for Falco peregrinus nesiotes, Fiji's endemic peregrine falcon.|$|E
50|$|The crimson <b>shining</b> <b>parrot</b> is {{a common}} forest species that has {{recently}} taken to entering gardens and agricultural land. Pairs forage for seeds and fruits. The species has not been observed nesting but {{is assumed to be}} a hole nester like red <b>shining</b> <b>parrot.</b> The species is considered to be Vulnerable by the IUCN due to its restricted range, habitat loss and the illegal trade in parrots.|$|R
40|$|Recently in this journal, Gregory & Dickinson (2012) {{replaced}} Prosopeia Bonaparte, 1854, {{the widely}} used and long-accustomed generic {{name for the}} Fijian <b>shining</b> <b>parrots,</b> with Pyrrhulopsis Reichenbach, 1850. This action was then followed in the influential Howard & Moore global checklist of birds (Dickinson & Remsen 2013 : 377) and the websites Avibase (2013) and TiF Checklist (2013). Gregory and Dickinson’s decision rested on information in Kashin (1978), which showed that G. R. Gray (1855) {{was the first to}} assign a type species to Pyrrhulopsis Reichenbach. Gray designated “Coracopsis? personata G. R. Gray, 1848 ”, one of the <b>shining</b> <b>parrots,</b> by subsequent monotypy. Until then, Prosopeia had been used for the <b>shining</b> <b>parrots</b> for most of the 20 th century into the 21 st, following Peters (1937 : 250, footnote). Gregory & Dickinson’s (2012) action nevertheless contravenes the purpose of Article 23. 2 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, hereafter “the Code”, which stresses that the Principle of Priority is not to be used to upset long-accepted names in their accustomed meaning. Because of this, we had been preparing an application to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature to conserve Prosopeia—until we discovered an evident error in Gregory & Dickinson’s argument. The apparent error, which makes application to conserve Prosopeia unnecessary, is explained here to affirm Prosopeia as the valid generic name for the <b>shining</b> <b>parrots...</b>|$|R
50|$|The genus is {{endemic to}} the islands of Fiji, {{although}} one species, the maroon <b>shining</b> <b>parrot,</b> has been introduced to Tonga. The three species are also sometimes known as musk parrots.|$|R
50|$|The maroon <b>shining</b> <b>parrot</b> (Prosopeia tabuensis) or red shining-parrot is {{a species}} of parrot in the family Psittaculidae. It endemic to the islands of Vanua Levu and Taveuni in Fiji and was {{introduced}} to the islands of southern Tonga in prehistoric times. The species is sometimes considered conspecific with the crimson shining-parrot of Kadavu. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and subtropical or tropical mangrove forests.|$|R
50|$|Nabukelevu is {{the only}} area in west Kadavu Island that retains {{extensive}} old-growth forest. A 2900 ha area centred on Nabukelevu is the Nabukelevu Important Bird Area. It supports populations of vulnerable Collared Petrel and Crimson <b>shining</b> <b>parrot,</b> and near threatened Whistling fruit dove and Kadavu fantail. The Collared Petrel breeding site and unique landscape of the mountain contribute to its national significance as outlined in Fiji's Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan.|$|R
5000|$|Taveuni is {{also home}} to the Taveuni beetle, maroon <b>shining</b> <b>parrot,</b> Fiji goshawk, azure-crested flycatcher, Fiji white-eye, Fiji parrot finch, orange dove and the kula parrot, and the Australian magpie, {{introduced}} to control coconut pests, has proliferated on the island. The critically endangered red-throated lorikeet has been found here. In total 22 regional endemic bird species have been recorded on Taveuni. [...] The total number of bird species found on the island is closer to 100.|$|R
5000|$|The colour red was {{associated}} with nobility and power by Māori in New Zealand, so the bird was held in high esteem and held as a chiefly pet because of its red beak and legs. In Samoa, where it is called [...] "manuali'i" [...] (literally, [...] "chiefly bird"). Red was the prized color of Polynesian aristocracy and while birds with red plumage (such as the red-tailed tropicbird, some Hawaiian honeycreepers like the 'i'iwi' and maroon <b>shining</b> <b>parrot)</b> were highly prized, the swamphen was unique in deriving its prestige not from plumage but from its reddish face, beak, and legs. In old Samoa only chiefs could keep such birds as pets, and early European sailors noticed tethered and/or caged swamphens treated by Samoan chiefs as tamed pets. Some Samoans also considered the swamphen to be the incarnation of a mischievous, aggressive demon called Vave (Corey & Shirley Muse, [...] "The Birds and Birdlore of Samoa," [...] 1982). There is no tradition of swamphens being taken as sport game or poultry food, except perhaps in time of necessity.|$|R
50|$|While {{confronting a}} mysterious stalker in sunglasses, rock drummer Roberto Tobias (Michael Brandon) {{inadvertently}} stabs the man when the stalker {{pulls out a}} knife. A mysterious <b>masked</b> figure <b>shines</b> a spotlight on the incident and snaps several photographs. Roberto reads about the man's death in the newspaper the next day, and receives a letter identifying the man as one Carlo Marosi. During a recording session with his bandmates, Roberto's maid Amelia catches a glimpse of him with the photographs, but does not intervene.|$|R
50|$|The two set {{out from}} Ta-Koro {{the next day with}} Takua's pet Ussal crab Pewku, {{counting}} on the <b>mask</b> to <b>shine</b> most brightly in the direction they are supposed to go. However, Makuta fears the Toa of Light and sends out three of his Rahkshi to claim the mask. The Rahkshi arrive at Ta-Koro and decimate the village, with Lerahk poisoning Tahu in the process. The Ta-Matoran are able to escape with their lives, but Ta-Koro sinks into the lake of fire and is utterly destroyed.|$|R
50|$|Migliorisi {{presents}} a strong scenic sense, binding his creations to theatrical spaces. In his characters {{there is the}} mystery of the <b>masks</b> and the <b>shine</b> of footlight. The way he uses the color is a remarkable characteristic, the contrast, transparencies and textures give live to mud or metal objects. Emerge imposing plaster figures, woods of feather, glass pearls and golden stones and caracoles.|$|R
5000|$|Religious theatre plays {{about the}} Tibetan hermit Milarepa were already {{performed}} in the 18th and 19th centuries. The oldest Mongolian drama known today, [...] "Moon cuckoo" [...] (Saran khökhöö) was created by Danzanravjaa around 1831. The play {{got lost in the}} early 20th century, but in the meantime other theatre groups had developed. The first professional Mongolian theatre was founded in Ulaanbaatar in 1930. In the socialist period, every aimag got its own theatre. Since the 1990s, a number of small privately owned theatre companies, like <b>Mask</b> or <b>Shine</b> üe prodakshn have been founded. They heavily focus on light comedies and skits, and also regularly produce clips that are distributed on DVD or the internet.|$|R
60|$|After the {{appointment}} with Miss Merival reached him (through {{the hand of}} her manager), young Douglass grew feverishly impatient of the long days which lay between. Waiting became a species of heroism. Each morning he reread his manuscript and each evening found him at the theatre, partly to while away the time, but mainly in order that he might catch some clew to the real woman behind the <b>shining</b> <b>mask.</b> His brain {{was filled with the}} light of the star--her radiance dazzled him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I tell thee, Leo, {{that out}} of the confusions of our lives and deaths order shall yet be born. Behind the <b>mask</b> of cruelty <b>shine</b> Mercy's tender eyes; and the wrongs of this rough and twisted world are but hot, {{blinding}} sparks which stream from the all-righting sword of pure, eternal Justice. The heavy lives we see and know are only links in a golden chain that shall draw us safe to the haven of our rest; steep and painful steps are they whereby we climb to the alloted palace of our joy. Henceforth I fear no more, and fight no more against that which must befall. For I say we are but winged seeds blown down the gales of fate and change to the appointed garden where we shall grow, filling its blest air with the immortal fragrance of our bloom.|$|R
2500|$|Next {{on stage}} was the Thorleifs with [...] "Sweet Kissin' in the Moonlight", a nostalgic rock/pop/schlager entry. The band {{were dressed in}} {{matching}} white suits, with the lead singer in black. The five-piece band were later joined by three backing dancers in 1950s clothing, with red polka dot dresses and red braces. Sarah Dawn Finer followed with [...] "Moving On", dressed in red. The performance began with a sunrise being shown on the LED screens, with wind machines introduced at the chorus. Two male backing dancers in white joined afterwards, followed by three feamle backing singers, also in white. Finer was then raised by an automatic lift towards {{the side of the}} stage. The penultimate act was boyband Next 3 with [...] "Esta noche" [...] (Tonight), sung in Swedish, with the chorus in Spanish. The trio were joined by three female backing dancers and two fire jugglers for their performance, while the screens showed urban scenes. The final act was wild card Malena Ernman with opera song [...] "La voix" [...] (The voice), performed in English and French during the chorus. Ernman, dressed in a long black dress, was joined by seven backing dancers in black and white, who performed with black <b>shining</b> <b>masks</b> towards the end. the backing screens and floor were coloured in solid colours, with green and purple in the verses and white and blue during the chorus.|$|R
40|$|This {{project was}} meant as an {{emotional}} interpretation of Dionysus from Polaroid Stories by Naomi lizuka. I {{chose to do}} this project to further examine the characters in Polaroid Stories. Last quarter, I was {{given the opportunity to}} design makeup and costumes for Polaroid Stories and that is what lead to the design of Dionysus’s makeup based off of an emotional response. Polaroid Stories is a very visceral show. It specifically focuses on emotionally driven choices. The play narrates the transformation of characters due to their emotional driving factors. Being based off of Ovid’s Metamorphosis, the change of identity over time is reflected in each character in the show. The makeup design for Dionysus was a step within the transformation process, between man and snake. My first thought was that Dionysus hides his true self beneath the enticements he promised. I took that idea and decided that I wanted to create a makeup with a underlying deformity, but with a sheen, or <b>shine</b> <b>masking</b> the deformity. I, then, decided to add in the snake-like skin as a realization of his deformity. The process I used to achieve the makeup was via prosthetic design. To achieve the prosthetics, I first had to sculpt out of clay the scales and where they would live on the face. I, then, made a cast out of plaster, creating a negative of the clay designs. After the plaster dried, I removed the clay and poured in the liquid latex. After that was dried, I removed it from the mold and painted it...|$|R
