The broach is mounted in a special <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> that allows it to freely rotate. The <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> is special because it holds the tool so that its axis of rotation is inclined slightly to the axis of rotation of the work. A typical value for this misalignment is 1°. This angle is what produces a rotating edge for the broach to cut the workpiece. Either the workpiece or the <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> is rotated.

40|$|In {{the turning}} {{operation}} chatter or vibration {{is a frequent}} problem, which affects {{the result of the}} machining, and, in particular, the surface finish. Tool life is also influenced by vibration. Severe acoustic noise in the working environment frequently occurs as a result of dynamic motion between the cutting tool and the workpiece. These problems can be reduced by active control of machine-tool vibration based on high magnetostrictive actuators. However, both the physical features and properties of a active <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> construction based on high magnetostrictive actuators and the fact that this type of actuators generally have a non-linear behaviour highly reduce its applicability to the general lathe and turning operation. Therefor, a new generation embedded active <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> shanks based on piezo ceramic actuators have been developed. Based on spectrum estimates, both coherence spectrum and frequency response function estimates has been calculated for both the old <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> construction and the new generation active <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> shank. From the results it follows that the phase delay is smaller and the linearity of the new generation active <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> shank are superior compared to the old technology.

Prediction models and optimum values are very important for the machinist to save number of cutting tools and reduce machining time. This paper discussed the effect of the two different angles (90 ° and 70 °) of <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> on cutting force when machining aerospace material (Hastelloy C- 22 HS) in two different environments (dry and flood). The 90 o <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> is suitable to be used in rough machining, milling casting part, internal facing with low accuracy and others. It can be used in the condition of high cutting speed, high feed rate and high axial depth. On the other hand, the 70 o <b>tool</b> <b>holder</b> is more suitable for milling operation of final machining component, hard material, etc. Response surface method (RSM) was used to minimize the number of experiments. First order models were developed to optimize the machining parameters (cutting speed, federate and axial depth) and obtain the optimum cutting force. It observed that low value cutting parameters need to be used for 70 ° <b>tool</b> <b>holders,</b> meanwhile for 90 ° <b>tool</b> <b>holders</b> high value cutting parameters can be used.

40|$|The surface {{finishing}} technique called black oxidation {{is currently being}} used on the <b>tool</b> <b>holders</b> made of low alloyed tool steel produced by Sandvik Coromant. Black oxidation isn’t considered a sufficient technique because it doesn’t make the <b>tool</b> <b>holders</b> look like the quality products that they actually are. The reasoning behind {{this is that the}} <b>tool</b> <b>holders</b> can show signs of corrosion after prolonged storing times or in countries with high humidity and temperature. The corrosion doesn’t decrease the <b>tool</b> <b>holders</b> performance, but the customers might believe otherwise. After the black oxidation is performed the surface is oiled which can cause sticky surfaces that rubs off on the person handling the <b>tool</b> <b>holders</b> which is also {{something that needs to be}} avoided. The aim of this master thesis was to study potential substitutes to the current {{surface finishing}} technique, which could primarily improve the <b>tool</b> <b>holders</b> corrosion resistance and appearance.

The cost of some of the different surface finishing techniques has been studied as well, because in order to be interesting their price must match what improvements the technique provides with. A preliminary study was done where the surface finishing techniques that are available in the market has been examined. This has been a theoretical study which means that no experiments were performed and that most of the information available in this study has been obtained from literature and scientific articles. Companies that work with surface finishing has been contacted which shared information about both the theoretical and practical aspects of finishing techniques.
