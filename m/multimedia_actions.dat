First, {{the whole concept of}} wireless digital library can be broken down into peer grid nodes and <b>multimedia</b> data. Secondly, <b>actions</b> can be from groups and users. It can be further divided into basic operations and final operations, which forms objects in different abstraction levels of the system. This interface can be accessed by both the system administrator and other users. It has several operations on digital data such as, store, browse, copy, and retrieve.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{there are}} many kind of video such as {{educational}} movies, <b>multimedia</b> movies, <b>action</b> movies and scientific movies etc. The careful analysis and classification of movies are very important. For example, movies containing violent or profanity by putting a separate class as they are not suitable for children can cut and avoid from movies for watching. This system is proposed to provide indexing and retrieving the most interesting and important events of the action movie to attract the viewer by using the classified audio categories. The propose system is extracted audio features and make the model by using audio feature vector and classify the audio class to detect and recognize video scenes. In this proposed system, SVM is combined with HMM based on audio features which often directly reflects while image information may not yield useful “action” indexes, to be in detection scene by labeling happy scene, miserable scene and action scene etc. Sound event types are classified including gunshot, scream, car-breaking, people talking, laughter, fighting, shouting and crowd background...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAction {{classification}} {{and recognition}} is a challenging research {{area that has}} significant applications in computer vision domain including robotics, video surveillance, human-computer interaction and <b>multimedia</b> retrieval. <b>Action</b> classification domain uses a large variety of approaches. This paper proposes a new approach for video actions classification based on extension of Krawtchouk moments in spatio-temporal domain. In fact, Krawtchouk moments have interesting properties for describing structural and temporal information of a time varying video sequence. The proposed approach is composed of three main steps. First, the original video {{is transformed into a}} spatiotemporal volume of images. Then, silhouettes of human in movement are extracted from these images to define a 3 D shape. In the third step, higher order spatio-temporal Krawtchouk moments are applied to the obtained 3 D shapes and Laplacian eigenmaps is used to achieve dimension reduction for different moments vectors. Finally, we use SVM algorithm and computed descriptors to classify actions in videos. This new approach has been validated on the two video datasets Weizmann and KTH. Experimental results show a good classification rate compared to other approaches using different descriptors...|$|R
40|$|With the {{advancement}} {{in technology and}} availability of <b>multimedia</b> content, human <b>action</b> recognition has become a major area of research in computer vision that contributes to semantic analysis of videos. The representation and matching of spatio-temporal information in videos is a major factor affecting the design and performance of existing convolution neural network approaches for human action recognition. In this paper, in contrast to the traditional approach of using raw video as input, we derive attributes from action bank features to represent and match spatio-temporal information effectively. The derived features are arranged in a square matrix and used as input to the convolutional neural network for action recognition. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on KTH and UCF Sports datasets...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of Multimedia Titles (M-Titles), i. e. multimedia applications stored on CDs, is performed by many designers and implementors using tools which run on specific platforms and often have complementary and/or overlapping functionality. The potential designer or implementor of a M-Title is restricted by {{the availability of}} tools on a selected development platform. This paper presents a Multimedia Title Development Environment (MTDE) which integrates multimedia information, tools used to produce it, {{as well as their}} formats and storage media as objects in an Asset Repository. The cooperative construction of complex multimedia objects is modelled as a DAG consisting of two types of nodes: <b>multimedia</b> objects and <b>actions</b> applied to <b>multimedia</b> objects. A M-Title consists of a number of complex multimedia objects linked with each other in a hypernetwork of relationships.

40|$|To {{illustrate}} EPA’s {{approach to}} PBT pollutants under the PBT Strategy, the draft Mercury Action Plan is attached. This action plan focuses on regulatory and voluntary actions, enforcement and compliance, research, and outreach to characterize and reduce {{risks associated with}} mercury. It involves <b>multimedia</b> and cross-office <b>actions,</b> quantitative challenge goals, stakeholder engagement, international coordination, and long-term emphasis on pollution prevention. In these ways, the draft Mercury Action Plan {{is representative of the}} overall Agency approach to PBT pollutants. Nonetheless, mercury is different from other PBT pollutants in terms of the maturity of EPA’s knowledge base and program actions. Action plans for banned substances like canceled pesticides or PCBs, or for substances with less well characterized risk like octachlorostyrene, may differ significantly in substance and format from the action plan for mercury. Also, as the Agency moves forward in developing action plans for more PBT pollutants, opportunities will begin to appear for addressing multiple PBTs at a time, through orchestrated use of available multi-media, sector-based, and place-based approaches...|$|R
40|$|Feature {{selection}} {{is an effective}} way to reduce computational cost and improve feature quality for the large-scale multimedia analysis system. In this paper, we propose a novel feature selection method in which the hinge loss function with a ℓregularization term is used to learn a sparse feature selection matrix for each learning task. Meanwhile, shared information exploiting across multiple tasks has been also taken into account by imposing a constraint which globally limits the combined feature selection matrices to be low-rank. A convex optimization method is proposed to use in the framework by minimizing the trace norm of a matrix instead of minimizing the rank of a matrix directly. Afterwards, gradient descent is applied to find the global optimum. Extensive experiments have been conducted across eight datasets for different <b>multimedia</b> applications, including <b>action</b> recognition, face recognition, object recognition and scene recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than other compared approaches. Especially, when the shared information across multiple tasks is very beneficial to the multi-task learning, obvious improvements can be observed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an unorthodox solution to issues surrounding {{the validity of}} practice as research within the field multimedia composition. Firstly, it evaluates the process of multimedia composition leading to findings that the practice is similar to action research. Results are presented {{in the form of}} a model entitled The Multimedia Realisation Spiral, developed with the aid of Soft Systems Methodology. The purpose of the model is to be used as methodology in validating the practice of <b>multimedia</b> composition as <b>action</b> research. Secondly, the paper presents methodologies for multimedia composers to undertake evaluation of practice, practice-led research, and practice as research. Each methodology specifies the type of research output, ranging from papers to creative works and is tested for validity against extant literature from the research community. In summary, the paper presents some interesting findings; namely, that practice as research is not a valid form of research, along with several other points of discussion including a broad definition of multimedia composition and a useful model for teaching and learning purposes.

2500|$|Mplayer's first {{business}} model in online gaming was to charge gamers to play. However success was limited, {{and the company}} shortly after changed their marketing direction toward offering online play for free with supported advertising. The CEO of Mpath Interactive at the time, Paul Matteucci, put it: [...] "It wasn't until we really got it [...] that it was about building a community around the games [...] that Mplayer.com took off," [...] speaking on making the games free. It was from here that their model would begin to be based more around the actual community of gamers, and Mplayer would see its number of players climb several-fold. [...] Soon after, Mplayer had become a well-known player in the online gaming industry. As such, most of their marketing was geared toward attracting new gamers through a broader offering of games, as well as {{taking advantage of the}} large community they already had. The former {{can be seen in the}} hype surrounding the release of high-profile games of the time such as Unreal and Quake II, both of which were to be offered online through Mplayer.com. [...] They also used their Plus service to cater to the more hardcore gamers who did not mind the extra fee. One source describes their presence at E3 2000: E-3 2000, the Electronic Entertainment Expo, held at the Los Angeles Convention Center in May 2000, was a multimedia extravaganza. Nowhere was this more apparent than at the room-sized exhibit housing Mplayer.com, the premier on-line multiplayer gaming service. And, if the <b>multimedia</b> electronic <b>action</b> didn't grab your attention, the exhibit itself was sure to. Here was a mega multimedia presentation all its own. The exhibit, costing tens of thousands of dollars to design, fabricate, and install, occupied [...] on three raised floors, where fanatic gamers battled it out on a dozen big-screen overhead monitors...The design and construction represented an engineering marvel. [...] Nothing had been left to chance in the exhibit's design. [...] By creating such an extravagant exhibit at e3, the largest gaming exposition, they sent a message that Mplayer was a major player in the gaming industry. [...] Moreover, Even at this late date, months before the buyout by GameSpy, Mpath was still aggressively marketing Mplayer. This was despite criticisms that splitting off HearMe took the company's focus away from gaming.|$|R
40|$|Adherence to home-based {{musculoskeletal}} physiotherapy is {{less than}} optimal, which may lead to poor treatment outcomes. Physiotherapy adjuncts that increase patients’ self-efficacy and understanding of treatment facilitate rehabilitation adherence. The Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) that includes action and coping plans strengthens self-efficacy, while computer based patient education (CBPE) enhances patient understanding of treatment requirements when underpinned by the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning. This thesis evaluated the effect of CBPE developed using the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning and delivered in conjunction with action and coping plans on patient adherence to physiotherapy for shoulder injuries/disorders; {{and the value of}} extending the HAPA to include functional outcomes. The CBPE content was displayed using animations, videos, written text, and graphics, and included interviews with a physiotherapist and patient, exercise demonstrations, adherence hints, activities of daily living, information about the shoulder anatomy and pathologies, frequently asked questions and quizzes. A four week one group prospective pilot study (n = 20) assessed the effect of CBPE combined with action and coping planning on adherence to physiotherapy, the procedures for the main study, and the feasibility of extending the HAPA to include functional outcomes. After their first physiotherapy appointment participants completed questionnaires measuring the HAPA motivational variables (risk perception, outcome expectancies, action self-efficacy and behavioural intentions), shoulder knowledge and functional outcomes, and made action and coping plans. Throughout the study clinic- and home-based adherence were measured, and at the end participants completed questionnaires evaluating the HAPA volitional variables (maintenance and recovery self-efficacy, and adherence), knowledge and shoulder function. The HAPA variable scores were high with moderate to strong correlations between the behavioural intentions and self-efficacies, behavioural intentions and adherence behaviours, and adherence behaviours and post-study shoulder function. Participants’ shoulder function improved significantly during the study, and they valued the CBPE. The extended HAPA model incorporating functional outcomes was supported. The findings and feedback from the participants and physiotherapists led to changes to the CBPE programme, which included strategies to boost self-efficacy, less exercises, simpler terminology, diary page changes and increasing the Likert scale to 7 points for HAPA variables. The main study (n = 108) was an eight week two group randomised controlled trial, in which participants were allocated to either the combined CBPE planning group or the attention control group. This study tested the effect of the combination of CBPE and planning on rehabilitation adherence and shoulder function, evaluated the extended HAPA model, and validated the three-factor Rehabilitation Adherence Measure for Athletic Training (RAdMAT) as a measure of clinic-based adherence. The variables and their measurement timing were the same as the pilot study. The combined CBPE planning group had significantly higher levels of clinic-based adherence than the control and were highly satisfied with the programme. Moderately strong significant correlations occurred amongst all motivational stage HAPA variables, the three self-efficacies and behavioural intentions, the volitional self-efficacies and home-based adherence, clinic-based adherence and behavioural intentions, and clinic-based adherence and maintenance self-efficacy. Self-efficacy was the strongest predictor of behavioural intentions and home-based adherence. Significant moderately strong correlations existed between the RAdMAT and clinic- and home-based adherence measures. This thesis’ key findings are combining the CBPE programme underpinned by the Cognitive Theory of <b>Multimedia</b> Learning with <b>action</b> and coping plans enhances adherence; self-efficacy is associated with home-based adherence; relationships exist between adherence and functional outcomes; the HAPA can be extended to include functional outcomes; and the RAdMAT is a valid measure of clinic-based adherence...|$|R
