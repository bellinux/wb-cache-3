5000|$|This {{input method}} first became popular with {{accountants}} paper tape adding machines. It generally makes {{the assumption that}} entered numbers are being summed, although other operations are supported. Each number entered is followed by its sign (+/-), and a running total is kept.

50|$|In an age before {{widespread}} {{literacy and}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>printing,</b> {{it was common}} for all works, great and small, to borrow and copy from previous works without explicit attribution. The Preface of the Tractatus is commonly described as an admiring imitation of the Prœmium (Preface) to the Institutes of Justinian, with no negative implications of plagiarism. The Preface to the Institutes begins Imperatoriam Majestatem, but the Preface to the Tractatus begins Regiam Potestatem.|$|R
50|$|Vectographic {{prints and}} {{transparencies}} can serve {{many of the}} same purposes as their anaglyph equivalents, but with the visual advantage that they do not require the use of viewing filters which are of disturbingly different colors for each eye. However, while anaglyph images can be produced by virtually any photographic or <b>mechanical</b> <b>printing</b> process capable of producing a two-colored image, vectographic images require specialized materials and printing technologies, limiting their practical application.|$|R
50|$|With the {{invention}} of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>printing</b> press, the onset of the Renaissance {{and the rise of the}} Age of Reason, the need to document findings became a necessity, and inventors and scientists like Isaac Newton and Leonardo da Vinci prepared documents that chronicled their inventions and findings.

50|$|At {{the turn}} to the Renaissance, Gutenberg’s {{invention}} of <b>mechanical</b> <b>printing</b> made possible a dissemination of knowledge to a wider population, that would not only lead to a gradually more egalitarian society, but one more able to dominate other cultures, drawing from a vast reserve of knowledge and experience.

40|$|Product family design {{optimization}} {{is an important}} decision task {{in the early stages}} of product development. The extant optimization models for product family design assume that the known information for modeling can be determined precisely. However, many collected information for product design are prone to be imprecise due to the inherent uncertainty of human knowledge and expression. For example, when human experts estimate market demand of a product, imprecise information may be involved and influence the results of optimization. In this research, an optimization model with maximizing imprecise part-worth utility function is established for product family design problem. A linear programming embedded genetic algorithm is proposed to solve the proposed fuzzy optimization model. An industrial case of <b>printing</b> <b>calculator</b> product is used to illustrate the proposed approach. Experiments and sensitivity analysis based on the case study are also performed to analyze the relationship among the parameters and to explore the characteristics of the optimization model.

50|$|Modern lead-based movable type, {{along with}} the <b>mechanical</b> <b>printing</b> press, is most often {{attributed}} to the goldsmith Johannes Gutenberg in 1439. His type pieces, made from a lead-based alloy, suited printing purposes so well that the alloy is still used today. Gutenberg developed specialized techniques for casting and combining cheap copies of letter punches in the vast quantities required to print multiple copies of texts. This technical breakthrough was instrumental in starting the Printing Revolution and the first book printed with lead-based movable type was the Gutenberg Bible.|$|R

25|$|From {{the early}} 1900s through the 1960s, {{mechanical}} calculators dominated the desktop computing market (see History of computing hardware). Major suppliers in the USA included Friden, Monroe, and SCM/Marchant. (Some comments about European calculators follow below.) These devices were motor-driven, and had movable carriages where results of calculations were displayed by dials. Nearly all keyboards were full — each digit {{that could be}} entered had its own column of nine keys, 1..9, plus a column-clear key, permitting entry of several digits at once. (See the illustration below of a Marchant Figurematic.)One could call this parallel entry, by way of contrast with ten-key serial entry that was commonplace in mechanical adding machines, and is now universal in electronic calculators. (Nearly all Friden calculators, {{as well as some}} rotary (German) Diehls had a ten-key auxiliary keyboard for entering the multiplier when doing multiplication.) Full keyboards generally had ten columns, although some lower-cost machines had eight. Most machines made by the three companies mentioned did not print their results, although other companies, such as Olivetti, did make <b>printing</b> <b>calculators.</b>|$|R
