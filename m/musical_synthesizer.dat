50|$|The Extensible Embeddable Language (EEL) is a {{scripting}} {{and programming}} language in development by David Olofson. EEL {{is intended for}} scripting in realtime systems with cycle rates in the kHz range, such as <b>musical</b> <b>synthesizers</b> and industrial control systems, but also aspires to be usable as a platform independent general purpose programming language.|$|R
50|$|An audio filter is a {{frequency}} dependent amplifier circuit, {{working in the}} audio frequency range, 0 Hz to beyond 20 kHz. Audio filters can amplify ("boost"), pass or attenuate ("cut") some frequency ranges. Many types of filters exist for different audio applications including hi-fi stereo systems, <b>musical</b> <b>synthesizers,</b> sound effects, sound reinforcement systems, instrument amplifiers and virtual reality systems.|$|R

50|$|While some {{machines}} are called programmable, for example a programmable thermostat or a <b>musical</b> <b>synthesizer,</b> {{they are in}} fact just devices which allow their users to select among a fixed set of a variety of options, rather than being controlled by programs written in a language (be it textual, visual or otherwise).|$|E
5000|$|Synthetic {{instruments}} in test and measurement are conceptually {{related to the}} software synthesizer in audio or music. A <b>musical</b> instrument <b>synthesizer</b> synthesizes the sound of specific instruments from generichardware. Of course, {{a significant difference in}} these concepts is that <b>musical</b> instrument <b>synthesizers</b> typically onlygenerate <b>musical</b> sound, whereas a synthetic instrument in test and measurement may be equally likely to generate or to measure some signal or parameter.|$|R
50|$|Optical {{sound is}} a means of storing sound {{recordings}} on transparent film. Originally developed for military purposes, the technology first saw widespread use in the 1920s as a sound-on-film format for motion pictures. Optical sound eventually superseded all of other sound film technologies until the advent of digital sound became the standard in cinema projection booths. Optical sound has also been used for multitrack recording and for creating effects in some <b>musical</b> <b>synthesizers.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The Elektron SidStation is a <b>musical</b> <b>{{synthesizer}}</b> sound module, {{built around}} the MOS Technology SID mixed-mode synthesizer chip originally used in the Commodore 64 home computer. It was produced by the Swedish synthesizer company Elektron, and was introduced in 1999. As the SID chip had not been manufactured for years, Elektron allegedly bought up nearly all the remaining stock.|$|E
50|$|Physynth is a <b>musical</b> <b>synthesizer</b> {{application}} for Apple iPad series, and {{was launched in}} December 2011. Physynth is notable for being the first synth to prioritise visuals {{as part of the}} experience, using 3D gaming technology such as shaders and nVidia PhysX to drive the physics. The user can adjust pan, volume, rotation of 'soundscapes' and instruments such as glockenspiel, drums, piano, and other unusual sound generating devices.|$|E
50|$|Brown became {{serious about}} music {{in his teens}} and chose to learn the drums. His {{greatest}} inspirations in music {{at the time were}} Santana, Earth Wind and Fire and Chicago. He later became proficient playing timbales, conga drums, and a large number of other percussion instruments. Later, Brown was one of the pioneer users of the <b>musical</b> <b>synthesizer,</b> and for a time he was spokesman for the ARP Synthesizer company, since he used their products almost exclusively in performances and recordings. He has also been credited as being {{one of the founders of}} house music in the 1970s.|$|E

5000|$|The ARP Quadra was a 61 key analog <b>musical</b> <b>synthesizer</b> {{produced}} by ARP Instruments, Inc. from 1978 to 1981. The machine combined pre-existing products: the Omni, Odyssey, a Solina-esque string synthesizer unit, a phaser and a divide-down organ with ADSR envelope, and a 4075 24 db {{low pass filter}} into one box. It has four sections. Bass is on the bottom two octaves, has two unison bass circuits (electric and string), with AR and a single pole low pass filter and a related AD envelope for cutoff. A string section {{is similar to the}} ARP Omni. Poly Synth, and a two voice Lead Synth similar to the Odyssey and a five way mixer with four unit outputs, a stereo pair, a line mono and an XLR out.|$|E
5000|$|Melodia (voiced by Maggie Wheeler) - A musical {{mistress}} {{who serves}} as a nemesis and counterpart to the SilverHawks' Bluegrass, Melodia is the only female member of Mon*Star's Mob. Melodia is usually seen cruising around in the Limbo limo, causing havoc and assorted acts of terror as diversions. Melodia almost always carries a <b>musical</b> <b>synthesizer</b> called a [...] "Sound Smasher" [...] as a weapon. Her usual dressing are an exaggerated costume of a rock-singer: two-shaded green hair; a short black dress; red belt with plug up battery pack for [...] "Sound Smasher"; long red fingerless gloves; half dark purple, half light pink tights and; dark blue glasses with a red 'music note' frame (in contrast to Bluegrass' blue 'music note' frame). In [...] "Switch", while both Melodia and Bluegrass were under effect of a gas that temporarily turns good people into bad people and vice versa, Bluegrass {{was the one with}} a red music note frame and Melodia had a blue one. It's not specifically stated if that was another direct effect of the gas or if the weapons/instruments could be regulated into different colors.|$|E
5000|$|When Music of My Mind {{was first}} {{released}} on March 3, 1972, {{it became a}} modest success with {{both black and white}} audiences in the United States, charting at number six and number 21 on the Billboard R&B and pop charts, respectively. Contemporary critics viewed it as Wonder's final step into artistic maturity. In Rolling Stone, Vince Aletti said it showcased the ambitious use of his newfound artistic control and maturity as a songwriter, although he found some of the studio and vocal effects both gimmicky and self-indulgent. Robert Christgau from Creem believed that like Ray Charles, Wonder transcended aesthetic sensibilities on Music of My Mind, which he said featured [...] "some of the most <b>musical</b> <b>synthesizer</b> improvisations yet" [...] but whose individual songs were not as impressive as the [...] "one-man album" [...] concept. Penny Valentine was more enthusiastic in her review for Sounds, viewing the record as a milestone in modern music and a culmination of soul music's creative maturity. She especially praised Wonder's arrangement of [...] "intriguing vocal patterns" [...] on what she deemed [...] "an album of explosive genius and unshackled self-expression".|$|E
30|$|Although any perceivable sound can be {{synthesized}} by {{a digital}} computer [1], most sounds are generally considered {{not to be}} musically interesting, and many are even unpleasant to hear [2]. Hence, {{it can be argued}} that new music composers and performers are faced with a complex control problem--out of the unimaginably large wealth of possible sounds, they need to somehow specify or select the sounds they desire. Historically the selection process has been carried out using acoustic musical instruments, audio recording, direct programming, input controllers, <b>musical</b> <b>synthesizers,</b> and combinations of these.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the approach of}} physical modeling of a string <b>musical</b> <b>synthesizer,</b> a keyboard. Physical modeling uses numerical computation to create audio sounds. The different synthesizer technology used analog synthesis, frequency modulation, additive synthesis, sampling and physical modeling.

Finite difference models have been used in a couple of different settings with regards to physical modeling. Finite difference models are done by replacing derivatives in physical systems with finite differences...|$|E
40|$|I {{started this}} {{work with the}} hope of {{generating}} a text synthesizer (like a <b>musical</b> <b>synthesizer)</b> that can imitate certain linguistic styles. Most of the report focuses on text simplification using statistical machine translation (SMT) techniques. I applied MOSES to a parallel corpus of the Bible (King James Version and Easy-to-Read Version) and that of Wikipedia articles (normal and simplified). I report the importance of the three main components of SMT [...] -phrase translation, language model, and recording [...] -by changing their weights and comparing the resulting quality of simplified text in terms of METEOR and BLEU. Toward the end of the report will be presented some examples of text "synthesized" into the King James style...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} set of {{interaction}} techniques for electronic musical performance using a tabletop tangible interface. Our system, the Audiopad, tracks the positions of objects on a tabletop surface and translates their motions into commands for a <b>musical</b> <b>synthesizer.</b> We developed and refi ned these interaction techniques through an iterative design process, in which new interaction techniques were periodically evaluated through performances and gallery installations. Based on our experience refi ning the design of this system, we conclude that tabletop interfaces intended for collaborative use should use interaction techniques designed to be legible to onlookers. We also conclude that these interfaces should allow users to spatially reconfi gure the objects in the interface {{in ways that are}} personally meaningful.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the adaptation and parameterization of environmental auditory event structures {{for use in a}} real-time <b>musical</b> <b>synthesizer.</b> In doing so, we have developed a new software musical instrument based on the parametric representation of ecological sound structures, and which facilitates the application of typically non-musical auditory events in a musical context. Since this approach is to be realised within a low-latency, performance oriented synthesizer, our aim is not the development of computationally expensive physical models, but rather to effectively convey complex auditory events using arrays of simple sinusoidal components, while still retaining the key perceptual features of those events. By offering a performer ecologically-derived parameter control, we aim to encourage an Everyday Listening approach to electronic music performance, while also allowing the user to combine and develop typically unrelated elements of environmental auditory events...|$|E
