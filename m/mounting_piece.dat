The launch lock assembly comprises {{first and second}} <b>mount</b> <b>pieces,</b> a releasable clamp device, {{and a pair of}} retracting assemblies. Each retracting assembly comprises a pair of toothed members having interacting toothed surfaces. The releasable clamp device normally maintains the first and second <b>mount</b> <b>pieces</b> in clamped engagement. When the releasable clamp device is actuated, the first and second <b>mount</b> <b>pieces</b> are released from clamped engagement and one toothed member of each retracting assembly moves in an opposite direction relative to the other one toothed member of the other retracting assembly to define an axial gap {{on each side of the}} first <b>mount</b> <b>piece...</b>|$|R

40|$|In many {{sectors of}} the industry, the testing {{is a part of}} the {{production}} process. It prevents defective goods to appear on the market. Manually assemble automobile mirrors are tested to meet the minimal requirements of the producer and to reject badly <b>mounted</b> <b>pieces.</b> We decided to automate this process in order speed up and ensure the reliability of the testing. A special hardware was designed for this purpose. It is completely controlled by our application running on a regular PC. One of the improvements we have accomplished is a noticeable acceleration of the testing achieved by the parallel test execution. Development of this project contributes to the creation of a library for controlling industrial hardware...|$|R
30|$|During the {{biofeedback}} evaluation, {{the volunteers}} were not breathing into a spirometer. Instead, the spirometer was used during validation measurements beforehand, {{to determine a}} conversion factor from chest height to lung volume. When we attempted to use the spirometer during the feedback evaluation, some volunteers demonstrated difficulty in maintaining breath-hold because the <b>mount</b> <b>piece</b> prevented them from closing their mouth, {{as if they were}} not able to close their glottis. Moreover, the spirometer data showed a significant drift in the long-term measurements, even after rigorous (re)calibration of the spirometer, rendering these long-term spirometry data unusable. Of note, the spirometry measurements are not required for the system to function in clinical practice. These were performed only for validation of the system.|$|R

40|$|Our group {{developed}} two in vivo {{methods to}} study secretions from submucosal glands in exposed tracheal epithelium. (1) The exposed mucosal surface was coated with powdered tantalum; accumulated secretions produced elevations (hillocks) in the tantalum layer {{under which the}} duct openings were located. The rate of formation of the hillocks was observed through a dissecting microscope, and recorded by television on a video tape recorder. (2) Micropipets were used to collect timed samples from individual gland duct openings. With these techniques, the innervation of the submucosal glands and the autonomic regulation of their secretions were studied. We studied the control of ion movement across tracheal epithelium because active ion transport forms local osmotic gradients across epithelia which could regulate transepithelial water movement. We <b>mounted</b> <b>pieces</b> of the posterior wall of dog trachea in Ussing-type chambers and measured unidirectional fluxes of Cl- and Na+ under short-circuit conditions with 36 Cl and 24 Na. We found active transport of Cl- toward the lumen and Na+ toward the submucosa. With this technique we investigated the effect of parasympathomimetic drugs on ion movement. With a new in vitro method we studied output of 35 bhound to sulfated mucins and movement of ions in cat trachea. We <b>mounted</b> <b>pieces</b> of anterior tracheal wall in Ussing-type chambers, added sodium 35 S-sulfate to the submucosal side and monitored secretion of bound 35 S in samples from the luminal side after dialysis. The unidirectional fluxes of Cl- and Na+ were measured with 36 Cl and 22 Na. With this method we examined the effect of a-adrenergic and (-adrenergic agonists on mucin secretion and ion movement. Also with this preparation we studied {{the relationship between the}} permeability of the paracellular pathway to 14 C_ sucrose and the pattern of tight junction strands...|$|R

5000|$|Modern {{scientific}} {{evaluation of}} colloidal gold {{did not begin}} until Michael Faraday's work in the 1850s. In 1856, in a basement laboratory of Royal Institution, Faraday accidentally created a ruby red solution while <b>mounting</b> <b>pieces</b> of gold leaf onto microscope slides. Since he was already interested in the properties of light and matter, Faraday further investigated the optical properties of the colloidal gold. He prepared the first pure sample of colloidal gold, which he called 'activated gold', in 1857. He used phosphorus to reduce a solution of gold chloride. The colloidal gold Faraday made 150 years ago is still optically active. For a long time, {{the composition of the}} 'ruby' gold was unclear. Several chemists suspected it to be a gold tin compound, due to its preparation. [...] Faraday recognized that the color was actually due to the miniature size of the gold particles. He noted the light scattering properties of suspended gold microparticles, which is now called Faraday-Tyndall effect.|$|R
