Theoretically, such a system needs to enhance, within the organization, effectiveness, efficiency, responsabilisation, and goal-orientation. However, the <b>mandate</b> <b>system</b> within the Belgian Public Prosecution was introduced prematurely, for dubious reasons and in a precipitate manner. In the current situation, the position of the mandate holder is uncertain, with a bounded autonomy and a low wage increase. Moreover, it remains impossible to intervene in the policy of appointed heads of office (during their mandate), the efficiency and effectiveness is only increased in some prosecution offices and a contract containing actual management responsibilities is absent. In sum: there is a large gap between the theoretical principles of <b>mandate</b> <b>systems</b> and the way it is introduced in the Belgian Public Prosecution. </p...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} British strategies for social control during the Arab revolt in Palestine in 1936 - 39. It focuses {{specifically on the}} British discourse of criminality vis-à-vis the Arabs, {{and the ways in}} which this discourse related to British and Zionist representations of Arab Palestinian nationalism. Its primary finding is that British imperial discourse in the 1930 s necessitated that nationalist movements such as that for Arab Palestinian independence be criminalized in a particular manner. London tended in the nineteenth century to regard the nationalist movements within its colonial domains as essentially criminal enterprises. Given the terms of the post-WWI <b>mandates</b> <b>system,</b> however, the British were poorly positioned to suggest that Palestinian nationalists in general were criminally inclined. After all, the entire justification for the British presence in the Middle East was the shepherding of its peoples across the threshold of national autonomy. Thus, while the British undoubtedly practiced a form of colonialism in Iraq and Palestine/Transjordan, they did so on an anti-colonial pretext. When the movement for Palestinian national independence threatened their traditional colonial prerogatives in 1936 - 39, the British could neither plausibly deny the existence of Palestinian nationalism nor suggest that it amounted to mere criminality. In consequence, while privately acknowledging that they faced a nationalist uprising in the mandate, British officials publicly presented the rebellion as the work of a criminal minority masquerading as a national army. In this, they had the full support of mainstream Zionist opinion, both official and popular. By presenting the rebellion as a crime wave, both parties attempted to marginalize what the revolt sought to foreground: the Arab majority's case for national autonomy in Palestine. In neglecting to narrate the events of 1936 - 39 within this political context, previous histories of the Palestinian Great Revolt have often reproduced uncritically aspects of the British and Zionist criminological framing of the rebellion...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the American anti-colonial tradition's role {{in establishing the}} principle of international accountability for administering dependent peoples in the League of Nations mandates and the United Nations trusteeship systems. Where relevant, British ideas and schemes are compared with American ones {{in so far as}} this helps to understand the latter and where the final outcomes were based on Anglo-American compromises. It contributes to the literature on international relations in two main areas. First, it analyses the formulation, development and inter-relation of the American anticolonial tradition and international accountability. Second, it is the first study of the interplay of those two concepts within the context of differing Anglo-American views on creating the mandates and trusteeship systems. There are eight chapters. Chapter 1 introduces the main objectives and themes. Chapters 2 and 3, the conceptual heart of the thesis, examine imperial and colonial relationships, the American anti-colonial tradition, and international accountability for dependent peoples. Chapter 4 focuses on the interplay of those concepts and the American role in establishing the League <b>mandates</b> <b>system.</b> Chapters 5, 6 and 7 do the same regarding the United Nations trusteeship system. Chapter 7 also contains a postscript on trusteeship developments since 1945. Chapter 8 summarises the thesis' conclusions. Throughout, the methodological approach is analytical and historical rather than theoretical. The overall conclusion is that so long as the national interests of the United States were protected, the American anti-colonial tradition did play the major role in establishing the principle of international accountability within both the mandates and the trusteeship systems. The determination and anti-colonial sentiments of Presidents Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt were especially important. American policy was usually based on the right of all peoples to freedom; the practical application of this precept hastened the demise of Western European-style colonialism...|$|E
40|$|The {{financial}} {{crash of}} 2007 - 2008 brought words like ‘capitalism’, ‘capital’, and ‘socialism’ back in vogue. However, {{the discipline of}} international law remains to reflect systematically on {{its relationship with the}} ways in which wealth and power are produced and distributed. This thesis examines the relationship between international law, imperialism and capitalism through historical lenses, arguing that the diffusion of capitalist relations is a core function of international law. Analysing the nineteenth-century ‘standard of civilisation’, I contend that transforming (semi) colonised polities into centralised, territorialised states operating as guarantors of capitalist relations of production was {{at the core of the}} concept. Extraterritoriality in Japan and the Ottoman Empire serves as a case study to verify this statement and to highlight the transformative functions of the ‘civilising mission’. The <b>Mandates</b> <b>System</b> of the League of Nations established a system of partial internationalisation of this transformative process, while attempting to safeguard the long-term interests of capital through the introduction of limited forms of welfarism. My thesis then argues that decolonisation assumed the form of national statehood due to the transformative functions of nineteenth-century international law. Therefore, the attempt to push for a New International Economic Order was both a challenge to contemporary international law and a reaffirmation of its role in promoting capitalist relations on a global level. These reformist attempts did not succeed, however, and a new model of capitalist accumulation, neoliberalism, became hegemonic after 1990. The quantitative expansion and qualitative refinement of international law during that period was intrinsically linked to the neoliberal aversion to democratic and mass politics. The neoliberal reconstruction of Iraq in the aftermath of the 2003 invasion is interpreted in the light of this reality. In so doing, my thesis highlights the ongoing synergies between international law and capitalist expansion. ...|$|E

50|$|Namibia was governed as German South West Africa, {{a colony}} of the German Empire, until World War I, when it was invaded and {{occupied}} by Allied forces under General Louis Botha. Following the Armistice of 11 November 1918, a <b>mandate</b> <b>system</b> was imposed by the League of Nations to govern African and Asian territories held by Germany and the Ottoman Empire prior to the war. The <b>mandate</b> <b>system</b> was formed as a compromise between those who advocated an Allied annexation of former German and Turkish territories, and another proposition put forward by those who wished to grant them to an international trusteeship until they could govern themselves.|$|R
40|$|After having {{occupied}} the formerly Ottoman Middle East during World War I, the Allies decided {{to establish an}} administration which {{would enable them to}} guarantee their interests in the region. In fact, during the war years they had (already) divided control of the lands of the Middle East in the secret Sykes-Picot Agreement of 1916, and before long they had {{occupied the}} region. According to this agreement, Iraq and Palestine were allotted to Great Britain’s dominion while Syria and the Hatay Province were allotted to France’s adminstration. As a matter of fact, two years after the founding of the postwar League of Nations in 1918, the system of judicial administration referred to as the <b>mandate</b> <b>system</b> gained recognition at San Remo, and a legal justification was found for the Allies’ occupation. According to this, France would administer Syria and Lebanon through a Hıgh Commisioner established in Beirut. Locally the people of the region would also participate in the administration, however the final word would belong to France. The <b>mandate</b> <b>system</b> would continue until the people reached the level where they could governthemselves. At first a 15 year period was projected for this to occur. Consequently, from 1921 France began ruling Syria, the Hatay Province, and Lebanon as a mandatory power responsible to the League of Nations. The independence negotiations in 1936 had produced no outcome, but with the founding of the Hatay state through Turkey’s intervention in 1938, the first break/rupture from the <b>mandate</b> <b>system</b> had begun. The <b>mandate</b> <b>system</b> continued until 1946 when Syria and Lebanon gained independence...|$|R
40|$|At a {{time when}} New Zealand's {{attempts}} to govern peacefully the mandated territory of Western Samoa are giving rise to comments and contentions {{in many parts of}} the world, and when her ability and indeed her right to administer the islands are being questioned, it seems not unnatural to enquire why New Zealand should have been given a mandate over Western Samoa. To answer this question it is necessary to go back to an early period in New Zealand history and trace the thread up to and through the maze of complexities which constitute the peace negotiations of 1918 - 1919. We see New Zealand emerge from the Peace Conference with a C mandate, not exactly her heart's desire, but something very nearly akin. At this stage another thought arises; has the “sacred trust” been accepted gladly or has New Zealand chafed at the restrictions and obligations of the mandate? In this thesis I have endeavoured to depict the part played by New Zealand in the establishment and working of the <b>mandates</b> <b>system,</b> by a consideration of the motives underlying her policy at the Peace Conference, her expressed intentions in regard to Western Samoa, and her attitude towards the whole system as shown by official despatches, and official utterances made to the League, the New Zealand Parliament and elsewhere. An assessment of the merit or demerit of her performance as a mandatory power has been sought in the opinions expressed by the League organs whose task it is to supervise her work. I feel that the years during which she is a mandatory power will constitute an important phase in New Zealand history, for while occupying this position she is being tested, not only in regard to her capabilities in the sphere of native administration but, what is more vital, in her ability to respond to the new ideal of trusteeship which has somehow managed to survive in a world where exploitation is the rule, and which is making definite claims on behalf of Western Samoa to those who will hearken in New Zealand...|$|E

40|$|After World War I, reallocating {{the former}} German and Turkish colonies {{proved to be}} one of the more {{challenging}} feats of the peace process. After months of negotiation in 1919, first in Paris, then in London, the various national leaders agreed to create the <b>mandate</b> <b>system,</b> which proved to be a compromise between outright colonial expansion and genuine independence, whereby the former German and Turkish colonies in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East were mandated to the conquering nations in trust until the indigenous peoples were deemed ready to administer their own governments and societies. For decades, the <b>mandate</b> <b>system</b> was viewed by scholars as a genuine departure from the traditional forms of European colonialism so prevalent in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. ^ This study departs from previous interpretations while accounting for the key contributions from past scholars, providing both new direction and new conclusions. The analysis is largely philosophical in nature, tracing the primary American role in developing the mandates, while examining the developmental ideas behind Wilsonian principles such as national self-determination. Moreover, though Wilson himself is crucial to the study, the historical lens is primarily Edward M. House, who was Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s most trusted advisor, with a particular aptitude in the realm of foreign affairs. House was instrumental in forming the <b>mandate</b> <b>system</b> from 1917 through 1919. ...|$|R
