Others disagreed, {{asserting that the}} lyrics supported female power and sexual freedom. Martel defended Ratajkowski's performance, saying: [...] "it's very, very funny and subtly ridiculing." [...] Ratajkowski {{did not think of}} the video as sexist and claimed that the producers, through the use of humor and sarcasm, [...] "took something that on paper sounded really sexist and misogynistic and made it more interesting". She said that the song [...] "gave <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to say the things that I felt about feminism today and about women in general in pop culture." [...] Ratajkowski did not feel objectified and enjoyed performing in a sexual manner: the attention given to the nudity in the video, she said, shows that America has not advanced as far as it should have, and, she believes, society represses sexuality, which is bad for both sexes.|$|E

His opponent, Bryce J. Saunders charged that the city had long lacked efficiency in its utilities, particular the water supply, which he believed in the public ownership of. Armstrong would later go on to defeat Saunders in the general election, 1791 votes to Saunders' 1072, a margin of just over 700, with a voter turnout of around 30 percent.|$|E
500|$|The Spanish {{media has}} often {{compared}} Villa with Raúl, {{to the point}} where Villa was accused of taking the number 7 jersey away from the then-Real Madrid player. In March 2009, Villa spoke out, saying, [...] "I have not taken anything away from anybody, I was simply playing well for my club and the national coach gave <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity.</b> Too much has been said about the number issue. I’m not looking to cause any controversy. In fact, Raúl and I were in the national squad together in the past. I haven’t forced anybody out." [...] When questioned on whether the whole uproar created over Raúl's omission was affecting him personally, he said, [...] "I've never liked it because I think it has been damaging for the both of us. We've always got on well together whenever we've met up for international duty, so I'm not concerned. I just work hard for myself. All I want is to be in the squad for every game, to have the Spain badge on my chest and to score as many goals as I can." ...|$|E

In 2005, he was featured on People's 50 Most Beautiful People, and in 2006 he was named the NBA's best-dressed player by GQ Magazine. In 2007, Esquire named him to their 4th annual Best Dressed Men in the World list for the second straight year. Wade has endorsement deals with companies such as Gatorade, Lincoln, Staples, Sean John, T-Mobile (his TV commercials feature him paired with NBA legend Charles Barkley), and Topps. He had his own line of shoes with Converse named [...] "The Wade" [...] and a series of Sidekick phones known as the D-Wade Edition with T-Mobile. During the 2009–10 season, Wade switched from Converse to Nike's Jordan Brand. Wade noted that the partnership ended on good terms, stating, [...] "When I came into the NBA, I didn't have a lot of exposure and Converse gave <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to head a brand and be the face of a brand. I'm really thankful for six long, good years. I've gotten five shoes out of the deal and my dream came true at the Converse brand because they put my name on a pair of sneakers." [...] Wade was hand-chosen by Michael Jordan and debuted the Air Jordan 2010 during the 2010 NBA All-Star break. During the 2011 NBA Playoffs, Wade debuted his first signature shoe for the Jordan Brand, joining fellow players Carmelo Anthony and Chris Paul, who have their own signature shoes for the brand. After his Jordan Brand contract expired in 2012, Wade signed with the Chinese athletic brand Li-Ning.|$|E
500|$|Gosling {{came to the}} {{attention}} of a mainstream audience in 2004 after starring opposite fellow Canadian Rachel McAdams in the romantic drama film The Notebook, a film adaptation of Nicholas Sparks' novel of the same name, directed by Nick Cassavetes. Gosling portrayed Noah Calhoun and commented on the role: [...] "It gave <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to play a character over a period of time – from 1940 to 1946 – that was quite profound and formative." [...] Gosling sought to imbue his character with [...] "quiet strength" [...] and was inspired by the performance of Sam Shepard in Days of Heaven. Shepard co-starred in The Notebook. Filming took place in Charleston, South Carolina, in late 2002 and early 2003. Although Gosling and McAdams became romantically involved in 2005, they had a combative relationship on the set. [...] "We inspired the worst in each other," [...] Gosling has said. [...] "It was a strange experience, making a love story and not getting along with your co-star in any way." [...] At one point, Gosling asked Cassavetes to [...] "bring somebody else in for my off-camera shot" [...] because he felt McAdams was uncooperative. The New York Times praised the [...] "spontaneous and combustible" [...] performances of the two leads and noted that, [...] "against your better judgment, you root for the pair to beat the odds against them." [...] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post praised Gosling's [...] "beguiling unaffectedness" [...] and noted that [...] "it's hard not to like these two or begrudge them a great love together". The film grossed over $115 million worldwide. Gosling won four Teen Choice Awards and an MTV Movie Award. Entertainment Weekly has said that the movie contains the All-Time Best Movie Kiss while the Los Angeles Times has included a scene from the film in a list of the 50 Classic Movie Kisses. The Notebook has appeared on many Most Romantic Movies lists.|$|E

[...] He [...] "took to the streets" [...] to celebrate the 1948 election in which the pro-apartheid National Party won the most seats (despite losing the popular vote). [...] Smith spent seven years at the University of Pretoria where he earned his theology degree. [...] He was ordained a minister of the apartheid-supporting Dutch Reformed Church. [...] Smith spent a 7-year period doing missionary work in the black homeland of Venda, where he saw the gap between white and black in South African society up close. [...] He then spent three years performing staff work at the Dutch Reformed Church headquarters in Pretoria. [...] While in Pretoria he received an invitation to join the prestigious Afrikaner Broederbond, which included many of the elites of Afrikaner society and government. [...] Smith would later say of his 10-year membership of the Brotherhood that he was [...] "thankful that God gave <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to discover {{what was going on in}} the hearts and minds of Afrikaners."

2500|$|The {{discovery}} of {{the wreckage of the}} R.M.S. Titanic in 1985 attracted Yeston's interest in writing a musical about the famous disaster. [...] "What drew me to the project was the positive aspects of what the ship represented – 1) humankind's striving after great artistic works and similar technological feats, despite the possibility of tragic failure, and 2) the dreams of the passengers on board: 3rd Class, to immigrate to America for a better life; 2nd Class, to live a leisured lifestyle in imitation of the upper classes; 1st Class, to maintain their privileged positions forever. The collision with the iceberg dashed all of these dreams simultaneously, and the subsequent transformation of character of the passengers and crew had, it seemed to me, the potential for great emotional and musical expression onstage." [...] Librettist Peter Stone and Yeston knew that the idea was an unusual subject for a musical. [...] "I think if you don't have that kind of daring damn-the-torpedoes, you shouldn't be in this business. It's the safe sounding shows that often don't do well. You have to dare greatly, and I really want to stretch the bounds of the kind of expression in musical theater," [...] Yeston explained. [...] Yeston saw the story as unique to turn-of-the-century British culture, with its rigid social class system and its romanticization of progress through technology. [...] "In order to depict that on the stage, because this is really a very English show, I knew I would have to have a color similar to the one found in the music of the great composers at that time, like Elgar or Vaughan Williams; this was for <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> to bring in the musical theater an element of the symphonic tradition that I think we really haven't had before.
