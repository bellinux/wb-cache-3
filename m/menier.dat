25|$|Among the {{families}} who settled in Puerto Rico were the Beauchamps. Francois Joseph Beauchamp <b>Menier,</b> from St. Nazaire, France, {{was a member of}} the French Army stationed in Saint-Domingue (Haiti) with his family during the slave revolution. When the French ranks were disbanded he boarded a ship bound for Martinique, together with his wife Elizabeth Sterling and children. The boat however ran ashore in Puerto Rico instead of reaching Martinique. The Spanish government offered Beauchamp <b>Menier</b> land to cultivate and the family settled in the town of Añasco.|$|E

25|$|The musical won the 1985 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, two Tony Awards {{for design}} (and a {{nomination}} for Best Musical), numerous Drama Desk Awards, the 1991 Olivier Award for Best Musical and the 2007 Olivier Award for Outstanding Musical Production.

25|$|When {{switching}} {{to the use}} of national teams in 1930, the costs of accommodating riders fell to the organizers instead of the sponsors and Henri Desgrange raised the money by allowing advertisers to precede the race. The procession of often colourfully decorated trucks and cars became known as the publicity caravan. It formalised an existing situation, companies having started to follow the race. The first to sign to precede the Tour was the chocolate company, <b>Menier,</b> one of those who had followed the race. Its head of publicity, Paul Thévenin, had first put the idea to Desgrange. It paid 50,000 old francs. Preceding the race was more attractive to advertisers because spectators gathered by the road long before the race or could be attracted from their houses. Advertisers following the race found that many who had watched the race had already gone home. <b>Menier</b> handed out tons of chocolate in that first year of preceding the race, as well as 500,000 policemen's hats printed with the company's name. The success led to the caravan's existence being formalised the following year.|$|E
40|$|Background. Neisseria meningitidis is a {{frequent}} colonizer of the human nasopharynx with asymptomatic carriage providing the reservoir for invasive, disease-causing strains. Serogroup Y (<b>MenY)</b> strains are {{a major cause of}} meningococcal disease. High resolution genetic analyses of carriage and disease isolates can establish epidemiological relationships and identify potential virulence factors. Methods. Whole genome sequence data were obtained from UK <b>MenY</b> carriage isolates from 1997 - 2010 (n= 99). Sequences were compared to those from <b>MenY</b> invasive isolates from 2010 and 2011 (n= 73) using a gene-by-gene approach. Results. Comparisons across 1, 605 core genes resolved 91...|$|R

25|$|Henri <b>Menier</b> died in 1913 and {{his brother}} Gaston became the owner of Anticosti Island. He used and {{maintained}} it for a time but eventually decided {{it was not an}} economically viable operation and sold it to the Wayagamack Pulp and Paper Company in 1926 for $6,000,000. For the next five decades, the island was used almost exclusively by logging companies which invested nothing in environmental or heritage protection, while the villages at English Bay and Fox Bay were abandoned.|$|E
25|$|The show's first revival was {{presented}} at the <b>Menier</b> Chocolate Factory in London, opening on November 14, 2005, and closing on March 17, 2006. The score was radically reorchestrated by Jason Carr and starred Daniel Evans and Anna-Jane Casey, with direction by Sam Buntrock. The production transferred to the Wyndham's Theatre in London's West End, opening on May 23, 2006, and closing on September 2, 2006. Jenna Russell replaced the unavailable Casey. The revival received six Olivier Award nominations overall, and won five in total including Outstanding Musical Production, Best Actor in a Musical and Best Actress in a Musical.|$|E
40|$|Recently the {{incidence}} of meningococcal serogroup Y (<b>MenY)</b> and in particular serogroup W (MenW) invasive disease has risen in several European countries, including the Netherlands. Adolescents are a target group for primary prevention through vaccination to protect against disease and reduce carriage and induce herd protection in the population.

25|$|The {{family had}} {{thirteen}} children, {{including those who}} were born in Saint-Domingue (Santo Domingo, today). It is believed {{that all of the}} Beauchamps in Puerto Rico are descendants of Francois Joseph Beauchamp <b>Menier</b> and Elizabeth Sterling. The Beauchamp family was active in Puerto Rican politics. Among the notable members of this family are Eduvigis Beauchamp Sterling, named Treasurer of the revolution against Spanish colonial rule known as El Grito de Lares by Ramón Emeterio Betances. He was the person who provided Mariana Bracetti with the materials for the Revolutionary Flag of Lares. Pablo Antonio Beauchamp Sterling was a principal leader of the Mayagüez cell during the Lares Revolution. In the early 20th century another member of the family was {{an active member of the}} Puerto Rican independence movement, he was Elías Beauchamp, a member of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party who assassinated Colonel Francis Riggs in 1936 in retribution of the events of the Río Piedras massacre. Carlos María Beauchamp Giorgi served as Mayor of Las Marias and Ramón Beauchamp Gonzáles was the Secretary of the Senate in 1916.|$|E

For cases diagnosed in 2009, patient median age at disease onset was 60 years; 39 % of patients had underlying medical conditions, and 19 % died. <b>MenY</b> isolates causing invasive disease during 2007 - 2009 belonged mainly to 1 of 4 clonal complexes (cc), cc 23 (56 % of isolates), cc 174 (21 %), cc 167 (11 %), and cc 22 (8 %). The 2009 increase resulted primarily from sequence type 1655 (cc 23) (22 cases in 2009, compared with 4 cases each in 2007 and 2008). cc 23 was associated with lpxL 1 mutations and meningitis in younger age groups (65 years).

2500|$|In 1895, Anticosti {{was sold}} for $125,000 to French {{chocolate}} maker Henri <b>Menier</b> who also leased the shore fishing rights. <b>Menier</b> named the island's [...] high Vauréal Falls after {{the town of}} Vauréal in France where he owned a home. He constructed the entire village of Port-Menier, built a cannery for packing fish and lobsters, and attempted to develop its resources of lumber, peat and minerals. Many of the original houses still stand today. Furthermore, he converted the island into a personal game preserve and introduced nonindigenous animals for this purpose, including a herd of 220 white-tailed deer. The deer thrived and today the population exceeds 160,000 while the island's moose population is about 1,000. It {{has been reported that}} black bears, which rely on berries to bulk on for the winter, had lived on the island until the introduction, but have disappeared perhaps because of the deer eating the berry bushes bare.|$|E
