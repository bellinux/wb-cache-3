25|$|Raw kiwifruit {{contains}} actinidain (also spelled actinidin) {{which is}} commercially {{useful as a}} <b>meat</b> <b>tenderizer</b> and possibly as a digestive aid. Actinidain also makes raw kiwifruit unsuitable for use in desserts containing milk or any other dairy products because the enzyme digests milk proteins. This applies to gelatin-based desserts, as well, as the actinidain will dissolve the proteins in gelatin, either liquefying the dessert or preventing it from solidifying.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA rapid {{overview}} of the Three Phase Partitioning (TPP) system as an efficient non-chromatographic tool is given. This elegant non-chromatographic tool is able to purify numerous proteins and especially proteases in a one step protocol. TPP {{is able to do}} not only purify proteins, but also concentrate them into one of the phases and enhance their proteolytic activity. The application of TPP for the extraction and purification of plant milk-clotting enzymes and <b>meat</b> <b>tenderizers</b> agents are given. In addition, some proteases from other materials are summarized. This short communication stress showed that TPP is a simple, economical and quick method for proteases recovery from plant proteases.

40|$|Papain is a plant {{proteolytic}} enzyme for the cysteine proteinase family cysteine protease enzyme in which enormous {{progress has been}} made to understand its functions. Papain is found naturally in papaya (Carica papaya L.) manufactured from the latex of raw papaya fruits. The enzyme is able to break down organic molecules made of amino acids, known as polypeptides and thus plays a crucial role in diverse biological processes in physiological and pathological states, drug designs, industrial uses such as <b>meat</b> <b>tenderizers</b> and pharmaceutical preparations. The unique structure of papain gives it the functionality that helps elucidate how {{proteolytic enzyme}}s work and also makes it valuable for a variety of purposes. In the present review, its biological importance, properties and structural features that are important to an understanding of their biological function are presented. Its potential for production and market opportunities are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Studies on meat aging have {{comprehensively}} been reviewedl- 3) {{during the}} past years. The common belief is that the aging has profound effect on myofibrils. Many past studies were concerned with the interaction of actin and myosin {{in the region of}} thick and thin filament overlap. The consensus is that if rigor linkages between these two sets of protein were weakened, meat would become more tender 4 - 5). But, an alternative view has also been postulated which suggests that the aging is due to disintegration of the Z lines of sarcomeres leading to the loss in tensile strength of myo-fibrils and to increased tenderness in cooked meat 7 - 8). Despite these inten-sive studies any direct correlation between structural and tenderness changes is still very much a mystery. Attempts to make meat artificially tender have consistently progressing. The discoveries that certain plants, fungi and bacteria produce non-toxic proteolytic enzymes was followed by their enlistment as commercial <b>meat</b> <b>tenderizers</b> 10 l • Among them papain has helped the muscle biochemists t...|$|R
40|$|Treball Final de Grau en Grau en Química. Codi: QU 0943. Curs: 2013 / 2014 In this work, we {{are going}} to talk about the {{cysteine}} proteases. In the cysteine proteases, or thiol proteases, the mechanism involves a nucleophilic thiol in a catalytic triad or dyad. Cysteine proteases are common in fruits and are used as an ingredient in <b>meat</b> <b>tenderizers.</b> The mechanism of action of a cysteine protease, can be described in detail in this way 1; the thiolate anion attacks the carbonyl carbon of the peptide bond to be cleaved and a tetrahedral intermediate is produced (step a of figure 1). The oxyanion is fixed by an oxyanion hole. Stabilization of this transition state occurs by H bonding to the backbone NH of cysteine and the NH 2 group of the histidine. Then, esterification of the thiol makes the imidazolium ion sufficiently acidic to protonate the nitrogen of the leaving group and the acyl enzyme is produced. In order to donate this proton to the amide nitrogen, rotation of the active site histidine is necessary. Deacylation may occur via a general base-catalyzed mechanism, whereby the imidazole nitrogen polarizes a water molecule which then attacks the acyl enzyme at the carbonyl carbon. The cleaved substrate (as free acid) and the regenerated enzyme are produced via a second tetrahedral intermediate...|$|R

50|$|If having {{sufficient}} bromelain content, raw {{pineapple juice}} {{may be useful}} as a <b>meat</b> marinade and <b>tenderizer.</b> Although pineapple enzymes can interfere with the preparation of some foods or manufactured products, such as gelatin-based desserts or gel capsules, their proteolytic activity responsible for such properties may be degraded during cooking and canning. The quantity of bromelain in a typical serving of pineapple fruit is probably not significant, but specific extraction can yield sufficient quantities for domestic and industrial processing.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the ways in}} which my artistic practice is creating a space for victims and survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault to share, gain catharsis, and spark discussions. As a survivor of domestic violence and sexual assault, I have often felt there was no space for me to voice the many emotions that come with my experience. After creating and sharing autobiographical work about my story, many women have shared their stories of survival with me. Through these many conversations, I knew that we needed to create a space to share these stories. I have created this space through the To(get) her project. To(get) her is a collaborative performance and installation in which women from a variety of backgrounds destroy and transform wax guns with kitchen and cosmetic tools such as waffle irons, hair dryers, high-heeled shoes, curling irons, and <b>meat</b> <b>tenderizers.</b> These wax guns act {{as a metaphor for the}} violence that happens to many women on a daily basis. One in three women will encounter domestic violence and one in five women will be raped in their lifetimes in the United States. Not only are many of our bodies attacked mentally, physically and sexually, but the government also stakes claims on our bodies. With 138 representatives and 22 senators voting against the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and many of those same politicians also voting against stricter gun regulations it is apparent that these politicians do not see it as problematic that women’s bodies are so often targets. Further, in the current political climate it is imperative that people in the United States understand the importance of VAWA, and that it is a necessary bill that will be up for reauthorization in 2018. There have been six iterations of the To(get) her project. Through these performances, over 75 self-identifying women have been a part of the project, sharing their stories and igniting discussion about violence against women. When women come together, their connections are empowering, fierce, sometimes gentle and always meaningful...|$|R
