25|$|The polite {{thing would}} be to say 'No comment'. But the truth is that... let's put it this way, you've never seen two actors more {{completely}} subservient and prostrate themselves {{at the feet of}} a director. Stanley was absolutely thrilled with the film. He was still working on the film when he died. And he probably died because he finally relaxed. It was one of the happiest weekends of his life, right before he died, after he had shown the first cut to Terry, Tom and Nicole. He would have kept working on it, like he did on all of his films. But I know that from people around him personally, <b>my</b> <b>partner</b> who was his assistant for thirty years. And I thought about R. Lee Ermey for In the Bedroom. And I talked to Stanley a lot about that film, and all I can say is Stanley was adamant that I shouldn't work with him for all kinds of reasons that I won't get into because {{there is no reason to}} do that to anyone, even if they are saying slanderous things that I know are completely untrue.|$|E

500|$|In his {{capacity}} of Praetorian prefect, Sejanus {{quickly became a}} trusted advisor to Tiberius. By AD 23, he exerted a considerable influence over {{the decisions of the}} emperor, who referred to Sejanus as [...] "Socius Laborum" [...] (<b>my</b> <b>partner</b> in my toils). By this time he had been raised to the rank of praetor, a position which was not normally granted to Romans of the equestrian class. A statue had been erected in his honor in the Theatre of Pompey, and in the Senate, his followers were advanced with public offices and governorships. However this privileged position caused resentment among the senatorial class and the imperial family, in particular earning him the enmity of Tiberius' son Drusus Julius Caesar.|$|E

500|$|During {{her final}} years, Dworkin {{suffered}} fragile health, and she revealed {{in her last}} column for the Guardian {{that she had been}} weakened and nearly crippled {{for the past several years}} by severe osteoarthritis in the knees. Shortly after returning from Paris in 1999, she had been hospitalized with a high fever and blood clots in her legs. A few months after being released from the hospital, she became increasingly unable to bend her knees, and underwent surgery to replace her knees with titanium and plastic prosthetics. She wrote, [...] "The doctor who knows me best says that osteoarthritis begins long before it cripples [...] in my case, possibly from homelessness, or sexual abuse, or beatings on my legs, or my weight. John, <b>my</b> <b>partner,</b> blames Scapegoat, a study of Jewish identity and women's liberation that took me nine years to write; it is, he says, the book that stole my health. I blame the drug-rape that I experienced in 1999 in Paris." ...|$|E

The release of the official music video followed on 17 May 2017 on the same platform, but was not made available to watch until 26 May 2017. It was directed by Manuel Escalante of Enjambre Producciones in different locations in Mexico City and Barcelona, with production and photography handled by him along with Petter Lettocha and José Casillas. When interviewed, Muñiz expained {{the concept of the}} visual, [...] " [...] We were very moved by {{the idea of having a}} story of a long-distance virtual and sentimental relationship that is carried out through virtual reality: one in Mexico and the other one in Barcelona. Everything begins [...] when I invariably connect with <b>my</b> <b>partner</b> (Alexandra Stan) through a virtual reality system in which we live a super romance and where we see each other in different locations in Mexico City and Barcelona." ...|$|E
500|$|Cyrus {{was raised}} as a Christian and {{identified}} herself as such during her childhood and early adult life. Some recent quotes such as [...] "You are all stardust. You couldn’t {{be here if}} stars hadn’t exploded... So forget Jesus. Stars died so you can live", and social media content have led to questions surrounding her religious beliefs. Cyrus includes references to Tibetan Buddhism in the lyrics of [...] "Milky Milky Milk" [...] (2015). Cyrus came out as pansexual to her mother when she was 14, and has said: [...] "I never want to label myself! I am ready to love anyone that loves me for who I am! I am open." [...] In June 2015, Time reported that she also identifies as gender fluid. She was quoted as stating she [...] " [...] relate to being boy or girl, and I don't have to have <b>my</b> <b>partner</b> relate to boy or girl." [...] Cyrus is {{a supporter of the}} LGBT community, and is often vocal about her beliefs on the topic. Her song [...] "My Heart Beats For Love" [...] (2010) was written for one of Cyrus' gay friends, while she has since claimed that London is her favorite place to perform due to its extensive gay scene. Cyrus also has an equals sign tattooed on her ring finger in support of same-sex marriage. She is the founder of the Happy Hippie Foundation, which works to [...] "fight injustice facing homeless youth, LGBTQ youth and other vulnerable populations". Cyrus is open about her recreational use of cannabis. She told Rolling Stone in 2013 that it was [...] "the best drug on earth" [...] and called it, along with MDMA, a [...] "happy drug". While accepting the Best Video award at the 2013 MTV Europe Music Awards, Cyrus smoked {{what appeared to be a}} joint on stage; this was removed from the delayed broadcast of the program in the United States. In a 2014 interview with W, Cyrus stated [...] "I love weed" [...] and [...] "I just love getting stoned." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following each scenario, {{people were}} {{presented}} with two options about how their attachments might respond. One option was [...] "he/she accepts you." [...] The other option was [...] "he/she rejects you." [...] People {{were asked to rate}} the likelihood of each response on a seven-point scale. Ratings of likely attachment responses corresponded to people's attachment styles. People with secure attachment styles were more likely to expect accepting responses from their attachments. Their relational schema for the third closeness scenario would be, [...] "If I tell <b>my</b> <b>partner</b> how deeply I feel for him or her, then <b>my</b> <b>partner</b> will accept me." [...] People with other attachment styles were less likely to expect accepting responses from their attachments. Their relational schema for the third closeness scenario would be, [...] "If I tell <b>my</b> <b>partner</b> how deeply I feel for him or her, then my attachment will reject me." [...] Differences in attachment styles reflected differences in relational schemas. Relational schemas may therefore be used to understand the organization of working models of attachment, as has been demonstrated in subsequent studies.|$|E
2500|$|For example, if {{a person}} {{regularly}} asks his or her partner for a hug or kiss, and the partner regularly responds with a hug or kiss, the person forms a relational schema representing the predictable interaction. The schema contains information about the self (e.g., [...] "I need lots of physical affection"). It also contains information about the partner (e.g., [...] "My partner is an affectionate person"). And it contains information {{about the way the}} interaction usually unfolds, which can be summarized by an if–then statement (e.g., [...] "If I ask <b>my</b> <b>partner</b> for a hug or kiss, then <b>my</b> <b>partner</b> will respond with a hug or kiss and comfort me"). Relational schemas help guide behavior in relationships by allowing people to anticipate and plan for partner responses.|$|E

2500|$|Relational transgressions {{are a part}} of any relationship. [...] In each instance, {{partners}} must {{weigh the}} severity of the transgression against how much they value the relationship. [...] In some cases, trust can be so severely damaged that repair strategies are fruitless. [...] With each transgression both transgressor and victim assume risks. [...] The transgressor’s efforts at reconciliation may be rejected by the victim, which results in loss of face and potentially an avenue of attack by the victim. [...] If the victim offers forgiveness, there is risk that the transgressor may view the forgiveness as a personality trait that may prompt future transgressions (e.g., “I’ll be forgiven by <b>my</b> <b>partner</b> just like every other time”).|$|E
2500|$|It {{was then}} that French {{producer}} Mirwais Ahmadzaï was introduced by Madonna's partner Guy Oseary. In an interview with CNN, she stated, [...] "Guy Oseary, <b>my</b> <b>partner</b> at Maverick , was given a demo by a French artist called Mirwais. [...] slipped {{it to me and}} said, 'What do you think [...] as an artist to sign at Maverick?' [...] I just said 'Oh my God, this is what I want.' I just flipped over it and said, 'Please find out if he wants to work with me.'" [...] Ahmadzaï spoke little English, and Madonna commented: [...] "The first couple of days we were recording, I wanted to rip my hair out. [...] It didn't seem like there was any way for us to communicate. His manager had to come in and translate everything at first." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Richard Matheson and Carol Serling {{produced}} an outline for a two-hour made-for-TV movie which would feature Matheson adaptations of three yet-unfilmed Rod Serling short stories. Outlines {{for such a}} production were rejected by CBS until early 1994, when Serling's widow discovered a complete shooting script ("Where the Dead Are") authored by her late husband, while rummaging through their garage. Serling showed the forgotten script to producers Michael O'Hara and Laurence Horowitz, who were significantly impressed by it. [...] "I had a pile of scripts, which I usually procrastinate about reading. But I read this one right away and, after 30 pages, called <b>my</b> <b>partner</b> and said, [...] "I love it," [...] recalled O'Hara.

2500|$|Capitalizing on {{the success}} of the 1950s big-money quiz The $64,000 Question on CBS, Barry and Enright {{developed}} their flagship show, Twenty One, a quiz which had a scoring system based loosely on Blackjack. Contestants were placed in twin isolation booths and asked questions ranging in value from one to 11 points — the higher the point value, the more difficult the question. Enright described the initial broadcast of Twenty One as [...] "a dismal failure. It was just plain dull." [...] Contestants repeatedly missed questions and, in Enright's own words, [...] "It lacked all drama; it lacked all suspense. The next morning the sponsor (Geritol) called <b>my</b> <b>partner,</b> Jack Barry, and me and told us in no uncertain terms that he never wanted to see a repeat of what happened the previous night. And from that moment on, we decided to rig Twenty One." [...] Even with rigging, initial ratings were unimpressive.|$|E
