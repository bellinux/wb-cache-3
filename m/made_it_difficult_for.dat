5|$|In December 2012, {{official}} servers for Thrones and Patriots {{were shut}} down by GameSpy Technologies, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> multiplayer matches to be played officially online.

5|$|Since 1948, {{successive}} {{governments have}} adopted policies {{that had the}} net effect of assisting the Sinhalese community in such areas as education and public employment. These policies <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> middle class Tamil youth to enter university or secure employment.|$|E

5|$|Al-Maʿarri was an ascetic, renouncing worldly {{desires and}} living secluded from others while {{producing}} his works. He opposed {{all forms of}} violence. In Baghdad, while being well received, {{he decided not to}} sell his texts, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> him to live. This ascetic lifestyle has been compared to similar thought in India during his time.|$|E
5|$|Belgrano also {{experienced}} paludism (malaria) {{during the second}} campaign to Upper Peru. On 3 May 1815 he informed the government of his disease, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> him to work or even talk. He was treated by doctor Joseph Readhead, who employed a local species of the Cinchona medicinal plant. The disease lasted up to his stay in Britain, when his health improved because of the treatment and by having left the endemic zone.|$|E
5|$|Building traditions {{varied by}} region {{and type of}} structure. Food storage houses - stabbur - were usually built on stilts in ways that <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> mice and rats, but not cats, to get in. Exterior {{cladding}} varied by region, often {{to take into account}} local climate conditions. Roofs were often covered with birch bark and sod.|$|E

5|$|During this time, the {{authorities}} imposed a ban preventing Rajab {{from engaging in}} any new business in Bahrain that <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> him to earn a living. The ban was subsequently lifted without any official explanation. In mid-August 2010, a number of opposition activists were again arrested. According to Rajab, an order for his arrest was issued on 8 September but was cancelled on 18 October. Rajab was also subject to a travel ban during this period.|$|E
5|$|Sheridan {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} with Bulgarian club CSKA Sofia on 13 August 2010. Sheridan made his debut in the 2–2 draw against League of Wales side The New Saints; CSKA won 5–2 on aggregate. He scored his first goal for the club in their 3–1 away win against Sliven. On 25 September, Sheridan scored twice in a 2–0 win against Montana. Changes of management, however, <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> Sheridan to settle in Bulgaria.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 U.S. Open Cup Final {{was played}} on September 2 at RFK Stadium in Washington D.C. A total of 17,329 fans {{attended}} the match, 38% of the stadium's available capacity. Approximately 200 Sounders FC fans sat {{together in the}} upper deck. Both the travel distance and the mid-week scheduling <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> Seattle fans to attend. Live television coverage was provided nationally by Fox Soccer Channel.|$|E

5|$|The French {{invasion}} of Russia, where poor traction conditions for ill-shod horses <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> supply wagons {{to keep up}} with troops. That campaign was also strongly affected by cold, whereby the retreating army reached Neman River in December 1812 with only 10,000 of the 420,000 that had set out to invade Russia in June of the same year.|$|E
5|$|The Sumatran rhino {{is widely}} {{scattered}} across its range, {{much more so}} than the other Asian rhinos, which has <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> conservationists to protect members of the species effectively. Only five areas are known to contain Sumatran rhinoceros: Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Gunung Leuser National Park, and Way Kambas National Park on Sumatra; Danum Valley in Sabah, Malaysia, on the island of Borneo, and on Indonesian Borneo west of Samarindah.|$|E
5|$|A {{report by}} Rundstedt to Hitler in October 1943 {{regarding}} the weak defences in France {{led to the}} appointment of Rommel to oversee the construction of further fortifications along the expected invasion-front, which stretched from the Netherlands to Cherbourg. Rommel was given command of the newly re-formed Army Group B, which included the 7th Army, the 15th Army, and the forces guarding the Netherlands. Nazi Germany's tangled command structure <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> Rommel to achieve his task. He {{was not allowed to}} give orders to the Organisation Todt, which was commanded by armaments minister Albert Speer, so in some places he had to assign soldiers to do construction work.|$|E

5|$|Alboin's {{problems}} in maintaining {{control over his}} people worsened during the siege of Ticinum. The nature of the Lombard monarchy <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> a ruler to exert {{the same degree of}} authority over his subjects as had been exercised by Theodoric over his Goths, and the structure of the army gave great authority to the military commanders or duces, who led each band (fara) of warriors. Additionally, the difficulties encountered by Alboin in building a solid political entity resulted from a lack of imperial legitimacy, as unlike the Ostrogoths, they had not entered Italy as foederati but as enemies of the Empire.|$|E
5|$|Although Chaplin {{still had}} plans for future film projects, by the mid-1970s {{he was very}} frail. He {{experienced}} several further strokes, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> him to communicate, {{and he had to}} use a wheelchair. His final projects were compiling a pictorial autobiography, My Life in Pictures (1974) and scoring A Woman of Paris for re-release in 1976. He also appeared in a documentary about his life, The Gentleman Tramp (1975), directed by Richard Patterson. In the 1975 New Year Honours, Chaplin was awarded a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II, though he was too weak to kneel and received the honour in his wheelchair.|$|E
5|$|Another {{major concern}} of the Shelby {{administration}} was free navigation on the Mississippi River, which was vital to the state's economic interests. For political reasons the Spanish had closed the port at New Orleans to the Americans. This {{would have been the}} natural market for the tobacco, flour and hemp grown by Kentucky farmers; overland routes were too expensive to be profitable. This <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> land speculators to entice immigration to the area to turn a profit on their investments. Many Kentuckians felt the federal government was not acting decisively or quickly enough to remedy this situation.|$|E

5|$|By 1907, Londoners {{had seen}} the network of deep tube {{underground}} railways expand from the original C line of 1890 with its six stations to a network of seven lines serving more than 70 stations. These companies, along with the sub-surface Metropolitan Railway and District Railway, criss-crossed beneath the city streets, competing with one another for passengers {{as well as with}} the new electric trams and motor buses. In several cases pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers had proven to be over optimistic. The reduced revenues generated from the lower numbers of passengers using the lines <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> the operators to pay back the capital borrowed and pay dividends to shareholders.|$|E
5|$|Despite Oklahoma's role in instigating the {{construction}} of the Kansas Turnpike, its plans for a connecting turnpike fell through. The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority (OTA) had not performed a traffic study, as KTA had, to prove that the proposed Oklahoma turnpike would be profitable. Oklahoma also suffered from a poorer credit rating than did Kansas. Additionally, by this time many states' turnpike authorities were competing in the bond markets for investor dollars. All of these issues combined <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> OTA to issue bonds for its toll road. When funding had been obtained, political issues stalled the proposed toll road further.|$|E
5|$|Gertrude was {{released}} from police custody shortly after the incident. She was sent to Chicago with $7 and was never heard from again. The hydrochloric acid that Carlton ingested failed to kill him, but did badly burn his esophagus, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> him to ingest food. Carlton was indicted on August 16 and was charged {{with the murder of}} Mamah Borthwick, the only death that was directly witnessed by a survivor. Carlton entered a not guilty plea. Forty-seven days after the fire, before the case could be heard, Carlton died of starvation in his cell.|$|E
