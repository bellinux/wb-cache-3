5|$|The variable-quality cement {{which had}} been used in the {{construction}} of the Causeway bridges meant that by the early 2000s, they had suffered significant damage, leading to a repair contract being awarded to Kulin Group in 2004. Localised patching of cracks in the piers was undertaken. At the ends of the piers, the cracking was more substantial and had to be tied back with carbon fibre reinforcement. Repairs were then coated with <b>moisture-resistant</b> coating, and were expected to lengthen the life of the bridges by decades.|$|E
25|$|Other {{types of}} plywoods include fire-retardant, <b>moisture-resistant,</b> wire mesh, sign-grade, and pressure-treated. However, the plywood may {{be treated with}} various {{chemicals}} to improve the plywood's fireproofing. Each of these products is designed to fill a need in industry.|$|E
25|$|Six {{hours before}} his rescue, each miner {{switched}} to liquid diet rich in sugars, minerals, and potassium. Each took an aspirin to help avert blood clots, {{and wore a}} girdle to stabilize blood pressure, <b>moisture-resistant</b> coveralls and sunglasses against the sudden exposure to sunlight. The capsule included oxygen masks, heart monitors, and video cameras.|$|E
25|$|In 1928, DuGas (later {{bought by}} ANSUL) {{came out with}} a cartridge-operated dry {{chemical}} extinguisher, which used sodium bicarbonate specially treated with chemicals to render it free-flowing and <b>moisture-resistant.</b> It consisted of a copper cylinder with an internal CO2cartridge. The operator turned a wheel valve on top to puncture the cartridge and squeezed a lever on the valve {{at the end of the}} hose to discharge the chemical. This was the first agent available for large-scale three-dimensional liquid and pressurized gas fires, and was but remained largely a specialty type until the 1950s, when small dry chemical units were marketed for home use. ABC dry chemical came over from Europe in the 1950s, with Super-K being invented in the early 60s and Purple-K being developed by the US Navy in the late 1960s. Manually applied dry agents such as graphite for class D (metal) fires had existed since WWII, but it wasn't until 1949 that Ansul introduced a pressurized extinguisher using an external CO2 cartridge to discharge the agent. Met-L-X (sodium chloride) was the first extinguisher developed in the US, with graphite, copper, and several other types being developed later.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally the Standard Poodle, {{the largest}} of the breed, was a {{retriever}} or gun dog, used in particular for duck hunting and sometimes upland bird hunting. [...] The breed has been used for fowl hunting in US and Canada since the early 1990s, in and out of hunting tests. [...] The modern Standard retains many of the traits prized by their original owners: a keen working intelligence that makes the dog easy to command, webbed feet that make it an agile swimmer (all of the poodle's ancestors and descendants had or share the love of water) athletic stamina, and a <b>moisture-resistant,</b> curly coat that acts like a wool jumper in damp conditions. Towards {{the second half of the}} nineteenth century their use in hunting declined in favour of their use in circuses and status symbols of the wealthy, so that by the 20th century they were only found as companions or circus ...|$|E
50|$|Because it is {{impermeable}} and <b>moisture-resistant,</b> cork {{is often}} used {{as an alternative to}} leather in handbags, wallets and other fashion items.|$|E

The mats turned on or off any time adjusting to the current weather conditions.|$|E
50|$|Traditional timber {{formwork}}. The formwork {{is built}} on site out of timber and plywood or <b>moisture-resistant</b> particleboard. It is easy to produce but time-consuming for larger structures, and the plywood facing has a relatively short lifespan. It is still used extensively where the labour costs are lower than the costs for procuring reusable formwork. It {{is also the most}} flexible type of formwork, so even where other systems are in use, complicated sections may use it.|$|E
5000|$|In 1925, Krannert {{started his}} own {{business}} in Indianapolis, the Inland Container Corporation, with six employees, {{all of whom had}} also quit the company in Anderson. The company expanded and survived the Great Depression. During World War II, the United States government began buying large quantities of Inland's <b>moisture-resistant</b> [...] "V-Board" [...] boxes. By the early 1970s, Inland Container was America's second-largest manufacturer of corrugated shipping containers, with a complex of 25 plants grossing $200 million in annual sales.|$|E

50|$|Vectran's golden fibers {{are noted}} for their thermal {{stability}} at high temperatures, high strength and modulus, low creep, and good chemical stability. They are <b>moisture-resistant</b> and generally stable in hostile environments. Polyester coating {{is often used}} around a Vectran core; polyurethane coating can improve abrasion resistance and act as a water barrier. Vectran has a melting point of 330 °C, with progressive strength loss from 220 °C. As it has low resistance to ultraviolet radiation, {{it should not be}} used long-term in outdoor environments.|$|E
50|$|Farmers {{who need}} to make large amounts of hay are likely to choose balers which produce much larger bales, maximizing the amount of hay which is {{protected}} from the elements. Large bales come in two types, round and square. Large square bales, which can weigh up to 1000 kg, can be stacked and are easier to transport on trucks. Large round bales, which typically weigh 300 to(-) 400 kg, are more <b>moisture-resistant,</b> and pack the hay more densely (especially at the center). Round bales are quickly fed {{with the use of}} mechanized equipment.|$|E

The capsule included oxygen masks, heart monitors, and video cameras.After a miner was strapped into the 21 in wide capsule, it ascended about 1 m/s, taking 9 to 18 minutes to reach the surface. Piñera was present for each arrival during the 24-hour rescue.|$|E
5000|$|The brown butcher paper {{accessory}} pack contained sugar tablets, halazone {{water purification}} tablets (for {{a brief period}} in 1945), a flat wooden spoon, a piece of candy-coated chewing gum, 3 [...] "short" [...] sample 3-packs or one [...] "long" [...] sample 9-pack of commercial-grade cigarettes and a book of 20 cardboard <b>moisture-resistant</b> matches, a paper-wrapped P-38 can opener printed with instructions for its proper use, and typically 22.5 sheets of toilet paper (compared to 3 sheets for the British Army). [...] The P-38 can openers were generally worn on the GI's [...] "dog tag" [...] chain to facilitate opening the next meal's cans.|$|E
5000|$|Molded {{expanded}} polystyrene, {{also known}} as MEPS, EPS, or beadboard, consists of many tiny foam beads molded and pressed together. EPS is manufactured in low-density and high-density versions. Low-density EPS is relatively inexpensive, resistant {{to the effects of}} moisture, and can be used underground. High-density EPS is even more <b>moisture-resistant,</b> and is manufactured for use on exterior foundation walls and burial against footings, if the soil is relatively dry. EPS typically uses pentane as a blowing agent, avoiding the high global warming potential of CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs, as well as the ozone depletion potential of CFC and HCFCs.|$|E
50|$|A rainscreen is an {{exterior}} wall detail where the siding (wall cladding) stands {{off from the}} <b>moisture-resistant</b> surface of an air barrier applied to the sheathing (sheeting) to create a capillary break and to allow drainage and evaporation. The rain screen is the siding itself but the term rainscreen implies a system of building. Ideally the rain screen prevents the wall air/moisture barrier on sheathing from getting wet. In some cases a rainscreen wall is called a pressure-equalized rainscreen wall where the ventilation openings are large enough for the air pressure to nearly equalize {{on both sides of}} the rain screen, but this name has been criticized as being redundant and is only useful to scientists and engineers.|$|E
50|$|The 1996 {{helmet and}} jersey design with the 1998 gold pants was worn as the team's regular uniforms {{until the end}} of the 2008 season. The 49ers once again changed uniforms in 2009, which are very similar to the classic design, albeit with several {{significant}} changes. The sleeve stripes are now set at an angle to accommodate the even shorter sleeves of modern jerseys, (though the stripes appear straight and parallel to the ground when worn by the players themselves). An updated 49ers uniform with improved fit, and more breathable and <b>moisture-resistant</b> fabrics was debuted (alongside the rest of the NFL teams) by new league uniform manufacturer Nike on April 3, 2012.|$|E
50|$|In 1912, {{the first}} patents for PVC were founded in Britain and Germany. It {{was not until}} the early 1930s that PVC was able to be {{produced}} cheaply, limiting its marketable applications for the time. World War II helped make the substance popular, as manufacturers used it to make an assortment of items for soldiers. It was here that PVC’s water resistance was shown to be an important property, and tools made from PVC were used in many marine applications. After the war, PVC was not a popular choice of materials in the marine industry due to its density. In the 1970s, the need for a strong, <b>moisture-resistant</b> material led to plastic manufactures working with PVC to make it lighter. This {{led to the creation of}} PVC foamboard, by combining PVC with polyurea at the molecular level.|$|E
