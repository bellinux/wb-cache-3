At {{the heart of the}} ISIS accelerator is a proton synchrotron which uses a ring of magnets connected in series and configured as a White Circuit [1]. The magnets are connected in series with capacitor banks so that they form a resonant circuit with a fundamental frequency of 50 Hz. The circuit allows the magnets to be fed with an AC current superimposed on a DC current. The AC is currently provided by a 1 MVA Motor-Alternator set and it is now proposed to replace this by a solid state UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) system.

40|$|Water <b>mains</b> <b>failure</b> {{studies have}} focused on failure {{clustering}} analysis which measures the spatial clustering of failures and failure factor analysis which quantifies the impact of various factors on failure occurrences. This study aims to enhance these two analyses by using a spatial analysis approach. The improvements include (1) initial global and multi-scale geographical statistics to measure the failure clustering, (2) refining quantitative relationships between failure factors and failure occurrences and (3) filling the research gap in subtropical regions by a Hong Kong case study. The global and multi-scale failure cluster measures are based on Moran's I and Ripley's K-statistic. Failure factors are analysed using descriptive statistics and regressions. Failures rates per unit pipe length were found highly clustered in space. The scale at which the failures are the most clustered was also identified. The failure factor analysis revealed quantitative relationships that were more detailed than previous studies, or specific for Hong Kong, between failure rate and four factors: pipe diameter, pipe age, material and temperature. The global failure cluster measure verifies the necessity for cluster analysis in identifying areas of high failure risk. The multi-scale measure suggests that it should be effective and economic to monitor areas of high failure risk if the area size is 1 - 1. 5 km in radius. The refined failure factor analysis can enhance the accuracy of failure risk prediction models and results in several failure control recommendations for Hong Kong and other subtropical cities.

40|$|Cast Iron {{water mains}} used in potable water {{transportation}} systems {{are facing a}} rapidly growing rate of failure. The most common failure mode of cast iron water main is circumferential cracking that occurs due to high longitudinal stresses in the pipe wall, when the longitudinal stress exceeds {{the strength of the}} pipe material. However, the circumferential failure mechanism of the pipe is not well understood. Conventional methods of pipe analysis predict higher circumferential stresses, which would cause longitudinal cracking in the pipe. The higher longitudinal stress is attributed to a number of factors such as corrosion pits on pipe wall, lack of bedding support due to erosion of bedding soil, and localized concentrated supports (or forces) due to lumps of soil or rock pieces. The failure mechanisms of buried cast iron water mains subjected to three factors such as non-uniform bedding support, pitting corrosion and localized concentrated supports are investigated in this thesis. A detailed numerical investigation is carried out based on three-dimensional finite element analyses using ANSYS software. The non-uniform bedding is found to create high longitudinal stresses for larger void at the pipe invert. Although pitting corrosion alone results in high circumferential stresses, when it occurs simultaneously with a non-uniform bedding condition, the peak stresses result in the longitudinal direction. Longitudinal stress is generally higher than the circumferential stress for the pipes with higher relative stiffness with respect to soil. The presence of localized supports is found to be a critical factor, which leads the stresses to exceed the strength of the cast iron material. This study contributes {{to the development of a}} better understanding of the mechanism of cast iron water <b>mains</b> <b>failure...</b>|$|R
