5|$|Although {{many species}} of Psittacosaurus have been named, their {{relationships}} to each other {{have not yet been}} fully explored and no scientific consensus exists on the subject. Several phylogenetic analyses have been published, with the <b>most</b> <b>detailed</b> being those by Alexander Averianov and colleagues in 2006, Hai-Lu You and colleagues in 2008, and Paul Sereno in 2010. The middle one is shown below.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{traditional}} history of the Fairy Flag is preserved in manuscript form. In {{the early part of}} the 20th century, Fred T. MacLeod noted one manuscript written around 1800, which he considered to be the <b>most</b> <b>detailed</b> description of the flag. Another source of the flag's traditional history is the Bannatyne manuscript, which documents {{the traditional}} history of Clan MacLeod. It dates to the 1830s, however, it is thought to have been based upon earlier traditions.|$|E
5|$|One of the <b>most</b> <b>detailed</b> {{reports of}} {{military}} activity under the Flavian dynasty {{was written by}} Tacitus, whose biography of his father-in-law Gnaeus Julius Agricola largely concerns the conquest of Britain between 77 and 84. Agricola arrived c. 77 as governor of Roman Britain, immediately launching campaigns into Caledonia (modern Scotland).|$|E

50|$|Despite several {{contemporary}} {{sources of}} the background and lead-up to the battle, the narrative source which gives the <b>most</b> <b>detail</b> of the battle itself is the Gesta Wiscardi of William of Apulia.|$|R
5|$|The Annals by Tacitus {{is one of}} the <b>most</b> <b>detailed</b> {{accounts}} of Germanicus' campaigns against the Germans. He wrote his account {{in the early years of}} the second century. Tacitus described Germanicus as a fine general who was kind and temperate, saying that his early death had taken a great ruler from Rome.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Svolder, {{the victorious}} leaders split Norway into areas of control. Heimskringla gives the <b>most</b> <b>detailed</b> {{account of the}} division, {{describing}} it as threefold. Olaf the Swede received four districts in Trondheim as well as Møre, Romsdal and Rånrike. He gave these to Jarl Svein Hákonarson, his son in law, to hold as a vassal. Svein Forkbeard gained possession of the Viken district, where Danish influence had long been strong. The rest of Norway was ruled by Eirik Hákonarson as Svein's vassal. Fagrskinna, in contrast, says that the Swedish part consisted of Oppland {{and a part of}} Trondheim. Other sources are less specific.|$|E
5|$|Byzantine {{authors were}} the first to record these events. The {{earliest}} work is Emperor Leo the Wise's Tactics, finished around 904, which recounts the Bulgarian-Byzantine war of 894–896, a military conflict directly preceding the Hungarians' departure from the Pontic steppes. Nearly contemporary narration can be read in the Continuation of the Chronicle by George the Monk. However, De Administrando Imperio ("On Governing the Empire") provides the <b>most</b> <b>detailed</b> account. It was compiled under the auspices of Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus in 951 or 952.|$|E

5|$|Labillardière {{eventually}} {{published the}} genus Adenanthos, along with A.cuneatus {{and two other}} species, in his 1805 Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen. He chose the specific name cuneata {{in reference to the}} leaves of this species, which are cuneate (triangular). This name has feminine gender, consistent with the gender assigned by Labillardière to the genus. He did not designate which of the three published species was to serve as the type species of Adenanthos, but Irish botanist E. Charles Nelson has since chosen A.cuneatus as lectotype for the genus, since the holotype of A.cuneatus bears an annotation showing the derivation of the genus name, and because Labillardière's description of it is the <b>most</b> <b>detailed</b> of the three, and is referred to by the other descriptions.|$|E
5|$|Most {{information}} about Magnus is gleaned from Norse sagas and chronicles, which began appearing during the 12th century. The most important sources still available are the Norwegian chronicles Historia de Antiquitate Regum Norwagiensium by Theodoric the Monk and the anonymous Ágrip af Noregskonungasögum (or simply Ágrip) from the 1180s and the Icelandic sagas Heimskringla (by Snorri Sturluson), Morkinskinna and Fagrskinna, which date {{to about the}} 1220s. While the later sagas are the <b>most</b> <b>detailed</b> accounts, they are also generally considered the least reliable. Additional {{information about}} Magnus, in particular his campaigns, is found in sources from the British Isles, which included contemporary accounts.|$|E
5|$|Quantification of the {{proportion}} of barbarian-born troops in the 4th-century army is highly speculative. Elton has undertaken the <b>most</b> <b>detailed</b> analysis of the meagre evidence. According to this analysis, {{about a quarter of}} the sample of army officers was barbarian-born in the period 350–400. Analysis by decade shows that this proportion did not increase over the period, or indeed in the early 5th century. The latter trend implies that {{the proportion}} of barbarians in the lower ranks was not much greater, otherwise {{the proportion of}} barbarian officers would have increased over time to reflect that.|$|E
50|$|There {{were few}} {{contemporary}} sources for {{details of the}} battle, and some, {{such as that of}} Adam of Usk, contained inaccuracies. <b>Most</b> <b>details</b> must therefore be assumptions, although the ground remains largely unchanged and provides a reasonable basis for them.|$|R
50|$|Michael (Mihály; after 960-995 or c. 997) was {{a member}} of the House of Árpád, a younger son of Taksony, Grand Prince of the Hungarians. <b>Most</b> <b>details</b> of his life are uncertain. Almost all kings of Hungary after 1046 descended from him.|$|R
5000|$|Tolstoy omits <b>most</b> <b>details</b> {{which in}} the 20th century would be {{considered}} too gruesome or too moralistic, such as: Pinocchio having burned his feet; black rabbits pretending to be about to bury him; {{the whole story of}} the Toyland; the shark swallowing Pinocchio and his father etc.|$|R
5|$|Several {{volcanic}} {{features in}} the Mount Cayley field were illustrated by volcanologist Jack Souther in 1980, including Mount Cayley, Cauldron Dome, Slag Hill, Mount Fee, Ember Ridge and Ring Mountain, which was titled Crucible Dome at the time. This resulted {{in the creation of}} a geologic map that showed the regional terrain and locations of the volcanoes. The <b>most</b> <b>detailed</b> study of Mount Cayley took place during this period. Little Ring Mountain at the northernmost end of the field had not been studied at the time and was not included on Souther's 1980 map. Ember Ridge at the southern end of the field was originally mapped as a cluster of five lava domes. The sixth lava dome, Ember Ridge Northeast, was discovered by Ph.D. student Melanie Kelman during a period of research in 2001.|$|E
5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>detailed</b> {{account of}} this period is handed down to us by Tacitus, whose Annals {{dedicate}} the first six books entirely to the reign of Tiberius. Tacitus was a Roman senator, born {{during the reign of}} Nero in 56 AD, and consul suffect in AD 97. His text is largely based on the Acta Senatus (the minutes of the session of the Senate) and the Acta Diurna (a collection of the acts of the government and news of the court and capital), as well as speeches by Tiberius himself, and the histories of contemporaries such as Marcus Cluvius Rufus, Fabius Rusticus and Pliny the Elder (all of which are lost).|$|E
5|$|The woman's {{hands are}} crossed tightly {{as if in}} prayer, and {{positioned}} so low in the painting as {{to appear to be}} resting on the frame. They are rendered as tightly compressed into a small area of the picture; it is likely van der Weyden did not want them to result in an area of high tone that might distract from the description of her head. Her slender fingers are minutely detailed; van der Weyden often indicated the social position of his models through his rendering of their face and hands. The sleeve of her dress extends beyond her wrists. Her fingers are folded in layers; their intricate portrayal is the <b>most</b> <b>detailed</b> element in the painting, and echoes the pyramidal form of the upper portion of the painting.|$|E
5000|$|Oligochaete worms {{without any}} mouth, gut, or nephridial {{excretory}} system were first {{discovered in the}} 1970s-1980s near Bermuda. They were later found to contain symbiotic chemosynthetic bacteria which serve as their primary food source. O. algarvensis is the species where this symbiosis has been studied in the <b>most</b> <b>detail.</b>|$|R

5|$|After the {{partition}} Rejtan withdrew from political life. He never married. He {{spent the rest}} of his days in a small estate at Hruszówka, where he died on August 8, 1780. His mental health had deteriorated; according to some due to distress with the loss of a part of his homeland, but rumours about his erratic behavior date to soon after the Partition Sejm begun in 1773, before its final motions were passed in 1776. He {{is said to have been}} escorted by his brothers from Warsaw on 19 March 1775 after he had a fit, and was locked in a small family's mansion which he would never leave up till his death. Eventually he committed suicide, cutting himself with glass (<b>most</b> <b>detailed</b> accounts say he swallowed it, to prevent being taken by pursuing Russian soldiers). His exact place of burial is unknown, and exhumation in Hruszówka in 1930 failed to conclusively find his grave.|$|E
5|$|By far the <b>most</b> <b>detailed</b> and {{reliable}} {{source for the}} battle, and Julian's Gallic campaign (355–60) generally, is the Res Gestae (Histories) of Ammianus Marcellinus, a contemporary historian. Ammianus was a Greek career soldier who joined the army before 350 and served until at least 363. Enlisted as a protector (cadet senior officer), {{he served as a}} staff officer under magister equitum Ursicinus and then under Julian himself in the latter's Persian campaign. Although he was not present at Strasbourg, he had experience of the Gallic front as he was involved in the suppression of the revolt of Claudius Silvanus, the magister equitum (commander-in-chief) in Gaul (355). However, his narrative reveals a passionate admiration of Julian and occasionally descends to the level of eulogy. Furthermore, as he was writing some 40 years after the event, it is likely that Ammianus relied heavily, if not exclusively, on Julian's own memoir of the Strasbourg campaign (which we know he published, but has been lost). Thus Ammianus' account probably reflects Julian's own propaganda. In addition, Ammianus' account is of uneven quality, with many gaps and some contradictory elements.|$|E
5|$|Dana's {{work was}} {{followed}} up by geologist C. E. Dutton's 1884 expedition, who refined and expanded Dana's ideas. Most notably, Dutton {{established that the}} island of Hawaii actually harbored five volcanoes, whereas Dana counted three. This is because Dana had originally regarded Kīlauea as a flank vent of Mauna Loa, and Kohala as part of Mauna Kea. Dutton also refined others of Dana's observations, and is credited with the naming of 'a'ā and pāhoehoe-type lavas, although Dana had noted a distinction. Stimulated by Dutton's expedition, Dana returned in 1887, and published many accounts of his expedition in the American Journal of Science. In 1890 he published the <b>most</b> <b>detailed</b> manuscript of its day, and remained the definitive guide to Hawaiian volcanism for decades. 1909 saw the publication of two large volumes which extensively quoted from earlier works now out of circulation.|$|E
