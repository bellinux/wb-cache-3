5|$|Both of Mario Andretti's sons, <b>Michael</b> <b>and</b> Jeff, were auto racers. Michael {{followed}} in his father's footsteps {{by winning the}} IndyCar title, with Mario's nephew John Andretti joining the series in 1988. This meant that the Andrettis became the first family to have four relatives compete in the same series. With Mario sharing driving duties with sons <b>Michael</b> <b>and</b> Jeff at the 1991 Rolex 24 at Daytona, driving a Porsche 962, the Andretti clan finished 5th. Mario's grandson Marco completed his first full season in the Indy Racing League (IRL) in 2006, driving for his father Michael's Andretti Green Racing team. Marco {{finished second in the}} 2006 Indianapolis 500 and so became the first third-generation recipient of the race's Rookie of the Year Award.|$|E

5|$|For Halloween II, Zombie {{decided to}} focus more on the {{connection}} between Laurie and <b>Michael,</b> <b>and</b> the idea they share similar psychological problems. Zombie wanted the sequel to be more realistic and violent than its 2007 predecessor. For the characters of Halloween II, it is about change. Zombie wanted to look at how the events of the first film affected the characters. Zombie also wanted to show the connection between Laurie and <b>Michael,</b> <b>and</b> provide a glimpse into each character's psyche. Filming primarily took place in Georgia, which provided Zombie with a tax incentive as well as the visual look the director was going for with the film. When it came time to provide a musical score, Zombie had trouble finding a place to include John Carpenter's original Halloween theme music. Although Carpenter's theme was used throughout Zombie's remake, the theme was only included in the final shot of this film.|$|E
