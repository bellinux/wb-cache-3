50|$|After the war, on {{his return}} to Jos, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{properties}} had either been vandalised or commandeered by the Nigerian army, others had been occupied by locals who laid claims to them. Among these was his private residence in Anglo Jos a part of which was turned into the Nigerian Air force office at the junction of Bukuru road/Miango road. His attempts to regain possession <b>of</b> <b>his</b> properties from the Nigerian government dragged on for decades. This was a huge financial blow from which chief J.K. (as he was referred to) never really recovered. He had spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> early <b>adult</b> life working and investing heavily in Jos and he must have assumed that after the war, it would be business as usual.|$|R
25|$|For <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>adult</b> life Russell {{maintained}} {{that religion is}} little more than superstition and, despite any positive effects that religion might have, it is largely harmful to people.

25|$|For <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>adult</b> life, Senator Calvin Ruck lobbied {{to get the}} Canadian {{government}} to award a medal posthumously to Jerry Jones.

Senator Ruck died in 2004, without achieving success.|$|E

His friends there {{included}} the poets Licinius Calvus, and Helvius Cinna, Quintus Hortensius (son of the orator and rival of Cicero) and the biographer Cornelius Nepos, to whom Catullus dedicated a libellus of poems, the relation of which to the extant collection remains a matter of debate. He {{appears to have}} been acquainted with the poet Marcus Furius Bibaculus. A number of prominent contemporaries appear in his poetry, including Cicero, Caesar and Pompey. According to an anecdote preserved by Suetonius, Caesar did not deny that Catullus's lampoons left an indelible stain on his reputation, but when Catullus apologized, he invited the poet for dinner the very same day.|$|R

[...] In the 1960s, he checked himself into Synanon, a drug rehabilitation facility in Los Angeles, and successfully ended his heroin use. After leaving Synanon, he made a small comeback, appearing in small roles in feature films and episodes of television shows such as Sanford and Son and The Jeffersons as a guest star (including two episodes of Maude as a resident of an apartment complex where the title character's husband temporarily lived) and Good Times where he had a recurring role (1974-1977) as [...] "Monty".

25|$|Henry James (1843–1916) {{confronted the}} Old World-New World dilemma by writing {{directly}} about it. Although {{he was born}} in New York City, James spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>adult</b> life in England. Many of his novels center on Americans who live in or travel to Europe. With its intricate, highly qualified sentences and dissection of emotional and psychological nuance, James's fiction can be daunting. Among his more accessible works are the novellas Daisy Miller, about an American girl in Europe, and The Turn of the Screw, a ghost story.|$|E
25|$|During the 1930s {{the couple}} moved {{frequently}} between New York City's Greenwich Village and California, as Patchen {{struggled to make}} a living as a writer.

The couple moved to a cottage in Old Lyme, Connecticut, in 1947.

5000|$|Several of {{the five}} brothers' first cousins, {{including}} the sons of Sam's youngest sibling Barney Schwartz and the sons one of Lena's cousins, also joined the operation. However, some of them chose to adopt different surnames in the workplace, including the surnames [...] "Harvey" [...] and [...] "Lawrence", {{so that it would}} not be immediately obvious that <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the people working in the upper levels of the company had the last name Schwartz, and thus were related. Avoiding public anti-Semitism was also a contributing factor to the cousins' surname changes; indeed, even some {{of the five}} brothers' first names were different than those on their birth certificates and early census records, changed to sound less overtly Jewish. For example, Arnold's real first name was Abraham, and the brother whose birth certificate showed [...] "Benny" [...] Schwartz officially went by the more genteel [...] "B. Davis" [...] Schwartz for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> later <b>adult</b> life.|$|R
50|$|Peter Percival {{was sent}} to Jaffna {{peninsula}} in Sri Lanka by the Wesleyan Methodist Mission of North Ceylon in 1826.

He spent <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> early <b>adult</b> life in Jaffna peninsula until 1851, with a short stint in Bengal (1829-32). While in Bengal he {{was influenced by the}} educational policies of Alexander Duff, a Presbyterian missionary.

He founded Vembadi Girls' High School and Hartley College. Apart from these popular schools, he also opened number of village schools for primary education. In 1836 his efforts led to the building of St. Paul's chapel in Jaffna.|$|R

During the period these books were written, as well as <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>adult</b> life, Bork was an agnostic, a fact used pejoratively behind the scenes by Southern Democrats when speaking to their evangelical constituents during his Supreme Court nomination process.|$|E
25|$|The {{acquisition}} of human immunity against snake venom is ancient (from ca. 60 CE, Psylli Tribe). Research into development of vaccines {{that will lead}} to immunity is ongoing. Bill Haast, owner and director of the Miami Serpentarium, injected himself with snake venom during <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>adult</b> life, in an effort to build up an immunity to a broad array of venomous snakes. It is a practice known as mithridatism. Haast lived to age 100, and survived a reported 172 snake bites. He donated his blood to be used in treating snake-bite victims when a suitable anti-venom was not available. More than twenty so-treated individuals recovered.|$|E

5000|$|The Cay, Taylor's {{story of}} a racially prejudiced white boy {{stranded}} with a black man, has become perhaps the <b>most</b> beloved <b>of</b> <b>his</b> young <b>adult</b> novels. It took only three weeks to complete, and has seen worldwide sales around four million. Taylor based {{the character of the}} boy in his book on a childhood friend. [...] "The one thing I remembered about him was that his mother had taught him to hate black people and to hate them with a passion," [...] Taylor once told a reporter from the Los Angeles Times. In the book, the boy sheds his racist views as he learns to admire and respect the black man who rescues him from the ocean, especially after he goes blind.

5000|$|Tying in {{with the}} nostalgia craze, several stars of the late 1950s and early 1960s {{successfully}} revived their careers during the early- to mid-1970s after several years <b>of</b> inactivity.

In addition, Perry Como—one <b>of</b> the <b>most</b> successful pre-rock era artists—enjoyed continued success, albeit on a somewhat smaller scale (as <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fans were <b>adults</b> who grew up during the 1940s and early 1950s, and not the rock record-buying youth); <b>his</b> <b>most</b> successful hits <b>of</b> the decade were [...] "It's Impossible" [...] (1970) and the Don McLean song [...] "And I Love Her So" [...] (1973).Two <b>of</b> popular music's <b>most</b> successful artists died within six weeks {{of each other in}} 1977: Elvis Presley (on August 16) and Bing Crosby (on October 14).
