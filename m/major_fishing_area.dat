40|$|Introduction The {{southwest}} {{coast of}} India, {{like the rest}} of the Indian Ocean is an area which is strongly influenced by the monsoon winds. During the southwest (SW) monsoon, the surface current is southward and upwelling occurs along the coast. The current reverses during the northeast monsoon (NE) and flows northward as the thermocline deepens. The continental shelf is one of the <b>major</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>areas</b> in India, due to the upwelling which leads to a supply of nutrients in the oxygen depleted waters which is continually being replenished by water from greater depths, giving a high production of phytoplankton. Few investigations have previously been performed in this area and no continuous data sets are available. Banse (1968) established that upwelling of cold water takes place during the SW monsoon period, from May to October, by using hydrographic and sea level data.

40|$|In the Indian Ocean, in situ {{data are}} sparse both {{in time and}} space. Therefore, {{numerical}} models {{are one of the}} major tools for further understanding of the ocean circulation. We have implemented, validated, and done a 40 year simulation experiment forced by synoptic atmospheric data by using the Miami Isopycnic Coordinate Ocean Model (MICOM) not previously used for the Indian Ocean. The simulation results compare well to available observations including an extensive altimeter data set from ERS and TOPEX/Poseidon. The model simulation discovered an anticyclonic gyre in the southern Bay of Bengal, confirmed by altimeter data and previously unknown. This gyre is clearly influenced by the strength of the Indian Monsoon Current. From the 40 year interannual investigation, abnormal cooling as high as 4 ºC was simulated off Indonesia, {{in the eastern part of}} the Indian Ocean, and warming in the west, off Somalia, during years which coincide with negative Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). These years also coincide with Pacific Ocean El Ninõ years, except for 1961. The cooling off Indonesia is normally followed by a warming the following year. We also observed a reduction in upwelling off the southwest coast of India, which is one of the <b>major</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>areas</b> along the continental shelf, which also coincide with El Ninõ–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) years.

On the Dutch part of the Continental Shelf pipelines are used for the transportation {{of oil and gas}} and utilities liRe glycol. The mean waterdepth on this part of the North Sea varies from 20 - 40 meters. As this region is a <b>major</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>area</b> while in some places the pipelines cross the shipping lanes the authorities demand that pipelines are buried to a depth of 1. 00 m {{below the surface of the}} seabed. In view of the high costs of the burying operation and because of some reported cases of instability an evaluation of the possibility of instability seems relevant. In some cases regulations were released to lay pipelines unprotected on top of the seabed. In these cases it was supposed that the pipeline would be buried by natural processes. After installation the behaviour of these pipelines was monitored. Although this method was not successful in all cases it could be concluded that self-burial of a pipeline is possible. The morphological aspects of potential self-burial together with a study into the forces induced by the dynamic fluid pressures have been studied in separate projects.

40|$|Abstract: In {{the present}} work, an attempt {{is made to}} {{evaluate}} and compare the diversity of invertebrate discards from small (gill/trammel nets) and medium (otter trawling) scale fisheries in Thermaikos Gulf (North Aegean Sea), which is a <b>major</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>area</b> of the eastern Mediterranean but still unexplored for its benthic community structure. Sampling was performed under normal fishing activities in 21 otter trawl hauls and 62 set nets operations. One hundred thirty-two invertebrate species were altogether discarded in medium and small scale fishery over the study area, classified in 16 classes and 7 phyla. Small scale fisheries yielded almost 70 % of the total invertebrate diversity, while otter trawling only 50 %. Molluscs were the most diverse group in both fisheries followed by crustaceans and echinoderms. Multivariate analysis revealed a clear differentiation in discard species composition between the two fisheries reflecting different benthic habitats. According to the species composition of the discards certain benthic biocoenoses were identified. The Coastal terrigenous muds biocoenosis prevailed in medium scale fishing areas, accompanied by the Coastal detritic, Muddy detritic, and Bathyal mud biocoenoses. Several plant-dominated communities (mostly those of Infralittoral photophilus algae, Circalittoral sciaphilus algae, and Posidonia meadows), were recognized through small scale fishery discards. The higher diversity of the latter was attributed to the great variety of habitats and established communities in the relevant fishing grounds. These results show that invertebrate discards could contribute background data for monitoring the complex benthic system...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{regionalization}} {{methods in}} fisheries based on provinces or <b>major</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>areas,</b> includes large and arbitrary grids in which basic statistics or inferences on distribution or abundance are made. We describe {{a method for}} regionalization and analysis of fishing activities for small pelagic fisheries in the Gulf of California, based on spatial patterns of landing and catch data in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment. A fisheries database from logbooks with spatial attributes from October 2002 to June 2007 was analyzed. Landings and catching data were transformed to a Weighted Region Index (WRI) by using fuzzy logic operators. The WRI revealed fishing action centers characterized by areas with the highest WRI values, and a hierarchy for {{the relative importance of}} the regions was established. Guaymas, Desemboque de Caborca, Isla Patos, and Bahía San Rafael were the most prominent ones. An analysis of the relative frequency of species composition showed that the Pacific sardine had over 80 % abundance in the midriff islands, and remained as the most important in the upper gulf regions, while in {{the central part of the}} gulf, relative abundances of Pacific sardine and Northern anchovy were more balanced. Relative abundance of mackerel was significantly larger around Isla Patos than in any other place. Guaymas had the largest relative composition of Northern anchovy and the lowest values for Pacific sardine. Desemboque de Caborca showed the largest homogeneity in species relative composition. It is important to highlight that this results come from in situ data, while the results previously reported come from landing statistics by port. Therefore, the present method acknowledges the spatial differences of species by regions, additional to the traditional time series analysis...|$|R

40|$|Sea {{cucumbers}} (Holothuridae and Stichopodidae) {{have been}} harvested commercially {{for at least}} 1, 000 years. The world fisheries for sea cucumbers, however, are not well documented and in general are poorly managed. Depending upon the species exploited, there are two processing procedures for the sea cucumber product. Some species are eaten raw, while most commercial species are processed into a dry product called beche-de-mer or trepang. This dry product is exported to a central market such as Hong Kong and then re-exported to the consumers. In this review, recent statistics on the world sea cucumber fisheries, collected from different services, are detailed for each <b>major</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>area.</b> Case studies for each fishing area are also presented. Recent {{major changes in the}} Indo-Pacific fishery include the participation of new producer countries, the shift in the species being exploited, and an increase in the Chinese market. The expansion of the largely monospecific temperate North Pacific fisheries is also described. Statistics from Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and the Food and Agriculture Organization provide valuable information on the producer and importer countries. Particular attention is paid to the reciprocal trade of beche-de-mer between Hong Kong and Singapore. An evaluation of the world sea cucumber landings and beche-de-mer production is presented. Recent developments include an expansion of the Hong Kong market due to increased demand by China, the importance of Indonesia as a major world producer, and an increase in the fisheries of Tropical Pacific nations. This increase is best documented for New Caledonia and Fiji.

40|$|Fisheries are an {{important}} source of animal protein for most of ThailandÃ†s population, particularly in provinces on or near the coast. Between 1978 and 1997 the per capita consumption of fish averaged 24 kgâ•–capita- 1 annually. In 1995, about 535 210 people were involved in the fisheries sector and 44 % of these were engaged in small scale marine capture fisheries. Since 1982, Thailand has faced problems with the development of marine capture fisheries and their over-exploitation which has increased fishery conflicts and disputes with neighboring countries. The Gulf of Thailand is the <b>major</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>area</b> of Thailand and in 1996, it contributed approximately 70 % of the total marine catch in the country. The catch in the Gulf consisted of pelagic fish (33 %), trash fish (32 %), demersal fish (12 %), squid and cuttlefish (6 %), shrimps (5 %), crabs (2 %) and other fish (10 %). However, demersal fish and some pelagic fish in the Gulf of Thailand have been over-exploited. This is due to a combination of factors including; increasing human population, increased pressure from Thai trawlers which have lost access to foreign fishing grounds after neighboring countries declared EEZs, development in fish processing techniques and increasing demand from animal feed producers that utilize trash fish. This paper provides a broad view of the fisheries situation in Thailand, focused mainly on the Gulf of Thailand. It covers aspects of the environment, the status of resources available, the socioeconomic situation, the existing framework for management and development, and also makes recommendations for government action to develop sustainable fisheries management. The main objectives proposed for improving fishery management are: (1) promote fishersÃ† and fisher organizationsÃ† participation in fishery development; (2) optimize fishery resources and their environment so as to be sustainable and equitable; (3) increase fishery products and stabilize fishersÃ† and processorsÃ† incomes; (4) progressively develop deep sea fisheries; (5) improve export competitiveness.
