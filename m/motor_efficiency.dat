40|$|Considering that 45 % of the world's {{generated}} {{electricity is}} consumed by induction machines, determining an induction <b>motors</b> <b>efficiency</b> non-intrusively {{is of great}} importance in that it enables the machine to operate productively whilst ensuring that the energy consumed by the machine is utilized efficiently.

40|$|MSc (Electrical and Electronic Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Energy {{resources}} are under tremendous pressure with society’s ever increasing need for electricity. However, {{resources are}} becoming scarce {{and the effect}} of our power generation on the environment is cause for concern. The cost of electricity is also increasing and thus the need to reduce energy consumption is apparent. Most electrical energy generated is consumed by electric motors. Most of these motors are induction motors because they are reliable, efficient and durable. Though these motors are highly efficient, there is still room for improvement when the strain on electrical energy is taken into account. Constructing <b>motors</b> with better <b>efficiency</b> can result in a reduction in energy consumption and cost savings to the consumer. One method of increasing a <b>motor’s</b> <b>efficiency</b> is to use permanent magnets {{in the construction of the}} motor’s core. Permanent magnets eliminate the excitation losses experienced by induction machines, thereby increasing the <b>motor’s</b> <b>efficiency.</b> A retrofit design is considered because of the ease of manufacturing for motor suppliers and the ability to apply the solution to existing operating induction machines. The prototype will lay the foundation for future optimisation strategies. The optimised design should provide improved efficiency with a minimum effect on the motors already operating in industry. The design process followed uses the design principles for inductions machines and for sizing permanent magnets. The design is then verified through the use of finite element method software packages, FEMM and ANSYS Maxwell®, and validated by performance testing. A comparison is drawn between the calculated results and the results determined from the performance analysis. The retrofit design performed as expected during the testing with some discrepancies in final values attributed to the manufacturing process. However, the efficiency is lower than designed and requires the implementation of machine optimisation strategies. Master...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been renewed {{interest}} in energy efficiency in the semiconductor industry.

In this study, the results show that none of the group replacement with high <b>efficiency</b> <b>motors,</b> adjustable speed drive <b>motors,</b> and high <b>efficiency</b> lighting would yield paybacks of less than 3 years. However, the end-of-useful life replacement with high <b>efficiency</b> <b>motors</b> for abatement of exhaust and deionizing of water as well as high efficiency lighting would yield paybacks of less than 3 years.

The airwatt relates to actual airflow, while part of the electrical power (watts) consumed by a vacuum cleaner is dissipated into heat due to necessarily imperfect efficiency; two vacuum cleaners of the same airwattage have essentially the same suction, while devices of the same electrical wattage may have a difference in efficiency and thus have substantially different airwattage.|$|E
50|$|These {{may be an}} {{alternative}} where {{the issue at hand}} is starting a motor, rather than polyphase power itself. The static phase converter is used to start a three-phase motor. The motor then runs on a single phase with a synthesised third pole. However, this makes the power balance, and thus <b>motor</b> <b>efficiency,</b> extremely poor, requiring de-rating the motor (typically to 60% or less). Overheating, and quite often destruction of the motor, will result from failing to do so. (Many manufacturers and dealers specifically state that using a static converter will void any warranty.) An oversized static converter can remove the need to de-rate the motor, but at an increased cost.|$|E
