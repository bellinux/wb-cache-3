The Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis offered by the web server is based on a curated library of more 5000 predefined metabolite sets covering various human metabolic pathways (nearly 100), hundreds of human disease states (in 3 different biofluids), human biofluid and tissue locations as well as human SNP-metabolite associations (4500 different SNP associations). MSEA also allows users to upload custom metabolite sets for more specialized analysis (such as non-mammalian MSEA work). Three different enrichment analyses are supported by the server: 1) overrepresentation analysis (ORA); 2) single sample profiling (SSP) and 3) quantitative enrichment analysis (QEA). ORA analysis only needs a list of compound names. SSP and QEA need both compound names and their concentrations. Workflows, examples and other screenshot tutorials on how to use the server are available on the MSEA website.

50|$|The data {{generated}} in metabolomics usually consist of measurements performed on subjects under various conditions. These measurements may be digitized spectra, or {{a list of}} metabolite levels. In its simplest form this generates a matrix with rows corresponding to subjects and columns corresponding with metabolite levels. Several statistical programs are currently available for analysis of both NMR and mass spectrometry data. For mass spectrometry data, software is available that identifies molecules that vary in subject groups {{on the basis of}} mass and sometimes retention time depending on the experimental design. The first comprehensive software to analyze global mass spectrometry-based metabolomics datasets was developed by the Siuzdak laboratory at The Scripps Research Institute in 2006. This software, called XCMS, is freely available, has over 20,000 downloads since its inception in 2006, {{and is one of the}} most widely cited mass spectrometry-based metabolomics software programs in scientific literature. XCMS has now been surpassed in usage by a cloud-based version of XCMS called XCMS Online. Other popular metabolomics programs for mass spectral analysis are MZmine, MetAlign, MathDAMP, which also compensate for retention time deviation during sample analysis. LCMStats is another R package for detailed analysis of liquid chromatography mass spectrometry(LCMS)data and is helpful in identification of co-eluting ions especially isotopologues from a complicated metabolic profile. It combines xcms package functions and can be used to apply many statistical functions for correcting detector saturation using coates correction and creating heat plots. <b>Metabolomics</b> <b>data</b> may also be analyzed by statistical projection (chemometrics) methods such as principal components analysis and partial least squares regression.|$|E

The comparison between groups or subsets of samples within the data usually involves statistical procedures employing univariate analysis and multivariate analysis such as Partial Least Squares - Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) [...] or machine learning classification procedures such as Support Vector Machine (SVM). [...] As a result, ROCCET offers two {{different kinds of}} analytical modules - a univariate module and a multivariate module. In the univariate module single variables are evaluated (by a t-test) and ranked for their separation performance (i.e. the AUC of the ROC), including confidence intervals (CI) and a computed optimal threshold. In the multivariate module one can choose between three different techniques - SVM (support vector machine), PLS-DA (partial least squares discriminant analysis) and Random Forests for classifying and selecting metabolites or clinical variables for an optimal ROC performance. The resulting analysis produces the top-performing multi-variable model(s) based on their ROC curve characteristics. This module also presents the significant variables (clinical variables and/or metabolites) contributing to the model (via “ROC explorer”). ROCCET also supports an option to manually select specific variables {{to be included in}} a given biomarker model. These variables can be analyzed using “ROC tester”. ROCCET also supports the rigorous assessment of the quality and robustness of newly discovered biomarkers or biomarker panels using permutation testing, hold-out testing and cross-validation.ROCCET generates a variety of colorful, journal-ready graphs and tables (see Figures 1 and 2) and supports the downloading of all generated files including tables (CSV format), graphs (PNG or PDF) and the processing history as an R file (which can be read as a simple text file).

Effective methods of integrating <b>metabolomics</b> and transcriptomics <b>data</b> are highly desired. Gene and metabolic pathways represent accumulated expert knowledge in particular domains. LASSO regression is widely used for feature selection, and group LASSO incorporates prior knowledge of groups of variables. AIM: To address the current need to integrate the two data types, a novel approach {{in the framework of}} group LASSO was developed and tested using a set of <b>metabolomics</b> and transcriptomics <b>data</b> on malaria intermittent preventative treatment with pyrimethamine in Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). METHODS: Groups are predefined using biological pathways and variables in groups will be standardized separately. The leading principal components were obtained for each pathway for each of the two data types, and then combined into an integrated matrix, which together with the group information served as input for a group LASSO regression model. RESULTS: We identified multiple pathways that were top contributors to the differences due to pyrimethamine exposure in the macaques and jointly predicted the association of member genes and metabolites to plasma hemoglobin levels. DISCUSSION: By applying this integration approach via group LASSO, we identified multiple pathways that are top contributors to the differences due to pyrimethamine exposure in the macaques and jointly predicted the association of member genes and metabolites to plasma hemoglobin levels. Our findings are consistent with current literature, and provide high-quality mechanistic hypotheses.

40|$|One {{of the new}} {{expanding}} {{areas in}} functional genomics is metabolomics: measuring the metabolome of an organism. Data being generated in metabolomics studies are very diverse in nature depending on the design underlying the experiment. Traditionally, variation in measurements is conceptually broken down in systematic variation and noise where the latter contains, e. g. technical variation. There is increasing evidence that this distinction does not hold (or is too simple) for <b>metabolomics</b> <b>data.</b> A more useful distinction {{is in terms of}} informative and non-informative variation where informative relates to the problem being studied.

In contrast, due to a missing systematic linkage of the data with functional and predictive theoretical models of the underlying metabolic network the understanding of the resulting complex data sets is lacking far behind. Here, we present a biomathematical method addressing this problem by using <b>metabolomics</b> <b>data</b> for the inverse calculation of a biochemical Jacobian matrix, thereby linking computer-based genome-scale metabolic reconstruction and in vivo metabolic dynamics. The incongruity of metabolome coverage by typical metabolite profiling approaches and genome-scale metabolic reconstruction was solved by the design of superpathways to define a metabolic interaction matrix. A differential biochemical Jacobian was calculated using an approach which links this metabolic interaction matrix and the covariance of <b>metabolomics</b> <b>data</b> satisfying a Lyapunov equation.

The presented concept combines dynamic modelling strategies with large-scale steady state profiling approaches without the explicit knowledge of individual kinetic parameters.
