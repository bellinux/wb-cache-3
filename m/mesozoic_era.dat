5|$|Several early groups, now extinct, {{branched}} {{off from}} neopterygian ancestors before the teleosts appeared. These include the Pachycormiformes and Aspidorhynchiformes of the <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>era.</b> These fish had elongated bodies; some were filter-feeders, while others ate larger prey.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>era</b> is {{represented}} in the park by the model rock exposure showing a succession of beds, namely the Jurassic and Cretaceous, by models of dinosaurs and other animals known from mesozoic fossils, and by suitable vegetation - both living plants and models.|$|E
5|$|The models {{represent}} fifteen genera of extinct animals, not all dinosaurs. They {{are from}} a wide range of geological ages, and include true dinosaurs, ichthyosaurs, and plesiosaurs mainly from the <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>era,</b> and some mammals from the more recent Cenozoic era.|$|E

5000|$|Cladophlebis is an extinct genus of fern {{which grew}} {{during the late}} Paleozoic and <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>eras</b> (...) [...] It was a common plant during that time in both the {{northern}} and southern hemispheres, and belonged to the order of plants called Filicales.|$|R
5|$|Exposed in {{the middle}} of the {{mountain}} range is an assemblage of deformed andesite to dacite lava flows and volcanoclastic sediments. These basement rocks were created during the late <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>era,</b> long before the Itcha Range formed. They are similar to rocks found in the Hazelton Group, situated north of the Itcha Range, and the Ootsa Lake Group of the Intermontane Belt.|$|E
5|$|A few mineralized fossils that {{resemble}} corals {{have been found}} in rocks from the Cambrian period, and corals diversified in the Early Ordovician. These corals, which were wiped out in the Permian-Triassic extinction about , did not dominate reef construction since sponges and algae also played a major part. During the <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>era</b> rudist bivalves were the main reef-builders, but they were wiped out in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event , and since then the main reef-builders have been scleractinian corals.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} educate people about extinct forms of life, the Geological Survey of India {{installed}} lifesize fibreglass models of Rajasaurus and Titanosaurus at their Lucknow regional office. The installation is presented in an appropriate setting, with representations of plants that existed during the <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>Era.</b> Also displayed are limb bones, vertebra, eggs and coprolites of sauropod dinosaurs and fossil eggs of Rajasaurus collected from Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh.|$|E
50|$|The Pyrenees {{are older}} than the Alps: their sediments were first {{deposited}} in coastal basins during the Paleozoic and <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>eras.</b> Between 100 and 150 million years ago, during the Lower Cretaceous Period, the Bay of Biscay fanned out, pushing present-day Spain against France and applying intense compressional pressure to large layers of sedimentary rock. The intense pressure and uplifting of the Earth's crust first affected the eastern part and moved progressively to the entire chain, culminating in the Eocene Epoch.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the major}} depositional strata in the Himalaya is the Lesser Himalayan Strata from the Paleozoic to <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>eras.</b> It had a quite {{different}} marine succession during the Paleozoic, as most parts of it are sparsely fossiliferous or even devoid of any well-defined fossils. Moreover, it consists of many varied lithofacies, making correlation work more difficult. This article describes the major formations of the Paleozoic - Mesozoic Lesser Himalayan Strata, including the Tal Formation, Gondwana Strata, Singtali Formation and Subathu Formation.|$|R
5000|$|Pangaea or Pangea (...) was a supercontinent {{that existed}} {{during the late}} Paleozoic and early <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>eras.</b> It {{assembled}} from earlier continental units approximately 335 million years ago, and it began to break apart about 175 million years ago. In contrast to the present Earth and its distribution of continental mass, much of Pangaea was in the southern hemisphere and surrounded by a superocean, Panthalassa. Pangaea was the most recent supercontinent to have existed {{and the first to}} be reconstructed by geologists.|$|R
5|$|Calabozos lies in an {{area between}} thick and thin {{continental}} crust, and its eruptions are probably fed {{from a pool of}} andesitic and rhyolitic magma that sits just under its caldera. The caldera is underlain by a layer of volcaniclastic sedimentary rock from the <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>era</b> coalesced with intrusive and volcanic rocks of Tertiary age, over a layer of Precambrian-Triassic sedimentary and metamorphic rock formed from later plutons (magma intrusions). Under its northeast edge, Calabozos is cut by a north-south trending segment of sedimentary rock that includes gypsiferous and carbonates.|$|E
5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{occurred in}} the Virginia Seismic Zone, located in the Piedmont region. The Virginia Piedmont area was formed originally {{as part of a}} zone of repeated continental collisions that created the ancestral Appalachian Mountains, a process that started during the Ordovician period with the Taconic orogeny and finished during the Carboniferous Period with the Alleghanian orogeny. The reverse faults formed during the various orogenies were partly reactivated as normal faults in extension during the <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>Era</b> as the supercontinent Pangaea broke apart. During the Cenozoic Era, compression from the opening and spreading of the Atlantic has caused some of these structures to be reactivated in a reverse sense.|$|E
5|$|Many Macroolithus {{specimens}} in South China have {{double- or}} multiple-layering of cones {{on the inner}} surface of the eggshell, a pathological condition known as ovum in ovo. It is especially prevalent among eggs nearest to the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) boundary, which represents {{the end of the}} <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>Era.</b> This pathology is correlated with a higher concentration of trace elements like Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr, V, and Zn. Experiments on modern birds have demonstrated that exposure to high levels of these elements will cause them to be incorporated into the eggshell, but the precise mechanism behind the pathological multi-layering is unknown. These abnormalities presumably affected hatchability of the eggs and may {{have played a role in}} the extinction of the dinosaurs. However, the embryonic remains inside three multilayered Macroolithus-like eggs from Ganzhou appear unaffected.|$|E
50|$|The Front Range {{was created}} by the Laramide Orogeny, the last of three major mountain-building events, which {{occurred}} between 70 and 40 million years ago. Tectonic activity during the Cenozoic Era changed the Ancestral Rocky Mountains via block uplift, eventually forming the Rocky Mountains as they exist today. The geologic make-up of Rollins Pass and the surrounding areas were also affected by deformation and erosion during the Cenozoic Era. Many sedimentary rocks from the Paleozoic and <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>eras</b> exist in the basins surrounding the pass.|$|R
25|$|Reconstructions of {{tectonic plate}} {{movement}} in the past 250million years (the Cenozoic and <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>eras)</b> can be made reliably using fitting of continental margins, ocean floor magnetic anomalies and paleomagnetic poles. No ocean crust dates back further than that, so earlier reconstructions are more difficult. Paleomagnetic poles are supplemented by geologic evidence such as orogenic belts, which mark the edges of ancient plates, and past distributions of flora and fauna. The further back in time, the scarcer and harder to interpret the data get and the more uncertain the reconstructions.|$|R
5|$|Geologically, West Antarctica {{closely resembles}} the Andes {{mountain}} range of South America. The Antarctic Peninsula {{was formed by}} uplift and metamorphism of sea bed sediments during the late Paleozoic and the early <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>eras.</b> This sediment uplift was accompanied by igneous intrusions and volcanism. The most common rocks in West Antarctica are andesite and rhyolite volcanics formed during the Jurassic period. There is also evidence of volcanic activity, even after the ice sheet had formed, in Marie Byrd Land and Alexander Island. The only anomalous area of West Antarctica is the Ellsworth Mountains region, where the stratigraphy is more similar to East Antarctica.|$|R
5|$|The Crocodilia (or Crocodylia) is {{an order}} of mostly large, predatory, semiaquatic reptiles, known as crocodilians. They first {{appeared}} 83.5 million {{years ago in the}} Late Cretaceous period (Campanian stage) and are the closest living relatives of birds, as the two groups are the only known survivors of the Archosauria. Members of the order's total group, the clade Pseudosuchia, appeared about 250 million years ago in the Early Triassic period, and diversified during the <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>era.</b> The order Crocodilia includes the true crocodiles (family Crocodylidae), the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), and the gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae). Although the term 'crocodiles' is sometimes used to refer to all of these, crocodilians is a less ambiguous vernacular term for members of this group.|$|E
5|$|The first mammals (in Kemp's sense) {{appeared}} in the Late Triassic epoch (about 225 million years ago), 40 million {{years after the first}} therapsids. They expanded out of their nocturnal insectivore niche from the mid-Jurassic onwards; The Jurassic Castorocauda, for example, was a near-relative of true mammals that had adaptations for swimming, digging and catching fish. Most, if not all, are thought to have remained nocturnal (the Nocturnal bottleneck), accounting for much of the typical mammalian traits. The majority of the mammal species that existed in the <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>Era</b> were multituberculates, eutriconodonts and spalacotheriids. The earliest known metatherian is Sinodelphys, found in 125 million-year-old Early Cretaceous shale in China's northeastern Liaoning Province. The fossil is nearly complete and includes tufts of fur and imprints of soft tissues.|$|E
5|$|The mammals {{represent}} the only living Synapsida, which {{together with the}} Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The early synapsid mammalian ancestors were sphenacodont pelycosaurs, a group that produced the non-mammalian Dimetrodon. At {{the end of the}} Carboniferous period, this group diverged from the sauropsid line that led to today's reptiles and birds. The line following the stem group Sphenacodontia split-off several diverse groups of non-mammalian synapsids—sometimes referred to as mammal-like reptiles—before giving rise to the proto-mammals (Therapsida) in the early <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>era.</b> The modern mammalian orders arose in the Paleogene and Neogene periods of the Cenozoic era, after the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs, and have been among the dominant terrestrial animal groups from 66 million years ago to the present.|$|E
5|$|The NCVP is {{underlain}} by {{four large}} crustal fragments, namely Stikinia, Yukon-Tanana, Cassiar and Cache Creek. Stikinia comprises volcanic, plutonic and sedimentary rocks that {{were created in}} an island arc environment during the Paleozoic and <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>eras.</b> Mélange and abyssal peridotites, formed largely in an ancient oceanic basin, are the primary rocks of the Cache Creek Terrane. These are also Paleozoic to Mesozoic in age and are intersected by younger granitic intrusions. Yukon-Tanana and Cassiar consist of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks derived from the North American continent. The rocks of these two terranes are displaced and autochthonous in nature.|$|R
2500|$|The {{conifers}} are {{an ancient}} group, with a fossil record extending back about 300 million {{years to the}} Paleozoic in the late Carboniferous period; even many of the modern genera are recognizable from fossils 60–120 million years old. Other classes and orders, now long extinct, also occur as fossils, particularly from the late Paleozoic and <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>eras.</b> Fossil conifers included many diverse forms, the most dramatically distinct from modern conifers being some herbaceous conifers with no woody stems. Major fossil orders of conifers or conifer-like plants include the Cordaitales, Vojnovskyales, Voltziales and perhaps also the Czekanowskiales (possibly {{more closely related to}} the Ginkgophyta).|$|R

5|$|In 2016, the {{estimated}} number of dinosaur species {{that existed in}} the <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>era</b> was estimated to be 1,543–2,468. Some are herbivorous, others carnivorous, including seed-eaters, fish-eaters, insectivores, and omnivores. While dinosaurs were ancestrally bipedal (as are all modern birds), some prehistoric species were quadrupeds, and others, such as Ammosaurus and Iguanodon, could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Cranial modifications like horns and crests are common dinosaurian traits, and some extinct species had bony armor. Although known for large size, many Mesozoic dinosaurs were human-sized or smaller, and modern birds are generally small in size. Dinosaurs today inhabit every continent, and fossils show that they had achieved global distribution by at least the early Jurassic period. Modern birds inhabit most available habitats, from terrestrial to marine, and there is evidence that some non-avian dinosaurs (such as Microraptor) could fly or at least glide, and others, such as spinosaurids, had semi-aquatic habits.|$|E
5|$|Outside of the Black Hills, much {{of western}} South Dakota {{features}} rock formed during the <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>Era,</b> from 250 million to 66million years ago. At the time, much of western and central South Dakota was again {{covered by a}} shallow inland sea. Marine skeletons from this ocean settled to the seafloor and were compacted to form the sedimentary rocks in the area today. During this period, the Black Hills, which had been pushed up to an elevation of around 15,000feet (4,500m), lost around 6,000feet (1,800m) worth of rock layers due to erosion. Many of these sediments {{ended up in the}} same area as the marine deposits from the inland sea, and both contribute to western South Dakota's present-day geological makeup. In several areas in western South Dakota, tertiary deposits may also be found. These were formed between 66 and 2.5million years ago from eroded mountains to the west. There is also volcanic material deposited here that presumably came from the Yellowstone area. These layers of sedimentary rock are distinctly visible in the multi-colored rocks and cliffs of Badlands National Park.|$|E
5|$|Sinosauropteryx, as a Yixian Formation dinosaur, is {{a member}} of the Jehol Biota, the {{assemblage}} of organisms found in the Yixian Formation and overlying Jiufotang Formation. The Yixian Formation is composed largely of volcanic rocks such as andesite and basalt. Between the volcanic layers are several beds of sedimentary rocks representing deposition in a lake. The freshwater lake strata of the Yixian Formation have preserved a wide variety of plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates. Gymnosperm forests were extensive, with a few early flowering plants as well. Ostracods and insects were diverse, and bivalves and gastropods were abundant. Mammals and birds are also well-known from the formation. The setting was subject to periodic mortality events including volcanic eruptions, wildfires, and noxious gases erupting from the lakes. The climate has been interpreted as temperate, with distinct wet and dry seasons. The yearly temperature during this time period averaged about , indicating a temperate climate with unusually cold winters for the generally warm <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>era,</b> possibly due to northern China's high latitude during this time.|$|E
50|$|Around 250 {{million years}} ago, during the Paleozoic and <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>eras,</b> {{the area that}} is today New Jersey bordered {{northern}} Africa {{as part of the}} supercontinent of Pangea. The pressure of the collision between North America and Africa gave rise to the Appalachian Mountains. Around 200 million years ago, Pangea began to break apart, separating the North American continent from the African continent. Around 18,000 years ago, the most recent ice age resulted in glaciers that reached New Jersey. As the glaciers retreated, they left behind Lake Passaic, as well as many rivers, swamps, and gorges.|$|R
50|$|In the Paleozoic and Early <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>eras,</b> South America and Africa were {{connected}} in a landmass called Gondwana, {{as part of}} the supercontinent Pangaea. In the Albian, around 110 Ma, South America and Africa began to diverge along the southern Mid-Atlantic Ridge, giving rise to a landmass of Antarctica and South America. During the late Eocene, around 35Ma, Antarctica and South America separated and South America became a massive, biologically rich island-continent. During approximately 30 million years, the biodiversity of South America was isolated {{from the rest of the}} world, leading to evolution of species within the continent.|$|R

5|$|The Adriatic Sea {{sits on the}} Apulian or Adriatic Microplate, which {{separated}} from the African Plate in the <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>era.</b> The plate's movement contributed {{to the formation of}} the surrounding mountain chains and Apennine tectonic uplift after its collision with the Eurasian plate. In the Late Oligocene, the Apennine Peninsula first formed, separating the Adriatic Basin {{from the rest of the}} Mediterranean. All types of sediment are found in the Adriatic, with the bulk of the material transported by the Po and other rivers on the western coast. The western coast is alluvial or terraced, while the eastern coast is highly indented with pronounced karstification. There are dozens of marine protected areas in the Adriatic, designed to protect the sea's karst habitats and biodiversity. The sea is abundant in flora and fauna—more than 7,000 species are identified as native to the Adriatic, many of them endemic, rare and threatened ones.|$|E
5|$|E.V.O.: Search for Eden is a side-scrolling {{platformer}} action {{game where}} players must navigate {{a creature of}} their own design across a number of environments resembling Earth's past. The game is divided into five distinct geological periods: the Cambrian Period and the Ordovician Period of the Paleozoic Era ("The World Before Land") from 500 million years ago to 450 million years ago, then the Carboniferous period ("Early Creatures of Land"), the <b>Mesozoic</b> <b>Era</b> ("Age of Dinosaurs"), the late Neogene period ("Ice Age"), and finally the early Quaternary period ("Early Man"). Each period has its own map screen, which is divided into various levels. While each era takes historical liberties with both its inhabitants and time frames, the player's choices for evolution are dependent on the current era of play, ranging from aquatic bodies during the Age of Fish to mammalian physiology during the Age of Man. During the first two eras you are forced to gain a new body to progress, but once you reach the Age of Dinosaurs, a side quest {{will give you the}} option to remain as a reptile, or become a bird, gaining the ability of flight. As you enter the Ice Age as a bird or reptile, you are immediately given the option to become a mammal. You can finish the game as a reptile, bird, or mammal and the outcome is still the same, only the interaction dialogue is affected by your choices.|$|E
