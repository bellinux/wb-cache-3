40|$|ABSTRACT One of {{the reasons}} for the success of a {{productive}} culture is the correct sowing. Therefore, the seeds must be properly dosed, deposited and not damaged by the <b>metering</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the seed drill. So, the aim of this study was to evaluate in a simulator the sorghum seed deposition by a <b>metering</b> <b>mechanism</b> with continuous flow in different conditions of slope and sowing speed, and evaluate the quality of the deposited seeds assessing mechanical damage and germination. The experiment was carried out at the College of Agricultural Sciences, UNESP in Botucatu-SP, being used a simulator equipped with seed <b>metering</b> <b>mechanism</b> of helical channelled rotor type. The experimental design was randomized in a 3 x 2 factorial arrangement with six replications. The factors were three lateral slopes drill, 3 %, 8 % and 16 %, and two sowing speed, 4 and 10 km h- 1. For the damage and germination variables we added a control treatment whose seeds were evaluated without being distributed by the <b>metering</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The results indicate that increasing the lateral slope and working speed reduce the rate of seed deposition. The <b>metering</b> <b>mechanism</b> provides mechanical damage and contributes to the reduction of seed germination...|$|E

At the end of growth season (harvesting time), crop yield and the associated parameters (spike per m 2, number of grain per spike, wheat kernel) were determined.

However, wheat grain yield was significantly higher for Kesht Gostar grain drill than the other two machines in two drier years. Mean wheat grain yield was 1224 kg ha– 1. Mean wheat grain yield was the greatest (1275 kg ha- 1) for Kesht Gostar and the least (1174 Kg ha- 1) for Hamedani Barzegar grain drill. Mean straw yield was not affected by planting methods. Mean wheat straw yield was the greatest (2349 kg ha- 1) for Hamedani Barzegar grain drill, and the least (2009 Kg ha- 1) for the combination of seed broadcasting and disking. The amounts of rainfall during growing season strongly influenced wheat grain and straw yields. Mean wheat grain yield was 1572 Kg ha- 1 and 1026 Kg ha- 1 in wet year and dry years, respectively.

In particular, the net metering concept is examined with its benefits and misconceptions. Furthermore, a survey of the current operational net metering schemes in different countries in the world, such as, in Europe, USA, Canada, Thailand and Australia, is carried out. The survey indicated that there are different net metering mechanisms depending on the particularities of each country (or state in the case of USA). Especially, in Europe, only five countries are using net metering in a very simple form, such as, any amount of energy produced by the eligible RES-E technology is compensated from the energy consumed by the RES-E producer, which results to either a less overall electricity bill or to an exception in payment energy taxes. In the USA and the USA territories, any customer’s net excess generation is credited to the customer’s next electricity bill for a 12 -month billing cycle at various rates or via a combination between rates. The actual type of net excess generation (NEG) credit is decided by a number of set criteria, such as the type of RES-E technology, the RES-E capacity limit, the type of customer and the type of utility.

The Canadian Prairie Agricultural Machinery Institute (P AMI) suggests a maximum {{coefficient of variation}} (CV) of 15 % among outlets for seeding grain or applying fertilizer. P AMI does not report down-the-row variability of individual outlets. Parameters that influence variability of volumetric measuring external fluted wheels such as rotational speed of the metering wheel, product delivery rate, seed size, and cell collection lengths were examined. In the first study, external fluted wheel meters on four grain drills were tested for seed delivery variability for wheat and soybeans, both among the metering outlets and down-the-row for individual meters. Tests on two additional drills, one an air drill {{and the other with}} external fluted metering, used two sizes of soybean seeds and two travel speeds. For wheat, down-the-row CV ranged from 12. 5 to 22. 5 % and the CV among metering units ranged from 12. 5 to 21 %. For soybeans, the CV ranged from 15. 5 to 41. 5 % with the air drill having the lower CV. A faster travel speed gave a lower CV for both drills metering soybeans. In a second study, when metering wheat, the seeding rate variability due to cell size and seeding rate were evaluated. Each meter was evaluated with cells 0. 48 or 0. 96 m in length and seeding rates of 60, 80, 90, and 100 kg/ha.

40|$|The {{demand for}} cooling and {{air-conditioning}} of building is increasingly ever growing. This increase is mostly due to population {{and economic growth}} in developing countries, and also desire for a higher quality of thermal comfort. Increase {{in the use of}} conventional cooling systems results in larger carbon footprint and more greenhouse gases considering their higher electricity consumption, and it occasionally creates peaks in electricity demand from power supply grid. Solar energy as a renewable energy source is an alternative to drive the cooling machines since the cooling load is generally high when solar radiation is high. This thesis examines the performance of PV/T solar collector manufactured by Solarus company in a solar cooling system for an office building in Dubai, New Delhi, Los Angeles and Cape Town. The study is carried out by analyzing climate data and the requirements for thermal comfort in office buildings. Cooling systems strongly depend on weather conditions and local climate. Cooling load of buildings depend on many parameters such as ambient temperature, indoor comfort temperature, solar gain to the building and internal gains including; number of occupant and electrical devices. The simulations were carried out by selecting a suitable thermally driven chiller and modeling it with PV/T solar collector in Polysun software. Fractional primary energy saving and solar fraction were introduced as key figures of the project to evaluate the performance of cooling system. Several parametric studies and simulations were determined according to PV/T aperture area and hot water storage tank volume. The fractional primary energy saving analysis revealed that thermally driven chillers, particularly adsorption chillers are not suitable to be utilizing in small size of solar cooling systems in hot and tropic climates such as Dubai and New Delhi. Adsorption chillers require more thermal energy to meet the cooling load in hot and dry climates. The adsorption chillers operate in their full capacity and in higher coefficient of performance when they run in a moderate climate since they can properly reject the exhaust heat. The simulation results also indicated that PV/T solar collector have higher efficiency in warmer climates, however it requires a larger size of PV/T collectors to supply the thermally driven chillers for providing cooling in hot climates. Therefore using an electrical chiller as backup gives much better results in terms of primary energy savings, since PV/T electrical production also can be used for backup electrical chiller in a net <b>metering</b> <b>mechanism...</b>|$|E
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen a renewed {{interest}} in Variable Speed Limit (VSL) strategies. New opportunities for VSL as a freeway <b>metering</b> <b>mechanism</b> or a homogenization scheme to reduce speed differences and lane changing maneuvers are being explored. This paper examines both the macroscopic and microscopic effects of different speed limits on a traffic stream, especially when adopting low speed limits. To that end, data from a VSL experiment carried out on a freeway in Spain are used. Data include vehicle counts, speeds and occupancy per lane, as well as lane changing rates for three days, each with a different fixed speed limit (80 km/h, 60 km/h, and 40 km/h). Results reveal some of the mechanisms through which VSL affects traffic performance, specifically the flow and speed distribution across lanes, as well as the ensuing lane changing maneuvers. It is confirmed that the lower the speed limit, the higher the occupancy to achieve a given flow. This result has been observed even for relatively high flows and low speed limits. For instance, a stable flow of 1942 veh/h/lane has been measured with the 40 km/h speed limit in force. The corresponding occupancy was 33 %, doubling the typical occupancy for this flow in the absence of speed limits. This means that VSL strategies aiming to restrict the mainline flow on a freeway by using low speed limits will need to be applied carefully, avoiding conditions as the ones presented here, where speed limits have a reduced ability to limit flows. On the other hand, VSL strategies trying to get the most from the increased vehicle storage capacity of freeways under low speed limits might be rather promising. Additionally, results show that lower speed limits increase the speed differences across lanes for moderate demands. This, in turn, also increases the lane changing rate. This means that VSL strategies aiming to homogenize traffic and reduce lane changing activity might not be successful when adopting such low speed limits. In contrast, lower speed limits widen the range of flows under uniform lane flow distributions, so that, even for moderate to low demands, the under-utilization of any lane is avoided. These findings are useful for the development of better traffic models that are able to emulate these effects. Moreover, they are crucial for the implementation and assessment of VSL strategies and other traffic control algorithms. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{residential}} secondary or dual water systems for irrigation purposes {{is common in}} the western United States where water supplies are scarce. While the use of non-potable water in secondary systems has successfully curtailed demands on potable systems, experience has shown that overall water use actually increases {{with the introduction of}} a secondary supply because users commonly pay a fixed fee and have unlimited water use. While water metering and billing effectively reduce water use, there are two main obstacles to the widespread installation of meters in secondary systems. The first obstacle is that standard residential water meters do not normally function in debris-filled secondary water. <b>Metering</b> <b>mechanisms</b> can clog or be degraded by suspended debris of both organic and inorganic nature in the water. By way of innovative meter designs or filtration, a few secondary systems have had success metering their secondary water. Other systems have experimented with possible debris-resistant meters but have had little success. In addition to the physical limitations of water meters, secondary systems face economic obstacles from the increased expense of metering. Since secondary water is intended to be an inexpensive alternative to potable water for outdoor irrigation, any cost increase due to the expense of meters, filtration, meter reading, etc., interferes with the main objective of a secondary system. A system-specific economic analysis is necessary to determine the financial feasibility of the implementation of metering in any secondary system. The objective of this research is to identify feasible ways for metering secondary water systems. An overall analysis is made of the performance, benefits, and drawbacks of each technological approach. Approximate costs and design requirements of these technologies are identified, thereby allowing water suppliers to determine the economic feasibility of metering.

40|$|Site Specific Crop Management is a {{technique}} by which agricultural inputs such as seed, fertilizer and herbicides are adjusted to match the requirements of specific field areas. Agricultural machines must apply the correct application rate at each field location. One possibility is to add a controller to obtain variable rate capability from conventional <b>metering</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for uniform application. ^ Two control systems for variable rate capability with conventional grain drills were evaluated in this study. Both were operator controlled open loop systems. ^ One system used a set of rate switches. An electric linear actuator moved the meter adjustment lever and contacted limit switches for each rate setting of external fluted wheel meters. The other system used a rheostat to control the speed of an electric motor driving internal fluted wheel meters. ^ Seeding rate and rate change response were determined by operating the drills over a course of artificial turf mats. A four-parameter sigmoid model described the distribution profile. ^ The linear actuator system response time averaged 5. 6 s for a 20 kg/ha rate increase. The response time varied considerably for a 10 kg/ha increase and was inconsistent for decreased rates. ^ For rotary actuation, response times varied from 3 to 9 s depending upon the rate change magnitude. This control system performed well for rate increases and decreases. ^ Finally, theoretical guidelines were developed to characterize the transition area accompanying a change from one application rate to another. Response time was divided into (1) actuation lag and (2) actuator mechanical response. Actuation lag was greater for the linear actuator. Generally, the mechanical response was longer for decreasing rates. For a 10 kg/ha rate change, the 68 % confidence interval lower limit of the final rate overlapped the 68 % confidence interval upper limit of the initial rate. With a 20 kg/ha change, no rate overlap occurred. More variability {{was associated with the}} estimation of the inflection point of the sigmoid curve for 10 kg/ha than for 20 kg/ha. This indicates that the metering systems were less suitable for smaller rate changes. ...|$|R
40|$|Swedish {{agricultural}} soils {{are reported to}} receive an annual application of plant nutrients as fertilizer amounting to a value almost as large the total new-investment made during one year. Poor precision in nutrient supply results in yield decreases and environmental loading. The purpose of this work is to summarize the knowledge available today on factors that influence fertilizer distribution achieved by pneumatic fertilizer spreaders. The work is mainly concentrated on technical design parameters that influences the spreading uniformity parallel to and {{at right angles to}} the direction of travel. The average coefficient of variation for the evenness of spreading of today’s fertilizer spreaders is 25 % in the field. In practise, there is no significant difference between centrifugal spreaders and pneumatic spreaders. During the work of which this report accounts for, 87 Swedish and international references have been studied in order to find factors influencing the result of fertilizer spreading. Factors influencing the spreading result can be divided into: the fertilizer, the machine, the field the weather and the operator. The flow properties of the fertilizer and its tendency to deposit on working mechanism are affected by its physical properties. The particle size distribution influences length of throw, flow properties and tendency of separation. The durability of the fertilizer will affect the particle size distribution. Particle shape and surface texture affect the flow properties. Density influences throw properties. Hygroscopicity influences water uptake and thereby flow properties and tendency to deposit within the machine. Thixotropic fertilizers lead to hard deposits being placed on working mechanisms and transport ducts against which the fertilizer glides. The machine can be divided into fertilizer hopper, feeder mechanism, fan, piping, spreader boom and spreader mechanism. When filling a hopper separation generally occurs. Severe separation influences the resulting distribution. When emptying the hopper the slope of the floor will influence the amount of fertilizer remaining in the hopper. 60 — 65 ° slope of the bottom of the hopper will ensure complete emptying. Metering mechanisms can be divided into active and passive mechanisms. The function of passive mechanisms depend on the flow properties of the fertilizer. The studded roller is a semi-active <b>metering</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Cyclic variations in out-flow may occur in metering devices that measure out the fertilizer in portions, e. g. cell wheels, star wheels and augers. Shaking and slope of hopper influences the mass flow from passive metering mechanisms. The fan is used to transport the fertilizer within the machine. The flow of air can be used to reduce drift caused by wind if both the flow of fertilizer and the flow of air are directed downwards at the spreading mechanism. At high fertilizer application rates the fan-pipe system in modern fertilizer spreaders tend to overload, with pulsating flows as a result. These pulsating flows are reflected in a severe deterioration of the spreading uniformity. The piping functions as a way of transport of the fertilizer. Piping with a high coefficient of friction leads to a rapidly attained even radial distribution of granules in the pipe. Curves induces pressure losses and deteriorated radial distribution in the pipe. Bends immediately before the spreading mechanism should be avoided. Movements of the spreader boom influences the final result of fertilizer spreading. Boom movements occur {{largely as a result of}} the torque of the fertilizer vehicle along its respective longitudinal and vertical axles. The response of a boom suspension to the rolling motion of the vehicle to which it is attached should be such that the boom is insulated from the high frequency random rolling movements but is able to follow the low frequency undulations of the ground. An example of such a boom suspension is found in the literature. In the literature, spreader mechanisms are found in many different shapes. Significant for the majority of them is that their evenness of distribution is sensitive to the radial distribution of granules in the pipe immediately before entering the spreader mechanism. The evenness of distribution is also sensitive to the working height above the ground. The field will through its geometry (shape, slope and bumpiness) affect the working result in form of unevennesses in the spreading pattern, gaps and overlapping. Soil type variations and varying cultivation capacity demand variable application rates. The weather factors that mainly influence the spreading accuracy are wind speed, air temperature and relative humidity. The wind speed influences the length and direction of throw. Air temperature and moisture are together with the temperature of the fertilizer decisive for the water uptake of the fertilizer. Large water uptake will change the flow properties of the fertilizer in a negative direction. The operator is the overall regulator in the "granule spreading system". The operator adjusts and maintain the machine. It is the operator who choses driving technique and the way the work is done. A technically very good fertilizer spreader cannot compensate fully for a bad operator. The operator should have assistance in steering the tractor and information of and possibility to adjust the application rate. What requirements can be placed on the future fertilizer spreader? The requirements placed on the fertilizer spreader of the future involve large control ability, i. e. high spreading accuracy and possibility to continuously vary the application rate. Furthermore, some kind of control over the mass flow of fertilizer will be needed. This review of the literature is concluded with a presentation of a new type of fertilizer spreader. The concept gives precedence to low manufacturing cost, active <b>metering</b> <b>mechanism,</b> variable mass flow and even distribution of fertilizer to the spreader mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Since the {{application}} of pneumatic planters for seeds with different physical properties is growing, {{it is essential to}} evaluation the performance of these machines to improve the operating parameters under different pressures and forward speeds. To evaluate the performance of precision vacuum seeders numerous procedures of laboratory and field have been developed and their feed mechanism evaluation is of great importance. The use of instrumentation is essential in laboratory procedures. Many systems have been designed, using instrumentation, to be able to monitor seed falling trajectory and as a result, in those systems the precise place of falling seed in the seed bed could be determined. In this study, the uniformity of seed spacing of a seed drill was determined using of high speed camera with a frame rate of 480 frames s- 1. So that, the uniformity of planting was statistically significant {{under the influence of the}} speed of seed metering rollers (Karayel et al., 2006). Singh et al. (2005) studied the effects of disk rotation speed, vacuum pressure and shape of seed entrance hole on planting spacing uniformity using uniformity indices under laboratory and field conditions. They reported miss index values were reduced as the pressure was increased but they were increased with increasing of the speed. The multiple indices on the other hand were low at higher speed but they were increased as the pressure was increased. Ground speed was affected by changes in engine speed and gear selection, both of which effect on amount of fan rotation speed for different pressures. The aim of this study was to identify and determine the effects of forward speed and optimum vacuum pressure amount of the pneumatic seeder. Materials and Methods: The pneumatic planter (Unissem) was mounted on a tractor (MF 399) and passed over the soil bin. Thus, the acquired data would be more reliable and practical. To do so, the tractor was equipped with electronic devices for online measurement of various parameters, including: the actual forward speed, wheel sleep percent, drawbar pull, motor RPM, and fuel consumption. Wheel drive of the seed <b>metering</b> <b>mechanism</b> was equipped with Rotary Encoder model S 48 - 8 - 0360 ZT (TK 1) to determine the seed disk rotation. For more precise vacuum pressure monitoring, a Vacuum Transmitter model BT 10 - 210 was used to measure relative pressure from 0 mbar to - 1000 mbar. Investigation of seed falling trajectories was conducted using the AVI video acquisition system consisted of CCD (charge-coupled device) camera (Fuji F 660 EXR) capable of capturing images with a constant speed of 320 frames per second and a spatial resolution of 320 × 240 pixels. All data were transmitted to a data logger and displayed online on the PC's screen. For optimization of the factors affecting the performance of the pneumatic planter, the experiments were conducted with: two ranges of forward speeds [3 to 4 km h- 1, and 6 to 8 km h- 1; three levels of vacuum pressure [- 2. 5 kPa, - 3. 5 kPa and - 4. 5 kPa]; and two types of seed [cucumber and watermelon], keeping a three-factor factorial experimental design. The tests were replicated three times. The uniformity of seed spacing was measured with indicators described by kachman and smith (1995) which are defined as: I_miss=N_ 1 /N× 100 										(1) I_mul=N_ 2 /N× 100 										 (2) I_qf= 100 -(I_mul+I_miss) 									(3) P=s_d/x_ref 											 (4) Which for planting distance of 45 cm, N 1 is number of spacing > 1. 5 Xref; N 2 is number of spacing ≤ 0. 5 Xref and N is total number of measured spacings, Sd is standard deviation of the spacing more than half but not more than 1. 5 times, the set spacings Xref, Imiss is the miss index, Imul is the multiple index, quality of feed index Iq is the percentage of spacings that are more than half but not more than 1. 5 times, the set planting distance and P is error index. Results and Discussion: According to the studies on both watermelon and cucumber, the ‘quality of feed index’ value in forward speed rang of 6 to 8 km h- 1 was less than one in forward speed rang of 3 to 4 km h- 1. Also, the ‘error index’ value in forward speed rang 3 to 4 km h- 1 was little rather than forward speed rang of 6 to 8 km h- 1, but it was desirable. For watermelon and cucumber seeds, the ‘quality of feed index’ were the maximum with mean of 97...|$|E

40|$|Our {{international}} team has recently recognized a role of nanotechnology in vibration damping {{and discovered that}} enhanced vibration damping can be provided via nano-scale reinforcements where at least one dimension limited to between 1 - 100 nanometres and carbon nanotubes (CNT) are particularly the strongest and most flexible molecular costdecreasing materials because of C-C covalent bonding and seamless hexagonal network architecture [1, 2]. A novel concept of nanoparticle vibration damping [3] shows the effect that molecule-level mechanism can have on the damping and that nanoparticles/fibres/tubesreinforced materials can provide enhanced strength and vibration damping properties. It is particularly worth noting that carbon nanotubes {{can act as a}} simple nanoscale spring and thus can be used in many engineering applications, particularly, for enhanced vibration damping and strength of materials.

40|$|Abstract—The actual {{situation}} in smart metering {{is characterized by}} a coexistence {{of a large number of}} proprietary and open standards for wired as well as wireless communication. These standards show low or no interoperability to each other. Therefore, it is very difficult to integrate multi-vendor solutions using one sustainable holistic approach. The proposed approach is to use Web Service technology as an open widespread Internet standard for the creation of a heterogeneous network for smart metering devices. Smart metering is an emerging topic for realizing modern energy policies. Monitoring, analyzing, and controlling of power consumption is the precondition for optimizing energy strategies. This work focuses on the integration of Web Service technology in the area of smart <b>meter</b> communication.

A model is developed using SIMUL 8 to simulate two conditions for entry of vehicles into highway namely, with metering and without metering. For the metering condition, traffic responsive ramp meter is modelled. Due to the software limitations, the level of simulation that can be developed is to the macroscopic level. The metering effectiveness is studied by investigating some parameters such as average total travel time, total throughput and ramp delay. The model is calibrated, verified and validated before analysis.

40|$|Introduction Improving the {{efficiency}} of all agricultural operations has always been important for farmers and engineers. It {{is well known that}} the force required for cutting a soil using narrow blades is a function of soil and environmental physical properties, tool shape geometry and the tool’s surface characteristics like soil-tool adhesion and friction. Soil tool adhesion can reduce ploughing efficiency and quality. It may also halt the movement of tillage machines in more severe conditions. Adhesion can also disable some machine abilities, which can result in a significant reduction of machine performance. Adhesion of the soil to seed-bed preparation tools like furrowers can significantly affect the germination rate. Reducing soil tool adhesion of furrowers can reduce draft force and improve ploughing efficiency. Many researchers have worked on methods of reducing draft force by modifying the surface material and/or surface texture of the plough tools. A good prediction on draft force of a tool before producing it has always been important for farmers and engineers. There are some models for predicting the draft force of narrow blades in soil. McKyes-Ali’s model is widely used because of its accuracy and simplicity. Ultra-high molecular weight polythene (UHMW-PE) is a polymer with ultra-high weight and long molecular chains and is well known for its outstanding physical and chemical properties and self-cleaning abilities, which reduce soil-tool adhesion. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate usability of UHMW-PE coated furrower tines for draft force. Analytical and experimental investigations were carried out during the research. A comparison was conducted between the analytical and the experimental method. The results of this comparison can be used to determine reliability of the analytical model for predicting the draft force improvement caused by the surface modification on tines using different surface coatings. Materials and Methods Eight tines have been built. Four of them had a thick coating layer of UHMW-PE, and the other four were made of pure mild steel. Each set of the tines have been installed on a four shanked chisel plough chassis and then attached to a tractor. The draft force required for pulling the furrowers attached to the tractor has been measured by a simple load <b>meter</b> <b>mechanism</b> connecting two tractors. Draft force has been measured in two different speeds. Slip ratio of the tractor has been recorded. Each test has been repeated three times. McKyes-Ali’s proposed model for evaluating the draft force of narrow blades has been chosen to predict draft force of the traditional steel furrower tines and the surface coated ones. To drive the model, a computer program has been coded in the script environment of Matlab software. The model required some of the mechanical properties of the soil and the tool to operate. Specific gravity, cohesion and internal friction angle of the soil have been measured by routine laboratory methods. Soil-tool adhesion and friction of the mild steel and the UHMW-PE plates have been measured using the direct shear apparatus. Results and Discussions MkKyes-Ali’s model has predicted draft forces with an accuracy of 90...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—After {{a decade}} of development, Imote 2 is {{becoming}} a de facto standard for a computer-equipped sensor. Attracted by its wireless feature, {{an increasing number of}} applications are now trying to use Imote 2 as part of their supporting hardware. These applications range from medicare, structural health monitoring, to building management systems and railway monitoring. Their widely diverse requirements call for Imote 2 to equip off-theshelf modules so that the applications can seamlessly integrate Imote 2 into their systems. Conventionally, an Imote 2 records sensor readings and sends the data to a base station, i. e., a near-by Imote 2 connected to a computer. This requires a computer to be placed in a close range of the Imote 2 sensors (usually less than 200 <b>meters).</b> Such <b>mechanism</b> is not universally suitable. Especially, some applications cannot afford to place a computer unattended (e. g., in the field or in an ad hoc location in a building). There are other applications that need high data rate. We develop a longrange high-rate communication module for Imote 2. Integrated with our module, the data of an Imote 2 can be send to a server anywhere using 3 G and the data rate can reach 520 K bps. In this demo, we will show our enhanced Imote 2. We will show videos of a few projects, including high-speed railway monitoring and building management systems, using our enhanced Imote 2 based sensor networks. I...|$|R
