It is also shown that transversely finite beams cannot be purely transverse in both their electric and magnetic vectors, and that their electromagnetic energy travels at less than c. The electric and magnetic fields in an electromagnetic beam have different polarization properties in general, but there exists a class of steady beams in which the electric and magnetic polarizations are the same (and in which energy density and energy flux are independent of time).

40|$|Laboratory optics, {{typically}} {{dealing with}} <b>monochromatic</b> <b>light</b> <b>beams</b> {{in a single}} reference frame, exhibits numerous spin-orbit interaction phenomena due to the coupling between the spin and orbital degrees of freedom of light. Here we examine transformations of paraxial photon states carrying the spin and orbital angular momenta (AM) under the Lorentz boosts between different reference frames. We show that transverse boosts inevitably produce a rather nontrivial conversion from spin to orbital AM. The converted part is then separated between the intrinsic (vortex) and extrinsic (transverse shift or Hall effect) contributions. Although, the spin, intrinsic-orbital, and extrinsic-orbital parts all point in different directions, such complex behavior {{is necessary for the}} proper Lorentz transformation of the total AM of light. Relativistic spin-orbit interactions can be important in scattering processes involving photons and other relativistic particles, as well as when studying light emitted by fast-moving bodies.

40|$|A {{simplified}} optical method, {{based on}} interference phenomena of diffused light, is described for {{the determination of}} isopachic patterns. The procedure consists in using a <b>monochromatic</b> diffused <b>light</b> <b>beam</b> to illuminate the model surface. If an optically flat glass plate, used as datum plane, is brought {{in contact with the}} model front surface an interference pattern is produced related to the thickness of the air-film between the datum plane and the surface of the model. Interference patterns before and after loading of the specimen allow the determination of isopachics. Curves of variation of interference fringes throughout the surface of the specimen, before their use for the determination of thickness variation, must be readjusted in convenient scale {{as well as for the}} elimination of superimposed simple interference patterns due to arbitrary inclination of the datum optical plane before and after loading. The method does not necessitate a complicated equipment. It is straightforward and very sensitive. It can be applied to transparent as well as to opaque models made of metal sheets. It can also be used as a supplementary means to measure thickness-strains in the birefringent coating method. The surface of the model though polished could not be obligatorily optically flat.

A somewhat different application of the statistical approach—light trapping—is reviewed at a fundamental level, and the future potential is considered for devices which combine such a ‘thermodynamic squeezing’ of light with latest developments in photonics, leading to a photonic bandgap solar cell. We argue that the widespread use of thermodynamic tools in the current photovoltaics research, especially when combined with the potential benefits to future devices, already indicates that our thinking should not be about if but how thermodynamics can guide us to make better solar cells...|$|E

In order to create and control nanoscale light localizations, this thesis has investigated into two research topics with different types of nanophotonic metamaterials: precise control of near-field light localizations and subwavelength light concentration beyond the near field. For the first topic, (i) I have demonstrated for the first time that a planar fish-scale metamaterial can be used as a controllable template for nanoscale light localizations. By tuning the polarization and wavelength of an incident <b>light</b> <b>beam,</b> the positions of energy hot-spots on the landscape of the metamaterial can be efficiently controlled. Moreover, it has been found that the locations of the hot-spots show a high correlation with the nanostructure, the unit cell size, and the dipole absorption resonance of the fish-scale metamaterial. In an array of discrete asymmetrically split-ring meta-molecules system, (ii) I have also demonstrated for the first time that the well-isolated subwavelength energy hot-spots can be created and positioned on the metamaterial landscape by the coherent control of a <b>monochromatic</b> continuous <b>light</b> <b>beam</b> with a spatially modulated phase profile. Due to the strong optically induced interactions between meta-molecules, a well-isolated energy hot-spot of a fraction of wavelength has been created. By simply tailoring the phase profile, the hot-spot positions on the metamaterial can be prescribed and moved at will from one meta-molecule to another in a digital fashion with an accurate moving step around lambda/ 2. In my experiments, (iii) I have integrated a scanning near-field optical microscope and a spatial light modulator to demonstrate the coherent control process. Via this approach, an energy concentration on the nanoscale and accurate control of the energy hot-spots have been achieved. For the second topic, based on optical super-oscillation, (iv) I have first created an isolated focused spot by using a super-oscillating binary masks with radially symmetric quasi-periodic arrangement of nanoholes. The well-isolated focused spot around 0. 45 lambda has been acquired in a wide field of view about 90 lambda.
