5|$|The Exposition Universelle (1867) (Paris Exhibition) {{devoted a}} stand to the <b>metric</b> <b>system</b> and by 1875, {{two thirds of}} the European {{population}} and close to half the world's population had adopted the <b>metric</b> <b>system.</b> By 1872, the only principal European countries not to have adopted the <b>metric</b> <b>system</b> were Russia and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century the <b>metric</b> <b>system</b> of weights and {{measures}} proved a convenient political compromise during the unification processes in the Netherlands, Germany and Italy. In 1814, Portugal became the first country {{not part of the}} French Empire to officially adopt a <b>metric</b> <b>system.</b> Spain found it expedient in 1858 to follow the French example and within a decade Latin America had also adopted the <b>metric</b> <b>system.</b> There was considerable resistance to metrication in the United Kingdom and in the United States, though once the United Kingdom announced its metrication program in 1965, the Commonwealth followed suit.|$|E
5|$|In 1817, the Netherlands reintroduced the <b>metric</b> <b>system,</b> but used pre-revolutionary names—for example 1centimetre {{became the}} duim (thumb), the ons (ounce) became 100g and so on. Certain German states adopted similar systems and in 1852 the German Zollverein (customs union) adopted the zollpfund (customs pound) of 500g for intrastate commerce. In 1872 {{the newly formed}} German Empire adopted the <b>metric</b> <b>system</b> as its {{official}} system of weights and measures and the newly formed Kingdom of Italy likewise, following the lead given by Piedmont, adopted the <b>metric</b> <b>system</b> in 1861.|$|E

5|$|The {{usage of}} the <b>metric</b> <b>system</b> varies around the world. According to the US Central Intelligence Agency's Factbook (2007), the International System of Units has been adopted as the {{official}} system of weights and measures by all {{nations in the world}} except for Myanmar (Burma), Liberia and the United States, while the NIST has identified the United States as the only industrialised country where the <b>metric</b> <b>system</b> is not the predominant system of units. However, reports published since 2007 hold this is no longer true of Myanmar or Liberia. An Agence France-Presse report from 2010 stated that Sierra Leone had passed a law to replace the imperial system with the <b>metric</b> <b>system</b> thereby aligning its system of measurement with that used by its Mano River Union (MRU) neighbours Guinea and Liberia. Reports from Myanmar suggest that the country is also planning to adopt the <b>metric</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|When the SI {{standard}} {{was published in}} 1960, the only major Commonwealth country to have adopted the <b>metric</b> <b>system</b> was India. In 1863, the first reading of {{a bill that would}} have made the <b>metric</b> <b>system</b> compulsory passed its first reading in the House of Commons by 110 votes to 75. The bill, however, failed to make the statute book because of lack of parliamentary time. In 1965, after this and similar false starts the then Federation of British Industry informed the British Government that its members favoured the adoption of the <b>metric</b> <b>system.</b> The rationale behind the request was that 80% of British exports were to countries that used the <b>metric</b> <b>system</b> or that were considering changing to the <b>metric</b> <b>system.</b> The Board of Trade, on behalf of the Government, agreed to support a ten-year metrication programme. The government agreed to a voluntary policy requiring minimal legislation and costs to be borne where they fell. SI would be used from the outset. The rest of the Commonwealth, South Africa and Ireland followed within a few years; in some countries such as South Africa and Australia metrication was mandatory rather than voluntary.|$|E

50|$|The Chinese system's most {{commonly}} used units were 里 (li), 丈 (tseung/cheung), 尺 (tsek/chek), 寸 (tsun/chun), 分 (fen/fan) in descending scale order. These units are now rarely used in daily life, the Imperial and <b>Metric</b> <b>systems</b> being preferred.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} {{variants}} of the <b>metric</b> <b>system</b> evolved, all using the Mètre des Archives and Kilogramme des Archives (or their descendants) as their base units, but differing in {{the definitions of}} the various derived units.|$|E
5|$|By 1920, {{countries}} comprising 22% of the world's population, mainly English-speaking, {{used the}} imperial system or the closely related US customary system; 25% used mainly the <b>metric</b> <b>system</b> {{and the remaining}} 53% used neither.|$|E
5|$|In 1895 another Parliamentary select {{committee}} recommended the compulsory {{adoption of the}} <b>metric</b> <b>system</b> after a two-year permissive period. The 1897 Weights and Measures Act legalised the metric units for trade, but did not make them mandatory. A bill to make the <b>metric</b> <b>system</b> compulsory in order to enable the British industrial base to fight off {{the challenge of the}} nascent German base passed through the House of Lords in 1904, but did not pass in the House of Commons before the next general election was called. Following opposition by the Lancashire cotton industry, a similar bill was defeated in 1907 in the House of Commons by 150 votes to 118.|$|E

50|$|<b>Metric</b> <b>systems</b> {{of units}} have evolved since the {{adoption}} of the first well-defined system in France in 1795. During this evolution the use of these systems has spread throughout the world, first to non-English-speaking countries, and then to English speaking countries.|$|R

5|$|The Cisalpine Republic, a North Italian {{republic}} {{set up by}} Napoleon in 1797 {{with its}} capital at Milan first adopted a modified form of the <b>metric</b> <b>system</b> based in the braccio cisalpino (Cisalpine cubit) which was defined to be half a metre. In 1802 the Cisalpine Republic was renamed the Italian Republic, with Napoleon as its head of state. The following year the Cisalpine system of measure {{was replaced by the}} <b>metric</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} {{coherence}} was only {{introduced into the}} <b>metric</b> <b>system</b> {{in the third quarter}} of the 19th century; in its original form the <b>metric</b> <b>system</b> was non-coherent—in particular the litre was 0.001m3 and the are (from which the hectare derives) was 100m2. However the units of mass and length were related to each other through the physical properties of water, the gram having been designed as being the mass of one cubic centimetre of water at its freezing point.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the <b>metric</b> <b>system</b> into France in 1795 was done on a district by district basis with Paris being the first district, but by modern standards the transition was poorly managed. Although thousands of pamphlets were distributed, the Agency of Weights and Measures who oversaw the introduction underestimated the work involved. Paris alone needed 500,000 metre sticks, yet {{one month after the}} metre became the sole legal unit of measure, they only had 25,000 in store. This, combined with other excesses of the Revolution and the high level of illiteracy made the <b>metric</b> <b>system</b> unpopular.|$|E
50|$|Varnams are {{generally}} sung in two varieties of talas, or <b>metric</b> <b>systems,</b> Adi Tala (8 beat cycle) and Ata Tala (14 beat cycle), where Ata Tala varnams {{are generally}} more complicated and advanced. In most of the Adi Tala Varnams the tala {{is placed in the}} 2 kalai version. So therefore each beat and finger count is placed twice.|$|R
5|$|Gravitational <b>metric</b> <b>systems</b> use the {{kilogram-force}} (kilopond) as a {{base unit}} of force, with mass measured in a unit known as the hyl, Technische Mass Einheit (TME), mug or metric slug. Although the CGPM passed a resolution in 1901 defining the standard value of acceleration due to gravity to be 980.665cm/s2, gravitational units {{are not part of}} the International System of Units (SI).|$|R
25|$|Each {{unit and}} each prefix in the <b>metric</b> <b>systems</b> has been {{allocated}} a unique symbol by the CGPM. Unlike abbreviations {{which are a}} contraction of the local word for the unit in question, and which can therefore differ from one language to another, SI symbols are a form of standardised mathematical notation to represent the units and are the same in any language (compare chemical symbols).|$|R
5|$|The <b>metric</b> <b>system,</b> that is {{the system}} of units based on the metre, was officially adopted in France on 10December 1799 (19frimaire AnVIII) and became the sole legal system of weights and {{measures}} there from 1801.|$|E
5|$|The uncoordinated {{use of the}} <b>metric</b> <b>system</b> by {{different}} scientific and engineering disciplines, particularly in the late 19th century, resulted in different choices of base units even though all {{were based on the}} same definitions of the units of the metre and the kilogram. During the 20th century, efforts were made to rationalise these units, and in 1960, the CGPM published the International System of Units, which has since then been the internationally recognised standard <b>metric</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|These {{features}} {{had already}} been explored and expounded by various scholars and academics in the two centuries prior to the French <b>metric</b> <b>system</b> being implemented.|$|E

50|$|Giving his judgment, Lord Justice John Laws {{accepted}} that the appellants were correct in {{arguing that the}} 1985 Act provided for both the Imperial and <b>metric</b> <b>systems</b> to operate side by side.
