40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} <b>microbiological</b> <b>risks</b> associated with space exploration and identify potential countermeasures available. Identification of microbial risks associated with space habitation requires knowledge of the sources and expected types of microbial agents. Crew data along with environmental data from water, surfaces, air, and free condensate are utilized in risk examination. Data from terrestrial models are also used. Microbial risks to crew health include bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses. Adverse effects of microbes include: infections, allergic reactions, toxin production, release of volatiles, food spoilage, plant disease, material degradation, and environmental contamination. Risk is difficult to assess because of unknown potential changes in microbes (e. g., mutation) and the human host (e. g., immune changes). Prevention of adverse microbial impacts is preferred over remediation. Preventative measures include engineering measures (e. g., air filtration), crew microbial screening, acceptability standards, and active verification by onboard monitoring. Microbiological agents are important risks to human health and performance during space flight and risks increase with mission duration. Acceptable risk level must be defined. Prevention must be given high priority. Careful screening of crewmembers and payloads is an important element of any risk mitigation plan. Improved quantitation of <b>microbiological</b> <b>risks</b> is a high priority...|$|R

40|$|At {{present in}} Spain, placing raw milk or cream {{on the market}} for direct human {{consumption}} is not restricted or prohibited if all requirements set out by Regulation (EC) No 853 / 2004 are met. However, direct supply of small quantities of raw milk from the producer to the end consumer or to local retail establishments that supply it directly to the end consumer is prohibited, according to Royal Decree 640 / 2006. The Spanish Agency for Consumer Affairs, Food Safety and Nutrition (AECOSAN) is looking into the possibility of modifying Royal Decree 640 / 2006. Consequently, they have requested information from the Scientific Committee on the <b>microbiological</b> <b>risks</b> associated with consuming raw milk and raw milk-based products. The Committee was asked to draw up a report which was to take three factors into account: 1) the sale of raw milk and cream, including alternative ways of placing it on the market such as vending machines, 2) the production of raw-milk cheese aged for more than 60 days, which does not comply with somatic cell and aerobic germ criteria and 3) colostrum-related requirements.

Conclusion: The main <b>microbiological</b> <b>risk</b> factors in drinking milk is total bacterial count, coliform bacteria, Salmonella; in the kefir – coliform bacteria, yeasts and moulds.

30|$|The {{discharge}} {{of domestic and}} industrial wastewaters {{with the presence of}} pathogenic microorganisms in the adjacent water frequently threatened the microbiological quality of the water (Aslan-Yilmaz et al. 2004; Nduka and Orisakwe 2009; Dorsey et al. 2012). The <b>microbiological</b> <b>risks</b> depend on the bacteria concentration in water and on the water usage such as drinking, recreational activities, irrigation, and shellfish harvesting purposes. The microbiological quality of water is classically monitored by searching for and quantifying bacterial indicators of fecal contamination. Total coliform, fecal coliform, fecal streptococci and enterococci are among the most frequently used microbial indicators of fecal pollution (Malik and Ahmad 2002; Cabral and Marques 2006; Djuikom et al. 2006; Kovačić et al. 2011). Although not usually harmful themselves, their presence may indicate the possibility of pathogen presence (Bonadonna et al. 2002; Dorsey et al. 2012).|$|R

40|$|About 50 % of the {{drinking}} water in the Netherlands is centrally softened by {{the drinking}} water companies in {{a process known as}} pellet softening. In this process a base and seeding material are mixed in an upflow reactor, where subsequently CaCO 3 precipitates on a seed core as pellets. The seeding material is usually sand, but recently CaCO 3 was introduced as seeding material at several full scale plants. The pure calcite pellets that are produced as a by-product in these plants can be reused as seeding material, after grinding and sieving part of the produced pellets. The main advantages of this reuse are an expected significant decrease of the ecological footprint of both calcite as raw material and {{the drinking water}} treatment plants using pellet softening, and increased valorisation of the pellets.

40|$|PURPOSE: In {{order to}} avoid the <b>microbiological</b> <b>risks</b> linked to human serum albumin macroaggregates (MAA) used for lung {{perfusion}} scintigraphy, we developed a new starch-based Tc- 99 m potential radiopharmaceutical. METHODS: Microparticles were prepared from oxidised starch coupled to natural polyamine for Tc- 99 m complexation. Suspensions were formulated as ready-to-use kits for easy one-step labelling procedures. RESULTS: Particle-size analysis, electron microscopy, and confocal microscopy were performed for microparticle characterisation, and gave a typical size distribution ranging from 7 to 63 microm, with a homogenous population of spherical or oval-shaped microparticles. Radiochemical purity exceeded 95 %, and was stable for at least 8 h. When challenged with histidine and human plasma, labelling was also stable. Dynamic scintigraphic acquisitions and biodistribution studies conducted on healthy Wistar rats showed a tracer accumulation with more than 80 % of the ID in the lungs after 15 min. CONCLUSIONS: With clinically significant characteristics such as a lung half-life of 3 h, a lung-to-vascular ratio of 900, and a lung-to-liver ratio of 90, starch-based microparticles exhibit all the qualities for an effective new lung perfusion agent...|$|R
40|$|Great {{attention}} has been paid to the potential of wastewater irrigation as a sustainable water source, particularly due to water scarcity and water pollution issues. However, few studies have focused on its adverse effects and on the health risks it may pose. In this study, the physicochemical properties of soils and plants irrigated with rural domestic wastewater and associated <b>microbiological</b> <b>risks</b> were investigated. The results showed that sewage irrigation could increase the production of vegetables and improve soil fertility. While the nitrate content of plants increased significantly, pathogens on plants and in soils increased after irrigation with raw wastewater. In particular, there was a wide range of pathogenic bacteria in the phyllosphere, which may indicate risks if contaminated vegetables are consumed directly. Treated wastewater irrigation was not significantly different from controls, which were irrigated by tap water; consequently, it can be used as an alternative water resource for agricultural irrigation. The presence of a wide spectrum pathogens in wastewater shows the necessity of long-term monitoring and further evaluation...|$|R

40|$|The current quality {{assurance}} and control tools and methods to prevent and/or to control <b>microbiological</b> <b>risks</b> associated with fresh produce are challenged {{due to the}} following pressures upon the food supply chain, i. e. changing consumption patterns, globalization and climate change.

In this paper, a conceptual research approach is presented to analyse the complexity of the climate change and globalization challenge on the fresh produce supply chain taken as a case study. The factors which affect the vulnerability of the fresh produce chain demand a multidisciplinary research approach. The proposed knowledge-based modelling system is believed to be a most appropriate way to identify problems and to offer solutions to monitor and prevent <b>microbiological</b> food safety <b>risks</b> during all phases of food production and supply. To explore the potential impact of climate change and globalization, baseline information can be obtained by surveillance and performance measurement of implemented food safety management systems.

They are the basis for elaboration of risk assessment studies to scientifically support management options and decisions to new microbiological threats related to globalization and climate change in the fresh produce supply chain. This research concept as such will contribute to develop strategies in order to guarantee the (microbiological) food safety of fresh produce on the long ter...|$|R
