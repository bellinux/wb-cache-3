Taborn {{went on to}} play with numerous other musicians in electronic and acoustic settings, while also building {{a reputation as a}} solo pianist. He has a range of styles, and often adapts his playing {{to the nature of the}} instrument and the sounds that he can make it produce. His improvising, particularly for solo piano, often adopts a <b>modular</b> <b>approach,</b> in which he begins with small units of melody and rhythm and then develops them into larger forms and structures.|$|E

25|$|On {{the flight}} home, Musk {{realized}} that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed. According to early Tesla and SpaceX investor Steve Jurvetson, Musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket actually were only 3 percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time. By applying vertical integration, producing around 85% of launch hardware in-house, and the <b>modular</b> <b>approach</b> from software engineering, SpaceX could cut launch price {{by a factor of}} ten and still enjoy a 70 percent gross margin. SpaceX started with the smallest useful orbital rocket, instead of building a more complex and riskier launch vehicle, which could have failed and bankrupted the company.|$|E

30|$|<b>Modular</b> <b>approaches</b> {{have also}} been proposed, whereby the {{protocol}} stack is divided into different modules which can be combined to create new network protocols with different functionalities. As such, these approaches can easily integrate new network technologies by updating a single module. Modular frameworks, such as SNA [33], {{can be used to}} design new network layers. However, most existing modular frameworks compile these distinct modules into a static network layer. In addition, current <b>modular</b> <b>approaches</b> do not focus on supporting connectivity in heterogeneous environments. Thus, although promising, existing <b>modular</b> <b>approaches</b> offer no additional run-time flexibility when compared to traditional layered approaches. In contrast, the NewArch project [34] discusses how a flexible internet architecture can be created whereby different roles can dynamically be combined at run-time to form 'heaps' [35] which can be adapted {{to the needs of the}} network. Unfortunately, the project did not result in a practical proof-of-concept implementation.|$|R
25|$|Reima Pietilä {{had also}} {{been active in the}} {{activities}} of the Museum of Finnish Architecture as well as publishing theoretical articles in Le Carré Bleu and Arkkitehti. Pietilä even attended a meeting of the Team X group of architects, held in 1972 at Cornell University in the USA, who were very much concerned with questions of structuralism in architecture, that is emphasising the elements of culture, somewhat in reaction to the universalising tendencies of modernism, especially as originally promoted by Team X's instigators, the older generation of CIAM. Pietilä took a diametric viewpoint to that of the rationalist school, and though the works (designed in partnership with his wife Raili Pietilä) had much of the organic idiosyncrasies of Aalto, they were far more abstract and nebulous. In arguing that nature is the apotheosis of plasticity, he demanded a morphological analysis of architectural products, considering Euclidean geometry as an inadequate instrument of analysis. His first major work, the Finnish Pavilion at the 1958 Brussels Expo did in fact take a <b>modular</b> <b>approach</b> akin to the theories of Blomstedt; however, the wooden rectangular box-like units as a whole gave a foretaste of Pietilä's later surfaces based entirely on free form; the most notable of these organic works being Kaleva Church, Tampere (1959–66), Dipoli student assembly building, Espoo (1961–66), Metso Library, Tampere (1978–86) and culminating in his final work, the Official Residence of the President of Finland, Mäntyniemi, Helsinki (1983–93). All these buildings had been the result of open architectural competitions.|$|E

This time round, the design team were able to use injection moulding, which enabled them to deliver a higher-quality case.

This was the same <b>modular</b> <b>approach</b> used during the sessions for Smile and Smiley Smile. To mask each tape edit, vast reverb decays were added at the mixing and sub-mixing stages.|$|E

500|$|Taborn's {{range of}} playing styles was {{summarized}} by Mike Hobart in The Financial Times: Taborn [...] "draws obliquely on the jazz tradition [...] {{he is as}} at home in free improvisation as he is in composition". In an interview for Down Beat in 2011, Taborn described his improvising style, particularly for solo piano. When playing, he often adopts a <b>modular</b> <b>approach,</b> using small units of melody and rhythm and then developing them. This can begin from as little as three notes, with structure being built around referring back to elements of the units. He starts simply, using basic elements such as major and minor thirds, varies them in turn, and then continues to expand to create larger structures. He uses a combination of his attack and the piano's sustain pedal {{to draw attention to}} the upper partials of a note; this allows a heightened contrast between notes to be perceived.|$|E
500|$|Chrono Trigger {{garnered}} much critical praise {{in addition}} to its brisk sales. Famicom Tsūshin gave Chrono Trigger first an 8 out of 10 and later a 9 out of 10 in their Reader Cross Review. Nintendo Power compared it favorably with Secret of Mana, Final Fantasy, and , citing improved graphics, sound, story and gameplay over past RPG titles. GamePro praised the varied gameplay, the humor, the ability to replay the game with previously built-up characters, and the graphics, which they said far exceed even those of Final Fantasy VI. They commented that combat is easier and more simplistic than in most RPGs, but argued that [...] "Most players would choose an easier RPG of this caliber over a hundred more complicated, but less developed, fantasy role-playing adventures." [...] They gave the game a perfect 5 out of 5 in all four categories: graphics, sound, control, and funfactor. Chrono Trigger won multiple awards from Electronic Gaming Monthlys 1995 video game awards, including Best Role-Playing Game, Best Music in a Cartridge-Based Game, and Best Super NES Game. Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine described Trigger as [...] "original and extremely captivating", singling out its graphics, sound and story as particularly impressive. IGN commented that [...] "it may be filled with every imaginable console RPG cliché, but Chrono Trigger manages to stand out among the pack" [...] with [...] "a [...] story that doesn't take itself too serious [...] " [...] and [...] "one of the best videogame soundtracks ever produced". Other reviewers (such as the staff of RPGFan and RPGamer) have criticized the game's short length and relative ease compared to its peers. Victoria Earl of Gamasutra praised the game design for balancing [...] "developer control with player freedom using designed mechanics and a <b>modular</b> <b>approach</b> to narrative." ...|$|E

40|$|Two broad {{classes of}} robot {{controllers}} are the modular, {{and the model}} based <b>approaches.</b> The <b>modular</b> <b>approaches</b> include the Reactive or Behavior Based designs. They do not rely on mathematical system models, but are easy to design, modify and extend. In the model based approaches, a model is used to design a single controller with verifiable system properties. The resulting designs are however often hard to extend, without jeopardizing the previously proven properties. This paper describes an attempt to narrow {{the gap between the}} flexibility of the <b>modular</b> <b>approaches,</b> and the predictability of the model based approaches, by proposing a modular design that does the combination, or arbitration, of the different modules in a model based way. By taking the (model based) time derivatives of scalar, Lyapunov-like, objective functions into account, the arbitration module can keep track of the time evolution of the objectives. This enables it to handle objective tradeoffs in a predictable way by finding controls that preserve an important objective that is currently met, while striving to satisfy another, less important one that is not yet achieved. To illustrate the approach a UAV control problem from the literature is solved, resulting in comparable, or better, performance. QC 20120109 </p...|$|R
