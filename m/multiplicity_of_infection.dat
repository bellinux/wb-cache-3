40|$|AbstractObjectivesNon–small cell lung cancers {{commonly}} develop {{resistance to}} radiation and chemotherapy, {{and they often}} present at stages beyond surgical resectability. Because current treatment modalities are inadequate, novel therapies are necessary to reduce {{the effects of the}} increasing incidence in pulmonary neoplasms. Fas-associating death domain protein is a central mediator of death receptor–initiated apoptosis that directly activates the caspase- 8 protease. We hypothesized that overexpression of Fas-associating death domain protein would effectively eradicate lung cancer cells by induction of apoptosis. MethodsCultured A 549 alveolar carcinoma and NCI-H 226 squamous carcinoma cells were exposed to increasing <b>multiplicities</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> <b>of</b> a replication-deficient, adenoviral vector that expresses the wild-type murine Fas-associating death domain protein gene or control virus for 4 hours. Twenty-four hours later, cells were assessed for viability by crystal violet staining and caspase activation by microscopic analysis. Protein lysates were examined by Western blotting for expression of Fas-associating death domain protein and activated caspase- 8. ResultsAdenoviral infection with the wild-type murine Fas-associating death domain protein gene in A 549 cells resulted in a dose-dependent expression of Fas-associating death domain protein and the appearance of cleaved, activated caspase- 8. Increasing <b>multiplicities</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> <b>of</b> the wild-type murine Fas-associating death domain protein gene, but not control adenovirus, was associated with increased cell death in A 549 and NCI-H 226 cells. The wild-type murine Fas-associating death domain protein gene <b>infection</b> <b>of</b> A 549 cells at <b>multiplicities</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> <b>of</b> 50 induced at least 10 -fold increase in Fas-associating death domain protein levels and decreased viability by > 50 % (n = 3; P <. 001). ConclusionOverexpression of Fas-associating death domain protein induced dose-dependent cell death in A 549 and NCI-H 226 lung epithelial cancer cells. Expression of Fas-associating death domain protein results in activation of caspases, a hallmark of apoptosis. Delivery of the wild-type murine Fas-associating death domain protein gene to drug- and radiation-resistant lung cancer may be a novel method for therapy of non-small cell lung cancer...|$|R
50|$|CPEs are {{important}} aspects of a viral infection in diagnostics. Many CPEs {{can be seen in}} unfixed, unstained cells under the low power of an optical microscope, with the condenser down and the iris diaphragm partly closed. However, with some CPEs, namely inclusion bodies, the cells must be fixed and stained then viewed under light microscopy. Some viruses’ CPEs are characteristic and therefore can be an important tool for virologists in diagnosing an infected animal or human. The rate of CPE appearance is also an important characteristic that virologists may use to identify virus type. If CPE appears after 4 to 5 days in vitro at low <b>multiplicity</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection,</b> then the virus is considered slow. If the CPE appears after 1 to 2 days in vitro at low <b>multiplicity</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection,</b> then the virus is thought to be rapid.

Crosses between markers at the extremities of the map show that there is no increase in recombination frequency under restriction conditions. An examination of phage T 1 heterozygotes suggests that an increase of ends created by the process of P 1 restriction increases recombination. When T 1 crosses are done in the absence of host restriction, recombination defects in the host have no effect on phage recombination and we conclude that phage T 1 codes for its own recombination genes.

It is utilized in both research and development (R&D) in commercial and academic laboratories as well as production situations where the quantity of virus at various steps is an important variable. For example, the production of viral vaccines, recombinant proteins using viral vectors and viral antigens all require virus quantification to continually adapt and monitor the process in order to optimize production yields and respond to ever changing demands and applications. Examples of specific instances where known viruses need to be quantified include clone screening, <b>multiplicity</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> (MOI) optimization and adaptation of methods to cell culture. This page discusses various techniques currently used to quantify viruses in liquid samples. These methods are separated into two categories, traditional vs. modern methods. Traditional methods are industry-standard methods that have been used for decades but are generally slow and labor-intensive. Modern methods are relatively new commercially available products and kits that greatly reduce quantification time. This is not meant to be an exhaustive review of all potential methods, but rather a representative cross-section of traditional methods and new, commercially available methods. While other published methods may exist for virus quantification, non-commercial methods are not discussed here.|$|E

Coincident with the onset of adenovirus DNA replication in coinfected monkey cells, however, there was a marked inhibition of SV 40 DNA replication. Since this inhibition in SV 40 DNA synthesis occurred in the presence of normal SV 40 transcription and protein synthesis, we suggest that adenovirus competes with SV 40 for molecules specifically required for DNA synthesis (e. g., SV 40 T-antigen). At high <b>multiplicities</b> <b>of</b> adenovirus <b>infection</b> (50 PFU/cell), adenoviruses could grow efficiently in monkey kidney cells.

K 1, Mad 20 and RO 33 allelic family of msp- 1 gene were determined by nested PCR amplification.

The persistent state was characterized by cycles of repopulation with a low ratio of infected cells and cycles of extensive cytopathic changes in which greater than 90 % of the cells had chlamydial inclusions and which could be delayed or even terminated by penicillin treatment. Immunofluorescence and superinfection during the period of repopulation revealed that the persistently infected cells could adsorb chlamydiae but their multiplication was arrested.

However, two defective P 22 Tc- 10 particles can cooperate with each other for growth or for lysogeny (i. e., transduction of tetR). “Wild-type ” phages which can grow on single infection and which no longer transduce tetR can be found at a frequency of 5 X 10 -j PFUjparticle in the HFT lysate. Five percent of these “wild-type ” phages are also integration deficient. At high <b>multiplicities</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> the teta transductants made with an HFT lysate appear to be similar to a P 22 Tc- 10 lysogen (i. e., they are immune to P 22 and yield HFT Iysates upon induction); at low <b>multiplicities</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection,</b> many <b>of</b> the tetR transductants are tetR P 22 prophage deletions. To account for these observat’ions, a model is proposed in which the genes for tet” are inserted into the intact P 22 genome in the P 22 Tc- 10 prophage. The consequence...|$|R
