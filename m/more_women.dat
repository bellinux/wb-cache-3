60|$|Somehow Miss Power {{seemed not}} only <b>more</b> <b>woman</b> than Miss De Stancy, but <b>more</b> <b>woman</b> than Somerset was man; {{and yet in}} years she was {{inferior}} to both. Though becomingly girlish and modest, she appeared to possess {{a good deal of}} composure, which was well expressed by the shaded light of her eyes.|$|R

5|$|According to {{a recent}} survey, the ONA has more female {{supporters}} than either the Church of Satan or the Temple of Set; <b>more</b> <b>women</b> with children; more older supporters; more supporters who are better established in socio-economic terms; and more who politically are further to the Right.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the latest}} census, Cameroon still has {{slightly}} <b>more</b> <b>women</b> (50.6%) than men (49.4%). A {{little more than half}} of the population is under 17.7 years of age and the 15 and under population is 43.6%. People over 60 years of age account for only 5.5% of the total population.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Dalton felt {{jealous of}} boys {{for the freedom}} they enjoyed. They could travel alone without {{worrying}} about their reputation and were often bribed to attend school, while girls were, in her opinion, educated reluctantly. One of her teachers {{thought it would be}} wasteful for her to study algebra, as she already had sufficient education for a housewife. As a young woman, she felt that women lived on a higher moral level than men. She saw polygamy as a way to allow <b>more</b> <b>women</b> to marry the few good men, arguing that it gave <b>more</b> <b>women</b> the opportunity to marry. She also considered it ironic that prostitution was tolerated but polygamy was considered depraved.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: It {{is argued}} that, while men may be intrasexually <b>more</b> {{competitive}} than <b>women,</b> to attract potential mates, men will, <b>more</b> than <b>women,</b> associate with same-sex {{friends who are}} attractive to the opposite sex. Therefore, <b>more</b> than <b>women,</b> men will choose more physically attractive and dominant companions in a mating context than in a neutral context...|$|R
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 5 October, a young woman struck a marching drum {{at the edge of}} a group of market-women who were infuriated by the chronic {{shortage}} and high price of bread. From their starting point in the markets of the eastern section of Paris then known as the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, the angry women forced a nearby church to toll its bells. Their numbers continued to grow and with restless energy the group began to march. <b>More</b> <b>women</b> from other nearby marketplaces joined in, many bearing kitchen blades and other makeshift weapons, as the tocsins rang from church towers throughout several districts. Driven by a variety of agitators, the mob converged on the Hôtel de Ville where they demanded not only bread, but arms. As more and <b>more</b> <b>women</b> – and men – arrived, the crowd outside the city hall reached between six and seven thousand, and perhaps as many as ten thousand.|$|E
5|$|Among Jones' other accomplishments {{were the}} passage of a {{mandatory}} seat belt law, an increase in funding for the state park system, and the phasing out of the state inheritance tax. He also established the state's largest-ever reserve trust fund using income from the state's sales, income, corporate, coal, severance, and property taxes. He exceeded his goal of having a 7.4percent minority representation in the state workforce, and appointed three times more African-Americans than the previous administration had recruited. He also appointed <b>more</b> <b>women</b> to government positions than his predecessor, including Sara Combs, the first woman to serve on the Kentucky Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|He next {{went down}} to the first-floor cafeteria, in which about a hundred people were gathered. The crowd {{scattered}} after he shot a woman standing near the kitchens and wounded another student. Entering an unlocked storage area {{at the end of the}} cafeteria, Lépine shot and killed two <b>more</b> <b>women</b> hiding there. He told a male and female student to come out from under a table; they complied and were not shot.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to desegregating public schools, Nixon implemented the Philadelphia Plan in 1970—the first significant federal affirmative action program. He also endorsed the Equal Rights Amendment after it passed {{both houses of}} Congress in 1972 {{and went to the}} states for ratification. Nixon had campaigned as an ERA supporter in 1968, though feminists criticized him for doing little to help the ERA or their cause after his election. Nevertheless, he appointed <b>more</b> <b>women</b> to administration positions than Lyndon Johnson had.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{infertility}} affects 1.5 million couples. Many couples seek assisted reproductive technology (ART) for infertility. In the United States in 2010, 147,260 {{in vitro}} fertilization (IVF) procedures were carried out, with 47,090 live births resulting. In 2013 these numbers had increased to 160,521 and 53,252. However, about a half of IVF pregnancies result in multiple-birth deliveries, which in turn are associated {{with an increase in}} both morbidity and mortality of the mother and the infant. Causes for this include increased maternal blood pressure, premature birth and low birth weight. In addition, <b>more</b> <b>women</b> are waiting longer to conceive and seeking ART.|$|E
5|$|In the {{developing}} world, birth control increases economic growth due to there being fewer dependent children and thus <b>more</b> <b>women</b> {{participating in the}} workforce. Women's earnings, assets, body mass index, and their children's schooling and body mass index all improve with greater access to birth control. Family planning via the use of modern birth control {{is one of the}} most cost-effective health interventions. For every dollar spent, the United Nations estimates that two to six dollars are saved. These cost savings are related to preventing unplanned pregnancies and decreasing the spread of sexually transmitted illnesses. While all methods are beneficial financially, the use of copper IUDs resulted in the greatest savings.|$|E
50|$|However, men did surpass {{women in}} three {{activities}} with children. Contrary to popular belief, men {{were found to}} actually teach kids lessons or read to them <b>more</b> than <b>women.</b> The data showed a significant 41% for men and only 14% for women. Men were also found to be eating with children <b>more</b> than <b>women</b> in commercials.|$|R

40|$|It {{may seem}} that booty calls serve men <b>more</b> so than <b>women.</b> After all, men desire sex <b>more</b> than <b>women</b> – a notion often rationalised by the lower {{biological}} cost of sex to men, compared to women. However, if booty calls favour men <b>more</b> than <b>women,</b> why might women {{be inclined to}} entertain calls for casual sex? Psychology professor Norman Li believes that booty calls should be looked upon as more than just sex; that it is, in fact, a strategy employed by both sexes in negotiating between their needs...|$|R
5|$|The Grameen Bank {{encourages}} {{its members}} to create a positive impact by becoming {{actively involved in the}} politics of their country. According to Muhammad Yunus's book, Banker to the Poor, Yunus commissioned his bank staff to encourage Grameen borrowers to vote; however, the staff were not to influence the voters' decisions on which political party to support. While all Grameen groups are required to exhibit a form of democracy (such as electing a chairperson and secretary), the Grameen staff were surprised to find that borrowers were thrilled with the opportunity to display their voting rights as citizens of Bangladesh in the 1991 national election. The work of the Grameen staff initiated a sharp increase in political activity which continued into the 1992, 1996, and 1997 elections. Since the Grameen Bank caters to women, the 1996 elections received <b>more</b> <b>women</b> voting than men, which led to the removal of political parties opposing women's rights. Not only did <b>more</b> <b>women</b> participate in political activism, but over 1,750 Grameen members, 268 male and 1,485 female, were elected to local offices in 1997.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} policies adopted by Chamorro feminized Nicaragua's labor force. While men's employment rate between 1977 and 1985 remained constant at 68%, women's employment {{outside the home}} in Nicaragua steadily increased {{during the same time}} frame with no reduction in the expectations of simultaneous work within the home. Women's participation in the labor market increased from 26.7% in 1977 to 32% in 1985 and by 1995 was at 36%, one of the highest participation rates in Central America. Though Chamorro's policies changed the nature of the formal work force by introducing <b>more</b> <b>women,</b> the policies did not result in corresponding income increases: wages remained stagnant and changed little over the decade.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{prevailing}} Soviet ideology stressed gender equality in labor and education, and many Soviet women held jobs and advanced degrees, {{they did not}} participate in core political roles and institutions. Above the middle levels, political and economic leaders were overwhelmingly male. While propaganda claimed, accurately, that <b>more</b> <b>women</b> sat in the Supreme Soviet than in most democratic countries' legislative bodies combined, only two women, Yekaterina Furtseva and (in its last year of existence) Galina Semyonova, were ever members of the party's Politburo, in practice the country's real leadership.|$|E
50|$|<b>More</b> {{men than}} <b>women</b> {{typically}} develop hypokinesia, which {{is reflected in}} young and middle-aged populations where females have displayed higher levels of nigrostriatal dopamine than males. In the elderly, however, this differentiation is not present. Typically, <b>women</b> exhibit <b>more</b> tremor in the beginning development of hypokinesia. In the disorder, men tend to display <b>more</b> rigidity and <b>women</b> <b>more</b> bradykinesic motor behavior.|$|R
5000|$|Ex-con Lonnie (Ivan Dixon) is {{the foreman}} {{of the car}} wash who tries to mentor Abdullah while {{struggling}} to raise two young children and fend off his parole officer (Jason Bernard). Abdullah confronts Lindy (Antonio Fargas) and sharply criticizes his cross-dressing, to which Lindy coolly replies, [...] "I'm more man than you'll ever be and <b>more</b> <b>woman</b> than you'll ever get".|$|R
50|$|Studies {{have shown}} a slight {{discrepancy}} in males' and females' use of the self-serving bias. In self-report surveys investigating partner interactions of romantic couples, men tended to attribute negative interactions to their partners <b>more</b> than <b>women</b> did. This is evidence that men may exhibit the self-serving bias <b>more</b> than <b>women,</b> although {{the study did not}} look at positive interaction attributions.|$|R
5|$|Unemployment peaked above 10percent in 1991 and 1992, {{before falling}} {{to a record}} low of 3.7percent in 2007 (ranking third from twenty-seven {{comparable}} OECD nations). Unemployment rose back to 7percent in late 2009. In the June 2017 quarter, unemployment had fallen to 4.8percent. This is the lowest unemployment rate since December 2008, {{after the start of}} the global financial crisis, when it was 4.4 percent. Most New Zealanders do some form of voluntary work, <b>more</b> <b>women</b> volunteer (92 percent) than males (86 percent). Home ownership has declined since 1991, from 73.8percent to 66.9percent in 2006.|$|E
5|$|About 222million {{women who}} want to avoid {{pregnancy}} in developing countries are not using a modern birth control method. Birth control use in developing countries has decreased the number of deaths during or around the time of pregnancy by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% if the full demand for birth control were met. By lengthening the time between pregnancies, birth control can improve adult women's delivery outcomes and the survival of their children. In the developing world women's earnings, assets, weight, and their children's schooling and health all improve with greater access to birth control. Birth control increases economic growth because of fewer dependent children, <b>more</b> <b>women</b> participating in the workforce, and less use of scarce resources.|$|E
5|$|Aruba is a {{small island}} colony of 100,000 people {{that is part of}} the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and has been under Dutch control since the 1630s. The island lies in the {{southern}} Caribbean Sea just to north of Venezuela, and is near to the Dutch colonies of Curaçao and Bonaire. The colony originally was part of an autonomous union with those two islands in what was known as the Netherlands Antilles, but Aruba seceded from that union in 1986. The Netherlands continues to regulate all its foreign affairs. While the first Dutch Antilean delegation to the Olympics was sent during the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland, the first uniquely Aruban delegation participated two years after the island's secession from the Netherlands Antilles at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. Between then and the 2004 Athens Olympics, Aruba had sent a delegation to all five Summer Olympic games. The most substantial Aruban delegation was in 1988, when it included eight athletes. This delegation included <b>more</b> <b>women</b> and encompassed more sports than any Aruban delegation since then (including the Athens Olympics).|$|E
5000|$|Womb envy {{denotes the}} envy men may feel towards a woman's role in {{nurturing}} and sustaining life. In coining the term, the Neo-Freudian psychiatrist Karen Horney (1885-1952) proposed that men experience womb envy <b>more</b> powerfully than <b>women</b> experience penis envy, because [...] "men need to disparage <b>women</b> <b>more</b> than <b>women</b> need to disparage men." [...] As a psychoanalyst, Horney considered womb envy a cultural, psychosocial tendency, like {{the concept of}} penis envy, rather than an innate male psychological trait.|$|R
