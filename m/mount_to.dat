5|$|Sindhu {{was given}} the ever-full bowl of amrita (elixir of life) as a boon from the Sun-god. The demon was warned that he could drink from the bowl {{as long as it}} was intact. So to protect the bowl, he {{swallowed}} it. Sindhu terrorized the three worlds, so the gods asked Gunesha for help. Gunesha defeated Sindhu's army, cut his general Kamalasura into three pieces and then cut open Sindhu's body, emptying the amrita bowl and thus killing the demon. The creator-god Brahma is described as having built the Morgaon shrine, and marrying Siddhi and Buddhi to Ganesha. At the end of this incarnation, Gunesha returned to his celestial abode, giving his peacock <b>mount</b> <b>to</b> his younger brother Skanda, with whom the peacock mount is generally associated.|$|E
5|$|Techniques to {{preserve}} birds were attempted {{even from the}} early 16th century {{as shown in the}} writings of Conrad Gesner and Pierre Belon. Belon provided instructions on the removal of viscera and the use of salt {{to preserve}} bird specimens in his 1555 book on birds. These were further improved in the 17th century and a range of preservatives included ash (potassium carbonate), salt, sulphur, alum, alcohol and various plant extracts were used. In the early days of bird collections, most specimens were mounted in unrealistic positions often with their wings raised as if they were about to take flight. These were kept in the open and the colours were prone to fading and the specimens themselves prone to damage by beetles. In Berlin, J. L. Frisch started using tightly enclosed glass jars for every <b>mount</b> <b>to</b> prevent pest damage. During this time, Comte de Reaumur at the Paris Museum had managed to find techniques to preserve specimens dry and without loss of colour. This technique was however a secret and similar results were later achieved by pickling using salt, ground pepper and alum and drying for a month with threads holding the bird in a natural position. The use of arsenic to preserve specimens was first introduced by Jean-Baptiste Bécoeur (1718-1777) but this method was publicly revealed only in 1800 by Louis Dufresne in Daudin's Traité Élémentaire et Complet d’Ornithologie (1800). In modern collections, salvaged or collected birds may be preserved in a number of ways. The most traditional preparation is a study skin, in which almost all of the body inside the skin is removed and replaced with cotton so that the final result resembles a bird lying on its back with its wings folded. Borax is used as the preferred preservative as it is low in toxicity. This stereotypic posture was developed to enable many skins to be kept together in cabinets to protect them from insect and light damage. If a complete skeleton is desired, a flat skin may be prepared: all bones, muscle, digestive and other soft tissue is carefully removed and the feathers and skin are stretched flat and dried.|$|E

25|$|On July 3, 1898, the U.S. Navy {{destroyed}} the Spanish fleet at Santiago, Cuba, {{and for all}} practical purposes the Spanish–American War was over. The mines were removed from the Potomac River, and later that year the 10-inch gun mounted near Battery Humphreys was moved to a new <b>mount</b> <b>to</b> test a wood and iron parapet that had been built shortly before the outbreak of war. In June 1899, {{what became known as the}} Alger test was conducted by firing one of these guns into a parapet designed by the secretary of war. The results of the test concluded that concrete provided a more effective barrier against rifled artillery than any other design then available to engineers.|$|E
25|$|Testing of {{the first}} B-25 Mitchell armed with 75mm cannon was {{completed}} by the Air Proving Ground Command on 26 March 1943. It had first flown 2 October 1942. B-25C-1, 41-13296, c/n 82-5931, the final airframe of the -1 production block, was modified as the XB-25G prototype, fitted with a 75-mm M4 cannon which was 9 feet 6 inches long. The transparent nose was replaced with a shortened armored solid nose that reduced overall length to 51 feet. The cannon was mounted in a cradle in the lower left-hand side of the nose, which extended underneath the pilot's seat with a spring mechanism forming part of the gun <b>mount</b> <b>to</b> take up the 21-inch recoil. The cannon-armed Mitchell would enjoy success in the Southwest Pacific theatre.|$|E
25|$|While most fighters utilize ground-and-pound statically, by way {{of holding}} their opponents down and mauling them with short strikes from the top position, a few fighters manage to utilize it {{dynamically}} by striking their opponents while changing positions, thus not allowing their opponents to settle once they take them down. Cain Velasquez {{is one of the}} most devastating ground strikers in MMA. He attacks his opponents on the ground while transitioning between positions. Whether he's moving from <b>mount</b> <b>to</b> back mount or from turtle to side control, he is constantly landing shots. Fedor Emelianenko, considered the greatest master of ground-and-pound in MMA history, was the first to demonstrate this dynamic style of striking in transition. He was striking his opponents on the ground while passing guard or while his opponents were attempting to recover guard.|$|E
