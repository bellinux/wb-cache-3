All SAT verbal sections after 1941 were equated to previous tests so that the same scores on different SATs would be comparable. Similarly, in June 1942 the SAT math section was equated to the April 1942 math section, which itself was linked to the 1942 SAT verbal section, and all SAT math sections after 1942 would be equated to previous tests. From this point forward, SAT <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> could change over time, depending on the average ability of the group taking the test compared to the roughly 10,600 students taking the SAT in April 1941.

But, there is still the need to find out a common assessment instrument for this pathology. Methods:The study included 120 patients (40 patients with RA, 40 patients with AS, 20 patients with PsA and 20 patients with SLE).
