40|$|Abstract Background Knee flexion contractures {{have been}} {{associated}} with increased pain and a reduced ability to perform activities of daily living. Contractures can be treated either surgically or conservatively, but these treatment options may not be as successful with worker's compensation patients. The purposes of retrospective review were to 1) determine the efficacy of using adjunctive high-intensity stretch (HIS) <b>mechanical</b> <b>therapy</b> to treat flexion contractures, and 2) compare the results between groups of worker's compensation and non-compensation patients. Methods Fifty-six patients (19 women, 37 men, age = 51. 5 ± 17. 0 years) with flexion contractures were treated with HIS <b>mechanical</b> <b>therapy</b> as an adjunct to outpatient physical <b>therapy.</b> <b>Mechanical</b> <b>therapy</b> was only prescribed for those patients whose motion had reached a plateau when treated with physical therapy alone. Patients were asked to perform six, 10 -minute bouts of end-range stretching per day with the ERMI Knee Extensionater (r) (ERMI, Inc., Atlanta, GA). Passive knee extension was recorded during the postoperative visit that <b>mechanical</b> <b>therapy</b> was prescribed, 3 months after beginning <b>mechanical</b> <b>therapy,</b> and at the most recent follow-up. We used a mixed-model 2 × 3 ANOVA (group × time) to evaluate the change in passive knee extension between groups over time. Results Regardless of group, the use of adjunctive HIS <b>mechanical</b> <b>therapy</b> resulted in passive knee extension deficits that significantly improved from 10. 5 ° ± 5. 2 ° at the initial visit to 2. 6 ° ± 3. 5 ° at the 3 month visit (p Conclusions We conclude that the adjunctive use of HIS <b>mechanical</b> <b>therapy</b> is an effective treatment option for patients with knee flexion contractures, regardless of whether the patient is being treated as part of a worker's compensation claim or not. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{frequency}} of gingival and periodontal disease in HIV-seropositive and AIDS patients {{was investigated in}} order to evaluate the oral hygiene benefits of using <b>mechanical</b> <b>therapy.</b> Study design: thirty-two consenting HIV-positive patients were examined. Their gingival and periodontal status were evaluated using the Gingival Index and the Simplified Oral Hygiene Index. The data were assessed at baseline, after three months and after six months. Subjects received <b>mechanical</b> <b>therapy,</b> which included calculus removal, scaling and root planning, tooth polishing and oral hygiene instructions. The maintenance of oral hygiene was performed weekly. HIV staging and CD 4 counts were also investigated. Results: At the baseline, gingival and periodontal disease was present in 71. 9 % of all subjects. Chronic gingivitis (43. 8 %) was the most frequent in all subjects. A clear improvement in gingival health was registered in 78. 2 % of subjects {{after six months of}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>therapy.</b> No association was registered between CD 4 count and gingival/periodontal status or attachment loss with HIV staging. Conclusions: Chronic gingivitis was the most frequent disease in HIV infected and AIDS patients.

40|$|Mechanical {{force is}} tightly {{connected}} {{to human health}} status, and the occurrence of disease can generally be ascribed to certain loss of force balance. However, the role of mechanical approaches in tumor therapy is largely neglected, while the currently available cancer prevention and treatment methods are generally either expensive or just cause too much side effect. In this article, we present a systematic interpretation on a promising strategy which was termed here as <b>Mechanical</b> <b>Therapy</b> {{for the first time}} {{based on the fact that}} mechanical force closely accompanies the whole life (growth and death) of a cell, and plays a crucial role in biological functions. In order to mold the mechanical force as a practical tool for cancer therapy, we expound the effects of the mechanical force related to the tumors from molecule to tissue level and evaluate its feasibility for treatment purpose. It can be conceived that given enough investigations, the <b>mechanical</b> <b>therapy</b> may generate big potential to open new windows for cancer prevention, relieving or even destroying if well administrated. As an easy going and convenient method, a systematic and thorough study of <b>mechanical</b> <b>therapy</b> may clarify more options for future clinical practices. Besides, when patients encounter various forces in daily life, they can at least identify the good or bad forces for a better and healthy life style based on the mechanisms thus disclosed...|$|R
