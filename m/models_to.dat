40|$|Summary: We propose {{an online}} binary {{classification}} procedure for cases {{when there is}} uncertainty about the <b>model</b> <b>to</b> use and when parameters within a model change over time. We account for model uncertainty through Dynamic Model Averaging (DMA), a dynamic extension of Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) in which posterior model probabilities are also allowed to change with time. We do this by applying a state-space <b>model</b> <b>to</b> the parameters of each model and a Markov chain <b>model</b> <b>to</b> the data-generating <b>model,</b> allowing the “correct ” <b>model</b> <b>to</b> change over time.

In early October 1945, Sinnock submitted <b>models</b> <b>to</b> Assistant Director of the Mint F. Leland Howard (then acting as director), who transmitted them to the Commission of Fine Arts. This commission reviews coin designs because it was tasked by a 1921 executive order by President Warren G. Harding with rendering advisory opinions on public artworks.|$|E
