This class of compound represents the initial metabolites and environmental degradants of the nerve agents: VX, rVX (Russian VX), GB (Sarin), GF (Cyclosarin), and GD (Soman). Compared with the post-column addition of the mobile phase, the post-column addition of aprotic solvents and longer chain alcohols enhance the signal intensity and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the chromatographic peaks by factors of up to 60 and 19, respectively. The post-column addition of water, methanol, and ethanol resulted in little or no relative signal enhancement. It is proposed that the post-column addition of these solvents do not result in the same enhancements due to stabilization of analyte solvation through hydrogen bonding...|$|R
40|$|AbstractVascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) and its receptors {{play a key}} role in angiogenesis. VEGF receptor- 2 (VEGFR- 2) has a {{tyrosine}} kinase domain, and, once activated, induces the phosphorylation of cytoplasmic signaling proteins. The phosphorylated VEGFR- 2 may be a substrate for intracellular protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) which prevent VEGF signaling. We synthesized a series of α,α-difluoro(phenyl) <b>methylphosphonic</b> <b>acids</b> (DFPMPAs) which inhibit the action of PTP. In this study, we test their effects on VEGF-induced angiogenesis. DFPMPA- 3, the most effective inhibitor of human PTP- 1 B, promoted tube formation by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) on Matrigel more effectively than any other DFPMPAs. The inhibitor promoted the VEGF-induced proliferation and migration of HUVEC by inhibiting the dephosphorylation of VEGFR- 2. Its effectiveness was proven through neo-vascularization in mice. The present findings suggest that targeting PTP to promote therapeutic neo-vascularization may be a potential strategy...|$|R

50|$|The most {{important}} chemical reactions of phosphoryl halides is the hydrolysis {{of the bond}} between phosphorus and the fluoride. This P-F bond is easily broken by nucleophilic agents, such as water and hydroxide. At high pH, sarin decomposes rapidly to nontoxic phosphonic acid derivatives. The initial breakdown of sarin is into isopropyl <b>methylphosphonic</b> <b>acid</b> (IMPA), a chemical that is not commonly found in nature except as a breakdown product of sarin (this is useful for detecting the recent deployment of sarin as a weapon). IMPA then degrades into <b>methylphosphonic</b> <b>acid</b> (MPA), which can also be produced by other organophosphates.|$|E

50|$|Soman can be hydrolyzed by a {{so-called}} A-esterase, more specific a diisopropylfluorophosphatase. This esterase, also called somanase, reacts with the anhydride bond between phosphorus and fluorine and {{accounts for the}} hydrolysis of the fluoride.

It reacts with water producing HF fumes and <b>methylphosphonic</b> <b>acid</b> as a result. It is also capable of corroding glass. It has a boiling point of only 55.4 °C at normal atmospheric pressure, {{and thus a}} fairly high vapor pressure at room temperature.|$|E

50|$|Soman {{can also}} bind to other esterases, e.g., AChE, cholinesterase (ChE) and carboxylesterases (CarbE). In this binding, soman loses its fluoride. After binding to AChE or ChE soman also loses its {{phosphoryl}} group, {{leading to the}} formation of <b>methylphosphonic</b> <b>acid</b> (MPA). Binding to CarbE reduce the total concentration of soman in the blood, thus resulting in a lower toxicity. Furthermore, CarbE are involved in the detoxication by hydrolysing soman to PMPA. So CarbE account for the detoxication of soman in two ways.|$|E

The factors influential to extraction: type of organic solvent, type of ion-pair reagent and its concentration, pH values of sample solution and acceptor aqueous phase, stirring rate and extraction time were investigated in detail. After extraction, the drop of the acceptor solution was withdrawn into the syringe and injected into a capillary electrophoresis system for analysis. Using contactless conductivity detection, direct quantification of these compounds is possible. Moreover, large-volume sample injection was employed for further pre-concentration. Improvements in the limits of detection between 2. 5 and 4 orders of magnitude could be achieved and concentrations at the ng/mL level can be determined.

40|$|The {{nerve agent}} sarin (isopropyl methylphosphonofluoridate) {{thermally}} breaks down to form methylphosphonofluoridic acid and propylene. The thermal breakdown of soman (pinacolyl methylphosphonofluoridate) probably forms methylphosphonofluoridic acid as well. Continued high temperature treatment {{such as that}} of an incinerator would continue the breakdown process. In order to prove that no methylphosphonofluoridic acid is produced, an analytical standard is required. Methylphosphonofluoridic acid was produced by disproportionation of methylphosphonic difluoride with <b>methylphosphonic</b> <b>acid.</b> However, to obtain methylphosphonofluoridic acid in high purity, modifications to its preparation were required. First, a suitable laboratory preparation of methylphosphonic difluoride containing as little methylphosphonic dichloride or methylphosphonic chloride fluoride as possible was required. Several modifications to the reaction of methylphosphonic dichloride with sodium fluoride to yield methylphosphonic difluoride were pursued with good results. Ultimately, the reaction of methylphosphonic dichloride with sodium hexafluorosilicate proved to be the most convenient. Using the methylphosphonic difluoride produced in this way, its reaction with <b>methylphosphonic</b> <b>acid</b> required prolonged heating in a sealed tube to produce methylphosphonofluoridic acid...|$|E
40|$|Two {{microplate}} spectroscopic {{methods for}} determination of organophosphates, based on inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity, have been elaborated and evaluated for {{determination of the}} chemical weapon agent soman. The principal difference between the methods is that one measures reaction substrate concentration (elaborated from Hestrin), while the other measures reaction product (elaborated from Ellman). The linear ranges of the two methods {{were found to be}} similar. Although the limit of quantification was lower for the Ellman method (110 pM), the sensitivity coefficient was in favor of the Hestrin method (1. 55 -fold higher). The effects of the main soman hydrolysis products were consistent for the two methods: both <b>methylphosphonic</b> <b>acid</b> and pinacolyl <b>methylphosphonic</b> <b>acid</b> did not inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity. The main components of decontaminating solutions showed differential effects: while monoethanolamine had no influence upon results obtained by either method, hydrogen peroxide interfered with the Ellman method at far lower concentrations than with the Hestrin method. In practical applications involving samples containing hydrogen peroxide, the method based on Hestrin should be regarded as much more specific for OP determination than the Ellman method...|$|E
40|$|Analysis of {{chemical}} warfare agents (CWAs) and their degradation products {{is an important}} verification component {{in support of the}} Chemical Weapons Convention and urgently demanding rapid and reliable analytical methods. A portable microchip electrophoresis (ME) device with contactless conductivity (CCD) detection was developed for the in situ identification of CWA and their degradation products. A 10 mM MES/His, 0. 4 mM CTAB - based separation electrolyte accomplished the analysis of Sarin (GB), Tabun(GA) and Soman (GD) in less than 1 min, which is the fastest screening of nerve agents achieved with portable ME and CCD based detection methods to date. Reproducibility of detection was successfully demonstrated on simultaneous detection of GB (200 ppm) and GA (278 ppm).

40|$|The {{analysis}} of alkyl alkylphosphonic acids, the degradation products of V and G nerve agents as VX, Sarin or Soman, {{is an important}} task for the verification of compliance to the Chemical Weapons Convention. The detection of these contaminants at low concentration levels is often difficult in complex matrices due {{to the amount of}} interfering substances. Molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction technique should allow a selective extraction of these compounds from complex samples, and thus make their detection easier. Two molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) prepared with methacrylic acid (MAA) as monomer and pinacolyl <b>methylphosphonic</b> <b>acid</b> (PMPA) as template molecule were synthesised and tested. The first polymer, MIP A, was prepared with ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) in dichloromethane. The second polymer, MIP B, was synthesised using trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate (TRIM) in acetonitrile. To evaluate the selectivity provided by these MIPs, the retention of the ethyl <b>methylphosphonic</b> <b>acid</b> (EMPA) target molecule was studied in parallel on a non-imprinted polymer (NIP). While MIP A does not show any difference compared to NIP A, a good selectivity was obtained for MIP B. After the optimisation of the extraction process, 60 % of EMPA can be removed from the NIP B without affecting the retention on the MIP B. A recovery of extraction of 93 % was then obtained on the MIP B. Its capacity was then measured and corresponds to 97 μg of EMPA per gram of MIP.
