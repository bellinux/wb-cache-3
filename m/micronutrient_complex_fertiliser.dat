50|$|At {{the core}} of the Group are two {{production}} facilities, Acron (established in 1961) and Dorogobuzh (established in 1966), which at one time formed the basis of the Soviet fertiliser industry. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, both enterprises were privatised, underwent a large-scale revamping and adopted the long-term reconstruction and upgrade programme and consolidated corporate governance system. Early in this decade the Company set a course to develop a vertically integrated business. Today, in addition to its production assets, the Group has its own logistics and distribution networks and is investing in raw material projects. In order to strengthen its hand in the world's largest fertiliser market - China - in 2005 the Group acquired <b>complex</b> <b>fertiliser</b> producer Hongri Acron and created its own extensive distribution network. In August 2016 Hongri Acron plant was sold to a Hong Kong industrial and investment company. In 2011 the company entered a joint venture with Rio Tinto to develop the Albany potash prospect in Saskatchewan, Canada.|$|R

An 8 - 15 - 15 <b>complex</b> <b>fertiliser</b> was also applied for comparison. Five years of ryegrass and three of horticultural plants (tomato and eggplant) were successively cropped during the experiment. Increases of total- and available-P were observed with both organic and inorganic fertilisation. Total-P increased more in soils treated with the highest compost dose. Generally, available-P was similar for soils treated with the highest compost dose and inorganic fertiliser. Also a slight but significant increase of organic-P was found in soils treated with compost. Phosphorus added to soil tends to increase soluble- plus exchangeable-P (more in inorganic fertiliser treatment), P in calcium phosphates (more in highest compost treatment) and residual-P, the latter being greater in soils treated with compost.

40|$|Background: Phosphorus {{recycling}} from {{waste and}} localised placement of fertilisers can potentially improve sustainable P management in agriculture. However, knowledge about root and plant P uptake responses to placement of <b>complex</b> waste-derived <b>fertilisers</b> is lacking. Methods: Sewage sludge (SS) and sewage sludge ash (ASH) were tested against triple superphosphate (TSP) in a rhizobox setup where maize shoot and root growth and architecture were followed for 30 days. The three P sources were either mixed homogenously {{into the soil}} (slightly acidic, low in available P and moderate P fixing capacity; labelled with 33 P) or localised in a patch close to the seed. Results: Localisation of TSP and SS both induced increased root length density {{in and around the}} fertiliser patch. For TSP this was followed by enhanced dry matter yield and fertiliser P uptake compared to the mixed source. In contrast, P uptake from SS was not enhanced by the localisation, and while the uptake from the seed was similar, the uptake from soil was lower probably due to weaker root development in the remaining soil. No root response was found for localised ASH, whereas mixed ASH more than doubled dry matter yield and P uptake in comparison.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In October 2004, Manam Island volcano in Papua New Guinea erupted, causing over 10 000 villagers {{to flee to}} {{internally}} {{displaced person}} (IDP) camps, including 550 from Dugulaba village. Following violence over land access in March 2010, the IDPs fled the camps, and four months later concurrent outbreaks of acute watery diarrhea and unusual neurological complaints were reported in this population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective case-control {{study was conducted to}} identify the risk factors for peripheral neuropathy. Rectal swabs were collected from cases of acute watery diarrhea. Hair and serum metals and metalloids were analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). RESULTS: There were 17 deaths among the 550 village inhabitants during the outbreak period at a crude mortality rate 21 -fold that of a humanitarian crisis. Vibrio cholerae O 1 El Tor Ogawa was confirmed among the population. Access to community-level rehydration was crucial to mortality. Peripheral neuropathy was diagnosed among cases with neurological symptoms. A balanced diet was significantly protective against neuropathy. A dose-response relationship was seen between peripheral neuropathy and a decreasing number of micronutrient- rich foods in the diet. Deficiencies in copper, iron, selenium and zinc were identified among the cases of peripheral neuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: Cholera likely caused the mostly preventable excess mortality. Peripheral neuropathy was not caused by cholera, but cholera may worsen existing nutritional deficiencies. The peripheral neuropathy was likely caused by <b>complex</b> <b>micronutrient</b> deficiencies linked to non-diversified diets that potentially increased the vulnerability of this population, however a new zinc-associated neuropathy could not be ruled out.

40|$|In {{the early}} 90 ’s, {{a new and}} novel means (liquid Flex system) of crop {{fertilisation}} was launched on the Irish market which was capable of supplying the crop’s total nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and trace element requirement in liquid form, formulated to meet specific crop requirements. This system included novel chemistry, untested under Irish conditions and with little specific reference in the scientific literature. The chemistry of the liquid Flex system consists of an acid-based material. Stable compounds i. e. urea sulphate, urea phosphate and urea-metal complexes are formed by the reaction of urea with sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid and metal salts, respectively. Interest in these materials has been generated because they possess a number of physical and chemical characteristics, which, in theory, should be beneficial. However, {{the ability of the}} Flex system to effectively supply nutrients to the plant has not been researched. A field and greenhouse experimental programme was carried out over the three seasons, 1996 - 1998 to compare acid-base/urea-metal <b>complexes</b> with conventional <b>fertilisers</b> and to investigate whether this unconventional chemistry could lead to increased biological efficiency. The trial programme evaluated the Flex system, both as individual components and as a complete fertiliser. In field comparisons, formulation of P as urea phosphate gave similar results to conventional granular superphosphate in terms of grain yield, recovery of P by the crop and grain quality, regardless of soil type. This was supported by the results from the greenhouse experiment. In field comparisons of the main soil-applied liquid Flex source of N, i. e. N 24 (urea {{with the addition of a}} standard level of acid and metal salts) with conventional N formulations, N 24 gave poorer performance than CAN and granular urea in warm dry conditions due to insufficient inhibition to substantially reduce ammonia volatilisation. In wet conditions, the slow release of N from inhibited urea may have reduced the potential loss from leaching or denitrification, and led to a better performance than CAN or urea. The additional product of the Flex system, i. e. liquid Flex urea - N 18 (urea with the addition of metal salts), applied as a foliar spray, was no more efficient than liquid urea as a late N source. The Flex urea had the disadvantage that it gave higher scorch levels than conventional liquid urea. When flag leaf scorch was excessive, grain yield was affected and quality suffered, with reduced grain and hectolitre weights. Where early application of P may have been critical to obtain maximum response, the N that accompanied the early application of P as urea phosphate was most likely lost through leaching. The application of large quantities of K in any one application with the liquid system was restricted due to solubility problems, which ultimately resulted in delayed application in soils with low K levels. The Flex system does not lead to increased biological efficiency. However, as farms get bigger and greater emphasis is placed on the reduction of water and air pollution, the liquid Flex system may become attractive because of its practical advantages in handling, storage and application and the ability to tailor-make specific formulations for given crop requirements.

40|$|Irregular pagination: missing p. 210 New Zealand's {{agricultural}} production systems are {{based largely on}} legume-based pastures which require a high soil phosphorus (P) status to achieve optimum production. Although application of P fertilisers undoubtedly leads to increased {{agricultural production}} and a direct economic benefit to New Zealand, concerns are growing about possible harmful side effects of long-term application of high rates of P fertilisers. These side effects can arise through contaminants contained in the fertilisers and through the direct or indirect effects of the P fertilisers on soil acidity. The general objective {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effect of long-term application of P fertilisers on soil acidity and aluminium (Al) phytotoxicity. Particular emphasis was placed on the possible role of fluoride (F), contained in the fertilisers as a contaminant, on the chemistry and phytotoxicity of soil Al. A field study was carried out to investigate the effects of long-term annual applications of six types of P fertilisers on soil acidity under legume-based pastures. The results from this study indicated that in a marginally acidic soil (pH(H 2 O) 5. 4 - 5. 8), irrespective of the rate or form of P fertiliser used, the soil became increasingly acidic over a period of seven years. However, the rate of acidification varied with the type of P fertiliser used. By year 8, the application of North Carolina phosphate rock (NCPR) gave higher pH, exchangeable Ca and Ca saturation but significantly lowered exchangeable and soluble Al than the control plots. In contrast, diammonium phosphate (DAP) application gave significantly lower soil pH, exchangeable Ca and Ca saturation and increased soluble Al and exchange acidity. In comparison to the control plots, single superphosphate (SSP) in general had similar soil pH and exchangeable Al but increased exchangeable Ca and Ca saturation at higher rates of application. The results suggested that continuous use of certain reactive phosphate rocks such as NCPR can significantly slow down the rate of acidification of pastoral soils. Using the same field trial, changes in soil solution composition and Al speciation were investigated. Application of DAP and high rates of SSP increased total Al concentrations in the soil solution even though SSP had no effect on soil pH. The increased Al concentration in the SSP treatments could be due to high concentrations of F (added as a contaminant in the <b>fertilisers)</b> <b>complexing</b> Al, and hence bringing more Al into the soil solution. Application of NCPR decreased total Al concentrations, presumably by increasing pH. Application of DAP increased the predicted concentrations of toxic Al species- Al 3 +, Al(OH) 2 +, Al(OH) 2 1 +. In contrast application of SSP decreased the toxic Al concentration, despite higher solution Al concentration compared with control treatment. The concentration of toxic Al species in NCPR-treated soil was also lower than in the control treatment. A short-term bioassay was carried out using barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) to study the effects of long-term (20 years) inputs of Ca, F, and sulphate (SO 4) from P fertilisers and changes in soil pH on Al phytotoxicity. Results of this glasshouse experiment showed that the relationships between soil Al indices and barley root growth were different for soils with different P fertiliser history. The inability of total monomeric Al, and 0. 02 M CaCl 2 -extractable Al to explain the variation in root growth in the combined data for fertilised and unfertilised soils indicated that the relative proportions of the phytotoxic Al were different for fertilised and unfertilised soils. These differences were due to the higher proportions of the less-toxic Al-F complexes in the fertilised soil and also due to the high concentrations of Ca in the soil solution. The ability of the activity ratio of Al 3 +/Ca 2 + to predict Al toxicity most consistently across soils with different P fertiliser histories indicated that soil solution Ca should be taken into account together with toxic Al species in the assessment of Al phytotoxicity. A short-term bioassay was carried out to develop a chemical test to predict the potential toxicity of Al for early root growth in widely different soil types. The results from this study showed that, in soils with similar physical properties, mineralogy and low organic matter content, short time pyrocatecol violet (PCV) -Al determination in soil solution can be used as a simple and reliable method to predict Al toxicity. However, the direct use of short-time colorimetric procedures to predict critical Al toxicity levels for different soil types could be limited by the variations in organic Al and other factors such as ionic strength, cation and anion types and concentrations. Among the Al toxicity indices studied, as observed in the trial with similar parent materials, the activity ratio of Al 3 +/Ca 2 + is again the best predictor of Al toxicity but now in widely different soil types. The interactive effects of soil acidity and F were also studied using the short-term bioassay method. Increasing rates of F additions to soil significantly increased the soil solution concentrations of Al and F irrespective of the initial soil pH. However, the rate of increase was much higher at low pH than at high pH. There was a significant interaction between soil acidity and F on root growth of barley. High rates of F addition severely reduced root growth and the effect was more pronounced in the strongly acidic soil. Speciation calculations predicted that increasing rates of F additions increased Al-F complexes in the soil solution. Results also indicated that Al-F complexes are not toxic at lower concentrations but they are toxic at high concentrations and the relative toxicity depended on the type of Al-F complexes present. Results from this study suggest that it is unlikely that in a marginally acidic soil (pH (H 2 O) 5. 4 - 5. 8) long-term F inputs via P fertilisers will have any detrimental effects on plant growth. Rather it will reduce the free Al concentration while keeping the Al-F species concentration below the toxic threshold level in the soil solution, thereby reducing the occurrence of Al phototoxicity...|$|R
