He had come across the film in the 1970s, while clearing a projector testing room at the BBC's Ealing Studios. Instead of disposing of the film as instructed, he brought it home – eventually to return it to the Corporation when he realised the value of the material.|$|E

Written by Reed Cowan and narrated by Dustin Lance Black, the film divided critics over a perceived heavy-handed approach to the church's involvement; it won the 2011 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Documentary. Attention to the Mormon involvement was justified given that, among other non-monetary efforts, Mormons and the <b>Mormon</b> <b>Church</b> spent over $20 million to support the passage of Proposition 8.|$|E

Prior climbs into Heaven and tells the other angels that he refuses to deliver their message, as without progress, humanity will perish.|$|E

25|$|At {{one of the}} {{meetings}} during the reformation Anderson and his step-daughter confessed that they had committed adultery, believing when they did so that Brigham Young {{would allow them to}} marry when he learned the facts. Their confession being full, they were rebaptized and received into full membership. They were then placed under covenant that if they again committed adultery, Anderson should suffer death. Soon after this a charge was laid against Anderson before the Council, accusing him of adultery with his step-daughter...the Council voted that Anderson must die for violating his covenants. Klingensmith went to Anderson and notified him that the orders were that he must die by having his throat cut, so that the running of his blood would atone for his sins. Anderson, being a firm believer in the doctrines and teachings of the <b>Mormon</b> <b>Church,</b> made no objections, but asked for half a day to prepare for death. His request was granted. His wife was ordered to prepare a suit of clean clothing, in which to have her husband buried, and was informed that he was to be killed for his sins, she being directed to tell those who should enquire after her husband that he had gone to California.|$|E
500|$|In a few {{accounts}} of Brannan's {{dealings with the}} LDS church {{it is said that}} Brigham Young sent the apostle Amasa Lyman to collect the tithing money that Brannan had withheld from the church's institution. When Lyman arrived Brannan was unable to account for the tithes that Brigham Young and other Mormons claimed were given to him or that he owed from his own personal income. He reportedly told them, [...] "You go back and tell Brigham Young that I'll give up the Lord's money when he sends me a receipt signed by the Lord", although historians, such as Will Bagley have found this is likely just legend. In another account, Lyman was sent to gather $10,000 of owed tithing from Brannan (or more if he was willing). After a couple of visits all of Brannan's debts to the <b>Mormon</b> <b>church</b> were considered to be paid in full.|$|E

But the movie drops that discussion {{almost as soon as}} it introduces it, in favor of talking about the distress of gay Mormon youths." ...|$|R

Frank Scheck, reviewer for The Hollywood Reporter, wrote: [...] "Cox's screenplay, while occasionally lapsing into the sort of clichés endemic to so many gay-themed films, generally treats its unusual subject matter with dignity and complexity." [...] Film critic Roger Ebert gave it {{two and a half}} stars out of four, declaring that the script was peopled from the [...] "Stock Characters Store" [...] and [...] "the movie could have been (a) a gay love story, or (b) an attack on the <b>Mormon</b> <b>Church,</b> but is an awkward fit by trying to be (c) both at the same time". Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune commented [...] "this movie is often as kitschy and artificial as ... 'Sweet Home Alabama'", another film written by Cox.|$|E

In the United States, the church continues to operate as an unincorporated entity. Accepted informal names for the church include the LDS Church, the Latter-day Saints, and the Mormons. The term <b>Mormon</b> <b>Church</b> is in common use, but the church began discouraging its use in the late 20th century, though takes no issue with the term Mormon itself.

2500|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Utah Territory was heavily {{populated}} by Mormons and dominated religiously and politically by the <b>Mormon</b> <b>Church,</b> which held great sway over Mormons voters. Because {{the vast majority}} of the population was Mormon, people outside of the LDS church had very little political representation. The segregation between Mormons and non-Mormons (at the time called [...] "Gentiles") became very apparent. As a non-Mormon woman there were few ways to meet other women, whereas, the women of the <b>Mormon</b> <b>Church</b> had the Relief Society to build friendships and expend energy. Froiseth struggled with the lack of social engagement. During a visit to family and friends back in New York City in 1875, Froiseth attended the Sorosis Women's club with her sister Julia. The experience Froiseth had at the club motivated her to form a literary club back in Salt Lake City which was organized in 1875 and called the Blue Tea. It was Utah's first women's club. The Blue Tea's first president was Froiseth (1876) who set a cap of 25 members. The Blue Tea discussed many topics for the purpose of stimulating [...] "mental culture" [...] within its members. A few women would be assigned to read a book or article and come back the next week to expound on the ideas they read. Then the club would debate over those ideas. Froiseth described the Blue Tea's first year: [...] "we did good work, had some fine programmes, necessitating not a little reading and study, and the meetings went so well that there was rarely a vacant chair". Froiseth's club gave non-Mormon women the chance to socialize but also empowered them to push for change within their society. The minutes for the Blue Tea can be found in the Special Collections of the Marriott Library, ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the missionaries}} left French Polynesia, church members faced {{harassment}} from some {{government officials and}} members of the Catholic Church. In 1867, general religious toleration was established in Polynesia which eventually led to the return of missionaries in the territory. In 1892, missionaries were able to return to the islands. Joseph W. Damron and William A. Seegmiller were the missionaries who were assigned to return to the islands. They found that many of the members who had joined the church in the mid-1800s had fallen away. Joseph F. Smith, counselor in the First Presidency, called James S. Brown, who was Pratt's mission companion in 1849, to be the new mission president when it reopened. Brown accepted. Upon his arrival to the islands, he discovered that there were some members who had remained faithful but that many had joined the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Eventually, Brown and the missionaries who accompanied him were successful in re-baptizing many Tahitians into the <b>Mormon</b> <b>Church.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Suicide {{attempts}} and ideation {{have been}} experienced by many LGBT Mormons. In a 2015 survey of 92 LGBTQ BYU students done by USGA, 52% had {{at some point}} considered self-harm. Neon Trees lead singer Tyler Glenn stated {{that he was trying}} to reconcile his sexual orientation and belief in the <b>Mormon</b> <b>church</b> when the 5 November 2015 policy change was leaked leading to a feeling that church was a [...] "toxic space" [...] for him generating feelings of suicide. One bisexual BYU student Brenna McGrath stated in 2017 that she was attempting to overdose herself on medication after feeling isolated and that church was a [...] "toxic environment" [...] for her. Alex Cooper, a lesbian Mormon teen who beginning in 2010 was subjected to physically abusive conversion therapy techniques in an attempt to change her sexual orientation, reported attempting suicide. Mormon composer Michael McLean also stated that his gay son was suicidal during the church's California campaign to ban same-sex marriage. Jordan Montgomery discusses his suicidal ideation as well as attempts by an LDS therapist to change his sexual orientation in the 2013 mini-documentary [...] "Families are Forever".|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the end of}} {{the priesthood}} ban in 1978, racist beliefs in the church prevailed. White church member Eugene England, a {{professor}} at Brigham Young University, wrote in 1998 that most Mormons still held deeply racist beliefs, including that blacks were descended from Cain and Ham and subject to their curses. England's students at BYU who reported these beliefs learned them from their parents or from instructors at church, and had little insight into how these beliefs contradicted gospel teachings. In 2003, black LDS Church member Darron Smith noticed a similar problem, and wrote in Sunstone about the persistence of racist beliefs in the LDS church. Smith wrote that racism persisted in the church because church leadership had not addressed the ban's origins. This racism persisted in the beliefs that blacks were descendants of Cain, that they were neutral in the war in heaven, and that skin color was tied to righteousness. In 2007, journalist and church member, Peggy Fletcher Stack, wrote that black Mormons still felt separate from other church members because of how other members treat them, ranging from calling them the [...] "n-word" [...] at church and in the temple to small differences in treatment. The dearth of blacks in <b>Mormon</b> <b>church</b> leadership also contributes to black members' feelings of not belonging.|$|E
2500|$|Arthur Conan Doyle's {{detective novel}} A Study in Scarlet (1887) is another {{portrayal}} that caused controversy. Mormons viewed {{the portrayal of}} the Danites in the book as highly erroneous, being yet another instance of anti-Mormon antagonism in popular media. Conan Doyle, according to his daughter, had relied upon what had been published about Mormons by former Mormons (historians believing these probably to be Fannie Stenhouse, William A. Hickman, William Jarman, John Hyde, and Ann Eliza Young), believing those accounts to be factual. Conan Doyle visited the United States in 1923, and one leg of his lecture tour {{took him to the}} University of Utah, to lecture on spiritualism. During his stay he received a letter from a Dr. G. Hodgson Higgins, who had formed his impressions of Mormonism based upon the portrayal in A Study in Scarlet, which [...] "gave the impression that murder was a common practice among them", and who suggested that Conan Doyle [...] "express his regret at having propagated falsehoods about the <b>Mormon</b> <b>Church</b> and people". Conan Doyle refused to withdraw what he had written about the Danites and the murders, {{on the grounds that it}} was a matter of historical record, but stated that his treatment in the novel was more [...] "lurid" [...] than the treatment by a history textbook would have been, and promised that in the future his portrayals of the Latter-day Saints would be based upon his firsthand experience of them on his visit. Subsequent Mormon characters in Conan Doyle's work were indeed more sympathetic.|$|E
