50|$|A {{compound}} meter is used where {{high flow}} rates are necessary, but where at times {{there are also}} smaller rates of flow {{that need to be}} accurately measured. Compound meters have two <b>measuring</b> <b>elements</b> and a check valve to regulate flow between them. At high flow rates, water is normally diverted primarily or completely to the high flow element. The high flow element is typically a turbine meter. When flow rates drop to where the high flow element cannot measure accurately, a check valve closes to divert water to a smaller element that can measure the lower flow rates accurately. The low flow element is typically a multi-jet or PD meter. By adding the values registered by the high and low elements, the utility has a record of the total consumption of water flowing through the meter.|$|E

40|$|A two axis thrust {{measuring}} system was analyzed {{by using a}} finite a element computer program to determine the sensitivities of the thrust vectoring nozzle system to misalignment of the load cells and applied loads, and the stiffness of the structural members. Three models were evaluated: (1) the basic <b>measuring</b> <b>element</b> and its internal calibration load cells; (2) the basic <b>measuring</b> <b>element</b> and its external load calibration equipment; and (3) the basic <b>measuring</b> <b>element,</b> external calibration load frame and the altitude facility support structure.

5000|$|Magnetic flow meters, {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "mag meters", are technically a velocity-type water meter, except that they use electromagnetic properties to determine the water flow velocity, rather than the mechanical means used by jet and turbine meters. Mag meters use the physics principle of Faraday's law of induction for measurement, and require AC or DC electricity from a power line or battery to operate the electromagnets. Since mag meters have no mechanical <b>measuring</b> <b>element,</b> they normally have the advantage of being able to measure flow in either direction, and use electronics for measuring and totalizing the flow. Mag meters can also be useful for measuring raw (untreated/unfiltered) water and waste-water, since there is no mechanical <b>measuring</b> <b>element</b> to get clogged or damaged by debris flowing through the meter. Strainers are not required with mag meters, since there is no <b>measuring</b> <b>element</b> in the stream of flow that could be damaged. Since stray electrical energy flowing through the flow tube can cause inaccurate readings, most mag meters are installed with either grounding rings or grounding electrodes to divert stray electricity away from the electrodes used to measure the flow inside the flow tube.|$|R

40|$|The {{classification}} {{problem is}} one of the main issues in data mining because it aims to extract a classifier which can be used to predict the classes of objects whose class table are unknown. In the case of classification with complete data, many algorithms have been presented in literature, In the case of classification with incomplete data very few algorithms are there in the literature The situation when information about the value of some features is unknown is not hypothetical In the first case, the lack of information is due to the impossibility of performing some tests when some data are missing some tests can be unnecessary when the classifier could make certain decisions without these test results. In industrial diagnosis, the classifier can work in the online process monitoring the failure of some <b>measuring</b> <b>elements</b> does not have to cause stopping the process if the values given by the rest of the <b>measuring</b> <b>elements</b> are enough to make a decision such that the process is performing properly. When available information is not sufficient then the classifier algorithm classifies the result wrongly.

50|$|One of the {{problems}} with a significant number of technologies is that they are installed through a nozzle and are exposed to products.

Also, as the <b>measuring</b> <b>element</b> is exposed to the contents within the vessel, it may either attack or coat the instrument causing it to fail in service. One of the most reliable methods for measuring level is using a Nuclear gauge, as it is installed outside the vessel and doesn't normally require a nozzle for bulk level measurement.
