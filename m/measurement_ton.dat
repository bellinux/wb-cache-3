It is {{used to determine the}} amount of money to be charged as [...] "Freight" [...] in carrying different sorts of cargo. In general if a cargo is heavier than salt water, the actual tonnage is used. If it is lighter than salt water, e.g. seathers, freight is calculated using Measurement Tons of 40 cubic feet. The freight ton represents the volume of a truck, train or other freight carrier. In the past it has been used for a cargo ship but the register ton is now preferred. It is correctly abbreviated as [...] "FT" [...] but some users are now using freight ton to represent a weight of 1 t, thus the more common abbreviations are now M/T, MT, or MTON (for <b>measurement</b> <b>ton),</b> which still cause it {{to be confused with the}} tonne, or even the megatonne.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the time}} of the passage of COGSA the {{customary}} freight unit for most cargo was the [...] "revenue ton" [...] - the number of long tons (2240 lb, 1017 kg) or measurement tons (100 cubic feet) that would produce the most revenue for the shipowner. For example, a cargo of aluminium ingots, which were not packaged for shipment, would be heavy and dense, so the customary freight unit for aluminum ingots would be the long ton, a measurement of weight. By comparison, a shipment of canoes, which were not packaged for shipment, would be light but would take up a large volume, ensuring the customary freight unit would be the <b>measurement</b> <b>ton</b> of [...] If a canoe were 2 ft wide by 2 ft high by 10 ft long (0.6 m x 0.6 m x 3 m), its measurement would be 40 cubic feet (2 x 2 x 10) which would be one <b>measurement</b> <b>ton</b> (anything less than 100 would be 1 by default) and hence the limitation would be $500 per canoe.|$|E
50|$|A {{shipping}} ton, freight ton, <b>measurement</b> <b>ton</b> or ocean ton is {{a measure}} of volume used for shipments of freight in large vehicles, trains or ships. In the USA, it is equivalent to 40 cubic feet while in the UK it is 42 cubic feet. It {{should not be confused with}} other types of ton which also measure volume.

40|$|The {{average time}} myosin cross bridges remain bound to actin (ton) can be {{measured}} by sinusoidal length perturbations (sinusoidal analysis) of striated muscle fibers using recently developed analytic methods. This approach allows <b>measurements</b> of <b>ton</b> in preparations possessing a physiologically relevant myofilament lattice. In this study, we developed an approach to measure ton in 5 – 10 % of the time required for sinusoidal analysis by using stochastic length perturbations (white noise analysis). To compare these methods, we measured the influence of MgATP concentration ([MgATP]) on ton in demembranated myocardial strips from mice, sampling muscle behavior from 0. 125 to 200 Hz with a 20 -s burst of white noise vs. a 300 -s series of sinusoids. Both methods detected a similar > 300 % increase in ton as [MgATP] decreased from 5 to 0. 25 mM, differing by only 3 – 14 % at any [MgATP]. Additional experiments with Drosophila indirect flight muscle fibers demonstrated that faster cross-bridge cycling kinetics permit further reducing of the perturbation time required to measure ton. This reduced sampling time allowed strain-dependent <b>measurements</b> of <b>ton</b> in flight muscle fibers by combining 10 -s bursts of white noise during periods of linear shortening and lengthening. Analyses revealed longer ton values during shortening and shorter ton values during lengthening. This asymmetry may provide a mechanism that contributes to oscillatory energy transfer between the flight muscles and thoracic cuticle to power flight.

40|$|Acidosis (low pH) is {{the oldest}} {{putative}} agent of muscular fatigue, but the molecular mechanism underlying its depressive effect on muscular performance remains unresolved. Therefore, the effect of low pH on the molecular mechanics and kinetics of chicken skeletal muscle myosin was studied using in vitro motility (IVM) and single molecule laser trap assays. Decreasing pH from 7. 4 to 6. 4 at saturating ATP slowed actin filament velocity (Vactin) in the IVM by 36 %. Single molecule experiments, at 1 μM ATP, decreased the average unitary step size of myosin (d) from 10 ± 2 nm (pH 7. 4) to 2 ± 1 nm (pH 6. 4). Individual binding events at low pH {{were consistent with the}} presence of a population of both productive (average d = 10 nm) and nonproductive (average d = 0 nm) actomyosin interactions. Raising the ATP concentration from 1 μM to 1 mM at pH 6. 4 restored d (9 ± 3 nm), suggesting that the lifetime of the nonproductive interactions is solely dependent on the [ATP]. Vactin, however, was not restored by raising the [ATP] (1 – 10 mM) in the IVM assay, suggesting that low pH also prolongs actin strong binding (<b>ton).</b> <b>Measurement</b> of <b>ton</b> {{as a function of the}} [ATP] in the single molecule assay suggested that acidosis prolongs ton by slowing the rate of ADP release.

50|$|Historically, tonnage was {{the tax on}} tuns (casks) of {{wine that}} held 954 litres (252 gallons) of wine and weighed 1016 {{kilograms}} (2,240 pounds). This suggests that the unit of weight <b>measurement,</b> the long <b>ton</b> (1,016 kg or 2,240 lb), and tonnage share the same etymology. The confusion between weight-based terms (deadweight and displacement) stems from this common source and the eventual decision to assess dues based on a ship's deadweight rather than counting the tuns of wine. In 1720 the Builder's Old Measurement Rule was adopted to estimate deadweight from the length of keel and maximum breadth or beam of a ship.

She was described in the Essex Standard of 27 May 1864 She is a paddle-steamer of 220-horse-power; her cylinders are 54 inches in diameter, with a stroke of 4 feet six inches. Their mean propulsion is 42 revolutions a minute, with a pressure of 28lbs., and a vacuum of 27 in. The paddles which are 16 feet in diameter, are fitted with feathering floats, 8 feet 6 inches long, by 2 feet 10 inches broad. Each engine is fitted with 2 air-pumps, and a separate condenser, so that they are perfectly independent one of the other; and in the event of any break down in the machinery of one, the power of the other will remain intact, and be sufficient to propel the vessel. They are fitted with bilge and feed pumps and a link motion, so as to work the steam expansively.

This offers opportunities for multitude of precision measurements. It is of practical importance to verify if precision <b>measurements</b> with lep- <b>tons</b> in the final state require all theoretical effects evaluated simultaneously or if QED bremsstrahlung in the final state can be separated without unwanted precision loss. Results for final state bremsstrahlung in the decays of narrow resonances are obtained from the Feynman rules of QED in an unambiguous way and can be controlled with a very high precision. Also for resonances of non-negligible width, if calculations are appropriately performed, such separation from the remaining electroweak effects can be expected. Our paper is devoted to validation that final state QED bremsstrahlung can indeed {{be separated from the}} rest of QCD and electroweak effects, in the production and decay of Z and W bosons, and to estimation of the resulting systematic error. The quantitative discussion is based on Monte Carlo programs PHOTOS and SANC, as well as on KKMC which is used for benchmark results. We show, that for a large classes of W and Z boson observables as used at LHC, theoretical error on photonic bremsstrahlung is 0. 1 or 0. 2 %, depending on the program options used. An overall theoretical error on QED final state radiation, i. e. taking into account missing corrections due to pair emission and interference with initial state radiation is estimated respectively at 0. 2 % or 0. 3 % again depending on the program option used.

But, no sooner did the governor see how things were situated, than he boldly luffed up towards the strangers, intending to divert them from the chase of the Abraham; or, at least, to separate them, in chase of himself. In this design he was handsomely seconded by Betts, in the Martha, who hauled his wind {{in the wake of the}} Anne, and carried everything that would draw, in order to keep his station. This decision and show of spirit had its effect. The two brigs, which were most to the southward, altered their course, and edged away for the Anne and Martha, leaving the ship to follow the Abraham alone. The governor was greatly rejoiced at this, for he had a notion a vessel as large as the strange ship would hesitate about entering the narrow waters, on account of her draught; she being much larger than any craft that had ever been in before, as the Kannakas must know, and would not fail to report to the pirates. The governor supposed this ship to be a vessel of between six and seven hundred <b>tons</b> <b>measurement.</b> Her armament appeared to be twelve guns of a side, below, and some eight or ten guns on her quarter-deck and forecastle.

Twenty-nine patients with unilateral TON were included. Horizontal and vertical spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) scans of the fovea were taken in patients with unilateral TON. The main outcome measure was thickness of the entire retina, fRNFL, and GCIPL in eight areas. Thickness of each retinal layer was compared between affected and unaffected eyes. The correlation between the thickness of each retinal layer and visual function parameters, including best corrected visual acuity, color vision, P 100 latency, and P 100 amplitude in visual evoked potential (VEP), mean deviation (MD) and visual field index (VFI) in Humphrey visual field analysis in TON eyes was analyzed. Thicknesses of the entire retina, fRNFL, and GCIPL in SD-OCT were significantly thinner (3 - 36 %) in all <b>measurement</b> areas of <b>TON</b> eyes compared to those in healthy eyes (all p< 0. 05). Whereas, only GCIPL in the outer nasal, superior, and inferior areas was significantly thinner (5 - 10 %) in the early TON eyes than that in the control eyes (all p< 0. 01). A significant correlation was detected between retinal layer thicknesses and visual function parameters including color vision, P 100 latency and P 100 amplitude in VEP, MD, and VFI (particularly P 100 latency, MD, and VFI) (r = - 0. 70 to 0. 84). Among the retinal layers analyzed in this study, GCIPL (particularly in the superior and inferior areas) was most correlated with these five visual function parameters (r = - 0. 70 to 0. 71).
