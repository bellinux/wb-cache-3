He stated that although he knew he may not successfully make a jump or even survive the canyon jump, he followed through with each stunt because he gave his word that he would. Prior to the canyon jump, Knievel stated, [...] "If someone says to you, 'that guy should have never jumped the canyon. You knew if he did, that he'd lose his life and that he was crazy.'

[...] Pepper had been part of an unsuccessful 1948 campaign to [...] "dump Truman" [...] as the Democratic presidential nominee, and Smathers had been his manager and pupil. Smathers challenged the incumbent senator in the Democratic primary and won by a margin of over 60,000 votes. The race was marked by echoes of the Red Scare. Smathers repeatedly attacked Pepper for having Communist sympathies, pointing out his pro-civil rights platform and campaign for universal health care as well as his travels to the Soviet Union in 1945.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the 1950 Florida Senate election, President Harry Truman called George Smathers into {{a meeting}} at the White House and {{reportedly}} said, [...] "I want you to do <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>favor.</b> I want you to beat that son-of-a-bitch Claude Pepper." [...] Pepper had been part of an unsuccessful 1948 campaign to [...] "dump Truman" [...] as the Democratic presidential nominee. Smathers ran against him in the Democratic primary (which at the time in Florida was tantamount to election, the Republican Party still being in infancy there). The contest was extremely heated, and revolved around policy issues, especially charges that Pepper represented the far left and was too supportive of Stalin. Pepper's opponents circulated widely a 49-page booklet titled The Red Record of Senator Claude Pepper. Pepper was defeated in the primary by Smathers.|$|E

6000|$|... "It is also {{a lonely}} thing {{to be a very}} rich woman. People are afraid of my wealth, and of what they call my learning. We two have at least one {{experience}} in common. Now do <b>me</b> <b>a</b> great <b>favor,</b> by going. We have nothing further to say." ...|$|R
