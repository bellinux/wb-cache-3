Such harmonisation ensures that certification of <b>measuring</b> <b>devices</b> in one country is compatible with certification in another, thereby facilitating trade in the <b>measuring</b> <b>devices</b> and in products that rely on the <b>measuring</b> <b>devices.</b> Such products include weighting devices, taxi meters, speedometers, agricultural <b>measuring</b> <b>devices</b> such as cereal moisture meters, health related devices such as exhaust measurements and alcohol content of drinks.|$|R

25|$|There are {{two basic}} ways to reduce random error in an {{epidemiological}} study. The first {{is to increase the}} sample size of the study. In other words, add more subjects to your study. The second is to reduce the variability in measurement in the study. This might be accomplished by using a more precise <b>measuring</b> <b>device</b> or by increasing the number of measurements.|$|E

His most notable <b>measuring</b> <b>device,</b> still in use today, is the Watt indicator incorporating a manometer to measure steam pressure within the cylinder according to the position of the piston, enabling a diagram to be produced representing the pressure of the steam as a function of its volume throughout the cycle.|$|E
25|$|A diode {{can be used}} as a {{temperature}} <b>measuring</b> <b>device,</b> since the forward voltage drop across the diode depends on temperature, as in a silicon bandgap temperature sensor. From the Shockley ideal diode equation given above, it might appear that the voltage has a positive temperature coefficient (at a constant current), but usually the variation of the reverse saturation current term is more significant than the variation in the thermal voltage term. Most diodes therefore have a negative temperature coefficient, typically −2 mV/˚C for silicon diodes. The temperature coefficient is approximately constant for temperatures above about 20 kelvins. Some graphs are given for 1N400x series, and CY7 cryogenic temperature sensor.|$|E

40|$|The {{review of}} system {{approaches}} {{to the analysis of}} <b>measuring</b> <b>devices</b> has allowed to reveal the following: 1. General theory of converters based on power representations (the power approach), establishes communications between expressions of the energy reserved in system, and forces arising in it; application of the information approach to the analysis of <b>measuring</b> <b>devices</b> gives the chance to connect known thermodynamic parities with quantity of the information received at measurements and by that to create the theoretical base to the decision of many practical questions of instrument making; the power-information approach to the analysis of <b>measuring</b> <b>devices</b> essentially facilitates both the analysis and synthesis of technical decisions of <b>measuring</b> <b>devices.</b> 2. Differentiation on scopes of <b>measuring</b> <b>devices</b> would lead to sharp dissociation of separate areas if there were no general theoretical bases covering development of all measuring techniques. Now, with a view of creation of uniform space of knowledge as systems for the subsequent importation in subsystems, ontology is developed for each system approach. It will allow to describe at the subsequent level of abstraction ontology of system approaches with the assumption that the following level of abstraction will be the general categories of knowledge structures...|$|R
25|$|A {{systematic}} error or bias occurs {{when there is}} a difference between the true value (in the population) and the observed value (in the study) from any cause other than sampling variability. An example of {{systematic error}} is if, unknown to you, the pulse oximeter you are using is set incorrectly and adds two points to the true value each time a measurement is taken. The <b>measuring</b> <b>device</b> could be precise but not accurate. Because the error happens in every instance, it is systematic. Conclusions you draw based on that data will still be incorrect. But the error can be reproduced in the future (e.g., by using the same mis-set instrument).|$|E

25|$|Tyndall {{explained}} {{the heat in}} the Earth's atmosphere {{in terms of the}} capacities of the various gases in the air to absorb radiant heat, also known as infrared radiation. His <b>measuring</b> <b>device,</b> which used thermopile technology, is an early landmark in the history of absorption spectroscopy of gases. He was the first to correctly measure the relative infrared absorptive powers of the gases nitrogen, oxygen, water vapour, carbon dioxide, ozone, methane, etc. (year 1859). He concluded that water vapour is the strongest absorber of radiant heat in the atmosphere and is the principal gas controlling air temperature. Absorption by the other gases is not negligible but relatively small. Prior to Tyndall it was widely surmised that the Earth's atmosphere has a Greenhouse Effect, but {{he was the first to}} prove it. The proof was that water vapour strongly absorbed infrared radiation. Relatedly, Tyndall in 1860 was first to demonstrate and quantify that visually transparent gases are infrared emitters.|$|E

500|$|For {{both the}} gas {{proportional}} counter and liquid scintillation counter, what is measured {{is the number}} of beta particles detected in a given time period. Since the mass of the sample is known, this can be converted to a standard measure of activity in units of either counts per minute per gram of carbon (cpm/g C), or becquerels per kg (Bq/kg C, in SI units). Each <b>measuring</b> <b>device</b> is also used to measure the activity of a blank sample– a sample prepared from carbon old enough to have no activity. This provides a value for the background radiation, which must be subtracted from the measured activity of the sample being dated to get the activity attributable solely to that sample's [...] In addition, a sample with a standard activity is measured, to provide a baseline for comparison.|$|E
