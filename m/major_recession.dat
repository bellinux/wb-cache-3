The Allied occupation ended with the Treaty of San Francisco in 1952 and Japan was granted membership in the United Nations in 1956. Japan later achieved rapid growth to become the second-largest economy in the world, until surpassed by China in 2010. This ended in the mid-1990s when Japan suffered a <b>major</b> <b>recession.</b> In {{the beginning of the}} 21st century, positive growth has signaled a gradual economic recovery.

25|$|Soon afterwards, {{political}} instability afflicted {{the country and}} the economy anew with Abu Sayyaf terrors intensifying. The administration's Legitimacy Crisis also became a hot issue and threat to the authority of the Arroyo administration. Moreover, the Arroyo administration went through many raps and charges because of some controversial deals such as the NBN-ZTE Broadband Deal. Due however to the support of local leaders and the majority of the House of Representatives, political stability was restored and threats to the administration were quelled and subdued. Towards the end of the administration, high inflation rates for rice and oil in 2008 started to plague the country anew, and this led to another fiscal crisis, which actually came along with the <b>major</b> <b>recession</b> that the United States {{and the rest of the}} world were actually experiencing.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} situation for most residents declined through the 1980s, {{with many of}} the original residents already coming from poor economic backgrounds in slums. The Birmingham Municipal Bank opened a branch in Castle Vale Shopping Centre and banks provided a vital source of money for Castle Vale residents. However, the last bank closed in 1987, leading to a greater reliance on illegal loan sharks. Additionally, the unemployment rate was on average 50% higher than the city average by 1992, and in some pockets of the estate, the unemployment rate was 40%. This was one of the highest levels in the country, which was in the depths of a <b>major</b> <b>recession</b> at the time, and unemployment had even continued to plague Castle Vale following the previous recession in the early 1980s after which the national unemployment level had halved within three years.|$|E
25|$|Partly due to grief {{over the}} death of his daughter, Anna, Clay chose not to run in the 1836 presidential election, and the Whigs were too disorganized to {{nominate}} a single candidate. Four Whig candidates ran against Van Buren: General William Henry Harrison, Senator Hugh Lawson White, Senator Daniel Webster, and Senator Willie Person Mangum. Though Clay privately preferred Webster, he supported Harrison after Harrison emerged as the most popular and prominent Whig candidate. Van Buren won the 1836 election with 50.8 {{percent of the popular vote}} and 170 of the 294 electoral votes. Discouraged by the Democratic victory, Clay began pondering retirement from public life. However, Van Buren's presidency was quickly hit by the Panic of 1837, a <b>major</b> <b>recession</b> that badly damaged the Democratic Party, and Clay resumed his status as a Congressional leader.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{replacement}} of interim CEO Jay Salmen by Stan Gadek, former CFO of AirTran Airways, Sun Country was nearly finished by the <b>major</b> <b>recession</b> of 2008 and the revelation of financial fraud on a massive scale. The airline furloughed 45 of its 156 pilots and scaled back its summer schedule due to rising fuel costs. Sun Country indicated it had hoped {{to get up to}} $50 million in loans or other financial help from the state of Minnesota and the airports commission. In September 2008 the carrier reduced, and in some cases eliminated, flights to San Francisco and Los Angeles. It also began charging $12 for the first checked bag, following most major U.S. carriers. At the end of September 2008, Gadek called for a 50% pay-deferral to all remaining employees. Also on the 28th, Tom Petters resigned after an FBI probe discovered that the airline had suffered financial fraud on a massive scale. Following this, the airline filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, for the second time, on October 6, 2008, in order to separate itself from the other Petters companies that were being taken over by a court appointee. On Christmas Eve, full pay was restored to all employees. Employees were also promised back-pay with interest.|$|E

The analysis reveals both continuities and {{significant changes in the}} regional impact of recession from one economic cycle to the next.

2500|$|With {{a lack of}} {{consumer}} confidence in the economic direction given {{by the federal government}} panic started to spread across the country shortly after the Wall Street Crash of 1929. President Hoover retained the Gold Standard as the country’s currency gauge throughout the following years. As a result, the American shareholders with the majority of the gold reserves began to grow wary of the value of gold in the near future. Europe’s decision {{to move away from the}} Gold Standard caused individuals to start to withdraw gold shares and move the investments out of the country or began to horde gold for future investment. The market continued to suffer due to these reactions, and in result caused several of the everyday individuals to speculate on the economy in the coming months. [...] Rumors of market stability and banking conditions began to spread, consumer confidence continued to drop and panic begin to set in. Contagion spread like wild fire pushing Americans all over the country to withdraw their deposits in mass. This idea would continue from 1929-1933 causing the greatest financial crisis ever seen at the banking level pushing the economic recovery efforts further from resolution. An increase in the currency-deposit ratio and a money stock determinant forced money stock to fall and income to decline. This panic-induced banking failure took a mild recession to a <b>major</b> <b>recession.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{economic}} impact of two <b>major</b> <b>recessions</b> in the United States (in the 1970 s and early 1980 s), together with cutbacks in federal spending during the 1980 s, have made individual states more aware of their comparative advantage both in economic and in political terms.

In this paper we explore the complex nature of science policy in the US intergovernmental system, examine the rigorous resource allocation issues involved, and look {{at a number of}} different types of technology-based economic development policies that have to date grown around the country. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{progressive}} {{globalization of}} markets has sparked a worldwide interest in using economic indicators to analyze cyclical fluctuations. Governments {{and the private}} sector seeking to conduct their activities in light of both national and international economic conditions could benefit from international indicators that serve as a warning system to detect <b>recessions</b> in <b>major</b> economic partners and in industrialized countries as a whole.; This article constructs just such a warning system. Using a Markov-switching dynamic factor model with a self-adjusting variable-bandwidth filter, the authors construct business cycle indicators for G 7 countries and for an aggregate measure of output by twenty-nine member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The model yields probabilities of the current business cycle phase for each G 7 country and for the aggregate OECD and G 7 output measures and reveals a common cycle underlying the OECD countries that characterizes an international business cycle.; The proposed filter sorts out minor contractions and estimates only <b>major</b> economic <b>recessions</b> and expansions, thereby minimizing the occurrence of false turning points.

We show that this indicator corresponds to the reciprocal of the markup of price over social marginal cost, and give some evidence in support of this interpretation. We then show that, with some auxiliary assumptions, our gap variable may be used to measure the efficiency costs of business fluctuations. We find that the latter costs are modest on average. However, {{to the extent that the}} flexible price equilibrium is distorted, the gross efficiency losses from recessions and gains from booms may be large. Indeed, we find that the <b>major</b> <b>recessions</b> involved large efficiency losses.
