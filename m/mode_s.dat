5000|$|Another mode called <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> (Select) is {{designed}} to help avoiding overinterrogation of the transponder (having many radars in busy areas) and to allow automatic collision avoidance. <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> transponders are compatible with Mode A and Mode C Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) systems. [...] This is the type of transponder that is used for TCAS or ACAS II (Airborne Collision Avoidance System) functions, and is required to implement the extended squitter broadcast, one means of participating in ADS-B systems. A TCAS-equipped aircraft must have a <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> transponder, but not all <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> transponders include TCAS. Likewise, a <b>Mode</b> <b>S</b> transponder is required to implement 1090ES extended squitter ADS-B Out, but {{there are other ways to}} implement ADS-B Out (in the U.S. and China.)

40|$|Ultrasonic guided waves have {{recently}} been used in fracture evaluation and fracture healing monitoring. An axial transmission technique {{has been used to}} quantify the impact of the gap breakage width and fracture angle on the amplitudes of low order guided wave <b>modes</b> <b>S</b> 0 and A 0 under a 100 [*]kHz narrowband excitation. In our two dimensional finite-difference time-domain (2 D-FDTD) simulation, the long bones are modeled as three layers with a soft tissue overlay and marrow underlay. The simulations of the transversely and obliquely fractured long bones show that the amplitudes of both S 0 and A 0 decrease as the gap breakage widens. Fixing the crack width, the increase of the fracture angle relative to the cross section perpendicular to the long axis enhances the amplitude of A 0, while the amplitude of S 0 shows a nonmonotonic trend with the decrease of the fracture angle. The amplitude ratio between the S 0 and A 0 modes is used to quantitatively evaluate the fracture width and angles. The study suggests that the low order guided wave <b>modes</b> <b>S</b> 0 and A 0 have potentials for transverse and oblique bone fracture evaluation and fracture healing monitoring...|$|R

40|$|IAG Symposium, Cairns, Australia, 22 - 26 August, 2005 The recent Mw = 9. 3 Sumatra-Andaman {{earthquake}} on December 26 th 2004 has strongly excited the low-frequency seismic {{modes of}} the Earth. In particular the large amplitude {{of the fundamental}} radial <b>mode</b> 0 <b>S</b> 0, which consists of a roughly uniform compression and dilatation of the whole Earth, and of the seismic core <b>modes,</b> like 3 <b>S</b> 2, means that much energy was radiated toward the core. Also the degree one <b>mode</b> 2 <b>S</b> 1, which corresponds to a translation of the core in the mantle, was clearly observed {{for the first time}} without any stacking process on seismometers and on gravimeters. 2 S 1 is the first harmonic of the degree one <b>mode</b> 1 <b>S</b> 1, the so-called Slichter triplet. In fact, the Slichter mode is not an elastic spheroidal <b>mode</b> like 2 <b>S</b> 1 since its main feedback force is the Archimedean force. The Slichter mode corresponds to a translation of the solid inner core inside the fluid outer core. The theory concerning this mode is still poorly constrained and no convincing detection has been suggested yet. This paper presents theoretical predictions of the amplitude of the Slichter mode after the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake as well as after some largest events in the past decades. The computation is based on the usual normal mode theory for a spherically symmetric non-rotating Earth model. The source parameters are finally investigated to find the optimal seismic mechanism to excite the translational motion of the inner core...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to their}} very low noise {{levels in the}} low {{frequency}} band (&lt; 1 mHz), superconducting gravimeters (SGs) are particularly suitable to observe long-period free oscillations of the Earth. This case study {{is dedicated to the}} detection of the triplet of the seismic normal <b>mode</b> 3 <b>S</b> 1 that was excited by the December 26, 2004, Sumatra-Andaman earthquake (Mw = 9. 3). Some SG records and the Hilbert-Huang transformation are used as an alternative data preprocessing technique, instead of the traditional detiding method. After removal of atmospheric pressure effects from the original SG records, we applied the Hilbert-Huang transformation to the SG residues, to select the signals that included the frequency band of interest, and to construct a new data series. Then, by applying the multi-station experimental technique to five 273 -h-long common new data series recorded at different SG stations, we clearly observed all of the three singlets of the <b>mode</b> 3 <b>S</b> 1 , with the central singlet more evident compared to previous studies. Observations of the low-frequency <b>modes</b> 3 <b>S</b> 1 (n = 0, 1, 2, [...] .; l = = 1, 2, [...] .) provide constraints on the inner and outer core structure.

The analysis of the fast dynamics associated with this low-frequency instability is well described by single-mode rate equations. In the multimode regime, fast pulsation is observed in every laser mode.
