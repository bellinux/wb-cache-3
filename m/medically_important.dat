25|$|Ixodes holocyclus, {{commonly}} known as the Australian paralysis tick, is one of about 75 species of Australian tick fauna and is considered the most <b>medically</b> <b>important.</b> It can cause paralysis by injecting neurotoxins into its host. It is usually found in a 20-kilometre wide band following the eastern coastline of Australia. Within this range Ixodes holocyclus is the tick most frequently encountered by humans and their pets. As this area also contains the majority of Australia's most densely populated regions, incidents of bites on people, pets and livestock are relatively common.|$|E

This information will further aid forensic entomologists as well as investigators in solving medicocriminal investigations. Also, continued research on mitochondrial DNA analysis will be able to provide more identifications in cases where identification may have seemed impossible.

40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to the ECG-dedicated {{compression}} algorithm based on the event-driven variable quantization level in three upper octaves of the time-frequency signal representation. The algorithm uses an integer-to-integer reversible wavelet transform and the segmentation procedure developed for diagnostic purpose.

Although the global compression efficiency and distortion ratio are not outstanding comparing to other compression methods, the main advantage of our method is the concentration of distortions out of the <b>medically</b> most <b>important</b> areas. For this reason, from the medical point of view, our method guarantees high fidelity of reconstructed signal and, in consequence, high reliability of signal-derived diagnostic parameters.

2500|$|Consumers {{are exposed}} to {{antibiotic}} resistance through consumption of poultry products that have prior exposure to resistant strains. In poultry husbandry, the practice of using <b>medically</b> <b>important</b> antibiotics can select for resistant strains of bacteria, which are then transferred to consumers through poultry meat and eggs. The CDC acknowledges this transferral pathway in their 2013 report of Antibiotic Resistant Threats in the United States. [...] The annual rate of foodborne illness in the United States is one in six. For the 48 million individuals affected, antibiotics {{play a critical role}} in thwarting mortality rates. [...] In a literature review conducted by the Review of Antimicrobial Resistance 100 out of 139 studies found evidence of a link between antibiotic use in animals and antibiotic resistance in consumers.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{policies}} have been proposed to improve data collection and transparency in livestock production. [...] For example, the 2013 Delivering Antimicrobial Transparency in Animals (DATA) Act proposed the enactment of policies to acquire more accurate documentation of antibiotic use in growth promotion by farmers, drug manufacturers, and the FDA. [...] Also, the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act (PAMTA) was enacted to eliminate the use of <b>medically</b> <b>important</b> antibiotics in livestock. [...] In 2015, the Preventing Antibiotic Resistance Act (PARA) was passed with two components: requirement of drug companies to provide evidence that antibiotics that are approved for use in poultry, and that meat production does not add to the growing threat of antibiotic resistance in humans.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{availability}} of rotavirus vaccines {{has resulted in}} an intensification of post vaccine strain surveillance efforts worldwide to gain information {{on the impact of}} vaccines on prevalence of circulating rotavirus strains. OBJECTIVES: In this study, the distribution of human rotavirus G and P types in Hungary is reported. In addition, the VP 4 and VP 7 genes of G 1 P[8] strains were sequenced to monitor if vaccine-derived strains were introduced and/or some strains/lineages were selected against. STUDY DESIGN: The study was conducted in 8 geographic areas of Hungary between 2007 and 2011. Rotavirus positive stool samples were collected from diarrheic patients mostly < 5 years of age. Viral RNA was amplified by multiplex genotyping RT-PCR assay, targeting the <b>medically</b> most <b>important</b> G and P types. When needed, sequencing of the VP 7 and VP 4 genes was performed.

During growth the venom-mass increases according to a fourth order function of the prosoma size, which mainly reflects an increase of the venom gland volume. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed increasing percentages of proteins ≤ 17 kDa from 4. 1 % in the smallest analysed spiders (2 – 3 months-old) to 79. 1 % in adult female venom.
