2500|$|The formal beatification of Faustina {{involved}} {{the case of}} Maureen Digan of Massachusetts. In March 1981 Digan reported a healing, while praying at the tomb of Faustina. Digan had suffered from Lymphedema (a disease which causes significant swelling due to fluid retention) for decades, and had undergone ten operations, including a leg amputation. Digan reported that while praying at Faustina's tomb, she heard a voice saying [...] "ask for <b>my</b> <b>help</b> and I will help you" [...] and her constant pain stopped. After two days, Digan reported that her foot - which had previously been too large for her shoe due to her body's liquid retention, was healed. Upon her return to the United States, five Boston area physicians stated that she was healed (with no medical explanation) and the case was declared miraculous by the Vatican in 1992 based on the additional testimony of over 20 witnesses about her prior condition.|$|E
