5|$|This idea {{remained}} with Nansen during following years. After his triumphant return from Greenland {{he began to}} develop a detailed plan for a polar venture, which he made public in February 1890 {{at a meeting of}} the recently formed Norwegian Geographical Society. Previous expeditions, he argued, had approached the North Pole from the west, and had failed because they were working against the prevailing east-west current. The secret of success was to work with this current. A workable plan, Nansen said, would require a small, strong and <b>manoeuvrable</b> <b>ship</b> capable of carrying fuel and provisions for twelve men for five years. The ship would sail to the approximate location of Jeannette's sinking, and would enter the ice. It would then drift west with the current towards the pole and beyond it, eventually reaching the sea between Greenland and Spitsbergen.|$|E

[...] The ship would then drift with the ice towards the pole and eventually reach the sea between Greenland and Spitsbergen. Should the ship founder, a possibility which Nansen thought very unlikely, the party would camp on a floe and allow itself to be carried towards safety. Nansen observed: [...] "If the Jeannette Expedition had had sufficient provisions, and had remained on the ice-floe on which the relics were found, the result would doubtless have been very different from what it was." ...|$|E

5000|$|.....From about 1933 on, the Admiralty showed {{increasing}} interest in dive-bombing, {{as the best}} means of accurate delivery against small and highly <b>manoeuvrable</b> <b>ships.</b> Dive-bombing was also particularly attractive {{as a means of}} neutralizing enemy aircraft carriers, which some in the Fleet Air Arm considered their primary targets. British observers seem to have been impressed by US demonstrations...|$|R
50|$|At Naulochus, Agrippa met Sextus' fleet. Both fleets were {{composed}} of 300 ships, all with artillery, but Agrippa commanded heavier units, {{armed with the}} arpax and corvus. Agrippa succeeded in blocking the more <b>manoeuvrable</b> <b>ships</b> of Sextus and, after a long and bloody fight, to defeat his enemy. Agrippa lost three ships, while 28 ships of Sextus were sunk, 17 fled, and the others burnt or captured.|$|R
5|$|Both sides had {{suffered}} severe damage and casualties, but both were also {{aware that the}} battle would inevitably be rejoined and so {{the aftermath of the}} British defeat was one of frenzied activity at Gibraltar, Algeciras and Cadiz. While the British and French squadrons conducted hasty repairs, the French and Spanish fleet at Cadiz was prepared for a rescue mission, a heavy squadron arriving at Algeciras on 12 July. As the squadron departed with Linois's squadron, it was attacked again by Saumarez's squadron at the Second Battle of Algeciras and caught at night by faster and more <b>manoeuvrable</b> <b>ships,</b> which resulted in the British inflicting heavy losses on the Spanish rearguard but failing to destroy the French squadron for a second time.|$|R

2500|$|The Tribals, {{including}} Gurkha had a main gun armament {{of eight}} 4.7-inch (120mm) QF Mark XII guns in four twin power-driven mounts. Separate Low-Angle and High-Angle gun directors were fitted for anti-ship and anti-aircraft fire, although the guns could only elevate to 40 degrees, which was {{judged to be}} sufficient for long-range anti-aircraft in defence of a fleet. High level air-attack was not judged {{to be a threat}} against fast and <b>manoeuvrable</b> <b>ships</b> like destroyers. Close-in anti aircraft armament consisted of a quadruple 2-pounder [...] "pom-pom mount and two quadruple Vickers [...]50 machine guns. Torpedo armament consisted of a power-operated quadruple bank of 21-inch (530mm) torpedo tubes. Anti-submarine armament consisted of two depth charge throwers and one rack, with a total of 30 depth charges carried.|$|R

25|$|In 1588, {{hoping to}} put a stop to Elizabeth's intervention, Philip sent the Spanish Armada to invade England. Unfavourable weather, plus heavily armed and <b>manœuvrable</b> English <b>ships,</b> and the fact that the English had been warned by their spies in the Netherlands and were ready for the attack {{resulted}} in a defeat for the Armada. However, the failure of the Drake–Norris Expedition to Portugal and the Azores in 1589 marked a turning point in the on-off 1585–1604 Anglo–Spanish War. The Spanish fleets became more effective in transporting greatly increased quantities of silver and gold from the Americas, while English attacks suffered costly failures.|$|R
50|$|During the 16th {{century the}} galleon {{evolved from the}} carrack. It was a longer and more <b>manoeuvrable</b> type of <b>ship</b> with all the {{advantages}} of the carrack. The main ships of the English and Spanish fleets in the Battle of Gravelines of 1588 were galleons; all of the English and most of the Spanish galleons survived the battle and the following storm even though the Spanish galleons suffered the heaviest attacks from the English while regrouping their scattered fleet. By the 17th century every major European naval power was building ships like these.|$|R
40|$|Viking warriors from Scandinavia {{began to}} attack the coasts of western Europe {{towards the end of}} the eighth century. Christian writers {{registered}} their shock and horror at these raids by pagans upon monasteries, churches and royal sites. The raiders were mobile, using highly <b>manoeuvrable</b> light-weight sailing <b>ships,</b> which could also be rowed. They caught te armies of the Christian kingdoms unprepared, lacking the organisation to deal with them effectively. But there was much more to the Vikings than mere raiding for portable wealth, which in any case had been a regular activity in European societies for sometime. It was Norwegian Vikings who first travelled to Scotland and into the Irish Sea, exploring and raiding. It was an easy journey from the west coast of Norway to the Northern Isles of Scotland and thence through the Western Isles to Ireland, Wales and Aquitaine. Within a generation or two Norwegians were settling in the Scottish islands, where their characteristic place-names survive on modern maps, showing the centres from which they worked the land. Their pagan burials, accompanied by grave goods have been recognised in the same area. Some Viking leaders became rulers in the British Isles, for example the earls of Orkney and the kings of Man. In Ireland Vikings founded commercial settlements, which became major Irish towns, such as Dublin. Archaeological evidence suggests that goods from all over the known world were brought into these centres. Vikings were not just raiders; they were political leaders, merchants, farmers, craftspeople, fishermen and poets. We will glimpse them on this course by using all sorts of evidence, documentary and archaeological, including sculptures, buildings, small finds, place-names and inscriptions. Your view of the Vikings may be changed forever by taking this course! By examining carefully the written and archaeological evidence, this course will attempt to view the Viking Age dispassionately. By studying the archaeology of pre-Viking Denmark we shall be able to see what caused Danes to set sail for Europe. Ships of course are an important factor. Ship-building, ship-handling and navigation were skills learned prior to these voyages. We will assess the impact of the Vikings in Scotland and Ireland. What changes were stimulated by their arrival and settlement? Examination of archaeological finds such as stone sculptures, weapons, jewellery, coins, and pottery as well as urban and rural settlements and buildings will help us to understand the period. ...|$|R
