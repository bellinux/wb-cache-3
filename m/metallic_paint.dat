40|$|Humans {{recognize}} objects visually on {{the basis}} of material composition as well as shape. To acquire a certain level of photorealism, it is necessary to analyze, how the materials scatter the incident light. The key quantity for expressing the directional optical effect of materials on the incident radiance is the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). Our work is devoted to the BRDF measurements, in order to render the synthetic images, mostly of the <b>metallic</b> <b>paints.</b> We measured the spectral reflectance off multiple paint samples then used the measured data to fit the analytical BRDF model, in order to acquire its parameters. In this paper we describe the methodology of the image synthesis from measured data. Materials such as the <b>metallic</b> <b>paints</b> exhibit a sparkling effect caused by the metallic particles scattered within the paint volume. Our analysis of sparkling effect is based on the processing of the multiple photographs. Results of analysis and the measurements were incorporated into the rendering process of car pain...|$|R

25|$|The 1993 40th Anniversary {{package was}} {{available}} on all models. It included Ruby Red <b>metallic</b> <b>paint</b> and Ruby Red leather sport seats, along with special trim and emblems. 6,749 were sold at an additional cost of $1,455. All leather seats have the 40th emblem embroidered {{due to an}} error on the drawings sent to the seat supplier.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1990s {{the vehicle}} {{attempted}} to climb {{more and more}} upmarket, while remaining true to its working roots. This trend was epitomised by limited-edition vehicles, such as the SV90 in 1992 with roll-over protection cage, alloy wheels and <b>metallic</b> <b>paint</b> and the 50th anniversary 90 in 1998, equipped with automatic transmission, air conditioning and Range Rover 4.0-litre V8 engine.|$|E
25|$|For the 1983 model year, the Volkswagen {{received}} new {{front seats}} with adjustable headrests, already seen in cars such the Caribe and the Atlantic. A newly added item was the hand brake {{light on the}} dashboard. 1983 also introduced a limited edition Aubergine <b>Metallic</b> <b>paint</b> scheme. This also featured its wheels painted to match the body color and seats upholstered in tweed Grey and Aubergine.|$|E

The Sun Hatch could be had with either manual or automatic transmission, with the manual version priced at £3,954 and the automatic version priced at £4,167.|$|E
25|$|Power {{steering}} and power drum brakes were also standard, as on all Rambler Custom models. The car was {{available only in}} silver <b>metallic</b> <b>paint</b> accented with gold anodized aluminum inserts along the sides. Padded dashboards and visors, rear child proof door locks, and seat belts were all optional. A total of 1,500 Rebels were produced in 1957. Integrated air conditioning system, the All Weather Eye was a $345 option.|$|E
25|$|New for 2002 was a $2,695 40th Anniversary option package which {{included}} the NASCAR-inspired rear spoiler and roof fences, polished dual-outlet exhaust tips, hood with heat extractors, and 15-spoke chrome wheels previously offered with the 2001 Special Edition package. Unique elements such as the Dark Cherry <b>Metallic</b> <b>paint,</b> 40th Anniversary badges, and Ruby Red and Graphite interior trim with the 40th Anniversary logo embroidered on the front seats and floormats differentiated this option package from the previous year's offering.|$|E
25|$|For 1999 the R was {{available}} in 7 colours: Black Stone, Nautic Blue Pearl, Silver Metallic, Cassis, Venetian Red Pearl, Dark Olive Green, Laser Blue. All apart from the first one were <b>metallic</b> <b>paints</b> with Laser Blue being only available on the R. FWD and manual transmissions were no longer available, only AWD in combination with a 4-speed automatic. Cars were badged V70 R AWD. Power was increased to 250PS. Blue engine covers were introduced for R models.|$|R
50|$|Much {{like the}} TV series, this toy line is unique for its cartoonish designs. In {{keeping with the}} {{animated}} theme, each figure is molded and/or painted in a matte finish, as opposed to figures of other Transformers lines using gloss finishes. <b>Metallic</b> <b>paints</b> are also used sparingly on most figures. The only exception to this rule is Leader Class Ultra Magnus, who uses gloss black on some body panels. The Japanese release versions of nearly all the toys, however, are <b>painted</b> in a <b>metallic</b> finish.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Majorette brand survives. After Majorette's {{parent company}} Ideal loisirs {{was purchased by}} the German entity Triumph Adler, now entering the 21st century, batches of better castings have been introduced, {{as well as an}} image face lift that includes a modified logo, and a toning down of the bright aesthetics of the 1980s and 1990s. This was in touch with the automobile industry's trend of using plainer, <b>metallic</b> <b>paints.</b> Despite some occasional poor paint choices, and an intriguing fixation with the silver grey, the style change has been successful.|$|R
25|$|The Flight cost £10,380 {{and offered}} {{electric}} front windows, a three-speed fan and a cassette player. For an additional £1,000 the Finesse added alloy wheels, air conditioning, a CD player, fog lamps and <b>metallic</b> <b>paint.</b> The more competitive prices {{managed to keep}} European Escort sales going until the last one rolled off the Halewood assembly line in July 2000, making it the last Ford car to be assembled there. The plant was transferred to Jaguar that year for the new X-Type saloon, and following the later merger with Land Rover and {{the sale of the}} plant to Tata, Ford now only has a small presence at Halewood - retaining the transmission works at the site.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, the {{development}} of the anti-aircraft proximity fuse required an electronic circuit that could withstand being fired from a gun, and could be produced in quantity. The Centralab Division of Globe Union submitted a proposal which met the requirements: a ceramic plate would be screenprinted with <b>metallic</b> <b>paint</b> for conductors and carbon material for resistors, with ceramic disc capacitors and subminiature vacuum tubes soldered in place. The technique proved viable, and the resulting patent on the process, which was classified by the U.S. Army, was assigned to Globe Union. It was not until 1984 that the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) awarded Mr. Harry W. Rubinstein, the former head of Globe Union's Centralab Division, its coveted Cledo Brunetti Award for early key contributions to {{the development}} of printed components and conductors on a common insulating substrate. As well, Mr. Rubinstein was honored in 1984 by his alma mater, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, for his innovations in the technology of printed electronic circuits and the fabrication of capacitors.|$|E
25|$|The 1988 Chevrolet Nova added a sporty {{model to}} its lineup of subcompact {{front-wheel-drive}} cars. This new 1988 Chevrolet Nova Twin-Cam {{got its name}} from a double-overhead-cam version of the Toyota-built 1.6-liter four-cylinder. Novas continued to share their basic design with the Corolla, and this engine had previously {{been used in the}} Toyota FX-16, a performance version of the Corolla. The twin-cam produced , 36 more than its single-cam sibling. A five-speed manual transmission was standard, as in the regular Novas, but the Twin-Cam offered a four-speed automatic as an option versus the three-speed offered on other models. The more potent engine elevated the 1988 Chevrolet Nova Twin-Cam into junior sport-sedan territory, but the advancement didn't come cheaply. The base Nova listed at about $8,800, the Twin-Cam went for $11,395. That price included fuel injection, sport suspension, power steering, leather-covered steering wheel, tachometer, four-wheel disc brakes, and wider tires on aluminum wheels, but it was a stiff tariff, and few were ordered (approximately 3,300 Twin-Cam models were built). There were no color choices; all 1988 Chevrolet Nova Twin-Cams wore black <b>metallic</b> <b>paint</b> with a grey interior; and there was no hatchback version offered. Every 1988 Chevrolet Nova got rear shoulder belts, rear window defogger, and AM/FM stereo radio as standard equipment. This was the last model year for the Nova name at Chevrolet. Starting with 1989, Chevrolet pushed this car into its new Geo division and renamed it the Prizm. Geo was Chevy's effort {{to come up with an}} import-sounding label to attract buyers who were not inclined to shop American.|$|E
50|$|Through her use {{of mixed}} media such as acrylics, <b>metallic</b> <b>paints,</b> resins and mementos from her {{personal}} archives, Ferreira has successfully seized critics and collectors' attention {{in a relatively short}} amount of time. In an interview with Fabrik, Ferreira notes her desire to capture energy as the impetus for her artwork and attributes her awareness of this human energy to her success. Her work has been purchased by numerous corporations and has procured a substantial private and celebrity list of collectors that includes musicians, film stars and producers.|$|R
25|$|For 1998 the R was {{available}} in 6 colours: Black Stone, Nautic Blue, Silver Metallic, Coral Red, Regency Red, Saffron. All apart from the first one were <b>metallic</b> <b>paints</b> with Saffron only being available for the V70 R. Versions offered included FWD & AWD, both with either a 4-speed automatic or 5-speed manual transmission. Cars with the automatic transmission were rated at 240PS, while manual transmission cars featured a bigger turbo bumping up power by 10PS to 250PS and torque to 350NM. FWD manual transmission equipped R featured a viscous based limited-slip differential. In the US neither FWD nor manual transmissions were offered.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a new approach}} to modelling pearlescent paints based on decomposing paint layers into stacks of imaginary thin sublayers. The sublayers are chosen so thin that multiple scattering can be considered across different sublayers, while it can be neglected within each of the sublayers. Based on this assumption, an efficient recursive procedure of assembling the layers is developed, which enables to compute the paint BRDF at interactive speeds. Since the proposed paint model connects fundamental optical properties of multi-layer pearlescent and <b>metallic</b> <b>paints</b> with their microscopic structure, interactive prediction of the paint appearance based on its composition becomes possible...|$|R

500|$|Prior to the release, Gaga {{unveiled}} three cover artworks, {{which were}} photographed by Steven Klein. The first one shows Gaga naked with a scorpion balanced {{on her head}} inspired by performance artist Marina Abramović. In the second image, the singer stands naked with a kebab in her mouth, while the third shows a dead bat laying flat on its back. A writer for Rap-Up called the artworks [...] "striking", while Metro commented that the covers were only more [...] "photo of Lady Gaga doing something weird." [...] John Walker from MTV News {{found it difficult to}} understand the meaning behind the artworks, but nevertheless found them compelling. When the song debuted on YouTube, yet another picture was used to accompany the audio showing Gaga in <b>metallic</b> <b>paint</b> with a scorpion attached to her head.|$|E
500|$|To sustain {{interest}} in the Samba {{towards the end of}} its life, PSA launched a few concept and special versions of the model. The Copacabana was a Samba-based concept car, featuring body elements painted in garish colors. It was followed by the 1984 Samba Sympa production model, targeted at [...] "young buyers", which came in silver <b>metallic</b> <b>paint,</b> with a choice of yellow, red or blue highlights and either a radio or a sunroof. In 1985, the sunroof became standard and only yellow highlights were available. The Samba Bahia (marketed as the Samba Trio in the UK) was a 1985 model, also targeted at younger customers. It came with the 1.1litre engine, denim-covered seats, and a sunroof, and was painted in metallic blue. The Samba Style model was launched with both radio and sunroof as standard, but not the colorful highlights, essentially to facilitate the sales of the last Samba series.|$|E
40|$|Hidden {{integration}} of 79 GHz sensors behind plastic and painted fascia represents a challenging task since both electromagnetic and car body design constraints {{have to be}} met. This paper compares different possibilities for low-cost {{integration of}} radar sensors. Based on a model for stratified media, {{a study of the}} most important parameters such as bandwidth, angle and tolerances is shown. Our results suggest that for plastic fascia, the requirements of future radar sensors can be met with low-cost matching.

40|$|The outside {{appearance}} of cars is mostly defined through only two distinct materials – glass and car paint. While glass can rather easily be simulated {{by the simple}} physical laws of reflection and refraction, modelling car paint is more challenging. In this paper we present a framework for the efficient acquisition and realistic rendering of realworld car paint. This is achieved by building an easy-to-reproduce measuring setup, fitting the measured data to a general BRDF model for car paint, adding a component for simulating the sparkling effect of <b>metallic</b> <b>paints,</b> and rendering using a specially designed shader in a realtime ray tracer...|$|R
50|$|Utilizing {{techniques}} and relying on skills culled from over 25 {{years of training}} and 50 years practice in the arts, Bonifacho works in {{the medium of oil}} which he applies to large squares and rectangles of prepared canvas. On occasion, he has also used encaustic for its tactility and luminosity. Periodically, Bonifacho has focused on qualities of geometry, surface, gesture, and sgraffito in <b>metallic</b> <b>paints</b> as a relief from working with prismatic colour. His work is represented by the Bau Xi Gallery in Toronto and Vancouver (Canada), the Foster/White Gallery in Seattle (US), and the Herringer Kiss Gallery in Calgary (Canada).|$|R
