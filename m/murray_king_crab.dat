40|$|Barents Sea {{ecosystem}} is limited. Due to {{the information}} available on benthos the Ecopath model of Sørfjord, Northern Norway, was used to investigate possible trophic changes with introduction of <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> to the model. A literature study of the <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> was conducted to find information on diet, mortality, consumption rate and other life history parameters required by the model. A short introduction to biological invasions was also included. The Ecopath with Ecosim software {{was used as a}} modelling tool to investigate factors allowing for growth of <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> as well as potentially controlling their biomass. Possible food-web effects of <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> invasion on the Sørfjord ecosystem was also investigated. Knowledge gaps identified through the exercise and management implications were discussed. A biomass of 1. 2 t km- 2 small and 2. 8 t km- 2 large <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> was introduced to the Sørfjord model. The modelling exercise indicated that a resource opportunity, in the form of benthic production, could allow for growth of the <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> in Sørfjord. Mammals could {{have a negative impact on}} large <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> abundance through predation, while fish predation is expected to have minor effects on <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> biomass. King crabs are expected to have a negative effect on the benthic community through predation, but limited impact on the pelagic community. King crab abundance could be controlled by fishing large <b>king</b> <b>crabs.</b> A change in fishing of other commercial fish species is not expected to have an impact on <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> biomass.

40|$|Abstract only. The red <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> (Paralithodes camtschaticus) is {{an alien}} {{invasive}} {{species in the}} Barents Sea representing a value {{as well as a}} potential pest. A bio-economic model is applied analysing the costs that traditional fisheries incur {{as a result of the}} <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> invasion, as well as the income from <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> harvest. Since the impact of the <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> on the native species is not known, bycatch costs in traditional fisheries were used as a proxy for cost related to the invasion. The model suggests that the <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> stock should be reduced in order to optimize the profit of the total fishery. The model is robust to changes in input parameters. Large uncertainties related to the costs of the <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> invasion, however, illustrate the need to improve our knowledge with regards to the effect of the <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> on the traditional fishery as well as the native ecosystem...|$|R

50|$|One {{environmental}} parameter {{that requires}} regulatory {{function of the}} red <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> is the season due to the temperature change. Mature female red <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> must remain in warmer water (near 4 °C) to ensure the eggs {{will be ready for}} hatching, while the male red <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> stay in relatively cold water (near 1.5 °C) to conserve energy output. In spring (May), female red <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> move to shallow coastal areas to moult and spawn, and males join the females in the shallow water prior to moulting. In the summer (mid-June through mid-November), these crabs spend their time in fairly deep water, below established summer thermocline. When the thermocline breaks down, the red <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> migrate back to intermediate depths where they remain until the female red <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> release the eggs fertilized in the previous spawning.|$|R
50|$|Blue <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> can {{be found}} in the Bering Sea in {{relatively}} small abundances compared to red <b>king</b> <b>crabs.</b> The main populations near Alaska are found near the Diomede Islands, Point Hope, St. Matthew Island, and the Pribilof Islands. Additionally, populations exist in the Norton Sound all the way to the St. Lawrence Islands. There are smaller populations located off the eastern coast of Asia, near northern Japan and Siberia. Blue <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> have a more northerly distribution compared to red <b>king</b> <b>crabs,</b> which is due to the colder waters of the northern Bering Sea being suitable for blue <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> to survive. The unique population locations of the blue <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> are a result from glacial interactions with the water temperature of the Bering Sea. A period of increased temperature limited the spread of cold-water species, pushing the species further northward into the depths of the Bering Sea. Not only did blue <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> retreat to the northern stretches of the Bering Sea, but they also had a possible population shrinkage due to glacial epochs.|$|R

50|$|Overall, the red <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> {{have a high}} {{adaptation}} {{capacity in}} changes of salinity level because the crabs retain their vital functions and also their feeding locomotor activities. However, {{there is a difference}} in the salinity tolerance between juvenile red <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> and adult red <b>king</b> <b>crabs.</b> Juvenile red <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> are slightly more tolerant to low concentrations of salinity because the juvenile's volume regulation is significantly better. Juveniles are consistently hyposmotic to the seawater because they have lower sodium concentration in their hemolymph. Due to the smaller size of the juveniles their exoskeleton is structurally more rigid. The adult red <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> are hyperosmotic in high salinity and becomes hyposmotic in lower salinity. The hyperosmoticity is due to the higher sodium and potassium concentrations in the hemolymph compared to the surrounding water they live in.|$|R
50|$|Red (P. camtschaticus) {{and blue}} (P. platypus) <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> {{are some of}} the most {{important}} fisheries in Alaska, however populations have fluctuated in the past 25 years and some areas are currently closed due to overfishing. The two species are similar in size, shape and life history. Habitat is the main factor separating the range of blue and red <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> in the Bering Sea. Red <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> prefer shallow, muddy or sandy habitats in Bristol Bay and Norton Sound, while blue <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> prefer the deeper areas made up of cobble, gravel and rock that occur around the Pribilof, St. Matthew, St. Lawrence and the Diomede Islands.|$|R
40|$|Molecular {{evidence}} has established that <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> (Lithodinae) are gigantic hermit crabs without a gastropod shell {{to protect their}} abdomen. Secondarily, the abdomen has become calcified and flexed, in a crab-like manner. As a result, <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> are superficially resembling brachyuran (true) <b>crabs.</b> Both <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> and hermit crabs are parasitized by parasitic barnacles (Rhizocephala), which are an exclusively parasitic taxon belonging to the Cirripedia. Rhizocephalans are highly adapted to their parasitic lifestyle. Being irreversibly bound to their host, the parasites have extremely intimate relationships with their host taxa. In this thesis, the coevolutionary interplay between <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> and parasitic barnacles has been investigated, to test, if the fascinating evolutionary origin of <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> from a hermit crab ancestor can also be traced via the coevolution with their parasitic barnacles. To resolve the exact placement of <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> within the hermit crabs and identify the closest extant relatives to the Lithodinae, a phylogenetic tree of hermit <b>crabs</b> and <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> was constructed via Bayesian Inference and Maximum Likelihood analyses. To achieve this goal, multiple molecular markers of mitochondrial and nuclear ribosomal genes were utilized in combination with extensive taxon sampling. Further, a molecular phylogenetic tree of parasitic barnacles from numerous hermit <b>crabs</b> and <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> was produced. The phylogeny of parasitic barnacles was subsequently linked to the phylogenetic tree of hermit <b>crabs</b> and <b>king</b> <b>crabs,</b> via individual hostparasite associations. Cophylogeny analyses of the dataset revealed that the parasites closely followed their hosts in a coevolutionary manner, where the speciation of a host lineage {{is accompanied by a}} parallel diversification of the parasite lineage. The evolution of <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> was accompanied by two independent parasite lineages which followed the evolution of <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> from a hermit crab ancestor. The host-parasite cophylogeny analyses strongly corroborated the phylogenetic placement of <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> within the hermit crab family Paguridae. Hermit crabs were known to host a number of parasitic barnacle species, but only one species had been reported as a parasite of <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> prior to this study. This parasite was supposed to parasitize a wide range of species, with a global distribution spanning all oceans. Detailed investigation of rhizocephalan parasites of <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> revealed that the previously recognized single species constitutes of a rather large complex of cryptic species, each specialized to only one or few hosts. These cryptic species, of which two species new to science were described in this thesis, however, are difficult, or even impossible, to distinguish by morphology alone. Rhizocephala solely rely on their host for nutrition. Due to their parasitic lifestyle they have evolved a highly modified morphology compared to other crustaceans, lacking almost all arthropod features like segmentation, a centralized nervous system, any alimentary tract, or appendages. The adult morphology of the female parasite can be divided into two distinct parts: a sac-shaped reproductive body which is attached to the outside of the host, called the externa; and a trophic part situated inside the host, the interna, which has a root-like appearance. The interna infiltrates the inner organs as a complicated mycelia-like structure that spreads throughout the body of the host. Its location, hidden inside the host’s body, and highly structured morphology, makes this part of the organism difficult to study. Using state of the art X-ray micro computer tomography (MicroCT) and computer-aided 3 Dreconstruction, the spatial organization of this root system inside the intact host was documented for parasites of <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> and hermit crabs to investigate the parasite’s adaption to a highly changed morphology in their hosts, due to the process of carcinization in the Lithodinae. Results of this thesis are further used to evaluate the potential danger of the Northeast Atlantic red <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> population to become parasitized by a rhizocephalan parasite, with potential damaging effects for the fisheries industry. The red <b>king</b> <b>crab,</b> Paralithodes camtschaticus, is frequently parasitized by rhizocephalans in its native range, the North Pacific, but the introduced red <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> stock in the North Atlantic is rhizocephalan-free. The parasite grows an extensive system of green rootlets inside the <b>crab,</b> making infested <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> unusable for marketing. The parasite further sterilizes its host, with a potential highly negative effect on population size and significant economic impact on the <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> fisheries. </p...|$|R
50|$|King crabs are {{generally}} {{thought to be}} derived from hermit crab-like ancestors, which may explain the asymmetry still found in the adult forms. This ancestry is supported by several anatomical peculiarities which are present only in <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> and hermit crabs. Although some doubt still exists about this theory, <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> are the most widely quoted example of carcinisation among the Decapoda. The evidence for this explanation comes from the asymmetry of the <b>king</b> <b>crab's</b> abdomen, which is thought to reflect the asymmetry of hermit crabs, which must fit into a spiral shell. Although formerly classified among the hermit crabs in the superfamily Paguroidea, <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> are now placed in a separate superfamily, Lithodoidea. This is not without controversy as there is a widespread consensus in the scientific community that <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> are derived from hermit crabs and closely related to pagurid hermit crabs, and therefore a separate superfamily in the classification poorly reflects the phylogenetic relationship of this taxon.|$|R

As post-spawn capelin occurred more frequently in crab stomachs than capelin eggs, they might have served as alternative prey to capelin eggs. Average stomach evacuation time for lumpsucker in red <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> was higher than for capelin eggs. Consumption estimates of capelin eggs in red <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> accounted for 0. 04 % and 2. 23 % of the eggs available in the years of study, while the minimum estimated mortality due to egg cannibalism in capelin accounted for 1 - 2 % of the total egg production in 2003.

Mortality in capelin eggs caused by cannibalism and egg consumption by the red <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> may influence mortality of eggs, but is not considered to hamper capelin recruitment.

40|$|Biological invasions {{are a major}} {{challenge}} facing coastal waters and increasingly threaten high-latitude environments. The red <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> {{is one of the}} world’s largest decapods and was introduced into the Barents Sea in the 1960 s. It has since become a valuable fishery resource in Russian and Norwegian waters. In the early 2000 s, red <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> entered Porsangerfjord, which now holds one of the largest densities of <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> along the northern Norwegian coast. This thesis provides new knowledge on how predation by the red <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> may effect benthic community, productivity and the food web in Porsangerfjorden. The major objectives of this thesis were to assess macrobenthic communities and their secondary production in Porsangerfjord, and, together with information on the trophic niche, asses the role of the red <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> in the food web and its predation and competitive impacts through Ecopath with Ecosim mass balance models (EwE). Benthic communities in Porsangerfjord followed environmental and predation gradients, which affected community traits, such as composition and size structure, resulting in different production and P/B patterns. The red <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> is a generalist, opportunistic predator, feeding on multiple trophic levels. Small and large crabs are likely to affect different habitats and prey species, but took a similar trophic position in the food web. The red <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> {{played an important role in}} the Porsangerfjord food web through top-down effects on large, long-lived benthic invertebrate groups by medium and large sized crabs, but had little significance as prey for higher trophic levels and affected mostly the benthic compartment of the food web. Niche overlap and competitive effects with fish species were comparably low, but those may be of significance for birds feeding on benthic invertebrates and for large predatory invertebrates, the latter also being prey for red <b>king</b> <b>crabs.</b> In the future, <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> may partly replace these invertebrates as major predator in the benthos. Predation pressure by the red <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> may be buffered by high production in some prey, such as polychaetes, but may lead benthic communities to an overall lower biomass and higher turnover system, with unknown consequences for ecosystem stability and resilience. King crabs may help in the regrowth of macroalgae through predation on herbivorous sea urchins, but this needs further investigation and implementation in future models...|$|R
