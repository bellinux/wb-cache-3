40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the design of a self-scheduled current controller for doubly fed induction machines. The design is based on the framework of linear parameter-varying systems where the <b>mechanical</b> angular <b>speed</b> {{is considered to be a}} measurable time-varying parameter. The objective is to obtain robust dynamic performance for all variations of the <b>mechanical</b> rotor <b>speed</b> in a specified operating range. Employing the benefits of digital control, a continuous-to-discrete time transformation is utilized to replace the continuous-time current controller by an approximating discrete-time controller. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the performance and robustness of the controlled system with respect to changes of the <b>mechanical</b> rotor <b>speed</b> and against stator voltage dips...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{significant}} results of the experimental research of current harmonic spectrum of traction drive with permanent magnet synchronous motor. The experiments were done on a special workplace with a real traction drive for wheel vehicles. Current harmonic spectrum was analyzed by a specialized device {{on the base of}} central measuring station. The knowledge of current marked subharmonic components of stator winding is the most significant finding of experiments. The frequencies of these components are given by multiples of frequency of <b>mechanical</b> <b>speeds.</b> The subharmonic components also pass to input DC current of drive.

Since the Yonezawa onboard electronics {{did not have a}} battery eliminator circuit, it was necessary to install four [...] "AA" [...] alkaline batteries in addition to the supplied 7.2-volt, 1200mAh nickel cadmium battery pack for the Mabuchi RS-540 drive motor.|$|E
50|$|It was {{designed}} as a contender with the Tamiya Clod Buster which was released two years earlier. Both were 4WD monster trucks with four wheel steering and four wheel drive using twin motors, one to each gearbox. Both trucks used a single servo to steer and another to run a heavy duty <b>mechanical</b> <b>speed</b> controller, so they were easily controlled with a common two channel radio. Both trucks came with a set of eight friction type shocks and 27 turn RS-540 motors.|$|E
50|$|The servo-actuated three step <b>mechanical</b> <b>speed</b> control {{features}} a resistor {{with a metal}} mounting bracket for heat dissipation, and is wired for a single 7.2V battery pack. A transmitter, receiver, and a minimum of one servo for steering and one servo for throttle are required to complete the truck. An enticing feature is Tamiya includes two bodies: one is pre-painted as represented on the box art, while the second is left clear with an overspray film for custom painting schemes. Unfortunately, only one set of decals is included.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} obtain the {{optimized}} manual uprooted speed model of cassava root and the <b>mechanical</b> optimized uprooted <b>speed</b> model, the acceleration curves of cassava root uprooting of the experienced farmers are tested and the changing laws of the curves are studied by statistical analysis and nonlinear fitting method. Then, the optimized manual uprooted speed model is selected by the laws and based on it the <b>mechanical</b> optimized uprooted <b>speed</b> model is established. The {{results show that the}} optimized manual uprooted speed model is high nonlinearity, but root dithering accompanies the process of uprooting. The speed variation curves can be superimposed by line and sine curve or concave downward parabola and sine curve. The latter is selected as the form of the <b>mechanical</b> optimized uprooted <b>speed</b> model for reducing power consumption and harvest losses...|$|R

Since the second half of the twentieth century, sailors continue to use more modern mechanical and electro-mechanical versions based upon a small impeller or paddle wheel attached to (or through) the bottom of the hull, especially on smaller yachts.|$|E
5000|$|Traxxas first {{introduced}} the 4-tec in 1998 {{and it is}} Traxxas' 1/10 four-wheel drive scale electric touring car. The 4-tec shares a few parts with the Nitro 4-tec, like the shocks, springs, wheels and the belt drive four-wheel drive system is similar. The chassis however is all nylon composite instead of aluminum and the transmission is a single speed unit. The 4-tec {{is powered by a}} [...] "Stinger" [...] 540 20 turn motor and uses either a 3-speed rotary <b>mechanical</b> <b>speed</b> control or a fully proportional XL-1 ESC (first offered in 2005).

5000|$|... {{where is}} stator {{electrical}} speed, [...] is rotor <b>mechanical</b> <b>speed.</b> [...] Slip, which varies from zero at synchronous speed and 1 when the rotor is at rest, determines the motor's torque. Since the short-circuited rotor windings have small resistance, {{even a small}} slip induces a large current in the rotor and produces significant torque. [...] At full rated load, slip varies from more than 5% for small or special purpose motors to less than 1% for large motors. [...] These speed variations can cause load-sharing problems when differently sized motors are mechanically connected. [...] Various methods are available to reduce slip, VFDs often offering the best solution.|$|E

40|$|Despite their {{ever-increasing}} {{power injection}} into power grid, wind turbines play {{no role in}} frequency control. On the other hand, power network frequency is mainly adjusted by conventional power plants. DFIG-based wind turbines not only are able to produce power in various <b>mechanical</b> <b>speeds,</b> {{but they can also}} reduce speed instantaneously which, in turn, leads to mechanical energy release. Thus, they can aid conventional units in system frequency control. In this paper, the effect of wind energy conversion systems, especially variable speed DFIG-based wind turbines, in controlling and tuning of frequency is investigated when different penetration coefficients are considered in a isolated microgrid comprising of conventional thermal and non-thermal generating unit. To do this, optimal tuning of DFIG's speed controller is performed in different penetration levels using particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique. In addition, optimum penetration of wind energy conversion system is studied considering frequency change parameters in a microgrid...|$|R
50|$|The term {{correctly}} {{applies only}} to systems where the feedback or error-correction signals help control <b>mechanical</b> position, <b>speed</b> or other parameters. For example, an automotive power window control is not a servomechanism, {{as there is no}} automatic feedback that controls position—the operator does this by observation. By contrast a car's cruise control uses closed-loop feedback, which classifies it as a servomechanism.|$|R

Tires were wide, chevron-treaded implement-styled units and actually comprised the majority of the Big Bear's suspension. The shock absorbers were simple coilover units which allowed for limited suspension travel. Coil springs also served to hold the front bumper in place and absorb impact. The body was a highly detailed styrene plastic Datsun pickup with driver figure and [...] "Big Bear" [...] decal set.|$|E
5000|$|Marui made {{a special}} {{replacement}} part [...] "#048 - Strengthened Differential Gear Set" [...] {{that consisted of}} a tri-bevel differential, larger 32 pitch gears, and a change to the gear ratios. This new differential gear set {{found its way into}} the re-release of the Big Bear (v.2) coupled with a new heat sink plate between the gearbox halves. There were some draw backs to the new gears; The added torque of the new gear ratios made the truck do wheelies more easily, and made the truck a little slower. In addition to replacement gears and heat sink, Marui replaced the original M480-RS motor with an RS540-SH motor, and a redesigned <b>mechanical</b> <b>speed</b> controller with covered contacts to eliminate contamination.|$|E
50|$|The truck, {{available}} {{only as a}} kit, comes equipped with twin 540-J size sealed endbell stock motors wired in parallel when using the standard <b>mechanical</b> <b>speed</b> control. The motors feed power through a closed gear-reduction transmission terminating in a single dual-end output shaft which subsequently turn metal telescoping driveshafts running to each axle. The two axles feature the additional bracing and updated gear arrangement and specifications of the Juggernaut 2 truck which improve durability and lifespan while reducing the chance of gear misalignment under large torque loads. The 12mm hex {{at the end of}} each axle shaft keys into a widened 5-hole hub akin to the Clod Buster hub to increase track width. Main stress-bearing internal gear shafts in the transmission and axles are supported by metal shielded bearings, while the rest of the gears in the truck spin on metal bushings.|$|E
