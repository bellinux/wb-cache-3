5000|$|Digital fuel injection, {{introduced}} for California bound 1982 Volvo 240 models. The 'LH' {{stands for}} [...] "Luftmasse-Hitzdraht" [...] - the hotwire anemometer technology {{used to determine}} the mass of air into the engine. This air <b>mass</b> <b>meter</b> is called HLM2 (Hitzdraht-LuftMassenmesser 2) by Bosch. The LH-Jetronic was mostly used by Scandinavian car manufacturers, and by sports and luxury cars produced in small quantities, such as Porsche 928. The most common variants are LH 2.2, which uses an Intel 8049 (MCS-48) microcontroller, and usually a 4 kB programme memory, and LH 2.4, which uses a Siemens 80535 microcontroller (a variant of Intel's 8051/MCS-51 architecture) and 32 kB programme memory based on the 27C256 chip. LH-Jetronic 2.4 has adaptive lambda control, and support for a variety of advanced features; including fuel enrichment based on exhaust gas temperature (ex. Volvo B204GT/B204FT engines). Some later (post-1995) versions contain hardware support for first generation diagnostics according to ISO 9141 (a.k.a. OBD-II) and immobiliser functions.|$|E

40|$|A fuel {{injection}} engine {{in a vehicle}} requires a good air flow to sustain high performance. The air is supplied by the air filter system and the flow though the system is measured by an air <b>mass</b> <b>meter.</b> Volvo performs CFD analysis on the air filter system using a procedure to find pressure loss and flow uniformity index. This thesis presents two CFD procedures designed to improve analysis {{of these types of}} systems. The first is dedicated to predicting the flow through the air mass flow sensor present in the system. Experiments show that at low mass flows the air <b>mass</b> <b>meter</b> signal is affected by a noise. Current simulation procedures cannot predict this noise and a new procedure were needed. The procedure developed could not find the signal noise but {{can be used as a}} basis for a future transient analysis procedure at Volvo. The second is an optimization procedure designed to find the optimal design for any given geometries in the system with respect to pressure losses and flow uniformity index. The optimization procedure showed promise in finding optimal designs and will be of used in future development. The procedures are tested and developed on existing air filter systems. Experiments were performed with the system in a flow rig and verified the simulated results. Validerat; 20110725 (anonymous...|$|E

40|$|The work {{performed}} {{was an attempt}} {{to reduce the amount of}} produced water by using the well bore as an oil-water separator. The use of a flow meter, density meter and/or conductivity meter controlling a pumping unit would be used to achieve this goal. The natural physical differences between oil and water are easily detected inside the production stream with proper equipment. A coriolis <b>mass</b> <b>meter,</b> conductivity meter, data recorder, timer and relays were purchased and housed in a purpose-built field cabinet. The metering unit was hooked to four wells over the course of the project, Spencer No. 8, Applegate Gray Unit No. 1 (AGU No. 1), Vollmer No. 4 and Mohr No. 1. All are located in the Illinois Basin, three with artificial lift pumps and one flowing well. Depth of producing formations ranges from a maximum of 846. 13 m (2776 ft) to minimum of 316. 69 m (1039 ft). All wells were completed in one formation of Mississippian or Pennsylvanian age. The data recorded were analyzed to determine what events could be detected. Events included pure oil or higher oil-cut fluid reaching the pump or reaching the metering equipment, the pump operating under capacity, and the well ''pumped down''. Based on how much oil and water is present in a fluid column, the pressure the fluid column imparts on a formation can be calculated. By knowing the amount of oil and water in a well bore and the maximum height water can reach, production equipment can be configured to only produce oil. However, the configuration may not be profitable. It became apparent during the course of this research the wells tested do not have an oil-water contact deep enough so traditional pumping equipment can be configured to recover oil by the proposed method. This method may work more successfully in deeper basins. Other interesting anomalies were also detected in the data...|$|E

40|$|In the {{capillary}} type thermal <b>mass</b> flow <b>meter</b> {{the sensor}} {{is a small}} diameter stainless steel or constantan capillary, heated by an electric current. The heat is supplied either at the central point or over the whole length of the tube. In the absence of gas flow, the temperature profile is symmetric about the mid point. Gas flow through the capillary tube cools the entry section while heating the exit. This introduces an asymmetry in the temperature profile, which {{is a measure of}} the fluid flow rate. The asymmetry is measured in terms of difference of temperature between two suitably chosen points on the capillary tube, which are equidistant from the mid point on opposite sides. This temperature difference is a function of the direction and rate of mass flow of the fluid.
