These blocked themselves out, huge enough, but without any special terror, while the glorious ritual of the Eastern dawn went forward. Some reed of the bank revealed itself by reflection, black on silver; arched wings flapped and jarred the still water to splintered glass; the desert ridge turned to topaz, and the four figures stood clear, yet without shadowing, from their background. The stronger light flooded them red from head to foot, and they became alive--as horridly and tensely yet blindly alive as pinioned men in the death-chair before the current is switched on.

60|$|A plan of Favouritism for our {{executory}} Government {{is essentially}} {{at variance with}} the plan of our Legislature. One great end undoubtedly of a mixed Government like ours, composed of Monarchy, and of controls, {{on the part of}} the higher people and the lower, is that the Prince shall not be able to violate the laws. This is useful indeed and fundamental. But this, even at first view, is no more than a negative advantage; an armour merely defensive. It is therefore next in order, and equal in importance, that the discretionary powers which are necessarily vested in the Monarch, whether for the execution of the laws, or for the nomination to magistracy and office, or for conducting the affairs of peace and war, or for ordering the revenue, should all be exercised upon public principles and national grounds, and not on the likings or prejudices, the intrigues or policies of a Court. This, I said, is equal in importance to the securing a Government according to law. The laws reach but a very little way. Constitute Government how you please, infinitely the greater part of it must depend upon the exercise of the powers which are left at large to the prudence and uprightness of Ministers of State. Even all the use and potency of the laws depends upon them. Without them, your Commonwealth is no better than a scheme upon paper; and not a living, active, effective constitution. It is possible, that through negligence, or ignorance, or design artfully conducted, Ministers may suffer one part of Government to languish, another to be perverted from its purposes: and every valuable interest of the country to fall into ruin and decay, without possibility of fixing any single act on which a criminal prosecution can be justly grounded. The due arrangement of men in the active part of the state, far from being foreign to the purposes of a wise Government, ought to be among its very first and dearest objects. When, therefore, the abettors of new system tell us, that between them and their opposers there is nothing but a struggle for power, and that therefore we are no-ways concerned in it; we must tell those who have the impudence to insult us in this manner, that, of all things, we ought to be the most concerned, who and what sort of men they are, that hold the trust of everything that is dear to us. Nothing can render this a point of indifference to the nation, but what must either render us totally desperate, or soothe us into the security of idiots. We must soften into a credulity below the <b>milkiness</b> of infancy, to think all men virtuous. We must be tainted with a malignity truly diabolical, to believe all the world to be equally wicked and corrupt. Men are in public life as in private--some good, some evil.

6000|$|It {{was on the}} 16th of May, 18-- that we left Naples {{at three}} in the morning for the purpose of visiting the remains of the temples of Paestum, and having {{provided}} relays of horses we found ourselves at about half- past one o'clock descending the hill of Eboli towards the plain which contains these stupendous monuments of antiquity. Were my existence to be prolonged through ten centuries, I think I could never forget the pleasure I received on that delicious spot. We alighted from our carriage to take some refreshment, and we reposed upon the herbage under the shade of a magnificent pine contemplating the view around and below us. On the right were the green hills covered with trees stretching towards Salerno; beyond them were the marble cliffs which form the southern extremity of the Bay of Sorento; immediately below our feet was a rich and cultivated country filled with vineyards and abounding in villas, in the gardens of which were seen the olive and the cypress tree connected as if to memorialise how near to each other are life and death, joy and sorrow; the distant mountains stretching beyond the plain of Paestum were in the full luxuriance of vernal vegetation; and in the extreme distance, as if in the midst of a desert, we saw the white temples glittering in the sunshine. The blue Tyrrhene sea filled up the outline of this scene, which, though so beautiful, was not calm; there was a heavy breeze which blew full from the southwest; it was literally a zephyr, and its freshness and strength in the middle of the day were peculiarly balmy and delightful; it seemed a breath stolen by the spring from the summer. I never saw a deeper, brighter azure than that of the waves which rolled towards the shore, and which was rendered more striking by the pure whiteness of their foam. The agitation of nature seemed to be one of breathing and awakening life; the noise made by the waving of the branches of the pine above our heads and by the rattling of its cones was overpowered by the music of a multitude of birds which sung everywhere in the trees that surrounded us, and the cooing of the turtle- doves was heard even more distinctly than the murmuring of the waves or the whistling of the winds, so that in the strife of nature the voice of love was predominant. With our hearts touched by this extraordinary scene we descended to the ruins, and having taken at a farmhouse a person who acted as guide or cicerone, we began to examine those wonderful remains which have outlived even the name of the people by whom they were raised, and which continue almost perfect whilst a Roman and a Saracen city since raised have been destroyed. We had been walking for half an hour round the temples in the sunshine when our guide represented to us the danger that there was of suffering from the effects of malaria, for which, as is well known, this place is notorious, and advised us to retire into the interior of the temple of Neptune. We followed his advice, and my companions began to employ themselves in measuring the circumference of one of the Doric columns, when they suddenly called my attention to a stranger who was sitting on a camp-stool behind it. The appearance of any person in this place at this time was sufficiently remarkable, but the man who was before us from his dress and appearance would have been remarkable anywhere. He was employed in writing in a memorandum book when we first saw him, but he immediately rose and saluted us by bending the head slightly though gracefully; and this enabled me to see distinctly his person and dress. He was rather above the middle stature, slender, but with well-turned limbs; his countenance was remarkably intelligent, his eye hazel but full and strong, his front was smooth and unwrinkled, and but for some grey hairs, which appeared silvering his brown and curly locks, he might have been supposed to have hardly reached the middle age; his nose was aquiline, the expression of the lower part of his countenance remarkably sweet, and when he spoke to our guide, which he did with uncommon fluency in the Neapolitan dialect, I thought I had never heard a more agreeable voice, sonorous yet gentle and silver-sounded. His dress was very peculiar, almost like that of an ecclesiastic, but coarse and light; and there was a large soiled white hat on the ground beside him, on which was fastened a pilgrim's cockle shell, and there was suspended round his neck a long antique blue enamelled phial, like those found in the Greek tombs, and it was attached to a rosary of coarse beads. He took up his hat, and appeared to be retiring to another part of the building, when I apologised for the interruption we had given to his studies, begged him to resume them, and assured him that our stay in the building would be only momentary, for I saw that there was a cloud over the sun, the brightness of which was the cause of our retiring. I spoke in Italian; he replied in English, observing that he supposed the fear of contracting the malaria fever had induced us to seek the shelter of the shade: but it is too early in the season to have much reasonable fear of this insidious enemy; yet, he added, this bottle which you may have observed here at my breast, I carry about with me, as a supposed preventive of the effects of malaria, and as far as my experience, a very limited one, however, has gone, it is effectual. I ventured to ask him what the bottle might contain, as such a benefit ought to be made known to the world. He replied, [...] "It is a mixture which slowly produces the substance called by chemists chlorine, which is well known to be generally destructive to contagious matters; and a friend of mine who has lived for many years in Italy, and who has made a number of experiments with it, by exposing himself to the danger of fever in the worst seasons and in the worst places, believes that it is a secure preventive. I am not convinced of this; but it can do no harm; and in waiting for more evidence of its utility, I employ it without putting the least confidence in its power; nor do I expose myself to the same danger as my friend has done for the sake of an experiment." [...] I said, [...] "I believe several scientific persons--Brocchi amongst others--have doubted the existence of any specific matter in the atmosphere producing intermittent fevers in marshy countries and hot climates; and have been more disposed to attribute the disease to physical causes, dependent upon the great differences of temperature between day and night and to the refrigerating effects of the dense fogs common in such situations in the evening and morning; and, on this hypothesis, they have recommended warm woollen clothing and fires at night as the best preventives against these destructive diseases, so fatal to the peasants who remain in the summer and autumn in the neighbourhood of the maremme of Rome, Tuscany, or Naples." [...] The stranger said, [...] "I am acquainted with the opinions of the gentlemen, and they undoubtedly have weight; but that a specific matter of contagion has not been detected by chemical means in the atmosphere of marshes does not prove its non-existence. We know so little of those agents that affect the human constitution, that it is of no use to reason on this subject. There can be no doubt that the line of malaria above the Pontine marshes is marked by a dense fog morning and evening, and most of the old Roman towns were placed upon eminences out of the reach of this fog. I have myself experienced a peculiar effect upon the organs of smell in the neighbourhood of marshes in the evening after a very hot day; and the instances in which people have been seized with intermittents by a single exposure in a place infested by malaria in the season of fevers gives, I think, a strong support to something like a poisonous material existing in the atmosphere in such spots; but I merely offer doubts. I hope the progress of physiology and of chemistry will at no very distant time solve this important problem." [...] Ambrosio now came forward, and bowing to the stranger, said he took the liberty, as he saw from his familiarity with the cicerone that he was well acquainted with Paestum, of asking him whether the masses of travertine, of which the Cyclopean walls and the temples were formed, were really produced by aqueous deposition from the River Silaro, as he had often heard reported. The stranger replied, [...] "that they were certainly produced by deposition from water; and such deposits are made by the Silaro. But I rather believe," [...] he said, [...] "that a lake in the immediate neighbourhood of the city furnished the quarry from which these stones were excavated; and, in half an hour, if you like, after you have finished your examinations of the temples with your guide, I will accompany you to the spot from which it is evident that large masses of the travertine, marmor tiburtinum, or calcareous tufa, have been raised." [...] We thanked him for his attention, accepted his invitation, took the usual walk round the temples, and returned to our new acquaintance, who led the way through the gate of the city to the banks of a pool or lake a short distance off. We walked to the borders on a mass of calcareous tufa, and we saw that this substance had even encrusted the reeds on the shore. There was something peculiarly melancholy in the character of this water; all the herbs around it were grey, as if encrusted with marble; a few buffaloes were slaking their thirst in it, which ran wildly away on our approach, and appeared to retire into a rocky excavation or quarry at the end of the lake; there were a number of birds, which, on examination, I found were sea swallows, flitting on the surface and busily employed with the libella or dragon- fly in destroying the myriads of gnats which rose from the bottom and were beginning to be very troublesome by their bites to us. [...] "There," [...] said the stranger, [...] "is what I believe to be the source of those large and durable stones which you see in the plain before you. This water rapidly deposits calcareous matter, and even if you throw a stick into it, a few hours is sufficient to give it a coating of this substance. Whichever way you turn your eyes you see masses of this recently-produced marble, the consequence of the overflowing of the lake during the winter floods, and in that large excavation where you saw the buffaloes disappear you may observe that immense masses have been removed, as if by the hand of art and in remote times. The marble that remains in the quarry is of the same texture and character as that which you see in the ruins of Paestum, and I think it is scarcely possible to doubt that the builders of those extraordinary structures derived a part of their materials from this spot." [...] Ambrosio gave his assent to this opinion of the stranger; and I took the liberty of asking him as to the quantity of calcareous matter contained in solution in the lake, saying that it appeared to me, for so rapid and considerable an effect of deposition, there must be an unusual quantity of solid matter dissolved by the water or some peculiar circumstance of solution. The stranger replied, [...] "This water is like many, I may say most of the sources which rise at the foot of the Apennines: it holds carbonic acid in solution which has dissolved a portion of the calcareous matter of the rock through which it has passed. This carbonic acid is dissipated in the atmosphere, and the marble, slowly thrown down, assumes a crystalline form and produces coherent stones. The lake before us is not particularly rich in the quantity of calcareous matter that it contains, for, as I have found by experience, a pint of it does not afford more than five or six grains; but the quantity of fluid and the length of time are sufficient to account for the immense quantities of tufa and rock which in the course of ages have accumulated in this situation." [...] Onuphrio's curiosity was excited by this statement of the stranger, and he said, [...] "May I take the liberty of asking if you have any idea as to the cause of the large quantity of carbonic acid which you have been so good as to inform us exists in most of the waters in this country?" [...] The stranger replied, [...] "I certainly have formed an opinion on this subject, which I willingly state to you. It can, I think, be scarcely doubted that there is a source of volcanic fire at no great distance from the surface in the whole of southern Italy; and, this fire acting upon the calcareous rocks of which the Apennines are composed, must constantly detach from them carbonic acid, which rising to the sources of the springs, deposited from the waters of the atmosphere, must give them their impregnation and enable them to dissolve calcareous matter. I need not dwell upon Etna, Vesuvius, or the Lipari Islands to prove that volcanic fires are still in existence; and there can be no doubt that in earlier periods almost the whole of Italy was ravaged by them; oven Rome itself, the eternal city, rests upon the craters of extinct volcanoes; and I imagine that the traditional and fabulous record of the destruction made by the conflagration of Phaeton in the chariot of the sun and his falling into the Po had reference to a great and tremendous igneous volcanic eruption, which extended over Italy and ceased only near the Po at the foot of the Alps. Be this as it may, the sources of carbonic acid are numerous, not merely in the Neapolitan, but likewise in the Roman and Tuscan states. The most magnificent waterfall in Europe, that of the Velino, near Terni, is partly fed by a stream containing calcareous matter dissolved by carbonic acid, and it deposits marble, which crystallises even in the midst of its thundering descent and foam in the bed in which it falls. The Anio or Teverone, which almost approaches in beauty to the Velino in the number and variety of its falls and cascatelle, is likewise a calcareous water; and there is still a more remarkable one which empties itself into this river below Tivoli, and which you have probably seen in your excursions in the campagna of Rome, called the lacus Albula or the lake of the Solfatara." [...] Ambrosio said, [...] "We remember it well, we saw it this very spring; we were carried there to examine some ancient Roman baths, and we were struck by the blue <b>milkiness</b> of the water, by the magnitude of the source, and by the disagreeable smell of sulphuretted hydrogen which everywhere surrounded the lake." [...] The stranger said, [...] "When you return to Latium I advise you to pay another visit to a spot which is interesting from a number of causes, some of which I will take the liberty of mentioning to you. You have only seen one lake, that where the ancient Romans erected their baths, but there is another a few yards above it, surrounded by very high rushes, and almost hidden by them from the sight. This lake sends down a considerable stream of tepid water to the larger lake, but this water is less strongly impregnated with carbonic acid; the largest lake is actually a saturated solution of this gas, which escapes from it in such quantities in some parts of its surface that it has the appearance of being actually in ebullition. I have found by experiment that the water taken from the most tranquil part of the lake, even after being agitated and exposed to the air, contained in solution more than its own volume of carbonic acid gas with a very small quantity of sulphuretted hydrogen, to the presence of which, I conclude, its ancient use in curing cutaneous disorders may be referred. Its temperature, I ascertained, was in the winter in the warmest parts above 80 degrees of Fahrenheit, and it appears to be pretty constant, for I have found it differ a few degrees only, in the ascending source, in January, March, May, and the beginning of June; it is therefore supplied with heat from a subterraneous source, being nearly twenty degrees above the mean temperature of the atmosphere. Kircher has detailed in his [...] "Mundus Subterraneus" [...] various wonders respecting this lake, most of which are unfounded, such as that it is unfathomable, that it has at the bottom the heat of boiling water, and that floating islands rise from the gulf which emits it. It must certainly be very difficult, or even impossible, to fathom a source which rises with so much violence from a subterraneous excavation, and, at a time when chemistry had made small progress, it was easy to mistake the disengagement of carbonic acid for an actual ebullition. The floating islands are real, but neither the Jesuit nor any of the writers who have since described this lake had a correct idea of their origin, which is exceedingly curious. The high temperature of this water, and the quantity of carbonic acid that it contains, render it peculiarly fitted to afford a pabulum or nourishment to vegetable life. The banks of travertine are everywhere covered with reeds, lichens, confervae, and various kinds of aquatic vegetables, and, at the same time that the process of vegetable life is going on, the crystallisations of the calcareous matter, which is everywhere deposited in consequence of the escape of carbonic acid, likewise proceed, giving a constant <b>milkiness</b> to what, from its tint, would otherwise be a blue fluid. So rapid is the vegetation, owing to the decomposition of the carbonic acid, that, even in winter, masses of confervae and lichens, mixed with deposited travertine, are constantly detached by the currents of water from the bank and float down the stream, which being a considerable river is never without many of these small islands on its surface; they are sometimes only a few inches in size, and composed merely of dark-green confervae or purple or yellow lichens, but they are sometimes even of some feet in diameter, and contain seeds and various species of common water-plants, which are usually more or less encrusted with marble. There is, I believe, no place in the world where there is a more striking example of the opposition or contrast of the laws of animate and inanimate Nature, of the forces of inorganic chemical affinity and those of the powers of life. Vegetables in such a temperature, and everywhere surrounded by food, are produced with a wonderful rapidity, but the crystallisations are formed with equal quickness, and they are no sooner produced than they are destroyed together. Notwithstanding the sulphureous exhalations from the lake, the quantity of vegetable matter generated there and its heat make it the resort of an infinite variety of insect tribes, and even in the coldest days in winter numbers of flies may be observed on the vegetables surrounding its banks or on its floating island's, and a quantity of their larvae may be seen there sometimes encrusted and entirely destroyed by calcareous matter, which is likewise often the fate of the insects themselves, as well as of various species of shell-fish that are found amongst the vegetables, which grow and are destroyed in the travertine on its banks. Snipes, ducks, and various water-birds, often visit those lakes, probably attracted by the temperature and the quantity of food in which they abound; but they usually confine themselves to the banks, as the carbonic acid disengaged from the surface would be fatal to them if they ventured to swim upon it when tranquil. In May, 18--, I fixed a stick on a mass of travertine covered by the water, and I examined it in the beginning of the April following for the purpose of determining the nature of the depositions. The water was lower at this time, yet I had some difficulty, by means of a sharp-pointed hammer, in breaking the mass which adhered to the bottom of the stick; it was several inches in thickness. The upper part was a mixture of light tufa and the leaves of confervae; below this was a darker and more solid travertine, containing black and decomposed masses of confervae; in the inferior part the travertine was more solid and of a grey colour, but with cavities which I have no doubt were produced by the decomposition of vegetable matter. I have passed many hours, I may say many days, in studying the phenomena of this wonderful lake; it has brought many trains of thought into my mind connected with the early changes of our globe, and I have sometimes reasoned from the forms of plants and animals preserved in marble in this warm source to the grander depositions in the secondary rocks, where the zoophytes or coral insects have worked upon a grand scale, and where palms, and vegetables now unknown are preserved with the remains of crocodiles, turtles, and gigantic extinct animals of the sauri genus, and which appear to have belonged to a period when the whole globe possessed a much higher temperature. I have, likewise, often been led, from the remarkable phenomena surrounding me in that spot, to compare the works of man with those of Nature. The baths, erected there nearly twenty centuries ago, present only heaps of ruins, and even the bricks of which they were built, though hardened by fire, are crumbled into dust, whilst the masses of travertine around it, though formed by a variable source from the most perishable materials, have hardened by time, and the most perfect remains of the greatest ruins in the eternal city, such as the triumphal arches and the Colosaeum, owe their duration to this source. Then, from all we know, this lake, except in some change in its dimensions, continues nearly in the same state in which it was described 1,700 years ago by Pliny, and I have no doubt contains the same kinds of floating islands, the same plants, and the same insects. During the fifteen years that I have known it it has appeared precisely identical in these respects, and yet it has the character of an accidental phenomenon depending upon subterraneous fire. How marvellous then are those laws by which even the humblest types of organic existence are preserved though born amidst the sources of their destruction, and by which a species of immortality is given to generations floating, as it were, like evanescent bubbles, on a stream raised from the deepest caverns of the earth, and instantly losing what may be called its spirit in the atmosphere." [...] These last observations of the stranger recalled to my recollection some phenomena which I had observed many years ago, and of which I could then give no satisfactory explanation. I was shooting in the marshes which surround the ruins of Gabia, and where there are still remains supposed to be of the Alexandrine aqueduct; I observed a small insulated hill, apparently entirely composed of travertine, and from its summit there were formations of tufa which had evidently been produced by running water, but the whole mass was now perfectly dry and encrusted by vegetables. At first I suspected that this little mountain had been formed by a jet of calcareous water, a kind of small fountain analogous to the Geiser, which had deposited travertine and continued to rise through the basin flowing from a higher level; but the irregular form of the eminence did not correspond to this idea, and I remained perplexed with the fact and unable to satisfy myself as to its cause. The views of the stranger appeared to me now to make it probable that the calcareous water had issued from ancient leaks in the aqueduct and formed a hillock that had encased the bricks of the erection, which in other parts, where not encrusted by travertine, had become entirely decayed, degraded, and removed from the soil. I mentioned the circumstance and my suspicion of its nature. The stranger said: [...] "You are perfectly correct in your idea. I know the spot well, and if you had not mentioned it I should probably have quoted it as an instance in which the works of art are preserved, as it were, by the accidents of Nature. I was so struck by this appearance last year that I had the travertine partially removed by some workmen, and I found beneath it the canal of the aqueduct in a perfect state, and the bricks of the arches as uninjured as if freshly laid." [...] The stranger had hardly concluded this sentence when he was interrupted by Onuphrio, who said, [...] "I have always supposed that in every geological system water is considered as the cause of the destruction or degradation of the surface, but in all the instances that you have mentioned it appears rather as a conservative power, not destroying but rather producing." [...] "It is the general vice of philosophical systems," [...] replied the stranger, [...] "that they are usually founded upon a few facts, which they well explain, and are extended by the human fancy to all the phenomena of Nature, to many of which they must be contradictory. The human intellectual powers are so feeble that they can with difficulty embrace a single series of phenomena, and they consequently must fail when extended to the whole of Nature. Water by its common operation, as poured down from the atmosphere in rain and torrents, tends to level and degrade the surface, and carries the material of the land into the bosom of the ocean. Fire, on the contrary, in volcanic eruptions usually raises mountains, exalts the surface, and creates islands even in the midst of the sea. But these laws are not invariable, as the instances to which we have just referred prove, and parts of the surface of the globe are sometimes destroyed even by fire, of which examples may be seen in the Phlegraean fields, and islands raised by one volcanic eruption have been immerged in the sea by another. There are, in fact, no accidents in Nature; what we call accidents are the results of general laws in particular operation, but we cannot deduce these laws from the particular operation or the general order from the partial result." [...] Ambrosio said to the stranger: [...] "You appear, sir, to have paid so much attention to physical phenomena that few things would give us more pleasure than to know your opinion respecting the early changes and physical history of the globe, for I perceive you do not belong to the modern geological schools." [...] The stranger said, [...] "I have certainly formed opinions or rather speculations on these subjects, but I fear they are hardly worth communicating; they have sometimes amused me in hours of idleness, but I doubt if they will amuse others." [...] I said, [...] "The observations which you have already been so kind as to communicate to us, on the formation of the travertine, lead us not only to expect amusement but likewise instruction." ...|$|E

When the butter is coming, which is easily ascertained by the sound, take off the lid, and with a small, flat board scrape down the sides of the churn, and do the same to the lid: this prevents waste. When the butter is come the butter-milk is to be poured off and spring water put into the churn, and turned for two or three minutes; this is to be then poured away and fresh added, and again the handle turned for a minute or two. Should there be the least <b>milkiness</b> when this is poured from the churn, more must be put in.The butter is then to be placed on a board or marble slab and salted to taste; then with a cream cloth, wrung out in spring water, press all the moisture from it. When dry and firm make it up into rolls with flat boards. The whole process should be completed in three-quarters of an hour. In hot weather pains must be taken to keep the cream from reaching too high a heat. If the dairy be not cool enough, keep the cream-pot in the coldest water you can get; make the butter early in the morning, and place cold water in the churn for a while before it is used.|$|E
40|$|Translucence is an {{important}} property of natural materials, and human observers are adept at perceiving changes in translucence. Perceptions of different material properties appear to arise from different cortical regions, and it is therefore plausible that the perception of translucence is dependent on specialised regions, separate from those important for colour and texture processing. To test for anatomical independence between areas necessary for colour, texture and translucence perception we assessed translucency perception in a cortically colour blind observer, who performs at chance on tasks of colour and texture discrimination. Firstly, {{in order to establish}} that MS has shown no significant recovery, we assessed his colour perception performance on the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue Test. Secondly, we tested him with two translucence ranking tasks. In one task, stimuli were images of glasses of tea varying in tea strength. In the other, stimuli were glasses of tea varying only in <b>milkiness.</b> MS was able to systematically rank both strength and <b>milkiness,</b> although less consistently than controls, and for tea strength his rankings were in the opposite order. An additional group of controls tested with greyscale versions of the images succeeded at the tasks, albeit slightly less consistently on the <b>milkiness</b> task, showing that the performance of normal observers cannot be transformed into the performance of MS simply by removing colour information from the stimuli. The systematic performance of MS suggests that some aspects of translucence perception do not depend on regions critical for colour and texture processing...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} was to analyse growth {{abilities}} of hybrids (?Nb x ?Kal) in comparison with original parental population. Further were evaluated reproductive properties of parental breeds of rabbits New Zealand White and Californian and their combination (?Nb x ?Kal). Enter data were gathered in total from 27 litters. Obtained data were summarized and statistically treated in MS Excel programme and STATISTICA version 9. To assess the development of live weight, the rabbits were weighed at 7 -day intervals from birth {{until the end of}} fattening, it is to the age of 126 days. For the analysis of reproductive abilities was in single females litters observed the number of all born offspring, from that the number of live-born and still-born offspring and the number of weaned offspring. Further, the length of gravidity, the length of season and age at weaning, <b>milkiness</b> and total mortality were observed. The assessment of growth and reproductive abilities was made in dependence on sequence of litter and on the observed calendar year. The results showed higher increases in 60 th, 90 th and 120 th days of age hybrid offspring than a breeds pattern book by paternal population requires. The achievement of high weight gains confirms the suitability of using these hybrids for intensive production of quality dietetic rabbit meat. It was also achieved excellent results in <b>milkiness</b> females in the observed breeding. Its average value was 3965 g, which is comparable with <b>milkiness</b> of broiler breeds in large breedings. Total results confirmed the suitability of using Californian rabbit breeds in a maternal position and the New Zealand White in a paternal position to create commercial hybrids intended for fattening. Their hybrid offspring reach better growth ability than original parental population. Results of this study can be specific recommendation especially for small breeders of meat-type rabbits when choosing a suitable combination of breeds for fattening...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was {{performance}} comparison of selected populations of two breeds of rabbits, the Moravian blue (Mm) and the Dutch rabbit (Ho), large and small breed of rabbit in fact. The monitored aspects were the production characters (growth and carcass yield) and reproduction characters (average numbers of birth, number of all births, live born and still-born births and number of weaning rabbits, ability of pregnancy, <b>milkiness).</b> Population {{of each of the}} breeds was monitored in a selected base of 68 litters of Moravian blue and 84 litters of Dutch rabbit. Both monitored breeds are recognized by the Czech Breeders Association as bred breeding and club breeding rabbits. Growth was monitored in regular intervals from birth until the end of fattening, i. e. until 8 months of age at Moravian blue a until 6 months of age at Dutch rabbit. The results were compared with the gain in weight published in pattern book of breeds. To evaluate <b>milkiness,</b> each of litters was weighed at 2 and 21 days of age. To compare the reproduction characters the monitored criteria were number of births, total natality and mortality and the number of raised births. The gained values of both breeds were compared and evaluated depending on increment of living mass and the fattening period. Carcass yield was monitored according to the traditional procedure of selected animals of average live weight and after reaching the slaughter age. The results show significantly higher gain in weight throughout the growth period of Dutch rabbit, than required by the pattern book of breeds. Moravian blue showed lower average increase of weight during the first five months of age from standard. The average number of rabbits in litter was 6, 3 births at Moravian blue and  6, 48 births at Dutch rabbit. On the other hand breeding succest and overall natality gave better results at Moravian blue. It has also been found that the <b>milkiness</b> of Moravian blue was 3985, 4 grams in comparison with 2582, 2 grams at Dutch rabbit, which is given by the size of breed. The slaughter analysis showed the carcass yield to be 56, 1 % at Moravian blue and 62, 4 % at Dutch rabbit, which is a value approaching meat breeds but at a lower meat production. The overall summary of the gained results showed greater production of living matter at Moravian blue rabbit providing greater demands for animal housing and feeding base. Its brood provides greater potential for growth and in some aspects better reproduction character. On the other hand, Dutch rabbit reached paradoxically more births in litter and higher carcass yield of undoubtedly better quality meat. Results of this thesis can be beneficial for choosing breed for novice breeders and for existing breeders it can help in their attempts to improve the strengths and eliminate the weaknesses of their breed...|$|E
40|$|Clarity of high lipid sera {{is closely}} {{correlated}} with elevated proportions of serum phospholipids, and lipemia (<b>milkiness)</b> with low proportions of phospholipids. Clear high lipid sera occur uniquely in obstructive jaundice, both intra- and extrahepatic in origin.

Even in grossly lipemic sera, {{a significant proportion of}} the serum lipids is masked in particles of invisible size. Enzymatic removal of the stabilizing properties of serum "lecithin" unmasks this hitherto invisible fraction. The concentration of serum phospholipids available for complex formation with serum proteins appears to be an important factor in determining particle size of serum lipids and hence of their occurrence in serum as masked or as visible particles.

Work goal: the {{analysis}} of change of an index of reproductive characteristics of a sow depending on age. For achievement of this goal, raise the following objektives: 1) to estimate change of reproductive characteristics of investigated sows from the first to the last farrows; 2) to calculate indexes (R) reproductive characteristics for each sow, separately on everyone farrow; 3) to estimate index change (R) reproductive characteristics at number increase farrow. The work has been executed in 2008 in the enterprise of pigs of the Kaunas area. It was made 14 groups of sows of breed landrace. Test sows were from first to seventh farrows. The analysis of a reproduction and calculations of an index of a reproduction are executed on everyone farrow (from 1 to 7). For an estimation of efficiency and a reproduction index were analyzed the following indicators: 1. Fertility of sows, in units; 2. Quantity of piglets 21 days old, in units; 3. Weight of nest of piglets 21 days old, in kilo; 4. Quantity of piglets at weaning, in units; 5. Weight of nest of piglets at weaning, in kilo. The analysis of the sow's fertility changes, depending on the quantity of farrows, found that the fertility increased from the first farrow. The lowest fertility was at first pigs sow – 9. 93 piglets, the highest fertility was found during the fourth farrow – 10. 63 units or 0. 70 piglets more that the first farrow. From the fourth farrow was found the tendency of reduction of fertility, i. e. fertility of the fifth farrow was 0. 06 units, sixth – 0. 13 units and seventh – 0. 30 inits lower than the fourth farrow. Quantity of piglets 21 days old and at weaning, the fourth farrows were also the largest - accordingly on 9. 25 piglets. These indicators {{had a tendency to}} increase from the first farrow, and from the fourth - to decrease. Worst results were during at the seventh farrows time, i. e. quantity of piglets 21 days old and at weaning was on 7. 33 piglets, or 1. 92 piglets less that the fourth farrow. The analysis of the sow's <b>milkiness</b> (weight of nest of piglets 21 days old) changes, depending on farrows, found that more <b>milkiness</b> was a first pig sows – 54. 71 kilo. By the third farrow, sow <b>milkiness</b> was similar level, while the fourth farrows found a marked reduction tendency. The lowest <b>milkiness</b> was the seventh farrow sows – 39. 33 kilo, or 14. 21 kilo (p< 0, 05) less that the third farrow and 15. 38 kilo (p< 0, 05) less that the first. The largest weight of weaning nest was found of the third farrow sows – 82. 00 kilo, or 4. 14 kilo more that the first pig sow. From the third farrow the weight of weaning nest also had a tendency to reduction. The lowest weight of weaning nest was found of the seventh farrow sows – 66. 33 kilo or 15. 67 kilo less that the third farrow. On the basis of the average data of each farrow, it was calculated the index (R) of reproductive characteristics. From the first to the fourth farrow (except the second) the reproduction index increased. The index of reproduction of the fourth farrow was the highest 36. 99, or 1. 36 units more that the first farrow. From the fourth farrow the reproduction index decreased. By the seventh farrow, it was lowest – 31. 17, or 5. 82 units less that the fourth farrow and 4. 46 units less that the first farrow. On the basis on the received results it is possible to do following conclusions: 1. Fertility of sows of the fourth farrow, quantity of piglets 21 days old and at weaning was the highest: accordingly 0. 70; 0. 39 and 0. 46 piglets more that the first farrow. 2. The largest weight of weaning nest was found of the third farrow sows – 82. 00 kilo, or 4. 14 kilo more that the first pig sow. 3. Value of an index of reproductive in regular intervals reflected changes of indicators of each farrow: more the best signs of value having farrows have been estimated by the best index of a reproduction – 36. 99 of the fourth farrow sows. 4. The index of reproductive, as the main of reproductive characteristics rates, increased until the fourth farrow, and then began to steady decreased. Also it is possible to present such offers: 1. Based on the regularity of change of indications of reproductive characteristics, in a prominent decrease in the level of the fifth farrow, advisable in the pig enterprises, in the reproductive sector sows kept up to the fifth farrow. 2.

From this small beginning, pisciculture has become an industry of national importance. McCay of Cornell University and Davis of the United States Bureau of Fisheries have clarified many problems pertaining to fish culture and nutrition. The food of wild trout varies with the locality, the season, {{and the age of}} the fish, but it consists mainly of the larvae of various insects such as the dragonfly or caddis fly and crayfish (l). Species’ differences play a part in food selection; for example, 15 % of the stomach contents of rainbow trout consists of algae (2), while green vegetation is eaten in negligible amounts by other species of trout. Perhaps this fact may account for the difficulty which is sometimes experienced in raising rainbow trout in captivity. The food available for hatchery feeding may be divided into three classes: (a) fresh meat, such as liver, heart, et cetra; (b) dried animal products such as meat or fish meal, and dried skim-milk; (c) vegetable products such as wheat middlings and cottonseed meal. Liver {{was one of the first}} substances to be used and has continued to be one of the most successful of artificial trout foods. However, there are certain disadvantages in using liver as a trout food.

40|$|Abstract: The goal of {{investigation}} in the domestic Balkan goat was to establish the effect of body weight and lactation number on milk yield and fertility. Research was done in herds belonging to private farmers, during a one-year period, on a total of 578 goats. Investigated herds were monitored also by lactation number,i. e. kidding number (lactations 1, 2 and 3 individually, lactation 4 and following lactations investigated together). Body weight and milk yield were measured, while fertility was determined {{as the number of}} live born kids per 100 goats. Goats were also sorted into groups by age and body weight, while the interval within groups and between groups was 5 kg. Average total milk yield in the investigated population of the domestic Balkan goat was 177. 5 kg. A statististically significant difference (P< 0, 01) was established for milk yield depending on body weight and age, except for goats in lactation 1 (P< 0, 05). In lactation 3 and 4, goats with body weights over 45 kg, comprising 30. 23 % of the total number in these groups, had the highest milk yields (over 200 kg). Pertaining to lactation number, i. e. kidding number, as well as body weight in both years {{of investigation}}, lowest fertility was found in lactations 1 and 2 (112 %), and in goats with lowest body weight (25 - 30 kg), while this considerably increased lactation 4 and later lactations (136 %), and body weights of over 40 kg (140 %).

Both studies investigated the purchasing and consumption behaviors, attitudes, opinions and expectations of Taiwanese people toward cheese. The focus group results provided good predictions and explanations of survey findings. Consuming fast foods introduced cheese to Asians. However, cheese {{may not be the}} main reason to consume fast foods. Cheese was considered as an ingredient in foods. Consuming cheese at a restaurant was more frequent than at home. Cheese sandwiches, fast foods, au gratin foods, cheesecake and spaghetti were popularly consumed at restaurants. Home consumption frequency of cheese was less than once a month. Subjects whose parents and elders do not accept cheese, were not knowledgeable about cheese. Chinese culture influenced subjects' attitudes and behaviors relating to cheese. First, cheese was consumed in a hot and melted form. Then, small packages of cheese were purchased for home use. Finally, subjects were willing to try new Chinese foods specially developed for cheese. Sensory, visual and marketing factors influenced decision-making of cheese purchasing. Strong product characteristics affecting cheese purchasing were price (moderate), health concerns (low in fat and cholesterol and high in calcium) and form (sliced cheese individually wrapped with plastic film). The important sensory expectations of cheese were the presence of stringiness (appearance and texture), creaminess (aroma), softness, fineness, melted in hands, and smoothness (texture), and <b>milkiness</b> and buttery (flavor) and the absence of oiliness (appearance and flavor), stickiness (appearance) and bitter and sour aftertaste (flavor).

40|$|Suffolk breed is the English hornless breed which {{belongs to}} the breed of meat yield. Typical {{features}} are excellent maternal qualities, good <b>milkiness</b> of ewes and fertility, less fertile period (lambing mostly in winter and spring) and good adaptability to different climatic conditions and breeding conditions. The breed {{is characterized by a}} black outer coat {{on the face of the}} head and lower part of legs, wool is short, white, semi-fine. Suffolk breed is characterized by high fertility throughout the production period ewes. Season, age, interval among lambing, body weight and body conditions score, nutrition, genetics, breeding and heat stress belong to the factors affecting fertility. When we compare fertility sheep breed Suffolk in the Czech Republic and Slovakia we achieved a higher number of ewes, improved fertility and fertilization. On the contrary, Slovakia has achieved better results in fertility at lambing ewe. It was also achieved in Canada in comparison with our republic. It is a major prerequisite of the production of heavy great muscled slaughter lambs with very good quality meat at meat production. Meat production is influenced by hormones, nutrition, gender, influence year and month of lambing, ewes age, litter size on the dependent variable. The values are not very different when meat production in Suffolk breed is evaluated in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. In spite of it, the Czech Republic achieves better results in weight of lambs at 100 days and the average daily gain. If we evaluate the difference between meat production in Canada and the Czech Republic in selected parameters such as birth weight of lambs, weight of lambs at 100 days of age and avarage daily gain, Canada clearly has much better results. The main cause is a different type of breed. Increase fertility and meat production can be achieved mainly by improving reproduction and production indicators...|$|E

Furthermore, the age structure was evaluated in basic herd of sows. The farmers had the most sows in the first and second litter, compared to that of the fifth litter sows had a few breeders. The requirement for longevity therefore not been complied with. The results of performance tests were evaluated reproductive performance of sows of basic herd in collections (the number of all born piglets, the number of live born piglets, the number of surviving piglets and <b>milkiness).</b> The average value of a breeding population did not meet the target. Some companies, however, had excellent results, especially ZD Mladotice and Zemet Ltd. Tečovice. In field tests were evaluated gain, the percentage of lean meat and backfat thickness.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} diploma thesis was {{to perform}} an {{analysis}} of sheep breeding of Suffolk breed in basic reproductive performance and meat production traits aspects. The information for rating these aspects was used from two farms. The first of them used conventional way of breeding (ZVOZD Horácko, družstvo) and the second one used ecological way (EkofarmaKosařůvmlýn, s. r. o.). Fertilization, fertility, intensity and rearing belong among monitored reproductive indicators. These reproductive indicators are expressed in percentages. Regarding meat production traits rating in this thesis we compared influences of year of lambing, farming method, birth month, sex, litter size and age of dam. All these influences were judge according to birth weight (kg), weight {{at the age of}} 100 days (kg), average growth (g), depth of the longest dorsal muscle (mm) and according to depth of subcutaneous fat (mm). Reproductive performance and meat production were monitored in years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015. In terms of reproductive performance with a few exceptions it was true that ZVOZD Horácko, družstvo reached the best values, and in most cases better than the national average. For example in terms of intensity values in 2012 ZVOZD Horácko, družstvo had 35, 9 % better results compared to national average. In the same year this farm reached 48, 1 % higher values of percentage rearing compared to national average. Ekofarma Kosařův mlýn, s. r. o. showed worse performances, however it was in most cases better than national average. In terms of intensity in 2011 Ekofarma Kosařův mlýn, s. r. o. had the same results as the ZVOZD Horácko, družstvo. Meat production properties were supported by statistical calculations and all of them were conclusive at least at the level of significance P < 0, 05 in all cases except month of birth effect on birth weight. The best results of meat production in terms of effect of lambing had the year 2012, when the birth weight was one of the highest and the other properties (weight at the age of 100 days, average growth, depth of the longest dorsal muscle, depth of subcutaneous fat) were by far the highest in the period of 2011 - 2015. Next we found out that the ecological way of breeding (in this case Ekofarma Kosařůvmlýn, s. r. o.) has better results than the conventional way (ZVOZD Horácko, družstvo). The effect of birthmonth has the significant influence on the indicators of meat production and the lambs born in April had the best results. In the case of sex rams are better. Litter size has very important influence on meat production the more lambs per one mother, the lower birth weights, the lower weights until the period of weaning, the lower weights at the age of 100 days. It is affected by <b>milkiness</b> of the mother. Moreover, the age of mothers also play a significant role. In our research the highest birth weights had lambs of one year old mothers and all other indicators were the highest in the case of three year old dams...|$|E
40|$|The aim was {{to create}} a {{literary}} recherche about breeding of meat breeds and add to it a small rating sample of selected indicators of meat production in the selected Charolais herd. The values were determined based on regular weighting coming out of a yield control (birth weight, weight at 120 and 210 days of age). The results were processed into charts and tables disaggregated by sex to be clear. The theoretical part is dedicated to the analysis of a breeding of Charolais meat herd. It focuses on the description of housing in summer and winter, nutrition of cows throughout a year, mating and calving of cows, general organization in a herd. The monitored herd of Charolais meat breed belongs to the agricultural company, which is located in Telč near Jihlava. The main business is crop and livestock production. Crop production is mainly focused on cereals, oilseed rape and maize silage. In livestock production dominates breeding of a Holstein breed and milk production. Meat herd is located in the village Rozsíčka, which lies near Telč. At the time of observation were in the herd in total 37 pieces, including 29 cows and 8 heifers. In a calving season 37 calves were born alive and a weighing was done on a total of 35 pieces in all age categories. From this number were 17 heifers and 18 bullocks. Based on detected data individual weights were compared and leveled within the herd by sex and then compared with averages of an evaluated yield control over the country. The average birth weight for heifers was 37 kg, which coincides with the national average of 37. 4 kg and the average birth weight for bullocks is exactly equal to the average in the country, namely 40 kg. The average weight recorded by heifers at 120 days of age was 176 kg and 186 kg by bulls. Both values are above average compared to the whole republic. At 210 days of age heifers with the average weight of 267 kg and bulls with 282 kg are below average of the republic. Daily gain from birth to 210 days of age was by heifers 1. 1 kg and 1. 16 kg by bulls. Furthermore, number of births were avaluated in each month. Heifers were born mostly in April from the whole period, a total of 10 pieces. By bulls a number of births is distributed evenly among all months compared to heifers. Overall, it can be determined that the greatest frequency of calving falls on the first third of summer feast, especially on April. From the results is meat yield of the herd rated as above average. The main influence on the achieved values has a culling which is consistently performed for fertility, easiness of births, <b>milkiness</b> of mothers. Further, from a smaller herd point of view it is assured enough of quality food throughout a year. From a reproduction point of view a very long period of time falls on a calving and that impairs an organization of a breeding...|$|E
