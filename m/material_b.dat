50|$|The inset of {{the figure}} shows the circuit {{schematic}} symbol of the HBV. From the symbol, one can conclude that the HBV consists of two, back to back, anti-serially connected rectifying diodes (such as Schottky diodes for instance). The gap {{in the middle of}} the diode symbol represents the inherent capacitance of the device. The electrical characteristics of the HBV are realized by separating two layers of a semiconductor material (A) with a layer of another semiconductor <b>material</b> (<b>B).</b> The band-gap of <b>material</b> (<b>B)</b> should be larger than for material (A). This results in a barrier for the carriers trying to travel through the layers (A)-(B)-(A). The (A) layers are usually n-doped which means that electrons are the majority carriers of this device. At different bias voltages the carriers are redistributed and the distance between the carriers on each side of the barrier (B) is different. As a consequence the HBV has electrical properties resembling the parallel plate capacitor with a voltage dependent plate distance d.|$|E

50|$|A crucial {{factor in}} {{determining}} the thermal resistance at an interface is the overlap of phonon states. Given two materials, A and B, if material A has a low population (or no population) of phonons with certain k value, there will be very few phonons of that wavevector to propagate from A to B. Further, due to the detailed balance, very few phonons of that wavevector will propagate the opposite direction, from B to A, even if <b>material</b> <b>B</b> has a large population of phonons with that wavevector. Thus as the overlap between phonon dispersions is small, there are less modes to allow for heat transfer in the material, giving at a high thermal interfacial resistance relative to materials {{with a high degree}} of overlap.Both AMM and DMM reflect this principle, but differ in the conditions they require for propagation across the interface. Neither model is universally effective for predicting the thermal interface resistance (with the exception of very low temperature), but rather for most materials they act as upper and lower limits for real behavior.|$|E

40|$|Thermal {{interface}} materials (TIMs) {{are widely}} used in the electronics industry to facilitate heat conduction away from the working components. As the development in this industry is heading towards higher performances along with smaller components, heat density increases exponentially. This has imposed a demand for better TIMs. The aim of this master thesis is to characterise two commercial thermal interface materials, Material A and <b>Material</b> <b>B,</b> and investigate their time dependent properties. To predict the thermal performance of the two materials during their service life, knowledge of their time-dependent properties is vital. Material A and <b>Material</b> <b>B</b> serve as heat flow enhancers in Ericsson´s base stations {{all over the world}} and this master thesis is performed in collaboration with Ericsson AB, Göteborg. Characterisation of the two materials was performed at Chalmers University of Technology and Swerea IVF, using a number of analysing methods. It was found that both materials have an organo-siloxane matrix which is bimodally filled with highly thermally conductive particles. In order to investigate the long-term properties of the two materials, comparisons between test results from un-aged and aged specimen of both materials was made. It may be concluded that the shear and peel strength of Material A improved during ageing and its hardness increased. These results are believed to be associated with an increase in the amount of cross-links in the material introduced during the ageing process. Material A is superior to <b>Material</b> <b>B</b> for all test conditions in the shear and peel experiments and, in contrast to Material A, <b>Material</b> <b>B</b> weakened during ageing. The inferiority of <b>Material</b> <b>B</b> is thought to be due to embrittlement and dry-out during ageing. Results from the creep tests performed revealed that the aged samples of Material A is more creep resistant and showed a more solid-like behaviour. The thermal conductivity tests showed that Material A has better thermal performance and the performance is maintained after the ageing process. <b>Material</b> <b>B</b> showed an all over poorer performance and suffers from deteriorated thermal performance upon ageing. This is believed to be associated with an increased bond line thickness (BLT) and contact resistances of <b>Material</b> <b>B.</b> The thermal performance of both materials was recognised to be pressure dependent. However, above a certain threshold value of the pressure, the performance of Material A was shown to be independent of the pressure...|$|E

The primary component of a wet clutch is the paper-based friction disc and steel separator disc immersed in transmission uid. Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) develop and build automatic powershift-transmissions with wet clutches for use in their heavy-duty equipment. Volvo CE and Luleå University of Technology (LTU) conduct research on wet clutches which involves paper-based friction materials. The two most common materials in production, material A and B, were tested in a wet clutch test rig at LTU. The tests showed a wear phenomenon in material A where the wear rate at a inection point signicantly increases. This work examines {{what might have happened}} with the material and if <b>material</b> <b>B</b> shows the same phenomenon. After the test run with <b>material</b> <b>B</b> it appeared to have a hint of the same phenomenon, but only after about 5 000 more cycles then for material A. Analysis of optical and scanning electron microscope, elemental analysis, oil absorption test, analysis of temperature and friction coecient history and comparisons of the materials dierent compositions were carried out. It turned out that material A is more permeable than <b>material</b> <b>B,</b> which is virtually impenetrable. <b>Material</b> <b>B</b> was subjected to {{more than twice as many}} cycles as material A before the same degree of mass loss occurred.

No differences could be detected between the ESCA spectra of the explants, and those of the control specimens. which were from the same synthetic batch and which were stored in dry form during the entire experimental period. <b>Material</b> <b>B</b> was also stable upon irradiation with X-rays in vitro. even at high doses, compared to the clinical situation, Exposure of <b>material</b> <b>B</b> to gamma -radiation. however. was found to lead to structural degradation. This was evident from clear yellowing, and also from the ESCA spectra. The spectra revealed that <b>material</b> <b>B</b> deteriorates during gamma -irradiation through rupture of C-C and/or C-O chemical bonds, not via C-I bond disruption. It can be concluded that iodine is tightly bound to these radiopaque biomaterials. This is important with regard to potential applications of these materials as implant biomaterials.
