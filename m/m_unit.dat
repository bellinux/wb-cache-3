The nonbaryonic roots of the SQCD vacua lead to new cascades because, for example, the 3 -cycle swept does not link all of the D 5 ’s. This decay is the S-dual of a MMS instanton, which is the decay into flux of a brane that is trivial in twisted K-theory.

Several Cuneiform inscriptions have been found in Goa and an Oracle plate dedicated to Inana has been recovered from Savoi Verem. Sumerians are believed to have modified many local customs and introduce their own systems such as their style of temple architecture, the Devadasi system; the Sumerians also influenced the language, caste system, and the kinship practices to some extent. Sumerian influence in Goa can also be seen in the entertainment and games of the region.|$|E

Fluorescence decay traces reveal characteristic decay times of 1. 1 ns and 210 ps for M and the dimer, respectively. Transient absorption spectra in the spectral range of 425 - 1050 nm display similar spectral features for both systems, but strongly differ in the characteristic relaxation times gathered from a global fit of the experimental data. To rationalize the data we propose that after excitation of the dimer the energy localizes on one M branch and then decays to a dark state, peculiar only of the dimer. This dark state relaxes to the ground state within 210 ps through non-radiative relaxation. The nature of the dark state is discussed in relation to different possible photophysical processes such as excimer formation and charge transfer between the two <b>M</b> <b>units.</b> Anisotropy decay traces of the probe-beam differential transmittance of M and the dimer fall on complete different time scales as well. The anisotropy decay for M is satisfactorily ascribed to rotational diffusion in DMSO, whereas for the dimer it occurs on a faster time scale and is likely caused by energy-transfer processes between the two monomer <b>M</b> <b>units...</b>|$|R
50|$|Baba Jan III. On the Central Mound {{only the}} {{superimposed}} foundations from two phases of a Manor (30 x 35 m) survive. The earlier, level 2, {{consisted of a}} rectangular court with a north-south axis flanked by long narrow rooms, the whole with towers both at the corners and midpoints of all sides. When rebuilt in level 1, the Manor consisted of a central columned hall (one row of three columns) surrounded by long narrow rooms. On the East Mound the almost 2,000 m2 excavation yielded the Fort and Painted Chamber. The excavated portion of the Fort, whose walls survived to a height of 3-4 m, consisted of a large (12 m2) room with four irregularly placed columns and surrounded by long rectangular chambers. A spiral ramp led either to a second story or the roof. Further rooms extended to the south. The Painted Chamber (10 x 12 <b>m)</b> <b>unit</b> was added at {{the east end of}} the Fort. This ceremonial hall, which opened southward onto an enclosed courtyard, had two columns, a niche and doorway with reveals, white walls decorated with red paint, and a painted-tile ceiling. The Fort and Painted Chamber were probably the seat of a local ruler. The extent and nature of the settlement are uncertain. Fire destroyed this complex {{at the end of the}} eighth century B.C. The pottery evidence suggests that the East Mound buildings were built and used after the Central Mound Manors.

Methods: in a cross-sectional observational study, 373 of the 23, 360 genetic sonograms performed at a private maternal-fetal medicine clinic over 5 years showed intracardiac echogenic foci (ICEF). These 373 sonograms were reviewed for chromosomal and cardiac anomalies and associations were analyzed using the chi(2) test or the Fisher exact test. P < 0. 05 was considered significant. Results: the prevalence of ICEF was 1. 7 %. Cardiac anomalies were detected in 10 sonograms (2. 7 %) and chromosomal anomalies in 14 (3. 7 %). There were cardiac defects in 6 (1. 7 %) of the 359 euploid fetuses with isolated ICEF of the 373 women who had fetuses with ICEF, 295 were younger than 35 years and 78 were 35 years or older. There were 6 fetuses (2. 1 %) with aneuploidy in the younger group and 8 (10. 3 %) in the older group. Conclusion: the prevalence of ICEF was 1. 7 %, {{and there was an}} association between cardiac and chromosomal anomalies.
