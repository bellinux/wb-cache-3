5|$|<b>Maybe</b> <b>This</b> Christmas Too? is {{a holiday}} {{compilation}} album released in October 2003 through Nettwerk Records featuring contemporary musicians performing both classic and original Christmas songs. The compilation {{served as a}} sequel to <b>Maybe</b> <b>This</b> Christmas (2002) and preceded <b>Maybe</b> <b>This</b> Christmas Tree (2004). A portion of the proceeds from the album went to Toys for Tots, a charity supported by the United States Marine Corps.

5|$|Reluctant to give Rupert back to Stewie, Stanford Cordray (the buyer, {{voiced by}} Rob Lowe) {{and his family}} {{organize}} a skiing race down the mountain, so if Stewie is the first down, {{they are allowed to}} take Rupert away with them and if Stanford wins, he can have Brian. Stewie cheats by installing rockets in his skis, and relaxes to watch his progress. Stewie then crashes into a tree and loses the race. He tells Brian that <b>maybe</b> <b>this</b> means he should give up Rupert, but he proceeds to grab Rupert after telling his personal butler Crohn to throw a cup of hot tea on the child's face, forcing him to drop the bear. The two make a run for it before the child's parents notice, then realize they still {{need to get back to}} Quahog (which, by looking at a highway sign at the end, is 2112 miles away, a reference to the Rush 1976 album), so they carjack a passing driver in the city and drive home.|$|E

5|$|Sculpturing is seen {{on many of}} {{the skull}} bones, in the form of long grooves, pits and protrusions. Like other ceratosaurs, the frontal bones of the skull roof were fused together. Carnotaurines {{commonly}} had bony projections from the skull. Carnotaurus had two pronounced horns, projecting outward above the eyes, while its close relative Aucasaurus had smaller projections in the same area. Majungasaurus and Rajasaurus had a single bony horn or dome, projecting upwards from the skull. These projections, like the horns of many modern animals, might have been displayed for species recognition or intimidation. In Arcovenator, the dorsal margin of the postorbital (and probably also the lacrimal) is thickened dorsolaterally, forming a strong and rugose bony brow ridge rising above the level of the skull roof. <b>Maybe</b> <b>this</b> rugose brow ridge supported a keratinous or scaly structure for displays.|$|E

25|$|Students {{fighting}} those USAF Migs {{were supposed}} to learn {{enough to be able}} to kill a Mig, or at least to survive, in their first real dogfight with a Mig. <b>Maybe</b> <b>this</b> training also contributed to improve Israeli tactics as in the 1980s they achieved good kill ratios against Syrian MiG-23s.|$|E
25|$|Adolescent {{girls and}} boys who are {{attracted}} to others {{of the same sex}} are strongly affected by their surroundings in that adolescents often decide to express their sexualities or keep them secret depending on certain factors in their societies. These factors affect {{girls and boys}} differently. If girls’ schools and religions are against same sex attractions, they pose the greatest obstacles to girls who experience same sex attractions. These factors were not listed as affecting boys as much. The researchers suggest that <b>maybe</b> <b>this</b> is because not only are some religions against same-sex attraction, but they also encourage traditional roles for women and do not believe that women can carry out these roles as lesbians. Schools may affect girls more than boys because strong emphasis is placed on girls to date boys, and many school activities place high importance on heterosexuality (such as cheerleading). Additionally, the idea of not conforming to typical male gender roles inhibited many boys from openly expressing their same-sex attraction. The worry of conforming to gender roles didn’t inhibit girls from expressing their same-gender preferences as much, because society is generally more flexible about their gender expression.|$|E
500|$|<b>Maybe</b> <b>This</b> Christmas is {{the first}} in a series of three {{consecutive}} holiday compilation albums released through Nettwerk. <b>Maybe</b> <b>This</b> Christmas Too? and <b>Maybe</b> <b>This</b> Christmas Tree were released in October 2003 and October 2004, respectively. The series was named by Ron Sexsmith, who contributed the title track to the compilation. A portion of the proceeds from the sales of each album went to Toys for Tots, a charity supported by the United States Marine Corps. <b>Maybe</b> <b>This</b> Christmas contains thirteen [...] "rock-oriented" [...] tracks recorded by various artists. Most of the tracks exclusive to the album were recorded just a few months prior to its release. Allmusic's MacKenzie Wilson dubbed the compilation an [...] "album suited for those twenty-somethings searching for [...] not-so-typical Christmas collection." [...] The cover art was designed by artist Paul Frank, creator of Julius the [...] "illustrated, wide-mouth monkey".|$|E

500|$|<b>Maybe</b> <b>This</b> Christmas Too? is {{a sequel}} to the 2002 {{compilation}} album <b>Maybe</b> <b>This</b> Christmas, which reached a peak position of number thirty-eight on Billboard Top Holiday Albums chart. <b>Maybe</b> <b>This</b> Christmas Tree, released in 2004, was the third installment of the series. A portion of the proceeds from the sales of the three albums went to Toys for Tots, a charity supported by the United States Marine Corps. <b>Maybe</b> <b>This</b> Christmas Too? features fourteen tracks recorded by various artists, {{most of whom were}} associated with the Nettwerk record label during its release. Ten of the tracks were recorded specifically for this compilation album. Darin Harmon served as the album's executive producer and Ianthe Zevos served as the project manager. Mastering of the compilation was donated by Louie Teran. In August 2003, MTV reported on the possible inclusions of The Used's [...] "Alone This Holiday", The Flaming Lips' [...] "Winter Wonderland" [...] and The Polyphonic Spree's [...] "Winter Wonderslumber", none of which ended up on the final release.|$|E
500|$|<b>Maybe</b> <b>This</b> Christmas is {{a holiday}} {{compilation}} album released in November 2002 through Nettwerk Records featuring contemporary musicians performing both classic and original Christmas songs.

500|$|Allmusic's MacKenzie Wilson {{wrote that}} <b>Maybe</b> <b>This</b> Christmas Too? {{would appeal to}} [...] "both casual and die-hard music fans of all ages". Wilson called Wainwright's {{performance}} [...] "classic chamber pop with a warm spirit" [...] and also noted the [...] "fetching" [...] graphic design work for the album's cover art by Brian [...] "Goatpillow" [...] Brooks of Cosmic Debris. Andrew Gilstrap's review for PopMatters also complimented [...] "Spotlight on Christmas", calling the song a [...] "clever piece of class-conscious commentary" [...] that provides a [...] "perfect example of [...] meticulous toyshop brand of pop." [...] Simmy Richman of The Independent considered The Flaming Lips' rendition of [...] "White Christmas" [...] to be the [...] "strangest" [...] he had ever heard. Gilstrap used the same adjective ("strange") to describe [...] "O Holy Night", and thought [...] "Silent Night" [...] was [...] "incredibly potent" [...] despite its short length. The New York Times Kelefa Sanneh called [...] "White Christmas" [...] "spooky" [...] and wrote that the album [...] "brings to the world something more ambivalent than joy". Gilbert concluded that <b>Maybe</b> <b>This</b> Christmas Too? [...] "feels just about right" [...] and [...] "does a fine job of representing the less than stellar aspects of a wintry, commercialized holiday like Christmas." [...] In 2008 The A.V. Club included [...] "Spotlight on Christmas" [...] as number thirty-nine on its list of [...] "42 holiday entertainments that don't make us want to claw our eyes out with rage".|$|E
500|$|A remixed and remastered version, {{featuring}} four bonus tracks, {{was released}} in 2004 through Capitol Records {{as part of the}} group's reissued back catalogue. According to the liner notes of the remastered version of Cryptic Writings, Dave Mustaine had to alter many lyrics at the request of their new manager, Bud Prager. The liner notes suggest that Mustaine was not a fan of the changes, but other interviews indicate the band actively sought and eventually accepted Prager's advice for the album. [...] "I figured <b>maybe</b> <b>this</b> guy (Prager) could help me get that intangible number one record I wanted so badly", Mustaine wrote in the liner notes.|$|E

500|$|Nielsen's half-uncle Jean Hersholt was {{an actor}} {{known for his}} {{portrayal}} of Dr. Christian in a radio series of that name, and the subsequent television series and films. In a 1994 Boston Globe article, Nielsen explained, [...] "I did learn very early that when I would mention my uncle, people {{would look at me}} as if I were the biggest liar in the world. Then I would take them home and show them 8-by-10 glossies, and things changed quite drastically. So I began to think that <b>maybe</b> <b>this</b> acting business was not a bad idea, much as I was very shy about it and certainly without courage regarding it. My uncle died not too long after I {{was in a position to}} know him. I regret that I had not a chance to know him better." ...|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the album}} is {{presented}} in-character {{through the eyes of}} various fictional characters and onlookers. [...] "Fortune 500" [...] documents a fictional attempt to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II, which Higgs relates to the thoughts of suicide bombers moments before they detonate: [...] "The horror of the doubt is far worse than the act, for the terrorist I mean. It’s this 'oh shit... <b>maybe</b> <b>this</b> isn’t what God wants'. I think it’s the darkest moment on the record." [...] Spearman called the inclusion of loaded, political lyrics on otherwise upbeat songs [...] "the Trojan Horse approach ... get your interesting lyrical idea into something that {{on the face of it}} is just there to be enjoyed". Higgs told NME that Kanye West's 2013 album Yeezus had a major impact on his writing, encouraging him to present himself more confidently, while Nick Cave provided inspiration to be more impulsive with his writing.|$|E
500|$|After the {{extensive}} world tour {{in support of}} Youthanasia, Megadeth took time off late in 1995. Mustaine began work on MD.45, a side project with vocalist Lee Ving of Fear. The duo hired drummer Jimmy DeGrasso, who had played with Alice Cooper on the South American Monsters of Rock tour earlier that year. Marty Friedman built a studio in his new home in Phoenix and completed his fourth solo album, released in April 1996. In September 1996, Megadeth went to London to work on songs for the next album. The songwriting was closely supervised by new manager Bud Prager, who contributed musical ideas and lyrics; many lyrics and song titles were changed at his request. Regarding Prager's influence, Mustaine later wrote: [...] "I figured <b>maybe</b> <b>this</b> guy [...] could help me get that intangible number one record I so badly wanted." [...] The album, recorded in Nashville, was Megadeth's first collaboration with country pop producer Dann Huff, who had met Mustaine in 1990.|$|E
