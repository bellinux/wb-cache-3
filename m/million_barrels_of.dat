5|$|Though Newark {{is not the}} {{industrial}} colossus of the past, the city does have {{a considerable amount of}} industry and light manufacturing. The southern portion of the Ironbound, also known as the Industrial Meadowlands, has seen many factories built since World War II, including a large Anheuser-Busch brewery that opened in 1951 and distributed 7.5 <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> beer in 2007. The service industry is also growing rapidly, replacing those in the manufacturing industry, which was once Newark's primary economy. In addition, transportation has become a large business in Newark, accounting for more than 17,000 jobs in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Smallpox afflicted {{the islands}} in the 17th and 18th centuries, but as {{vaccines}} became common after 1760 the population increased {{to a maximum of}} 31,670 in 1861. However, British rule came at price for many ordinary people as well as traders. The Shetlanders' nautical skills were sought by the Royal Navy. Some 3,000 served during the Napoleonic wars from 1800 to 1815 and press gangs were rife. During this period 120 men were taken from Fetlar alone, and only 20 of them returned home. By the late 19th century 90% of all Shetland was owned by just 32 people, and between 1861 and 1881 more than 8,000 Shetlanders emigrated. With the passing of the Crofters' Act in 1886 the Liberal prime minister William Gladstone emancipated crofters from the rule of the landlords. The Act enabled those who had effectively been landowners' serfs to become owner-occupiers of their own small farms. By this time fishermen from Holland, who had traditionally gathered each year off the coast of Shetland to fish for herring, triggered an industry in the islands that boomed from around 1880 until the 1920s when stocks of the fish began to dwindle. The production peaked in 1905 at more than a <b>million</b> <b>barrels,</b> <b>of</b> which 708,000 were exported.|$|E

40|$|Smackover Field, {{discovered}} in 1922, {{is an excellent}} example of the methodology of heavy oil handling and loss in early 20 th century flush production fields. Emulsion problems and waste were severe; <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> heavy oil were stored in earthen pits for up to a decade, and <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> oil were lost to land and water. The largest quantity of crude oil waste was from the inadequate handling and treatment of water-in-oil emulsions. Crude oil loss was also associated with earthen storage both on leases and in large tank farms. Lease storage pits served numerous purposes and had the most complex fluid his-tory. Many were used for decades as saltwater disposal pits fol-lowing the flush oil period. Large earthen tank farms on the field edge stored <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> heavy oil in the 1920 s and 1930 s but were not used for saltwater storage. Today the farms exist within young forests where the ground is hardened by as-phaltic deposits associated with both earthen construction and seepage loss. Drainage areas also provide a record of the exten-sive waste oil history. Asphaltic layers are most prominent in creek areas that did not burn, but degraded oil exists to some ex-tent in almost all field drainage areas...|$|R

25|$|When Busch {{implemented}} pasteurization (1878) {{as a way}} to {{keep the}} beer fresh for longer, his company was able to profit from shipping beer across the country. Busch soon acquired breweries in Texas which allowed his operation to distribute to Mexico and California. Busch was an early adopter of bottled beer and founded the Busch Glass Company to make bottles for his product. In 1901 sales surpassed the one <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> beer benchmark.|$|E

50|$|Kuwait’s oil {{industry}} poses a large {{threat to the}} already valuable and poisonous water sources. Kuwait still stores <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> oil in oil wells that have leakages causing chemicals to seep into the Earth.

In December 1978, a ZANLA unit penetrated the outskirts of Salisbury and fired a volley of rockets and incendiary device rounds into the main oil storage depot – the most heavily defended economic asset in the country. The storage tanks burned for five days, giving off a column of smoke {{that could be seen}} 80 miles away. Half a <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> petroleum product (comprising Rhodesia's strategic oil reserve) were lost. At a stroke, the country's annual budget deficit was increased by 20%.|$|E

While Indiana has made commitments to increasing use of renewable resources such as wind, hydroelectric, biomass, or solar power, however, progress has been very slow, {{mainly because of the}} continued abundance of coal in Southern Indiana. Most of the new plants in the state have been coal gasification plants. Another source is hydroelectric power.|$|E
