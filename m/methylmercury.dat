5|$|Although {{the concern}} for a thiomersal-autism link was {{originally}} derived from indirect evidence based on the known potent neurotoxic effects of <b>methylmercury,</b> recent studies show these feared effects were likely overestimated. Ethylmercury, such as in thiomersal, clears much faster from the body after administration than <b>methylmercury,</b> suggesting total mercury exposure over time is much less with ethylmercury. Currently used methods of estimating brain deposition of mercury likely overestimates the amounts deposited due to ethylmercury, and ethylmercury also decomposes quicker in the brain than <b>methylmercury,</b> suggesting a lower risk of brain damage. These findings show that the assumptions that originally led to concern about the toxicity of ethylmercury, which were based on direct comparison to <b>methylmercury,</b> were flawed.|$|E
5|$|Human {{pollution}} {{has affected}} {{the behavior of the}} American white ibis via an increase in the concentrations of <b>methylmercury,</b> which is released into the environment from untreated waste. Exposure to <b>methylmercury</b> alters the hormone levels of American white ibis, affecting their mating and nesting behavior and leading to lower reproduction rates.|$|E
5|$|Fish and {{shellfish}} {{have a natural}} tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies, often {{in the form of}} <b>methylmercury,</b> a highly toxic organic compound of mercury. Species of fish that are high on the food chain, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, bluefin tuna, albacore tuna, and tilefish contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. As mercury and <b>methylmercury</b> are fat soluble, they primarily accumulate in the viscera, although they are also found throughout the muscle tissue. When this fish is consumed by a predator, the mercury level is accumulated. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating <b>methylmercury,</b> fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on the food chain amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called biomagnification. Mercury poisoning happened this way in Minamata, Japan, now called Minamata disease.|$|E
5|$|Mercury {{poisoning}} {{can result}} from exposure to water-soluble forms of mercury (such as mercuric chloride or <b>methylmercury),</b> by inhalation of mercury vapor, or by ingesting any form of mercury.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} human health {{concerns}} {{associated with the}} consumption of dolphin meat in Japan after tests showed that dolphin meat contained high levels of <b>methylmercury.</b> There are no known cases of mercury poisoning {{as a result of}} consuming dolphin meat, though the government continues to monitor people in areas where dolphin meat consumption is high. The Japanese government recommends that children and pregnant women avoid eating dolphin meat on a regular basis. Similar concerns exist with the consumption of dolphin meat in the Faroe Islands, where prenatal exposure to <b>methylmercury</b> and PCBs primarily from the consumption of pilot whale meat has resulted in neuropsychological deficits amongst children.|$|E
5|$|Increased dietary {{selenium}} {{reduces the}} effects of mercury toxicity, although it is effective only at low to modest doses of mercury. Evidence suggests that the molecular mechanisms of mercury toxicity includes the irreversible inhibition of selenoenzymes that are required to prevent and reverse oxidative damage in brain and endocrine tissues. An antioxidant, selenoneine, which is derived from selenium and {{has been found to}} be present in the blood of bluefin tuna, is the subject of scientific research regarding its possible roles in inflammatory and chronic diseases, <b>methylmercury</b> detoxification, and oxidative damages.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time mercury was found in local fish at such high levels that {{consumption}} warnings were posted for fishermen. A Florida panther was found dead with levels of mercury high enough to kill a human. Scientists found that power plants and incinerators using fossil fuels were expelling mercury into the atmosphere, and it fell as rain or dust during droughts. The naturally occurring bacteria that reduce sulfur in the Everglades ecosystem were transforming the mercury into <b>methylmercury,</b> and it was bioaccumulating through the food chain. Stricter emissions standards helped lower mercury coming from power plants and incinerators, which in turn lowered mercury levels found in animals, though {{they continue to be}} a concern.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, Taiji's bid {{to expand}} their school lunch {{programs}} to include dolphin and whale meat brought about much controversy. An estimated 150kg (330lbs) of dolphin meat was served in Taiji school lunches in 2006. In 2009, dolphin meat was taken off school menus because of the contamination. The levels of mercury and <b>methylmercury</b> taken from samples of dolphin and whale meat sold at supermarkets {{most likely to be}} providing the schools' lunch programs was 10 times that advised by the Japanese Health Ministry. The mercury levels were so high that the Okuwa Co. supermarket chain in Japan permanently removed dolphin meat from its shelves.|$|E
5|$|Organic mercury {{compounds}} are historically important but are of little industrial {{value in the}} western world. Mercury(II) salts are a rare example of simple metal complexes that react directly with aromatic rings. Organo{{mercury compounds}} are always divalent and usually two-coordinate and linear geometry. Unlike organocadmium and organozinc compounds, organomercury compounds do not react with water. They usually have the formula HgR2, which are often volatile, or HgRX, which are often solids, where R is aryl or alkyl and X is usually halide or acetate. <b>Methylmercury,</b> a generic term for compounds with the formula CH3HgX, is a dangerous family of compounds that are often found in polluted water. They arise by {{a process known as}} biomethylation.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises {{and other}} smaller cetaceans, mainly dolphins, are hunted in an {{activity}} known as drive hunting. This is accomplished by driving a pod together with boats and usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the ocean with other boats or nets. Porpoises are hunted this way in several places around the world, including the Solomon Islands, the Faroe Islands, Peru, and Japan, the most well-known practitioner of this method. By numbers, porpoises are mostly hunted for their meat, though some end up in dolphinariums. Despite the controversial nature of the hunt resulting in international criticism, and the possible health risk that the high <b>methylmercury</b> levels impose, thousands of porpoises are caught in drive hunts each year.|$|E
5|$|A {{review of}} the data showed that while the vaccine {{schedule}} for infants did not exceed FDA, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), or WHO guidelines on mercury exposure, it could have exceeded Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards {{for the first six}} months of life, depending on the vaccine formulation and the weight of the infant. The review also highlighted difficulty interpreting toxicity of the ethylmercury in thiomersal because guidelines for mercury toxicity were based primarily on studies of <b>methylmercury,</b> a different mercury compound with different toxicologic properties. Multiple meetings were scheduled among various government officials and scientists from multiple agencies to discuss the appropriate response to this evidence. There was a wide range of opinions on the urgency and significance of the safety of thiomersal, with some toxicologists suggesting there was no clear evidence that thiomersal was harmful and other participants like Neal Halsey, director of the Institute of Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, strongly advocating removal of thiomersal from vaccines due to possible safety risks. In the process of forming the response to this information, the participants attempted to strike a balance between acknowledging possible harm from thiomersal and the risks involved if childhood vaccinations were delayed or stopped.|$|E
25|$|<b>Methylmercury</b> {{exposure}} during rodent gestation, {{a developmental}} period that approximately models human neural development {{during the first}} two trimesters of gestation, has long-lasting behavioral consequences that appear in adulthood and, in some cases, may not appear until aging. Prefrontal cortex or dopamine neurotransmission could be especially sensitive to even subtle gestational <b>methylmercury</b> exposure and suggests that public health assessments of <b>methylmercury</b> based on intellectual performance may underestimate the impact of <b>methylmercury</b> in public health.|$|E
25|$|Because <b>methylmercury</b> {{is formed}} in aquatic systems {{and because it}} is not readily {{eliminated}} from organisms it is biomagnified in aquatic food chains from bacteria, to plankton, through macroinvertebrates, to herbivorous fish and to piscivorous (fish-eating) fish. At each step in the food chain, the concentration of <b>methylmercury</b> in the organism increases. The concentration of <b>methylmercury</b> in the top level aquatic predators can reach a level a million times higher than the level in the water. This is because <b>methylmercury</b> has a half-life of about 72 days in aquatic organisms resulting in its bioaccumulation within these food chains. Organisms, including humans, fish-eating birds, and fish-eating mammals such as otters and whales that consume fish {{from the top of the}} aquatic food chain receive the <b>methylmercury</b> that has accumulated through this process. Fish and other aquatic species are the only significant source of human <b>methylmercury</b> exposure.|$|E
25|$|Experimental {{findings}} have demonstrated {{an interaction between}} selenium and <b>methylmercury,</b> but epidemiological studies have found little evidence that selenium helps {{to protect against the}} adverse effects of <b>methylmercury.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mercury {{poisoning}} {{is a type}} {{of metal}} poisoning due to mercury exposure. Symptoms depend upon the type, dose, method, and duration of exposure. They may include muscle weakness, poor coordination, numbness in the hands and feet, skin rashes, anxiety, memory problems, trouble speaking, trouble hearing, or trouble seeing. High level exposure to <b>methylmercury</b> is known as Minamata disease. <b>Methylmercury</b> exposure in children may result in acrodynia (pink's disease) in which the skin becomes pink and peels. Long-term complications may include kidney problems and decreased intelligence. The effects of long-term low-dose exposure to <b>methylmercury</b> is unclear.|$|E
25|$|Ingested <b>methylmercury</b> {{is readily}} and {{completely}} {{absorbed by the}} gastrointestinal tract. It is mostly found complexed with free cysteine and with proteins and peptides containing that amino acid. The methylmercuric-cysteinyl complex is recognized by amino acid transporting proteins in the body as methionine, another essential amino acid. Because of this mimicry, it is transported freely throughout the body including across the blood–brain barrier and across the placenta, where it is absorbed by the developing fetus. Also for this reason {{as well as its}} strong binding to proteins, <b>methylmercury</b> is not readily eliminated. <b>Methylmercury</b> has a half-life in human blood of about 50 days.|$|E
25|$|Many {{governmental}} agencies, {{the most}} notable ones being the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Health Canada, and the European Union Health and Consumer Protection Directorate-General, {{as well as the}} World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), have issued guidance for fish consumers that is designed to limit <b>methylmercury</b> exposure from fish consumption. At present, most of this guidance is based on protection of the developing fetus; future guidance, however, may also address cardiovascular risk. In general, fish consumption advice attempts to convey the message that fish is a good source of nutrition and has significant health benefits, but that consumers, in particular pregnant women, women of child-bearing age, nursing mothers, and young children, should avoid fish with high levels of <b>methylmercury,</b> limit their intake of fish with moderate levels of <b>methylmercury,</b> and consume fish with low levels of <b>methylmercury</b> no more than twice a week.|$|E
25|$|Flooding of soils {{associated}} with reservoir creation (e.g. for hydroelectric power generation) {{has been linked}} to increased <b>methylmercury</b> concentrations in reservoir water and fish.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{concerns}} exist {{with the}} consumption of dolphin meat in the Faroe Islands, where prenatal exposure to <b>methylmercury</b> and PCBs primarily from {{the consumption of}} pilot whale meat has resulted in neuropsychological deficits amongst children.|$|E
25|$|Organic mercurial compounds, such as <b>methylmercury,</b> {{have a high}} {{affinity}} for sulfhydryl groups, which causes dysfunction of the enzyme choline acetyltransferase. This inhibition may lead to acetylcholine deficiency, and can have consequences on motor function.|$|E
25|$|The term Hunter-Russell {{syndrome}} {{derives from}} a study of mercury poisoning among workers in a seed packing factory in Norwich, England in the late 1930s who breathed <b>methylmercury</b> that was {{being used as a}} seed disinfectant and preservative.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} several episodes in which {{large numbers of people}} were {{severely}} poisoned by food contaminated with high levels of <b>methylmercury,</b> notably the dumping of industrial waste that resulted in the pollution and subsequent mass poisoning in Minamata and Niigata, Japan and the situation in Iraq in the 1960s and 1970s in which wheat treated with <b>methylmercury</b> as a preservative and intended as seed grain was fed to animals and directly consumed by people (see Basra poison grain disaster). These episodes resulted in neurological symptoms including paresthesias, loss of physical coordination, difficulty in speech, narrowing of the visual field, hearing impairment, blindness, and death. Children who had been exposed in-utero through their mothers' ingestion were also affected with a range of symptoms including motor difficulties, sensory problems and intellectual disability.|$|E
25|$|Mercury {{and many}} of its {{chemical}} compounds, especially organomercury compounds, can also be readily absorbed through direct contact with bare, or in some cases (such as <b>methylmercury)</b> insufficiently protected, skin. Mercury and its compounds are commonly used in chemical laboratories, hospitals, dental clinics, and facilities involved in the production of items such as fluorescent light bulbs, batteries, and explosives.|$|E
25|$|Fish and {{shellfish}} {{have a natural}} tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies, often {{in the form of}} <b>methylmercury,</b> a highly toxic organic compound of mercury. Species of fish that are high on the food chain, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, albacore tuna, and tilefish contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. This is because mercury is stored in the muscle tissues of fish, and when a predatory fish eats another fish, it assumes the entire body burden of mercury in the consumed fish. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating <b>methylmercury,</b> fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on the food chain amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called biomagnification. The first occurrence of widespread mercury poisoning in humans occurred this way in Minamata, Japan, now called Minamata disease.|$|E
25|$|According to the WHO, {{all humans}} {{are exposed to}} some level of mercury. Factors that {{determine}} whether health effects occur and their severity include the type of mercury concerned (<b>methylmercury</b> and ethylmercury, commonly found in fish, being more serious than elemental mercury); the dose; the age or developmental stage of the person exposed (the foetus is most susceptible); the duration of exposure; and the route of exposure (inhalation, ingestion or dermal contact). The universal standard for examining mercury toxicity is usually {{discussed in terms of}} the amount of mercury in the bloodstream for short-term exposure or the amount of mercury excreted in the urine relative to creatine for long-term mercury exposure. Elemental mercury (which is a component of amalgam) is absorbed very differently than <b>methylmercury</b> (which is found in fish). The exposure to mercury from amalgam restorations depends on the number and size of restorations, composition, chewing habits, food texture, grinding, brushing of teeth, and many other physiological factors.|$|E
25|$|Chelation {{therapy for}} acute {{inorganic}} mercury poisoning {{can be done}} with DMSA, 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS), D-penicillamine (DPCN), or dimercaprol (BAL). Only DMSA is FDA-approved for use in children for treating mercury poisoning. However, several studies found no clear clinical benefit from DMSA treatment for poisoning due to mercury vapor. No chelator for <b>methylmercury</b> or ethylmercury is approved by the FDA; DMSA is the most frequently used for severe <b>methylmercury</b> poisoning, as it is given orally, has fewer side-effects, and {{has been found to be}} superior to BAL, DPCN, and DMPS. α-Lipoic acid (ALA) has been shown to be protective against acute mercury poisoning in several mammalian species when it is given soon after exposure; correct dosage is required, as inappropriate dosages increase toxicity. Although it has been hypothesized that frequent low dosages of ALA may have potential as a mercury chelator, studies in rats have been contradictory. Glutathione and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) are recommended by some physicians, but have been shown to increase mercury concentrations in the kidneys and the brain.|$|E
25|$|Denaturing {{conditions}} {{are necessary for}} proper estimation of molecular weight of RNA. RNA is able to form more intramolecular interactions than DNA which may result in change of its electrophoretic mobility. Urea, DMSO and glyoxal are the most often used denaturing agents to disrupt RNA structure. Originally, highly toxic <b>methylmercury</b> hydroxide was often used in denaturing RNA electrophoresis, {{but it may be}} method of choice for some samples.|$|E
25|$|Outbreaks of <b>methylmercury</b> {{poisoning}} {{occurred in}} several places in Japan during the 1950s due to industrial discharges of mercury into rivers and coastal waters. The best-known instances were in Minamata and Niigata. In Minamata alone, more than 600 people died due to {{what became known as}} Minamata disease. More than 21,000 people filed claims with the Japanese government, of which almost 3000 became certified as having the disease. In 22 documented cases, pregnant women who consumed contaminated fish showed mild or no symptoms but gave birth to infants with severe developmental disabilities.|$|E
25|$|Mercury {{is capable}} of {{inducing}} CNS damage by migrating into the brain by crossing the BBB. Mercury exists {{in a number of}} different compounds, though <b>methylmercury</b> (MeHg), dimethylmercury and diethylmercury are the only significantly neurotoxic forms. Diethylmercury and dimethylmercury are considered some of the most potent neurotoxins ever discovered. MeHg is usually acquired through consumption of seafood, as it tends to concentrate in organisms high on the food chain. It is known that the mercuric ion inhibits amino acid (AA) and glutamate (Glu) transport, potentially leading to excitotoxic effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{period between}} {{exposure}} to <b>methylmercury</b> {{and the appearance}} of symptoms in adult poisoning cases is long. The longest recorded latent period is five months after a single exposure, in the Dartmouth case (see History); other latent periods in the range of weeks to months have also been reported. No explanation for this long latent period is known. When the first symptom appears, typically paresthesia (a tingling or numbness in the skin), it is followed rapidly by more severe effects, sometimes ending in coma and death. The toxic damage appears to be determined by the peak value of mercury, not the length of the exposure.|$|E
25|$|Due to its low food {{self-sufficiency}} rate, around 40%, Japan relies on stockpiling {{to secure a}} stable food supply. As of 2009, Japan's 1.2 million ton seafood stockpile included nearly 5000 tons of whale meat. Japan has started to serve whale meat in school lunches {{as part of a}} government initiative to reduce the amounts. However, there has been criticism of serving whale meat to school children due to allegations of toxic <b>methylmercury</b> levels. The World Wildlife Fund has also estimated that the Japanese government has had to invest $12 million into the 2008–09 Antarctic whale hunt alone just to break even, and that subsidies in total have amounted to about $150 million since 1988.|$|E
25|$|Throughout 1965 and 1966, {{researchers}} from the Kumamoto University Research Group (that {{had been set up}} to investigate the original outbreak) and Dr. Hajime Hosokawa (the former Chisso hospital director) brought their significant experience from Minamata and applied it to the Niigata outbreak. Many lessons were learned from Minamata and the investigation into the cause of the outbreak proceeded much more smoothly than it had in Minamata. The prefectural government, Niigata University, citizen's organisations, and local people all worked together to uncover the cause. In March 1966, factory plant wastewater was reported to be suspected as the source of pollution, and in September, the Ministry of Health and Welfare announced it had discovered <b>methylmercury</b> in moss at the outlet of the Showa Denko factory in Kanose village.|$|E
25|$|The Chisso Minamata factory {{first started}} {{acetaldehyde}} production in 1932, producing 210tons that year. By 1951, production had jumped to 6,000tons {{per year and}} reached a peak of 45,245 tons in 1960. Throughout, the Chisso factory's output amounted to between a quarter {{and a third of}} Japan's total acetaldehyde production. The chemical reaction used to produce the acetaldehyde used mercury sulfate as a catalyst. Starting August 1951, the co-catalyst was changed from manganese dioxide to ferric sulfide. A side reaction of this catalytic cycle led to the production of a small amount of an organic mercury compound, namely <b>methylmercury.</b> This highly toxic compound was released into Minamata Bay from the change of the co-catalyst in 1951 until 1968, when this production method was discontinued.|$|E
25|$|In plant feed, {{environmental}} factors influence {{the availability of}} crucial nutrients or micronutrients, a lack or excess of which can cause a great many ailments. In Australia, for instance, where the soil contains limited phosphate, cattle are being fed additional phosphate {{to increase the efficiency}} of beef production. Also in Australia, cattle and sheep in certain areas were often found losing their appetite and dying in the midst of rich pasture; this was at length found to be a result of cobalt deficiency in the soil. Plant toxins are also a risk to grazing animals; for instance, sodium fluoroacetate, found in some African and Australian plants, kills by disrupting the cellular metabolism. Certain man-made pollutants such as <b>methylmercury</b> and some pesticide residues present a particular hazard due to their tendency to bioaccumulate in meat, potentially poisoning consumers.|$|E
25|$|Cerebral palsy {{is caused}} by {{abnormal}} development or damage to {{the parts of the}} brain that control movement, balance and posture. Most often the problems occur during pregnancy; however, they may also occur during childbirth, or shortly after birth. Often the cause is unknown. Risk factors include preterm birth, being a twin, certain infections during pregnancy such as toxoplasmosis or rubella, exposure to <b>methylmercury</b> during pregnancy, a difficult delivery, and head trauma during {{the first few years of}} life, among others. About 2% of cases are believed to be due to an inherited genetic cause. A number of sub-types are classified based on the specific problems present. For example, those with stiff muscles have spastic cerebral palsy, those with poor coordination have ataxic cerebral palsy, and those with writhing movements have athetoid cerebral palsy. Diagnosis is based on the child's development over time. Blood tests and medical imaging may be used to rule out other possible causes.|$|E
25|$|However, a {{dramatic}} photographic essay by W. Eugene Smith brought world attention to Minamata disease. His Japanese wife {{and he lived}} in Minamata from 1971 to 1973. The most famous and striking photo of the essay, Tomoko Uemura in Her Bath (1972) shows Ryoko Uemura, holding her severely deformed daughter, Tomoko, in a Japanese bath chamber. Tomoko was poisoned by <b>methylmercury</b> while still in the womb. The photo was very widely published. It was posed by Smith with the co-operation of Ryoko and Tomoko to dramatically illustrate {{the consequences of the}} disease. It has subsequently been withdrawn from circulation at the request of Tomoko's family, so does not appear in recent anthologies of Smith's works. Smith and his wife were extremely dedicated to the cause of the victims of Minamata disease, closely documenting their struggle for recognition and right to compensation. Smith was himself attacked and seriously injured by Chisso employees in an incident in Goi, Ichihara city, near Tokyo on January 7, 1972, in an attempt to stop the photographer from further revealing the issue to the world. The 54-year-old Smith survived the attack, but his sight in one eye deteriorated and his health never fully recovered before his death in 1978.|$|E
