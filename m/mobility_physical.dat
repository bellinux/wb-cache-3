40|$|Background. While {{increasing}} evidence links environments to health behavior, clinicians lack information about patients’ {{physical activity levels}} and lifestyle environments. We present mobile health tools to collect and use spatio-behavioural lifestyle data for personalized physical activity plans in clinical settings. Methods. The Dyn@mo lifestyle intervention was developed at the Sainte-Justine University Hospital Center to promote physical activity and reduce sedentary time among children with cardiometabolic risk factors. <b>Mobility,</b> <b>physical</b> activity, and heart rate were measured in free-living environments during seven days. Algorithms processed data to generate spatio-behavioural indicators that fed a web-based interactive mapping application for personalised counseling. Proof of concept and tools are presented using data collected among the first 37 participants recruited in 2011. Results. Valid accelerometer data was available for 5. 6 (SD= 1. 62) days in average, heart rate data for 6. 5 days, and GPS data was available for 6. 1 (2. 1) days. Spatio-behavioural indicators were shared between patients, parents, and practitioners to support counseling. Conclusion. Use of wearable sensors along with data treatment algorithms and visualisation tools allow to better measure and describe real-life environments, <b>mobility,</b> <b>physical</b> activity, and physiological responses.

40|$|Abstract — Designing robots {{that are}} capable of {{interacting}} with humans in real life settings is a challenging task. One key issue is the integration of multiple modalities (e. g., <b>mobility,</b> <b>physical</b> structure, navigation, vision, audition, dialogue, reasoning) into a coherent framework. Taking the AAAI Mobile Robot Challenge (making a robot attend the National conference on Artificial Intelligence) as the experimental context, we are currently addressing hardware, software and computation integration issues involved in designing a robot capable of sophisticated interaction with humans.

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} the interrater {{agreement and the}} internal {{construct validity of the}} <b>Physical</b> <b>Mobility</b> Scale, a tool routinely used to assess mobility of people living in residential aged care. Design Prospective, multicenter, external validation study. Setting Nine residential aged care facilities in Australia. Participants Residents (N= 186). Phase 1 cohort (99 residents; mean age, 85. 22 ± 5. 1 y); phase 2 cohort (87 residents; mean age, 81. 59 ± 10. 69 y). Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures Kappa statistics, minimal detectable change (MDC 90) scores, and Bland-Altman plots were used to assess interrater agreement. Scale unidimensionality, item hierarchy, and person separation were examined with Rasch analysis for both cohorts. Results Agreement between raters on 6 of the 9 <b>Physical</b> <b>Mobility</b> Scale items was high (κ 3 ̆e. 60). The MDC 90 value was 4. 39 points, and no systematic differences in scores between raters were found. The <b>Physical</b> <b>Mobility</b> Scale showed a unidimensional structure demonstrated by fit to the Rasch model in both cohorts (phase 1 : χ 2 = 23. 90, P=. 16, person separation index= 0. 96; phase 2 : χ 2 = 22. 00, P=. 23, person separation index= 0. 96). Standing balance was the most difficult item in both cohorts (phase 1 : logit= 2. 48, SE, 0. 16; phase 2 : logit= 2. 53, SE, 0. 15). The person-item threshold map indicated no floor or ceiling effects in either cohort. Conclusions The <b>Physical</b> <b>Mobility</b> Scale demonstrated good interrater agreement and internal construct validity with good fit to the Rasch model in both cohorts. The comparative results across the 2 cohorts indicate generality of the findings. The <b>Physical</b> <b>Mobility</b> Scale total raw scores can be converted to Rasch transformed scores, providing an interval measure of <b>mobility.</b> The <b>Physical</b> <b>Mobility</b> Scale may be suited to a range of clinical and research applications in residential aged care...|$|R
40|$|At {{the outset}} of this research, two fields of {{transport}} research were in the ascendant. The first reflected technological change, considering the growth of new information and communications technologies and their impacts for transport systems and travel behaviour.

Design: Prospective cohort study; measurements at baseline and after 1, 2, and 6 years. Setting: University hospital in the Netherlands. Participants: Seventy-six subjects with PPS and 27 without PPS. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measure: The Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) <b>physical</b> <b>mobility</b> category. Results: Subjects with PPS had significantly poorer health status than subjects without PPS. No significant differences in mean NHP <b>physical</b> <b>mobility</b> scores between baseline and 6 years were found; both groups had improved after I year, after which there was a slow decline over the next 5 years. During the first 2 years, strength measurements showed little decline that {{was not related to}} changes in NHP <b>physical</b> <b>mobility</b> score. A <b>physical</b> performance test revealed no mean change in the first 2 years, but the subgroup with a decline above the 75 th percentile eventually deteriorated 10. 5 +/- 16. 3 points on the NHP <b>physical</b> <b>mobility</b> category (P=. 01) at 6 years from baseline. This subgroup had more extensive paresis than the other subjects, although it was not significant (P=. 07). The extent of paresis at baseline was the only prognostic determinant for an increase in NHP <b>physical</b> <b>mobility</b> problems after 6 years. Conclusions: Subjects with and without PPS did not differ with regard to changes in health status in a 6 -year period. The fact that the extent of paresis was a prognostic factor for a decline in physical functioning is in accord with a (slow) decline in muscle mass, as a late effect of polio, that may lead to a decline in physical functioning as the reduced muscle capacity becomes less able {{to meet the demands of}} daily physical activitie...|$|R
