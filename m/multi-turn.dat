50|$|<b>Multi-turn</b> {{injection}} allows {{accumulation of}} many incoming trains of particles, {{for example if}} a large stored current is required. For particles such as protons {{where there is no}} significant beam damping, each injected pulse is placed onto a particular point in the stored beam transverse or longitudinal phase space, taking care not to eject previously-injected trains by using a careful arrangement of beam deflection and coherent oscillations in the stored beam. If there is significant beam damping, for example radiation damping of electrons due to synchrotron radiation, then an injected pulse may be placed on the edge of phase space and then left to damp in transverse phase space into the stored beam before injecting a further pulse. Typical damping times from synchrotron radiation are tens of milliseconds, allowing many pulses per second to be accumulated.|$|E
5000|$|An {{absolute}} encoder maintains position information when power {{is removed from}} the system. The position of the encoder is available immediately on applying power.

An [...] "incremental" [...] encoder accurately records changes in position, but does not power up with a fixed relation between encoder state and physical position. Devices controlled by incremental encoders may have to [...] "go home" [...] to a fixed reference point to initialize the position measurement. A <b>multi-turn</b> absolute rotary encoder includes additional code wheels and gears.

Theoretically, the case of a <b>multi-turn</b> induction coil is explained and treated perfectly rigorously with Riemann surfaces: what is called [...] "flux linkage" [...] in engineering is simply the flux passing through the Riemann surface bounded by the coil's turns, hence no particularly useful distinction between flux and [...] "linkage." ...|$|E
