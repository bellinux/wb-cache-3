5|$|The first Tintin {{postage stamp}} was an eight-franc stamp issued by Belgian Post for the 50th {{anniversary of the}} {{publication}} of Tintin's first adventure on 29 September 1979, featuring Tintin and Snowy looking through a <b>magnifying</b> <b>glass</b> at several stamps.|$|E
5|$|The {{mouse cursor}} helps to provide visual cues for player actions and movement. The cursor {{appears as a}} hand that changes {{depending}} on what the player is hovering the cursor over. For example, to move in a direction, the cursor changes to point in the intended direction. If players can view an item in greater detail, the cursor changes to a hand holding a <b>magnifying</b> <b>glass.</b> By clicking and dragging the cursor, the player performs actions such as pushing, pulling, and tapping items.|$|E
5|$|Then {{suddenly}} he faltered—and the disturbing truth became obvious. He wasn't reading his address at all. He had learned it by heart. To refresh his memory {{he brought the}} paper {{closer and closer to}} his eyes. When it was only an inch or so away he still couldn't read it, and had to fish for a <b>magnifying</b> <b>glass</b> in his pocket to make the typing visible to him. It was an agonizing moment.|$|E

25|$|Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen) {{wrote about}} the effects of pinhole, concave lenses, and <b>magnifying</b> <b>glasses</b> in his Book of Optics. Roger Bacon used parts of <b>glass</b> spheres as <b>magnifying</b> <b>glasses</b> and {{recommended}} them to be used to help people read. Roger Bacon got his inspiration from Alhacen in the 11th century. He discovered that light reflects from objects rather than emanating from them.|$|R

5|$|The {{front cover}} design, a {{photograph}} of the group on a zebra crossing, was based on ideas sketched by McCartney, and taken on 8 August 1969 outside EMI Studios in Abbey Road. At 11:35 that morning, photographer Iain Macmillan was given only ten minutes to take the photo whilst he stood on a step-ladder and a policeman held up traffic behind the camera. Macmillan took six photographs, which McCartney later examined with a <b>magnifying</b> <b>glass</b> before deciding which of the shots would be used upon the album sleeve.|$|E
5|$|While {{on their}} way to buy jawbreakers at the candy store, the Eds are stopped by Sarah who claims to have found her doll under her bed. Double D then confesses that he {{recently}} found his <b>magnifying</b> <b>glass</b> as well, proving that there never actually was a serial toucher. Despite this revelation, the Eds still decide to spend the money, without freeing Jonny. However, while they are enjoying their jawbreakers, Sarah rolls the tire in which Jonny is trapped in down a hill, knocking the three over. The jawbreakers fly out of their mouths and roll down the street, leaving the Eds to chase after them into the sunset.|$|E
5|$|With no keyboard, the Famicom version {{replaces the}} verb-noun parser with a menu list of {{fourteen}} set commands selectable with the gamepad. This {{is similar to}} the command selection menu system introduced in Yuji Horii's murder mystery adventure game , which was released in 1984, in between the PC and Famicom releases of Portopia. One of the commands on the menu allowed the player to use a point-and-click interface, using the D-pad to move a cursor on the screen in order to look for clues and hotspots. The Famicom version of Portopia also features branching menu selections, which includes using the pointer as a <b>magnifying</b> <b>glass</b> to investigate objects, which is needed to find hidden clues, and as a fist or hammer to hit anything or anyone, which could be used to carry out beatings during suspect interrogations. Additional sequences were also added, notably an underground dungeon maze, with a style similar to role-playing video games.|$|E
50|$|Adaptive devices {{can help}} people read. These include <b>magnifying</b> <b>glasses,</b> special eyeglass lenses, {{computer}} screen readers, and TV systems that enlarge reading material.|$|R
50|$|Extrapolation {{arguments}} are informal and unquantified arguments which assert {{that something is}} true beyond the range of values {{for which it is}} known to be true. For example, we believe in the reality of what we see through <b>magnifying</b> <b>glasses</b> because it agrees with what we see with the naked eye but extends beyond it; we believe in what we see through light microscopes because it agrees with what we see through <b>magnifying</b> <b>glasses</b> but extends beyond it; and similarly for electron microscopes.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} microscopes {{were single}} lens <b>magnifying</b> <b>glasses</b> with limited magnification which date {{at least as}} far back as the wide spread use of lenses in eyeglasses in the 13th century.|$|R
5|$|Murder on the Orient Express, as {{with its}} predecessor, {{features}} an inventory system. There are several {{components of the}} inventory, including a fingerprint examination screen, a scrapbook, and a passport screen for managing and viewing the passengers' passports. There are a total of eighty slots for carrying items in the inventory, spread across five separate screens. Items cannot be discarded from the inventory once they have been acquired. The player can access the inventory by clicking on an icon on the game's interface, or can simply right-click. After items are used, a right-click returns them to the inventory, and the exact slot they were originally placed in. Each item is labelled, and the player can inspect each inventory item in more detail by dragging it over a <b>magnifying</b> <b>glass</b> icon, and can also listen for a soft hissing sound which indicates {{that there is something}} relevant for the player to note about a certain item. In a divergence from other games in its genre, Murder on the Orient Express does not allow the player to combine items in the main inventory screen. There is a separate interface for item combinations, and the player must drag items into this screen if they wish to try to combine them.|$|E
5|$|Bewick {{made use}} of his close {{observation}} of nature, his remarkable visual memory, and his sharp eyesight to create accurate and extremely small details in his wood engravings, which proved to be both a strength and a weakness. If properly printed and closely examined, his prints could be seen to convey subtle clues {{to the character of}} his natural subjects, with humour and feeling. This was achieved by carefully varying the depth of the engraved grooves to provide actual greys, not only black and white, as well as the pattern of the marks to provide texture. But this subtlety of engraving created a serious technical difficulty for his printers; they needed to ink his blocks with {{just the right amount of}} ink, mixed so as to be of exactly the right thickness, and to press the block to the paper slowly and carefully, to obtain a result that would satisfy Bewick. Not surprisingly, this made printing slow and expensive. It also created a problem for Bewick's readers; if they lacked his excellent eyesight, they needed a <b>magnifying</b> <b>glass</b> to study his prints, especially the miniature tail-pieces. But the effect was transformative, and wood engraving became the main method of illustrating books for a century. The quality of Bewick's engravings attracted a far wider readership to his books than he had expected: his Fables and Quadrupeds were at the outset intended for children.|$|E

25|$|In {{some cases}} S2 is negative, {{indicating}} that the image is formed {{on the opposite side}} of the lens from where those rays are being considered. Since the diverging light rays emanating from the lens never come into focus, and those rays are not physically present at the point where they appear to form an image, this is called a virtual image. Unlike real images, a virtual image cannot be projected on a screen, but appears to an observer looking through the lens as if it were a real object at the location of that virtual image. Likewise, it appears to a subsequent lens as if it were an object at that location, so that second lens could again focus that light into a real image, S1 then being measured from the virtual image location behind the first lens to the second lens. This is exactly what the eye does when looking through a <b>magnifying</b> <b>glass.</b> The <b>magnifying</b> <b>glass</b> creates a (magnified) virtual image behind the <b>magnifying</b> <b>glass,</b> but those rays are then re-imaged by the lens of the eye to create a real image on the retina.|$|E
