Objectives. To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of levodopa (L-dopa) and carbidopa after repeated doses of the effervescent tablet of melevodopa/carbidopa (V 1512; Sirio) compared with standard-release L-dopa/carbidopa in patients with fluctuating Parkinson’s disease. Few studies assessed the pharmacokinetics of carbidopa to date. Methods. Thiswas a single-centre, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, two-period crossover study. Patients received V 1512 (<b>melevodopa</b> 100 mg/carbidopa 25 mg) or L-dopa 100 mg/carbidopa 25 mg, 7 doses over 24 hours (Cohort 1), 4 doses over 12 hours (Cohort 2), or 2 doses over 12 hours in combination with entacapone 200 mg (Cohort 3). Pharmacokinetic parameters included area under the plasma-concentration time curve (AUC), maximum plasma concentration...|$|E
40|$|In Alzheimer's disease (AD), {{transcranial}} magnetic stimulation (TMS) {{studies have}} shown abnormalities of motor cortical excitability, such as a decreased intra-cortical inhibition (ICI) and changes in resting motor threshold (rMT). We studied the effects of L-dopa on rMT and ICI in a cohort of moderate AD patients after paired-pulse TMS. Results were compared with a control group of healthy subjects. As expected, AD patients showed {{a significant reduction in}} ICI and a lower rMT. L-dopa administration (soluble form, <b>melevodopa</b> 200 mg) promptly reversed the ICI impairment up to normalization. This effect was specific, since it was not mimicked in control subjects. These results indicate a possible role of dopamine in modulating AD cortical excitability, thus suggesting an interaction between dopaminergic ascending pathways and endogenous intracortical transmitters. In addition, considering that L-dopa showed a pharmacological profile similar to the one of cholinomimetics, L-dopa might represent a reliable tool to study new therapeutic perspective and strategies for AD...|$|E

To {{characterize}} the pharmacokinetic profile of levodopa (L-dopa) and carbidopa after repeated {{doses of the}} effervescent tablet of melevodopa/carbidopa (V 1512; Sirio) compared with standard-release L-dopa/carbidopa in patients with fluctuating Parkinson’s disease. Few studies assessed the pharmacokinetics of carbidopa to date. Methods. This was a single-centre, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, two-period crossover study. Patients received V 1512 (<b>melevodopa</b> 100 mg/carbidopa 25 [*]mg) or L-dopa 100 [*]mg/carbidopa 25 [*]mg, 7 doses over 24 hours (Cohort 1), 4 doses over 12 hours (Cohort 2), or 2 doses over 12 hours in combination with entacapone 200 [*]mg (Cohort 3). Pharmacokinetic parameters included area under the plasma-concentration time curve (AUC), maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), and time to Cmax (tmax). Results. Twenty-five patients received at least one dose of study medication. L-dopa absorption tended to be quicker and pharmacokinetic parameters less variable after V 1512 versus L-dopa/carbidopa, both over time and between patients. Accumulation of L-dopa in plasma was less noticeable with V 1512. Carbidopa exposure and interpatient variability was lower when V 1512 or L-dopa/carbidopa was given in combination with entacapone. Both treatments were well tolerated. Conclusions. V 1512 provides a more reliable L-dopa pharmacokinetic profile versus standard-release L-dopa/carbidopa, with less drug accumulation and less variability.
