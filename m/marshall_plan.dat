5|$|Nixon {{objected to}} Douglas's speech, stating {{that he had}} opposed the Korea bill {{because it did not}} include aid to Taiwan, and had {{supported}} it once the aid had been included. As for the Europe charge, according to Nixon biographer Stephen Ambrose, Nixon was so well known as a supporter of the <b>Marshall</b> <b>Plan</b> that Douglas's charge had no credibility. In fact, Nixon had opposed a two-year reauthorization of the <b>Marshall</b> <b>Plan,</b> favoring a one-year reauthorization with a renewal provision, allowing for more congressional oversight.|$|E
5|$|Recovery {{began with}} the mid-1948 {{currency}} reform in Western Germany, and was sped up by the liberalisation of European economic policy that the <b>Marshall</b> <b>Plan</b> (1948–1951) both directly and indirectly caused. The post-1948 West German recovery {{has been called the}} German economic miracle. Italy also experienced an economic boom and the French economy rebounded. By contrast, the United Kingdom {{was in a state of}} economic ruin, and although it received a quarter of the total <b>Marshall</b> <b>Plan</b> assistance, more than any other European country, continued relative economic decline for decades.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the Swiss {{government}} exported credits {{through the}} charitable fund {{known as the}} Schweizerspende and also donated to the <b>Marshall</b> <b>Plan</b> to help Europe's recovery, efforts that ultimately benefited the Swiss economy.|$|E

50|$|In 1919, Col. Robert B. Marshall, Chief Surveyor for the U.S. Geological Survey, {{proposed}} {{a plan for}} the federal government to build a series of diversion dams, and two grand canals along the sides of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys, consequently irrigating California's Central Valley. Though national interest in <b>Marshall's</b> <b>plan</b> was limited, there was an interest in California for pursuing the proposed project.|$|R
5|$|Stalin {{believed}} that economic integration with the West would allow Eastern Bloc countries to escape Soviet control, {{and that the}} US was trying to buy a pro-US re-alignment of Europe. Stalin therefore prevented Eastern Bloc nations from receiving <b>Marshall</b> <b>Plan</b> aid. The Soviet Union's alternative to the <b>Marshall</b> <b>Plan,</b> which was purported to involve Soviet subsidies and trade with central and eastern Europe, {{became known as the}} Molotov Plan (later institutionalized in January 1949 as the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance). Stalin was also fearful of a reconstituted Germany; his vision of a post-war Germany did not include the ability to rearm or pose any kind of threat to the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|As the United States was {{initiating}} the <b>Marshall</b> <b>Plan,</b> Kennan and the Truman administration {{hoped that the}} Soviet Union's rejection of Marshall aid would strain its relations with its Communist allies in Eastern Europe. Kennan initiated a series of efforts to exploit the schism between the Soviets and Josip Broz Tito's Yugoslavia. Kennan proposed conducting covert action in the Balkans to further decrease Moscow's influence.|$|E

50|$|After World War II, the National Guard {{had to be}} {{completely}} reorganized and rebuilt. In December 1946, the process began and Dozier became an advocate for General George C. <b>Marshall’s</b> <b>plan</b> for the post-war National Guard. Marshall believed a bigger, more powerful, well funded National Guard would help deter future aggression by America’s enemies. “I sincerely {{believe that if we}} had given our security its proper attention, the Axis nations would not have started the war,” said Dozier.|$|R

He informs his Vice President Doggé Sakamoto and subordinates that the war has awakened Joe, and they must defeat him in order to secure the future of the clan.|$|R
5|$|Flanders {{referred}} to the <b>Marshall</b> <b>Plan</b> as an important application of moral law to public policy. He said that the plan’s true purpose was to fend off Communism through the economic restoration of Europe—not to provide relief to Europe (something beyond {{the powers of the}} U.S.), nor to enhance gratitude towards the U.S., its prestige or power.|$|E
5|$|Only a small {{fraction}} of reparations were ever paid. In fact, the historian Stephen Schuker demonstrates in American 'Reparations' to Germany, 1919–33, that the capital inflow from American loans substantially exceeded German outpayments so that, on a net basis, Germany received support equal to four times the amount of the post-Second World War <b>Marshall</b> <b>Plan.</b>|$|E
5|$|Between April 1947 and December 1948, when George C. Marshall was Secretary of State, Kennan {{was more}} {{influential}} {{than he was}} at any other period in his career. Marshall valued his strategic sense and had him create and direct what is now named the Policy Planning Staff, the State Department's internal think tank. Kennan became the first Director of Policy Planning. Marshall relied heavily on him to prepare policy recommendations. Kennan {{played a central role}} in the drafting of the <b>Marshall</b> <b>Plan.</b>|$|E
25|$|To {{clarify the}} US's position, a major address by Secretary of State George <b>Marshall</b> was <b>planned.</b> <b>Marshall</b> gave the {{address to the}} graduating class of Harvard University on June 5, 1947. Standing {{on the steps of}} Memorial Church in Harvard Yard, he offered American aid to promote European {{recovery}} and reconstruction. The speech described the dysfunction of the European economy and presented a rationale for US aid.|$|R
40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{problems}} {{of economic growth}} of Austria {{in the period of}} 1945 — 1953. Analysis of the economic growth process is conducted {{in a way that would}} allow to show the special economic role which was played by American economic, aid implemented within the framework of the <b>Marshall's</b> <b>plan</b> for reconstruction of Austrian economy. The author stresses supremacy of political goals, which W. Truman's administration attached to the plan and he points that the basic economic mechanism of infulence exerted by this aid resulted from the fact that with limited possibilities of internal accumulation it represenied an important source of obtaining economic surplus. Earmarking of economic surplus for investment targets became an essentian factor of economic accelerattion achieved over the period of 1948 — 1951. Summing up, It should be stressed that foreign aid within the <b>Marshall's</b> <b>plan</b> and implementation of the four-year period of reconstruction of Austria's economy possible owing to this aid, combined with a successful stabilization policy of 1952 — 1953, provided foundations for „Austrian economic miracle" of the fifties.

5|$|In Congress, Nixon {{supported}} the Taft–Hartley Act of 1947, {{a federal law}} that monitors the activities and power of labor unions, and he served on the Education and Labor Committee. He {{was part of the}} Herter Committee, which went to Europe to report on the need for U.S. foreign aid. Nixon was the youngest member of the committee and the only Westerner. Advocacy by Herter Committee members, including Nixon, led to congressional passage of the <b>Marshall</b> <b>Plan.</b>|$|E
5|$|Propaganda {{was used}} by both sides to rally {{domestic}} support and demonize enemies during the First World War. PR activists entered {{the private sector in}} the 1920s.

Many American companies with PR departments spread the practice to Europe after 1948 when they created European subsidiaries {{as a result of the}} <b>Marshall</b> <b>plan.</b>|$|E
5|$|The twin {{policies}} of the Truman Doctrine and the <b>Marshall</b> <b>Plan</b> led to billions in economic and military aid for Western Europe, Greece, and Turkey. With the US assistance, the Greek military won its civil war. Under the leadership of Alcide De Gasperi the Italian Christian Democrats defeated the powerful Communist-Socialist alliance in the elections of 1948. At {{the same time there}} was increased intelligence and espionage activity, Eastern Bloc defections and diplomatic expulsions.|$|E

25|$|On January 4, 1809 Clay and Marshall nearly came to blows on the Assembly floor, and Clay {{challenged}} Marshall to a duel. It {{was still}} {{used as a}} method of settling disputes of honor. It took place on January 19. Apparently to keep any blood from being spilled in their home state of Kentucky, they had chosen a dueling ground in Indiana, directly across the Ohio River from what was then Shippingport, Kentucky and near the mouth of Silver Creek. While many contemporary duels were called off or fought without the intention of killing one another, both Clay and <b>Marshall</b> <b>planned</b> on killing their opponent.|$|R
50|$|To {{prove that}} he can date more {{attractive}} women, <b>Marshall</b> <b>plans</b> to show Lily how Jenkins flirts with him. At his workplace, Jenkins kisses Marshall on impulse. Marshall runs home and apologizes to Lily, but she dismisses him as lying to make her jealous. Jenkins later apologizes to Marshall, saying she was drunk from a late-night drinking game. She plans to apologize to Lily, which Marshall eagerly urges her to do to prove to Lily that Jenkins really did kiss him. Lily calmly listens to Jenkins' apology, then proceeds to beat her up. Future Ted mentions that Marshall never tried to make Lily jealous again.|$|R
5|$|Tătărescu {{resigned}} {{his office}} on 6 November 1947, {{and was replaced by}} the Communist Ana Pauker.

Bejan — the party was subsequently known as National Liberal Party-Petre N. Bejan). One of his last actions as cabinet member had been to sign the document officially rejecting the <b>Marshall</b> <b>Plan.</b>|$|E
5|$|From 1945 to 1947 Molotov {{took part}} in all four {{conferences}} of foreign ministers of the victorious states in World War II. In general, he was distinguished by an uncooperative attitude towards the Western powers. Molotov, {{at the direction of}} the Soviet government, condemned the <b>Marshall</b> <b>Plan</b> as imperialistic and claimed it was dividing Europe into two camps, one capitalist and the other communist. In response, the Soviet Union, along with the other Eastern Bloc nations, initiated {{what is known as the}} Molotov Plan. The plan created several bilateral relations between the states of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union; and later evolved into the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA).|$|E
5|$|In 1948 the United States {{announced}} the <b>Marshall</b> <b>Plan</b> initiative {{to help rebuild}} postwar Europe and thus gain more political power there. After initially welcoming the idea of Poland's participation in the plan, the Polish government declined the American offer under pressure from Moscow. Also, following the Uprising of 1953 in East Germany, Poland was forced by the Soviet Union {{to give up its}} claims to compensation from Germany, which as a result paid no significant compensation for war damages, either to the Polish state or to Polish citizens. Poland received compensation in the form of land and property left behind by the German population of the annexed western territories.|$|E

5|$|National policy {{relating}} to the Cold War interested Flanders greatly. He {{was concerned about the}} world-wide encroachment of Communism even without force of arms. He felt that President Truman was generally a good president, but was hampered by the Roosevelt legacy of appeasing the Soviets. He also felt that Truman's commitment to bringing the Nationalist and Communist Chinese factions together into an alliance was mistaken. He endorsed the <b>Marshall</b> <b>Plan</b> as a way to avoid Communist influence in Western Europe. However, he was critical of John Foster Dulles, Secretary of State, for mishandling opportunities to create friendly alignment with Egypt and India, countries which instead sided with the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|The {{implementation}} of the immense task of reconstructing the country was accompanied by the struggle {{of the new government}} to acquire centralized authority, further complicated by the mistrust a considerable part of society held for the new regime and by disputes over Poland's postwar borders, which were not firmly established until mid-1945. In 1947 Soviet pressure caused the Polish government to reject the American-sponsored <b>Marshall</b> <b>Plan,</b> and to join the Soviet Union-dominated Comecon in 1949. The Soviet forces present engaged in plunder of the former eastern territories of Germany which were being transferred to Poland, stripping it of valuable industrial equipment, infrastructure and factories and sending them to the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had little}} {{personal}} expertise on foreign matters, Truman listened closely to his top advisors, especially George Marshall and Dean Acheson. He won bipartisan support for both the Truman Doctrine, which formalized a policy of Soviet containment, and the <b>Marshall</b> <b>Plan,</b> which aimed to help rebuild postwar Europe. To get Congress to spend the vast sums necessary to restart the moribund European economy, Truman used an ideological argument, arguing that Communism flourishes in economically deprived areas. As part of the U.S. Cold War strategy, Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947 and reorganized military forces by merging the Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (later the Department of Defense) and creating the U.S. Air Force. The act also created the CIA and the National Security Council. In 1952, Truman secretly consolidated and empowered the cryptologic elements of the United States by creating the National Security Agency (NSA).|$|E

5000|$|Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory began researching nuclear rockets in 1952, {{accelerating}} into Project Rover in 1955 {{when the}} deputy director of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Herbert York, postulated a way to shrink reactor weights considerably. By 1961, after unexpectedly fast-paced progress on the part of Project Rover, NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center began to use nuclear thermal rockets in their mission <b>plans.</b> <b>Marshall</b> <b>planned</b> to use a nuclear-powered rocket from Los Alamos to power a RIFT (Reactor-In-Flight-Test) nuclear stage to be launched as early as 1964, and the need for planning and oversight {{led to the formation of}} the Space Nuclear Propulsion Office. SNPO was formed so that the AEC and NASA could work together, and H. B. [...] "Harry" [...] Finger was selected as its first director. Finger made a decision to delay RIFT, and he defined strict objectives for nuclear rocket engines to achieve before RIFT would be allowed.|$|R
