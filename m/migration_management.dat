40|$|Hybrid cloud computing, where {{private and}} public cloud {{resources}} are combined and applications can migrate freely, ushers in unprecedented flexibility for businesses. To unleash the benefits, commercial products already enable the live migration of full virtual machines (CPU, memory, disk, network) between distant cloud datacenters. Unfortunately, no live <b>migration</b> progress <b>management</b> system exists, leading to (1) guesswork over how long a migration might take and the inability to schedule dependent tasks accordingly; (2) unacceptable application degradations – application components could become split over distant cloud datacenters for an arbitrary period during migration; (3) inability to balance application performance and migration time – e. g. to finish migration later for less performance interference. Pacer is the first <b>migration</b> progress <b>management</b> system. Pacer’s techniques are based on robust and lightweight run-time measurements of system and workload characteristics, efficient and accurate analytic models for progress predictions, and online adaptation to maintain user-defined migration objectives for coordinated and timely migrations. ...|$|R

GRECO insisted on technical and educational cooperation, the voluntary return of migrants, the channelling of migrants’ remittances to development projects, and finally, on the cooperation with those governments that were ready to accept the returned illegal migrants, as well as to control the exit of their citizens with destination Spain. However, codevelopment was not even mentioned as a policy line in the Immigration law passed in 2000, and did not receive proper funding within the GRECO’s framework.|$|E
