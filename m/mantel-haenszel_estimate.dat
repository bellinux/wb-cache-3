40|$|If {{the same}} {{information}} {{on the distribution of}} risk factors is available for both the general population and a subset distinguished by some disease outcome, it becomes possible to derive relative risk estimates applicable to the entire population with the assurance that the data upon which the estimates are based is representative of that population. To illustrate this approach, data from the 1986 National Mortality Followback Survey and the 1987 National Health Interview Survey were used to compute rate ratios for several causes of death for work in dirtier as compared with cleaner occupa-tions by three methods commonly employed in cohort and case-control studies: the usual standardized rate ratio, the <b>Mantel-Haenszel</b> <b>estimate</b> of the rate ratio, and a multiplicative model fit to an appropriate cross-classification. Properly placed questions in appropriate surveys might very well serve as a substitute for cohort studies and could be performed at less cost and with less overall effort, and completed in a shorter time. Moreover, this approach is less subject to problems of representativeness than cohort and case-control studies.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the areas affected and {{the scale of}} an epidemic of thunderstorm associated asthma {{on the night of}} 24 / 25 June 1994 and to explore the spatial and temporal relationship between the thunderstorm and the associated epidemic. SETTING: The 29 offices of a deputising service for general practitioners' (GP) out of hours calls (Healthcall). At the time of the storm the deputising service provided out of hours cover for about 8500 out of about 30000 GPs in England, Scotland, and Wales. METHODS: Patients who phoned the Healthcall offices to request a home visit were categorised as "asthma" or "other causes" based on their presenting complaint. The number of calls on the night of 24 / 25 June 1994 was compared in areas affected by thunderstorms and areas not affected by thunderstorms and with the night of 17 / 18 June 1994, when there were no thunderstorms. RESULTS: A large area of the south and east of England was affected by an epidemic of asthma closely related both temporally and spatially with the thunderstorms on 24 / 25 June 1994. The pooled <b>Mantel-Haenszel</b> <b>estimate</b> for the risk of asthma in thunderstorm affected areas compared with the control night was 6. 36 (95 % confidence interval 4. 97, 8. 32) compared with a value of 1. 01 (0. 80, 1. 27) for those not exposed. Extrapolation suggests about 1500 extra patients were likely to have requested a visit from a GP that night because of epidemic asthma. CONCLUSIONS: Under certain circumstances thunderstorms are associated with asthma and can affect many patients. Deputising services are a useful source of data for the investigation of epidemics in primary care...|$|E

40|$|In {{epidemiological}} {{and health}} care studies, a common goal is to establish relationships between various factors and event outcomes. But outcome measures such as rates or risks can be biased by confounding. You can control for confounding by dividing the population into homogeneous strata and estimating rate or risk based on a weighted average of stratum-specific rate or risk estimates. This paper reviews the concepts of standardized rate and risk and introduces the STDRATE procedure, which is new in SAS/STAT ® 12. 1. PROC STDRATE computes directly standardized rates and risks by using <b>Mantel-Haenszel</b> <b>estimates,</b> and it computes indirectly standardized rates and risks by using standardized morbidity/mortality ratios (SMR).

40|$|OBJECTIVES—The angiotensin- 1 {{converting}} enzyme (ACE) gene {{is known}} to have two polymorphic alleles I/D. People with the DD genotype {{have been shown to be}} at greater risk of myocardial infarction, but only in some studies. Similar studies in stroke patients also show inconsistent results, but most of these studies have been underpowered to detect a small contribution to stroke risk from the ACE gene. A meta-analysis was undertaken using all known publications of the ACE polymorphism in ischaemic stroke.  METHODS—Two computerised databases were searched for all publications relating to case-control studies using the ACE I/D variant in human ischaemic stroke. Seven association studies were identified and a meta-analysis was conducted using the <b>Mantel-Haenszel</b> <b>estimate</b> for odds ratio (OR) to determine whether the DD genotype predicted outcome in either a genetically dominant or recessive model.  RESULTS— 1918 white subjects (1196 cases and 722 controls) were used in the meta-analysis. There was no difference in ACE genotype (χ 2 = 2. 92, p> 0. 05) or I/D allele frequency (χ 2 = 3. 28, p> 0. 05) in cases or controls. The overall OR for the D allele as an independent risk factor in ischaemic stroke was 1. 31 (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) : 1. 06 - 1. 62, p= 0. 01) under a recessive model, and 1. 14 (95 % CI: 0. 91 - 1. 44, p= 0. 26) under a dominant model.  CONCLUSIONS—This meta-analysis shows that the the D allele, acting recessively, is a modest but independent risk factor for ischaemic stroke onset. Meta-analysis may usefully be employed in allelic association studies for detecting small attributable risks of candidate genes in polygenic disorders. ...|$|E
40|$|Otosclerosis is a {{progressive}} hearing loss {{characterized by an}} abnormal bone homeostasis of the otic capsule that leads to stapes fixation. Although its etiology remains unknown, otosclerosis {{can be considered a}} complex disease. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) was chosen for a case-control association study, because of several non-genetic indications of involvement in otosclerosis. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis in a large Belgian-Dutch sample set gave significant results (P = 0. 0044) for an amino acid changing SNP, T 263 I. Analysis of an independent French population replicated this association with SNP T 263 I (P = 0. 00019). The results remained significant after multiple testing correction in both populations. Haplotype analysis and the results of an independent effect test using the weighted haplotype (WHAP) computer program in both populations were both compatible with SNP T 263 I being the only causal variant. The variant I 263 is under-represented in otosclerosis patients and hence protective against the disease. Combining the data of both case-control groups for SNP T 263 I with a <b>Mantel-Haenszel</b> <b>estimate</b> of common odds ratios gave a very significant result (P = 9. 2 x 10 (- 6)). Functional analysis of SNP T 263 I with a luciferase reporter assay showed that the protective variant I 263 of TGF-beta 1 is more active than the WT variant T 263 (P = 1. 6 x 10 (- 6)). On the basis of very low P-values, replication in an independent population and a functional effect of the protective variant, we conclude that TGF-beta 1 influences the susceptibility for otosclerosis, and that the I 263 variant is protective against the disease...|$|E
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{influences}} related to social mobility, particularly health related behaviours, as one potential {{explanation for the}} social class variation in health among adults. DESIGN: The study is based on questionnaire data from the Adolescent Health and Lifestyle Surveys of 1985, 1987, and 1989. SETTING: The whole of Finland. PARTICIPANTS: A representative sample of 8355 adolescents. The response rate was 79 %. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: The relation between social mobility and health related behaviours among 16 and 18 year old young people was studied. The measure of social mobility {{was based on a}} combination of the social class of origin and achieved social position measured by the present educational status, educational attainment, and labour market position. Three mobility groups were constructed: the downwardly mobile, the upwardly mobile and the stable. Health related behaviours in an upwardly or downwardly mobile group were compared with a stable group from the same social class of origin by calculating relative risks (RR). RRs were assessed by calculating age and sex adjusted rate ratios approximating a <b>Mantel-Haenszel</b> <b>estimate.</b> In logistic regression analyses the independent effects of the social class of origin and the achieved social position were investigated. Most of the nine behaviours studied (smoking, alcohol use, heavy intoxication, coffee drinking, tooth brushing, consumption of sweets, lack of physical exercise, choice of bread spread, and consumption of milk) were related to the direction of mobility so that health compromising behaviours were more frequent among downwardly mobile and less frequent among upwardly mobile young people than their stable peers. Achieved social position proved to determine health related behaviours more strongly than class of origin, thus emphasising the way education facilitates both health values and behaviours as well as the future social position. CONCLUSIONS: The close relation between social mobility and health related behaviours is concluded {{to be a part of}} an explanation of social class differences in health observed among adults...|$|E

Aim To investigate the risk of mortality in a cohort of textile workers and examine whether specific occupational exposures were associated with mortality. Methods Data on members and former members of a textile industry union were extracted from membership cards and matched with the National Death Index to obtain date and cause of death. Exposure to 31 different substances was assessed using a specifically designed job exposure matrix that consisted of profiles of exposures in 11 occupational titles. These profiles were modified according to individual circumstances. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were computed comparing the cohort to the Australian population and <b>Mantel-Haenszel</b> <b>estimates</b> of the rate ratios were computed comparing exposed with unexposed for each of the substances. Results There were 113 deaths in the cohort of 7684 workers. Male and female textile workers had similar risks of death from any cause, cancer or cardiovascular disease to the general Australian population. Male workers had an increased risk of death from injury (SMR = 157, 95 % confidence interval 113 – 213).

This study {{examined}} {{the safety of the}} inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) /LABA combination budesonide/formoterol dry powder inhaler used as maintenance and reliever therapy versus combination treatments based on guideline recommendations. MethodsSafety data from six double-blind, randomised clinical trials (RCTs) in asthma where budesonide/formoterol was used as maintenance and reliever therapy for at least 6 months were reviewed (N= 14   346). All-cause mortality and asthma-related serious adverse events (SAEs) (co-primary endpoints), overall and cardiac SAEs, and discontinuations due to adverse events (DAEs) were assessed. <b>Estimated</b> <b>Mantel–Haenszel</b> (MH) relative risks (RR) with this regimen versus comparators were calculated. ResultsThere was no increase in all-cause mortality with budesonide/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy (four deaths [0. 07 %] versus nine [0. 10 %]; pooled MH RR 0. 70, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 21 – 2. 30). Asthma-related SAEs were reduced with budesonide/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy: 41 (0. 73 %) versus 121 (1. 38 %); pooled MH RR 0. 59, 95 % CI 0. 42 – 0. 85. All-cause and asthma-related DAEs were also reduced with budesonide/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy: pooled MH RR 0. 60 (95 % CI 0. 46 – 0. 79) and 0. 43 (0. 28 – 0. 68), respectively.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is two-fold: (1) to refine {{understanding}} of the relationship between anticonvulsant therapy during the first trimester of pregnancy in women with epilepsy and the risk of congenital malformation among their offspring; and (2) to assess the utility of the Saskatchewan Prescription Drug and Hospital Services databases for studies of maternal drug use and certain reproductive outcomes. In the first meta-analysis the malformation risks {{associated with the use of}} anticonvulsants in general by women with epilepsy were quantified and clarified. Comparison of the congenital malformation risk among offspring of mothers with epilepsy with first trimester anticonvulsant exposure ("exposed") relative to offspring of non-epileptic parents yielded a summary estimate of relative risk (RR) of 2. 6 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 2. 1 - 3. 2). (All RR's in this abstract are study-stratified <b>Mantel-Haenszel</b> summary <b>estimates.)</b> Congenital malformation risk among the offspring of exposed women with epilepsy compared to unexposed women with epilepsy yielded a summary RR of 2. 9 (CI = 2. 0 - 4. 2). No evidence of increased risk to unexposed women with epilepsy compared to non-epileptic women was evident (RR = 0. 9, CI = 0. 5 - 1. 6). In the second meta-analysis the risks associated with specific types of anticonvulsant therapy were qualitatively synthesized. The analysis demonstrated the inadequacies of many study reports [...] vague descriptions of methods often restricted assessment of study quality and incomplete reporting of results as largely responsible for restricting the analysis to 31 studies. Women with epilepsy treated with anticonvulsant monotherapy experienced increased risk of congenitally malformed children relative to both unexposed women with epilepsy (RR = 1. 8, CI = 0. 8 - 4. 8), and unexposed non-epileptic women (RR = 2. 5, CI = 1. 8 - 4. 0). Insufficient data were available to demonstrate statistically significant differences in malformation risk among specific commonly-used anticonvulsant monotherapies, although phenobarbital and carbamazepine appeared to have the lowest risks. Two-drug therapy was associated with a 20 % increase in risk relative to monotherapy, but three-drug therapy was associated with more than twice the risk of one-drug therapy (RR = 2. 2, CI = 1. 3 - 3. 7). Although the potential role of confounding by type and severity of epilepsy could not be evaluated, the analysis suggests that avoiding therapy with three or more anticonvulsants during the first trimester would be prudent. The second component of the thesis was a large record linkage study utilizing information from the databases of Saskatchewan Health. An essentially population-based database of maternal drug use and reproductive outcomes was created which included 104, 534 livebirths and 13, 685 non-livebirth outcomes occurring between April 1977 and March 1984 linked to 299, 152 prescriptions dispensed to the mothers in the year preceding the pregnancy outcome. A study of anticonvulsant use during pregnancy and birth outcome was completed using the created database. The study yielded results with respect to congenital malformation risk generally consistent with the conclusions or the meta-analyses. Evaluation of the database of maternal drug use and reproductive outcomes raised questions about the utility of Saskatchewan Health's databases for pharmacoepidemiologic research into congenital malformations.

40|$|Few {{comparative}} {{clinical trials}} of newer antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) {{in patients with}} refractory partial epilepsy are available. Therefore, meta-analysis is a widely used and useful method for comparing them. Despite the limitations of indirect comparisons, and recognizing that these drugs were tested at different doses, such comparisons can be helpful to physicians making practical treatment decisions. The {{purposes of this study}} were to present newer meta-analysis results for add-on levetiracetam compared with placebo and to estimate its efficacy and tolerability compared with other new AEDs (gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, tiagabine, topiramate, and zonisamide) in a meta-analysis using methods for making indirect comparisons. Randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of add-on therapy with levetiracetam, gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, tiagabine, topiramate, and zonisamide in patients with refractory partial epilepsy were identified in the Cochrane Library 2002. A fixed effects model was used to <b>estimate</b> <b>Mantel-Haenszel</b> odds ratios for the responder rate (efficacy measure) and withdrawal rate (mainly tolerability measure) of levetiracetam and other new AEDs versus placebo. Because no head-to-head clinical trials comparing these new AEDs exist, adjusted indirect comparisons were then made between levetiracetam and each other AED using the meta-analysis results. At the doses tested, levetiracetam was more effective in terms of responder rate than gabapentin (odds ratio 2. 64 with 95 % CI 1. 514. 63) and lamotrigine (odds ratio 1. 86 with 95 % CI 1. 04 - 3. 34) and equally well tolerated. Levetiracetam had a significantly lower withdrawal rate than topiramate (odds ratio 0. 52 with 95 % CI 0. 290. 93) and oxcarbazepine (odds ratio 0. 55 with 95 % CI 0. 33 - 0. 92), with comparable efficacy. Although levetiracetam did not differ significantly from the other AEDs, numerical trends favoring levetiracetam were obtained in response rate and in withdrawal rate (tiagabine, zonisamide). Indirect comparisons based on meta-analysis suggest that add-on therapy with levetiracetam has a favorable responder and/or withdrawal rate relative to several AEDs in patients with partial epilepsy with doses used in clinical trials. These meta-analyses give only short-term efficacy and safety data. Comparative clinical trials and long-term studies of these agents are needed to confirm these findings...|$|R
40|$|Polycythaemia vera and {{essential}} thrombocythaemia are chronic Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms {{that increase the}} risk of arterial and venous thrombosis, as well as bleeding. In addition to the different therapeutic strategies available, an antiplatelet drug is often used to reduce thrombotic risk. To quantify the benefit and harm of antiplatelet drugs for long-term primary and secondary prophylaxis of arterial and venous thrombotic events in patients with polycythaemia vera or essential thrombocythaemia. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), The Cochrane Library (Issue 1 2012), MEDLINE (1966 to 2012), and EMBASE (1980 to 2012), as well as online registers of ongoing trials and conference proceedings. The date of the last search was October 2012. We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing long-term (> 6 months) use of an antiplatelet drug versus placebo or no treatment in participants with polycythaemia vera or essential thrombocythaemia, as diagnosed by established international criteria, with data for {{at least one of the}} selected outcomes. Using a pre-defined extraction form, two review authors independently screened results, extracted data, and assessed quality. We planned to analyse the following outcomes: mortality from arterial and venous thrombotic events (primary efficacy outcome), mortality from bleeding episodes (primary safety outcome), fatal and non-fatal arterial thrombotic events, fatal and non-fatal venous thrombotic events, micro-circulation events, transient neurological and ocular manifestations, major and minor bleeding episodes, and all-cause mortality and any adverse events. We based quantitative analysis of outcome data on an intention-to-treat principle. We used the pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence interval (CI) with a fixed-effect model (<b>Mantel-Haenszel)</b> to <b>estimate</b> the overall treatment effect. We identified no new studies from the updated searches. We included in this review two RCTs for a total of 630 participants. Both RCTs included participants with an established diagnosis of polycythaemia vera and with no clear indication or contraindication to aspirin therapy. We judged both studies to be of moderate quality. Published data from both studies were insufficient for a time-to-event data analysis and for some of the primary and secondary outcomes that we planned. The use of low-dose aspirin, compared with placebo, was associated with a lower risk of fatal thrombotic events (although this benefit was not statistically significant (OR 0. 20, 95 % CI 0. 03 to 1. 14; P = 0. 07). No data on mortality from bleeding episodes were available. A non-significant benefit of aspirin was shown for all-cause mortality (OR 0. 46, 95 % CI 0. 21 to 1. 01; P = 0. 05). No increase in the risk of major bleeding was reported in participants taking aspirin compared with those given placebo (OR 0. 99, 95 % CI 0. 23 to 4. 36; P = 0. 99), and a non-significant increase with aspirin treatment was shown for minor bleeding (OR 1. 85, 95 % CI 0. 90 to 3. 79; P = 0. 09). No published studies have reported findings in participants with essential thrombocythaemia or in the study of other antiplatelet drugs. For patients with polycythaemia vera who have no clear indication or contraindication to aspirin therapy, available evidence suggests that the use of low-dose aspirin, when compared with no treatment, is associated with a statistically non-significant reduction in the risk of fatal thrombotic events and all-cause mortality, without an increased risk of major bleedin...|$|R
40|$|Cervical {{surgery is}} {{associated}} with preterm birth (PTB) and neonatal morbidity. However, it is unknown whether this increased risk {{is due to the}} surgery itself or to the cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) underlying the surgery. Our objective was to assess the risk for PTB in women with treated and untreated CIN. We performed an electronic literature search in MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL for studies that reported on pregnancy outcome after treated and untreated CIN. The methodological quality was scored using the STROBE combined checklist for observational studies. We extracted data on PTB < 37 weeks, very PTB < 32 weeks, spontaneous PTB < 37 weeks, (preterm) premature rupture of membranes ((P) PROM), perinatal mortality and section caesarean each before and after treatment for CIN. We used the <b>Mantel-Haenszel</b> method to <b>estimate</b> summarizing odds ratios. Our search identified 620 studies, of which 20 were reporting on pregnancy outcome for a total of 12, 159, 293 women. There were 20, 832 women who gave birth after treatment for CIN before pregnancy, 52 women who gave birth after treatment for CIN during pregnancy, 64, 237 women with CIN who gave birth before treatment, and 8, 902, 865 women who gave birth without CIN. Compared to women with untreated CIN, women treated for CIN before or during pregnancy, had a significantly higher risk of PTB < 37 weeks (OR 1. 7, 95 % CI 1. 0 - 2. 7). When comparing women treated for CIN before pregnancy (n= 20, 832) to women with untreated CIN (n= 64, 162), we found an OR of 1. 4 with a 95 % confidence interval of 0. 85 - 2. 3. Women treated during pregnancy had a clearly increased risk for PTB (OR 6. 5, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 37), and (P) PROM (OR 1. 8, 95 % CI 1. 4 - 2. 2). In women with cervical surgery, the risks for spontaneous PTB < 37 weeks (OR 0. 87, 95 % CI 0. 54 - 1. 4), caesarean section (OR 1. 0, 95 % CI 0. 71 - 1. 5) and perinatal mortality (OR 1. 0, 95 % CI 0. 38 - 2. 8) were not increased. The increased risk of PTB in women who underwent cervical surgery for CIN is especially increased when performed during pregnancy. When performed before pregnancy the risk of PTB is increased, although insignifican...|$|R
