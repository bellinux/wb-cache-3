60|$|So Reddy Fox crept and tiptoed {{about through}} the old orchard.

5|$|Jones {{decided to}} bring back his other two squads to form a solid line and, expecting to be gone only a few <b>minutes,</b> <b>he</b> left his SCR-300 radio behind. Jones found one squad but the other had gone on farther and was not visible. While he studied the terrain and waited for a {{messenger}} he had sent to bring back that last squad, North Koreans attacked the main company position behind him. Judging by the noise he heard, Jones thought North Koreans had moved in force to the wooded bowl {{between him and the}} rest of the company. Jones never got back to his 3rd Squad. He {{and the rest of the}} platoon dropped down off the ridge into a gully on the left.|$|E

5|$|Pearce {{stars as}} a man who, {{as a result of}} a past trauma, suffers from {{anterograde}} amnesia (the inability to form new memories) and suffers short-term memory loss approximately every five <b>minutes.</b> <b>He</b> is searching for the persons who attacked him and killed his wife, using an intricate system of Polaroid photographs and tattoos to track information he cannot remember. Memento is presented as two different sequences of scenes interspersed during the film: a series in black-and-white that is shown chronologically, and a series of color sequences shown in reverse order (simulating for the audience the mental state of the protagonist). The two sequences meet at the end of the film, producing one complete and cohesive narrative.|$|E
