40|$|The Recast Reception Conditions Directive (RCDr; Directive 2013 / 33 /EU) {{constitutes}} an improvement {{with regard to}} the reception conditions that Member States are required to provide for those seeking international protection. However, it still envisages the possibility for Member States to reduce or withdraw <b>material</b> <b>reception</b> <b>conditions</b> and to grant less favourable treatment to international protection applicants compared to nationals where it is ?duly justified. ? This may potentially lead Member States to grant unacceptably low levels of <b>material</b> <b>reception</b> <b>conditions</b> and could be below what is an adequate standard of living as required under the Directive itself. Using the lens of the right to human dignity, the article examines selected cases of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) and the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in order to see how the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) and the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights (EUCFR) may assist in ensuring that the implementation of the RCDr by the Member States provides for adequate and dignified standard of living conditions for those seeking international protection...|$|E

40|$|This chapter, firstly, retraces the {{legislative}} history and comments on the turbulent negotiations {{that led to the}} adoption of the recast EU Directive in June 2013. It then critically analyses selected aspects of the recast Directive’s content and namely: the scope of the instrument; the detention regime; access to the labour market; level of <b>material</b> <b>reception</b> <b>conditions</b> available and, finally, norms governing the reduction or withdrawal of reception conditions. 13 The analysis is informed by the latest case-law of the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) and that of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), including pending cases. A further section undertakes an overall assessment of the instrument on the basis of three parameters: adherence of the adopted norms with fundamental rights, including the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (CFR); 14 the level of harmonisation achieved by the recast and, finally, the level of coherence between the recast Directive and the other asylum instruments. An ultimate section highlights perspectives that are raised by recent jurisprudence by European Courts and decision-making bodies...|$|E

40|$|This master’s thesis {{evaluates the}} impact of the <b>Reception</b> <b>Conditions</b> Directive, 2003 / 9 /EC, on asylum seekers’ access to EU labour markets. It {{provides}} a comparative analysis between Italy and Germany who, prior to the transposition, had profoundly different standards on <b>reception</b> <b>conditions</b> for asylum seekers. By applying Europeanization theory, such as put forward by Claudio Radaelli, and process-tracing methods, I argue that the <b>Reception</b> <b>Conditions</b> Directive have contributed to improving asylum seekers’ access to the Italian and German labour markets, respectively. I argue that the Europeanization of the Italian and German policies have resulted in a transformation of the Italian <b>reception</b> <b>conditions</b> system, which practically was non-existent prior to transposing the <b>Reception</b> <b>Conditions</b> Directive. In Germany, the Europeanization was considerably less substantive and only resulted in an absorption of the EU-rules, as German <b>reception</b> <b>conditions</b> for asylum seekers were largely in place and functioning at the time of transposition. I establish that, prior to the implementation of the <b>Reception</b> <b>Conditions</b> Directive, there exists evidence of various degrees of both policy and cognitive misfits between the EU-level and national levels. Neither Italy nor Germany had sufficient laws in place securing asylum seekers access to the labour markets, thus constituting political misfits. Article 11 of the <b>Reception</b> <b>Conditions</b> Directive, establishing that asylum seekers cannot be denied access to national labour markets for a longer period than one year, proved at the time to be an improvement of the laws already in place in both Italy and Germany. During EU Council negotiations, Germany succeeded, however, in uploading their demand of allowing favoritism on access to labour markets for EU citizens and nationals across the EU. This is despite the fact that both the European Parliament and the EU Commission desired more favorable conditions for asylum seekers in this area. I argue that changes at the national levels in Italy and Germany have partly been facilitated by NGO’s and civil society groups who play an integral role in managing <b>reception</b> <b>conditions</b> and who have acted as norm entrepreneurs advocating for better access to the labour markets for asylum seekers...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the power}} plants, boiler pipes and heaters, {{are made with}} {{ferritic}} steels low alloy. These steels have a microstructure with fine stable alloy carbides that impede {{the movement of the}} dislocations, however it is inevitable that during long periods of service or very critical conditions, microstructural changes occur that are responsible for the loss of material strength. In the past decades the 1 Cr- 0. 5 Mo steel was used, but it has been replaced by ferritc steels containing higher amounts of Cr and Mo, with the addition of other micro alloying elements such as niobium, titanium and vanadium to increase their mechanical strength. The objective of this work is to study the creep behavior of 1 Cr- 0. 5 Mo steel and to compare its strength when prior to service it is subjected to different heat treatments that improve its conditions of service, as that is beneficial from the economical point of view. Tensile creep tests were performed at a temperature range between 843 and 893 K, and applied stresses between 131 and 205 MPa in the <b>material</b> <b>reception</b> <b>conditions</b> comparing its behavior with others that previously has undergone different heat treatments. From experimental data the characteristic parameters were calculated such as the creep coefficient of stress and activation energy. The microstructural variation of the original material was also analyzed, after heat treatment and creep samples were characterized by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and analysis by dispersive X- ray spectroscopy, to evaluate the effects of kinetics changes occurred in the precipitated phases and the presence of microstructural damage, such as nucleation, growth and coalescence of micro cavities. The microhardness of the phases present in the different samples were also measured...|$|E
40|$|The {{next four}} years will lay the {{premises}} for European asylum legislation and policy for years to come. A radical harmonization process is well underway. Coordinating mechanisms and common Directives have been put into place during the past ten years. Adoption and implementation of EU legislation constitutes the core in this process and will be fully operational by 2010. During 2006, the EU Directive on <b>Reception</b> <b>Conditions</b> was evaluated by the Odysseus academic network of lawyers {{on behalf of the}} European Commission. The current report is compatible with this European comparative study and relates closely to the outcomes of the Odysseus evaluation. The main research questions are: How does the Norwegian reception system stand when compared to the EU Directive on <b>reception</b> <b>conditions?</b> There are two aspects that can be at least analytically distinguished: Firstly, what are the legal sources on <b>reception</b> <b>conditions</b> in Norway and how do they correspond to the EU sources? Secondly: How do the factual <b>reception</b> <b>conditions</b> in Norway compare to the norms of the Direc-tive and the practice in the Member States. Different source of data were used to answer these questions. The study of documents, laws and regula-tions was combined with interviews with civil servants, managers of accommodation centers NGO per-sonell. The general picture that is presented shows that the <b>reception</b> <b>conditions</b> in Norway are in line with the new norms in Europe.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to re-examine the debate about {{cinematic}} motion in terms of the necessity for <b>reception</b> <b>conditions</b> in art. I shall argue that Gregory Currie’s rejection of weak illusionism—the view that cinematic motion is illusory—is sound, because cinematic images really move, albeit in a response-dependent rather than garden-variety manner. In § 1 I present Andrew Kania’s rigorous and compelling critique of Currie’s realism. I assess Trevor Ponech’s response to Kania in § 2, and show that his focus on the cinematic experience is indicative of the direction the debate should take. § 3 demonstrates that the issue is underpinned by the question of the role of <b>reception</b> <b>conditions</b> in the experience of art. In § 4 I apply my observations on <b>reception</b> <b>conditions</b> to the problem of cinematic motion and conclude that Kania’s objections are unsuccessful due to his failure to acknowledge the necessary conditions for cinematic experience...|$|R

40|$|It can {{be argued}} the EU <b>Reception</b> <b>Conditions</b> Directive {{constitutes}} an improvement on international refugee law in that it creates entitlements to welfare for asylum seekers. However, this development is limited in two important respects. First, the Directive has oft en either not been fully implemented or has been poorly implemented, resulting in vast diff erences in practice and inadequate levels of protection across the Union. Second, the eff ect of the EU’s immigration and border control practices is to limit access to EU territory for all migrants, irrespective of their motivations for moving. Migrants’ departure points are being pushed further afi eld and their journeys to the EU are becoming more dangerous.

40|$|When {{installing}} a Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) receiver in a household, {{it is important}} to have a measure of how far the <b>reception</b> <b>conditions</b> are from those leading to errors being noticed on the decoded picture or system failure point. Usually the installer has no means of either evaluating the quality of the transmission channel or estimating the carrier to noise ratio at the input to the receiver. Therefore the noise margin of the DTT installation is unknown. Channel State Information (CSI) is crucial for any DTT receiver to work properly under poor <b>reception</b> <b>conditions.</b> This paper shows how an estimate of the average CSI can be effectively used to characterise the performance of a DVB-T system subject to different types of impairment. A thorough comparison between CSI and other performance indicators gives support to the use of CSI to estimate the noise margin in a DTT installation...|$|R
40|$|Today's {{solution}} to realize wide coverage with the Release 9 MBMS specification is to transmit an H. 264 /AVC video service with a robustness {{determined by the}} worst <b>reception</b> <b>conditions</b> of the target area. This sacrifices service data rate for robustness due to lower modulation and FEC code-rate. The combination of bearer channel multiplex and SVC promises significant gains in terms of channel capacity by establishing unequal error protection on the physical layer. In comparison with single layer transmission, SVC achieves equal performance in terms of continuous playout while allocating fewer resources for the expensive robust channel. This benefit is gained by providing temporary lower quality video to users within bad <b>reception</b> <b>conditions.</b> Simulation results within an MBSFN Release 9 network show significant capacity gains over a given bandwidth with only minor quality degradation for users located in bad reception areas while preserving playout robustness of H. 264 /AVC single layer services...|$|R
