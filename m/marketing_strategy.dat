The rise in punk cynicism made the utopian ideals expressed in progressive rock lyrics unfashionable. Virtuosity was rejected, as the expense of purchasing quality instruments and the time investment of learning to play them were seen as barriers to rock's energy and immediacy.

5|$|Jonathan Nolan {{designed}} the film's official website. As with the <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> of The Blair Witch Project, the website {{was intended to}} provide further clues and hints to the story, while not providing any concrete information. After a short intro on the website, the viewer is shown a newspaper clipping detailing Leonard's murder of Teddy. Clicking on highlighted words in the article leads to more material describing the film, including Leonard's notes and photographs as well as police reports. The filmmakers employed another tactic by sending out Polaroid pictures to random people, depicting a bloody and shirtless Leonard pointing at an unmarked spot on his chest. Since Newmarket distributed the film themselves, Christopher Nolan edited the film's trailers himself. Sold to inexpensive cable-TV channels like Bravo and A, and websites such as Yahoo and MSN, the trailers were key to the film gaining widespread public notice.|$|E

Rockingham's owners attempted to display an advertisement at the 2001 British Grand Prix but the owner of Formula One's commercial rights Bernie Ecclestone cancelled the plan shortly before {{it was due to}} occur. A major <b>marketing</b> <b>strategy</b> took place in response. The advertising, headed by the Michaelides & Bednash agency, began in August in the printed press, and also included two television advertisements and an official poster. The event was affected by drainage problems on the new track which caused the practice sessions to be cancelled. The starting order was set according to the drivers' positions in the points' standings. Its distance was reduced from 210 to 140 laps and was won by Team Penske driver Gil de Ferran after overtaking pole position starter Kenny Bräck on the race's final lap. Most drivers praised the circuit but did not criticise the problem that affected it. Despite two days of practice and qualifying rounds being cancelled because of the drainage issues, 38,000 spectators watched the race. The track later had an extra layer added along with a sealant to allow it to drain water.|$|E
