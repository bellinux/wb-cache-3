40|$|In {{the current}} study, we {{examined}} longitudinally whether {{boys and girls}} differed in pathways from parenting to delinquency. Longitudinal mediational models were tested {{for boys and girls}} separately in which three parenting dimensions (i. e., <b>monitoring,</b> <b>limit</b> setting, {{and the quality of the}} parent-adolescent relationship) were hypothesized to influence adolescents' level of self-control, delinquent attitudes, peer delinquency, and time spent in criminogenic settings, which in turn, were hypothesized to affect delinquency. Using data of 603 adolescents (11 - 17 &#x 00 A 0;years of age at T 1) we found mean level differences between boys and girls in parental monitoring, parental limit-setting, self-control, delinquent attitudes, and peer delinquency. The results suggest furthermore that the model linking parenting to delinquency is similar for boys and girls. We found, however, that the indirect effect from the quality of the parent-adolescent relationship through self-control is stronger for girls than for boys...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{establish}} {{the method of}} gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for {{the determination of the}} cotinine (COT) in human urine. METHODS: The conjugated trans- 3 '-hydroxycotinine (THOC) and COT were hydrolyzed in human urine with beta-glucuronidase. The composition of COT was extracted with the mixture of dichloromethane and n-butyl acetate (2 : 1) and was separated with HP- 5 MS fused-silica capillary column. The GC-MS was used for determining its content. RESULTS: The <b>monitoring</b> <b>limit</b> of this method was 0. 02 microg/L. Its recovery rate was higher than 90 %, Its accuracy rate was 4. 30 %. It was used for the determination of the cotinine in human urine in Guangzhou Biological Bank the Elderly Cohort. CONCLUSION: The GC-MS method is a good microanalysis for monitoring the cotinine in human urine rapidly and accurately with little background disturbance. It has been applied in our Guangzhou Cohort Study for determining cotinine in human urine. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{removal of}} plaque is utmost {{important}} to control dental caries. But in children, factors like lack of dexterity, individual motivation and <b>monitoring</b> <b>limit</b> {{the effectiveness of}} tooth brushing. This necessitates the use of chemotherapeutic agents for control of plaque. Aims: To compare the antimicrobial efficacy of 0. 2 % chlorhexidine mouth rinse and mouth rinse containing 0. 03 % triclosan, 0. 05 % sodium fluoride, and 5 % xylitol in reducing the Mutans streptococcus count in plaque. Materials and Methods: Thirty healthy children aged 8 - 10 years with dmft (decay component) {{of three or four}} were selected. They were divided randomly into two groups: The control or chlorhexidine group and the study group or combination mouth rinse. Both the groups practiced rinsing with respective mouth wash for 1 min for 15 d twice a day. The plaque samples were collected and after incubation Mutans streptococcus count was estimated on the strips from the Dentocult SM kit and evaluated using manufacture′s chart. Statistical Analysis Used: Wilcoxon matched pairs signed ranks test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to analyze the findings. Results: Statistically significant reduction in the Mutans streptococci count in the plaque was seen in the control and study group from baseline level. But when both the groups were compared, the antimicrobial effect of chlorhexidine was more...|$|E

40|$|Process {{monitoring}} {{can prevent}} machine and tool failure in metal-cutting. A successful process monitoring of cutting processes depends on reliable <b>monitoring</b> <b>limits</b> for the process. In industrial applications these limits {{have to be}} generated in a learning phase during a ramp-up process. In order to enable process monitoring for single batch production without a learning phase, this paper describes a simulation based approach for generating reference data to set process limits. As a foundation for calculation of <b>monitoring</b> <b>limits</b> a position-based process simulation has to be established. In a first step an approach of modeling material removal is evaluated to check whether it fits the application for parameterizing the process monitoring. In this context the potentials of a process simulation for calculating process limits are clarified. Additionally the quality of data generated by this kind of simulation is discussed. In a second step a method is described to implement machine properties by a virtual machine tool within a simulation of material removal. For that purpose a method to use actual data of axis position and tool within the simulation of material removal is necessary. With these data a way-based simulation of material removal can generate reference parameters for <b>monitoring</b> <b>limits</b> instead of using data from a learning phase during the ramp-up process. By using position data of a virtual machine tool a reliable source for the actual position of all axes enables the position-based simulation to perform material removal in a more accurate way...|$|R

40|$|An {{agreement}} on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) may place numerical and geographical limits {{on more than}} 140, 000 treaty-limited items (TLIs) 1 in 21 countries. <b>Monitoring</b> <b>limits</b> on such huge numbers of TLIs would be extremely difficult, as well as expensive and intrusive, with human inspectors alone. This chapter examines a promising way to effectively <b>monitor</b> <b>limits</b> while reducing cost and intrusiveness: the tagging of TLIs. The use of tags transforms a numerical limit into a ban on untagged items. The result {{is that many of}} the verification advantages of a complete ban can be retained for a numerical limit. Tagging works by certifying that every TLI observed is one of those permitted under a numerical limit. A tagging system would involve the manufacture of a number of tags equal to the number of TLI, which would then be affixed to an essential part of each allowed TLI. If even one untagged TLI were ever seen—during on-site inspections (OSI), by national technical means (NTM), or even by nationals of the inspected party loyal to the treaty regime—then there would be prima facie evidence of a treaty violation. If properly designed, tags could also identify a TLI as belonging to a particular nation or as normally deployed in a particular region, which would make it easier to verify CFE sub-limits on national and regional deployments...|$|R
