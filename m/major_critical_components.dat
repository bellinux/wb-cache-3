40|$|The LiBr-H 2 O {{absorption}} {{systems are}} used mainly in large cooling capacity applications (industry, large buildings, etc.), therefore require water from cooling towers to reject heat. However, if middle and low capacity are required (commercial and residential systems), absorption machines should be air-cooled {{in order to}} become competitive [1 - 4]. The absorber represents a <b>major</b> <b>critical</b> <b>component</b> in absorption systems and one of the key issues, in it is the combined heat and mass transfer in the absorption process. For this reason the development of mathematical models for the simulation and experimental data for the validation are always useful tools for the design and improvement of falling film vertical absorbers. A testing device has been designed and built for reproducing absorption phenomena in vertical tubes with the primary objective to obtain experimental data in LiBr-H 2 O vertical absorbers.

40|$|Safety in {{aviation}} impacts the overall {{success of the}} sector. It depends on the effectiveness and efficiency of safety management systems (SMSs), which contain diverse and complex elements. Thus, a quantitative methodology for aviation SMS in developing countries, capable of prioritising resources with incomplete information, is needed. Grey relational analysis (GRA) is the most appropriate tool for this situation. This study assessed an existing SMS and determined its critical elements in a developing country’s aviation industry. Questionnaires were framed from the SMS manual of the International Civil Aviation Organization and from previous literature. The robustness and {{the efficiency of the}} approach were tested with data obtained from airline operators in Nigeria. Assessment of SMSs was done among airline service providers ascertaining the important levels of SMS elements. GRA was then applied to this data to identify the most influential elements of an SMS. Several companies were examined. Company A needs for a focus on sharing safety information and sensitization techniques to enable SMSs to better permeate through all levels, making employees aware of their SMS roles and duties to pursue a better safety culture. Company B needs to focus on more in-depth safety information dissemination platforms and methods. Non-punitive reporting should be done and safety promotion, culture, training and education should be prioritised. Company A has a better safety record than B. Overall, from the grey model, 12 critical elements were found out of 22 revised SMS elements that affect SMS. The <b>major</b> <b>critical</b> <b>component</b> was the safety structure and regulation. This is needed to build long lasting and effective SMSs. The novelty of this work is its unique application of GRA for a developing country’s airline safety...|$|R

40|$|Background/Aims: Inflammation is a <b>major</b> and <b>critical</b> <b>component</b> of {{the lung}} {{pathology}} in the hereditary disease cystic fibrosis. The molecular mechanisms of chronic inflammation in cystic fibrosis require definition. Methods: We used several genetic mouse models {{to test a}} role of iNKT cells and ceramide in pulmonary inflammation of cystic fibrosis mice. Inflammation {{was determined by the}} pulmonary cytokine profil and the abundance of inflammatory cells in the lung. Results: Here we provide a new concept how inflammation in the lung of individuals with cystic fibrosis is initiated. We show that in cystic fibrosis mice the mutation in the Cftr gene provokes a significant up-regulation of iNKT cells in the lung. Accumulation of iNKT cells serves to control autoimmune disease, which is triggered by a ceramide-mediated induction of cell death in CF organs. Autoimmunity becomes in particular overt in cystic fibrosis mice lacking iNKT cells and although suppression of the autoimmune response by iNKT cells is beneficial, IL- 17 + iNKT cells attract macrophages and neutrophils to CF lungs resulting in chronic inflammation. Genetic deletion of iNKT cells in cystic fibrosis mice prevents inflammation in CF lungs. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate an important function of iNKT cells in the chronic inflammation affecting cystic fibrosis lungs. iNKT cells suppress the auto-immune response induced by ceramide-mediated death of epithelial cells in CF lungs, but also induce a chronic pulmonary inflammation...|$|R
30|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, the repair of {{existing}} engineering structures using fiber reinforced polymer composites has attracted a great attention by aerospace industry, as it is more economical than replacing new. With an increased use of composite material in aerospace field, it is thus essential to restore the structural integrity by repair of damaged part.

40|$|In some {{electronic}} {{products and}} sculpture crafts, there are possibly vulnerable elements {{that can be}} idealized as cantilever beam type, failure of which will certainly lead the whole product to lose function. Based on the <b>critical</b> <b>component</b> of cantilever beam type, a nonlinear coupling dynamics model between the <b>critical</b> <b>component</b> and the item was established. The computing procedure of the model was designed using finite difference scheme. A numerical example shows that the acceleration changes notably with {{the length of the}} <b>critical</b> <b>component,</b> and the cantilevered end of the <b>critical</b> <b>component</b> is liable to be damaged, because the dynamic stress there is the largest. In this case, the maximum acceleration just cannot serve as the damaged criterion of the packaged goods, only with the maximum stress value. In order to avoid making a mistake, it is necessary to consider the <b>critical</b> <b>component</b> as an elastic element. The maximum stress of the cantilever beam surpasses the proportional limit of elastic components or is not an effective structural strength to determine whether the product loses its functions...|$|R

To evaluate the shock characteristics of the <b>critical</b> <b>components,</b> a new concept of three-dimensional shock response spectrum was proposed. The ratio of the maximum shock response acceleration of the <b>critical</b> <b>components</b> to the peak pulse acceleration, the dimensionless pulse duration, and the frequency parameter ratio of system or the angle of tilted support spring system were three basic parameters of the three-dimensional shock response spectrum.
