5|$|As aforesaid, SVT {{wanted to}} make a good use of Malmo Arena's space to {{highlight}} the performances and increase the audience's visibility compared to previous years. SVT created a main stage and a smaller stage with higher-lower shifted floors, connected by a trail closely surrounded by a standing crowd from both sides of it and around the small stage. The main stage mobility was expressed as a main artistic medium at the opening act of the second semifinal and with highlighting Moldova's performance towards its finish, as a <b>movable</b> <b>part</b> beneath the singer's dress making her look gradually taller. The small stage mobility highlighted United Kingdom's performance towards its finish, lifted above the close-standing audience.|$|E

50|$|Hydroforming is {{a process}} that is {{analogous}} to deep drawing, in that the part is formed by stretching the blank over a stationary die. The force required to do so is generated by the direct application of extremely high hydrostatic pressure to the workpiece or to a bladder that is in contact with the workpiece, rather than by the <b>movable</b> <b>part</b> of a die in a mechanical or hydraulic press. Unlike deep drawing, hydroforming usually does not involve draw reductions—the piece is formed in a single step.|$|E

5000|$|A ball {{check valve}} is a check valve in which the closing member, the <b>movable</b> <b>part</b> to block the flow, is a ball. In some {{ball check valve}}s, the ball is {{spring-loaded}} to help keep it shut. For those designs without a spring, reverse flow is required to move the ball toward the seat and create a seal.

5000|$|The {{halloween}} {{hermit crab}} will grow on average to 2 in in length, which is fairly large {{in comparison to}} other hermit crabs. It has a noticeably flattened pure white shield, approximately [...]315 in long. It is a nocturnal species, and {{has been described as}} [...] "conspicuous". It lives primarily in empty cone shells, mainly those of snails or tritons. Like other hermit crabs, it wears shells in order to protect itself from predators. Its ocular peduncles and antennae are a solid orange and the antennal flagella are transparent. The corneous has parallel ridges on the palm, with similar ridges on the crabs' dactals (the <b>movable</b> <b>part</b> of their pincers). The halloween hermit crab can live for up to 10 years.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{the sophistication}} of the concept, the {{mechanism}} of capacitive switching is physically simple. The <b>movable</b> <b>part</b> ends with a flat foam element {{about the size of}} an aspirin tablet, finished with aluminum foil. Opposite the switch is a PCB with the capacitor pads. When the key is pressed, the foil tightly clings {{to the surface of the}} PCB, forming a daisy chain of two capacitors between contact pads and itself separated with thin soldermask, and thus [...] "shorting" [...] the contact pads with an easily detectable drop of capacitive reactance between them. Usually this permits a pulse or pulse train to be sensed. Because the switch doesn't have an actual electrical contact, there is no debouncing necessary. The keys do not need to be fully pressed to be actuated, which enables some people to type faster.|$|E

50|$|A vacuum {{variable}} capacitor uses {{a set of}} plates made from concentric cylinders that can be slid {{in or out of}} an opposing set of cylinders (sleeve and plunger). These plates are then sealed inside of a non-conductive envelope such as glass or ceramic and placed under a high vacuum. The <b>movable</b> <b>part</b> (plunger) is mounted on a flexible metal membrane that seals and maintains the vacuum. A screw shaft is attached to the plunger, when the shaft is turned the plunger moves in or out of the sleeve and the value of the capacitor changes. The vacuum not only increases the working voltage and current handling capacity of the capacitor it also greatly reduces the chance of arcing across the plates. The most common usage for vacuum variables are in high powered transmitters such as those used for broadcasting, military and amateur radio as well as high powered RF tuning networks. Vacuum variables can also be more convenient since the elements are under a vacuum the working voltage can be higher than an air variable the same size, allowing the size of the vacuum capacitor to be reduced.|$|E
50|$|A {{swing check}} valve or tilting disc check valve is a check valve in which the disc, the <b>movable</b> <b>part</b> to block the flow, swings on a hinge or trunnion, either onto the seat to block reverse flow or off the seat to allow forward flow. The seat opening {{cross-section}} may be perpendicular to the centerline between the two ports or at an angle. Although {{swing check valve}}s can come in various sizes, large check valves are often swing check valves. The flapper valve in a flush-toilet mechanism {{is an example of}} this type of valve. Tank pressure holding it closed is overcome by manual lift of the flapper. It then remains open until the tank drains and the flapper falls due to gravity. Another variation of this mechanism is the clapper valve, used in applications such firefighting and fire life safety systems. A hinged gate only remains open in the inflowing direction. The clapper valve often also has a spring that keeps the gate shut when there is no forward pressure. Another example is the backwater valve (for sanitary drainage system) that protects against flooding caused by return flow of sewage waters. Such risk occurs most often in sanitary drainage systems connected to combined sewerage systems and in rainwater drainage systems. It may be caused by intense rainfall, thaw or flood.|$|E
50|$|Prior to 1917 {{there were}} {{available}} {{several types of}} instruments for measuring and recording pressures internal combustion engine cylinders. Some of these were refinements of the conventional pressure indicator designed for low-speed steam engines while others were designed primarily for high-speed work {{with a view of}} minimizing the effects of inertia. These instruments were found to be useful for various classes of work, depending on theirdesign and characteristics, although none of them had found more than very limited application in a comparatively few laboratories. Some of the inherent difficulties which have prevented the development of a wholly convenient and successful high-speed indicator are inertia, friction, and backlash in moving parts where mechanical means of recording are adopted; inertia and vibration of the system when a photographic method of magnification is applied to an instrument mounted on the engine; time lag of the gases in the connecting tube where a photographic apparatus is mounted independently of the engine and connects to it by a flexible tube; as well as the usual mechanical difficulties in the construction and operation of instruments of this class. It is noted that these difficulties are increased {{in the case of the}} aircraft engine, which usually must be mounted on a more or less flexible stand and in which at best the mechanical vibrations of the parts are excessive, due to their light weight and lack ofrigidity. An important mechanical consequence of this excessive flexibility of the engine structure seems to have been overlooked, since it has not been discussed in the literature or taken account of other than accidentally in design of any indicator. To illustrate this effect, assume an indicator whose moving parts are mounted on the head of an engine cyIinder. In order to reduce the effect of inertia, the range of motion of the piston or diaphragm is reduced as much as practicable and the motion magnified either mechanically or optically so as to give a readable scale. It should be noted that the motion actually recorded is always the relative motion between the <b>movable</b> <b>part</b> of the indicator and the (supposeclIy) fixed partmounted rigidly on the cylinder head. But if the cylinder head itself flexes under pressure or mechanical vibration, this motion of the fixed support relative to the movable piston is recorded and magnified as well as the motion of the piston relative to its support. Hence it may happen that thus limiting the range of motion of the piston or heavy diaphragm and greatly magnifying the record, increases the bad effects of inertia. on a light flexible engine cylinder since the motions of the cylinder head itself, relative to the moving member, are subject to the same degree of magnification.|$|E

Hence, <b>movable</b> <b>parts</b> must be counterbalanced. An instrument which met these criteria is discussed as well as details of construction...|$|R
