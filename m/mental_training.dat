To mitigate this increased risk, <b>mental</b> health <b>training</b> {{programs have been}} developed and implemented in several nations. As part of a coordinated effort, three nations adapted a U.

Implementation of evidence-based programs in a new context is challenging: How much of the original program needs to remain intact in order to retain its utility? User satisfaction rates can provide essential data to assess how well a program is accepted. This article summarizes service member ratings of postdeployment <b>mental</b> health <b>training</b> and compares ratings from service members across four nations. The participating nations (Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and the United States) administered <b>mental</b> health <b>training</b> to active duty military personnel in their respective nations. Following the training, military personnel completed an evaluation of the training. Overall, across the four nations, more than 70 % of military personnel agreed or strongly agreed that they were satisfied with the <b>mental</b> health <b>training.</b> Although some differences in evaluations were observed across nations, components of training that were most important to overall satisfaction with the training were strikingly similar across nations. Fundamentally, it appears feasible that despite cultural and organizational differences, a <b>mental</b> health <b>training</b> program developed in one nation can be successfully adapted for use in other nations...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose a focus for <b>mental</b> health <b>training</b> efforts to better equip {{officers}} to provide interventions and supports to help facilitate improved outcomes for people experiencing mental health crises. Design/methodology/approach: A reflection on key evidence relating to <b>mental</b> health <b>training</b> programmes delivered to police, focussing on Australia, the USA and Canada. Findings: While there are a number of similarities in the core content of <b>mental</b> health <b>training</b> programmes offered internationally, the availability and uptake of training across jurisdictions remains piecemeal and idiosyncratic. Police officers report a strong preference for hands-on experiential learning; this has immediate and direct relevance to their operational duties, and is consistent with core principles of andragogy. While all police employees require <b>mental</b> health <b>training,</b> specialised <b>mental</b> health <b>training</b> programmes should clearly be reserved for a select group of officers who volunteer after acquiring sufficient operational experience. Research limitations/implications: Priorities should centre on measuring the effectiveness of <b>mental</b> health <b>training</b> packages and discerning the active elements associated with changes in police skills and confidence, as well as identifying elements that support improved outcomes for people who experience mental illness and who have contact with the police. Practical implications: Police need to continue to need to seek legitimacy with respect to their guardianship role as <b>mental</b> health interventionists. <b>Training</b> should tap into practice-based wisdom. Training should be practical, applied and reinforced through wider knowledge-based learning and workplace reinforcement. Training is needed for everyone, but specialised training is not for all.

Athletes competing {{at all levels}} of sport are constantly working on ways to enhance their physical performance. Sport psychology research insists there are higher performance results among athletes who incorporate <b>mental</b> skills <b>training</b> into their practice and competition settings. In order to use the mental skills strategies effectively, athletes must be educated about how and when to implement them. Athletes who have a positive experience with <b>mental</b> skills <b>training</b> and strategy use will most likely continue to use them throughout their athletic career. This qualitative phenomenological study describes the <b>mental</b> skills <b>training</b> experiences of NCAA Division II softball catchers and their performance in sport. Ten female collegiate softball catchers (aged 18 - 22) participating at six universities in the Central Region of softball competition, agreed to participate in this study.

Method: The researcher applied an experimental design on this study. The subject were (N= 40) beginners badminton players selected through stratified random sampling from badminton academy at Petaling Jaya. The subjects were divided on four equal groups with each groups consisted of n= 10 Players. The control groups were restrained from conducting any physical or mental imagery trainings. The other groups used combination of physical, mental imagery, visual and verbal training methods. Result: The results of paired sample t test had showed significant differences for all experimental groups between pre and post tests. The results also shown that there is significant different (F= 3. 42, p< 0. 031) in physical training in combination with mental imagery and verbal stimulus group than the other physical and <b>mental</b> imagery <b>training</b> groups. Findings: The findings suggested that combination between physical <b>training</b> and <b>mental</b> imagery <b>training</b> with verbal stimulus increased the accuracy and speed of basic badminton skills.

60|$|In {{the first}} place, I am {{convinced}} that not one man in ten thousand or in a hundred thousand is a genuine, chemical dipsomaniac. Drinking, as I deem it, is practically entirely a habit of mind. It is unlike tobacco, or cocaine, or morphine, or {{all the rest of}} the long list of drugs. The desire for alcohol is quite peculiarly mental in its origin. It is a matter of <b>mental</b> <b>training</b> and growth, and it is cultivated in social soil. Not one drinker in a million began drinking alone. All drinkers begin socially, and this drinking is accompanied by a thousand social connotations such as I have described out of my own experience in the first part of this narrative. These social connotations are the stuff of which the drink habit is largely composed. The part that alcohol itself plays is inconsiderable when compared with the part played by the social atmosphere in which it is drunk. The human is rarely born these days, who, without long training in the social associations of drinking, feels the irresistible chemical propulsion of his system toward alcohol. I do assume that such rare individuals are born, but I have never encountered one.|$|E
