60|$|We would impress {{upon the}} {{student at the}} outset the {{importance}} of some preliminary reading before dissection is undertaken. No one would dream of attempting to explore a deserted city without some previous study of maps and guide-books, but we find again and again students undertaking to explore the complicated anatomy of a vertebrated animal without the slightest, or only the slightest, preparatory reading. This is entirely a mistake. A student should {{be familiar with the}} nomenclature of the structures he contemplates examining, he should have some idea of their mutual relations and functions, or his attention will inevitably be diverted by the difficulty of new names and physiological questionings to the neglect of his dissection, and that careful observation of form and <b>mutual</b> <b>position</b> which is the essential object of dissection. On the other hand, it is equally necessary-- perhaps more so-- to warn students against the bookish fallacy, and to assure them of the absolute impossibility of realizing biological facts from reading alone. Practical work can alone confirm and complete the knowledge to which the text-book is the guide. In scientific teaching it may sometimes be convenient for the thought to precede the thing, but until the thing has been dealt with the knowledge gained is an unsatisfactory and unstable possession.|$|E
40|$|We employ Positioning Theory in a reanalysis of {{data from}} postconflict {{reconciliation}} conversations between Jo Berry, whose father {{was killed in an}} IRA bombing, and Patrick Magee, who planted the bomb. The analysis shows how discourse activity simultaneously positions not just the Self and the Other as individuals, but also in dialogic relation to each other, whereby multilayered identities are revealed, negotiated, and shifted. This article has several aims. First, it introduces the new construct, Empathic <b>Mutual</b> <b>Positioning,</b> to describe a key dynamic in reconciliation through which mutual recognition and understanding is made possible for both speakers. It shows how Empathic <b>Mutual</b> <b>Positioning</b> drives the process of reconciliation, and how it evolves and changes as conciliation proceeds. The article illustrates the three functions of Empathic Mutual Positioning: expansive, embracing, and reflexive, and it argues that Empathic <b>Mutual</b> <b>Positioning</b> is a key, distinctive, and essential component in reconciliation processes. As an intentional commitment to conciliation it operates as a force, {{but it is also a}} dynamic psychic process in that it changes the people involved while unfolding. Second, the article discusses the potential benefits of applying Empathic <b>Mutual</b> <b>Positioning</b> as a strategic approach to conciliation by mediators engaged in reconciliation practice. Mediators can encourage, support, or exploit Empathic <b>Mutual</b> <b>Positioning</b> to scaffold the process and support participants at difficult points in the conciliation. Finally, it discusses how this new concept, Empathic <b>Mutual</b> <b>Positioning,</b> relates to the Positioning-Interests-Needs model widely used in mediated practical work in conflict resolution/transformation...|$|R

She was really getting somewhat febrile in her excitement; and now in this drive through the park her usual susceptibility to changes of light and scenery helped to make her heart palpitate newly. Was it at the novelty simply, or the almost incredible fulfilment about {{to be given to}} her girlish dreams of being [...] "somebody"--walking through her own furlong of corridor and under her own ceilings of an out-of-sight loftiness, where her own painted Spring was shedding painted flowers, and her own fore-shortened Zephyrs were blowing their trumpets over her; while her own servants, lackeys in clothing but men in bulk and shape, were as nought in her presence, and revered the propriety of her insolence to them:--being in short the heroine of an admired play without the pains of art? Was it alone the closeness of this fulfilment which made her heart flutter? or was it some dim forecast, the insistent penetration of suppressed experience, mixing the expectation of a triumph with the dread of a crisis? Hers was one of the natures in which exultation inevitably carries an infusion of dread ready to curdle and declare itself.|$|E

Or a benefactor's veto might impose such a negation on a man's life that the consequent blank might be more cruel than the benefaction was generous. I am merely using strong illustrations. In the present case I am unable to take your view of the bearing which my acceptance of occupation--not enriching certainly, but not dishonorable--will have on your own position which seems to me too substantial to be affected in that shadowy manner. And though I do not believe that any change in our relations will occur (certainly none has yet occurred) which can nullify the obligations imposed on me by the past, pardon me for not seeing that those obligations should restrain me from using the ordinary freedom of living where I choose, and maintaining myself by any lawful occupation I may choose.

50|$|There {{are various}} types of {{potential}} energy, each associated with {{a particular type of}} force. For example, the work of an elastic force is called elastic potential energy; work of the gravitational force is called gravitational potential energy; work of the Coulomb force is called electric potential energy; work of the strong nuclear force or weak nuclear force acting on the baryon charge is called nuclear potential energy; work of intermolecular forces is called intermolecular potential energy. Chemical potential energy, such as the energy stored in fossil fuels, is the work of the Coulomb force during rearrangement of <b>mutual</b> <b>positions</b> of electrons and nuclei in atoms and molecules.

5000|$|In the 1910s Carlism was {{dominated}} by a conflict between the claimant and the key party theorist, Juan Vázquez de Mella. At a first glance Minimismo and Mellismo seemed alike: both favored parking dynastical issues and forging a grand, Traditionalism-centred Right-wing alliance. However, scholars differ when discussing <b>mutual</b> <b>position</b> of the two concepts. Some name Minguijón a key protagonist of [...] "sector promellista", highlighting their shared penchant for a conservative bloc; others note rather that Minguijón followed de Mella by firmly incorporating the social dimension into the doctrine. Some students, however, suggest that Minguijón opposed [...] "catastrofismo mellista" [...] by working towards a constructive solution. They highlight that Minguijón seemed inclined towards politics within the Alfonsist framework, while de Mella adopted a decisively anti-system stance with no dynastical commitments. One more difference was that unlike a fiercely Germanophile de Mella, during the Great War Minguijón adopted a pro-Entente stand and even considered setting up a pro-French daily.|$|E
5000|$|According to the {{so-called}} centroid hypothesis, judgments of distance between visual objects are strongly affected by the neural computation of centers-of-masses (centroids) of the luminance profiles of the objects (i.e., the position of centroid of an image determines its perceived location). As suggested by Morgan et al. , visual procedure of centroid extraction is causally related to a certain integration of neural activations (spatial pooling of the positional signals) evoked by the neighboring object parts. Though the integration reduces {{the ability of the}} visual system to determine accurately the <b>mutual</b> <b>position</b> of image elements (i.e., coarsens the positional acuity), such pooling seems to be quite biologically substantiated since it allows fast and reliable assessment of the location of the visual object as whole, irrespective of its size, the shape complexity, and illumination conditions. Concerning the Müller-Lyer and similar illusions, the pattern of neural excitation evoked by contextual flank (e.g., the Müller-Lyer wings themselves) overlaps with that caused by the stimulus terminator (e.g., the wings apex), thereby leading (due to the shift of the centroid of summed excitation) to its perceptual displacement (these positional changes are apparent in Dynamic Müller-Lyer Illusion by Gianni A. Sarcone, particularly with gaze fixation on any of the terminators). The crucial point in the centroid explanation regarding the positional shifts of the stimulus terminators in direction of the centers-of-masses of contextual flanks was confirmed in psychophysical examination of illusory figures with rotating distractors [...] The relative displacement of all stimulus terminators leads to misjudgment of distances between them; that is, the illusion occurs as a side effect due to necessarily low spatial resolution of the neural mechanism of assessment of the relative location of the visual objects. Unlike most other approaches, the centroid explanation is based on a relatively small set of assumptions and is capable of making quantitative predictions that can be immediately and purposefully tested in experiments {{with a wide variety of}} stimuli modifications. This quantitative approach offers not only some general trends, but also reveals a certain [...] "fine structure" [...] of the illusion magnitude changes , what is still unattainable for most of other widely accepted explanations of illusions of extent of the Müller-Lyer type.|$|E
