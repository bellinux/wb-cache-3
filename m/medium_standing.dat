40|$|Identification {{of waste}} {{characteristics}} {{is an important}} step towards improving waste recovery. The aim of this research was to determine the physical and physico-chemical characteristics of waste of Abomey–Calavi city and to study the relationship between standard of living and average ratio of daily waste generated by each person. In this study the methodology used French standards to characterize particle size and typology of solid waste generated by the population of Calavi City in Benin, West Africa. According to home criteria, the study area was stratified into three distinct levels of standard of living called: high standing, <b>medium</b> <b>standing</b> and low standing; Waste from 60 households was weighed daily. The total waste produced by each household was collected seven (7) days a week, for a period of three weeks. Waste characterization was performed using ratio, size granulometry and typological composition. Physico- Chemical analysis including organic mater, pH, Total Organic Carbon, total Kjeldahl nitrogen and metal trace element were also performed. To better assess waste compostability, water extractable organic matter was quantified and qualitative identification was made with XAD 8 and XAD 4 resins. Results show that the amount of waste increases with the standard of living; the average ratio of daily waste generated is 0. 89 kg day- 1 person- 1 . Independently of the standard of living, fermentable compounds represent the largest proportion of waste materials (45 %). Qualitative difference of waste content in organic matter is shown {{as a function of the}} population’s living standards. These results could be explained by a higher consumption of meat in the households with a higher standard of living, reflecting a greater proportion of transphilic (TPI), and hydrophilic (HPI) fractions. The C/N ratio is lower in the high standing households than in low ones. Metal trace element analysis showed a low but still significant pollution, whereas high iron and alu minum concentrations were found in all standings. In conclusion we propose a strategy for waste management in Abomey-Calavi based on sorting at the source to eliminate plastic waste and valorization of wastes via composting...|$|E

30|$|In {{microfluidic}} {{devices that}} use acoustic forces for sorting and manipulation, standing wave-type interaction is more popular. Acoustic forces from travelling waves are rarely used in such devices. Pressure waves, identical {{to each other}} both in frequency and magnitude, generated by acoustic devices in mutually opposite directions through a viscous <b>medium</b> form <b>standing</b> waves contained multiple nodes and anti-nodes. The nodes are regions where summation of opposite pressure waves results in zero pressure fluctuation regions. The anti-nodes are regions experiencing alternating minimum pressure and maximum pressure fluctuations. These regions separate and capture particles/cells with varying acoustic contrast factor (i.e., compressibility and density of particles and medium) into either nodes or anti-nodes [29, 30, 32, 68 – 73].|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{optimization}} {{and use of}} ICP-AES with slurry nebulization for {{the direct}} analysis of ZrO 2 -powder is described. The powder samples are dispersed in water, acidified to pH 2 and the slurry is fed into a Babington nebulizer. The effects of grain size, pH of the suspending <b>medium</b> and <b>standing</b> time on {{the stability of the}} slurry are discussed. For the optimization of the ICP operating conditions, a simplex technique is applied and for this purpose three types of objective functions were examined. Identical behaviour of slurries and solutions with the same matrix concentrations in the ICP-AES is achieved for powders with particle sizes lower than 10 ?m; in the latter case calibration can be performed by standard addition with aqueous solutions. The detection limits for Al, B, Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Na, Ti, V. Y are 0. 03 ?g/g to 10 ?g/g and the standard deviation is generally lower than 10 %. Six commercially available ZrO 2 powders are analyzed by slurry nebulization ICP-AES and the results were found to agree well with those obtained by ICP-AES after chemical decomposition of the samples. © 1992 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
50|$|Gen's {{fighting}} style incorporates various kung fu {{styles that}} he has utilized in his assassinations. As of Street Fighter Alpha 2, this {{is reflected in the}} ability to switch between two fighting styles during gameplay: Mantis (Sou) and Crane (Ki). Gen is at his best with both styles utilized in tandem, often switching between Mantis and Crane mid-attack; however, this makes him a difficult character to learn and master, and his low stun and stamina leave even less room for error. Gen's two styles use opposite approaches: The Mantis style focuses on ground-based pressure, spacing, and approaching, with special attacks that can act as solid reversals, among other defensive functions. The more offensive Crane style uses a multi-angle approach, with normal and special moves tailored to confuse and punish foes, and unique standard normals (such as an overhead <b>standing</b> <b>medium</b> punch and low-hitting standing heavy punch). In the Street Fighter Alpha series, Gen and Guy are the among only characters to retain their 'natural' Chain Combo abilities, and both would carry this trait into later appearances.|$|R
40|$|We {{construct}} an idealized universe for didactic purposes. This universe {{is assumed to}} consist of absolute Euclidean space and {{to be filled with}} a classical medium which allows for sound waves. A known solution to the wave equation describing the dynamics of the <b>medium</b> is a <b>standing</b> spherical wave. Although this is a problem of classical mechanics, we demonstrate that the Lorentz transformation is required to generate a moving solution from the stationary one. Both solutions are here collectively referred to as "spherons". These spherons exhibit properties which have analogues in the physical description of matter with rest mass, among them de Broglie like phase waves {{and at the same time}} "relativistic" effects such as contraction and a speed limit. This leads to a theory of special relativity by assuming the point of view of an observer made of such spheronic "matter". The argument made here may thus be useful as a visualisation or didactic approach to the real universe, in which matter has wave-like properties and obeys the laws of special relativity.

40|$|Non-motor symptoms, such as fear {{of falling}} and anxiety, are {{frequently}} reported in Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent evidence of anxiety and fear directly influencing balance control in healthy young and older adults, raises the question whether {{fear of falling}} and anxiety also directly contribute to the balance deficits observed in PD. The goal {{of the current study}} was to examine whether PD patients and controls responded similarly or differently to experimentally induced increases in anxiety. For this purpose, 14 PD patients (tested during a subjective optimal ON state) and 16 healthy age-matched control subjects stood in three conditions of different levels of postural threat: normal threat (quiet standing at ground level); <b>medium</b> threat (<b>standing</b> {{at the edge of a}} surface elevated to 80 cm); and high threat (same, but to 160 cm). Outcome measures included mean position, mean power of frequency (MPF) and root mean square (RMS) of centre of pressure (COP) displacements in the anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) directions. Physiological and psychosocial measures of fear and anxiety were also recorded. Increased threat changed postural control similarly in PD patients and controls; MPF of AP and ML COP increased and the mean COP position was shifted backward in both groups. These results indicate that during the ON state, static balance in PD patients and controls is equally susceptible to the influence of anxiety. Significant correlations observed between COP changes and measures of fear and anxiety provide evidence to support the proposed neural links between structures controlling emotion and postural control. Future studies should further address this issue by including more severely affected patients, by testing the influence of dopaminergic medication, by including more anxious patients, and by using dynamic measures of balance...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of laser}} beams as {{excitation}} {{sources for the}} characterization of semiconductor nanowires (NWs) is largely extended. Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) are currently applied {{to the study of}} NWs. However, NWs are systems with poor thermal conductivity and poor heat dissipation, which result in unintentional heating under the excitation with a focused laser beam with microscopic size, as those usually used in microRaman and microPL experiments. On the other hand, the NWs have subwavelength diameter, which changes the optical absorption with respect to the absorption in bulk materials. Furthermore, the NW diameter is smaller than the laser beam spot, which means that the optical power absorbed by the NW depends on its position inside the laser beam spot. A detailed analysis of the interaction between a microscopic focused laser beam and semiconductor NWs is necessary for the understanding of the experiments involving laser beam excitation of NWs. We present in this work a numerical analysis of the thermal transport in Si NWs, where the heat source is the laser energy locally absorbed by the NW. This analysis takes account of the optical absorption, the thermal conductivity, the dimensions, diameter and length of the NWs, and the immersion <b>medium.</b> Both free <b>standing</b> and heat-sunk NWs are considered. Also, the temperature distribution in ensembles of NWs is discussed. This analysis intends to constitute a tool for the understanding of the thermal phenomena induced by laser beams in semiconductor NWs...|$|R
40|$|We have {{identified}} a new gene encoding the G protein α subunit, gna- 3, from the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. The predicted amino acid sequence of GNA- 3 is most similar to the Gα proteins MOD-D, MAGA, and CPG- 2 from the saprophytic fungus Podospora anserina and the pathogenic fungi Magnaporthe grisea and Cryphonectria parasitica, respectively. Deletion of gna- 3 leads to shorter aerial hyphae and premature, dense conidiation during growth on solid <b>medium</b> or in <b>standing</b> liquid cultures and to inappropriate conidiation in submerged culture. The conidiation and aerial hypha defects of the Δgna- 3 strain {{are similar to those}} of a previously characterized adenylyl cyclase mutant, cr- 1. Supplementation with cyclic AMP (cAMP) restores wild-type morphology to Δgna- 3 strains in standing liquid cultures. Solid medium augmented with exogenous cAMP suppresses the premature conidiation defect, but aerial hypha formation is still reduced. Submerged-culture conidiation is refractory to cAMP but is suppressed by peptone. In addition, Δgna- 3 submerged cultures express the glucose-repressible gene, qa- 2, to levels greatly exceeding those observed in the wild type under carbon-starved conditions. Δgna- 3 strains exhibit reduced fertility in homozygous crosses during the sexual cycle; exogenous cAMP has no effect on this phenotype. Intracellular steady-state cAMP levels of Δgna- 3 strains are decreased 90 % relative to the wild type under a variety of growth conditions. Reduced intracellular cAMP levels in the Δgna- 3 strain correlate with lower adenylyl cyclase activity and protein levels. These results demonstrate that GNA- 3 modulates conidiation and adenylyl cyclase levels in N. crassa...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of a novel radiator capable of producing ultrasonic waves in air and liquids has been investigated. For commercial transducers when operating in air or liquids, impedance matching is the necessary condition for maximum transfer of energy to the <b>medium</b> (thus no <b>standing</b> waves are involved). 'However, "for this radiator {{the formation of the}} mechanical standing waves on it is the key condition for directional radiation of energy into the surrounding environment. Under this condition the radiator exhibits a practical conversion of electrical energy into ultrasound. To further improve the {{performance of}} the radiator. the wavelength coincidence condition must be satisfied. This condition implies that the wavelength of the bending vibration developed on the blade to be the same as that in the medium to which it is coupled. Consequently, an end-fire radiation pattern is obtained. The theory of this when applied to water and also for a double blade configuration are presented. The main component of the radiator consists. of a cantilever blade on which a pair of piezoelectric (PZT) ceramic bars are fixed. These the so called excitation gauges, are fixed on both sides of a thin rectangular metal blade near the clamped end. When wavelength coincidence condition is fulfilled, the radiator transmits ultrasonic wave in a highly directional pattern. The direction of propagation of ultrasound is solely steered by frequency of the applied signal. System imperfections such as inter modal coupling when used underwater are considered. An analytical approach is developed to investigate the performance of the radiator for transmission of digital signals in air as well as in water. This method is used to evaluate the efficiency of the device as a suitable means for communication between divers or a diver and an underwater stationary station. Amplitude modulation of speech signals demonstrated the capabilities of a new underwater transmission. system whose narrow beam width is the condition to obtain power gain and performance. The possibility of the same system {{to be used as a}} passive sonar is also examined. Finally, simulations of the above system to be implemented in beam-forming in air and in water have been developed...|$|R
