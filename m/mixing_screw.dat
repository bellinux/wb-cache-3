40|$|Ultrasonic {{diagnostic}} method of screw behavior during extrusion has been designed, developed, {{and carried out}} on a 63. 5 -mm single screw extruder, equipped with either a basic conveying screw or a <b>mixing</b> <b>screw.</b> It {{was found that the}} screw behavior depends on the screw speed and the die pressure. Whereas initially at low speed, the screw centered by the hydrodynamic forces rotates smoothly in the axial position, at higher screw speeds and high die pressures the screw starts vibrating. Thus, (1) the screw tip vibrated with the amplitude of 102 ̆ 013210 3 ̆bcm as the screw speed varied from 5 to 100 revolutions per minute; (2) the screw vibrations in the vertical and horizontal directions were asymmetrical; (3) the vibration pattern repeated itself at every two revolutions; (4) the vibrations originated in the poorly aligned engagement in the gearbox sleeve when the screw was pushed deeply into it by backpressure; (5) once pushed in the screw oscillated at any screw speed or die pressure.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2013 Günümüz madenciliğinin en büyük problemlerinden biri olan atık bertarafı birçok ekonomik ve çevresel olumsuzluklara neden olmaktadır. Özellikle metalik sülfürlü cevherlerin üretimi sonucu sülfür içeriği yüksek atığın meydana geldiği durumlarda, su ve oksijen varlığında sülfürlü minerallerin oksidasyona uğraması, asidik su oluşumuna ve atık içindeki metallerin çözünmesine neden olarak çevre kirliliğine yol açmaktadır. Bunun yanısıra atıkların yeryüzünde veya deniz derinliklerinde depolanması ekonomik olarak maden şirketleri için külfet olmaktadır. Günümüzde nispeten yeni ve kullanımı Avustralya ve Kanada’da yaygın olan, macun dolgu sistemi yardımıyla, atıklar yer altında kontrollü bir şekilde depolanabilmektedir. Bu sistem sayesinde atıkların tamamına yakını çevre kirliliğine yol açmadan yeraltına güvenli bir şekilde yerleştirilmektedir. Ayrıca macun dolgu sistemi yeraltında güvenli çalışma ortamları sağlaması ve yeryüzündeki meydana gelen tasman hareketlerini en aza indirmesi açısından da büyük önem arz etmektedir. Tanım olarak macun dolgu, cevher hazırlama tesisinden atık olarak elde edilen ve pasa olarak da adlandırılan, sınıflandırılmamış tesis atığının, macun dolgu tesisinde belirli oranlarda su ve bağlayıcı maddeler eklenerek karıştırılması sonucu oluşan ve yeraltı boşluklarını doldurmaya yarayan homojen dolgu malzemesidir. Macun dolgu içeriğini % 70 - 85 arasında atık, su, bağlayıcı ve kimyasal katkı maddeleri oluşturur. Eczacıbaşı ESAN’a ait Balya Kurşun-Çinko madeni tesis atığının macun dolgu olarak kullanılabilirliliği üzerine araştırmalar bu çalışma kapsamında gerçekleştirilmiştir. İlk olarak atığın fiziksel, kimyasal ve mineralojik özelliklerini belirlemek amacıyla piknometre, tane boyut dağılımı, Atterberg limit deneyleri ile XRD ve XRF gibi deneyler yapılmıştır. Daha sonra atığın yeraltında dolgu malzemesi olarak kullanılabilirliliğine ilişkin olarak, laboratuvar ortamında 12 farklı reçeteye bağlı karışımlar hazırlanarak 340 adet numune hazırlanmış ve dolgu malzemesinin mekanik özellikleri araştırılmıştır. Bu araştırmanın temel amacı, macun dolgu olarak kullanılması düşünülen atığın yeraltı açıklıklarının doldurulmasında başarılı bir şekilde uygulanabilirliğinin anlaşılmasıdır. Farklı kür süreleri sonucunda dolgu malzemeleri üzerinde tek eksenli basınç dayanımı ve elastik modül deneyleri gerçekleştirilerek yeraltında uygulanabilir en uygun karışımın tasarımı yapılmıştır. Buna ek olarak macun dolgu kullanılan maden işletmelerinden uyarlama yaparak örnek macun dolgu tesisi planlanmıştır. Nowadays, waste {{disposal}} {{which is the}} most crucial problem for mining leads to not only environmental, but also economical problems. Especially, the high sulfur content of waste from the production of metallic sulphide ores causes environmantal pollution. Moreover, storage of waste {{in the depths of the}} earth or the sea is the economic burden for mining companies. Last three decades, waste can be stored in the ground in a controlled manner by pastefill which is common to use in Australia and Canada, even though it is a relatively new system. The main purpose of this study is the understanding of applicability of the pastefill which is used to fill underground openings successfully. In the underground metal mining, paste fill which consists of dimensionless waste of mineral processing plants, waste of power plants, sand or aggregate, water, binders and various chemicals is a mixture of fluid consistency. Definition of pastefill according to Brackebusch is typically a low permeability, high density solids mixture of aggregate solids and water containing at least 15 % by weight fines material at sizes ranging between minus 20 &# 956;m to 45 &# 956;m content. Pastefill is created % 70 - 85 of waste, water and chemical addictives. Generally, portland cement is used as a binder in the mixture of paste fill. If the rate of sulphate which leads to reduct the long period performance of paste fill is high, sulphate resisting portland cement should be used as a binder. Artificial or natural pozzolans such as fly ash can be used in the mixture of paste fill as a binder so as to decrease the cost of cement, because it is the most vital part of the operating cost. Through this system, almost all waste can be disposed underground safely without causing environmental pollution. In addition, underground paste backfill system to provide safe working environments and minimize the movement of the earth subsidence occurred. Field of study operating in a Lead-Zinc Mine belongs to Eczacibasi Group in Balya, Balıkesir. According to offical records, the area of mine is 2. 900 hectares. Mining operation in Balya Lead-Zinc Mine began production in 2009. Average 240. 000 tons crude ore are producted per year. 30. 000 tons of crude ore is proucted as a ore concentrate. The samples of Balya Metal Mine on bright sections under a microscope show that respectively galena, pyrite, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, tetrahedrite, magnetite, pyrrhotite, stibnite, rsenopyrite, boulanjerit, jamesonit, bismutite can be seen. Amount of galena, {{which is the most}} common matel in that mine, increases towards the upper levels. The result of researches, proven and probable reserve of lead and zinc are calculated as an approximately 3. 043. 300 tons. Average grade is calculated as 9, 1 %. Sublevel filling Method is applied to the western galeries. Ore which is seperated by 15 meter pieces is produced by 5 meter slices. 35 -meter galeries are excavated so as to get 5 -meter vertical distance. All excavated galleries are filled with fillers. When the production of ore is completed in these galleries, if there is another gallery under these galleries, these galleries are filled with 8 % filler. Depending on the width of the ore, if a gallery will be excavated next to the completed gallery, completed gallery are filled with 6 % filler. If there are not any gallery next to the completed gallery, completed gallery are filled with waste or is not filled. Transportation of the ore which is blasted is maintained by shovels and trucks. Ore arrives from underground to surface approximatly 30 - 45 minutes. Shotcrete and rock bolt (split set) are used in Balya Lead-Zinc Metal Mine in order to increase the resistance of the floor and prevent probable accident. There is a mineral processing plant in Lead-Zinc Mine. That plant is used for flotation of lead and zinc. An excavated ore is tranported with the band to the crushers. A jaw crusher and two cone crushers are used in order to crush. Two ball mills are used for grinding. This thesis is about the availability of the plant waste for using pastefill material. First of all, 2 different wastes were transported from Balya Metal Mine to the Rock Mechanics Laboratory at Mining Faculy in Istanbul Technical University. Next step is to define characteristics of these wastes. Grain size distribution tests were done for 2 different wastes multiple times so as to determine physical characteristics of them. Average value of these tests are demonstrated in this thesis as size distrubition graphics. Likewise, pycnometer tests were done for them 5 times in order to determine their density. Moreover, Atterberg Limit Tests, such as Liquit Limit and Plastic Limit Tests, were done so as to realize their physical behaviour. All of those tests were done at Rock Mechanics Laboratory of Mining Faculty in Istanbul Technical University. All results of those experiments are shown at tables in this thesis. Besides determining physical characteristics, some experiments were done in order to determine chemical characteristics of 2 different wastes at Geochemistry Laboratory of Mining Faculty in Istanbul Technical University. XRF experiments were conducted so as to determine their chemical characteristics multiple times. Average value is shown on tables. Furthermore, XRD tests were conducted for 2 different wastes to investigate their minerological properties. Results of tests are shown as graphics in this thesis. After determining physical, chemical and minerological characteristics by experiments, 12 different prescriptions were prepared for each wastes. Every prescription has a different cement ratio and slump value. Totally 24 prescriptions were prepared and also 5 different curing time were decided, respectively 7, 14, 28, 42 and 56 days. Then, 340 mixtures were prepared depend on 24 different prescription in order to investigate mechanical properties and determine Uniaxial compressive stress tests results and elastic modulus. Thus, it can be designed the most suitable mixture depends on prescriptions. Before preparing specimens, all waste were dried with drying oven for 24 hours at 105 °C. After that, waste, cement and water were weighed with balance. Then balanced materials were mixed with mixer until having a homogeneous mixture. After that, all homogeneous mixtures were tested so as to determine slump value. If the slump value is suitable for prescription, these mixtures are filled with scoop in a sampling vessel. Before filling pastefill into the sampling vessel, sampling vassel must be lubricated. Before curing time, sample must take out from the sampling vessel in order to prepare Uniaxial compressive stress test. All samples were encoded one by one. Before the uniaxial compressive stress tests, all samples were capped with cyclinder capping test set. Capping materials are mixtures of 70 % sulphur and 30 % graphite. These mixtures were prepared in a melting pot. After capping, at the end of the appropriate curing times, all samples were done Uniaxial compressive stress tests with a stiff test machine. After these experimental studies, results are demonstrated as graphics with the help of the Ms Excel and also all results are shown as tables. Before and after the tests, photos of samples were taken for archieving. At the end of the 340 tests, the best prescription was chosen depends on the results of stiff test machine. Furthermore, pilot pastefill plant is design by some metal mines in the world which are used pastefill system. Some machines are neccessary for preparing pastefill such as storage mechanism, dewatering equipments (cyclones and filter disks), weight belt, fluidization silo, mixer and <b>mixing</b> <b>screw,</b> binder silo,hopper, pump mechanism – pipeline – borehole. All machines must be new technology. Pastefill should checked after preparing it with quality control system. Quality control is so vital for pastefill system. Lack of this system might lead to some problems such as wrong paste concentrations, barricade problems and transportation problems. Even though pastefill system has some drawbacks, its advantages outweigh its disadvantages. For example, although capital cost of pastefill is expensive, operating cost of pastefill is cheaper than other systems. If we think about processing for five years, cost of pastefill will be cheaper than other filling system and storage of waste on surface. Binder content can also be reduced with pastefill system. Moreover, almost all waste can be disposed underground safely without causing environmental pollution. It can be clearly seen that pastefill is both an environmental friendly system and also beneficial economically for mining industry. Pastefill system will be more economic with the help of the advanced technology. Therefore, scientists should make more reseach about pastefill system. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E

Due to their characteristic properties, the nanocomposites are nowadays being increasingly used for the engineering applications, and certainly will have {{a significant role in}} the materials production in the future. An important class of nanocomposite materials are polymer layered silicates, in which the layered filler (mostly modified natural clay minerals) is dispersed in the polymer matrix. Many of parameters (i. e., type of polymer matrix, type and amount of nanofiller, and a number of process parameters as melting temperature, screw speed, number and shape of <b>mixing</b> <b>screws,</b> etc) affect properties of nanocomposites. As part of the paper, the samples of PA 12 /nanoclay nanocomposite mixture were made by adjusting various parameters (content of nanoclay, the screw rotation frequency and mixture temperature).

The mathematical models that show dependence of tensile properties on the mixture parameters were obtained as the result of analysis. POLYM. COMPOS., 37 : 684 - 691, 2016.

Complementary arrays of surface structures, such as 1 D ridges or fibrils arranged in a 2 D lattice, can inter-digitate to achieve adhesion enhancement controlled by shape recognition. It has been shown that relative misorientation is accommodated by defects that are meso-scale screw dislocations. The arrangement of such dislocations plays a critical role in determining the mechanical properties of the interface. Here we study the geometric properties of one-dimensional (ridge/channel) and two-dimensional (arrays of pillars) shape-complementary interfaces in the presence of relative misorientation (twist) and difference in lattice spacing. Relative misorientation without difference in lattice spacing is accommodated by arrays of screw dislocations. Difference in lattice spacing without misorientation is accommodated by arrays of edge dislocations. In general, we observe arrays of dislocations with <b>mixed</b> <b>screw</b> and edge character. The spacing and orientation of these arrays can be predicted accurately using the geometry of Moiré patterns. More broadly, we show that soft materials with shape-complementary patterns {{can be used to}} generate meso-scale dislocations of arbitrary edge and screw character at the length scale of tens of microns.

40|$|The linear and {{nonlinear}} oscillatory shear, extensional {{and combined}} rheology-dielectric spectroscopy of hybrid polymer nanocomposites for semiconductive applications were investigated in this study. The main focus was {{the influence of}} processing conditions on percolated poly(ethylene-butyl acrylate) (EBA) nanocomposite hybrids containing graphite nanoplatelets (GnP) and carbon black (CB). The rheological response of the samples was interpreted in terms of dispersion properties, filler distortion from processing, filler percolation, {{as well as the}} filler orientation and distribution dynamics inside the matrix. Evidence of the influence of dispersion properties was found in linear viscoelastic dynamic frequency sweeps, while the percolation of the nanocomposites was detected in nonlinearities developed in dynamic strain sweeps. Using extensional rheology, hybrid samples with better dispersion properties lead to a more pronounced strain hardening behavior, while samples with a higher volume percentage of fillers caused a drastic reduction in strain hardening. The rheo-dielectric time-dependent response showed {{that in the case of}} nanocomposites containing only GnP, the orientation dynamics leads to non-conductive samples. However, in the case of hybrids, the orientation of the GnP could be offset by the dispersing of the CB to bridge the nanoplatelets. The results were interpreted in the framework of a dual PE-BA model, where the fillers would be concentrated mainly in the BA regions. Furthermore, better dispersed hybrids obtained using <b>mixing</b> <b>screws</b> at the expense of filler distortion via extrusion processing history were emphasized through the rheo-dielectric tests...|$|R

Usually these polymer-based prototypes are lacking in thermal and electrical conductivity. Graphene (Gr) has attracted impressive enthusiasm {{in the recent past}} due to its natural mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties. This paper presents the step by step procedure (as a case study) for development of an in-house ABS-Gr blended composite feedstock filament for fused deposition modelling (FDM) applications. The feedstock filament has been prepared by two different methods (mechanical and chemical mixing). For mechanical <b>mixing,</b> a twin <b>screw</b> extrusion (TSE) process has been used, and for chemical mixing, the composite of Gr in an ABS matrix has been set by chemical dissolution, followed by mechanical blending through TSE. Finally, the electrical and thermal conductivity of functional prototypes prepared from composite feedstock filaments have been optimize...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis work aims at {{simulation}} by particle {{tracking the}} local residence time distributions (RTDs) of a co-rotating twin-screw extruder using computational fluid dynamics. Simulated results follow reasonably well {{the trend of}} experimental results obtained by an in-line measuring instrument for different screw configurations and feed rates. To analyze the distributive mixing performance and overall efficiency {{of different types of}} kneading discs (KDs), mixing parameters such as area stretch ratio, instantaneous efficiency, and time-average efficiency are calculated. Among KDs with stagger angles 45 °, 60 °, and 90 °, the 90 / 10 / 64 with disc gaps is most efficient in terms of distributive mixing. The effects of the disc width and disc gap on the local RTD and distributive mixing are also discussed. This provides a numerical tool for assessing point-by-point information on the local RTD, flow, and <b>mixing</b> along the <b>screw</b> extruder. POLYM. ENG.

40|$|Polymer {{extrusion}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important polymer processing techniques. Modelling of the phenomena developing inside single screw extruders enabled the development of commercial software which can be used to study the performance of existing systems and to define the equipment characteristics for new applications. Although mixing {{is one of the}} most important performance measures of extrusion, it is usually disregarded in the available programs. Consequently, in this work mathematical models for quantifying <b>mixing</b> in single <b>screw</b> extruders are developed and subsequently inserted in a global computer modelling program of single <b>screw</b> extrusion. The <b>mixing</b> model quantifies distributive and dispersive mixing and coalescence mechanisms in a liquid-liquid system. This is accomplished by calculating the variation of the thickness of drops considered to be suspended in the polymeric matrix, taking into account the rate and drop break-up time and the coalescence probability. The influence of several parameters, such as viscosities, initial drop dimension, screw speed and barrel temperature, are examine...|$|R
40|$|The mapping {{method is}} a {{powerful}} simulation tool to optimize distributive mixing inside periodic mixers. Recently, a new approach of the mapping method was introduced to simulate distributive mixing inside dynamic, complex geometries in an open flow system (twin-screw extruders). Here we apply this approach of the mapping method to different mixing elements, both kneading and <b>screw</b> <b>mixing</b> element (SME), inside a twin-screw extruder. The accuracy of the mapping method depends on {{the accuracy of the}} velocity field and these accurate 3 D velocity fields are here calculated using an extended finite element method. For the kneading elements a variety of staggering angles have been investigated, and the mixing performance of the SME element is compared with a standard conveying element. To better quantify the mixing performance, additional parameters like particle trajectories, residence time distribution and the volume-integrated, intensity of segregation are used as a mixing measure.

40|$|International audienceIn this work, {{we present}} first results of {{high-resolution}} EBSD for ice with a spatial resolution down to 0. 25 μm. The study highlights {{the potential of}} EBSD to significantly increase our understanding of deformation and annealing processes associated with the build-up of internal stresses due to strain incompatibility between grains. Two polycrystalline samples were analyzed: a natural sample of polar ice from the Vostok ice core (Antarctica) and an experimentally deformed sample of laboratory grown columnar ice. In summary, we observe the following: (1) inhomogeneous deformation through the grains is translated into lattice distortions that are concentrated mainly at grain boundaries and triple junctions (natural and experimental sample), (2) these distortions may be continuous (natural and experimental sample) or may form distinct tilt boundaries and sub-grains of 10 – 50 μm size (experimental sample). These form mainly by rearrangement of basal edge dislocations into low-energy configurations (i. e. tilt boundaries) in various prism planes. Continuous lattice distortions originate from <b>screw</b> or <b>mixed</b> edge and <b>screw</b> dislocations lying in the basal plane...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the development of}} cross-correlation based high resolution electron backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD) and electron channelling contrast imaging (ECCI), in the scanning electron microscope (SEM), to quantitatively map the strain variation and lattice rotation and determine the density and identify dislocations in nitride semiconductor thin films. These techniques can provide quantitative, rapid, non-destructive analysis of the structural properties of materials with a spatial resolution of order of tens of nanometers. HR-EBSD has a sensitivity to changes of strain and rotation {{of the order of}} 10 − 4 and 0. 01 ° respectively, while ECCI can be used to image single dislocations up to a dislocation density of order 1010 cm− 2. In the present work, we report the application of the cross-correlation based HR-EBSD approach to determine the tilt, twist, elastic strain and the distribution and type of threading dislocations in InAlN/AlN/GaN high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) structures grown on two different substrates, namely SiC and sapphire. We describe our procedure to estimate the distribution of geometrically necessary dislocations (GND) based on Nye-Kroner analysis and compare them with the direct imaging of threading dislocations (TDs) by ECCI. Combining data from HR-EBSD and ECCI observations allowed the densities of pure edge, <b>mixed</b> and pure <b>screw</b> threading dislocations to be fully separated...|$|R
