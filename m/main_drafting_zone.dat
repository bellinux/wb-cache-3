The process parameters were optimized in the break <b>drafting</b> <b>zone</b> with pressure bar of the INA-V spinning frame, the drafting principle in the break <b>drafting</b> <b>zone</b> with pressure bar of INA-V spinning frame was analyzed, and the sliver configuration was observed in the break <b>drafting</b> <b>zone</b> with pressure bar. The result revealed that installed the pressure bar in break <b>drafting</b> <b>zone</b> after, when the roving twist factor was small, CV%, thinness, thickness and neps of the yarn spun decrease as the break drafting ratio increase; when the twist factor of roving was larger, the break draft ratio as 1. 3 time was optimum drafting conditions.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} technological parameters of spinning of 100 % CV Vortex yarns of different counts and its selected geometrical parameters (a lead of helix of wrapping fibre ribbon, yarn diameter) as well as yarn properties. The number of twist of wrapping fibre layer is determined. The effect of the yarn delivery speed, hollow spindle diameter, and the <b>main</b> <b>draft</b> on the hairiness, mass irregularity, tenacity, elongation, resistance to abrasion and bending rigidity of Vortex yarn is observed. The yarn properties are compared with the properties of open-end rotor spun yarns. Slivers of the same spinning lot {{were used for the}} production of both kinds of yarn. The results showed that the delivery speed in combination with spindle diameter affects yarn diameter, hairiness and abrasion resistance. Mass irregularity and imperfections of yarn is mainly affected by the <b>main</b> <b>draft</b> of drafting unit. Technological parameters of spinning do not affect the level of bending rigidity of the Vortex yarn. Tested rotor spun yarns had a larger diameter, higher hairiness, lower tenacity and higher elongation, lower mass irregularity and number of imperfections, higher abrasion resistance and lower bending rigidity compared to tested Vortex spun yarns...|$|R

40|$|A peloton may {{be defined}} as two or more cyclists riding in {{sufficiently}} close proximity to be located either {{in one of two}} basic positions: 1) behind cyclists in zones of reduced air pressure, referred to as 'drafting', or 2) in zones of highest air pressure, described here alternately as 'riding at the front', 'in the wind', or in 'non-drafting positions'. Cyclists in <b>drafting</b> <b>zones</b> expend less energy than in front positions. Two broad models of peloton dynamics are explored. The first is an energetic model that describes peloton dynamics that oscillate through observable phase states as they emerge from collision avoidance and riders' coupled energy outputs. These phases exhibit behavioural characteristics such as convection patterns and synchronization, among others. Under the second, economic model, we discuss some basic parameters of the peloton as a system of economic exchange, and identify the resources within a peloton for which riders compete and cooperate. These include the energy savings of drafting, a near-front positional resource, and an information resource. Comment: 16 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, 1 Appendi...|$|R

Certain features of the turbulence are found to depend more on stability than on the external situation. Three general types of turbulence are found: 1) intermittent turbulence driven by shear-driven overturning; 2) continuous turbulence where strong drafts {{in the presence of}} shear are characterized by sharp boundaries or microfronts, particularly on their upstream sides; and 3) weaker continuous turbulence. The costructure fields are generally consistent with vertical gradient transfer. However, the bora turbulence on larger scales is dominated by horizontal motions perpendicular to the mean shea...|$|R

50|$|The <b>main</b> <b>drafting</b> sets of four nibs came in two kinds: Gold and Silver. The Silver was for rough tracing paper, and the Gold was for {{plastic film}} (velograph or durables). Drawing boards changed {{as a result}} of {{technical}} pens—a hard (not spongy) surface was required, and when plastic film was used, the static attraction between plastic cursors, T-squares, set-squares etc. meant that as one lifted the edge from the film, the film would rise through static attraction and the ink would blot. The solution was to stick down a plastic sheet (Osalid) that attracted the film more strongly than the drafting instruments. The tracing paper or velograph sheet would be placed on the Osalid sheet stuck onto the drawing board and the air brushed away. Brushing charged the surface, and the film would then be taped taut (but released {{at the end of each}} working day to allow for overnight temperature expansions and contractions).|$|R
40|$|Conventional ring {{spinning}} {{is known as}} traditional spinning system and it is most widely used system in textile industry. Despite being the most prevalent system and supplying approximately 60 % of short-staple yarn production, {{there are still some}} limitations as lower production rate, longer production flow and higher production costs. That is why, researches in textiles started to accelerate to develop alternative spinning systems. Siro-spun spinning system which is an important type of twist spinning, had been developed with the aim of reducing yarn manufacturing costs by eliminating plying and twisting processes in the production flow. The main principle of Siro-spun spinning is to feed two parallel fibre strands in <b>drafting</b> <b>zone</b> and allow these two fibre strands twist together on each other when they leave the front roller. In this study, it was aimed to compare the properties of two ply yarns produced by {{ring spinning}} system and Siro-spun spinning system. For this purpose, properties of Ne 40 / 2 yarns made of cotton, Tencel, polyester and micro Modal were analysed. Results showed that Siro-spun yarns have lower hairiness and unevenness than ring-spun yarns, besides mechanical properties of both spinning systems are approximate. Besides the advantages in terms of production costs, it can be also concluded that Siro-spun spinning system is a strong alternative of conventional system in terms of many yarn characteristics...|$|R
