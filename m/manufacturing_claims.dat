In automated storage and retrieval systems, this new approach leads to revise storage assignment policies, so that the least energy can be consumed by cranes for unit load movements. Dedicated energy-based policies and related zone shapes are analysed with particular attention to the role of unit load weight and the design option of rack stratification from floor to ceiling. Energy performance of dedicated, class-based, and random storage policies are then compared for different demand curves and rack shape. In order to enhance flexibility while maximising energy efficiency, new dynamic energy-based policies are also introduced and evaluate...|$|E

Next, the study deals with exhaust manifold’s materials and with present basic principles of thermodynamic and hydrodynamic. Then two parametric models were modelled in Solidworks software. First model was made according to existing exhaust manifold of engine 1, 4 TSI. It was symmetrical model (collector in the axis). For second parametric model the collector was moved in horizontal direction, so this model is asymmetrical. Both models were evaluated considering their complexity of structural design and their <b>manufacturing</b> <b>claims.</b> Finally the possibility of CFD analysis for evaluation of parametric models was studied...|$|E

40|$|A typical {{decision}} of automated storage and retrieval systems planning is the dwell point location, {{which is the}} position where the idle crane should {{wait for the next}} operation. This problem has been traditionally studied in literature by optimizing picking time, traditionally considered as the main performance in warehouse management. The new paradigm of sustainable <b>manufacturing</b> <b>claims</b> for a change of perspective by fostering energy efficiency. In this paper the dwell point location is studied not only from the traditional time based point of view, but also from the energy-based one. The optimal time-based dwell point location is compared to the optimal energy-based one in terms of both time and energy performances when adopting a dedicated storage policy. A factorial design of experiments is applied in order to analyze how the demand ABC distribution of items, shape of the rack, and the allocation strategy could affect energy and time performances...|$|E
40|$|Sustainable <b>manufacturing</b> <b>claims</b> {{for more}} energy {{efficient}} operations in warehouse management. In AS/RSs {{they can be}} pursued by optimizing storage and retrieval cycles so that the least energy is required to move the crane. While picking operations have been traditionally optimized {{in order to minimize}} picking times directly linked to the service level perceived by customers, a sustainable approach leads to change this perspective by optimizing storage and retrieval cycles to lower energy requirements. In this paper we propose an energy-based heuristic to re-sequence retrievals in order to perform dual command cycles with the least energy requirements. Impact on both energy savings and round trip times is assessed when moving from single command to dual command cycles, if storage and retrieval operations are combined by the common first-come first-served policy. Further improvements on energy and time performances achievable by adopting different re-sequencing heuristics are then investigated. Factors affecting energy consumption and round trip times such as the storage allocation strategy, the re-sequencing time-based or energy-based policies, the demand distribution, and the shape of the rack, are analyzed by a 24 factorial design of experiments...|$|E

40|$|The {{business}} case {{needs to be}} improved {{in order to make}} carbon fibre composites useful for the automotive industry. It is often claimed that one of composite greatest advantages over metals is the ability to be manufactured in large complex integral geometries. By reducing the number of tools and avoiding or minimising the assembly processes, an integral solution is commonly seen as more cost effective. In high volume <b>manufacturing</b> these <b>claimed</b> advantages might be questioned. This paper presents an investigation of how complexity and size of a structure affect the manufacturing design choice between integral and differential design. The study is based on a conceptual cost model with a part cost and assembly module for carbon fibre composite manufacturing. The result shows that an integral design solution is not necessary the most cost effective option. Instead, dependent of the size and complexity of the part a divided structure may both minimise total material cost and tool cost. QC 20150410 </p...|$|R
