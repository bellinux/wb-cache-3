40|$|A {{control law}} for an Integrated Power/Attitude Control System (IPACS) for a {{satellite}} {{is presented in}} this paper. Four non-coplanar <b>momentum</b> <b>wheels</b> in a special configuration, {{and a set of}} three thrusters are used to implement the torque inputs. The <b>momentum</b> <b>wheels</b> are used as attitude control actuators, as well as an energy storage mechanism, providing power to the spacecraft. In that respect, they can be used to replace the currently used heavy chemical batteries. The thrusters are used to implement large torques for large and fast (slew) maneuvers and provide for the momentum management strategies. The <b>momentum</b> <b>wheels</b> are used to provide the reference-tracking torques and the torques for speeding up or slowing down the wheels for storing and releasing kinetic energy. The attitude tracking controller published in a previous work is adopted here. Power tracking for charging and discharging the <b>momentum</b> <b>wheels</b> is added to complete the IPACS framework. The torques applied by the <b>momentum</b> <b>wheels</b> are decomposed into two spaces which are perpendicular to each other, with the attitude control torques and power tracking torques in each space. This control law can be easily incorporated in an IPACS system on-board a satellite. The possibility of occurrence of singularities, where no arbitrary energy profile can be tracked, is studied for the wheel cluster considered in the paper.

50|$|A further {{advantage}} over <b>momentum</b> <b>wheels</b> and control moment gyroscopes {{is the absence}} of moving parts and therefore significantly higher reliability.|$|R
50|$|A control moment {{gyroscope}} (CMG) is {{a related}} but {{different type of}} attitude actuator, generally consisting of a <b>momentum</b> <b>wheel</b> mounted in a one-axis or two-axis gimbal. When mounted to a rigid spacecraft, applying a constant torque to the wheel {{using one of the}} gimbal motors causes the spacecraft to develop a constant angular velocity about a perpendicular axis, thus allowing control of the spacecraft's pointing direction. CMGs are generally able to produce larger sustained torques than RWs with less motor heating, and are preferentially used in larger and/or more-agile spacecraft, including Skylab, Mir, and the International Space Station.|$|E
50|$|These are rotors spun at {{constant}} speed, {{mounted on}} gimbals to provide attitude control. Although a CMG provides control {{about the two}} axes orthogonal to the gyro spin axis, triaxial control still requires two units. A CMG {{is a bit more}} expensive in terms of cost and mass, because gimbals and their drive motors must be provided. The maximum torque (but not the maximum angular momentum change) exerted by a CMG is greater than for a <b>momentum</b> <b>wheel,</b> making it better suited to large spacecraft. A major drawback is the additional complexity, which increases the number of failure points. For this reason, the International Space Station uses a set of four CMGs to provide dual failure tolerance.|$|E

50|$|ExoCube is also {{equipped}} with an attitude control system that allows for instrumental positioning and satellite stability. For control, ExoCube is fitted with two deployable booms with brass masses located at their ends. This allows for gravity-gradient stabilization that helps align the satellite into the proper orientation in two axes within ±10°. Further fine-tuning of the satellite’s orientation is performed by magnetorquers. These devices utilize generated magnetic fields from a current, which interact with the Earth’s magnetic field to orientate the satellite. This will allow the satellite’s scientific payload to take proper measurements. The satellite also has a 10-mNm <b>momentum</b> <b>wheel</b> from Sinclair Interplanetary that provides roll and yaw axes coupling for gyroscopic stability.

50|$|The {{spacecraft}} was 3-axis stabilized with a <b>momentum</b> <b>wheel</b> {{that was}} used to establish stability about the nominal rotation, or z-axis. The orientation of the z-axis could be altered over a period of hours using magnetic torque coils that interacted with the Earth's magnetic field. Solar panels charged batteries during the daylight portion of each orbit, so that SAS 3 had essentially no expendables to limit its lifetime beyond the life of the tape recorders, batteries, and orbital drag. The spacecraft typically operated in a rotating mode, spinning at one revolution per 95-min orbit, so that the LEDs, tube and slat collimator experiments, which looked out along the y-axis, could view and scan the sky almost continuously. The rotation could also be stopped, allowing extended (up to 30 min) pointed observations of selected sources by the y-axis instruments. Data were recorded on board by magnetic tape recorders, and played back during station passes every orbit.|$|E
5000|$|A {{reaction}} wheel is sometimes operated as (and referred to as) a <b>momentum</b> <b>wheel,</b> by operating it {{at a constant}} (or near-constant) rotation speed, in order to imbue a satellite with {{a large amount of}} stored angular momentum. Doing so alters the spacecraft's rotational dynamics so that disturbance torques perpendicular to one axis of the satellite (the axis parallel to the wheel's spin axis) do not result directly in spacecraft angular motion about the same axis as the disturbance torque; instead, they result in (generally smaller) angular motion (precession) of that spacecraft axis about a perpendicular axis. This has the effect of tending to stabilize that spacecraft axis to point in a nearly-fixed direction, allowing for a less-complicated attitude control system. Satellites using this [...] "momentum-bias" [...] stabilization approach include SCISAT-1; by orienting the momentum wheel's axis to be parallel to the orbit-normal vector, this satellite is in a [...] "pitch momentum bias" [...] configuration.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the most}} famous {{rationale}} being used is the AMBAC system, it is referenced in various other series including Macross. Within the Gundam series, the AMBAC system term is also used in Mobile Suit Gundam 00. [...] Active Mass Balance Auto-Control (AMBAC) is a fundamental technology that allows for thrusterless manoeuvring in the zero-G environment of space by mobile suits by means of precise movement control of their limbs in the Gundam universe. AMBAC works by leveraging Isaac Newton's Third Law of Motion (when there's an action there is an equal and opposite reaction) with regard to inertia to effect changes in direction. Mobile suits performing AMBAC motions would presumably move similarly to present-day astronauts performing extra-vehicular activity: both typically having roughly similar body structure, their use of that mass to control their rotation would presumably be similar, even if calculated by different means. AMBAC is by its nature limited to re-orienting the unit about its center of mass, and is not a substitute for propulsion. It is often used in conjunction with the propulsion system to quickly turn the unit and shorten aiming speed as well as directing the main thrusters. The system is similar in principle to the <b>momentum</b> <b>wheel</b> system used in present-day satellites, though obviously more complex and allows the centre of mass move outside of the unit.|$|E

Furthermore, the satellite was able to follow low earth orbit satellites through slewing, by tracking the low earth-orbit satellite through an S-band RF sensing. The system was also able to perform orbitography of the tracked satellite, and was a precursor to the operational system TDRSS.This highly advanced (for the time) pointing subsystem used earth and sun sensors, a star tracker pointed to the pole star, Polaris, and three inertial sensors. The sensor measurements were fed to two digital computers (nominal and redundant), as well to a back-up analog computer. It was also possible to orient the satellite by using radio-frequency sensors.

A key feature of this work is the systematic use of modern geometric mechanics, including methods based on symplectic geometry, Lie symmetry groups, reductions, lagrangian mechanics and hamiltonian mechanics to investigate specific Eulerian manybody problems.
