40|$|A {{light-weight}} {{optical sensor}} {{has been developed}} for the simultaneous measurements of stratospheric trace gases. Its measuring principle {{is based on the}} detection of sunlight intensity with a miniature spectrometer. The wide spectral coverage of the miniature spectrometer offers the possibility for measurements of trace gases which absorb within the UV-VIS wavelength range, e. g. O 3, NO 2, and BrO. The new sonde can be operated at any place and is suitable for field-work due to the low weight of the payload (1. 7 kg) and the autonomous portable telemetry system. In a first application ozone profiles were retrieved of the irradiance measurements with an adapted Dobson-spectrometer algorithm.

Its seasonal variation shows a broad spring/summer maximum in the troposphere. The contribution of photochemical ozone production and transport from the stratosphere to this seasonal variation are studied by a correlative analysis of ozone concentrations and meteorological variables, {{with emphasis on}} potential vorticity. This analysis shows the impact of dynamical and photochemical processes on the spatial and temporal ozone variability. In particular, a positive correlation (r = 04. 0, significance greater than 99. 9 percent) of ozone with potential vorticity is observed in the middle troposphere, reflecting the impact of stratosphere-troposphere exchange on the vertical ozone distribution...|$|R

40|$|In the Balloon Ozone Intercomparison Campaign (BOIC), {{several in}} situ UV {{absorption}} photometers, two solar UV absorption photometers, <b>electrochemical</b> <b>sondes,</b> and a mass spectrometer were intercompared in three flight missions. Concurrent data from Umkehr and satellite observations are also intercompared. The National Bureau of Standards provided a 'standard' ozone source for intercomparing the in situ instruments and ground pressure. Preliminary {{findings indicate that}} the standard deviation of the sensitivities among 17 instruments against the NBS reference was about 11 percent. These differences appear in flight at the lower levels and change at higher altitudes, indicating height-dependent errors. The difference among five in-situ UV photometers flown together ranged by plus or minus 8 percent during ascent to about 41 km. During float at 42 km, the difference nearly doubled. During descent, the difference decreased to about 4 percent, which is {{much closer to the}} expected accuracy of these instruments. Results from UV solar radiometers have been systematically higher than those from UV photometers by 15 to 20 percent - a very important disagreement that needs to be resolved...|$|R

A comparison was made with ozone soundings at middle northern latitudes (Lindenberg 52. 21 °N, 14. 12 °E). During polar spring, the period of extreme ozone depletion, a double peak structure was typical at 71 °S.

40|$|During the Airborne Antarctic Ozone Experiment from 28 August to 30 September 1987 near UV zenith {{scattered}} sky {{measurements were}} made over Antarctic from the NASA DC- 8 aircraft using a one third m spectrograph {{equipped with a}} diode-array detector. Scattered sky light data in the wavelength range 348 nm to 388 nm was spectrally analyzed for O 3, NO 2, OClO, and BrO column abundances. Slant column abudances of O 3, NO 2, OClO and BrO were determined, using a computer algorithm of non-linear and linear least square correlation of Antarctic scattered sky spectra to laboratory absorption cross section data. Using measured vertical <b>electrochemical</b> <b>sonde</b> ozone profiles from Palmer, Halley Bay, and the South Pole Stations the slant columns of O 3 were converted into vertical column abundances. The vertical column amounts of NO 2, OClO, and BrO were derived using vertical profiles calculated by a chemical model appropriate for Antarctica. NO 2 vertical column abundances show steep latitudinal decrease with increasing latitude for all 13 flights carried out during the mission. In the regions where NO 2 abudances are low, OClO and BrO were observed. The spatial and temporal vertical column abundances of these species {{are discussed in the}} context of the chemistry and dynamics in the antarctic polar vortex during the austral spring...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} measure {{simultaneously}} vertical profiles of ozone and further trace gases (e. g. NO 2), which are relevant in stratospheric ozone chemistry, {{we have developed}} a new balloon-borne optical sonde. Its measuring principle {{is based on the}} detection of sunlight intensity with a miniature spectrometer over a wide wavelength range (200 850 nm) during the ascent. A control unit in the sonde evaluates and preprocesses the data already on-board. Every ten seconds parts of the measured spectrum, meteorological values, and GPS information are transmitted to the ground. Height-dependent column densities of the considered trace gases can be determined using radiative transfer calculations and their inversion leads to the vertical concentration profiles. The implementation of new light-weight components and innovative techniques results in an payload weight of 2 kg, thus reaching up to 40 km altitude with comparable small balloons. It can be operated by a two-men team and is suitable for field-work with limited logistic possibilities. The new sonde closes the gap between the <b>electrochemical</b> <b>sonde</b> ECC, the world-wide standard for routine ozone measurements, and sophisticated optical sensors used on large size stratospheric balloons. Due to the necessary logistics, these balloon experiments are very expensive and can only be carried out from special balloon launching facilities. During {{the first half of this}} year various test measurements will be performed to thoroughly check the overall technique and the analysis algorithm. We will present the detailed measurement concept, and show first results obtained during the measurements...|$|R
40|$|Regular balloon ozone {{soundings}} with <b>electrochemical</b> <b>sondes</b> {{have been}} performed at Uccle since 1969. More than 450 ozone soundings between 1985 and 1989 were {{used to calculate the}} altitudes Zs from the VIZ radiosonde data and the altitudes Zr deduced from the tracking of the balloon train with a primary wind-finding radar. The values of Zs at fixed times appeared to be systematically too low as compared to Zr. The differences Zr-Zs increase with altitude; at 30 km the annual mean values of Zr-Zs (plus or minus standard deviation) vary between 590 plus or minus 910 m and 1410 plus or minus 1160 m, according to the pressure calibration of different manufacturing series of radiosondes. From these results it is found that around the 30 km level the ozone concentrations calculated from soundings with VIZ sondes are too low by 7. 5 to 14 percent, depending upon the manufacturing series of radiosondes. At least part of the discrepancy which has often been found between ozone profiles from balloon soundings and from other techniques such as rocket observations or Umkehr measurements may be explained by this effect. An altitude correction would have important consequences as to the climatology of ozone in the middle stratosphere as adopted at the moment. About half of the day-to-day variability of ozone observed from soundings with VIZ radiosondes above the 30 km level, is induced by the variability of Zr-Zs. The agreement between altitudes calculated from radar data and Vaisala radiosondes is much better; from 34 comparative soundings a mean difference (plus or minus standard deviation) of about - 300 plus/minus 180 m was found at 30 km...|$|R
40|$|In {{the frame}} of this work, a new small-size balloon-borne sonde was developed. A {{miniature}} grating spectrometer in the sonde measures simultaneously the solar spectral irradiance at a wide wavelength range from 200 to 850. As a first application, ozone profiles have been determined by measuring {{the changes in the}} spectral irradiance, caused by ozone absorption in the Huggins band. The wide spectral coverage of the spectrometer offers the possibility for measurements of other trace gases which absorb within the wavelength range, e. g. NO 2 and BrO. The low weight of the new sonde (1. 7 kg), the moderate price, and the autonomous portable telemetry system makes it a very versatile tool for satellite validation and for case studies, which requires a high number of launches. The newly developed sonde works well without temperature stabilisation, even so the spectrometer experiences rather large temperature changes (15 - 20 K) during the ascent through the atmosphere. Laboratory measurements were performed in order to quantify the temperature induced wavelength shift, the absolute irradiance changes, and the dark current behaviour. Based on the laboratory characterisation, inflight corrections could be applied, which compensate the effects of temperature changes. The system was tested in twelve flights and continuously improved. A technical status could be achieved, which guarantees for reliable measurements. For the retrieval of ozone profiles of the irradiance measurements, the analysis algorithm of the ground-based Dobson spectrometer was adapted. The determined ozone profiles were compared to ozone profiles measured by <b>electrochemical</b> <b>sondes</b> and LIDAR. The comparsion shows good agreement within 10 % to 20 % for altitudes above 15 km. For low solar zenith angles, reliable agreement with comparison measurements even at lower altitudes (8 and 15 km) were achieved. A quality criterion was developed, which allows the evaluation of the calculated ozone profile, independent from the comparison to other measurements. Absorption structures due to NO 2 could be identified in the irradiance spectra measured at different altitudes (15 and 35 km). This demonstrated the feasibility of the new instrument to measure other trace gases beside ozone...|$|R
40|$|Abstract - Three year {{observations}} of vertical ozone distributions (1985 - 1987) are analyzed, {{which have been}} gained by means of <b>electrochemical</b> ozone <b>sondes</b> (OSE- 3) at GEORG FORSTER station (71 °S; 12 °E). This material and additional data of other stations are used to discuss the primary chemical origin of the spring time ozone depletion in connection with dynamically conditioned variations of ozone distribution in the southern polar stratosphere. A mean pattern featured by three typical time periods of the ozone depletion using the height-time variations of pronounced maxima of the vertical ozone distribution is drawn to localize the chemical active regionDuring spring in 1987 the ozone variations are discussed in more detail to separate different dynamical impacts like an irregular outflow of ozone into the troposphere and the control of vertical ozone distribution by dynamics of the southern polar stratospheric vortex itself. The special dynamical preconditions rendered it possible to use the height variations of stratospheric ozone as an indicator for the verticl diabatic circulation inside the polar stratospheric vortex...|$|R
40|$|The {{sulfur dioxide}} {{concentration}} in San Jose, Costa Rica was monitored {{to investigate the}} transportation of volcanic plumes from nearby active volcanoes – especially Mount Turrialba. The sulfur dioxide plumes were investigated using Dual <b>Electrochemical</b> Cell <b>sondes</b> and a Thermo Scientific detector Model 43 i-TLE (Trace Level Enhanced). The directional sources of sulfur dioxide were investigated by comparing the wind direction obtained from a weather center at San Pedro with the ground data from the 43 i detector. The wind direction comparison indicated that higher SO 2 concentrations (between 1 and 16 ppb) were most commonly measured with winds from the NE and SE. The higher SO 2 (2 ppb +) plumes were also investigated using HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model). These trajectories gave similar results, often indicating a plume intersection with Mount Turrialba to the NNE. The study will continue to track the SO 2 plumes for comparison with satellite data and intends to investigate the ozone diurnal cycle {{over the course of}} the next year...|$|R

We use these profiles and a radiative transfer model to calculate separate air mass factors (AMFs) for each twilight period. We examine ozone data {{from one of}} the spectrometers of the Système d'Analyse par Observation Zénithale (SAOZ) design and we show that these separate AMFs give very straight Langley plots, except at solar zenith angles exceeding 90 °. Total ozone calculated using these AMFs, by a variety of commonly used procedures, agrees with the total ozone calculated by vertically integrating the sonde profiles, with mean differences of 0 to 7 Dobson units (DU), depending on the method, and standard deviations of 9 to 11 DU (1 σ). Total ozone calculated using the best procedure (i. e., averaging twilight values), which is not sensitive to errors in the gradients of AMFs, gave excellent agreement whether using separate AMFs or fixed climatological AMFs. We analyse the variance of the data set and several sources of systematic error in the measurements.

40|$|A balloon {{flight to}} compare 18 ozonesondes with an ozone {{photometer}} and with ozone column measurements from Dobson and Brewer spectrophotometers {{was completed in}} April 2004. The core experiment consisted of 12 electrochemical concentration cell ozonesondes, 6 from Science Pump Corporation (SP) and 6 from ENSCI Corporation (ES), prepared with cathode solution concentrations of 0. 5 % KI (half buffer) and 1. 0 % KI (full buffer). Auxiliary ozonesondes consisted of two <b>electrochemical</b> concentration cell <b>sondes</b> with 2. 0 % KI (no buffer), two reconditioned sondes, and two Japanese-KC 96 sondes. Precision of each group of similarly prepared ozonesondes was < 2 - 3 %. The six ozonesondes prepared according to the manufacturer's recommendations (SP, 1. 0 % KI, ES 0. 5 % KI) overestimated the photometer measurements by 5 - 10 % in the stratosphere, but provided ozone columns in good agreement with the ground-based spectrophotometer measurements. This {{is consistent with the}} difference (similar to 5 %) in ozone photometer and column measurements observed during the experiment. Using cathode cell concentrations of 1. 0 % KI for ES sondes caused overestimates of the photometer by 10 - 15 % and of ozone column by 5 - 10 %. In contrast, 0. 5 % KI in SP sondes led to good agreement with the photometer, but underestimates of ozone column. The KC 96 sondes underestimated the photometer measurements by about 5 - 15 % at air pressures above 30 hPa. Agreement was within 5 % at lower pressures. Diluting the solution concentration and the buffers from 1. 0 % to 0. 5 % KI causes an approximately linear pressure-dependent decrease in ozone for both SP and ES sondes, ratio (0. 5 KI/ 1. 0 KI) = 0. 9 + 0. 024 * log(10) (Pressure) ...|$|R

Multi-annual averages of UT/LS ozone were built using the aircraft data sets (1975 - 1979 and 1994 - 2001), and long-term changes between the 1970 s and 1990 s were derived by comparison. The data were binned relative to the dynamical tropopause to separate between UT and LS air masses. LS data were analysed using equivalent latitudes. In the UT, pronounced increases of 20 - 40 % are found over the Middle East and South Asia {{in the spring and}} summer seasons.
