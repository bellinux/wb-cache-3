5|$|A purely non-socialist, conservative-led {{cabinet of}} Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was {{appointed}} on 27 November. The nomination {{was both a}} long-term aim of the conservatives and a respond to the labour movements' acts during November 1917. Svinhufvud's main goals were to separate Finland from Russia, strengthen the <b>military</b> <b>power</b> of the Civil-White Guards and to return at least {{a part of the}} Parliament's new power to the Senate.|$|E

5|$|The {{demands of}} the SA for more {{political}} and <b>military</b> <b>power</b> caused anxiety among military, industrial and political leaders. In response, Hitler purged the entire SA leadership in the Night of the Long Knives, which took place from 30 June to 2 July 1934.

5|$|By the 9th century, the Slavs {{had settled}} the Baltic coast in Pomerania, which {{subsequently}} {{developed into a}} commercial and <b>military</b> <b>power.</b> Along the coastline, remnants of Scandinavian settlements and emporia were to be found. The most important of them was probably the trade settlement and seaport of Truso, located in Prussia. Prussia itself was relatively unaffected by Slavic migration and remained inhabited by Baltic Old Prussians. During the same time, the tribe of the Vistulans (Wiślanie), based in Kraków and the surrounding region, controlled a large area in the south, which they developed and fortified with many strongholds.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not certain}} that the slaves were a {{homogeneous}} group {{under the leadership of}} Spartacus.

Certainly other slave leaders are mentioned—Crixus, Oenomaus, Gannicus, and Castus—and it cannot be told from the historical evidence whether they were aides, subordinates, or even equals leading groups of their own and traveling in convoy with Spartacus' people.|$|E

50|$|A demilitarized zone, DMZ or DZ {{is an area}} {{in which}} {{treaties}} or agreements between nations, <b>military</b> <b>powers</b> or contending groups forbid military installations, activities or personnel.

A DMZ may sometimes form a de facto international border, such as the 38th parallel between North and South Korea. Other examples of demilitarized zones are a 120 mi area between Iraq and Kuwait, Antarctica (preserved for scientific exploration and study) and outer space (space more than 100 mi from the earth's surface).|$|R

5|$|On 22 June 1941, Germany, {{supported}} by Italy and Romania, invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa, with Germany accusing the Soviets of plotting against them. They were joined shortly by Finland and Hungary. The primary targets of this surprise offensive were the Baltic region, Moscow and Ukraine, {{with the ultimate}} goal of ending the 1941 campaign near the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan line, from the Caspian to the White Seas. Hitler's objectives were to eliminate the Soviet Union as a <b>military</b> <b>power,</b> exterminate Communism, generate Lebensraum ("living space") by dispossessing the native population and guarantee access to the strategic resources needed to defeat Germany's remaining rivals.|$|E
5|$|Several {{paragraphs}} outline potential {{conditions for}} an armistice, rejecting any {{notion that the}} German Empire has any place in dictating the terms of peace. The authors also insist that the German populace must accept some blame for having not resisted the march to war {{on the part of}} the German government. The authors maintain that immediate calls for negotiation would not be favorable, as the German state would potentially dictate the process from a position of diplomatic and <b>military</b> <b>power.</b> Instead, the manifesto proclaims that the war must be continued so that the German state loses its military strength, and by extension, its ability to negotiate.|$|E
5|$|Sinification of the Yue and Dian tribes {{was brought}} about by a {{combination}} of Han imperial <b>military</b> <b>power,</b> regular Han Chinese settlement and an influx of Han Chinese refugees. The military invasions and an influx Han Chinese immigrants created a culture that merged Han Chinese traditions with indigenous elements. Archaeological digs in the area reveal the extent of Han Chinese influence. Han dynasty tombs in Guangzhou, Guangdong show that the native tools and ceramics were gradually replaced by those modeled after Chinese styles by the Western Han. Excavations from the period have uncovered bronze mirrors, stoves, wells, incense burners, tripods, and lanterns manufactured {{in the style of the}} Han.|$|E

5|$|The Finns faced a {{detrimental}} {{interaction of}} power struggle and breakdown of society during 1917. The collapse of Russia induced {{a chain reaction}} of disintegration, starting from the government, <b>military</b> <b>power</b> and economy, and spreading downwards to all fields of the society such as local administration and workplaces, and finally {{to the level of}} individual citizens as changes and questions of freedom, responsibility and morality. The Social Democrats wanted to retain the civil rights achieved and increase socialists' power over the society. The conservatives feared to lose the long-held socioeconomic might. Both factions, with groups aiming at major supremacy, collaborated with the corresponding political forces in Russia, deepening the split in the nation.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat at}} Bathys Ryax signalled {{the end of}} the Paulicians as a <b>military</b> <b>power</b> and a threat to Byzantium.
