It was also an elaborate indictment, with all kinds of unspecified penalties given to be expected. Furthermore it was useful, depending fully on tone of voice, in financial extortion and enticement into criminal acts, and it could also be the best means of defense." ...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} of an organization that has multiple computing platforms is accessing SAS data sets stored on other operating systems. For example, <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> most of your work on SAS for Windows, but have to process SAS data sets stored on a corporate Linux server. Or, perhaps you normally work with SAS on a UNIX server, but need to access SAS data sets stored on a Z/os mainframe server. In such cases, the old method of processing data stored on a different server {{was to create a}} SAS transport file on the remote SAS server, FTP it to your local server, then create a SAS data set from the transport file. This method resulted in a local copy of the SAS data set that was converted to the correct machine format of the local SAS server. SAS/Connect software eliminates this process and allows you to either submit SAS programs to execute on the remote server, or to process SAS data sets located on the remote server from your local SAS session. This paper discusses the major features of SAS/Connect software that facilitate the processing of SAS data sets located on foreign operating systems. It outlines three of the most salient features of SAS/Connect software: Compute Services, Data Transfer Services, and Remote Library Services. These features allow SAS data sets to be transferred to and from another operating system, and to be read from a SAS program running on another operating system, respectively. Then, this paper provides multiple examples of how you can use SAS/Connect to process remote SAS data sets locally, or submit your SAS programs to run on a remote computer. After reading this paper, you will have practical knowledge that allows you to process your SAS data sets anyway, anyhow, anywher...|$|E

The bill's passage marked the first time in more than ten years that a measure passed a Republican-controlled House when opposed by a majority of House Republicans. In response, former House Speaker Hastert criticized Boehner for not adhering to the [...] "majority of the majority" [...] governing principle by saying, [...] "Maybe <b>you</b> can <b>do</b> it once, <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> can <b>do</b> it twice, but when you start making deals when you have to get Democrats to pass the legislation, you are not in power anymore." ...|$|R

Greeted by a standing ovation, she said: I was {{once upon a time}} a respectable member of this community. Respectable didn't necessarily mean more than I took a daily bath when I was sober, didn't spit except when I meant to, and mispronounced a few words of fancy French. Then suddenly, even before Senator Joe McCarthy reached for that rusty, poisoned ax, I and many others were no longer acceptable to the owners of this industry....They confronted the wild charges of Joe McCarthy with a force and courage of a bowl of mashed potatoes. I have no regrets for that period. <b>Maybe</b> <b>you</b> never <b>do</b> when <b>you</b> survive, but I have a mischievous pleasure in being restored to respectability, understanding full well that the younger generation who asked me here tonight meant more by that invitation than my name or my history.|$|R

40|$|Mark shuffled behind Dr. Powell, furiously writing out the LaFarge {{equation}} for estimating {{oxygen consumption}} on his clipboard. As usual, he had embarrassed himself while presenting the previous patient after forgetting {{to do the}} basic cardiac calculations before rounds. He promised himself he wouldn’t forget it again. Mark’s pediatric cardiology clerkship, now only in its second week, had been the worst of his clinical years. Cardiology had never been his strong suit. During the first week, Mark’s struggle with interpreting blood gas results and repeated confusion of VSD with ASD had made it apparent {{that he was the}} weakest of the five clerkship students. Today, however, none of his peers were having luck with Dr. Powell’s relentless pimping. Dr. Powell was a decent teacher, though his reliance on that particular teaching tool made every morning miserable. “Mark, <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> can <b>do</b> better than your colleague. ” Mark snapped to attention.

5000|$|Hesse's work often shows minimal {{manipulation}} to {{a material}} while simultaneously completely transforming it.

Hesse's drawings have been noted as precursory drafts to later sculptures. Her work {{is often described as}} anti-form, a term that describes the resistance to uniformity. Her work embodies elements of minimalism in its simple shapes, delicate lines, and limited color palette. Barry Schwabsky described her work for the Camden Arts Centre in London, [...] "Things folded, things piled, things twisted, things wound and unwound; tangled things, blunt things to connect to; materials that have a congealed look, materials that seem lost or discarded or mistreated; shapes that look like they should have been made of flesh and shapes, that look like they might be made of flesh but should not have been - you can look at these things, these materials, these shapes, and feel the shudder of an unnamable nanosensation, or you can let your eye pass by them without reaction; <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> can <b>do</b> both at once." ...|$|R
