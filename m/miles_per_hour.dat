5|$|With the Hawaiian Islands behind it, John began a slow {{turn to the}} north, taking near-direct aim at Johnston Atoll, a {{small group}} of islands {{populated}} only by a United States military base. The storm slowly weakened from its peak as a Category 5 hurricane in the face of increasing shear, dropping down to a Category 1 hurricane with 90 <b>miles</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> (145 km/h) maximum winds. On August 25 local time, John made its closest approach to the Johnston Atoll only 15 miles (24 km) to the north. On Johnston Atoll, sustained winds were reported up to 60 <b>miles</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> (95 km/h), the equivalent of a strong tropical storm, and gusts up to 75 <b>miles</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> (120 km/h) were recorded.|$|E

This claim, of speeds of 600 to 800 <b>miles</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour,</b> was regularly repeated until it was shown to be physically impossible as well as incorrect by Irving Langmuir.

5|$|After reentering {{the central}} Pacific, John briefly reached a {{tertiary}} peak strength of 90 <b>miles</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> (145 km/h), a strong Category 1 hurricane, {{well to the}} north of Midway Island. However, the trough was rapidly pulling apart John's structure, and the cold waters of the northern central Pacific were not conducive to a tropical cyclone. On September 10, the 120th advisory was released on the system, finally declaring John to have become extratropical approximately 1000 miles (1600 km) south of Unalaska Island.|$|E

5|$|On April 21, 2015, Davis {{pitched a}} perfect eighth inning in {{the losing side}} of a blowout against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, {{retiring}} all 3 batters he faced, all on ground balls, using only 9 pitches. Davis in high school was 23–0 with a 1.85 ERA and was the Arizona High School Pitcher of the Year, and in college he had a 2.25 ERA as a pitcher. Against the Angels he threw his fastball as high as 88 <b>miles</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour,</b> threw a slider in the high 70s, and threw a cutter.

50|$|A chip log, {{also called}} common log, ship log, or just log, is a {{navigation}} tool mariners use {{to estimate the}} speed of a vessel through water. The word knot, to mean nautical <b>mile</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour,</b> derives from this measurement method.|$|R
50|$|The {{nautical}} <b>mile</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> {{is known}} as the knot.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave moved westward offshore {{the coast}} of Africa. The wave traveled across the Atlantic, and organized into a tropical depression off the northern coast of Haiti on September 13. The depression turned north and strengthened into a tropical storm and then a hurricane. Hurricane Debby moved north-northeast, brushing Bermuda with tropical storm-force winds. It continued strengthening as it moved north, peaking at 135 <b>miles</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> as a powerful category 4 hurricane. Hurricane Debby was the only known hurricane on record to reach category 4 north of 38°N latitude, at 38.8° North. Debby was also the second northernmost known Category 4 hurricane Atlantic hurricane, behind Hurricane Ella of 1978. Tropical storm-force winds were also recorded at Cape Race in Newfoundland when Debby passed on September 18. The storm accelerated and began weakening over the colder waters of the north Atlantic. Debby merged with a strong non-tropical system over the British Isles on September 20.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} the central Pacific, John left the area {{monitored by the}} NHC and was instead monitored by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC). As it moved slowly westward, Hurricane John continued to strengthen considerably in an increasingly favorable environment well south of the Hawaiian Islands; on 22 August John was designated a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale (the highest classification for hurricanes) and later that day (by Hawaii Standard Time) reached its peak winds of 175 <b>miles</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> (280 km/h). Also on August 22 (by Hawaii Standard Time), John made its closest approach to the Hawaiian Islands, 345 miles (500 km) to the south. John had threatened to turn north and affect the islands days before, but the ridge of high pressure that typically shields the islands from hurricanes kept John on its southerly path. Nonetheless, heavy rains and wind from the outer bands of John affected the islands.|$|E
5|$|Clearing Johnston Atoll, John {{turned to}} the {{northwest}} and began strengthening again as shear decreased. On August 27 local time, John reached a secondary peak strength of 135 <b>miles</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> (210 km/h), and shortly thereafter it crossed the International Date Line at approximately 22° N and came under the surveillance of the Guam branch of the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). By crossing into the western Pacific, John also became a typhoon and {{was referred to as}} Typhoon John during its time in the western Pacific. Immediately after crossing the Date Line, John again weakened and its forward motion stalled. By September 1, John had weakened to a tropical storm and was nearly motionless just west of the Date Line. There, John lingered for six days while performing a multi-day counterclockwise loop. On September 7, a trough moved into the area and quickly moved John to the northeast. John crossed the Date Line again on September 8 and reentered the central Pacific.|$|E
