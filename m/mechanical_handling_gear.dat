40|$|Bibliography: pages [167]- 176. In {{large scale}} brewing operations, process {{efficiency}} and beer quality rely on consistent fermentations. Improper handling of yeast {{may result in}} slow or incomplete fermentations and beer of unacceptable quality. The maintenance of yeast quality during yeast handling is therefore crucial. Current guidelines for yeast handling, plant design and equipment specifications are based predominantly on empirical knowledge. The effects of different equipment, flow conditions and physical conditions to which brewery yeast is exposed are largely unknown. Hence, South African Breweries (SAB) requested {{a study on the}} possible damage to yeast (loss of yeast quality) during <b>mechanical</b> <b>handling</b> in a brewery. The investigation detailed in this thesis was limited to <b>mechanical</b> <b>handling</b> of yeast during cropping (the transfer of yeast from a fermentation vessel to a storage vessel for re-use) and had the following objectives: to assess the potential for a loss of yeast quality during the <b>mechanical</b> <b>handling</b> in a brewery, to select and validate analytical techniques for the identification, characterisation and quantification of a loss of yeast quality, to characterise and quantify the loss of yeast quality during yeast cropping in a brewery...|$|R

40|$|Single fibre {{tensile testing}} of {{thermally}} conditioned water sized and γ – aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APS) sized boron-free E-glass {{has been carried}} out. The fibres were produced from identical melts following which bare fibre had only water applied to it before winding whereas the sized fibre had a solution containing only APS applied to its surface. Both fibre types experience a loss of room temperature tensile strength after exposure to elevated temperature. By application of a novel method of single fibre thermal conditioning it was demonstrated that the tensile strength of heat treated glass fibre can be significantly underestimated. Strength loss was found, in most cases, {{to be caused by}} a combination of thermal effect and <b>mechanical</b> <b>handling</b> damage. The latter is found to be influenced by thermal loading of the fibre. The onset of <b>mechanical</b> <b>handling</b> damage in APS sized fibre was found to be controlled by the thermal degradation of the silane sizing. This suggests that silane-based coatings, even when they are present as only a relatively thin surface layer, can protect fibres from the development or growth of critical surface flaws. The relative contribution to overall fibre strength loss from <b>mechanical</b> <b>handling</b> damage highlights the need to minimise processes which may cause fibre mechanical damage during glass fibre recycling procedures...|$|R
