The influences of <b>major</b> <b>nutrients</b> (nitrate, ammonium, and phosphate) on {{the accumulation of}} trace metals (Cd, Cr, Zn and Se) in Ulva fasciata were examined. The relative accumulation of metals was quantified by the kinetic measurements of accumulated metal concentration over a short exposure period (8 h). Our study demonstrated that macronutrients could markedly influence the rate of metal accumulation in the macroalgae. An increase in ambient nitrate concentration resulted in {{a significant increase in}} Cd accumulation rate, whereas the rate of accumulation of Cr and Zn was not greatly affected by the ambient nitrate level (between 10 and 100 muM) Zn uptake in nitrate-enriched macroalgae was, however, significantly higher than its uptake in N-starved macroalgae. The accumulation of Cd, Cr and Zn was not appreciably affected by the concentration of ammonium. Se accumulation was significantly inversely related to the ambient phosphate concentration, presumably due to the competitive inhibition by a high P concentration. Cr accumulation in the macroalgae increased significantly with increasing phosphate concentration. These data implied that the influences of <b>major</b> <b>nutrients</b> on cationic and anionic metal accumulation were highly metal-specific. The dependence of metal accumulation on <b>major</b> <b>nutrients</b> will appreciably affect our prediction of metal accumulation in macroalgae and the interpretation of biomonitoring data using the Ulm species.

Despite the growing evidence of associations between dietary patterns and obesity, {{we are aware}} of no study that examined the association between patterns of nutrient intake and obesity. To identify <b>major</b> <b>nutrient</b> patterns in Iranian adults and investigate their association with general and abdominal obesity. In this cross-sectional study that was conducted under the framework of the Study on the Epidemiology of Psychological Alimentary Health and Nutrition (SEPAHAN), dietary data were collected using a validated dish-based 106 -item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire in 8691 subjects aged 18 - 55  years. Complete data of 6724 and 5203 adults were available for general and abdominal obesity, respectively. Data on anthropometric measures were collected through a self-administered questionnaire. General obesity was defined as body mass index ≥  30  kg/m(2), and abdominal obesity as waist circumference >  102  cm for men and > 88  cm for women. Daily intakes of 38 nutrients and bioactive compounds were calculated for each participant. Factor analysis, followed by a varimax rotation, was applied to derive <b>major</b> <b>nutrient</b> patterns. Three <b>major</b> <b>nutrient</b> patterns were identified: (1) The first pattern was high in fatty acids (including saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids), cholesterol, vitamin B 12, vitamin E, zinc, choline, protein, pyridoxine, phosphorus and pantothenic acid; (2) the second pattern was high in thiamine, betaine, starch, folate, iron, selenium, niacin, calcium, and manganese; and (3) the third pattern was high in glucose, fructose, sucrose, vitamin C, potassium, total dietary fiber, copper and vitamin K. Men in the highest quintile of the second pattern {{were less likely to be}} generally obese in the fully adjusted model [odds ratio (OR) 0. 39, 95  % confidence interval (CI) 0. 20 - 0. 76].
