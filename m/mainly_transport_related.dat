40|$|Now-a-days mode of {{transportation}} playing {{a major role in}} <b>transport</b> <b>related</b> problems. Every day millions of vehicles are passing through roads, <b>mainly</b> in this <b>transport</b> <b>related</b> issues Time, safety and efficiency are the major factors why because mode {{of transportation}} {{plays an important role in}} urbanization.

40|$|Productivity is {{fundamental}} in addressing key economic indicators such employment, wealth creation, trade, competiveness and rural development in Africa. The inattentive {{attitude towards the}} importance of productivity in most African countries has culminated to problems that entail lack of sustainable productivity framework in their commodity development. In retrospect, as a panacea the value addition initiatives being {{set up in the}} continent should as a prerequisite take cognizance of productivity to its livestock agro-based production chain. This background, therefore, prompted the significance of this study to focus in identifying and examining the survey responses from the leather strata in Kenya related to productivity. In addition, the study evaluated the significance of the interrelationship between various stratums that interphase in the value creation process of the leather sector influence activities related to productivity. During the prognosis, a quantitative approach (n= 244), descriptive analysis including an aggregate score to ascertain the top activities impacting on productivity in Kenya was carried out. The results indicated that whilst producers were <b>mainly</b> concerned with <b>transport</b> <b>related</b> costs, skilled man power attributed a major constraint amongst th...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{efforts to}} {{evaluate}} the climate change impact of researchers have focused <b>mainly</b> on <b>transport</b> <b>related</b> impact of conference attendance, and infrastructure. Because these represent {{only a part of}} the activities involved in the science making process this short note presents the carbon footprint of a complete science making process of one specific case. Apart from presenting the total footprint, we evaluate the relative contribution of the different scientific activities, and quantify mitigating possibilities. The case PhD project had a carbon footprint of 21. 5 t CO 2 -eq (2. 69 t CO 2 -eq per peer-reviewed paper, 0. 3 t CO 2 -eq per citation and 5. 4 t CO 2 -eq per h-index unit at graduation) of which general mobility represents 75 %. Conference attendance was responsible for 35 % of the carbon footprint, whereas infrastructure related emissions showed to contribute 20 % of the total impact. Videoconferencing could have reduced the climate change impact on this case PhD with up to 44 %. Other emission reduction initiatives, such as using green electricity, reduction of energy consumption, and promoting commuting by bicycle, could have triggered a reduction of 14 % in this case study. This note fits in the movement of academics and universities willing to be green. The study confirms that researchers' mobility is the biggest contributor to his or her carbon footprint, but is not limited to conference attendance, showing the importance of considering all activities in the science making process.
