25|$|A {{group of}} neurons can also {{generate}} oscillatory activity. Through synaptic interactions the firing patterns of different neurons may become synchronized and the rhythmic changes in electric potential caused by their action potentials will add up (constructive interference). That is, synchronized firing patterns result in synchronized input into other cortical areas, which {{gives rise to}} large-amplitude oscillations of the local field potential. These large-scale oscillations can also be measured outside the scalp using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). The electric potentials generated by single neurons are far {{too small to be}} picked up outside the scalp, and EEG or MEG activity always reflects the summation of the synchronous activity of thousands or millions of neurons that have similar spatial orientation. Neurons in a neural ensemble rarely all fire at exactly the same moment, i.e. fully synchronized. Instead, the probability of firing is rhythmically modulated such that neurons are more likely to fire at the same time, which gives rise to oscillations in their <b>mean</b> <b>activity</b> (see figure at top of page). As such, the frequency of large-scale oscillations does not need to match the firing pattern of individual neurons. Isolated cortical neurons fire regularly under certain conditions, but in the intact brain cortical cells are bombarded by highly fluctuating synaptic inputs and typically fire seemingly at random. However, if the probability of a large group of neurons is rhythmically modulated at a common frequency, they will generate oscillations in the mean field (see also figure at top of page). Neural ensembles can generate oscillatory activity endogenously through local interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. In particular, inhibitory interneurons {{play an important role in}} producing neural ensemble synchrony by generating a narrow window for effective excitation and rhythmically modulating the firing rate of excitatory neurons.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—An {{important}} {{approach to}} reconstructing PET and SPECT (PET/SPECT) radiotracer images is to utilize high-reso-lution information from registered MRI or CT (MRI/CT) images. These methods depend on accurate registration of PET/SPECT and MRI/CT images. Herein, we consider registration via opti-mization of a PET/SPECT image-reconstruction objective func-tion {{which includes the}} registration parameters. Potential bene-fits of this approach include 1) modeling, within the registration process, of PET/SPECT noise and PET/SPECT acquisition effects such as limited spatial resolution, perhaps resulting in more accu-rate registration and 2) a natural framework for calculating joint uncertainties in registration parameters and radiotracer activity. In cases where the structures imaged by MRI/CT (e. g., gray matter and white matter in the brain) strongly influence the radiotracer distribution, the {{relatively small number of}} variables comprised of alignment parameters and regional radiotracer <b>mean</b> <b>activities</b> may account for, not all, but much of the estimable radiotracer dis-tribution, and it may be useful to develop methods for rapid, highly accurate estimation of these few parameters, ultimately embedding such estimation within more general estimation of the full radio-tracer distribution. Herein we develop Levenberg–Marquardt si-multaneous estimation of regional radiotracer <b>mean</b> <b>activities</b> and the six 3 D rigid body translation and rotation alignment parame-ters. The method is tested by a computer-simulation study. With a PET/SPECT scanner spatial resolution of 0. 2 cm FWHM, this study shows translational registration errors of about 0. 002 cm and rotational errors which are fractions of a degree. For small regions, estimates of regional <b>mean</b> <b>activities</b> are much closer to true values than are estimates obtained by OSEM using PET/SPECT projec-tion data only...|$|R

50|$|The Atlantic {{hurricane}} season officially began on June 15, 1957. It was a below-average {{season in which}} eight tropical cyclones formed, of which three became hurricanes. Of these hurricanes, two became major hurricanes. In an average season, ten tropical cyclones form, of which five become hurricanes. Five of the season's eight tropical cyclones developed in the Gulf of Mexico, the most since the 1936 season, in which six formed in the gulf. The first tropical storm of the season formed on June 8, {{a week before the}} official start of the {{hurricane season}}. However, the first named storm, Audrey, formed afterwards, on June 25; these two storms were the only to form in June during the season. July featured no Atlantic tropical cyclones. Tropical Storm Bertha was the only system to form during August, developing in the Gulf of Mexico. Despite warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the tropical Atlantic, no storms formed during the month, below the climatological average of one. The low monthly activity was in part due to an unfavorable wind pattern which prevailed across the Atlantic for much of the month. In September, however, conditions for tropical cyclogenesis were more favorable, with concomitant cyclonic activity. Four storms formed, of which two attained hurricane strength, higher than the <b>mean</b> <b>activity</b> of the last 70 Septembers. By contrast, only one tropical storm formed in October, below the average of two in the month. This tropical storm dissipated on October 27, 16 days before the official end of the hurricane season.|$|E
