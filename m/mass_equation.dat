40|$|In this paper, {{so-called}} alternative <b>mass</b> balance <b>equations</b> for {{atmospheric constituents}} published recently are assessed {{in comparison with}} the true local <b>mass</b> balance <b>equations</b> deduced from exact integral formulations. It is shown that these "alternative" expressions appreciably violate the physical law of the conservation of mass as expressed by the equation of continuity. It is also shown that terms of these "alternative" <b>mass</b> balance <b>equations</b> have different physical units, a clear indication that these "alternative" expressions are incorrect. Furthermore, it is argued {{that in the case of}} "alternative" <b>mass</b> balance <b>equations</b> a real basis for Monin-Obukhov similarity laws does not exist. These similarity laws are customarily used to determine the turbulent fluxes of momentum, sensible heat and matter in the so-called atmospheric surface layer over even terrain. Moreover, based on exact integral formulations a globally averaged <b>mass</b> balance <b>equation</b> for trace species is derived. It is applied to discuss the budget of carbon dioxide on the basis of the globally averaged natural and anthropogenic emissions and the globally averaged uptake caused by the terrestrial biosphere and the oceans.
