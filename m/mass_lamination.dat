40|$|Transmission {{of cancer}} by a tumor-bearing {{allograft}} is rare. Recently Barozzi et al. (Nat Med 2003) documented transmission of isolated tumor cells (Kaposi sarcoma) during the transplantation procedure. We {{report on a}} 40 -year-old caucasian female without a history of previous malignancy who received a first cadaveric renal allograft from a 63 -year-old male donor. The donor (former heavy smoker) died from a intracerebral hemorrhage. At the time of organ harvesting no evidence of malignancy was notable in the donor. 10 months post transplant the recipient experienced severe back pain due to an osteolytic lesion of the 10 th thoracic vertebrae. An intensive clinical workup disclosed five liver metastasis and osteolytic metastasis of the scull. CT scan and bronchoscopy of the recipient´s lung were negative. In addition repeated imaging of the allograft (ultrasonography and MRI) was completely negative. A biopsy {{of one of the}} liver lesions revealed a small cell carcinoma (synaptophysine, cytokeratine and neuron specific enolase positivity by immunohistochemistry) with no primary detectable in the recipient. DNA fingerprinting analysis of the malignant cells documented the Y-chromosome and a similar DNA pattern of both, the resected renal allograft and the biopsy specimen of the liver <b>mass.</b> <b>Lamination</b> of the resected renal allograft showed no macroscopic or microscopic evidence of malignancy. After a follow up of more than one year (after cessation of immunosuppression) the liver metastases completely vanished and the vertebral bone is remineralising. Circulating tumor cells were initially detectable in the recipient (preproGRP mRNA in recipient´s blood) but absent after cessation of immunosuppression. Rejection of the tumor (expressing HLA class I antigens) is a plausible explanation for this finding. In conclusion we report on the transmission of isolated malignant cells (small cell carcinoma), similar to the report of Barozzi, by the transplantation procedure. This finding is of particular relevance in the view of an ageing donor population...|$|E
5000|$|Shock and vibration: TMOS has {{important}} resistance to mechanical stresses during operation as the applied forces are distributed globally and not locally {{at the individual}} pixels. The low <b>mass</b> and the <b>lamination</b> structure of the active layer mitigate the resonances and modes.|$|R
40|$|The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) {{consists}} of two rings with cryogenic magnets at a 4. 5 K operating temperature. Control of positions of the dipole and quadrupole cold <b>masses</b> (iron <b>laminations)</b> and the beam position monitors (BPM's) during productionand installation is presented. The roll of the dipoles is controlled {{by a combination of}} rotating coil measurements with the surveying measurements. The center of the quadrupole magnetic field is obtained by direct measurement of the field shape within a colloidal cell placed inside the quadrupoles. Special attention is given to the triplet quadrupole alignment and determination of the field center position...|$|R
