500|$|Swift and {{her love}} {{interest}} continued their relationship, but then went {{their separate ways}} because {{it was hard for}} them to see each other. To Swift, the song resembles much optimism regarding love and how encountering the right person could surpass skepticism. She deemed [...] "Love Story" [...] one of her most romantic songs, although she was never in an official relationship with the subject of the song. In retrospect, Swift said the song is [...] "about a love that you've got to hide because for whatever reason it wouldn't go over well", adding [...] "I spun it in the direction of Romeo and Juliet. Our parents are fighting. I relate to it more as a love that you cannot really elaborate on — a love that maybe society wouldn't accept [...] <b>maybe</b> <b>your</b> friends wouldn't accept." ...|$|E
500|$|Although his {{official}} job title {{was as a}} composer, Mitsuda found himself working more as a sound engineer. Over the next two years, he created sound effects for , Final Fantasy V, The 7th Saga, Secret of Mana, and Romancing SaGa 2. In 1994, realizing {{that he would never}} get a chance to move up to a real composition duty without some drastic action and feeling concerned about his low pay, he gave Square's vice president, Hironobu Sakaguchi, an ultimatum: let him compose, or he would quit. Sakaguchi assigned the young musician to the team working on Chrono Trigger, telling him that [...] "after you finish it, <b>maybe</b> <b>your</b> salary will go up". Mitsuda was assigned as the sole composer for the game, in the end creating 54 tracks for the final release. Mitsuda drove himself to work hard on the score, frequently working until he passed out, and would awake with ideas for songs such as the ending theme for the game. He worked himself so hard that he developed stomach ulcers and had to be hospitalized, which led Uematsu to finish the remaining tracks for him.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, if {{you have}} a lost {{position}} and can manage to induce your opponent to play quickly, you maximize the chances of a swindle. As Benko explains, [...] "{{if you have}} a lost position, you may as well try speed chess—you can only lose a game once. <b>Maybe</b> <b>your</b> opponent will get rattled and blow his advantage." [...] GM Larry Christiansen successfully used this strategy in Burden–Christiansen, Las Vegas 1992 (diagram at left). Down a queen for a knight and pawn against an opponent rated about 2200 (master-level), he managed to outplay his opponent and win! National Master Todd Barwick explains, [...] "Christiansen hung his queen (!) in the early middle game and had a hopelessly lost position. He then moved quickly, hoping to get Jim [...] caught up in a faster paced game where the probability of Jim making a mistake was increased. The idea worked as the game actually speeded up to a blitz pace where Jim ended up blundering away a game he would have never lost had he taken his time." ...|$|E
5000|$|Leroy Douresseaux {{felt that}} the {{masculine}} character designs of <b>Maybe</b> I'm <b>Your</b> Steppin' Stone came right out of [...] "gay porn", contrasting them with Kano's [...] "unattractive, awkward looking women". He found the characters and story to be [...] "actually quite engaging", although he noted that these came second in the author's priorities to showing sex scenes. Danielle Van Gorder felt that <b>Maybe</b> I'm <b>Your</b> Steppin' Stone would appeal {{to a variety of}} BL readers, as she felt it was [...] "well written", with [...] "gorgeous art" [...] and had [...] "interesting characters", as well as being [...] "dead sexy", with sex scenes [...] "a little more hardcore" [...] than most yaoi manga released in English. Rachel Bentham, writing for Active Anime, described <b>Maybe</b> I'm <b>Your</b> Steppin' Stone as being [...] "one of the more raw and explicit yaoi out there", praising Kano's skill at drawing [...] "vulnerable expressions".|$|R
