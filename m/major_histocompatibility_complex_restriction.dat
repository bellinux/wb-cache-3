40|$|Two quite {{different}} types of cytotoxic effector cells are presently being widely studied: cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) ~ and natural killer (NK) cells.

40|$|T-cell {{receptor}} (TCR) revision is {{a process}} of tolerance induction by which peripheral T cells lose surface expression of an autoreactive TCR, reinduce expression of the recombinase machinery, rearrange genes encoding extrathymically generated TCRs for antigen, and express these new receptors on the cell surface. We discuss the evidence for this controversial tolerance mechanism below. Despite the apparent heresy of post-thymic gene rearrangement, we argue here that TCR revision follows the rules obeyed by maturing thymocytes undergoing gene recombination. Expression of the recombinase is carefully controlled both spatially and temporally, and may be initiated by loss of signals through surface TCRs. The resulting TCR repertoire is characterized by its diversity, self <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>complex</b> <b>restriction,</b> self tolerance, and ability to mount productive immune responses specific for foreign antigens.

In the 1970 's, shortly after the initial discoveries in the mouse, we demonstrated that the T cell-B cell interaction is <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>complex</b> (MHC) -dependent in the chicken and requires at least one haplotype identity between the collaborating cells. Later, by using MHC-congenic and MHC-recombinant lines, we demonstrated that the T-B cell interaction in antibody response is MHC-restricted, and more precisely, Class II MHC-antigen-restricted. Furthermore, we proved that T-B cell cooperation in splenic germinal center formation is likewise class II MHC antigen-restricted. Recently, we have focused our studies on MHC antigen identity requirements during antigen presentation by macrophages to T cells. In these studies, Class II antigens were found to serve as restriction elements in antigen recognition by T cells.

Innervation of the thymus and its immunological functions made this tissue a candidate for utilization of various NO systems. In the present study on adult rat thymus, multiple cellular sites expressing NADPHd activity, thereby implicated as sites of NOS activity, have been identified using morphological criteria alone: blood vessel endothelium, dendritic cells, deep cortical or medullary stromal cells, intrinsic neuron-like profiles, granulocytes (possibly neutrophils) and fat cells.

40|$|It {{is clear}} that the {{activation}} of T lymphocytes for helper (1 - 3), cytotoxic (4), delayed type hypersensitivity (5), and antigen-induced proliferative (6, 7) responses requires their interaction with a specialized antigen-presenting cell (APC) 1 that expresses I-region-associated (Ia) antigens. Cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage (8, 9), including the liver Kupffer eell (10) and the Langerhan's cell of the epidermis (11) as well as the recently described dendritic cell (12), have all been shown to be effective APC and in addition to serve as stimulator cells in mixed lymphocyte reactions (13). Antigen-specific T cells appear to recognize a complex of antigen and Ia molecules on the surface of such an APC, and such "joint recognition " is responsible for the phenomenon of <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>complex</b> (MHC) <b>restriction.</b> However, the biochemical nature of the antigen processing event and the sequence of the T celI-APC signals that result in a T cell response have remained difficult to dissect largely because of technical problems in obtaining sufficiently large numbers of highly purified APC. A tumor cell line that possesses APC ability would clearly be an extremely usefu...|$|R
40|$|Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium {{causes a}} typhoid-like disease in mice {{which has been}} studied {{extensively}} {{as a model for}} typhoid fever in humans. CD 8 T cells contribute to protection against S. enterica serovar Typhimurium in mice, but {{little is known about the}} specificity and <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>complex</b> (MHC) <b>restriction</b> of the response. We report here that CD 8 T-cell lines derived from S. enterica serovar Typhimurium-infected BALB/c mice lysed bone marrow macrophages infected with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium or pulsed with proteins from S. enterica serovar Typhimurium culture supernatants. Cytoxicity was beta- 2 -microglobulin dependent and largely TAP dependent, although not MHC class Ia restricted, as target cells of several different MHC haplotypes were lysed. The data suggested the participation of class Ib MHC molecules although no evidence for the presence of Qa 1 -restricted T cells could be found, unlike in previous reports. Instead, the T-cell lines lysed H 2 -M 3 -transfected fibroblasts infected with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium SL 3261 or treated with Salmonella culture supernatants. Thus, this report increases the number of MHC class Ib antigen-presenting molecules known for Salmonella antigens to three: Qa- 1, HLA-E, and now H 2 -M 3. It also expands the range of pathogens that induce H 2 -M 3 -restricted CD 8 T cells to include an example of gram-negative bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background: Natural killer (NK) {{cells are}} members of the innate immune system. Their unique properties, {{including}} recognition of viral infected and tumor cells without <b>major</b> <b>histocompatibility</b> <b>complex</b> (MHC) <b>restriction</b> or prior sensitization, make them a suitable choice for immunotherapy. Low numbers of NK cells in circulating blood is the most important obstacle for this goal. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} make an optimum in vitro condition to proliferate and differentiate cord blood (CB) -NK cell progenitors to mature NK cells, which can be used for cell therapy. Materials and Methods: In our study, CB-Mononuclear Cells’ (MNCs) CD 3 + lymphocytes were positive depleted using immunomagnetic microbeads. This CD 3 -depleted (CD 3 -dep) CB - MNCs compartment was used for in vitro expansion with or without a layer of amnion membrane mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in combination with cytokines that are essential for NK cells expansion (IL- 2, IL- 3, IL- 15, and FLT 3 ligand). The expansion period lasted for one week. On day seven, immunophenotype and fold expansion of differentiated cells were measured. Results: Combination of cytokines and MSC layer yielded significant fold expansion in comparison with cytokines without feeder conditions (day 7 : 5. 2 ± 1. 12 and 2 ± 0. 78, respectively, P < 0. 05). CD 3 -/CD 56 + cells percentage increased during the culture period in MSCs/with cytokine and cytokine/without feeder, respectively (day 0 : 4. 4 ± 0. 42...|$|R
