50|$|A {{constant}} speed drive (CSD) is a mechanical gearbox that takes {{an input shaft}} rotating at {{a wide range of}} speeds, delivering this power to an output shaft that rotates at a {{constant speed}}, despite the varying input. They are used to drive mechanisms, typically electrical generators, that require a constant input speed. Constant speed drives are usually found as part of the accessory drives of gas turbine engines, such as aircraft jet engines. Constant-speed drives are usually found supplying accessory equipment and are rarely needed for an engine's <b>main</b> <b>power</b> <b>output.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction: Functional {{electrical}} stimulation (FES) {{is a technique}} that has been successfully employed in rehabilitation treatment to mitigate problems after spinal cord injury (SCI). One of the most relevant modules in a typical FES system is the power or output amplifier stage, {{which is responsible for}} the application of voltage or current pulses of proper intensity to the biological tissue, applied noninvasively via electrodes, placed on the skin surface or inside the muscular tissue, closer to the nervous fibers. The goals of this paper are to describe and discuss about the <b>main</b> <b>power</b> <b>output</b> designs usually employed in transcutaneous functional electrical stimulators as well as safety precautions taken to protect patients. Methods A systematic review investigated the circuits of papers published in IEEE Xplore and ScienceDirect databases from 2000 to 2016. The query terms were “((FES or Functional electric stimulator) and (circuit or design)) ” with 274 papers retrieved from IEEE Xplore and 29 from ScienceDirect. After the application of exclusion criteria the amount of papers decreased to 9 and 2 from IEEE Xplore and ScienceDirect, respectively. One paper was inserted in the results as a technological contribution to the field. Therefore, 12 papers presented power stage circuits suitable to stimulate great muscles. Discussion The retrieved results presented relevant circuits with different electronic strategies and circuit components. Some of them considered patient safety strategies or aimed to preserve muscle homeostasis such as biphasic current application, which prevents charge accumulation in stimulated tissues as well as circuits that dealt with electrical impedance variation to keep the electrode-tissue interface within an electrochemical safe regime. The investigation revealed a predominance of design strategies using operational amplifiers in power circuits, current outputs, and safety methods to reduce risks of electrical hazards and discomfort to the individual submitted to FES application...|$|E

However, the load regulator is retained as a “back-up” in case of engine overload.

Silica sols were realized by tetraethylorthosilicate, triethoxymethylsilane, ethanol, water and nitric acid or ammonia. Solvent-free sols were also synthesised.

The voltage regulation circuit is used for generating auxiliary voltage to regulate amplitude of the sine alternating current voltage which is loaded on the illumination load. Power consumption of the voltage regulation circuit of illuminating lights is small, harmonic wave loaded on the illumination load is also small, so that the alternating current voltage loaded on the illumination load is still of sine curve. The normal voltage requirement loaded by the illumination system is satisfied, in particular when being inputted with sine curved voltage, twinkling of an HID lamp or a fluorescent lamp is reduced, the power factor is enhanced, and the service life of an illuminating lamp is extended. In addition, the method is also suitable for other illuminating lamps inputted with the sine curved voltage. 本发明提供一种照明灯光的电压调控电路，适用于由主电源和照明负载串接组成的照明系统中，该单相照明系统包括输出正弦交流电压的主电源和照明负载；照明灯光的电压调控电路串接在主电源和与照明负载形成的回路中，其包括调压电路和辅助电源，调压电路用以产生辅助电压，以调控加载于照明负载上的正弦交流电压的幅值。本发明的照明灯光的电压调控电路功耗较小，且在加载在照明负载的谐波也非常小，使加载在照明负载上的交流电压仍然是正弦曲线，满足照明系统负载的正常电压需求，尤其对于HID灯或荧光灯，输入正弦曲线电压减少了闪烁，提高了功率因数，延长了照明灯具的使用寿命。此外，该方法也适用于正弦曲线电压输入的其它照明灯具。Department of Electrical EngineeringInventor name used in this publication: 郑家伟, Zheng JiaweiInventor name used in this publication: 蔡伟锋, Cai WeifengInventor name used in this publication: 张自强, Zhang ZiqiangTitle in Traditional Chinese: 照明燈光的電壓調控電路Chin...|$|R

Additional positive {{features such as}} short delivery times, quick start-up, and retained high efficiency at part-loads have made gas engines the preferred choice for many small- to medium-scale power plants. Wärtsilä’s gas engine portfolio offers several well-proven engine models optimised for stationary power applications in the size range from 4 to 8. 7 MWe, and two dual-fuel gas-diesel engine modifications of 6 MWe and 16. 6 MWe.  There is a rising interest in combined cycle mode engines with possibly higher electrical efficiencies, at locations where heat energy is not needed or where electricity prices inspire investments in maximum power production. Various types of bottoming cycles can be applied to utilise the waste energy streams from the main engine and deliver additional <b>power</b> <b>output.</b> The basic hurdle though is the low electrical efficiency of the bottoming cycle due to low temperature levels of the engine waste energy streams, and the consequent low economic performance of the bottoming cycle hardware, which in itself can often require investment costs close to those for the main engine. Therefore, more efficient bottoming cycle alternatives should be examined, as well as a better optimisation and thermodynamic/economic evaluation of those should be performed in order to find an applicable solution.  The work presented herein concentrates on heat-balance simulations and thermodynamic evaluation of conventional cold-condensing steam bottoming cycles optimised for high electrical efficiency utilizing the waste energy streams from the W 20 V 34 SG gas engine of 8730 kWe net <b>power</b> <b>output.</b> Highest possible electrical efficiency for the combined cycle is sought, i. e. the bottoming cycle is configured and designed to match the given topping engine and to utilize the exergy content of the engine’s exhaust streams in the best possible way, while using only conventional steam technology with standard components, and applying a slightly optimistic approach with regards to isentropic efficiencies, generator efficiencies, steam condenser conditions, and heat-exchanger effectiveness. Steam bottoming cycles of varying complexity have been simulated and evaluated with the help of computer simulations based on the heat-balance software product ProSim.  The simulation results show that the net electrical <b>power</b> <b>output</b> of the steam bottoming cycle alone can reach from around 847 kWe (i. e. 9. 7 % of the <b>main</b> engine <b>power</b> <b>output)</b> for the simplest single-pressure cold-condensing configuration, up to 1270 kWe for a very complex yet practical configuration, which is 14. 5 % of the main engine output.

The results of this study indicate that the three methods of determining the VT were not different. MD values decreased with increasing ratings of perceived exertion. RPE differed between genders, with males having lower RPE's than females (p < 0. 05). Also, a significant gender x <b>power</b> <b>output</b> interaction was found (p < 0. 05). Finally, women experienced less skeletal MD than men during a progressively incremented cycle ergometer protocol...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to examine the role of central and peripheral fatigue on 4000 -m cycling time trial performance by comparing changes in <b>power</b> <b>output</b> and integrated electromyography (iEMG) in differently paced maximal efforts. Methods: Eight well-trained men performed three randomly ordered time trials with different pacing strategies, in which the first 2000 m were manipulated to evoke an increasing, even, and decreasing <b>power</b> <b>output</b> profile (SUB, EVEN, and SUPRA, respectively). Subjects were instructed to finish the last 2000 m of all trials in the shortest time possible. iEMG of the rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis (VL), and biceps femoris (BF) muscle, mechanical <b>power</b> <b>output,</b> and gas exchange variables were measured. Anaerobic and aerobic contributions to mechanical <b>power</b> <b>output</b> were calculated from gas exchange data. Results: The increase in mechanical <b>power</b> <b>output</b> during the SUB time trials was always associated with an increase in iEMG in all muscles. A decrease in mechanical <b>power</b> <b>output</b> {{near the end of the}} time trials was also marked by an increase in iEMG for all muscles, except for the RF. Comparing the last 2000 -m interval with the first, aerobic <b>power</b> <b>output</b> increased for all strategies. Anaerobic <b>power</b> <b>output</b> increased in SUB and decreased in EVEN and SUPRA. Conclusion: The relationship between iEMG and mechanical <b>power</b> <b>output</b> pattern was consistent with peripheral fatigue rather than central downregulation of mechanical <b>power</b> <b>output.</b> Specifically, anaerobic energy resources seem to be important in regulating pacing strategy.
