5|$|Because of its {{distinctive}} course, the Brabant Revolution had been extensively used in historical comparisons with the French Revolution. Some historians, following Henri Pirenne, {{have seen it}} as a key <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> formation of a Belgian nation-state, and an influence on the Belgian Revolution of 1830.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with the}} Kutrigur invasion, Justinian {{activated}} his alliance against the invaders, mobilizing the neighbouring Utigurs, {{who in turn}} asked for help from the allied Crimean Tetraxites. The latter invaded the Kutrigur homeland, {{taking advantage of the}} fact that many warriors were employed at that <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Balkans. Informed of the attack, the Kutrigurs were forced to leave the Balkans to defend their homeland on the north-western shore of the Black Sea.|$|E

5|$|Final Resolution {{is remembered}} for the TNA debut of Sting, which was ranked as the 2nd {{greatest}} <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> company's history due to it marking Sting's return to national television after five years. Bob Kapur {{of the professional}} wrestling section of the Canadian Online Explorer rated the show a 6.5 out of 10, lower than the ratings given to the 2005 and 2007 installments.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} a pivotal <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Southern campaign. The {{surprising}} {{victory of the}} American patriot militia over the Loyalists came after a string of rebel defeats {{at the hands of}} Lord Cornwallis, and greatly raised the Patriots' morale. With Ferguson dead and his Loyalist militia destroyed, Cornwallis was forced to abandon his plan to invade North Carolina and retreated into South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|The speech {{itself has}} since been praised for its use of {{political}} rhetoric, and is considered a landmark <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> independence of the Congo. It has also been cited as a contributory factor to the subsequent Congo Crisis and in Lumumba's murder in 1961. Since its deliverance, the speech has been widely reprinted and has been depicted in paintings and film.|$|E

Bob Kapur of the professional wrestling section of the Canadian Online Explorer rated the show a 7 out of 10, as he had for the 2004 installment.|$|E
5|$|A {{month after}} the Spanish Civil War began in 1936, several players from Barcelona enlisted {{in the ranks of}} those who fought against the {{military}} uprising, along with players from Athletic Bilbao. On 6 August, Falangist soldiers near Guadarrama murdered club president Josep Sunyol, a representative of the pro-independence political party. He was dubbed the martyr of barcelonisme, and his murder was a defining <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of FC Barcelona and Catalan identity. In the summer of 1937, the squad was on tour in Mexico and the United States, where it was received as an ambassador of the Second Spanish Republic. The tour led to the financial security of the club, but also resulted in half of the team seeking asylum in Mexico and France, making it harder for the remaining team to contest for trophies.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{rebellion}} did not itself achieve lasting success, {{it is commonly}} cited as a watershed moment in Nyasaland history. The rebellion had lasting effects on the British system of administration in Nyasaland and some reform was enacted in its aftermath. After World War II, the growing Malawian nationalist movement reignited interest in the Chilembwe revolt, and after the independence of Malawi in 1964 it became celebrated as a key <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nation's history. Chilembwe's memory, which remains prominent in the collective national consciousness, has often been invoked in symbolism and rhetoric by Malawian politicians. Today, the uprising is celebrated annually and Chilembwe himself is considered a national hero.|$|E

5|$|At {{the onset}} of the War of the Second Coalition in 1799, when the armies of the Danube and Helvetia were formed, he was {{assigned}} to the Army of the Danube under command of Jean Baptiste Jourdan. His 10th Regiment was part of Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr's III. Division, and held the far left flank at the Battle of Ostrach, 21 March 1799, in southwestern Germany. Although he was wounded on 14 August 1799 in Switzerland, he participated in the Second Battle of Zurich in which his 10th Chasseurs à Cheval routed a division of Russians, a decisive <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> French victory. Ordener was promoted to colonel of the regiment in 1801 and on 29 August 1803, he was promoted to general of brigade.|$|E
5|$|Bound for Glory {{is remembered}} for Nash being {{removed from the}} main event and for Rhino's impromptu {{championship}} victory. Rhino becoming champion was ranked by TNA as the 21st greatest <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> company's history. The event was dedicated to Reggie Lisowski, who died the night prior. Bob Kapur of the professional wrestling section of the Canadian Online Explorer rated the show a 9 out of 10, higher than the 2006 edition. It also received a higher rating by the Canadian Online Explorer than WWE's WrestleMania 21 PPV event held on April3, 2005, which {{had been given a}} 5 out of 10 by Dale Plummer and Nick Tylwalk.|$|E
5|$|François-René de Chateaubriand {{depicted}} the massacre in his 1827 epic Les Natchez, incorporating his earlier best-selling novellas Atala and René into a longer narrative that greatly embellished {{the history of}} the French and the Natchez in Louisiana. In Chateaubriand's work, the grand conspiracy behind the massacre implausibly included native tribes from all across North America. Chateaubriand saw the Natchez Massacre as the defining <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of the Louisiana colony, a position consistent with the views of other 18th-century historians, such as Le Page du Pratz and Dumont de Montigny.|$|E

5|$|Genesis {{is remembered}} for {{the debut of}} Christian Cage. It was also {{dedicated}} to World Wrestling Entertainment wrestler Eddie Guerrero, who died {{the day of the}} show.

Corey David Lacroix of the professional wrestling section of the Canadian Online Explorer rated the show an 8 out of 10, higher than the 2006 edition of 5 out of 10 by Bob Kapur.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{believe that}} the strike, and other strikes in Africa during the period, changed the urban and {{migration}} policies of the British government in Africa. Governor Hubert Young, after a long struggle, obtained research funding of labour migration in Africa. Historian Godfrey Wilson studied urban African labour from 1939 to 1940, but his work was halted. Although the strike achieved little at the time, it is seen a key <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> emergence of African nationalism in Zambia. African townsmen discovered their identity, leading to trade unionism and the gradual emergence of anti-colonial politics. The actions by British authorities led to five years of prosperity for the mining companies; European miners struck for higher pay and were rewarded. In 1940, there were several mine strikes in the province which lasted over a week; 17 workers were killed and 65 injured.|$|E
5|$|Just as {{her best}} music drew on {{sampling}} — assembling sonic licks and stylistic fragments borrowed from Motown, Stax, punk and early hip-hop – her personal style {{was also a}} knowing collage.

5|$|Modern historians {{describe}} the Royal Question {{as an important}} moment in Belgian recovery after World War II. The opposition between Leopoldists and anti-Leopoldists led to the re-establishment of Socialist and Catholic political parties from before the war. The Question was also an important <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Belgian linguistic conflict. It also {{put an end to}} the federalisation of Belgian institutions which might exacerbate the regional tensions exposed by the Royal Question. In addition, the perceived failure of the PSC–CVP to realise Flemish demands for the return of Leopold helped to strengthen support for the Flemish nationalist Volksunie party after 1954. In Wallonia, the legacy of trade union and socialist political mobilisation during the general strike paved the way for a left-wing revival of the Walloon Movement.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting the {{new school}} and ghettoblaster {{subculture}} in the U.S. during the mid-1980s, Radio belongs to a pivotal <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history and culture of hip hop.

Its success {{also served as a}} career breakthrough for LL Cool J and Rick Rubin.

5|$|The Battle of the Plains of Abraham, {{also known}} as the Battle of Quebec (Bataille des Plaines d'Abraham, or Première bataille de Québec in French), was a pivotal battle in the Seven Years' War (referred to as the French and Indian War in the United States). The battle, which began on 13 September 1759, was fought by the British Army and Navy against the French Army on a plateau just outside the walls of Quebec City, on land that was {{originally}} owned by a farmer named Abraham Martin, hence the name of the battle. The battle involved fewer than 10,000 troops between both sides, but proved to be a deciding <b>moment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conflict between France and Britain over the fate of New France, influencing the later creation of Canada.|$|E
