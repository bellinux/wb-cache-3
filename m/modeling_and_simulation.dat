40|$|The {{application}} of numerical <b>modelling</b> <b>and</b> <b>simulation</b> in manufacturing technologies is looking back {{for about a}} twenty-thirty years history. In recent years, the role of <b>modelling</b> <b>and</b> <b>simulation</b> in engineering <b>and</b> in manufacturing industry has been continuously increasing. This {{is well known that}} during manufacturing processes simultaneous effect of many different parameters can be observed. This is the reason that in former years, detailed analysis of manufacturing processes could have been done only by time-consuming and expensive trial and error methods. Due to the recent developments both in the methods of <b>modelling</b> <b>and</b> <b>simulation,</b> {{as well as in the}} computational facilities, <b>modelling</b> <b>and</b> <b>simulation</b> has become an everyday tool in engineering practice.

40|$|Abstract. The Canadian Department of National Defence (DND) {{has entered}} an {{unprecedented}} period of transformation {{in order to}} address the complex security challenges of the 21 st century. This transformation is not just about new equipment, but also about new concepts, new organizational structures, and new doctrine. The Defence Policy Statement directs that the Canadian Forces “…will rely on advanced simulation to develop new capabilities for the evolving operational environment. ” While the use of <b>modelling</b> <b>and</b> <b>simulation</b> within DND has been gradually increasing in recent years, the increased emphasis presents both opportunities and risks. For example, <b>modelling</b> <b>and</b> <b>simulation</b> can be used to offer insights into defence issues relatively quickly and inexpensively. However, if activities are not carefully managed and coordinated, scarce resources could be squandered through duplication of effort. Also, the capabilities <b>and</b> limitations of <b>modelling</b> <b>and</b> <b>simulation</b> may be misunderstood, leading to false conclusions. This paper describes the management of <b>modelling</b> <b>and</b> <b>simulation</b> within DND. Current <b>modelling</b> <b>and</b> <b>simulation</b> activities, plans <b>and</b> challenges are discussed. Examples are drawn from the areas of concept development, research and development, acquisition, verification, validation and accreditation, cost benefit analysis, <b>and</b> include <b>modelling</b> <b>and</b> <b>simulation</b> policy issues. 1...|$|R
40|$|At a rst glance, it is {{not easy}} to {{characterize}} <b>modelling</b> <b>and</b> <b>simulation.</b> Certainly, a variety of application domains such as uid dynamics, energy systems, and logistics management make use of it in one form or another. Depending on the context, <b>modelling</b> <b>and</b> <b>simulation</b> is often seen as a sub-set of Systems Theory, Control Theory, Numerical Analysis, Computer Science, Articial Intelligence, or Operations Research. Increasingly, <b>modelling</b> <b>and</b> <b>simulation</b> integrates all of the above disciplines. Recently, <b>modelling</b> <b>and</b> <b>simulation</b> has been slated to become the computing paradigm of the future. As a paradigm, it is a way of representing problems and thinking about them, as much as a solution method. The problems span the analysis and design of complex dynamical systems. In analysis, abstract models are built inductively from observations of a real system. In design, models deductively derived from a priori knowledge are used to build a system, satisfying certain design goals. Often, an iterative combination of analysis and design is needed to solve real problems. Though the focus of <b>modelling</b> <b>and</b> <b>simulation</b> is on the behaviour of dynamical (i. e., time-varying) systems, static systems (such as entity-relationship <b>models</b> <b>and</b> class diagrams, described in the Unied Modelling Language UML [RJB 99]) are a limit-case. Both physical (obeying conservation and constraint laws) and non-physical (informational, such as software) systems and their interactions are studied by means of <b>modelling</b> <b>and</b> <b>simulation.</b> 1 Basic concepts In the following, an introduction to the basic concepts of <b>modelling</b> <b>and</b> <b>simulation</b> is given...|$|R
