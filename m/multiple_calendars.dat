One example would be the absence of St. Lucia on December 13, although she enjoys particular popularity in Sweden. But Lutheran calendars also differ amongst one another in North America, with some individuals commemorated on <b>multiple</b> <b>calendars</b> but on different days (e.g., St. Bernard of Clairvaux on August 19 in the LCMS and August 20 in the ELCA) or individuals commemorated on one calendar and not the other (e.g., Martin Luther King, Jr. on January 15 for the ELCA and C. F. W. Walther on May 7 for the LCMS); with the 2006 publication of Evangelical Lutheran Worship (ELW) as a replacement to the Lutheran Book of Worship (LBW), some of these deficiencies in the ELCA calendar have been corrected. Within the ELCA, This Far by Faith and Libro de Liturgia y Cantico both prescribe calendars with additional commemorations specific to the ethnic communities they were intended to be used in (African Americans and Latinos respectively). The Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod has a different, somewhat minimized calendar when compared the LCMS and especially the ELCA.|$|E

Just to give one more example, Starner et al. [23] asked their study participants to specify their primary calendar system used away from desk. In a {{second part of the}} study, participants (most of them male university students) were invited to a face-to-face appointment scheduling conversation.

30|$|The current {{literature}} has addressed various {{elements of the}} project scheduling problem, such as tasks precedence, resource constraints, multi-modes, multi-skilled resources, multiple projects, <b>multiple</b> resource <b>calendars,</b> resource usage cost, and priority rules. Currently, no approach addresses {{all of the above}} in a systematic and integrated manner. The most widely used tools in the industry are Microsoft Project and Primavera Project Planner (P 3 and P 6 versions). These tools do not support multiple task modes (i.e., only one set of resources for each task), and they use a fixed set of rules for resource allocation, i.e., lack the dynamic resource allocation. They also do not guarantee accuracy in results when tasks require multiple resources with different calendars, resulting in faulty interpretation of finish time of tasks. These shortcomings highlight the need for one approach that can properly assist project managers in dealing with resource allocation.|$|R
30|$|Nippert-Eng [22] {{is one of}} the few {{researchers}} who tries to analyze possible reasons for a person’s use of one or of <b>multiple</b> <b>calendars.</b> She points out that, in our culture, people view themselves as having multifaceted identities which are related to specific places, times, and groups of people. Nippert-Eng [22] particularly considers ‘home’ and ‘work’ and the boundary work surrounding these realms of life. Boundary work is defined as “the process of creating and maintaining more or less distinct ‘territories of the self”’ and it is suggested that it can be described by an integration-segmentation continuum. For the extreme integrator, all space and time is multipurpose and there exists no distinction between what belongs to ‘home’ and ‘work’. In contrast, ‘home’ and ‘work’ are exclusive categories for the extreme segmentor. There is no conceptual, physical or temporal overlap between them. According to Nippert-Eng [22], integrators are supported by integrating strategies of calendar maintenance, for example by one portable calendar tool or by listing the same information on <b>multiple</b> <b>calendars.</b> Segmentors typically have realm-specific calendars both in location and content.|$|E

Part of the internationalization effort is the ability to engineer applications to use dates and times that conform to local calendars yet can inter-operate with dates and times in other calendars, for instance between the Gregorian and Islamic calendars. τ ZAMAN is a system that provides a natural language- and calendar-independent framework for integrating <b>multiple</b> <b>calendars.</b> τ ZAMAN performs “runtime-binding” of calendars and language support. A running τ ZAMAN system dynamically loads calendars and language support tables from XML-formatted files.

40|$|Granularity is an {{integral}} feature of temporal data. For instance, a person's age is commonly given to the granularity of years {{and the time of}} their next airline flight to the granularity of minutes. A granularity creates a discrete image, in terms of granules, of a (possibly continuous) time-line. We present a formal model for granularity in temporal operations that is integrated with temporal indeterminacy, or "don't know when" information. We also minimally extend the syntax and semantics of SQL- 92 to support mixed granularities. This support rests on two operations, scale and cast, that move times between granularities, e. g., from days to months. We demonstrate that our solution is practical by showing how granularities can be specified in a modular fashion, and by outlining a time- and space-efficient implementation. The implementation uses several optimization strategies to mitigate the expense of accommodating <b>multiple</b> granularities. [Keywords: <b>calendar,</b> granularity, indetermin [...] ...|$|R
30|$|According to Araúzo et al. (2010), {{classical}} methods {{based on}} mathematical programming can handle project scheduling when the problem complexity {{is low and}} the system stays somewhat static. These characteristics are seldom true in real-world projects. The most commonly used project management tools are Microsoft EPM (MP 2015) and Primavera Project Planner (P 3 and P 6 versions, Primavera 2015). These tools do not support multiple task modes (i.e., {{only one way to}} carry out a task) and do not guarantee accuracy in calculating task duration, when multiple resources and <b>multiple</b> <b>calendars</b> are required.

30|$|This {{research}} {{contributes to}} {{state of the}} art in the area of project scheduling. A simulation tool was presented to solve a problem which belongs to the class of Combinatorial Multi-mode Resource-Constrained Multi-project Scheduling Problems. There are very limited tools that have successfully addressed the resource allocation problem in a dynamic environment, involving multiple projects with multiple task modes and multiple priorities. The resources can have multiple skill levels along with <b>multiple</b> <b>calendars.</b> The resources can be renewable or non-renewable. The software tool provides several useful metrics (resource utilization, waiting time, and resources responsible of causing delays and increasing project cost) that can be used by the project manager to control overall project cost and schedule.|$|E
30|$|In practice, most {{projects}} {{result in}} cost overruns and schedule slippage due to poor resource management. This paper presents {{an approach that}} aims at reducing project duration and costs by empowering project managers to assess different scenarios. The proposed approach addresses combinatorial modes for tasks, multi-skilled resources, and <b>multiple</b> <b>calendars</b> for resources. A case study {{reported in the literature}} is presented to demonstrate the capabilities of this method. As for practical implications, this approach enhances the decision-making process which results in improved solutions in terms of total project duration and cost. From an academic viewpoint, this paper adds empirical evidence to enrich the existing literature, as it highlights relevant issues to model properly the complexity of real-life projects.|$|E
40|$|Resource {{calendars}} specify nonworking days {{of driving}} resources involved in construction projects. As {{part of the}} resource availability constraints in critical path method (CPM) scheduling, resource calendars may postpone activity start time, extend activity duration, and hence prolong the total project duration. Ultimately, resource calendars bring about changes to the critical path identification. Research has yet to address how to incorporate the effects of <b>multiple</b> resource <b>calendars</b> on the total float determination. In this research, the popular P 3 software {{is used as a}} tool for investigating the current practice of CPM scheduling under resource limit and calendar constraints. We assess P 3 's advanced resource scheduling functions (including resource leveling and resource calendars) and identify P 3 's potential errors in total float determination. Further, we propose a new method based on the forward pass analysis alone for accurately evaluating activity total float subject to resource calendar constraints. The application of the new method is illustrated with an activity-on-node case and a precedence-diagram-method case, with the results compared against those produced from P 3. Our research has elucidated on some critical issues of resource-constrained scheduling in the application domain of construction project management. The findings will provide useful input for the vendors and users of the CPM software-which is not limited to P 3 -to improve the scheduling methodology as well as the accuracy of the resulting project schedules.

40|$|Project {{managers}} today rely on scheduling tools {{based on}} the Critical Path Method (CPM) to determine the overall project duration and the activities’ float times. Such data provide important information about the degree of flexibility {{with respect to the}} project schedule as well as the critical and noncritical activities, which leads to greater efficiency in planning and control of projects. While CPM has been useful for scheduling construction projects, years of practice and research have highlighted a number of serious drawbacks that limit its use as a decision support tool. The traditional representation of CPM lacks the ability to clearly record and represent detailed as-built information such as slow/fast progress and complete representation of work interruptions caused by the various parties involved. In addition, CPM is based on two unrealistic assumptions: that the project deadline is not restricted and that resources are unlimited. With CPM, therefore, the most cost-effective corrective actions needed in order to recover delays and overruns cannot be determined. This research is {{based on the}} view that many of the drawbacks of CPM stem from the rough level of detail at which progress data is represented and analyzed, where activities’ durations are considered as continuous blocks of time. To overcome CPM drawbacks, this research presents a new Critical Path Segments (CPS) mechanism, with its mathematical formulation, that offers a finer level of granularity by decomposing the duration of each activity into separate time segments. The CPS mechanism addresses the problems with CPM in three innovative ways: (1) the duration of an activity is represented as a series of separate time segments; (2) the representation of the progress of an activity is enhanced; and (3) an optimization mechanism to incorporate project constraints into the CPS analysis. To demonstrate the ability of the CPS to provide better analysis than the traditional CPM, a number of case studies are used to show its ability to (1) simplify network relationships and accurately calculate floats and critical path(s); (2) achieve better resource allocation and facilitate accurate delay analysis; and (3) overcome problems {{associated with the use of}} <b>multiple</b> resource <b>calendars.</b> This research represents a change from well-known CPM techniques and has the potential to revolutionize and simplify the analysis of ongoing and as-built schedules. The developed CPS technique is expected to help project managers achieve a better level of control over projects and their corrective actions because it offers better visualization, optimization, and decision support for meeting project goals within the specified constraints...|$|R
