50|$|Mysterium is a {{cooperative}} board game designed by Oleksandr Nevskiy and Oleg Sidorenko. It blends aspects of murder mystery games and card-based guessing games. One person plays a murdered ghost who {{can communicate with}} the other players only {{through a series of}} visions in the form of illustrated cards. The other players, who take the role of psychic <b>mediums,</b> <b>must</b> interpret these cards to identify a suspect, location, and murder weapon.|$|R

25|$|The {{pressure}} transmitting {{medium is}} an important component in any high-pressure experiment. The medium fills the space within the sample 'chamber' and applies the pressure being transmitted to the medium onto to the sample. In a good high-pressure experiment, the medium should maintain a homogeneous distribution of pressure on the sample. In other words, the <b>medium</b> <b>must</b> stay hydrostatic to ensure uniform compressibility of the sample. Once a pressure transmitting medium has lost its hydrostaticity, a pressure gradient forms in the chamber that increases with increasing pressure. This gradient can greatly affect the sample, compromising results. The <b>medium</b> <b>must</b> also be inert, as to not interact with the sample, and stable under high pressures. For experiments with laser heating, the medium should have low thermal conductivity. If an optical technique is being employed, the medium should be optically transparent and for x-ray diffraction, the medium should be a poor x-ray scatterer – as to not contribute to the signal.|$|E
25|$|The <b>medium</b> <b>must</b> be enriched during {{in vitro}} {{selection}} to further favour hybridoma growth. This {{can be achieved}} by the use of a layer of feeder fibrocyte cells or supplement medium such as briclone. Culture-media conditioned by macrophages can be used. Production in cell culture is usually preferred as the ascites technique is painful to the animal. Where alternate techniques exist, ascites is considered unethical.|$|E
25|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} are fastidious organisms that cannot synthesize {{on their own}} all of their complex nutritional requirements. For LAB to grow and complete malolactic fermentation, {{the constitution of the}} wine <b>medium</b> <b>must</b> provide for their nutritional needs. Like wine yeast, LAB require a carbon source for energy metabolism (usually sugar and malic acid), nitrogen source (such as amino acids and purines) for protein synthesis, and various vitamins (such as niacin, riboflavin, and thiamine) and minerals to assist in the synthesis of enzymes and other cellular components.|$|E

25|$|Because {{at least}} half the {{population}} of atoms must be excited from the ground state to obtain a population inversion, the laser <b>medium</b> <b>must</b> be very strongly pumped. This makes three-level lasers rather inefficient, despite being the first type of laser to be discovered (based on a ruby laser medium, by Theodore Maiman in 1960). A three-level system could also have a radiative transition between level 3 and 2, and a non-radiative transition between 2 and 1. In this case, the pumping requirements are weaker. In practice, most lasers are four-level lasers, described below.|$|E
25|$|The second law of {{thermodynamics}} {{states that}} any closed-loop cycle can only convert {{a fraction of}} the heat produced during combustion into mechanical work. The rest of the heat, called waste heat, must be released into a cooler environment during the return portion of the cycle. The fraction of heat released into a cooler <b>medium</b> <b>must</b> be equal or larger than the ratio of absolute temperatures of the cooling system (environment) and the heat source (combustion furnace). Raising the furnace temperature improves the efficiency but complicates the design, primarily by the selection of alloys used for construction, making the furnace more expensive. The waste heat cannot be converted into mechanical energy without an even cooler cooling system. However, it may be used in cogeneration plants to heat buildings, produce hot water, or to heat materials on an industrial scale, such as in some oil refineries, plants, and chemical synthesis plants.|$|E
500|$|The trick {{has since}} been often {{repeated}} and explained. The <b>medium</b> <b>must</b> have the semblance of key-board, made of some light material, concealed in his coat sleeve or about his person. This he attaches {{to the bottom of}} the accordion which he holds in his hand. Then when unobserved, while the learned professor is [...] "taking down his notes" [...] for the public press, he reverses the accordion, and attaching the false keyboard on the bottom by means of a small hook attached to it, fastens it to the side of the basket; having now the real keyboard in his hand he is able to produce musical sounds. Afterward the accordion floated about in the basket under the table, without the contact of Mr. Home's hand. This subsequent phenomenon was given to avoid immediate examination of the first by keeping Professor Crookes in suspense, and giving the medium time to reverse the instrument and conceal in his clothing the false key-board which had been on the bottom of the instrument. The accordion was suspended by means of a small hook fastened to dark thread, which would be invisible in the gas-light.|$|E

2500|$|A {{modification}} of the Ritz–Tolman theory was introduced by J. G. Fox (1965).

60|$|The mercantile {{public are}} {{frequently}} led into this fallacy by the phrase “scarcity of money.” In {{the language of}} commerce, “money” has two meanings: currency, or the circulating medium; and capital seeking investment, especially investment on loan. In this last sense the word is used when the “money market” is spoken of, and when the “value of money” {{is said to be}} high or low, the rate of interest being meant. The consequence of this ambiguity is, that as soon as scarcity of money in the latter of these senses begins to be felt—as soon as there is difficulty of obtaining loans, and the rate of interest is high—it is concluded that this must arise from causes acting upon the quantity of money in the other and more popular sense; that the circulating <b>medium</b> <b>must</b> have diminished in quantity, or ought to be increased. I am aware that, independently of the double meaning of the term, there are in the facts themselves some peculiarities, giving an apparent support to this error; but the ambiguity of the language stands on the very threshold of the subject, and intercepts all attempts to throw light upon it.|$|E
