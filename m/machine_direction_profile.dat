High speeds are also needed in slitter-winders to manage the continuous production of paper from the machine despite the roll changes.

40|$|The heat {{transfer}} characteristics of turbulent impinging jets, typical of {{those used in}} paper <b>machine</b> cross <b>machine</b> <b>direction</b> caliper <b>profile</b> control were measured. The effect of jet entrainement on the impingement {{heat transfer}} by unconfined jets was successfully scaled using a jet thermal entrainement factor. The addition of a confinement plate to an existing unconfined impinging jet control system was shown to improve the average heat transfer by 33 % and 80 % for a nozzle-to-impingement surface spacing of 2 and 1 respectively. The thermal deformation of calender roll under control actuators was predicted numerically using finite volume and finite element techniques. The most desirable steady state control characteristics, i. e. high peak deformation and small width of deformation, were obtained on unheated rolls of minimum practical thickness. The results indicate that control actuator spacings less than 0. 2 m provide negligible control advantage. Experiments were performed on a double calender stack of a production newsprint machine to determine the optimal position for cross-machine direction calender control actuators which would minimize the response time and maximize {{the magnitude of the}} response. Control on the queen roll and the two rolls immediately above it produces the strongest response. The king roll and the top roll, each of which affects only one nip, are shown to be poor choices for the placement of control actuators. When two calenders are used in succession, the actuators should be placed in the first stack. Calender roll design must be considered when choosing the location for control actuators...|$|R

50|$|The rolls {{are usually}} placed with their roll {{directions}} oriented up-and-down slope, rather than along (or parallel to) them. There {{are two reasons}} for this: First, the <b>machine</b> <b>direction</b> has the greatest strength and flow rate; second, such orientation eliminates seams along the flow direction. If triplanar or boxlike channel geonets are being used for their high flow in the <b>machine</b> <b>direction,</b> the proper orientation is critical during placement. For very long slopes or along {{the base of a}} facility, flow must continue unimpeded from one geonet to the next. When geotextiles are liminated to the geonet, the geotextiles must be stripped back from the overlapped area such the upgradient geonet is directly on the downgradient geonet in shingled manner. There can be no geotextile sandwiched within this overlap area.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{experimental}} {{analysis was}} undertaken {{to establish the}} failure strengths in tension and compression along the strong <b>direction</b> (<b>machine</b> <b>direction)</b> and the weak transverse plane of isotropy (cross direction) for a typical paperboard. The principal strengths of the material along the strong <b>machine</b> <b>direction</b> and on the transverse plane which may be assumed to be approximately isotropic allowed the possibility of forming the elliptic paraboloid failure locus corresponding {{to this type of}} material. It was shown that papers in general are tension strong materials having the infinite part of their parabo-loid failure surface turned toward the tension-tension-tension octant in the principal stress space. Finally, attempts to use different strengths along the isotropic plane in order to represent the material as fully orthotropic indicated that there are only small changes in the failure locus due to the changes of the intermediate failure strengths. This implies that the simplified assumption that papers sheets may be considered as transversely isotropic materials is a satisfactory approximation...|$|R

For a given film thickness, molecular orientation on the film in the <b>machine</b> <b>direction</b> could be increased by increasing the size of the die gap. It was found that WVT of blended polyethylene films which involved some proportion of long chain side molecular branches components were more susceptible to die gap size effect than those films only involving linear type molecules. This was thought to be attributed to the more molecular orientation in the <b>machine</b> <b>direction.</b> The results showed that for a given degree of orientation in the transverse direction, WVT decreased if film thickness and die gap size increased.
