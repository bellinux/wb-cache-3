[...] After hitting the home run, Bonds gave Bacsik an autographed bat.|$|E
500|$|... "Stay Together for the Kids" [...] {{is written}} about divorce {{from the point}} of view of a {{helpless}} child. Its heavier sound was inspired by bands the group's members were listening to in the two weeks they wrote their fourth album, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, such as Fugazi and Refused. Primarily written by guitarist Tom DeLonge, the song is biographical in nature. He and bassist Mark Hoppus were growing up when their parents divorced. For Hoppus, he was eight years old when he was sent to live with his father. [...] "The thing you realize as you get older is that parents don’t know what the hell they’re doing and neither will you when you get to be a parent. You’ve just got to understand that people are human and they make mistakes," [...] he said. DeLonge remembered learning of his parents' divorce when he discovered scrape marks on the driveway of their home. [...] "Right then, I knew <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> <b>had</b> dragged out his furniture single-handedly," [...] he recalled. He spoke on the song's inspiration in 2001: ...|$|E

In October 2001, Rashad stated: [...] "It really boggles everyone [...] from Day One, every single video she ever shot there's always been myself or my mother or my father there. The circumstances surrounding this last video were really strange because my mother had eye surgery and couldn't fly. That really bothered her because she always traveled. <b>My</b> <b>dad</b> <b>had</b> {{to take care of my}} mom at that time. And I went to Australia to visit some friends. We really couldn't understand why we weren't there. You ask yourself maybe we could have stopped it. But you can't really answer the question. There's always gonna be that question of why." [...] Her friend Kidada Jones said in the last year of her life her parents had given her more freedom and she had talked about wanting a family. [...] "She wanted to have a family, and we talked about how we couldn't wait to kick back with our babies." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1995, ex-landlord Chase Mellon III accused Stone of trashing the Beverly Hills mansion Mellon rented {{to him in}} 1993. Mellon {{says that}} he found {{bathrooms}} smeared with gold paint, marble floors blackened, windows broken and a gaunt Stone emerging from a guest house to say, “You’re spying on me.” Sly Jr., then {{studying to be a}} recording engineer, told People, “Nobody purposely destroyed the house. I’d thrown parties. <b>My</b> <b>dad</b> <b>had</b> a few get-togethers. We weren’t aware of the damage.” The damage, however, was not just superficial. “Sly never grew out of drugs,” says ex-wife Silva. “He lost his backbone and destroyed his future.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Because {{music is}} {{considered}} to be a dishonourable profession for women in many Muslim communities Khan faced severe abuse and death threats for several years in Norway. Initially the harassment and condemnation were directed towards her parents: [...] "I remember <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> <b>having</b> to defend the fact that I was doing music, even as a child. I remember this at eight, nine years old where ... various people come to the house and say, 'We don't even let our sons do it, why would you let your daughter do this?'".|$|R
5000|$|My father. I snorted my father. He was cremated and I couldn't resist {{grinding}} {{him up with}} {{a little}} bit of blow. <b>My</b> <b>dad</b> wouldn't <b>have</b> cared, he didn't give a shit. It went down pretty well, and I'm still alive.|$|R
6000|$|... "No--pray do. I don't {{want to talk}} to {{you about}} any of my silly scrapes. What are my scrapes? Absolutely nothing. Mere childishness. The other night I flung a fellow out of a certain place where I was having a fairly good time. A tyrannical little beast of a quill-driver from the Treasury department. He was {{bullying}} the people of the house. I rebuked him. 'You are not behaving humanely to God's creatures that are a jolly sight more estimable than yourself,' I said. I can't bear to see any tyranny, Kirylo Sidorovitch. Upon my word I can't. He didn't take it in good part at all. 'Who's that impudent puppy?' he begins to shout. I was in excellent form as it happened, and he went through the closed window very suddenly. He flew quite a long way into the yard. I raged like--like a--minotaur. The women clung to me and screamed, the fiddlers got under the table.... Such fun! <b>My</b> <b>dad</b> <b>had</b> to put his hand pretty deep into his pocket, I can tell you." [...] He chuckled.|$|E

5000|$|Smith {{grew up in}} {{the rural}} Western Massachusetts town of Colrain, {{learning}} piano, guitar, bass and drums as a teenager. As Smith described it, [...] "My grandmother was a stride piano player, Jelly Roll Morton-style... She almost went professional, but because she was a woman in the '20s I don't think she felt she'd be able {{to go all the way}} with it.

He was intensely loyal to the company. He worked there for 30 years, says Capellas.|$|E
5000|$|Simon Spurr {{was born}} and raised in Kent, England, the son of two bankers. His father's style shaped his design {{perspectives}} at an early age as Spurr discussed in a 2011 interview: [...] "I still look up to him... he's also very influential in my aesthetics. <b>My</b> <b>dad</b> <b>had</b> a lot of suits working in a bank, late '60s, early '70s. They still had the slim lapel, the narrow shoulder. And I guess it was subconsciously ingrained in me. That's the decade I always go back to." ...|$|E
5000|$|Peled has {{described}} his 2012 book, The General’s Son: Journey of an Israeli in Palestine, as {{an account of}} how he, [...] "the son of an Israeli General and a staunch Zionist, {{came to realize that}} [...] "the story upon which I was raised ... was a lie."

5000|$|In {{preparation}} for Rio, Watson shared [...] "If I was {{to win a}} medal, it won’t just me who has won, it’s them as well. They have done so much for me.

[...] She also mentions that she likes to use a form event as race practice to get rid of nerves before her main event. Rio was the first time she had raced in a pool where each swimmer was the same classification as the majority of swim meets are in a multi-class format.|$|R
500|$|Steven Aoun of PopMatters {{applauded the}} way the episode [...] "focuses on two popular {{supporting}} characters, and foregrounds the relation between memory and identity." [...] Furthermore, the site noted that [...] "the sound that takes you by surprise may be your own crying." [...] Novelist Lev Grossman, {{in an interview with}} NPR, praised the backstory of the Ice King and the exploration of his condition, noting that his origin is [...] "psychologically plausible." [...] Grossman praised {{the way the}} series was able to tackle the issues of mental illness, saying: [...] "It's very affecting. <b>My</b> <b>dad</b> <b>has</b> been going through having Alzheimer's, and he's forgotten so much about who he used to be.

5000|$|... "It {{was when}} I made my debut for Sheffield Wednesday at Bolton. <b>My</b> <b>dad</b> <b>had</b> {{brought me back}} and I got a few phone calls asking how the game had gone, and someone {{told me that there}} was a banner at the Park End at Goodison saying {{something}} about me and the white Pele - it was a very proud moment for me!

5000|$|I {{never had}} much of a family experience. Most of my {{relatives}} have passed away, and I have no contact with the other ones I know of. My father didn’t help us out when I was growing up. We were so poor. And his family had money. Plenty of money. But he was the wandering addict fuck-up, so they distanced themselves from my family. My grandmother once told my mother, when <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> <b>had</b> disappeared and we were starving, “You guys aren’t my problem anymore.” And my sister and I were told that we had grown up to be huge disappointments to them ...|$|E

They were interracial - my mom was Jewish and my dad was black and Native American. So that was something controversial in itself. <b>My</b> <b>dad</b> <b>had</b> a daughter and my mom had two daughters, and all they were missing was a boy, so they went out and adopted one, and it was me." ...|$|E
5000|$|Born on October 22, 1989, Michigan native Lawrence took up an {{interest}} in art, and later received a scholarship from College for Creative Studies in Detroit, MI. During Lawrence's enrollment at CCS, he focused on his drawing experience, and also studied abroad in Ireland. The aftermath of his experience in Ireland is what eventually inspired him to experiment with black light art. “I developed a duality in my aesthetic when I returned from Ireland,” Lawrence explained. “After spending four months doing charcoals, I craved the reintroduction of color to my work. <b>My</b> <b>dad</b> <b>had</b> been screen printing ultra-violet tapestries for decades, but I had not previously embraced the media in my own work.” ...|$|E
