50|$|Talc {{is widely}} used in the {{ceramics}} industry in both bodies and glazes. In low-fire art-ware bodies, it imparts whiteness and increases thermal expansion to resist crazing. In stonewares, small percentages of talc are used to flux the body and therefore improve strength and vitrification. It {{is a source of}} MgO flux in high-temperature glazes (to control melting temperature). It is also employed as a <b>matting</b> <b>agent</b> in earthenware glazes and can be used to produce magnesia mattes at high temperatures.|$|E
50|$|Barium {{carbonate}} {{is widely}} used in the ceramics industry as an ingredient in glazes. It acts as a flux, a <b>matting</b> and crystallizing <b>agent</b> and combines with certain colouring oxides to produce unique colours not easily attainable by other means. Its use is somewhat controversial since some claim that it can leach from glazes into food and drink. To provide a safe means of use, BaO is often used in fritted form.|$|R

One of the causes of that fact is that lots of brands have become this aspect into their hallmark; a clear example is the red of Ferrari or the green of Jaguar. Thus, {{due to the fact that}} exists a continuous competence between companies to be the industry leader, paints suffer a fast and continuous evolution process to provide better protection and larger range of colours and effects. That is the reason why AkzoNobel, leading global company headquartered in Amsterdam, has decided to carry out a project to study the gloss stability of matte clearcoats due to their increasing demand. This is a hard task even for the most experienced technicians. That is because these clearcoats are characterized by having a hard gloss adjust due to their non-linear performance on the addition of <b>matting</b> <b>agents.</b> By this study, it is expected to achieve a better comprehension of how the gloss is affected by the coat thickness and by the time. In addition, it is also studied if these clearcoats show good painting reproducibility related to the liquid product stability. For this study, the performance of four currently used clearcoats will be observed and compared in order to determine which of them is the best. With that aim, the clearcoats are prepared using two formulations (A and B) and two different dispersion processes (Cowles and sand mill) and several pieces are painted. Through the obtained results, it is observed that the stability is improved by using the sand mill dispersion and that the most stable clearcoat is the one which uses the formulation B and the sand mill dispersion...|$|R
40|$|Matting of {{polymeric}} pigmented coatings {{not only}} decreases the gloss of surfaces but also affects their colour and rheological properties. For this reason, {{it is important}} to study the changes in colour and rheology of coatings caused by adding a <b>matting</b> <b>agent.</b> Blue, green and white alkyd lacquers and pure silica as matting have been investigated regarding this purpose. The obtained results showed that after a saturation point, the alterations in colour and rheology change their direction. The optical processes effecting these alterations are discussed...|$|E

Trowel by Claes Oldenburg was selected as a case study. Four paints were tested on application and manipulation of gloss and color, then artificially aged with an Atlas Ci 5000 Xenon Weather-Ometer. Good results were obtained with Sikkens Redox PUR Finish Gloss, an industrial paint, which was modified with Deuteron KM-F 6 (micronized polymethyl urea <b>matting</b> <b>agent),</b> and Sikkens Redox PUR Finish Mix colorant paste, applied with an airbrush. Additional testing in an outdoor environment is suggested to confirm the outcome...|$|E
40|$|Gloss is a {{critical}} issue in many applications in the coating industry. Gloss depends on optical and rheological properties of complex mixtures, and estimating gloss from basic properties is still a challenge. In order to predict the gloss of an industrial thickened-to-application formulation this work presents a gloss-rheology semi empirical-modeling approach based on a gloss excess function and previous work from other authors. A new matt (low gloss) hybrid waterborne polyurethane dispersion composed out of a self-matting agent (A) and a traditional silica-based <b>matting</b> <b>agent</b> (B) has been studied, and the resulting gloss of the mixture has been correlated to pure component gloss values and dynamic viscosity at medium shear rate. Several modeling options have been tested and their goodness of fit has been determined. The most promising options have been selected and validated towards untrained data sets.

40|$|In tile manufacturing, α-Al 2 O 3 is {{the main}} type of alumina used in ceramic body and glaze formulations. This raw {{material}} acts as an opacifier in porcelain tile bodies and as a <b>matting</b> <b>agent</b> in glazes. White fused alumina (WFA) is produced by fusing calcined alumina in an electric arc furnace under carefully controlled conditions. It is usually employed in floor tile glazes {{in order to increase}} their abrasion resistance. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish a better understanding of how alumina and white fused alumina addition affects the thermal behavior and aesthetic properties of wall and floor tile transparent glazes. It was shown that both alumina and fused alumina increased the softening temperatures of the standard glaze composition. Corund was the main detected phase in tile glazes incorporated with fused alumina. This result suggested that white fused alumina did not react with glassy phase to form any other crystalline phases. This result can be attributed to higher refractoriness of white fused alumina. Presence of anorthite and gahnite phases was, on the other hand, observed in the glazes with alumina addition. It was further shown that alumina was more effective in increasing opacity and reducing glossiness compared to white fused alumina...|$|E
