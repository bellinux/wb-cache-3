2500|$|The <b>menstruum,</b> or flow, {{consists}} {{of a combination of}} fresh and clotted blood with endometrial tissue. The initial flow of menarche is usually brighter than mature menstrual flow. It is often scanty in amount and may be very brief, even a single instance of [...] "spotting." [...] Like other menses, menarche may be accompanied by abdominal cramping.|$|E
2500|$|Immacolata: A cold, {{ruthless}} sorceress, who was exiled by her {{own race}} for practising evil magic and desiring too much power. Already exceptionally gifted {{by the standards of}} the Seerkind, Immacolata is also a possessor/avatar of The <b>Menstruum</b> - a subtle, powerful and seemingly sentient form of rapture that manifests only in women and differently with each individual - where Suzanna's is described as a heavenly silver light Immacolata's takes the form of her own weaponised blood. Introduced as the main villain of the first half of the book she has many aspects associated with the wicked witch trope such as avoiding sunlight and a predilection for surrounding herself with bones/body parts. Unlike her ally Shadwell, Immacolata acts out of revenge with no desire for personal gain. In achieving her goal she unwittingly brings about her own undoing when Shadwell betrays, humiliates and kills her.|$|E
60|$|Therefore in the Eleventh place, it is observable, that, as {{in other}} solutions, if a copious and quick supply of fresh <b>menstruum,</b> though but weak, be poured on, or applied to the dissoluble body, it quickly consumes it: So this <b>menstruum</b> of the Air, if by Bellows, or any other such contrivance, it be copiously apply'd to the shining body, is found to {{dissolve}} it as soon, and as violently as the more strong <b>menstruum</b> of melted Nitre.|$|E
60|$|Secondly, {{that this}} action it {{performs}} not, till the body be first sufficiently heated, as we find requisite {{also to the}} dissolution of many other bodies by several other <b>menstruums.</b>|$|R
60|$|Fourthly, to {{make several}} trials on divers other bodies, as Metals, Minerals, and Stones, by {{dissolving}} them in several <b>Menstruums,</b> and crystalizing them, {{to see what}} Figures would arise from those several Compositums.|$|R
60|$|Thirdly, {{that this}} action of dissolution, {{produces}} or generates {{a very great}} heat, and that which we call Fire; and this is common also to many dissolutions of other bodies, made by <b>menstruums,</b> of which I could give multitudes of Instances.|$|R
60|$|First, {{that the}} Air {{in which we}} live, move, and breath, and which {{encompasses}} very many, and cherishes most bodies it encompasses, that this Air is the <b>menstruum,</b> or universal dissolvent of all Sulphureous bodies.|$|E
60|$|Such was the worthy divine whom our bon vivant at the Cleikum Inn {{hoped to}} conciliate {{by a good}} dinner and Cockburn's particular; an {{excellent}} <b>menstruum</b> in most cases, but {{not likely to be}} very efficacious on the present occasion.|$|E
60|$|Keeping this doughty resolution, he {{sat down}} to dinner with his counsel learned in the law; and speedily they {{dispatched}} the dish of chops which was set before them, and {{the better part of}} the bottle of old port, which served for its <b>menstruum.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{bacterium}} {{that grows}} in oil was tested for survival at elevated temperatures in <b>menstruums</b> of varying water content. For each {{doubling of the}} water concentration, the surviving fraction decreased {{by a factor of}} approximately 3. 0. A minimum value of 0. 02 % water is required before enhanced killing occurs...|$|R
60|$|And next, the Solution of all Metals into <b>menstruums</b> {{are much}} {{the same with the}} Vitriols, or Crystals. It seems {{therefore}} very probable, that those colours which are made by the precipitation of those particles out of the <b>menstruums</b> by transparent precipitating liquors should be transparent also. Thus Gold precipitates with oyl of Tartar, or spirit of Urine into a brown Yellow, Copper with spirit of Urine into a Mucous blue, which retains its transparency. A solution of sublimate (as the same Illustrious Authour I lately mention'd shews in his 40. Experiment) precipitates with oyl of Tartar per deliquium, into an Orange colour'd precipitate; nor is it less probable, that the calcination of those Vitriols by the fire, should have their particles transparent: Thus Saccarum Saturni, or the Vitriol of Lead by calcination becomes a deep Orange-colour'd minium, which is a kind of precipitation by some Salt which proceeds from the fire; common Vitriol calcin'd, yields a deep Brown Red, etc.|$|R
60|$|As for the {{mutation}} of Colours by Saline <b>menstruums,</b> {{they have}} already been so fully and excellently handled by the lately mention'd Incomparable Authour, that I can add nothing, but that of a multitude of trials that I made, I have found them exactly to agree with his Rules and Theories; and though there may be infinite instances, yet may they be reduc'd under a few Heads, and compris'd within a very few Rules. And generally I find, that Saline <b>menstruums</b> are most operative upon those colours that are Purple, or have some degree of Purple in them, and upon the other colours much less. The spurious pulses that compose which, being (as I formerly noted) so very neer the middle between the true ones, that a small variation throws them both to one side, or both to the other, and so consequently must make a vast mutation in the formerly appearing Colour.|$|R
60|$|How great an {{advantage}} {{it would be}} to such as are troubled with the Stone, to find some <b>menstruum</b> might dissolve them without hurting the Bladder, is easily imagin'd, since some injections made of such bodies might likewise dissolve the stone, which seems much of the same nature.|$|E
60|$|Tenthly, {{therefore}} the dissolving {{parts of the}} Air are but few, that is, it seems {{of the nature of}} those Saline menstruums, or spirits, that have very much flegme mixt with the spirits, and therefore a small parcel of it is quickly glutted, and will dissolve no more; and therefore unless some fresh part of this <b>menstruum</b> be apply'd to the body to be dissolv'd, the action ceases, and the body leaves to be dissolv'd and to shine, which is the Indication of it, though plac'd or kept in the greatest heat; whereas Salt-peter is a <b>menstruum,</b> when melted and red-hot, that abounds more with those Dissolvent particles, and therefore as a small quantity of it will dissolve a great sulphureous body, so will the dissolution be very quick and violent.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Tis not {{unlikely}} also, {{but that}} Chymists, if they followed this method, might find out their so much sought for Alkahest. What an universal <b>Menstruum,</b> which dissolves {{all sorts of}} Sulphureous Bodies, I have discover'd (which hat not been before taken notice of as such) I have shewn in the sixteenth Observation.|$|E
60|$|Now, as for {{all kinds}} of colours that are {{dissolvable}} in Water, or other liquors, there is nothing so manifest, as that all those ting'd liquors are transparent; {{and many of them are}} capable of being diluted and compounded or mixt with other colours, and divers of them are capable of being very much chang'd and heightned, and fixt with several kinds of Saline <b>menstruums.</b> Others of them upon compounding, destroy or vitiate each others colours, and precipitate, or otherwise very much alter each others tincture. In the true ordering and diluting, and deepning, and mixing, and fixing of each of which, consists one of the greatest mysteries of the Dyers; of which particulars, because our Microscope affords us very little information, I shall add nothing more at present; but onely that with a very few tinctures order'd and mixt after certain ways, too long to be here set down, I have been able to make an appearance of all the various colours imaginable, without at all using the help of Salts, or Saline <b>menstruums</b> to vary them.|$|R
60|$|Putting these {{into several}} liquors, I found oyl of Vitriol, Spirit of Urine, {{and several other}} Saline <b>menstruums</b> to {{dissolve}} them; and {{the first of these}} {{in less than a minute}} without Ebullition, Water, and several other liquors, had no sudden operation upon them. This I mention, because those liquors that dissolve them, first make them very white, not vitiating, but rather rectifying their Figure, and thereby make them afford a very pretty object for the Microscope.|$|R
60|$|A Seventh Query was, Whether the {{dissolution}} or mixing of several bodies, whether fluid or solid, with saline or other Liquors, might not partly {{be attributed to}} this Principle of the congruity of those bodies and their dissolvents? As of Salt in Water, Metals in several <b>Menstruums,</b> Unctuous Gums in Oyls, the mixing of Wine and Water, &c. And whether precipitation be not partly made from the same Principle of Incongruity? I say partly, because there are in some Dissolutions, some other Causes concurrent.|$|R
60|$|Therefore twelfthly, {{it seems}} {{reasonable}} to think {{that there is no such}} thing as an Element of Fire that should attract or draw up the flame, or towards which the flame should endeavour to ascend out of a desire or appetite of uniting with that as its Homogeneal primitive and generating Element; but that that shining transient body which we call Flame, is nothing else but a mixture of Air, and volatil sulphureous parts of dissoluble or combustible bodies, which are acting upon each other whilst they ascend, that is, flame seems to be a mixture of Air, and the combustible volatil parts of any body, which parts the encompassing Air does dissolve or work upon, which action, as it does intend the heat of the aerial parts of the dissolvent, so does it thereby further rarifie those parts that are acting, or that are very neer them, whereby they growing much lighter then the heavie parts of that <b>menstruum</b> that are more remote, are thereby protruded and driven upward; and this may be easily observ'd also in dissolution made by any other <b>menstruum,</b> especially such as either create heat or bubbles. Now, this action of the <b>menstruum,</b> or Air, on the dissoluble parts, is made with such violence, or is such, that it imparts such a motion or pulse to the diaphanous parts of the Air, as I have elsewhere shewn is requisite to produce light.|$|E
6000|$|Mason mused a moment. [...] "The cow was {{maternity}} {{pleading for}} its suckling; the robin's laugh suggested a thousand springtimes, and the cricket prophesied {{the coming of}} frost and age. Love and loss are in the wail of yonder song, the loneliness of age in yonder piping bird, and the infinite and all-absorbing <b>menstruum</b> {{of death in the}} growing dusk." ...|$|E
60|$|Sixthly, {{that in this}} {{dissolution}} of bodies by the Air, a certain part is united and mixt, or dissolv'd and turn'd into the Air, and made to fly {{up and down with}} it {{in the same manner as}} a metalline or other body dissolved into any menstruums, does follow the motions and progresses of that <b>menstruum</b> till it be precipitated.|$|E
60|$|For the opakest Bodies, {{if their}} parts be subtilly divided, (as Metals, by being {{dissolved}} in acid <b>Menstruums,</b> &c.) become perfectly transparent. And {{you may also}} remember, that in the eighth Observation there was no sensible reflexion at the Superficies of the Object-glasses, where they were very near one another, though they did not absolutely touch. And in the 17th Observation the Reflexion of the Water-bubble where it became thinnest was almost insensible, so as to cause very black Spots {{to appear on the}} top of the Bubble, by the want of reflected Light.|$|R
60|$|Thirdly, That all Metals (excepting Gold and Silver, {{which do}} not so much with the bare fire, unless {{assisted}} by other saline Bodies) do more or less vitrifie by the strength of fire, that is, are corroded by a saline Substance, which I elsewhere shew to be the true cause of fire; and are thereby, as by several other <b>Menstruums</b> converted into Scoria; And this is called, calcining of them, by Chimists. Thus Iron and Copper by heating and quenching do turn all of them by degrees into Scoria, which are evidently vitrified Substances, and unite with Glass, and are easily fusible; and when cold, very hard, and very brittle.|$|R
60|$|When Mercury {{sublimate}} is re-sublimed {{with fresh}} Mercury, and becomes Mercurius Dulcis, {{which is a}} white tasteless Earth scarce dissolvable in Water, and Mercurius Dulcis re-sublimed with Spirit of Salt returns into Mercury sublimate; and when Metals corroded with a little acid turn into rust, which is an Earth tasteless and indissolvable in Water, and this Earth imbibed with more acid becomes a metallick Salt; and when some Stones, as Spar of Lead, dissolved in proper <b>Menstruums</b> become Salts; do not these things shew that Salts are dry Earth and watry Acid united by Attraction, and that the Earth will not become a Salt without so much acid as makes it dissolvable in Water? Do not the sharp and pungent Tastes of Acids arise from the strong Attraction whereby the acid Particles rush upon and agitate the Particles of the Tongue? And when Metals are dissolved in acid <b>Menstruums,</b> and the Acids {{in conjunction with the}} Metal act after a different manner, so that the Compound has a different Taste much milder than before, and sometimes a sweet one; is it not because the Acids adhere to the metallick Particles, and thereby lose much of their Activity? And if the Acid be in too small a Proportion to make the Compound dissolvable in Water, will it not by adhering strongly to the Metal become unactive and lose its Taste, and the Compound be a tasteless Earth? For such things as are not dissolvable by the Moisture of the Tongue, act not upon the Taste.|$|R
60|$|And this {{is obvious}} in the filings of Steel or Iron cast through the flame of a Candle; for even by that sudden transitus of the small chips of Iron, they are heat red hot, and that {{combustible}} sulphureous Body is presently prey'd upon and devoured by the aereal incompassing <b>Menstruum,</b> whose office in this Particular I have shewn in the Explication of Charcole.|$|E
60|$|Fifthly, in its dissolubleness; {{for putting}} some drops of distill'd Vinegar upon the Stone, I found it {{presently}} to yield very many Bubbles, just like those {{which may be}} observ'd in spirit of Vinegar when it corrodes corals, though perhaps many of those small Bubbles might proceed from some small parcels of Air which were driven out of the pores of this petrify'd substance by the insinuating liquid <b>menstruum.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Blumenbach's book {{contains}} {{references to}} all the best writers on each subject. My friend, T. Poole, begs me to ask what, in your opinion, are the parts or properties in the oak which tan skins? and is cold water a complete <b>menstruum</b> for these parts or properties? I understand from Poole that nothing is so little understood as the chemical theory of tan, though nothing is of more importance {{in the circle of}} manufactures; in other words, does oak bark give out to cold water all those of its parts which tan? ...|$|E
60|$|That {{this is so}} {{has been}} {{observed}} by others, and will easily be granted by them that have been conversant with Microscopes. And it may be also tried by applying any substance to a hole through which some Light is immitted into a dark Room. For how opake soever that Substance may seem in the open Air, it will by that means appear very manifestly transparent, if it be of a sufficient thinness. Only white metalline Bodies must be excepted, which by reason of their excessive density seem to reflect almost all the Light incident on their first Superficies; unless by solution in <b>Menstruums</b> they be reduced into very small Particles, and then they become transparent.|$|R
60|$|Next, how the {{corruption}} of each of those exceedingly differing bodies should all conspire {{to the production of}} the same Plant, that is, that Stones, Bricks, Wood, or vegetable substances, and Bones, Leather, Horns, or animate substances, unless we may with some plausibleness say, that Air and Water are the coadjutors, or <b>menstruums,</b> all kinds of putrifactions, and that thereby the bodies (though whil'st they retain'd their substantial forms, were of exceeding differing natures, yet) since they are dissolv'd and mixt into another, they may be very Homogeneous, they being almost resolv'd again into Air, Water, and Earth; retaining, perhaps, one part of their vegetative faculty yet entire, which meeting with congruous assistants, such as the heat of the Air, and the fluidity of the Water, and such like coadjutors and conveniences, acquires a certain vegetation for a time, wholly differing perhaps from that kind of vegetation it had before.|$|R
60|$|Whiteness, if {{most intense}} and luminous, {{is that of}} the first Order, if less strong and luminous, a Mixture of the Colours of several Orders. Of this last kind is the Whiteness of Froth, Paper, Linnen, and most white Substances; of the former I reckon that of white Metals to be. For whilst the densest of Metals, Gold, if foliated, is {{transparent}}, and all Metals become transparent if dissolved in <b>Menstruums</b> or vitrified, the Opacity of white Metals ariseth not from their Density alone. They being less dense than Gold would be more transparent than it, did not some other Cause concur with their Density to make them opake. And this Cause I take to be such a Bigness of their Particles as fits them to reflect the white of the first order. For, if they be of other Thicknesses they may reflect other Colours, as is manifest by the Colours which appear upon hot Steel in tempering it, and sometimes upon the Surface of melted Metals in the Skin or Scoria which arises upon them in their cooling. And as the white of the first order is the strongest which can be made by Plates of transparent Substances, so it ought to be stronger in the denser Substances of Metals than in the rarer of Air, Water, and Glass. Nor do I see but that metallick Substances of such a Thickness as may fit them to reflect the white of the first order, may, by reason of their great Density (according to the Tenor of the first of these Propositions) reflect all the Light incident upon them, and so be as opake and splendent as it's possible for any Body to be. Gold, or Copper mix'd with less than half their Weight of Silver, or Tin, or Regulus of Antimony, in fusion, or amalgamed with a very little Mercury, become white; which shews both that the Particles of white Metals have much more Superficies, and so are smaller, than those of Gold and Copper, and also that they are so opake as not to suffer the Particles of Gold or Copper to shine through them. Now it is scarce to be doubted but that the Colours of Gold and Copper are of the second and third order, and therefore the Particles of white Metals cannot be much bigger than is requisite to make them reflect the white of the first order. The Volatility of Mercury argues that they are not much bigger, nor may they be much less, lest they lose their Opacity, and become either transparent as they do when attenuated by Vitrification, or by Solution in <b>Menstruums,</b> or black as they do when ground smaller, by rubbing Silver, or Tin, or Lead, upon other Substances to draw black Lines. The first and only Colour which white Metals take by grinding their Particles smaller, is black, and therefore their white ought to be that which borders upon the black Spot in the Center of the Rings of Colours, that is, the white of the first order. But, if you would hence gather the Bigness of metallick Particles, you must allow for their Density. For were Mercury transparent, its Density is such that the Sine of Incidence upon it (by my Computation) would be to the Sine of its Refraction, as 71 to 20, or 7 to 2. And therefore the Thickness of its Particles, that they may exhibit the same Colours with those of Bubbles of Water, ought to be less than the Thickness of the Skin of those Bubbles in the Proportion of 2 to 7. Whence it's possible, that the Particles of Mercury may be as little as the Particles of some transparent and volatile Fluids, and yet reflect the white of the first order.|$|R

60|$|Ikey roomed and breakfasted at Mrs. Riddle's two squares away. Mrs. Riddle had a {{daughter}} named Rosy. The circumlocution has been in vain--you must have guessed it--Ikey adored Rosy. She tinctured all his thoughts; she was the compound extract of all that was chemically pure and officinal--the dispensatory contained nothing equal to her. But Ikey was timid, and his hopes remained insoluble in the <b>menstruum</b> of his backwardness and fears. Behind his counter he was a superior being, calmly conscious of special knowledge and worth; outside he was a weak-kneed, purblind, motorman-cursed rambler, with ill-fitting clothes stained with chemicals and smelling of socotrine aloes and valerianate of ammonia.|$|E
60|$|Taking {{for data}} the {{appearances}} of the Earth's crust {{in a narrow}} district of Germany; observing the constant order of superposition of strata, and their respective physical characters; Werner drew the inference that strata of like characters succeeded each other in like order over the entire surface of the Earth. And seeing, from the laminated structure of many formations and the organic remains contained in others, that they were sedimentary; he further inferred that these universal strata had been in succession precipitated from a chaotic <b>menstruum</b> which once covered our planet. Thus, on a very incomplete acquaintance with a thousandth part of the Earth's crust, he based a sweeping generalization applying to the whole of it. This Neptunist hypothesis, mark, borne out though {{it seemed to be}} by the most conspicuous surrounding facts, was quite untenable if analyzed. That a universal chaotic <b>menstruum</b> should deposit a series of numerous sharply-defined strata, differing from one another in composition, is incomprehensible. That the strata so deposited should contain the remains of plants and animals, which could not have lived under the supposed conditions, is still more incomprehensible. Physically absurd, however, as was this hypothesis, it recognized, though under a distorted form, one of the great agencies of geological change--the action of water. It served also to express the fact, that the formations of the Earth's crust stand in some kind of order. Further, it did a little towards supplying a nomenclature, without which much progress was impossible. Lastly, it furnished a standard with which successions of strata in various regions could be compared, the differences noted, and the actual sections tabulated. It was the first provisional generalization; and was useful, if not indispensable, as a step to truer ones.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{that they}} do so will appear by the {{affinity}} of their Properties. The finely colour'd Feathers of some Birds, and particularly those of Peacocks Tails, do, in the very same part of the Feather, appear of several Colours in several Positions of the Eye, after the very same manner that thin Plates were found {{to do in the}} 7th and 19th Observations, and therefore their Colours arise from the thinness of the transparent parts of the Feathers; that is, from the slenderness of the very fine Hairs, or Capillamenta, which grow out of the sides of the grosser lateral Branches or Fibres of those Feathers. And to the same purpose it is, that the Webs of some Spiders, by being spun very fine, have appeared colour'd, as some have observ'd, and that the colour'd Fibres of some Silks, by varying the Position of the Eye, do vary their Colour. Also the Colours of Silks, Cloths, and other Substances, which Water or Oil can intimately penetrate, become more faint and obscure by being immerged in those Liquors, and recover their Vigor again by being dried; much after the manner declared of thin Bodies in the 10th and 21st Observations. Leaf-Gold, some sorts of painted Glass, the Infusion of Lignum Nephriticum, and some other Substances, reflect one Colour, and transmit another; like thin Bodies in the 9th and 20th Observations. And some of those colour'd Powders which Painters use, may have their Colours a little changed, by being very elaborately and finely ground. Where I see not what can be justly pretended for those changes, besides the breaking of their parts into less parts by that contrition, after the same manner that the Colour of a thin Plate is changed by varying its thickness. For which reason also it is that the colour'd Flowers of Plants and Vegetables, by being bruised, usually become more transparent than before, or at least in some degree or other change their Colours. Nor is it much less to my purpose, that, by mixing divers Liquors, very odd and remarkable Productions and Changes of Colours may be effected, of which no cause can be more obvious and rational than that the saline Corpuscles of one Liquor do variously act upon or unite with the tinging Corpuscles of another, so as to make them swell, or shrink, (whereby not only their bulk but their density also may be changed,) or to divide them into smaller Corpuscles, (whereby a colour'd Liquor may become transparent,) or to make many of them associate into one cluster, whereby two transparent Liquors may compose a colour'd one. For we see how apt those saline <b>Menstruums</b> are to penetrate and dissolve Substances to which they are applied, and some of them to precipitate what others dissolve. In like manner, if we consider the various Phænomena of the Atmosphere, we may observe, that when Vapours are first raised, they hinder not the transparency of the Air, being divided into parts too small to cause any Reflexion in their Superficies. But when in order to compose drops of Rain they begin to coalesce and constitute Globules of all intermediate sizes, those Globules, when they become of convenient size to reflect some Colours and transmit others, may constitute Clouds of various Colours according to their sizes. And I see not what can be rationally conceived in so transparent a Substance as Water for the production of these Colours, besides the various sizes of its fluid and globular Parcels.|$|R
60|$|If {{you take}} Blue Smalt, you shall find, that {{to afford the}} deepest Blue, which cæteris paribus has the {{greatest}} particles or sands; and if you further divide, or grind those particles on a Grindstone, or porphyry stone, you may by comminuting the sands of it, dilute the Blue into as pale a one as you please, which you cannot do by laying the colour thin; for wheresoever any single particle is, it exhibits as deep a Blue as the whole mass. Now, there are other Blues, which though never so much ground, will not be diluted by grinding, because consisting of very small particles, very deeply ting'd, they cannot by grinding be actually separated into smaller particles then {{the operation of the}} fire, or some other dissolving <b>menstruum,</b> reduc'd them to already.|$|E
60|$|And, First, I {{found it}} ought to be {{exceeding}} quick, such as those motions of fermentation and putrefaction, whereby, certainly, the parts are exceeding nimbly and violently mov'd; and that, because we find those motions are able more minutely to shatter and divide the body, then the most violent heats menstruums we yet know. And that fire is nothing else but such a dissolution of the Burning body, made by the most universal <b>menstruum</b> of all sulphureous bodies, namely, the Air, we shall in an other place of this Tractate endeavour to make probable. And that, in all extreamly hot shining bodies, there is a very quick motion that causes Light, as well as a more robust that causes Heat, may be argued from the celerity wherewith the bodyes are dissolv'd.|$|E
