40|$|The Sun’s {{long-term}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>variability</b> is {{the primary}} driver of space climate. This variability is manifested {{not only in the}} longobserved and dramatic change of magnetic fields on the solar surface, but also in the changing solar radiative output across all wavelengths. The Sun’s <b>magnetic</b> <b>variability</b> also modulates the particulate and magnetic fluxes in the heliosphere, which determine the interplanetary conditions and impose significant electromagnetic forces and effects upon planetary atmospheres. All these effects due to the changing solar magnetic fields are also relevant for planetary climates, including the climate of the Earth. The ultimate cause of solar variability, at time scales much shorter than stellar evolutionary time scales, i. e., at decadal to centennial and, maybe, even millennial or longer scales, has its origin in the solar dynamo mechanism. Therefore, in order to better understand the origin of space climate, one must analyze different proxies of solar <b>magnetic</b> <b>variability</b> and develop models of the solar dynamo mechanism that correctly produce the observed properties of the magnetic fields. This Preface summarizes the most important findings of the papers of this Special Issue, most of which were presented in the Space Climate- 4 Symposium organized in 2011 in Goa, India.

40|$|We {{carried out}} a {{detailed}} rock magnetic and paleomagnetic study of deep-sea sediments from selected intervals of Site 1233 {{in order to assess}} whether they contain reproducible evidence for submillennial-scale environmental, climatic, and geomagnetic field variability. Three 1. 5 -m sediment intervals from oxygen isotope Stages 1, 2, and 3 were sampled using continuous U-channels; replicate sediment sequences were collected from two or three holes in each interval to test for reproducibility. Rock magnetic and paleomagnetic measurements were made at 1 - cm intervals. Rock magnetic results identify distinctive centennial (150 – 300 yr) - and millennial-scale variability that is probably continuous over the entire Site 1233 record. They also show evidence for intermittent multidecadal-scale rock <b>magnetic</b> <b>variability.</b> The rock <b>magnetic</b> <b>variability</b> allows us to modify the meters composite depth (mcd) correlation {{in each of the three}} high-resolution intervals to permit correlations between holes at 5 -cm resolution. Paleomagnetic results indicate that there is also a reproducible pattern of paleomagnetic secular variation at the centennial to millennial scale. The centennial-scale variability is dominated by 5 °– 10 ° oscillations in both inclination and declination with an average interval of 200 – 300 yr. Deconvolution studies and paleomagnetic secular variation (PSV) correlations between holes both suggest that the PSVs are real and not caused by similar-scale rock <b>magnetic</b> <b>variability.</b> The paleomagnetic results also document distinctive, larger-amplitude multicentennial- and millennial-scale directional variability that is consistent with preliminary shipboard paleomagnetic studies...|$|E

These simple techniques are supplementary tools to the advanced facilities developed for the analysis of SuperDARN, IMAGE, and CARISMA arrays.

40|$|As {{a part of}} the {{long-term}} program at Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO), the Mn I 539. 4 nm line has been observed for nearly three solar cycles using the McMath telescope and the 13. 5 m spectrograph in double-pass mode. These full-disk spectrophotometric observations revealed an unusually strong change of this line's parameters over the solar cycle. Optical pumping by the Mg II k line was originally proposed to explain these variations. More recent studies have proposed that this is not required and that the <b>magnetic</b> <b>variability</b> might explain it. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>variability</b> is also the mechanism that drives the changes in total solar irradiance variations (TSI). With this work we investigate this proposition quantitatively by using using the model SATIRE-S. We applied exactly the same model atmospheres and value of the free parameter as were used in previous solar irradiance reconstructions to now model the variation in the Mn I 539. 4 nm line profile and in neighboring Fe I lines. We compared the results of the theoretical model with KPNO observations. Our result confirms that optical pumping of the Mn I 539. 4 nm line by Mg II k is not the main cause of its solar cycle change. It also provides independent confirmation of solar irradiance models which are {{based on the assumption that}} irradiance variations are caused by the evolution of the solar surface magnetic flux. The result obtained here also supports the spectral irradiance variations computed by these models. Comment: accepted in A&...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{variability}} of solar activity using new photospheric proxies originally developed {{for the analysis of}} stellar magnetism with the CoRoT and Kepler photometric observations. These proxies are obtained by tracking the temporal modulations in the observations associated to the spots and magnetic features as the Sun rotates. We analyze here 21 years, spanning solar cycles 23 and 24, of the observations collected by the space-based photometric VIRGO and radial velocity GOLF instruments on board the SoHO satellite. The photospheric activity proxy S ph is then calculated {{for each of the three}} VIRGO photometers as well as the associated S vel proxy from the radial velocity GOLF observations. Comparisons with several standard solar activity proxies sensitive to different layers of the Sun demonstrate that these new activity proxies, S ph and S vel, provide a new manner to monitor solar activity. We show that both the long-and short-term <b>magnetic</b> <b>variabilities</b> respectively associated to the 11 -year cycle and the quasi-biennial oscillation are well monitored, and that the magnetic field interaction between the subsurface, the photosphere, and the chromosphere of the Sun, was modified between Cycle 24 and Cycle 23.

30|$|The {{application}} of {{techniques of the}} Φ-MLT snapshots and magnetic keograms to magnetic variations ΔB and time derivative dB/dt enabled us to reveal interesting features of the geomagnetic field variability, in particular, to indicate spatial location of fast variations responsible for GICs. The latitude-MLT mapping of magnetic disturbances from a world-wide array of magnetometers shows that the region with the highest <b>magnetic</b> <b>variability</b> does not coincide with a substorm “epicenter” but is predominantly shifted poleward. The magnetic keogram provides an easy-to-use visualization tool showing where the latitudinal structure of a region with elevated |dX/dt| magnitude is.

A study is carried out by including solar wind velocity (Vsw), proton number density (Np) and the Bz component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF Bz) obtained from the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) satellite as separate inputs to the NN each along with day number of the year (DN), hour (HR), a 4 -month running mean of the daily sunspot number (R 4) and the running mean of the previous eight 3 -hourly magnetic A index values (A 8). Hourly GPS TEC values derived from a dual frequency receiver located at Sutherland (32. 38 &deg; S, 20. 81 &deg; E), South Africa for 8 years (2000 – 2007) have been used to train the Elman neural network (ENN) and the result has been used to predict TEC variations for a GPS station located at Cape Town (33. 95 &deg; S, 18. 47 &deg; E). Quantitative results indicate that each of the parameters considered may have some degree of influence on GPS TEC at certain periods although a decrease in prediction accuracy is also observed for some parameters for different days and seasons. It is also evident that there is still a difficulty in predicting TEC values during disturbed conditions. The improvements and degradation in prediction accuracies are both close to the benchmark values which lends weight to the belief that diurnal, seasonal, solar and <b>magnetic</b> <b>variabilities</b> may be the major determinants of TEC variability...|$|R

40|$|Self-sustaining {{numerical}} dynamos {{are used}} to infer the sources of low-frequency secular variation of the geomagnetic field. Gravitational dynamo models powered by compositional convection in an electrically conducting, rotating fluid shell exhibit several regimes of magnetic field behavior with an increasing Rayleigh number of the convection, including nearly steady dipoles, chaotic nonreversing dipoles, and chaotic reversing dipoles. The time average dipole strength and dipolarity of the magnetic field decrease, whereas the dipole variability, average dipole tilt angle, and frequency of polarity reversals increase with Rayleigh number. Chaotic gravitational dynamos have large-amplitude dipole secular variation with maximum power at frequencies corresponding to a few cycles per million years on Earth. Their external magnetic field structure, dipole statistics, low-frequency power spectra, and polarity reversal frequency are comparable to the geomagnetic field.

30|$|Magnitude ΔX of the X-component {{magnetic}} bay {{is used to}} characterize the global structure of magnetic activity and the ionospheric electrojet intensity. To quantify {{the magnitude of the}} <b>magnetic</b> field <b>variability,</b> time derivatives dX/dt and dY/dt are calculated. The earlier examinations of ΔB and dB/dt spatial structures revealed the occurrence of localized (scales about 103  km and less) structures embedded in the main electrojet (Viljanen 1997). Current amplitudes in such structures can be small, so they hardly can be discriminated from global ΔB pattern. However, the temporal changes associated with these medium-scale structures are fast, so they are clearly seen in the dB/dt distribution. In magnetograms, this feature is observed during disturbed periods as a large Δ X ≫Δ Y, but about equal time derivatives dX/dt and dY/dt (Viljanen et al. 2001). Therefore, for the analysis we use the magnitude of the total time derivative of the horizontal magnetic component | dB/dt| = √((dX/dt)^ 2 + (dY/dt)^ 2).|$|R
30|$|The {{storm of}} March 17, 2015, was very geoeffective. During this storm, auroral {{phenomena}} were observed even {{at very low}} latitudes. Van Allen Probes observations showed that relativistic electrons experienced rapid acceleration up to ~[*] 7 [*]MeV within two[*]days after the initial substantial dropout (Li et al. 2016). A significant factor of the storm’s geoeffectiveness is the <b>magnetic</b> field <b>variability,</b> characterized by time derivative dB/dt (Boteler et al. 1998). The dB/dt effect of magnetic spikes causes geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) that may have damaging effects on ground-based technology systems (Lanzerotti 2001). GICs are produced by fast medium-scale variations of the geomagnetic field rather than much more intense large-scale current systems (Viljanen 1997). Therefore, the examination of fine features of the geomagnetic field variability is very important not only for understanding the fundamentals of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, but also for predicting GIC intensity. A set of efficient data analysis tools is necessary to reveal fine features of geomagnetic field variations.|$|R

The perimeter tracing method detects PCH boundaries along the solar limb, using full-disk images from the SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory/Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SOHO/EIT). One synoptic-map method uses the line-of-sight magnetic field from the SOHO/Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) to determine the unipolarity boundaries near the poles.

Magnetic particles extracted from 20 representative samples were also examined for their mineral, chemical compositions and micromorphology. Results indicate that MS values range between - 7. 73 x 10 (- 8) and 45. 06 x 10 (- 8) m(3) /kg. The high MS zones occur at some hydrocarbon-bearing basins and along main tectonic zones, and low ones are distributed mainly within the river delta or along continental shelves. Iron concretions and manganese concretions are not main contributors for high MS values in sediments, while authigenic iron sulphide minerals are possibly responsible for the MS enhancement. This phenomenon is suspected to be produced by the reducing environment where the high upward venting methane beneath the seafloor reacts with seawater sulfate, resulting in seep precipitation of highly susceptible intermediate mineral pyrrhotite, greigite and paramagnetic pyrite. It suggests that MS variability is possibly one of the geochemical indicators for mapping sub-sea zones of methane venting in the southern SCS...|$|E
