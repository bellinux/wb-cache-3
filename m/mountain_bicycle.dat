40|$|Many traffic {{collisions}} involve <b>mountain</b> <b>bicycles.</b> An {{important aspect}} of reconstructing these collisions is the braking and acceleration capability of the bicycle. Currently there are few published sources of acceleration, braking, and rolling resistance data for <b>mountain</b> <b>bicycles.</b> This project sought to fill this void by executing 116 acceleration, braking, and rolling resistance tests. A Stalker ATS radar unit was used for determining bicycle speed at 0. 03 -second intervals and at 0. 016 kilometer-per-hour increments. These tests were documented with video and still cameras, {{as well as a}} total station. The average acceleration, braking, and rolling resistance rates for each of the tests are provided below in tabular format. Based on the technical specifications of the Stalker ATS radar unit, these rates are accurate to ± 0. 01 g. For the tests on dirt trails, five <b>mountain</b> <b>bicycles</b> and one cyclo-cross bicycle were ridden on- 2 % and- 11 % slopes. A total of nine acceleration and two rolling resistance tests were completed on the- 2 % slope, while thirty-four braking tests were made on both the- 2 % and the- 11 % slopes. For the testing on pavement, five <b>mountain</b> <b>bicycles,</b> one cyclo-cross bicycle, and one road bicycle were ridden on- 1 % and + 1 % slopes. A total of fourteen rolling resistance, fifteen acceleration, and forty-two brake tests were made on both asphalt and Portland concrete. The results of these tests demonstrate the superiority of the front brake over the rear brake. These tests also indicated only slightly better braking on pavement than on dirt. The stopping ability of the rear brake is about 76 % of the front brake, and is about 65 % of the front and rear brakes combined. Acceleration rates were found to be about 25 % higher on pavement than on dirt...|$|R
