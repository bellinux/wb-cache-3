He brought in 23-year-old Telford defender Sean Newton and 18-year-old Sunderland keeper Lewis King on loan, whilst signing 19-year-old Lancaster City midfielder Danny Hattersley on a permanent transfer.

Gui also said, [...] "Although I have Swedish citizenship, I truly feel that I am still Chinese — my roots are in China. So I hope Sweden can respect my personal choice, respect my rights and privacy of my personal choice and allow me to resolve my own problems". Criminal investigations on other charges were said to be in progress. It was only on 19 January, when fellow Swedish citizen Peter Dahlin, cofounder of an NGO providing legal training for local lawyers in China, appeared on television, confessing to having violated Chinese law and [...] "caused harm to the Chinese government [...] hurt the feelings of the Chinese people", that it came to international attention that Gui had also confessed on television; Dahlin was subsequently deported.

500|$|Early {{before the}} release of B'Day in 2006, Knowles held a {{nationwide}} audition for female musicians which ended in Sony Music Studios {{where she and her}} father and collaborator Mathew Knowles were among the judges. The auditions searched for keyboard players, bassists, guitarists, horn players, percussionists and drummers with stops in New Jersey, Atlanta, Burbank, Chicago and Houston. The musicians were asked to re-create the performance of [...] "Work It Out" [...] from the live album Live at Wembley (2004) and be able to perform at least a one-minute solo. Knowles stated that her goal was to get together a group of [...] "fierce, talented, hungry, beautiful" [...] women and form an all-female band. Speaking about her tour and the decision to form a band, Knowles said, [...] "I'm all about female empowerment. I'm all about pushing the envelope. I know it's <b>my</b> <b>responsibility</b> to do something different. I said, 'I want a band, I want something different.'" [...] She further described the process of choosing the contestants during an interview, saying: [...] "I had worldwide auditions; people flew in from Atlanta, Houston, Israel, all over the world. It was extremely difficult [...] [...] so many talented women. I wanted only a nine-piece band, but the girls were so amazing, I couldn't decide. I think I'm going to wind up having 12 people so I have two [...] certain instruments, because [...] were just brilliant. It's a thing called star quality, it's a thing you can't put your finger on, can't describe. When they were playing, I said, 'I want to see y'all battle.' I brought in two of every instrument and that's how I chose. You see the one that really wants it. It was so entertaining, the energy, seeing the girls battle ... God, it was the best. It was magical." [...] Between segments of the show, Suga Mama performed periodic instrumental interludes, with every member giving a solo so Knowles could change her costumes seven times. Describing them as [...] "fantastic", Eamon Sweeney of the Irish Independent noted that [...] "the interval music works perfectly... but two excruciating drum solos are absolutely unnecessary".|$|E
