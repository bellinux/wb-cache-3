40|$|Malaria is {{a devastating}} global health issue that affects {{approximately}} 200 million people yearly and {{over half a}} million deaths are caused by this parasitic protozoan disease. Most commercially available drugs only target the blood stage form of the parasite, {{but the only way}} to ensure proper elimination is to treat the exoerythrocytic stages of the parasite development cycle. There is a demand for the discovery of new liver stage antimalarial compounds as there are only two current FDA approved drugs for the treatment of liver stage parasites, one of which fails to eliminate dormant forms and the other inducing hemolytic anemia in patients with G 6 PD deficiency. In efforts to address the dire need for liver stage drugs, we developed a high-throughput liver stage drug-screening assay to identify liver stage active compounds {{from a wide variety of}} chemical libraries with known blood stage activity. The liver stage screen led us to further investigate an old, abandoned compound known as <b>menoctone.</b> <b>Menoctone</b> was developed as a liver stage active antimalarial, however, the development of more potent compounds led to the abandonment of further <b>menoctone</b> research. Our research demonstrated that resistant parasites can transmit mutations through mosquitoes, which was previously believed to not be possible. Furthermore, we studied a novel genetic marker that may indicate potential resistance against malaria parasite infection and the cytotoxic effects associated with the disease. Future experiments aim to identify and advance our methods for the elimination of Plasmodium exoerythrocytic parasites...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} {{has been}} made of the effects of a range of antiprotozoal drugs and other metabolic inhibitors upon growing promastigotes and transforming amasti-gotes of Leishmania mexicana mexicana. Amastigotes transforming to promasti-gotes in vitro were highly susceptible to 2 -mercaptoacetate, 4 -pentenoate, a-difluoromethylornithine, ethidium bromide, acridine orange, pentamidine isethionate, allopurinol, amphotericin B, <b>menoctone</b> and pentostam. Promasti-gotes were in most cases less sensitive to these inhibitors. The results reiterate that the biochemical differences between the two developmental forms are reflected in their sensitivities to inhibitors. The transformation in vitro of Leishmania amastigotes to promastigotes may be a useful model for use as a primary screen for antileishmanial agents...|$|E
