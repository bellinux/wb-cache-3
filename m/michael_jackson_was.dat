This list, however, only documents the songs explicitly cited as being unreleased and, therefore, does not contain every unreleased Jackson song registered with such bodies.|$|E

Two of Jackson's sisters, Janet and La Toya, provided backing vocals in the guise of the P.Y.T.s. The two sisters sang [...] "na na na" [...] back at their brother {{towards the end of the}} song. It has a tempo of 126 beats per minute, making it one of Jackson's fastest songs.|$|E

500|$|After {{arranging}} {{a recording}} contract with A Records in 1982 for a then sixteen-year-old Janet, her father Joseph Jackson oversaw the entire production of her debut album, Janet Jackson, and its follow-up, Dream Street (1984); {{the latter of}} which was written and produced by Jesse Johnson and Janet's brothers Marlon and <b>Michael.</b> <b>Jackson</b> <b>was</b> initially reluctant to begin a recording career, commenting [...] "I was coming off of a TV show that I absolutely hated doing, Fame. I didn't want to do [...] I {{wanted to go to}} college. But I did it for my father..." [...] and elaborated that she was often in conflict with her producers. Amidst her professional struggles, she rebelled against her family's wishes by marrying James DeBarge of the family recording group DeBarge in 1984. The Jacksons disapproved of the relationship, citing DeBarge's immaturity and substance abuse. Jackson left her husband in January 1985 and was granted an annulment later that year.|$|E

500|$|HIStory {{received}} generally positive reviews.

He's the main asset of his own corporation, which is a profitable subsidiary of Sony". Some reviewers commented on the unusual format of a new studio album being accompanied by a [...] "greatest hits" [...] collection, with Q magazine saying [...] "from the new songs' point of view, it's like taking your dad with you into a fight."

500|$|By the mid-1980s, ATV Music Publishing and Pye Records {{were both}} up for sale.

Jackson grew more excited as he examined the pages. He inquired about how to buy songs and what the songs were used for. McCartney explained that music publishing was a way to make big money. Jackson replied by telling McCartney that he would buy The Beatles' songs one day. McCartney laughed, saying [...] "Great. Good joke." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Stark Raving Dad" [...] {{was written}} {{specifically}} for Michael Jackson, {{a fan of}} the show, who had called Groening one night and offered to do a guest spot. The offer was accepted and a script was written by Al Jean and Mike Reiss, based on an idea pitched by James L. Brooks. Creator Matt Groening and co-executive producer Sam Simon also contributed significantly to the writing of the episode. In an early version of the script, Homer decided to take his alcoholic friend Barney Gumble in for rehab, but while there Homer began acting crazily so the doctors assumed he was the one to be committed. It was later changed to Homer being hospitalized for wearing a pink shirt, an idea pitched by Brooks. Michael Jackson pitched several story ideas for the episode, such as Bart telling everyone in town that <b>Michael</b> <b>Jackson</b> <b>was</b> coming to his house. He also requested that there be a scene in which he and Bart wrote a song together and asked that a joke about Prince be changed to one about Elvis Presley.|$|E

500|$|West {{received}} similar {{approval from}} Lil Wayne and Young Jeezy, {{both of whom}} contributed to the album. During an interview, when asked what music today inspires him, Wayne stated [...] "everybody's doing their thing, but they're not exciting. Everybody {{is doing the same}} thing. That's terrible. Do I love the music that's out right now? I love it with a passion. Does it motivate me? Not one bit. That's because 808s & Heartbreak isn't out yet." [...] Despite the approval from the rap superstars, as well as the record-breaking chart performances of the first two singles, hip hop audiences remained indifferent towards the album, predicting it would flop. Responding to reviews, West stated that he didn't care about sales or getting good ratings, saying that it came from the heart and that's all that matters to him. When asked about the current state of hip hop, West compared it to a high school, stating that hip hop used to be all about being fearless and standing out, and that now it is about being afraid and fitting in. <b>Michael</b> <b>Jackson</b> <b>was</b> an admirer of the album, with his daughter saying he played it for her [...] "all the time".|$|E

I really appreciate what music was back then {{as well as in the}} early '90s when you had artists like Troop and Jodeci, and <b>Michael</b> <b>Jackson</b> <b>was</b> in his prime." [...] Usher explained that the album's lyrics also reflect on what has been going on with his relationship; 8701 is predominantly an R album. [...] "Can U Help Me", is about a deep relationship to which Usher experienced. [...] "U Don't Have to Call" [...] is a hip-hop song inspired by Jackson, while [...] "U Got It Bad" [...] is an R slow-jam. About [...] "U Got It Bad", Kyle Anderson of MTV wrote that it makes use of the acoustic guitar and a [...] "slow-burning bassline" [...] throughout. The album's lead single [...] "U Remind Me" [...] is also an R track, and its lyrics is based on meeting a woman who reminds Usher of an ex-girlfriend, and therefore cannot date her.|$|E
