40|$|Abstract. A quasi-three-dimensional {{suspended}} {{sediment transport}} model {{was developed and}} generalized to include combined wave-current effects to study bottom sediment resuspension and transport in southern Lake Michigan. The results from a three-dimensional circulation model and a wind wave model were used as input to the sediment transport model. Two effects of nonlinear wave-current interactions were considered in the sediment transport model: the changes in turbulence intensity due to waves and the enhancement of induced bottom shear stresses. Empirical formulations of sediment entrainment and resuspension processes were established and parameterized by laboratory data and field studies in the lake. In this preliminary application of the model to Lake Michigan, only a single grain size is used to characterize the sedimentary material, and {{the bottom of the}} lake is treated as an unlimited sediment source. The model results were compared with measured suspended sediment concentrations at two stations and several municipal water intake turbidity measurements in southern Lake Michigan during November–December 1994. The model was able to reproduce the general patterns of high-turbidity events in the lake. A model simulation for the entire 1994 – 1995 two-year period gave a reasonable description of sediment erosion/deposition in the lake, and the modeled settling mass fluxes were consistent with sediment trap data. The <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> sediment <b>resuspension</b> and transport in southern Lake Michigan are discussed. To improve the model, sediment classifications, spatial bottom sediment distribution, sediment source function, and tributary sediment discharge should be considered. 1...|$|R

40|$|The main {{theme of}} this work is to enhance the {{understanding}} {{on the behavior of}} solid particles in flows of Newtonian or viscoelastic fluids by using both two-dimensional and three-dimensional direct numerical simulations (DNS). A large-scale state-of-the-art software package PARTMOVER 3 D is developed based on an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) technique and an Elastic-Viscous-Stress-Split (EVSS) scheme. Our numerical results are extensively compared with analytical, experimental and numerical ones in the literature. ^ We studied the motion of spheres sedimenting in a cylindrical tube filled with a Newtonian fluid. The hydrodynamic drag and lift on the particle are investigated under various conditions. The effects of the tube wall, in terms of the blockage ratio and the eccentricity ratio, on the particle terminal velocity, migration and rotation are studied. We also investigated the interaction between pair particles released in tandem or side by side at different Reynolds numbers. ^ The migration of particles in a pressure driven flow is the heart of vast number of industrial applications. Using 3 -D direct numerical simulations, we systematically investigated the independent parameters controlling the particle migration, which are the blockage ratio, the flow Reynolds number, and the solid-liquid density ratio. During the particle migration, the <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> the fluid inertia, the wall confinement, the local flow shear rate, the particle slip velocity, the particle size, and the particle rotation were extensively examined through the stress distribution on the particle surface under different flow conditions. ^ In the presence of a shear flow, an initially deposited bed of heavy particles will be entrained into the bulk fluid and convected away with the flow. We investigated the <b>mechanism</b> <b>of</b> this particle <b>resuspension</b> by using 2 -D direct numerical simulations. Various effects on the lift force on the particle was analyzed by examining the distribution of the stress on the particle surface. We also studied the orientation of an elliptic particle during its resuspension, analyzed the interaction between a pair of particles, and presented the results <b>of</b> the <b>resuspension</b> <b>of</b> a layer of particles. ^ There are striking differences of particle motions in viscoelastic and Newtonian fluids. We explained the <b>mechanism</b> <b>of</b> the anomalous particle behavior due to the elasticity of the viscoelastic fluid. The effects of the Deborah number, the Reynolds number, the retardation-relaxation time ratio, the blockage ratio, and the eccentricity rate on the behavior of the particles were also systemically investigated. ...|$|R
40|$|Sediment {{resuspension}} is initiated {{through a}} variety <b>of</b> <b>mechanisms</b> across the wave breaking, run-up, and run-down stages {{that occur in the}} wave breaking, surf, and swash zones. When a wave breaks offshore, the plunging jet rarely reaches the bed directly; however, this injection of momentum generates turbulence that propagates through the water column, creating local stresses as turbulent eddies interact with the seafloor. When these stresses are sufficient to resuspend sediment from the bed, the sediment can become entrained in the flow, and thus both turbulence and sediment are advected shoreward during onshore directed phases of the wave cycle. It is at this time that the fluid is highly turbid, filled with sediment and debris. As the flow enters the swash zone, it runs upshore and slows, and the sediment settles out of entrainment and is deposited onshore. Then, as this relatively clear fluid flow retreats and regains speed in flowing down the beach face, sediment is again resuspended into the flow. But upon careful observation, the turbid region is constrained {{to the base of the}} water column due to shear-dominated resuspenions as a boundary layer grows. The resuspension during the latter event can be attributed to an increased bed shear stress, due to the uniform mean flow along the sediment bed. This mechanism for resuspension is well-understood, as thorough experimental research has led to well-characterized parameters such as the Shields Curve that identify requisite shear stresses for sediment resuspension. However, the former mechanism, in which sediment is resuspended due to the interaction of large-scale turbulent motions, has seen far less research, because of the difficulty in isolating this particular flow in the laboratory and identifying meaningful parameters of the flow necessary for incipient particle motion from the bed. We have chosen to isolate the phenomenon <b>of</b> sediment <b>resuspension</b> by turbulence absent mean shear in the laboratory to better understand this fundamental process. By adapting a turbulence chamber in the DeFrees Hydraulics Lab developed by Variano & Cowen (2008), in which a Randomly Actuated Synthetic Jet Array (RASJA; Variano and Cowen, 2008) is suspended above a tank of water, with jets directed downward, we have a nearly ideal facility for examining decaying horizontally homogeneous isotropic turbulence above a bed. The jets fire according to a specified random algorithm to generate homogeneous isotropic turbulence without inducing mean flows. With a solid glass bottom boundary in place, data were collected with Acoustic Doppler Velocimetry (ADV) and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements to characterize profiles of the mean flow, turbulence intensity, and kinetic energy. Statistics such as spatial and temporal spectra and parameters of mean flow strength were computed to understand the nature of the turbulence in the facility, revealing a well developed inertial subrange and very weak mean flows [...] The glass was then replaced with a sediment bed, and the tests were repeated to make a direct comparison between the solid and sediment beds. During the sediment tests, resuspension was observed intermittently. We were surprised to find that a rippled pattern quickly evolved in the sand bed, even with relatively few visible resuspension events. Preliminary tests have been performed to examine the relationships between the forced turbulence levels and the <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>resuspension,</b> and we have also performed qualitative studies to investigate the influence of the presence of solid boundaries and turbulence on bed morphology. In order to quantitatively analyze the nec- essary stresses and fluid structures present, a conditional quadrant analysis is performed on the Reynolds stresses. A small project was included to test the performance of a Nortek Aquadopp High Resolution Profiler in the facility. Though the profiler is designed to capture large-scale environmental flows that are uniform across its beams at a given elevation from its transducer face, this investigation was performed to test the instrument's capability to capture high levels of turbulence in a small facility where this assumption breaks down. Direct comparisons were made to simultaneous PIV measurements, and measurements from the Profiler were included in the overall tank characterization...|$|R

The stations were situated on different bottom types in the western, central and eastern part, respectively, of the open GoF. The fluxes were measured in-situ using the autonomous Göteborg benthic lander. To simulate resuspension events, the stirring speed was increased {{in two of the}} four chambers of the lander after approximately half of the incubation time. The other two chambers were used as control chambers. Clear effects <b>of</b> <b>resuspension</b> were observed on the oxygen fluxes where an increase of the consumption was observed in 88 % of the cases and on average with 59 (stdev= 53) %.

The aim for Experiment 2 was to investigate how different concentrations of resuspended sediment affect the degradation rate of organic matter. Sediment samples were collected in December and late March at a marine field station, Askö, Sweden. Sediment and bottom water were transferred to and incubated in sealed bottles. For Experiment 1, resuspension was created in bottles with a specially designed rotary table, creating different intensity of water movements. In Experiment 2, bottles with different concentrations of sediment were put on an ordinary rotary table. The mineralisation rates were in both experiments monitored by daily sampling of sediment-water slurry, and analysed for total inorganic carbon by a gas chromatography with a thermal detector, GC-TCD.

The empirical model <b>of</b> plutonium aerosol <b>resuspension</b> is based on the aerophysics, the geognosy and the radiochemistry. This method was applied to analyze the representative plutonium contaminated regions. The results indicate that soil erosion is the intrinsic factor <b>of</b> <b>resuspension</b> process. The resuspended concentrations of plutonium aerosols in nuclear test sites are much less severe than those in the “non-nuclear ” test sites (safety shots and simulated nuclear accident tests). Short-term, orders-of-magnitude fluctuations of the airborne concentrations are observed due to the natural and man-made disturbances. After systematic soil cleanup the resuspended plutonium aerosol concentration could fall down to the public allowable level...|$|R
40|$|A model <b>of</b> <b>resuspension</b> and air {{transport}} of particles {{has been used}} in a scenario of natural contamination in Palomares, Spain, to improve the understanding of the available data on soil and air concentrations. Meteorological conditions in 1988 and air concentrations measured over several years and at four points have been used to calibrate the model. The model predicts the order of magnitude of the air concentration within a factor of 3 at the points with the measurements available. This has made it possible to estimate the order of magnitude <b>of</b> the <b>resuspension</b> rate and deposition velocity in the area. The resuspension factor shows abnormally low values in relation to the large mass loading observed. This seems {{to be related to the}} association of a large fraction of plutonium with large particles. The limitations of the model used and the data available have been studied and some further approaches are suggested to improve the understanding of the processes of regional transport.

40|$|Dust is {{generated}} in fusion reactors from plasma erosion of plasma facing components within the reactor’s vacuum vessel (VV) during reactor operation. This dust collects in cooler regions on interior {{surfaces of the}} VV. Because this dust can be radioactive, toxic, and/or chemically reactive, it poses a safety concern, especially if mobilized by the process <b>of</b> <b>resuspension</b> during an accident and then transported as an aerosol though out the reactor confinement building, and possibly released to the environment. A computer code used at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) to model aerosol transport for safety consequence analysis is the MELCOR code. A primary reason for selecting MELCOR for this application is its aerosol transport capabilities. The INL Fusion Safety Program (FSP) organization has made fusion specific modifications to MELCOR. Recent modifications include the implementation <b>of</b> aerosol <b>resuspension</b> models in MELCOR 1. 8. 5 for Fusion. This paper presents the resuspension models adopted and the initial benchmarking of these models...|$|R
40|$|Resuspension-mediated aerobic {{release of}} P can {{be crucial to}} the {{phosphorus}} cycling of a shallow lake. The effect <b>of</b> <b>resuspension</b> on the aerobic release of phosphorus was studied in the field with experimental water columns. The study included four experiments that were conducted in May and August {{during the day and}} following night in the shallow Kirkkojärvi basin of Lake Hiidenvesi. In all the experiments, the concentrations of suspended solids (SS) and total phosphorus (TP) increased substantially, due to the 10 -min resuspension treatment. However, the concentration of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) was strongly affected only at night in August, when high pH levels promoted SRP release by ligand-exchange reactions. During the day experiment in August, no SRP release was detected, due to high assimilation by phytoplankton. The results pointed out that coupling <b>of</b> <b>resuspension</b> and high algal blooms induced pH in the water column can liberate significant amounts of soluble P into the water column. The importance of this phenomenon for the lake studied was emphasized {{by the fact that the}} P pools susceptible to pHdependent P release (Al-P and Fe-P) formed a large part of the total extractable P of the surface sediment. Additionally, the conditions of high pH are common from early July to late September and the water pH can stay at a high level also at night during strong phytoplankton blooms...|$|R
40|$|Internal solitary waves {{propagating}} horizontally in a two layer stratified fluid are studied. Laboratory {{experiments are}} carried out in order to investigate the generation of large amplitude Internal Solitary Waves (ISWs) in a wave tank through the standard lock-release method. Particular focus is paid {{to the role of}} wave breaking which is observed in the experimental campaign. The breaking of ISWs of depression shoaling upon a sloping boundary is analyzed depending on both waves properties and slopes values. Dyed vertical tracers are used and sediments are sprinkled on the slope {{in order to understand the}} effects in terms of mixing and bed material redistribution caused by the different breaking mechanisms. Following a qualitatively analysis of the different breaking mechanisms, collapsing breakers show the greater contribution in term <b>of</b> <b>resuspension</b> <b>of</b> bed material, while plunging breakers give rise to the biggest amount of mixing...|$|R
40|$|The {{trend of}} the PM 10 {{concentrations}} in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) is reviewed and relative contributions of major contributors (paved road emissions and long-range transport from outside the SMA) are discussed. It was shown that the PM 10 concentrations in the SMA have generally decreased except Incheon between 1999 and 2005. Further, it was identified that the difference of the PM 10 mass concentration between the roadside stations and urban ambient stations has decreased between 2004 and 2008. Based on the emission estimates, {{it was suggested that}} the reduction <b>of</b> <b>resuspension</b> <b>of</b> aerosols on the road is the major reason for that. Based on the modeling results, it was identified that outside effects be about 30 % of the ambient PM 10 concentration in the SMA. Further research and policy issues to identify major sources o...|$|R
40|$|Sediments of the Marano and Grado Lagoon (Adriatic Sea, Italy) {{represent}} {{one of the}} world’s {{most major}} repositories of mercury (Hg). Its presence is {{a direct consequence of}} the historical mining activity in nearby Idrjia (Slovenia), as well as significant discharges from a chlor-alkali plant into the AussaeCorno river system, which connects to the lagoon. Previous studies have shown that sediment acts as secondary source of Hg species to the overlying water column in natural conditions. However, evidence for the effects <b>of</b> <b>resuspension</b> on the dynamics of Hg species is still lacking. The work reported in this paper formed part of the multidisciplinary “MIRACLE” project, aimed at identifying areas at low risk of Hg bioaccumulation in commercial Manila Clams, {{an important part of the}} local economy in this region. The effect <b>of</b> <b>resuspension</b> on the cycling of inorganic mercury (IHg), reactive mercury (RHg) and methylmercury (MeHg) between the sediment and water columnwas investigated in a mesocosm study. Two experiments were conducted in October 2009 and September 2010 based on material collected from sites heavily impacted by Hg and periodically subjected to dredging activities. Designed to mimic the <b>resuspension</b> <b>of</b> particles, both experiments revealed that the release of Hg species from the solid to the dissolved phase became negligible quickly after the event. MeHg values did not change according to total mercury (THg), suggesting that the enhancement of methylation processes may occur. The findings reported in this paper may be useful for the local management of dredging and fishing activities, although mass balance calculations showed that the total flux of Hg species are trivial compared to lagoon-wide processes...|$|R
30|$|The {{analysis}} of transfection efficiency was performed using a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Mountain View, CA, USA). Cells were first washed with PBS and detached with 0.2 mL of 0.25 % trypsin. Growth medium was then added, and the cells suspension was centrifuged at 1, 000 rpm for 5 min. Two further cell-washing cycles <b>of</b> <b>resuspension</b> and centrifugation {{was carried out}} in PBS before fixation in 0.4 mL of 75 % ethanol. The percentage of cells expressing GFP was then determined from 10, 000 events and reported as a mean ± standard deviation (SD) of three samples.|$|R
