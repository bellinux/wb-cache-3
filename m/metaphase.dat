5|$|DNA damage {{checkpoint}} is {{a signal}} transduction pathway that blocks cell cycle progression in G1, G2 and <b>metaphase</b> and slows down {{the rate of}} S phase progression when DNA is damaged. It leads to a pause in cell cycle allowing the cell time {{to repair the damage}} before continuing to divide.|$|E
25|$|At <b>metaphase,</b> CENP-E, Bub3 and Bub1 levels {{decreases}} 3 to 4 fold {{as compared}} to the levels at unattached kinetochores, whereas the levels of dynein/dynactin, Mad1, Mad2 and BubR1 decrease >10-100 fold. Thus at <b>metaphase,</b> when all chromosomes are aligned at the <b>metaphase</b> plate, all checkpoint proteins are released from the kinetochore. The disappearance of the checkpoint proteins out of the kinetochores indicates the moment when the chromosome has reached the <b>metaphase</b> plate and is under bipolar tension. At this moment, the checkpoint proteins that bind to and inhibit Cdc20 (Mad1-Mad2 and BubR1), release Cdc20, which binds and activates APC/CCdc20, and this complex triggers sister chromatids separation and consequently anaphase entry.|$|E
25|$|Chromosomes are {{normally}} visible under a light microscope {{only when the}} cell is undergoing the <b>metaphase</b> of cell division. Before this happens, every chromosome is copied once (S phase), and the copy is joined to the original by a centromere, resulting in an X-shaped structure. The original chromosome and the copy are now called sister chromatids. During <b>metaphase</b> the X-shape structure is called a <b>metaphase</b> chromosome. In this highly condensed form chromosomes are easiest to distinguish and study. In animal cells, chromosomes reach their highest compaction level in anaphase during segregation.|$|E

40|$|Centromere-center {{distances}} {{were analyzed}} in 50 normal female and 100 normal male <b>metaphases.</b> Compared with the random distribution of all chromosomes, chromosome pair 6 {{had a significantly}} different distribution in both female and male <b>metaphases.</b> Moreover, a significant peripheral location of chromosome pairs 4 and 5 and a significant central location of chromosome pairs 13, 15, 21, and 22 were found in male <b>metaphases.</b> But no specific peripheral location could be assigned to the X or Y chromosomes. No inter-nor intraindividual differences or sex-dependent variation in centro-mere-center distances were observed. Variance analyses demonstrated consistent centromere-center distances in normal human <b>metaphases</b> obtained from individuals of the same age. The constancy of these chromosome distributions may correlate with chromosome duplication pattern, chromosome length, and chromosome structure. © 1977 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Brachyteles arachnoides (Atelinae) has 62 chromosomes and a very small Y chromosome.

However, no hybridization signal was observed in Alouatta <b>metaphases</b> (subfamily Alouattinae), a closely related genus in the Atelidae family. Furthermore, our data support a close phylogenetic relationship among Brachyteles, Ateles, and Lagothrix and their placement in the Atelinae subfamily, but exclude Alouatta from this group indicating its placement as basal to this group.

40|$|Hemopoietic {{growth factors}} are used with {{increasing}} frequency {{in the treatment of}} patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). While a response occurs regularly, it has not been unequivocally resolved whether this effect is due to the stimulation of normal hemopoiesis or to induced maturation of the abnormal clone. To determine whether selective responses to colony-stimulating factors of normal versus abnormal clones occurred, cytogenetic analysis was performed on bone marrow cells of MDS patients before and during in vivo treatment with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO). A proliferation of additional clones could be demonstrated by karyotypic analysis in one patient during GM-CSF therapy and in two patients during rhEPO treatment. Two patients, initially with completely normal cytogenetics, developed a mixture of normal and abnormal <b>metaphases</b> during treatment. Two patients, initially with all abnormal <b>metaphases,</b> developed normal <b>metaphases</b> during treatment with GM-CSF. A mosaic of normal and abnormal <b>metaphases</b> was present in six patients. The percentage of abnormal <b>metaphases</b> increased in three patients during GM-CSF treatment, and in one patient during rhEPO therapy. The cytogenetic anomalies in one patient persisted after clinical response to treatment, suggesting that GM-CSF enhanced maturation of the abnormal clone. These data indicate that cytokine therapy in MDS may have diverse effects on hematopoiesis. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Purpose]: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{optimise}} the yield of <b>metaphases</b> in mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) in vitro cultures and to study the karyotype of MSC expanded in good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions for clinical use. [Background]: MSC are being increasingly used in clinical trials for a number of diseases. Biosafety demonstration in all cases is mandatory. Unfortunately, current standard karyotyping methods fail to obtain enough number of evaluable <b>metaphases.</b> [Methods and materials]: In the present work, to optimise the yield of <b>metaphases</b> in MSC expanded in vitro, we have tested several conditions by modifying colcemid concentration (we have tested 0 · 01, 0 · 05 and 0 · 1 μg mL - 1) and exposure time (during 5, 15 and 24 h). We further applied these optimised conditions to 61 MSC expansions in GMP conditions for clinical use. [Results]: Our results show that the highest number of <b>metaphases</b> was obtained when MSC were incubated with 0 · 05 μg mL - 1 of colcemid overnight (15 h), compared to the remaining experimental conditions. In most cases (59 / 61 cases) enough number of <b>metaphases</b> was obtained. And what is more relevant, only in one case a karyotypic abnormality was found (trisomy of chromosome 10), and cells were subsequently discarded for clinical use. [Conclusion]: We describe here an optimal method to obtain enough number of <b>metaphases</b> for karyotype analysis of in vitro expanded MSCs, what is essential for their clinical use in cell therapy programmes. © 2012 The Authors.

40|$|Cytogenetic {{analysis}} is considered pivotal {{for assessing the}} remission rate in CML patients on IFN therapy. On the basis of general agreement, at least 25 <b>metaphases</b> should be analyzed in each case. The main limitations to this approach are: 1) {{the small number of}} analyzable <b>metaphases</b> generally found in cytogenetic preparations from IFN-α-treated patients; and 2) the inability of this technique for scoring interphase cells. We compared the results of cytogenetic analysis and double-color FISH detection of bcr/abl genes fusion in 13 CML patients on IFN-α therapy (marrow sampling for cytogenetic and FISH analysis was carried out after 12 months in all patients and repeated after 18 months of IFN therapy in patients 4, 6, and 8). In five specimens, 20 to 25 cells were evaluable for cytogenetic examination, in another five no analyzable <b>metaphases</b> were scored, and in the remaining six samples two to 14 cells could be analyzed. With FISH detection at least 100 cells were easily scored in each specimen (mean number, 175). Comparing the results carried out with the two methods in different samples it emerged that cytogenetic analysis led to improper conclusions as regards the rate of Ph positivity, even in those patients where 20 - 25 <b>metaphases</b> were analyzed. Although many more cases have to be studied to establish the role of FISH analysis in Ph-positive patients, we are of the opinion that cytogenetic {{analysis is}} unfit for easily and accurately assessing the actual quality of remission in IFN-treated subjects...|$|R
40|$|The {{possible}} {{influence of}} the high polymorphic C heterochromatic regions of human chromosomes 1, 9, 16, and Y on meiotic chromosome segregation was investigated.

The aim of our study was to determine whether either a variation in the amounts of total C heterochromatin or differences in the amounts of C heterochromatin between homologues could lead to faulty chromosome segregation. The study was performed on C banded <b>metaphases</b> obtained from peripheral lymphocyte cultures of 15 couples with recurrent early abortions and 15 control couples, all Caucasians. Analysis of variance was first performed on separate <b>metaphases</b> to measure intra-individual, inter-individual, and between population variation in a hierarchical model. Since the significant intra-individual differences covered the other parameters we performed, secondly, a one way analysis of variance on the mean values of <b>metaphases</b> per person in order to measure the inter-individual and between population variation.
