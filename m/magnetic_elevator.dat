5000|$|The medical {{department}} {{is sold in}} 1970 and the attention turns towards the encoders. In 1973, {{one of the first}} non-contact, optical absolute rotary encoders was developed in the FRABA offices in Cologne. Afterwards, the company expands the portfolio of the encoders, adding new mechanical designs and electrical interfaces. Furthermore, <b>magnetic</b> <b>elevator</b> switches were produced. Regrettably, due to some less fortunate decisions, FRABA misses certain changes and loses connection to newly established technologies, such as transistors.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1987 The thesis {{describes}} the preliminary studies on a laboratory {{model of a}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>elevator</b> intended {{as part of a}} system for circulating magnetic materials in chemical reactors. A multiple coil laboratory model, controlled by computer, was designed and constructed. Current measuring transducers were used to monitor system performance and study system response. Tests were performed on the model to investigate the effect of the following parameters. 1. coil spacing 2. energizing current 3. energizing time 4. particle size The thesis presents the results of the above tests and gives the design for an adaptive controller as a means of improving system performance by incorporating some closed loop control...|$|E
