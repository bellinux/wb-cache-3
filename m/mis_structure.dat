40|$|The {{signal fading}} in {{wireless}} underground sensor networks (WUSNs), {{which is caused}} by lossy media such as soil and sand, can be reduced by applying technology of magnetoinductive (MI) propagation. This technology can effectively establish a communication at very low frequency (VLF). In contrast {{to the previous studies}} in the literature, which mostly focus on the propagation of plane waves, we propose a new approach based on the plane wave expansion (PWE) to model the near field MI waves. The proposed approach is based on excitation of a point source, which is a common case in a practical WUSN. The frequent usage of square lattice <b>MI</b> <b>structure</b> is investigated. To verify the mathematical derivation, the simulation of time domain based on the fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK) method is carried out. Simulation results show that the new model can provide a precise prediction to the MI wave’s propagation, with the computation load being one-tenth of that of the time domain simulation. The characteristics of the propagation of the MI waves are presented and discussed. Finally, the reflection {{on the edge of the}} <b>MI</b> <b>structure</b> is reduced by analysing the terminal matching conditions and calculating a method for matching impedances...|$|R

Ducci and Yianneskis (2007) {{have shown}} that mixing times of {{reactors}} stirred by radial impellers can be reduced by 20 - 30 % when feed insertion {{is made in the}} vortex core of precessional flow structures, denoted as macro-instabilities (MIs). The aim of the present work is to investigate the interaction between large scale flow <b>structures,</b> such as <b>MIs</b> and trailing vortices (TV), and assess to which extent local mixing might be affected by their combined activity. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) analysis was employed to identify and characterise the two different flow structures considered. It is shown that the combined presence of the trailing vortex and <b>MI</b> <b>structures</b> in the impeller vicinity results in energy levels that are substantially enhanced and thus locations showing further promise for feed insertion and mixing enhancement may be identified...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{behavior of}} gels of various water content, normal and edematous tissues have been studied. Static deformations and vibrations at low frequencies {{were applied to}} an area {{of each of these}} structures. Softer structures, e. g., gel containing a high percentage of water and pitting edema, have lower mechanical impedance (<b>MI),</b> while harder <b>structures,</b> e. g., nonpitting edema have higher MI. A comparison of the static force measured at bilateral sites on normal subjects show lower differences in impedance than do similar comparisons made in subjects having unilateral edema. This difference is more pronounced with greater static compression. The differences in the <b>MI</b> between different <b>structures</b> are greater at the lower frequencies. At the lower frequencies up to around 30 Hz the ratio of the magnitude of MI of edematous skin and that of contralateral normal skin can indicate the degree of edema.
