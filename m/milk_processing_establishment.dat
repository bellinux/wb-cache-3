40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to make clear the {{characteristics}} of <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> system in the South-west of Bulgaria and figure out the transition history of <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> techniques in Bulgaria. It was confirmed that the Bulgarian system shares some techniques in common both with fermented <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> series and with the solidifying-additives using series. It was considered highly possible that the fermented <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> series seen in Bulgaria today originated from West Asia. Meanwhile，it was found that some significant differences from the West Asian fermented <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> series are the Bulgarian one stops at the stage of making fermented milk and butter，without further processing those into cheese and butter oil. This change can be explained with the cool temperate weather environment in the Balkan Peninsula which allows for the conservation of milk products with relatively high water conten. We also considered that the Bulgarian cheese processing techniques which use the method of brine maturation hold an intermediate position between the West Asian cheese production techniques where no maturation methods are used and the European cheese production techniques which are specialized in cheese maturation. Therefore，it was considered proper to conclude that the Bulgarian cheese processing techniques formed the basis of the European cheese processing. Furthermore，since the rennet was initially used for curdling raw milk and butter-churning，and was later applied to cheese making in the Balkan Peninsula，this geographical region can be nominated as the cradle of cheese made by rennet additives. In this sense，the tradition of <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> in Bulgaria today keeps some very old techniques which are important from the view point of the human <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> history. However，many of these traditions have been threatened under the influence of the socialism system，as well as under its collapse and recent EU accession. The ability of Bulgaria to protect its agricultural system and its culture is now being put to the test. 本稿では，ブルガリア南西部の乳加工体系とその特徴 を明らかにし，バルカン半島のブルガリアにおける乳加 工発達史を論考した。ブルガリアの乳加工体系は，発酵 乳系列群と凝固剤使用系列群の乳加工技術が確認され た。ブルガリアの発酵乳系列群は西アジア由来の乳加工 技術である可能性が極めて高く，冷涼性ゆえに水分含量 が比較的高くても保存が可能なため，酸乳やバターの段 階で加工が終了してしまうように変遷していた。塩水漬 けにしてチーズの熟成をおこなうバルカン半島ブルガリ アのチーズ加工技術は，熟成をおこなわない西アジアと 熟成に特化したヨーロッパのちょうど中間的な位置にあ り，ヨーロッパのチーズ加工の土台を形成した可能性が 高いと考えられた。更に，レンネット利用がチーズ加工 にではなくチャーニングによるバター加工用の生乳凝固 に利用されていることから，もともとのレンネット利用 は先ずバター加工に用いられ，後にバター加工からチーズ加工へと転用されていった可能性が高いと考えられた。これらのことから，レンネット利用によるチーズ加工の起原地の一候補地がバルカン半島であることが示唆された。このように、ブルガリア乳文化は人類の乳加工史において極めて重要な乳加工技術を今日に伝えている。これらのブルガリアの重要な乳加工技術も、社会主義体制への移行・崩壊，EUという巨大経済圏に加盟したまさに今、自国の農業生産や文化の継承のあり方について問われている。[URL]...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to provide an empirical analysis of potential market power of the Ukrainian <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> industry in the market for raw milk. The article is based on the New Empirical Industrial Organization (NEIO) approach and pays special attention to the production technology of the sector. In NEIO studies of market power in the food processing industry the production technology is typically assumed to be of a neoclassical type with simple properties like, e. g., constant returns to scale. Properties of this kind, however, are likely not to prevail in most transition countries of Eastern Europe because of serious distortions in factor usage mainly due to institutional deficiencies. Therefore, the analysis of this study is based on the more general representation of the production technology by a translog production function. The econometric model used to measure the degree of oligopsony power of the Ukrainian <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> industry is estimated on the basis of monthly data. The model did not produce any evidence suggesting the exercise of market power by the <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> industry in the estimation period from January 1996 to December 2003. This empirical result is consistent with the low operating rate of the Ukrainian <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> industry and relatively small concentration ratio at the national level.

40|$|Transition {{from the}} planned {{to the market}} economy {{involved}} profound changes in Ukrainian economy. Before the liberalization of prices in 1992, <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> in Ukraine was concentrated in regionally distributed large state <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> factories. In the meantime, the dairy sector has been privatized. However, the emerging privatization forms were heterogeneous. That is why different kinds of market conduct and, consequently, market performance can be expected, depending on ownership and incentive structures involved. Particular macroeconomic conditions have led to agricultural farms and <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> factories dragging in conformation to the new situation. The necessary economic reorganization has caused a considerable decrease in milk production. Therefore, the capacity utilization of <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> industry in the 1990 s has strongly diminished. Due to this reason, the increase in average production costs has lowered the sectoral profitability to a significant extent. Although {{at the beginning of}} the market-oriented transformation changes and uncertainties of this nature were to a large extent similar for agricultural and food sectors in different Central and Eastern European countries, so far only little is known about market conduct of <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> enterprises. The descriptive analysis provides evidence of limited market transparency and an influence of regional administrative authorities on regional trade with raw milk via trade restrictions. In such conditions <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> enterprises were able to gain a regional monopsony or oligopsony position on the raw milk market, and, hence, there is reason to presume that they exercise market power on that market. In addition, in 2002 the Antimonopoly Committee of Ukraine detected price cartels among <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> enterprises in some administrative regions of Ukraine. This may be interpreted as a prerequisite for the exercise of market power on the part of <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> industry. On the other hand, because of low concentration of <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> industry at the national level, the assumption about competition cannot completely be dismissed. Moreover, the low capacity utilization of <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> industry and, consequently, the competition for raw milk stand against the hypothesis about existence of market power. Since the 1980 s, in studies analyzing imperfect competition on agricultural and food markets, quantitative approaches have increasingly been based on microeconomic theory and on concepts of New Empirical Industrial Organization (NEIO). The NEIO approach was applied in numerous studies on market structure and pricing on agricultural and food markets. The applications, however, have more or less been limited to developed market economies such as the USA, Canada and others. On the other hand, due to the transition from a planned to a market economy, in countries such as Ukraine, there is also reason to expect market conditions on agricultural and food markets which considerably deviate from the model of perfect competition. For the analysis of the market structure and pricing on the Ukrainian raw milk market, a comparative static structural model has been built. The model consists of a short-run supply function for raw milk on one side and of the first order condition for profit maximization for the raw milk demand of <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> enterprises on the other side. An important advantage of the market structural model is that the existence of market power can be explicitly tested. For econometric analyses, aggregate industrial (market) data at both, national and regional level as well as data at the level of the individual firm can be used. Before the specification and estimation of the market structural model, as a first step the production technology of the <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> industry and the raw milk supply in Ukraine have been econometrically investigated. The results of the econometric analysis of production and supply functions were used to analyze the market structural model. Different special cases of the production function for the Ukrainian <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> industry were econometrically estimated based on the transcendental logarithmic (translog) functional form showing differences both, in the scale elasticity and in the rate of technological progress. The estimated scale elasticity in the special case of a Cobb-Douglas production function is statistically significant and amounts to 1, 4. Due to this result, there is evidence of increasing returns to scale in Ukrainian <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> industry. Results considerably diverging from the Cobb-Douglas case are obtained from the estimation of production elasticities based on a non-restricted translog production function. Negative production elasticities are obtained for the production factors labor and capital. This can be associated with under-utilization of capacities of Ukrainian <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> plants. Furthermore, the results have to be interpreted against the background of the change of social and institutional basic conditions in Ukraine. Therefore, the results obtained from estimating the neoclassical Cobb-Douglas production function, have to be interpreted carefully. Consequently, with regard to the market structural model for the Ukrainian raw milk market, it seems to be problematic to specify the production technology of the <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> industry as a neoclassical production function. This can be attributed to the specific situation in the industry during the transformation process. Hence, the non-restricted translog production function has been used within the scope of the market structural model. In numerous studies, the estimation results for agricultural supply functions were presented. The functions have been estimated on the basis of either single equation models or multiple equation models as a part of a complete system of supply and factor demand functions for the agricultural sector. However, in most cases, the modeling was carried out for both, single equation models and multiple equation models, assuming perfect competition. With regard to the modeling of the market structural model, some aspects and problems about derivation of supply functions from a variable profit function are discussed, and an overview about empirical supply and factor demand functions in the NEIO-studies is given. Afterwards estimation results for several versions of the supply function for raw milk of the Ukrainian agricultural sector are discussed. The main objective of the econometric analysis, however is to measure the market power of <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> enterprises on the Ukrainian raw milk market, within the analytical framework of a market structure model which is based on the theoretical concepts of NEIO. The model serves to estimate a market power parameter and to test econometrically for the existence of market power. It is specified taking into account the estimation results for the production function of the <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> industry and the supply function for raw milk. The results of the econometric estimation of the model do not show evidence of the exercise of market power by Ukrainian <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> industry over the sample period from January 1996 to December 2003. Since aggregate data on the national level is used in the estimation, the results relate only to the overall raw milk market in Ukraine. In terms of market structure of Ukrainian <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> industry at the national level the results are somewhat plausible because the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (for 2001) is 7, which is relatively small compared with other countries. Moreover, the results of the descriptive part of the work show that the market structure in the Ukrainian <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> industry has not changed over the sample period. However, it is necessary to note, that the available industry data at the national level are too highly aggregated for a final decision about the existence of market power. Considering the structure of the <b>milk</b> <b>processing</b> industry on the regional markets and also the basic conditions on the market for raw milk, the existence of market power cannot be excluded. The descriptive analysis shows that in 8 of 25 regions the Herfindahl-Hirschman index is larger than 200. For a determination of the relevant market boundaries the regional market for raw milk seems to be of prime importance for the analysis. Therefore, in order to make final statements about the existence of market power in future studies disaggregated industry data should be used for the estimation of market structural models at the regional level. ...|$|R

The main focus was to describe and characterize different value chain actors, functions and services providers along the dairy value chain, to quantify the economic contribution of dairy value chain to actors and to investigate factors of small holder farmer’s participation in dairy value chain. To accomplish these tasks formal and informal data collection tools for both primary and secondary data. A total of eighty smallholder dairy farmers from Laelay Maychew and eighty smallholder dairy farmers from Adwa district were selected at random and were interviewed using structured questionnaire. Milk and butter {{were the most important}} dairy products marketed in the areas. Dairy producers and retailers (café and restaurants) are found to be important milk market chain actors in the study area. From the milk value chain actors, 66. 5 % of retailers (café and restaurants) and 33. 5 % of milk producers added a value to the milk. In milk market, milk retailers enjoyed the highest net profit. The econometric estimation procedure was employed to identify factors that determine milk market participation decision and milk sale volume of the farm household in the area. The logistic regression results showed that educational level, cross breed type, access to credit and access to extension service are significantly affecting milk market participation decision. Similarly estimation results of second stage Heckman selection model showed that breed type and total milk product were significantly affecting volume of milk supply. The major constraints of dairy production and marketing in the studied areas were inadequate availability and supply of feed, low volume of milk, lack of training access, low house hold income/low purchasing power, unavailability of cooling facilities for milk storing, distance to market, low market demand of the product, low breed performance, access to transport, land access, access to water. Dairy product value chain in the study area seemed to be ineffective and underdeveloped. Thus, dairy development interventions should be aimed at addressing both dairy production technological gaps and marketing problems.
