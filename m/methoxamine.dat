The PD 20 (the dose of <b>methoxamine</b> causing a 20 % fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV 1]) ranged from 0. 3 - 18 mumol. Ipratropium bromide (200 micrograms administered by aerosol) significantly inhibited (P less than 0. 05) the response to <b>methoxamine</b> in all patients without producing {{significant changes in the}} mean baseline lung function. The mean PD 20 for <b>methoxamine</b> after saline was 6. 8 mumol and 95 % confidence limits (CL) were 3. 6, 12. 7 mumol. The mean PD 20 for <b>methoxamine</b> after ipratropium bromide was 35. 4 (95 % CL 28. 8, 43. 6) mumol.

40|$|Inactivation of {{glycogen}} synthase by <b>methoxamine</b> {{was not associated}} with changes in cyclic AMP and was abolished by the alpha adrenergic antagonists phentolamine, phenoxybenzamine, and dihydroergotamine. The effect of <b>methoxamine</b> was not reversed by atropine or the beta adrenergic antagonists propranolol or practolol. <b>Methoxamine</b> decreased the percentage of {{glycogen synthase}} I activity that had been increased by incubating cells with 100 microunits/ml insulin; however, an effect of insulin was observed at the highest concentration of <b>methoxamine</b> tested (100 tM). The effect of 10 iM <b>methoxamine</b> was not overcome by 25 mihiunits/mI of insulin. The inactivation of glycogen synthase by <b>methoxamine</b> was abolished by incubating cells in calcium-free medium containing 1 mri EGTA, and the effect of <b>methoxamine</b> was restored by adding calcium. Incubation of cells with the divalent cation ionophore A 23187 decreased the percentage of glycogen synthase I activity in the presence of, but not the absence of calcium. When A 23187 and <b>methoxamine</b> were added together, no further decrease in the percentage of glycogen synthase I activity was observed below that produced by either agent alone. The activation of glycogen synthase by insulin was not diminished by incubating cells in calcium-free medium plus 1 m EGTA. An effect of insulin on glycogen synthase was observed even in the presence of A 23187. The results indicate that the increase in the percentage of glycogen synthase I activity due to insulin is independent of extracellular calcium. Alpha adrenergic receptor stimulation may lead to a decrease in the percentage of glycogen synthase I activity by increasing the concentration of cytosolic calcium.

40|$|In {{thoracic}} aortic strips with intact endothelium, {{the first}} and second (1 [*]h later) dose-response curves obtained with <b>methoxamine</b> were almost the same. <b>Methoxamine</b> caused a dose-dependent increase in perfusion pressure in the rat isolated mesenteric arterial bed, but the second (1 [*]h later) dose-response curve for <b>methoxamine</b> showed a significant attenuation of the response in comparison with the first. The attenuation shown by the second dose-response curve for <b>methoxamine</b> was significantly reduced, but not abolished, in mesenteric arterial beds without endothelium. Incubating endothelium-intact mesenteric arterial beds with NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG) caused a significant, but not complete, reversal of the attenuation shown in the second dose-response curve. Incubating the mesenteric arterial bed with capsaicin, tetrodotoxin, indomethacin or with isotonic high k+ (60 [*]mM) plus nicardipine did not affect the above attenuation seen in the second dose-response curve. The guanosine 3 ′: 5 ′-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic GMP) level in the effluent from the perfused mesenteric arterial bed was significantly increased after the second exposure to <b>methoxamine.</b> This effect was significantly smaller after removal of the endothelium or pretreatment with L-NOARG.

40|$|Several {{pieces of}} {{evidence}} suggest that the noradrenergic afferents in the medial preoptic area produce sleep and hypothermia by acting on l adrenergic receptors. On the other hand, in a few studies monitoring body temperature with a rectal probe, preoptic injection of the l adrenergic agonist <b>methoxamine</b> produced contradictory changes in body temperature and sleep-wakefulness. Such contradictions call for the re-examination of <b>methoxamine</b> induced body temperature changes using a better technique like telemetric recording. In the present study, we monitored body temperature and sleep-wakefulness simultaneously after the micro-injection of 0. 5, 1, and 2 tmol <b>methoxamine,</b> into the medial preoptic area of adult male Wistar rats. <b>Methoxamine</b> injection produced hypothermia but no major change in sleep-wakefulness during the 3 hours after drug injection, except {{for a short period}} (15 min) of sleep after 120 min of injection.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether pre-treatment of human skin with the α 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist terazosin would block vasoconstrictor responses and axon-reflex vasodilatation to the α 1 -adrenoceptor agonist <b>methoxamine.</b> Drugs were administered by iontophoresis into the skin of the forearm of 15 healthy participants, and skin blood flow was monitored with a laser Doppler flow probe at the site of <b>methoxamine</b> iontophoresis (to monitor direct vasoconstrictor responses) or 5 – 10 mm from the site of <b>methoxamine</b> iontophoresis (to monitor axon-reflex vasodilatation). Experimental sites were pre-treated with terazosin (administered by iontophoresis for 10 min at 200 µA), and the same current intensity was passed through 0. 9 % saline to control for the nonspecific effects of iontophoresis. Pre-treatment with terazosin blocked vasoconstrictor responses to increasing doses of <b>methoxamine,</b> and also blocked vasodilatation several mm from the site of terazosin and <b>methoxamine</b> administration.

Currently, its clinical use is limited to correction of hypotensive crises during anaesthesia and surgical shock. A single injection of <b>methoxamine</b> will produce hypertension and marked medial arterial necrosis in animals. In this connection, we subjected arteriosclerotic and non-arteriosclerotic animals to a single injection of <b>methoxamine</b> and sacrificed the animals 4 hours, 2, 5 and 7 days later {{in order to determine}} whether the arteriosclerotic animals would differ from the non-arteriosclerotic animals in their response to the medial necrosis inducing effects of <b>methoxamine.</b> Within minutes after injection, the animals became prostrate, developed congestive heart failure and mortality was high. Myocardial infarction, adrenocortical haemorrhage and thymic, involution, intestinal gangrene as well as splenic, renal and testicular thrombosis and infarction were prevalent. Serum CPK, SGOT, glucose, triglyceride, free fatty acids, cholesterol, BUN and corticosterone manifested dynamic increases but the pattern of response was quite different in the arteriosclerotic vs. non-arteriosclerotic animals. Although extensive medial necrosis was produced in the medium-sized arteries of animals with previously normal arteries, the damage was promptly repaired; the animals with pre-existing arteriosclerosis were not affected by the pressor effects of <b>methoxamine.</b> The induction of myocardial infarction, and extensive thrombosis and infarction are ascribed to the bradycardia-inducing effects of <b>methoxamine</b> and the medial necrosis-inducing effects are ascribed to its intense vasopressor activity...|$|E

However, fresh medium did not counteract the negative inotropic effect of <b>methoxamine.</b> Accordingly, the negative inotropic effect of <b>methoxamine</b> is not directly related to the impaired phospholipase C responses seen in atria subjected to electrolysis. Ouabain (10 [*]μM) and the protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C (50 [*]nM), completely prevented the negative inotropic effect of 300 [*]μM <b>methoxamine</b> in electrolysis-treated atria. Measurement of the Na+/K+ ATPase activity, revealed that in control atria, α 1 -adrenoceptor stimulation with 300 [*]μM <b>methoxamine,</b> decreased the Na+/K+ ATPase activity by 14. 4 ± 7. 7 %.

The a-AR agonist <b>methoxamine</b> either had no effect or had a slight inhibitory effect on basal ICa-L in the absence and presence of hypoxia. Hypoxia significantly decreased the K 0. 5 for activation of ICa-L by norepinephrine from 79. 866. 6 to 13. 360. 7 nmol/L. To determine whether hypoxia specifically altered the sensitivity of the channel to a-AR stimulation, cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of <b>methoxamine</b> in the presence of 100 nmol/L isoproterenol (Iso). In the absence of hypoxia, <b>methoxamine</b> inhibited the Iso-activated ICa-L in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC 50 of 86. 969. 9 mmol/L. However, in the presence of hypoxia, the EC 50 for inhibition of ICa-L by <b>methoxamine</b> was significantly increased to 266. 7610. 8 mmol/L. <b>Methoxamine</b> had little effect on ICa-L activated by forskolin or histamine in the absence or presence of hypoxia.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the hypothesis that tyrosine kinase activity contributes to α 1 -adrenergic inhibition of β-adrenergic responses in cardiac myocytes. We addressed this question by studying the pharmacological regulation of the L-type Ca 2 + current in acutely isolated adult guinea-pig ventricular myocytes using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The selective α 1 -adrenergic receptor agonist <b>methoxamine</b> had no effect on the basal L-type Ca 2 + current. <b>Methoxamine</b> also had no effect on cAMP-dependent stimulation of the Ca 2 + current mediated by H 2 histamine receptor activation. However, <b>methoxamine</b> did inhibit cAMP-dependent stimulation of the Ca 2 + current mediated by β-adrenergic receptor activation. The ability of <b>methoxamine</b> to inhibit β-adrenergic regulation of the Ca 2 + current was significantly antagonized by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and lavendustin A. The inhibitory effect of <b>methoxamine</b> was also mimicked by the phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate (PVN). PVN had no effect on basal Ca 2 + current or Ca 2 + current stimulated by histamine, but it did inhibit Ca 2 + current stimulated by β-adrenergic receptor activation. Furthermore, the ability of PVN to inhibit β-adrenergic stimulation of the Ca 2 + current was antagonized by lavendustin A. These results are consistent with the conclusion that in guinea-pig ventricular myocytes α-adrenergic inhibition of β-adrenergic responses involves a tyrosine kinase-dependent signalling pathway. The fact that <b>methoxamine</b> and PVN antagonized cAMP-dependent responses mediated by β-adrenergic, but not H 2 histamine, receptor activation suggests that the inhibitory effect of α-adrenergic stimulation and tyrosine kinase activity is at the level of the β-adrenergic receptor...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{end-systolic}} pressure-volume relation {{is employed}} to evaluate left ventricular contractility. In clinical studies, pharmacologic vasoconstriction {{is used to}} increase left ventricular systolic pressure to assess pressure-volume relations. However, the effect of vasoconstrictors on the ventricular contractile state is not well characterized. The effects of <b>methoxamine</b> and phenylephrine on systemic arterial pressure and left ventricular contractility in rabbits were studied with three protocols. In protocol 1, anesthetized rabbits (n = 10) were injected with incremental doses of <b>methoxamine</b> and phenylephrine intravenously. <b>Methoxamine</b> (4 mg) increased the mean arterial pressure by 50 ± 12 % (mean + SE) (n = 5, p = 0. 001). Phenylephrine (0. 2 mg) increased mean arterial pressure by 82 ± 14 % (n = 5, p = 0. 004). In protocol 2, isolated blood-perfused hearts were injected with incremental doses of these drugs in the ascending aorta in amounts approximately equal to the concentrations injected in the intact rabbits. <b>Methoxamine</b> (2 mg) reduced isovolumic peak systolic left ventricular pressure by 43 ± 9 % (n = 7, p = 0. 003), whereas phenylephrine (0. 1 mg) increased the isovolumic pressure by 24 ± 9 % (n = 7, p < 0. 05). These responses indicated an enhanced contractile state with phenylephrine and a reduced contractile state with <b>methoxamine.</b> Pretreatment with propranolol blunted the effect of phenylephrine on isovolumic pressure (n = 6, p < 0. 02). In protocol 3, cross-circulation experiments allowed study {{of the effect of}} these drugs on isovolumic left ventricular pressure in the isolated heart and simultaneously on the systemic arterial pressure in the intact anesthetized rabbit (support rabbit). <b>Methoxamine</b> decreased isovolumic left ventricular pressure at infusion rates that increased mean arterial pressure in the support rabbit. With phenylephrine, both the left ventricular isovolumic pressure and the mean arterial pressure increased. Thus, in the isolated supported heart, phenylephrine increased left ventricular contractility at doses that produced peripheral vasoconstriction in the intact rabbit. Conversely, <b>methoxamine</b> reduced ventricular contractility in the isolated heart at doses that produced peripheral vasoconstriction in the intact rabbit. The isolated hearts had variable susceptibility to the depressant effect of <b>methoxamine.</b> These results demonstrated the allowable range for valid results and the limitations of using pharmacologic vasoconstricting agents to manipulate arterial pressure afterload when assessing left ventricular contractility in this model and possibly in humans...|$|E

40|$|A recent {{proposal}} {{is that the}} alpha₁-adrenoceptor may mediate the arrhythmogenic effect of catecholamines during acute myocardial ischaernia. The purpose of this thesis was to explore the role of alpha₁ and alpha₂-adrenoceptor stimulation on vulnerability to ventricular fibrillation in the norrnoxic rat ventricular myocardium and further to evaluate the possible underlying cellular mechanism. The model used was the isolated perfused rat heart (Langendorff technique) in which ventricular fibrillation was electrically induced. The amount of current required to produce ventricular fibrillation was measured as the ventricular fibrillation threshold. Alpha₁-adrenoceptor stirnμlation with <b>methoxamine</b> to 10 ⁻⁶M to 10 ⁻⁵M increased the vulnerability to ventricular fibrillation. The arrhythmogenic effect of <b>methoxamine</b> could not be attributed to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation as it occurred {{in the setting of}} the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist agent, atenolol; furthermore no accumulation of cyclic AMP, the proposed arrhythmogenic second messenger of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation, occurred. Similarly no alteration in heart rate, coronary flow rate or myocardial high energy phosphate content accompanied the arrhythrnogenic effect of <b>methoxamine.</b> The QT interval increased with alpha₁-adrenoceptor stimulation, this being an indirect index of prolongation of the action potential duration. The arrhythmogenic action of <b>methoxamine</b> was associated with a positive inotropic effect. Prazosin 10 ⁻⁸M (an alpha₁-adrenoceptor antagonist agent) produced a tenfold displacement {{to the right of the}} log concentration response curve of the positive inotropic effect of <b>methoxamine.</b> Prazosin 10 ⁻⁸M prevented the <b>methoxamine</b> induced fall in ventricular fibrillation threshold. Alpha₂-adrenoceptor stimulation with B-HT 920 and B-HT 933 (azepexole), in the presence of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist agent atenolol, did not alter the vulnerability to ventricular fibrillation. Alpha₂-adrenoceptor stimulation produced no alteration in heart rate, coronary flow rate or metabolic status. We next explored the possible mechanism underlying the arrhythmogenic effect of <b>methoxamine.</b> Alpha₁-adrenoceptor stimulation enhances transsarcolemmal calcium ion influx and may induce sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release. To assess the role of transsarcolemmal calcium movement in alpha₁-adrenoceptor mediated effects experiments were undertaken with nisoldipine and low extracellular calcium. To evaluate the role of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release, experiments were undertaken with ryanodine (an agent reputed to inhibit sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release without effecting the slow inward current). Nisoldipine 10 ⁻⁸M, reducing extracellular calcium (2. 5 mM to 1. 25 mM) and ryanodine 10 ⁻⁹M to 10 ⁻⁸M, prevented the arrhythmogenic and positive inotropic effect of <b>methoxamine.</b> Heart rate, metabolic status and cyclic AMP levels we're unchanged with these procedures. The mechanism underlying the arrhythmogenic action of alpha₁-adrenoceptor stimulation might be an increase in cytosolic calcium concentration.

The present study was designed to evaluate whether 1) the inotropic effect is dependent on extracellular Ca 2 +-concentration, 2) the inotropic effect is combined with a positive lusitropic effect, 3) there is an indication for a Ca 2 +-sensitizing effect, 4) the cardiac effect of <b>methoxamine</b> is influenced by hypothermia. The experiments were performed in isolated working rat and guinea-pig hearts. Intraventricular pressure was measured by a catheter-tip-manometer which which was introduced into the left ventricle with a steel needle. In isolated working rat hearts rising concentrations of <b>methoxamine</b> up to 4 * 10 - 5 M resulted in an increase of LVdP/dtmax by 47 % (1, 25 mM Ca 2 +), 18 % (2, 5 mM Ca 2 +), 11 % (8, 75 mM Ca 2 +) and a decrease of 6 % (10 mM Ca 2 +). Higher concentrations of <b>methoxamine</b> regularly resulted in a fall of LVdP/dtmax. A negative inotropic effect (- 13 %) was also observed after prazosin (alpha 1 -antagonist) and in guinea pig hearts (- 50 %). The myocardial oxygen consumption more or less paralelled the inotropic effect. <b>Methoxamine</b> exhibits a weak positive lusitropic effect in individual hearts at 37 °C without statistical significance. No effect was seen after prazosin and in guinea pig hearts. At 31 °C the positive inotropic effect was fully preserved, in addition there was a significant lusitropic effect. Coronary flow decreased at all states by only 10 to 20 %, while the coronary venous PO 2 fell by 25 to 54 %. Heart rate decreased generally by 10 to 20 %, but increased at 10 mM Ca 2 + and in individual hearts with low basic rate. Conclusion: The positive inotropic effect of <b>methoxamine</b> is dependent on extracellular Ca 2 + concentration and is reversed at higher concentrations of <b>methoxamine.</b> The negative inotropic effect seems to be unspecific. A weak positive lusitropic effect of <b>methoxamine</b> is seen in individual hearts at 2. 5 and 1. 25 mM Ca 2 + but not in the averaged values. A marked lusitropic effect is observed at 31 °C. There are no indications for a Ca 2 +-sensitizing effect. The coronary constrictive effect is quite weak in rat hearts and similar after prazosin and in guinea-pig hearts. Heart rate generally decreases, but increases at low basic rate (i. g. at 10 mM Ca 2 +), except for the low rate induced by hypothermia...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the interaction of}} neuropeptide Y (NPY) with the alpha 1 -adrenoceptor agonist, <b>methoxamine,</b> in control of mean arterial pressure, renovascular resistance and mesenteric vascular resistance in anaesthetized rats. Infusion of 3. 0 but not 0. 3 microgram/kg/min NPY enhanced the elevations of all three haemodynamic parameters caused by bolus injections of <b>methoxamine</b> (10 - 100 micrograms/kg). These enhancements largely involved a prolongation of the <b>methoxamine</b> effects. While infusion of the Y 1 NPY receptor-selective antagonist, BIBP 3226 (10 micrograms/kg/min), alone did not alter methoxamine-induced vasoconstriction, it inhibited the potentiation by NPY. We conclude that NPY can potentiate methoxamine-induced vasoconstriction in vivo. This is mediated predominantly, if not exclusively, via the Y 1 receptor. Endogenously released NPY {{does not appear to}} reach sufficient concentrations to cause tonic systemic vasoconstriction or potentiation thereof in the anaesthetized ra...|$|E
40|$|Opioid {{peptides}} {{are well}} established as potent inhibitors of the pituitary-adrenal axis, while alpha 1 -adrenoceptor drugs {{have recently been}} shown to stimulate this axis: both classes of agents appear to work principally above {{the level of the}} pituitary, most probable directly on the hypothalamus. There is also evidence that these drugs interact in their control of pituitary-adrenal function, although the specific hypothalamic releasing hormone involved has remained unclear. We have therefore carried out a study into the interaction of <b>methoxamine,</b> an alpha 1 -adrenoceptor agonist and naloxone, an opioid antagonist, together with human corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), in a group of healthy volunteers in order to establish the mode of action of these drugs. The following drugs were administered to a group of seven healthy male subjects in a randomized double-blind manner: <b>methoxamine</b> (6 micrograms/kg per min over 3 h); naloxone (10 mg bolus); human CRH (100 micrograms bolus); <b>methoxamine</b> plus CRH; naloxone plus CRH; <b>methoxamine</b> plus naloxone; saline (control). Plasma ACTH and serum cortisol were measured at intervals in each subject, and blood pressure and pulse rate recorded with each sample. Both CRH and naloxone produce a marked rise in ACTH and cortisol, peaking at approximately 45 min after infusion. In combination, the drugs produced a peak response in plasma ACTH at the same time, but its magnitude was greater than that after either drug alone. <b>Methoxamine</b> produced a rise in plasma ACTH which was maximal at approximately 75 min, as well as a peak rise in serum cortisol at 120 min.

40|$|Cholinergic basal {{forebrain}} structures are implicated in cortical arousal and {{regulation of the}} sleep-wake cycle. Cholinergic neurones are innervated by noradrenergic terminals, noradrenaline excites them via alpha- 1 receptors and microinjection of noradrenaline into the {{basal forebrain}} enhances wakefulness. However, {{it is not known}} to what extent the cholinergic versus non-cholinergic basal forebrain projection neurones contribute to the arousing effects of noradrenaline. To elucidate the roles of cholinergic basal forebrain structures we administered <b>methoxamine,</b> an alpha- 1 -adrenergic agonist into the basal forebrain, in intact animals and again after selective destruction of the basal forebrain cholinergic cells by 192 IgG-saporin. In eight male Han-Wistar rats implanted with electroencephalogram/electromyogram electrodes, a microdialysis probe targeted into the basal forebrain was perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid for 6 h on a baseline day, and with cerebrospinal fluid in the first and with <b>methoxamine</b> in the second 3 -h period of the subsequent day. The sleep-wake activity was recorded for 24 h on both days. Saporin was then injected into the basal forebrain and 2 weeks later the same experimental schedule (with cerebrospinal fluid and <b>methoxamine)</b> was repeated. In the intact animals, <b>methoxamine</b> exhibited a robust arousing effect and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and REM sleep was suppressed. Lesioning of the basal forebrain cholinergic neurones abolished almost completely the NREM sleep-suppressing effect of <b>methoxamine,</b> whereas the REM sleep-suppressing effect remained intact. Thus, the basal forebrain cholinergic neurones mediate, at least in part, cortical arousal and non-REM sleep-suppression, but they are not involved in the REM sleep-suppressing effects of noradrenaline...|$|E

Heart rate (HR) and systemic arterial pressure (AP) were measured using automated osci/lotonometry and cardiac output was measured using continuous wave suprasternal Doppler ultrasonography. After lumbar extradural anaesthesia (LEA) there were no sig-nificant differences in arterial pressure between treatments, although cardiac index was significantly greater after fluid preloading (mean 4. 3 (95 % confidence interval 3. 7 - 4. 9) litre min' 1 m~ 2) than after ephedrine (3. 1 (2. 6 - 3. 6) litre min~ 1 m~ 2) or <b>methoxamine</b> (2. 6 (2. 0 - 3. 2) litre min- 1 m~ 2).

40|$|We studied {{isolated}} canine {{arteries and}} veins {{to compare the}} pharmacological properties of their postjunctional alpha-adrenoceptors. Rings of femoral and splenic arteries and of femoral and saphenous veins were mounted for isometric tension recording in organ chambers filled with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution. The four blood vessels contracted when exposed to <b>methoxamine,</b> norepinephrine, phenylephrine, and tramazoline; clonidine failed to induce contraction only in the splenic artery. The relative sensitivity to <b>methoxamine</b> was comparable in the arteries and veins, but that for phenylephrine was larger in the former. The veins, but not the arteries, were more sensitive to clonidine and tramazoline than to phenylephrine or <b>methoxamine.</b> Phentolamine was a competitive antagonist against norepinephrine in the arteries and the veins. Prazosin was a competitive antagonist only in the arteries. The competitive antagonistic properties of yohimbine were more pronounced in the veins than in the arteries. Verapamil depressed {{to the same extent}} the contractile responses of saphenous veins to clonidine and norepinephrine, but reduced the contractions caused by <b>methoxamine</b> more than those due to norepinephrine.

40|$|In {{an initial}} {{series of studies}} in pithed {{normotensive}} rats, nitrendipine (3, 10, 30 micrograms/kg/min X 15 min) preferentially antagonized the pressor responses to BHT 920, a selective alpha 2 -adrenergic agonist, while hardly interfering with responses to <b>methoxamine,</b> a selective alpha 1 -agonist. The preferential alpha 2 -antagonism by nitrendipine (0. 01 - 0. 3 mg/kg i. v.) was also shown by its greater antagonism of pressor responses to norepinephrine in propranolol (1 mg/kg) -prazosin (0. 3 mg/kg i. v.) -pretreated pithed rats (alpha 1 -receptors blocked, alpha 2 exposed) than in propranolol-yohimbine (0. 3 mg/kg) -pretreated preparations (alpha 2 blocked, alpha 1 exposed). However, the effect of nitrendipine on vascular alpha 2 -adrenergic responsiveness {{was found to be}} not specific for calcium entry blockers (CaEB) since vasodilators without calcium entry blocking properties [sodium nitroprusside (3 - 30 mg/kg/min X 15 min) and hydralazine (0. 03 - 3. 0 mg/kg/min X 15) ], gave the same pattern of interference with pressor responses to <b>methoxamine</b> and BHT 920 in exactly the same model. Both vasodilators depressed the pressor dose-response curves to BHT 920, while sparing those to <b>methoxamine.</b> Thus, calcium entry blockade preferentially antagonized alpha 2 -mediated vasoconstriction, but this effect was common to other non-CaEB vasodilators. The reason for the relative sparing by CaEB of pressor responses to alpha 1 -adrenergic stimulation was sought in a second series of studies of dose-response curves to <b>methoxamine</b> following partial alpha-adrenoceptor inactivation by phenoxybenzamine (0. 3 mg/kg i. v.). In these conditions, nitrendipine (30 micrograms/kg/min), sodium nitroprusside (30 micrograms/kg/min), and hydralazine (3 mg/kg/min) all strongly depressed the pressor responses to <b>methoxamine.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|The alpha-adrenoceptor {{populations in}} aortic strips from humans, rats, guinea-pigs and rabbits were {{investigated}} in vitro, using specific agonists and antagonists. In rabbit and human preparations {{the activities of}} the two agonists tested, noradrenaline and <b>methoxamine,</b> were competitively antagonized by prazosin, whereas in the other animal species prazosin showed a competitive antagonism for <b>methoxamine</b> induced contraction, but an uncompetitive behaviour against noradrenaline. The alpha 2 -selective agonists B-HT 920 and detomidine did not elicit any effect on aortic strips up to 10 (- 3) M. On the basis of these results, alpha 1 -receptors seem to represent an homogeneous population in human and rabbit aortae, but not in rat and guinea-pig tissues. On the other hand, the contractile response of noradrenaline and <b>methoxamine</b> on aortic strips from the four animal species examined cannot be ascribed to the activation of postsynaptic alpha 2 -receptors.

40|$|To {{confirm the}} {{presence}} of alpha 2 -mediated vasoconstriction in human vasculature, the effect of selective alpha 1 - and alpha 2 -agonists (<b>methoxamine</b> and B-HT 933) and antagonists (indoramin and Yohimbine) was studied in fourteen patients with mild, uncomplicated, essential hypertension. Drugs were infused, into the brachial artery at systemically ineffective rates, and concomitant changes in forearm blood flow were measured by strain gauge venous plethysmography. During control conditions, cumulative infusions either of <b>methoxamine</b> or B-HT 933 caused dose-related vasoconstriction, while both indoramin and yohimbine doubled forearm blood flow. Subsequently, the alpha 1 -adrenoceptor mediated vasoconstriction produced by <b>methoxamine</b> was shown to be completely blocked by indoramin pretreatment, and to be left unchanged by yohimbine. The alpha 2 -vascular stimulation by B-HT 933 was antagonized by previous yohimbine but not by indoramin pretreatment, thus fulfilling the pharmacological requirements for identification of distinct alpha-adrenoceptor mediated excitation-contraction pathways.

40|$|In the rat {{isolated}} vas deferens, <b>methoxamine</b> 8. 1 microM {{produced an}} initial phasic response that declined towards baseline and {{was followed by}} rhythmic contractions that continued until wash-out. These responses were predominant in the epididymal half. BaCl 2 1 mM produced a similar type of response which was not mediated by noradrenaline release or activation of alpha-adrenoceptors. The barium responses were similar in the epididymal and prostatic halves. Incubation in nominally Ca 2 +-free solution caused abolition or near abolition of rhythmic contractions produced by barium or <b>methoxamine.</b> The initial phasic response to <b>methoxamine</b> was abolished in Ca 2 +-free solution, whereas that produced by barium persisted. Rhythmic contractions produced by <b>methoxamine</b> or barium were inhibited by Mg 2 + (2. 4 - 20 mM) and by La 3 + (1 - 5 mM). Mg 2 + had selectivity for inhibition of the frequency of methoxamine- but not barium-induced rhythmic contractions. Despite their dependence on [Ca 2 +]o, barium- and methoxamine-induced rhythmic contractions were resistant to inhibition by calcium channel inhibitors. Verapamil, nifedipine and flunarazine inhibited the amplitude of rhythmic contractions more readily than the frequency (<b>methoxamine</b> IC 50 for verapamil: amplitude = 29. 8 +/- 5. 40 microM, n = 6, frequency = 96. 7 +/- 31. 0 microM, n = 5, for nifedipine: amplitude = 2. 42 +/- 0. 34 microM, n = 7, frequency = 3. 24 +/- 0. 75 microM, n = 7, and for flunarizine: amplitude = 15. 9 +/- 5. 95 microM, n = 7, frequency = 153 +/- 28. 6 microM, n = 7). There was no differentiation between inhibition of <b>methoxamine</b> and barium-induced responses. Like Mg 2 +, methoxyverapamil selectively inhibited the frequency of methoxamine-induced contractions (IC 50 : amplitude = 16. 8 +/- 2. 86 microM, n = 5, frequency = 2. 07 +/- 0. 81 microM, n = 5) but not barium-induced contractions (IC 50 : amplitude = 13. 9 +/- 1. 95 microM, n = 5, frequency = 48. 5 +/- 8. 98 microM, n = 5). Diazoxide (43. 3 - 2167 microM) and nitroprusside (3. 36 - 6712 microM) had only a small effect on barium contractions, but produced a dose-related reduction in the amplitude of methoxamine-induced responses. Diazoxide and nitroprusside caused <b>methoxamine</b> contractions to occur in groups, although they {{had no effect on}} their overall frequency. It is concluded that barium- and methoxamine-induced rhythmic contractions in the rat vas deferens are mediated by the entry of [Ca 2 +]o via membrane calcium channels that have a lower affinity (10 - 100 X) for calcium channel inhibitors than those mediating the KCl response.
