50|$|Mask {{aligners}} adjust a glass mask to a wafer with submicron precision. This {{is vital}} for the exposure process with which the microscopic picture on the glass mask is then transferred to the wafer. The SUSS MicroTec <b>mask</b> <b>aligner</b> also covers other process steps for wafer processing such as development of the resists and cleaning of the photo mask.|$|E
50|$|Another {{reason of}} {{choosing}} this structure in a multi-layer form {{is due to}} limitation on the structure when it has been fabricated on a single layer. The {{gap between the two}} resonant structures becomes very small and cannot easily be fabricated due to the limitations of low-cost fabrication technologies. In multi-layer circuits, the coupling between resonant sections is achieved by overlapping conductors which are separated by a thin dielectric layer. However, to some extent the problem of fabricating small gaps has been exchanged for that of achieving high alignment between the conductor layers. Normally a modern <b>mask</b> <b>aligner</b> will be needed to achieve the required degree of resolution.|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of the phase-shift method allows a significant resolution enhancement for proximity lithography in <b>mask</b> <b>aligners.</b> Typically a resolution of 3 mu m (half-pitch) at a proximity distance of 30 mu m is achieved utilizing binary photomasks. By using an alternating aperture phase shift photomask (AAPSM), a resolution of 1. 5 mu m (half-pitch) for non-periodic lines and spaces pattern was demonstrated at 30 mu m proximity gap. In a second attempt a diffractive photomask design for an elbow pattern having a half-pitch of 2 mu m was developed with an iterative design algorithm. The photomask was fabricated by electron-beam lithography and consists of binary amplitude and phase levels...|$|R
5000|$|In {{photolithography}} for {{the mass}} production of integrated circuit devices, the more correct term is usually photoreticle or simply reticle. In {{the case of a}} photomask, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the mask pattern and the wafer pattern. This was the standard for the 1:1 <b>mask</b> <b>aligners</b> that were succeeded by steppers and scanners with reduction optics. As used in steppers and scanners, the reticle commonly contains only one layer of the chip. (However, some photolithography fabrications utilize reticles with more than one layer patterned onto the same mask). The pattern is projected and shrunk by four or five times onto the wafer surface. To achieve complete wafer coverage, the wafer is repeatedly [...] "stepped" [...] from position to position under the optical column until full exposure is achieved.|$|R
40|$|We report {{our work}} on {{fabricating}} lithographically aligned patterned backgates on thin (50 - 60 μm) roman 3 -roman 5 semiconductor samples using single sided <b>mask</b> <b>aligners</b> only. Along with this we also present {{a way to}} photograph {{both sides of a}} thin patterned chip using inexpensive infra-red light emitting diodes (LED) and an inexpensive (consumer) digital camera. A robust method of contacting both sides of a sample using an ultrasonic bonder is described. In addition we present a mathematical model to analyse the variation of the electrochemical potential through the doped layers and heterojunctions that are normally present in most GaAs based devices. We utilise the technique and the estimates from our model to fabricate an electron-hole bilayer device in which each layer is separately contacted and has tunable densities. The electron and hole layers are separated by barriers either 25 or 15 nm wide. In both cases, the densities can be matched by using appropriate bias voltages. Comment: 7 pages, 8 EPS figures.

50|$|In 1949, Karl Süss {{founded the}} company Karl Süss KG to support sales and service for optical devices made by Ernst-Leitz GmbH, later Leica, in Munich, Germany. Then in 1963 the {{assignment}} by Siemens {{to develop a}} simple photolithography tool marked {{a change in the}} strategic direction of the company towards contract manufacturing and engineering. With the creation of the MJB3, the first <b>mask</b> <b>aligner</b> now exhibited in the Deutsches Museum in Munich, the company entered the emerging semiconductor industry. In addition to manual and automatic alignment equipment the product portfolio extended to systems for related wafer processing steps such as development, cleaning and wafer bonding. The company expanded into the global market with the foundation of its first overseas subsidiaries in the 1980s.|$|E
40|$|<b>Mask</b> <b>aligner</b> {{lithography}} is {{a well-established}} back-end fabrication process in microlithography. Within {{the last few}} years, resolution enhancement techniques have been transferred and adapted from projection lithography to further develop <b>mask</b> <b>aligner</b> lithography, especially concerning achievable resolution. Nonetheless, current technology using a mercury vapor lamp as a light source has reached its limits, e. g. for high-resolution pattering. Within this paper, we present {{the extension of the}} existing <b>mask</b> <b>aligner</b> illumination system by replacing the mercury vapor lamp with a solid-state laser. Full-field <b>mask</b> <b>aligner</b> lithography is guaranteed by a rotating diffuser expanding the laser beam and minimizing undesired speckle effects. An additional integrated galvanometer scanner allows a flexible choice of arbitrary angular spectrum distributions of the photomask illumination. We show versatile results like simple binary patterns of squares and triangles, as well as a more complex lateral shape like a blazed grating...|$|E
40|$|Contact- and {{proximity}} lithography in a <b>Mask</b> <b>Aligner</b> {{is a very}} {{cost effective}} technique for photolithography, as it provides a high throughput and very stable mature processes for critical dimensions of typically some microns. For shadow lithography, the printing quality depends much on the proximity gap and {{the properties of the}} illumination light. SUSS MicroOptics has recently introduced a novel illumination optics, referred as MO Exposure Optics, for all SUSS MicroTec Mask Aligners. MO Exposure Optics provides excellent uniformity of the illumination light, telecentric illumination and a full freedom to shape the angular spectrum of the mask illuminating light. This allows to simulate and optimize photolithography processes in a <b>Mask</b> <b>Aligner</b> from the light source to the final pattern in photoresist. The commercially available software LayoutLab (GenISys) allows to optimize <b>Mask</b> <b>Aligner</b> Lithography beyond its current limits, by both shaping the illumination light (Customized Illumination) and optimizing the photomask pattern (Optical Proximity Correction, OPC). Dr. LiTHO, a second simulation tool developed by Fraunhofer IISB fro Front-End Lithography, includes rigorous models and algorithms for the simulation, evaluation and optimization of lithographic processes. A new exposure module in the Dr. LiTHO software now allows a more flexible definition of illumination geometries coupled to the standard resist modules for proximity lithography in a <b>Mask</b> <b>Aligner.</b> Results from simulation and experiment will be presented...|$|E
40|$|Developing a {{cost-effective}} nanolithography strategy {{that enables the}} production of subwavelength features with various shapes over large areas is a long-standing goal in the nanotechnology community. Herein, an inexpensive nanolithographic technique that combines the wafer-scale production capability of photolithography with the subwavelength feature size controllability of near-field photolithography was developed to fabricate centimeter-scale up to wafer-scale sub- 100 -nm variously shaped nanopatterns on surfaces. The wafer-scale elastomeric trench-based photomasks with subwavelength apertures created at the apexes were compatible with <b>mask</b> <b>aligners,</b> allowing {{for the production of}} wafer-scale subwavelength nanopatterns with adjustable feature sizes, shapes, and periodicities. The smallest feature sizes of 50 and 80 nm were achieved on positive tone and negative tone photoresist surfaces, respectively, which could be ascribed to a near-field optical effect. The fabricated centimeter-scale nanopatterns were functionalized to study cell-matrix adhesion and migration. Compared to currently developed nanolithographic methods that approach similar functionalities, this facile nanolithographic strategy combines the merits of low cost, subwavelength feature size, high throughput, and varied feature shapes, making it an affordable approach to be used in academic research for researchers at most institutions. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: Microcontact {{printing}} (μCP) {{of proteins}} {{is widely used}} for biosensors and cell biology but is constrained to printing proteins adsorbed to a low free energy, hydrophobic surface to a high free energy, hydrophilic surface. This strongly limits μCP as harsh chemical treatments are required to form a high energy surface. Here, we introduce humidified μCP (HμCP) of proteins which enables universal printing of protein on any smooth surface. We found that by flowing water in proximity to proteins adsorbed on a hydrophilized stamp, the water vapor diffusing through the stamp enables the printing of proteins on both low and high energy surfaces. Indeed, when proteins are printed using stamps with increasing spacing between water-filled microchannels, only proteins adjacent to the channels are transferred. The vapor transport through the stamp was modeled, and by comparing the humidity profiles with the protein patterns, 88 % relative humidity in the stamp was identified as the threshold for HμCP. The molecular forces occurring between PDMS, peptides, and glass during printing were modeled ab initio to confirm the critical role water plays in the transfer. Using HμCP, we introduce straightforward protocols to pattern multiple proteins side-by-side down to nanometer resolution {{without the need for}} expensive <b>mask</b> <b>aligners,</b> but instead exploiting self-alignment effects derived from the stamp geometry. Finally, we introduce vascularized HμCP stamps with embedded microchannels that allow printing proteins as arbitrary, large areas patterns with nanometer resolution. This work introduces the general concept of water...|$|R
40|$|The {{control of}} very small {{distances}} {{is essential for}} many applications and alignment procedures {{in the field of}} micro technology, e. g. micro lithography for MEMS or micro optics, where proximity lithography is often used for cost effective mass fabrication. Also in proximity lithography the requirements, especially for resolution, are increasing permanently. Recently new techniques have been developed to get sub-micron resolution even for larger distances between mask and substrate. But then also the proximity distance has to be controlled with sub-micron accuracy. A passive and an active sensor concept have been developed based on triangulation using diffractive structures. The required sensing patterns are implemented directly in the photo mask. In the passive gap alignment the distance can be reconstructed from the resist pattern obtained {{as a result of a}} lithographic step in which the diffractive sensor structure is exposed in the Mask-Aligner. In the active configuration the proximity gap can be controlled already during the alignment procedure prior to the lithographic exposure. A collimated laser beam irradiates a diffractive structure in the photo mask, which deflects the beam which will be reflected from the resist coated substrate towards the mask. A second mask structure, which is placed in a defined lateral distance to the first one, acts then as a ruler for the distance between mask and wafer and can be observed through the alignment microscope or a camera module. The design and fabrication of the diffractive structures, the measurement results for the full-wafer proximity distance distribution according to the passive method, as well as the realization of an active sensor module for <b>mask</b> <b>aligners</b> are presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Mask {{aligners}} {{were the}} dominating lithography {{tool for the}} first 20 years of semiconductor industry. In the 1980 s industry changed over to projection lithography. However, mask aligners were never sorted out and still today hundreds of new mask aligners are sold each year. This continuing success of <b>mask</b> <b>aligner</b> lithography is due to two basic trends in lithography: (a) Costs for leading-edge lithography tools double approximately every 4. 4 years; and (b) the number of lithography steps per wafer was increasing from a few litho layers to more than 35 layers now. This explains why mask aligners, a very cost-effective solution for uncritical litho layers, are still widely used today. In over 50 years of semiconductor industry the <b>mask</b> <b>aligner</b> system has changed tremendously. However, only little effort was undertaken to improve the shadow printing process itself. We now present a new illumination system for mask aligners, the MO Exposure Optics (MOEO), {{which is based on}} t wo microlens-type Köhler integrators located in Fourier-conjugated planes. The optics stabilizes the illumination against misalignment of the lamp-to-ellipsoid position. It provides improved light uniformity, telecentric illumination and allows freely shaping the angular spectrum of the illumination light by spatial filtering. It significantly improves the CD uniformity, the yield in production and opens the door to a new era of Advanced <b>Mask</b> <b>Aligner</b> Lithography (AMALITH), where customized illumination, optical proximity correction (OPC), Talbot-lithography, phase shift masks (AAPSM) and source mask optimization (SMO) are introduced to <b>mask</b> <b>aligner</b> lithography...|$|E
40|$|A new {{illumination}} system for <b>mask</b> <b>aligner</b> lithography is presented. The {{illumination system}} uses two subsequent microlens-based Köhler integrators. The second Köhler integrator {{is located in}} the Fourier plane of the first. The new illumination system uncouples the illumination light from the light source and provides excellent uniformity of the light irradiance and the angular spectrum. Spatial filtering allows to freely shape the angular spectrum to minimize diffraction effects in contact and proximity lithography. Telecentric illumination and ability to precisely control the illumination light allows to introduce resolution enhancement technologies (RET) like customized illumination, optical proximity correction (OPC) and source-mask optimization (SMO) in <b>mask</b> <b>aligner</b> lithography...|$|E

We are presenting a novel <b>mask</b> <b>aligner</b> tool that allows shifting the photomask with high accuracy between sequential exposure shots.

Average alignment accuracy of 1 μm {{with a standard}} deviation 0. 4 μm in both X and Y directions was obtained in ten consecutive tests of multilevel NIL. The multilevel alignment was achieved by aligning the wafer and the <b>mask</b> with an <b>aligner,</b> fixing them with a holder, and imprinting in an imprint machine. The issues that are critical to the alignment accuracy, such as relative movement during the press, relative thermal expansion, wafer bending, and resist, are discussed.

40|$|One and two {{dimensional}} grating structures with submicron period {{have a huge}} number of applications in optics and photonics. Such structures are conventionally fabricated using interference or e-beam lithography. However, both technologies have significant drawbacks. Interference lithography is limited to rather simple geometries and the sequential writing scheme of e-beam lithography leads to time consuming exposures for each grating. We present a novel fabrication technique for this class of microstructures which is based on proximity lithography in a <b>mask</b> <b>aligner.</b> The technology is capable to pattern a complete wafer within less than one minute of exposure time and offers thereby high lateral resolution and a reliable process. Our advancements compared to standard <b>mask</b> <b>aligner</b> lithography are twofold: First of all, we are using periodic binary phase masks instead of chromium masks to generate an aerial image of high resolution and exceptional light efficiency at cert ain distances behind the mask. Second, a special <b>mask</b> <b>aligner</b> illumination set-up is employed which allows to precisely control the incidence angles of the exposure light. This degree of freedom allows both, to shape the aerial image (e. g. transformation of a periodic spot pattern into a chessboard pattern) and to increase its depth of focus considerably. That way, our technology enables the fabrication of high quality gratings with arbitrary geometry in a fast and stable wafer scale process...|$|E

40|$|<b>Mask</b> <b>aligner</b> lithography, {{based on}} shadow printing, {{is one of}} the most natural {{approaches}} to micro-fabrication. For high-yield processing, however, contact-free proximity exposures are required, which have stringent resolution limitations. Therefore, resolution enhancement techniques (RETs) for proximity lithography have been a field of extensive research over the past four decades. Refinements like X-ray proximity lithography, near field holography (NFH), phase-shifting masks (PSM), Talbot lithography (TL), holographic lithography, displacement Talbot lithography (D-TL), and rigorously optimized phase-shifting masks (RO-PSM) have been proposed to combine flexible and economical process conditions with high resolution potential. In conjunction with ongoing technical innovations for the mask-to-substrate distance metrology, leveling, illumination optics, and photomask technology, the application potential of proximity lithography has extended significantly compared with the established process of shadow printing. This review provides a comprehensive overview of resolution enhancement techniques and technical innovations in <b>mask</b> <b>aligner</b> lithography, especially the fabrication of periodic structures for nano-optical components.

40|$|Mask Aligners {{are used}} in the Semiconductor Industry to {{transfer}} structures with moderate resolution requirements onto substrates. With the casting of the shadow a photochemical reactive resist is exposed. As diffraction appears at the mask structures the exposure wavelength and the proximity gap between mask and wafer influence the quality of the image in the resist. As both parameters are very often not changeable for processes there is a big need to find another way to improve the resist image. In this paper a new approach to enhance the exposure result will be presented. MO Exposure Optics, a novel illumination system for Mask Aligners, uses a combination of two microlens Köhler Integrators. MO Exposure Optics decouples the illumination system in a <b>Mask</b> <b>Aligner</b> from the lamp and ensures a uniform angular spectrum over the whole mask plane.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a complete methodology for process window optimization in proximity <b>mask</b> <b>aligner</b> lithography. The commercially available lithography simulation software LAB from GenISys GmbH {{was used for}} simulation of light propagation and 3 D resist development. The methodology was tested for the practical example of lines and spaces, 5 micron half-pitch, printed in a 1 micron thick layer of AZ® 1512 HS 1 positive photoresist on a silicon wafer. A SUSS MicroTec MA 8 <b>mask</b> <b>aligner,</b> equipped with MO Exposure Optics® was used in simulation and experiment. MO Exposure Optics® is the latest generation of illumination systems for mask aligners. MO Exposure Optics® provides telecentric illumination and excellent light uniformity over the full mask field. MO Exposure Optics® allows the lithography engineer to freely shape the angular spectrum of the illumination light (customized illumination), which is a mandatory requirement for process window optimization. Three different illuminat ion settings have been tested for 0 to 100 micron proximity gap. The results obtained prove, that the introduced process window methodology is {{a major step forward}} to obtain more robust processes in <b>mask</b> <b>aligner</b> lithography. The most remarkable outcome of the presented study is that a smaller exposure gap does not automatically lead to better print results in proximity lithography - what the "good instinct" of a lithographer would expect. With more than 5 ' 000 mask aligners installed in research and industry worldwide, the proposed process window methodology might have significant impact on yield improvement and cost saving in industry...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In Micro/Nanowire fabrication, the {{alignment}} and exposure process {{are the most}} critical steps in photolithography process, and indeed for the whole biochip processing. This process determines the success of transferring the Micro/Nanowire design pattern on the mask to the photoresists on the wafer surface. Hence, the resolution requirements and precise alignment are vital; each mask needs to be precisely aligned with original alignment mark in order to transfer the original pattern from mask onto photoresist layer. Otherwise, it can’t successfully transfer the original pattern to the wafer surface causing device and circuit failure. Therefore, the UniMAP’s Second Generation <b>Mask</b> <b>Aligner</b> is used for precise alignment and pattern transfer process.
