To compare the amount of resources invested into both types of diaspores, we used nitrogen content as a proxy (compare Ashman 1994). Shifts in the bulbil/seed ratio have a strong impact on clonal diversity of a species (since not only numbers, but also establishment probabilities of the respective diaspore types matter), but are as well recognizable by different resource allocation and changes in numbers of these propagules.|$|R

40|$|TeV {{emission}} from a {{class of}} BL Lacertae (BL) objects is commonly modeled as radiation from relativistically moving homogeneous plasma blobs. In the context of these models, the blob Lorentz factors needed to reproduce the (corrected for absorption by the IR background) TeV emission are large (δ≳ 50) are required to reproduce via Synchrotron-Self Compton (SSC) the observed TeV emission. The main {{reason for this is}} that stronger beaming eases the problem of the lack of ∼ IR-UV synchrotron seed photons needed to produce the de-absorbed ∼ few TeV peak of the spectral energy distribution (SED). However, such high Doppler factors are in strong disagreement with the unified scheme, according to which BLs are FR I radio galaxies with their jets closely aligned to the line of sight. Here, motivated by the detection of sub-luminal velocities in the sub-pc scale jets of the best studied TeV blazars, MKN 421 and MKN 501. we examine the possibility that the relativistic flow in the TeV BLs is longitudinally decelerating. In this case, the problem of the <b>missing</b> <b>seed</b> photons is solved due to Upstream Compton (UC) scattering, a process in which the upstream energetic electrons from the fast base of the flow 'see' the synchrotron seed photons produced in the slow part of the flow relativistically beamed. Modest Lorentz factors (Γ kim 15 s). decelerating down to values compatible with the recent radio interferometric observations, reproduce the ∼ few TeV peak energy of these sources. Furthermore, such decelerating flows are shown to be in agreement with the BL - FR I unification...|$|R

40|$|The {{restoration}} of degraded forests to enhance biodiversity, ecosystem services, {{as well as}} climate change mitigation and adaptation is now a major priority in cities around the world. This study evaluated the success of the Buffelsdraai Landfill Site Community Reforestation Project in Durban, South Africa, by assessing ecological attributes. Measures of plant richness, diversity, vegetation structure, invasive alien plants (IAPs) and ecological processes were contrasted across a chronosequence of habitats under restoration (0 -year-old, 3 -year-old and 5 -year-old) and compared with a reference forest habitat (remnant natural forest). Native tree species recruitment and vegetation structure increased with restoration age. Ecological processes, represented by the composition of pollination and seed dispersal traits in all of the habitats under restoration, were similar to the reference habitat. However, low tree density and an increase in IAP cover with an increase in restoration age were identified as threats to reforestation success. We recommend enrichment planting and an effective IAP management strategy to promote more rapid habitat restoration while reducing site maintenance costs. Enrichment planting should not only focus on increasing tree species density and richness, but also on the inclusion of species with <b>missing</b> pollination and <b>seed</b> dispersal categories.

(1952) New Light on the Most Ancient East (Routledge & Kegan Paul, London) ]. In {{investigating}} the cultural processes that could have led from gathering to intentional cultivation, various authors have discussed and tested wild cereal harvesting techniques. Some argue that Near Eastern foragers gathered grains by means of sickle harvesting, uprooting, plucking (hand stripping), or beating into baskets [Hillman, G. C. & Davies, M. S. (1999) in Prehistory of Agriculture: New Experimental and Ethnographic Approaches, ed. Anderson, P. (The Institute of Archaeology, University of California, Los Angeles), pp. 70 – 102]. During systematic experiments, we found that archaeobotanical data from regional Neolithic sites support ground collection of grains by early hunter-gatherers. Ground collecting suits the natural shattering of wild species that ripen and drop grains at the beginning of summer. We show that continual collection off the ground from May to October would have provided surplus grains for deliberate sowing in more desirable fields, and facilitate the transition to intentional cultivation. Because ground gathering enabled collectors to observe that fallen seeds are responsible for the growth of new plants in late fall, they became aware of the profitability of sowing their surplus seeds for next year's food.

40|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 1990 's, spelt cultivation in Finland was rather unknown. First cultivation experiments at the organic research farm of MTT/Agricultural Engineering Research (Vakola) were done in co-operation with some farmers since 1993. Many farmers showed interest in cultivating spelt because of curiosity about crops suitable for organic farming, competition leadership by marketing new niche products, and consumers demand for healthy and high quality food produced pro-environmentally. Constraints like lack of certified organic <b>seeds,</b> <b>missing</b> national legislation for propagation of spelt seeds, unsuitable drilling machines, inappropriate dehusking machinery, and lack of marketing infrastructure are compensated by a wide product range made of spelt: whole grains, flours, break flour, flakes, semolina, and green kernel (made of yellow ripe spelt dried with smoke of beech wood). Spelt husk is used to fill mattresses and cushions or as litter. Cultivation of spelt and marketing of spelt products in Finland showed that this versatile cereal created new initiatives amongst farmers, processors, traders, and consumers. Consequently, farmers, millers and retailers established processing sites, arranged local marketing of spelt products in healthy food shops, schools, and kindergartens, participated in exhibitions and organised seminars. The "new" crop also rises questions concerning legislation, research, nutrition, and health. There is a strong need for research in nutritional and allergy issues. The most important challenge for the future will be to find new ways learning co-operation between all members the food chain. This concerns the development of common strategies for production, processing, marketing, and research in the sense of brotherliness in economic life.

The low frequencies help determine the kinematically relevant, low-wavenumber components of the velocity model, which are in turn needed to avoid convergence of FWI to spurious local minima. However, acquiring data below 2 or 3 Hz from the field is a challenging and expensive task. In this paper we explore the possibility of synthesizing the low frequencies computationally from high-frequency data, and use the resulting prediction of the <b>missing</b> data to <b>seed</b> the frequency sweep of FWI. As a signal processing problem, bandwidth extension is a very nonlinear and delicate operation. It requires a high-level interpretation of bandlimited seismic records into individual events, each of which is extrapolable to a lower (or higher) frequency band from the non-dispersive nature of the wave propagation model. We propose to use the phase tracking method for the event separation task. The fidelity of the resulting extrapolation method is typically higher in phase than in amplitude. To demonstrate the reliability of bandwidth extension in the context of FWI, we first use the low frequencies in the extrapolated band as data substitute, in order to create the low-wavenumber background velocity model, and then switch to recorded data in the available band for the rest of the iterations. The resulting method, EFWI for short, demonstrates surprising robustness to the inaccuracies in the extrapolated low frequency data. With two synthetic examples calibrated so that regular FWI needs to be initialized at 1 Hz to avoid local minima, we demonstrate that FWI based on an extrapolated [1, 5] Hz band, itself generated from data available in the [5, 15] Hz band, can produce reasonable estimations of the low wavenumber velocity models...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFor an {{effective}} {{conservation and management}} in grasslands {{it is essential to}} understand mechanisms sustaining biodiversity. To gain knowledge is especially crucial in stressed grasslands harbouring a unique flora and fauna, like alkali grasslands. Aboveground vegetation, seed bank and environmental factors were studied in three stands of the following alkali grassland types: (i) Artemisia dry alkali grasslands at highest elevations; (ii) Puccinellia high and (iii) Puccinellia low grasslands at medium to low elevations, and (iv) Juncus wet alkali grasslands at the lowest elevations. We tested the following hypotheses: (i) Seed bank species diversity and density are the highest in the most stressed grassland types, where regeneration by seeds could have a major importance in sustaining vegetation diversity. (ii) Seed bank density of hygrophytes increases with decreasing elevation, because the cover of hygrophytes in the vegetation increases with decreasing elevation. The mean seed bank density ranged from 30, 104 up to 51, 410 seeds/m 2, which is higher than in most dry grasslands. Both the lowest seed bank density and diversity were detected in the most stressed Puccinellia high grasslands; Spergularia salina was the only abundant seed bank species (possessing at least 1000 seeds/m 2). These results not supported our first hypothesis. We detected the highest seed densities of almost all hygrophyte species in the lowest-elevated Juncus grasslands. But, we did not find a significant monotonous correlation between elevation and the overall hygrophyte seed bank density; because most of the hygrophyte species were <b>missing</b> from the <b>seed</b> bank at the medium-elevated, but most saline Puccinellia grasslands. Thus, our results only partly supported the second hypothesis. In total we detected more species in the seed bank than in the aboveground vegetation which emphasises that seed bank {{plays an important role in}} sustaining the diversity of alkali grasslands. However, characteristic graminoids possessed no considerable seed bank, except for Juncus compressus (up to 38, 619 seeds/m 2). We can conclude that persistence and establishment of most alkali grassland species are not supported by the local persistent seed bank...|$|R
