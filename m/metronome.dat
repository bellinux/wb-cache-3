5|$|Foundational {{elements}} for a student's learning {{were having a}} concept of (principally diatonic) scales as music and a basis for harmony. One of the teaching tools often used by Tristano, including for scales, was the <b>metronome.</b> The student set the <b>metronome</b> at or near its slowest setting initially, and gradually increased its speed, allowing a sense of time to develop, along with confidence in placing each note.|$|E
5|$|In 1925 the Requiem was {{published}} in Vienna as a pocket score, Philharmonia-Taschenpartitur No.284. Edition Peters published it in 1928, stating the performance duration as 25minutes, although the duration implied by the <b>metronome</b> marking is 14minutes.|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we study the {{dynamics}} of coupled oscillators. We use mechanical <b>metronomes</b> that are placed over a rigid base. The base moves by a motor in a one-dimensional direction and {{the movements of the}} base follow some functions of the phases of the <b>metronomes</b> (in other words, it is controlled to move according to a provided function). Because of the motor and the feedback, the phases of the <b>metronomes</b> affect the movements of the base while on the other hand, when the base moves, it affects the phases of the <b>metronomes</b> in return. For a simple function for the base movement (such as y = γ_x [r θ_ 1 + (1 - r) θ_ 2] in which y is the velocity of the base, γ_x is a multiplier, r is a proportion and θ_ 1 and θ_ 2 are phases of the <b>metronomes),</b> we show the effects on the dynamics of the oscillators. Then we study how this function changes in time when its parameters adapt by a feedback. By numerical simulations and experimental tests, we show that the dynamic of the set of oscillators and the base tends to evolve towards a certain region. This region is close to a transition in dynamics of the oscillators; where more frequencies start to appear in the frequency spectra of the phases of the <b>metronomes...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{demonstrate}} sub-harmonic {{injection locking}} (SHIL) in mechanical <b>metronomes.</b> To do so, we first formulate <b>metronome's</b> physical compact model, focusing on its nonlinear terms for friction and the escapement mechanism. Then we analyze <b>metronomes</b> using phase-macromodel-based techniques {{and show that}} the phase of their oscillation is in fact very immune to periodic perturbation at twice its natural frequency, making SHIL difficult. Guided by the phase-macromodel-based analysis, {{we are able to}} modify the escapement mechanism of <b>metronomes</b> such that SHIL can happen more easily. Then we verify the occurrence of SHIL in experiments. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of SHIL in metronomes; As such, it provides many valuable insights into the modelling, simulation, analysis and design of nonlinear oscillators. The demonstration is also suitable to use for teaching the subject of injection locking and SHIL...|$|R
40|$|Recently, oscillator-based Boolean {{computation}} {{has been}} proposed for its potentials in noise immunity and energy efficiency. In such a system, logic bits are encoded in the relative phases of oscillating signals and stored in injection-locked oscillators. To show that the scheme is very general and not specific to electronic oscillators, in this paper, we report our work on storing a phase-based logic bit in the relative phase between two mechanical <b>metronomes.</b> While the synchronization of <b>metronomes</b> {{is a classic example}} showing the effects of injection locking, our work takes it one step further by demonstrating the bistable phase in sub-harmonically injection-locked <b>metronomes</b> [...] - a key mechanism for oscillator-based Boolean computation. Although we do not expect to make computers with <b>metronomes,</b> our study demonstrates the generality of this new computation paradigm and may inspire its practical implementations in various fields, eg, MEMS, silicon photonics, spintronics, synthetic biology, etc...|$|R
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Kempelen, the Turk {{remained}} unexhibited until some time before 1804 when Kempelen's son decided {{to sell it to}} Johann Nepomuk Mälzel, a Bavarian musician with an interest in various machines and devices. Mälzel, whose successes included patenting a form of <b>metronome,</b> had tried to purchase the Turk once before, before Kempelen's death. The original attempt had failed, owing to Kempelen's asking price of 20,000 francs; Kempelen's son sold the machine to Mälzel for half this sum.|$|E

Large posters of postage stamps adorned the stage as props; the minimal arrangement was {{received as a}} boldly simple choice. Sets included a combination {{of old and new}} material. As in the past, the band was backed by a tape deck playing drum tracks or a <b>metronome</b> in lieu of a full rhythm section.|$|E
5|$|Fellow {{players on}} the Italian {{national}} team nicknamed Pirlo l'architetto ("the Architect"), {{because of the way}} in which he buildt plays, and set up goal-scoring opportunities with long, lobbed through passes. In later seasons, Juventus fans also dubbed him il professore ("the professor"), Maestro, and Mozart, as a reference to the Austrian composer's prodigious ability. Pirlo was also frequently compared to fellow former Milan and Italy playmaker Demetrio Albertini early in his Milan career, due to their similar characteristics and style of play. Pirlo was often thought to be Albertini's heir for Milan and the national side; he inherited his nickname the <b>metronome</b> whilst playing at Milan, for the way in which he influenced games by controlling the tempo of his team's play through his direct and efficient passing game in midfield, as well as his ability to make himself available to teammates to receive and distribute the ball.|$|E
40|$|When {{listening}} to music, humans perceive underlying temporal regularities. The most perceptually salient {{of these is}} the beat, what listeners would tap or clap to when engaging with music, and what listeners use to anchor the events in the musical surface to a temporal framework. However, we do not know if people perceive those beats in hierarchically ordered relationships, with some beats heard as stronger and others as weaker, as proposed by musical theory. These hierarchical relationships would theoretically be advantageous in orienting attention to particular locations in musical time, and facilitate synchronizing musical behavior such as performing or dancing. In two experiments, I investigated if listeners perceive multiple levels of beats structured hierarchically, and if they use that information to decide if metrically-structured <b>metronomes</b> match or mismatch music. In Experiment 1, musicians and non-musicians alike gave higher ratings of fit to <b>metronomes</b> that matched musical excerpts at two levels of a hierarchy over those that matched at only one or no levels. In Experiment 2, I had musicians and non-musicians rate the fit of auditory and visual <b>metronomes</b> to music, and administered tests of intelligence and musical aptitude to determine if these factors impacted metrical perception. Musicians and non-musicians rated visual <b>metronomes</b> similarly to auditory <b>metronomes,</b> once again giving highest ratings of fit to fully-metrically-matching <b>metronomes</b> over those that matched at one or no levels. Musical aptitude and intelligence did not relate to meter perception in any systematic way. With musicians and non-musicians alike able to match <b>metronomes</b> to music on two metrical levels, this suggests that perceiving a hierarchical structure of beats may be a natural way in which listeners organize their perception of time and make sense of the musical events they hear...|$|R

40|$|Spontaneous {{synchronization}} of {{an ensemble}} of <b>metronomes</b> {{placed on a}} freely rotating platform is studied experimentally and by computer simulations. A striking in-phase synchronization is observed when the metronomes' beat frequencies are fixed above a critical limit.

25|$|The {{dawn of the}} First World War in July 1914 {{brought an}} end to the feud between the two rival orchestras: the Helsinki Symphony Orchestra {{collapsed}} after the German musicians who formed its backbone were expelled from the country, and Kajanus and Schnéevoigt divided conducting duties for a joint orchestra, the Helsinki City Orchestra, that consisted of about forty players surviving on starvation wages. As a result of the merger, Madetoja (and, a year later, Kuula) became expendable; with little money, Madetoja pawned his <b>metronome</b> in an attempt to stave off penury. Despite the hostilities, he traveled to Russia in September 1914 to take up the conductorship of the Viipuri Orchestra (1914–1916). Madetoja found the Viipuri Orchestra in a state of relative devastation: he was able to piece together 19 musicians, a reality that forced him to spend much of his time finding and arranging material for such an undersized ensemble.|$|E
25|$|During {{the later}} {{part of the}} 16th-century Amsterdam's Rederijkerskamer (Chamber of rhetoric) {{organised}} contests between different Chambers in the reading of poetry and drama. In 1638, Amsterdam opened its first theatre. Ballet performances were given in this theatre as early as 1642. In the 18th century, French theatre became popular. While Amsterdam was {{under the influence of}} German music in the 19th century there were few national opera productions; the Hollandse Opera of Amsterdam was built in 1888 for the specific purpose of promoting Dutch opera. In the 19th century, popular culture was centred on the Nes area in Amsterdam (mainly vaudeville and music-hall). The <b>metronome,</b> {{one of the most important}} advances in European classical music, was invented here in 1812 by Dietrich Nikolaus Winkel. At the end of this century, the Rijksmuseum and Stedelijk Museum were built. In 1888, the Concertgebouworkest was established. With the 20th century came cinema, radio and television. Though most studios are located in Hilversum and Aalsmeer, Amsterdam's influence on programming is very strong. Many people who work in the television industry live in Amsterdam. Also, the headquarters of the Dutch SBS Broadcasting Group is located in Amsterdam.|$|E
