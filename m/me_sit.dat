It opens with Beyoncé expressing feelings of lust in the first line, [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>sit</b> this assssss [...] on ya" [...] for which she adopts a soft and sultry vocal style. She further sings about love-making with a male lover and the second line includes the lyrics: [...] "Let me take this off while you watch me / that's my'ass appeal". It features explicit and metaphorical lyrics throughout and sees Beyoncé instructing her love interest to watch her perform a striptease. She further talks about how their evening together is going to proceed with lyrics such as [...] "If you like you can touch it babe, do you wanna touch it baby?".|$|E
500|$|In November 1987 Harrison {{released}} the platinum album Cloud Nine. Co-produced with Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra, the LP included Harrison's rendition of James Ray's [...] "Got My Mind Set on You", which went to {{number one in}} the US and number two in the UK. The accompanying music video received substantial airplay, and another single, [...] "When We Was Fab", a retrospective of the Beatles' career, earned two MTV Music Video Awards nominations in 1988. Recorded at his estate in Friar Park, Harrison's slide guitar playing featured prominently on the album, which included several of his long-time musical collaborators, including Clapton, Jim Keltner, and Jim Horn, who recalled Harrison's relaxed and friendly demeanour during the sessions: [...] "George made you feel at home, in his home... He once had <b>me</b> <b>sit</b> on a toilet and play my soprano sax, and they miked it {{at the end of the}} hall for a distant sound. I thought they were kidding... Another time he stopped me in the middle of a sax solo and brought me 3 p.m. tea—again I thought he was kidding." [...] Cloud Nine reached number eight and number ten on the US and UK charts respectively, and several tracks from the album achieved placement on Billboards Mainstream Rock chart – [...] "Devil's Radio", [...] "This Is Love" [...] and [...] "Cloud 9".|$|E
2500|$|For the film's opening crawl, Lucas {{originally}} wrote {{a composition}} consisting of six paragraphs with four sentences each. He said, [...] "The crawl {{is such a}} hard thing {{because you have to}} be careful that you're not using too many words that people don't understand. It's like a poem." [...] Lucas showed his draft to his friends. Director Brian De Palma, who was there, described it: [...] "The crawl at the beginning looks like it was written on a driveway. It goes on forever. It's gibberish." [...] Lucas recounted what De Palma said the first time he saw it: [...] "George, you're out of your mind! Let <b>me</b> <b>sit</b> down and write this for you." [...] De Palma helped to edit the text into the form used in the film.|$|E

6000|$|... "Tell me first, King, who dwell {{far away}} and alone, knowing little of what passes {{in the land of}} Life, what the Zulus desire to do. Before <b>me</b> <b>sits</b> the Great Council of the Nation. Let it speak." ...|$|R
60|$|LADY CICILY. Oh, don't ask <b>me</b> to <b>sit</b> doing nothing. It bores me so.|$|R
6000|$|Cel. What, {{would you}} have <b>me</b> <b>sit</b> still, and look upon you, like a little puppy-dog, that's taught to beg with his fore-leg up? ...|$|E
60|$|So I rose to go, but as I went some impulse {{seemed to}} take him and he called me back and made <b>me</b> <b>sit</b> down again.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Noa--disn't now--and Jan is no {{sweetheart}} of mine, {{ever since}} he danced at his mother's feast with Kitty Rutlege, and let <b>me</b> <b>sit</b> still; that a did.' ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was a great}} relief, not to say a {{probable}} necessity, for <b>me</b> to <b>sit</b> down just then.|$|R
60|$|I {{got up to}} go. With an ironical {{gesture of}} remonstrance, she signed to <b>me</b> to <b>sit</b> down again.|$|R
60|$|LUBIN. I {{confess that}} had not {{occurred}} to <b>me</b> [he <b>sits</b> down abruptly, evidently very unfavorably affected by this new light].|$|R
60|$|I {{clung to}} him and begged and pleaded, {{but he was not}} moved. He made <b>me</b> <b>sit</b> down again, and told me I must hear him out.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You lucky dogs! Let <b>me</b> <b>sit</b> here {{while you}} talk. I shan't be a {{skeleton}} at the feast.--Cassavetti, where are you? Your English is {{as bad as}} ever.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{suppose it}} was the {{recollection}} of the same words {{in the mouth of}} Buck MacGinnis that made <b>me</b> <b>sit</b> up with a jerk and stare at him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nay, kind sir,' {{said the}} portly dame, much flattered by the proposal; 'it {{is not for}} <b>me</b> to <b>sit</b> with gentles like yourselves.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was kept}} here for Grandfather and <b>me</b> to <b>sit</b> in together," [...] said little Alice, [...] "and for Grandfather {{to tell stories}} about." ...|$|R
60|$|She left <b>me</b> to <b>sit</b> {{a little}} longer by the screen, and I {{heard the sound of}} her feet die out along the gallery above.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, Caterina,' he {{answered}} gravely; 'I want you. I have something very particular {{to say to}} you. Will you let <b>me</b> <b>sit</b> down with you for half an hour?' ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Larramie and Walter {{promised to}} get up some fine {{excursions}} if I would stay a little longer, and Genevieve made <b>me</b> <b>sit</b> down beside her under a tree.|$|E

6000|$|THE FLOWER GIRL. Well, if you was a gentleman, {{you might}} ask <b>me</b> to <b>sit</b> down, I think. Don't I tell you I'm {{bringing}} you business? ...|$|R
60|$|My limb now allows <b>me</b> to <b>sit</b> in some peace: to walk I {{have yet}} no {{prospect}} of, as I can't mark {{it to the}} ground.|$|R
60|$|It {{must have}} been ten days after this that he stopped me {{in one of my}} eternal {{listless}} promenades and invited <b>me</b> to <b>sit</b> beside him again.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, yes. Marilda let <b>me</b> <b>sit</b> in the school-room, and I had books, {{and things}} to copy; such an angel, Cherry, I'll {{bring it to}} you next time--my copy, I mean.' ...|$|E
60|$|HIGGINS [catching her wrists] Ah! would you? Claws in, you cat. How {{dare you}} show your temper to <b>me?</b> <b>Sit</b> down and be quiet. [He throws her roughly into the easy-chair].|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I shall {{walk down}} to Bedsworth myself," [...] said Kate angrily. [...] "I {{have no doubt that}} the people in the post office will let <b>me</b> <b>sit</b> there and write it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, most pertinent. Did you not ask <b>me</b> to <b>sit</b> in {{judgment}} upon this matter? And unless you confess to me, how am I to absolve you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't believe that," [...] said Tom, [...] "you can't expect <b>me</b> to <b>sit</b> {{here and}} {{look at you and}} believe that. How long has he known you?" ...|$|R

60|$|Thereupon {{the officer}} bade <b>me</b> <b>sit</b> down, {{and began to}} help me, and join in the meal. ‘I fill your ladyship’s glass,’ said he, and handed me a tumbler of neat rum.|$|E
6000|$|DAISY. [Charmingly.] Now {{you come}} and talk to <b>me.</b> <b>Sit</b> very still now or you'll fall off. [To the little boy.] I wonder how old you are. [To the old man.] Wu? Liu? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And why not, Lady? Would {{you have}} had <b>me</b> <b>sit</b> still and hear those fat trollops of the East exalted above you? Would {{you have had}} me so disloyal to your royal loveliness?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My name is Colonel Fitzmaurice," [...] was the courteous reply. [...] "You {{will allow}} <b>me</b> to <b>sit</b> down? I have the {{pleasure}} of conversing, I believe, with Mr. Sydney Barnes?" ...|$|R
60|$|BILL [sullenly] I ain't {{afraid of}} him. I ain't afraid of ennybody. But he can lick me. She's done <b>me.</b> [He <b>sits</b> down moodily {{on the edge}} of the horse trough].|$|R
