500|$|Olivier and Esmond {{married on}} 25 July 1930 at All Saints, Margaret Street, {{although}} within weeks both realised they had erred. Olivier later recorded {{that the marriage}} was [...] "a pretty crass mistake. I insisted on getting married from a pathetic mixture of religious and animal promptings.... She had admitted to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> in love elsewhere and could never love me as completely as I would wish". Olivier later recounted that following the wedding he did not keep a diary for ten years and never followed religious practices again, although he considered those facts to be [...] "mere coincidence", unconnected to the nuptials.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{incidents}} in the Genesis narrative demonstrate that adultery was understood to be a natural phenomenon. [...] These occur in the times of the Patriarchs over a span of about 200 years, the last one occurring more than 400 years before the giving of the law through Moses. In Genesis 12, Abram’s wife Sarai is taken into the Egyptian Pharaoh’s palace after Abram does not disclose her marital status. God inflicts “serious diseases on Pharaoh and his whole household.” Pharaoh realizes it is because Sarai is actually Abram’s wife and tells him, [...] "What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> your wife? Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her for my wife? Now then, here is your wife; take her, and go." ...|$|E

Everett was on {{location}} in Tucson filming the 1967 movie, Return of the Gunfighter, {{at the time of}} their wedding. They had two daughters, Katherine and Shannon Everett. The couple remained married for 45 years until her death after a brain aneurysm on June 25, 2011. Everett credited his family with being a stabilizing force in his life, stating that even in the worst of times, Grant [...] "never threatened to leave. She would tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> there for me. If not for my family, I would have been in big trouble." [...] Grant noted his romanticism; he sent her so many flowers during their courtship that [...] "my balcony looked like a burial ground." [...] He also often wrote sentimental poems to Grant throughout their marriage, as well as to his daughters. The couple renewed their marriage vows every seven years.|$|E

6000|$|... "Sister," [...] Mr. Pengarth said, [...] "Juliet {{has come}} today {{to see me}} on business. In effect, {{she has come to}} remind <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> grown up." ...|$|R

60|$|Miss Haldin was shocked, but {{admitted}} to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not altogether surprised.|$|E
60|$|Later in {{the evening}} So-ta confided to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> soon to leave the tribe.|$|E
60|$|Well, {{every man}} to his taste. It did not {{certainly}} appear to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>SHE</b> <b>was</b> the martyr of the family.|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{the lady}} whom your little friend, the manicurist, {{sent me to}} visit," [...] Julien replied. [...] "Perhaps now you will tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> an ambassadress in disguise?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My aunt has {{informed}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{about to}} sign her Will," [...] I answered. [...] "She {{has been so}} good as {{to ask me to}} be one of the witnesses." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{told you}} to tell me? Nurse Inez, I do not believe your tale. If the Dona Margaret, my betrothed, were dead I should know it; but my heart tells <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> alive." ...|$|R
60|$|I drew {{a little}} nearer to her. It seemed to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> very pale, {{and there was}} trouble in her face.|$|E

6000|$|Captain Tremayne {{looked up}} with a rueful smile. [...] "I thought you boasted that you never forced a confidence." [...] And then he looked away. [...] "Sylvia Armytage tells <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{thinking}} of returning to England." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The idea doesn't {{appeal to}} either of us," [...] he assured her. [...] "Lady Mary has just confided to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> in love with some one else, and I have made a similar {{confession}} to her." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It struck <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> rather nervy," [...] Hunterleys told them. [...] "One of {{you ought}} to look after her {{for an hour or}} two to-morrow." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, gentlemen, {{you have}} the drop on me this time. I seem to have knocked up against {{something}} hard. But I came here in answer to a letter from Mrs. Hilton Cubitt.

6000|$|London, January 27.--Short as it is, I {{looked at}} Stella's letter {{again and again}} on the journey. The tone of the closing {{sentences}} is still studiously cold.

6000|$|... "Oh, Mac! Annabel {{has just}} confided to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> engaged to Fun See!

6000|$|... "Is it not sad? And that eldest girl is so nice! They tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> perfect,--not only in beauty, but in {{manners and}} accomplishments.

6000|$|... "At last! at last!" [...] {{she murmured}} to herself, as though forgetful of my presence. Then {{her eyes closed}} and her lips moved softly. It seemed to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> praying.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{meant that}} anybody {{could see that}} she came from somewhere out in the wilds. As a matter of fact, Bill tells <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> brought up in Snake Bite, Michigan." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It is the eye, Terence. I can't {{say that}} I {{have been much}} at sea myself, except on that voyage out and home; but I have an eye for ships, and can see their good points at a glance. You can take it from <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> a {{wonderful}} vessel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To have {{attracted}}, you mean, as {{you tell}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> dead," [...] he answered; and, seeing her mistake, Inez bit her lip. [...] "But," [...] he went on, [...] "I {{was going to}} add, though it may have no value for you, that you have attracted me as your true friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can {{you have}} learnt {{to care for}} any one else?" [...] she muttered. [...] "There were no women in Africa.
