2500|$|Stimulation of the periaqueductal gray {{matter of}} the {{midbrain}} activates enkephalin-releasing neurons that project to the raphe nuclei in the brainstem. 5-HT (serotonin) released from the raphe nuclei descends to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord where it forms excitatory connections with the [...] "inhibitory interneurons" [...] located in Laminae II (aka the substantia gelatinosa). When activated, these interneurons release either enkephalin or dynorphin (endogenous opioid neurotransmitters), which bind to mu opioid receptors on the axons of incoming C and A-delta fibers carrying pain signals from nociceptors activated in the periphery. The activation of the <b>mu-opioid</b> <b>receptor</b> inhibits the release of substance P from these incoming first-order neurons and, in turn, inhibits the activation of the second-order neuron {{that is responsible for}} transmitting the pain signal up the spinothalamic tract to the ventroposteriolateral nucleus (VPL) of the thalamus. The nociceptive signal was inhibited before it was able to reach the cortical areas that interpret the signal as [...] "pain" [...] (such as the anterior cingulate). This is sometimes referred to as the Gate control theory of pain and is supported by the fact that electrical stimulation of the PAG results in immediate and profound analgesia. The periaqueductal gray is also activated by viewing distressing images associated with pain.|$|E

40|$|Opioid receptors in the ventral tegmental area, {{predominantly}} the <b>mu-opioid</b> <b>receptors,</b> {{have been}} suggested to modulate reinforcement sensitivity for both opioid and non-opioid drugs of abuse. The present {{study was conducted to}} study signal transduction proteins, which may mediate the functioning of <b>mu-opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> in the neurons of the ventral tegmental area. Therefore, brain slices of the ventral tegmental area were exposed in vitro to the specific mu-opioid agonist fentanyl and immunohistochemically stained for four different activated proteins using phospho-specific antibodies. Fentanyl dose-dependently activated extracellular signal-regulated protein in brain slices of the ventral tegmental area. This activation was reversible with naloxone. Furthermore, naloxone itself also activated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase. Under the present conditions fentanyl did not affect extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1 and 2, Stat and cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein activity. The direct activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase in ventral tegmental area slices by the mu-opioid agonist fentanyl may suggest a role of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase in reward processes.

40|$|Transient {{forebrain}} ischemia induces specific {{changes in}} several neurochemical markers in the dorsolateral striatum. In the present paper, the density {{and distribution of}} mu and sigma-opioid receptors were analyzed in rat striatum 7 days after 30 min forebrain ischemia using the 4 -vessel occlusion model.

Moreover, the density of sigma-opioid receptors and of the diffuse <b>mu-opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> was also affected (30 % decrease) in the ventromedial striatum, an area which is substantially spared by the ischemic lesion. In contrast, the striatal patches of <b>mu-opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> were not affected in the ventromedial striatum and were preserved to a large extent in the area of lesion, although their area and receptor density resulted markedly reduced.

50|$|Alcohol {{activates}} {{endogenous opioid}} receptors, potentiating dopamine release {{which increases the}} rewarding effects of alcohol. To that end, the A118G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the <b>mu-opioid</b> <b>receptor</b> gene (OPRM1), has garnered much interest as a potential moderator of SR. Numerous laboratory {{studies have demonstrated that}} G-allele carriers experience the stimulating, hedonic effects of alcohol more strongly than A homozygotes. However, a study of non-treatment seeking participants with alcohol dependence found that A homozygotes experienced more stimulation than G carriers, and a study of heavy drinkers reported no differences in SR between OPRM1 genotype. These mixed findings may stem from differences in alcohol use severity among samples, as the allostatic model of addiction contends that individuals shift from reward to relief drinking as alcohol use disorder progresses. Thus, it is possible that social drinkers and individuals with mild alcohol use disorder may experience the hedonic effects of alcohol as most salient while individuals with more severe alcohol use disorder may consume alcohol for its negative reinforcing properties (i.e., to reduce withdrawal symptoms). The use of retrospective, instead of real time, self-reports of SR as well as differences in ethnicities of samples may further contribute to discrepancies in studies exploring the effects of the OPRM1 gene and SR. Taken together, the literature pertaining to the expression of SR by OPRM1 genotype suggests that the A118G SNP of the OPRM1 gene is associated with enhanced sensitivity to the stimulating, but not sedative, effects of alcohol.|$|E
50|$|One notable {{example of}} drug {{repurposing}} {{is taking the}} partial <b>mu-opioid</b> <b>receptor</b> agonist buprenorphine - which has been prescribed for control of moderate pain for decades in low dosages {{in the form of}} Temgesic 200mcg sublingual tablets, Buprenex 300mcg/mL ampoules - and marketing a high-dosage formulation (Subutex 2 mg and 8 mg) for the interruption and maintenance of heroin and other opioid addictions, which it has proven very beneficial for, with over 200,000 people in the United States alone on buprenorphine maintenance. Some of the reasons for this are that the drug has a ceiling effect - higher doses do not cause further activation of opioid receptors - and a very long half-life in >2 mg dosages. It also has an extremely high binding affinity for opioid receptors, which keeps the drug from being displaced by opioids like Dilaudid, heroin, morphine, and oxycodone, with the result that a user maintained on it can not get high no matter what dosage taken of most opioids. The only opioids that may be able to break through the buprenorphine blockade (which are required in an acute care setting if a buprenorphine patient requires pain relief, as no standard opioids are strong enough) - drugs with similar or higher binding affinities to buprenorphine itself - are the fentanil-class opioids, and the Bentley-series opioids (cf. etorphine, dihydroetorphine), which are rarely primary drugs of abuse and not often found on the streets. Buprenorphine itself is a modified Bentley-series opioid.|$|E
30|$|Introduction Tramadol poisonings are {{significantly}} increasing {{due to the}} increase in prescriptions since dextropropoxyphene banning from the European market in 2011. Tramadol-related analgesic effects are mediated by its antagonist activity on the norepinephrine and serotonin transporters in addition to the agonist activity of its major active metabolite M 1 on the <b>mu-opioid</b> <b>receptors.</b> Thus, tramadol overdose may result in various toxicities including central nervous system depression, seizures and serotonin syndrome. The relative prevalence of each of these complications is debated. We aimed (1) to describe the clinical features in tramadol-poisoned patients and (2) to study the prognostic value of the plasma concentration of tramadol and its metabolites on ICU admission.|$|R
40|$|There is {{confusion}} in the literature concerning the relative agonist efficacy of methadone at <b>mu-opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> (MOPrs). Here, we confirm that methadone is a full agonist in guanosine 5 '-O-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP gamma S) binding studies. Methadone, however, seems to have low efficacy in studies of MOPr activation of G-protein-gated potassium (GIRK) channels, but this is because it directly inhibits the GIRK channels. Methadone also inhibits alpha(2) -adrenoceptor-activated GIRK channels. Methadone is not a specific GIRK channel blocker. It also inhibits small conductance Ca 2 +-activated K+ (SK 2) channels. We conclude that methadone is a full agonist at MOPrs that, as we and others have shown, induces MOPr desensitization and internalization...|$|R
40|$|Agonists of <b>mu-opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> are {{currently}} {{used in the}} management of cancer pain. However, several data suggest that the analgesic effect of morphine can diminish during the development of experimental tumors. By using a thermal test, we have studied whether the analgesic effect evoked by morphine is altered in mice bearing two painful bone tumors. The analgesic effect evoked by systemic morphine remained unaltered after the intratibial inoculation of B 16 -F 10 melanoma cells and was potentiated after the inoculation of NCTC 2472 osteosarcoma cells. Although the number of spinal <b>mu-opioid</b> <b>receptors</b> measured by western blot studies was not augmented in osteosarcoma-bearing mice, the analgesia evoked by intrathecal (i. t.) morphine was also enhanced. The analgesic response produced by the spinal administration of the Gi/o protein activator mastoparan was amplified, whereas the analgesic response evoked by the i. t. administration of the N-type calcium channel blocker ?-conotoxin remained unaltered. The efficacy of the GIRK channel blocker tertiapin-Q to antagonize the analgesic effect produced by a maximal dose of morphine was also increased in osteosarcoma-bearing mice. Our results seem to indicate that the analgesic effect of morphine on thermal nociception can be enhanced in response to the development of particular bone tumors in mice, being this potentiation probably related to a greater efficacy of the transduction system driven by Gi/o proteins and GIRK channels.
