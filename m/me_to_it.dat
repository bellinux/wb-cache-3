The sequel would be {{produced}} by Spielberg and directed by Jackson. Kathleen Kennedy said the script might be done by February or March 2012 and motion-captured in summer 2012, so that the movie would be on track to be released by Christmas 2014 or mid-2015. In February 2012, Spielberg {{said that a}} story outline for the sequel had been completed. In December 2012, Jackson said that the Tintin schedule was to shoot performance-capture in 2013, aiming for a release in 2015. On 12 March 2013, Spielberg said, [...] "Don't hold <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> but we're hoping the film will come out around Christmas-time in 2015. We know which books we're making, we can't share that now but we're combining two books which were always intended to be combined by Herge." ...|$|E
2500|$|Explaining {{the concept}} of the film, Lopez stated: [...] "There's twists and turns and it's {{exciting}} [...] but it also has a message, which is what attracted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> in the first place, which is an empowering thing." [...] Describing its message, she said [...] " [...] you're in these negative situations, negative relationships, whatever, you can get out [...] The power to get out of those things is always within yourself. That's the message of the movie." [...] When Lopez read the script, she knew she was [...] "going to have to do [...] whole sequence at the end" [...] which featured an act that required her to [...] "become a believable lean, mean fighting machine." [...] Lopez then thought she should learn T'ai Chi or Tae Kwon Do, but was worried about learning it at an expert level {{in a short period of}} time. Her personal trainer then suggested that she study Krav Maga, the [...] "official self-defense system of the Israeli Defense Forces which has recently become trendy in the States. The fighting style focuses on combating realistic scenarios with moves that are based on common, instinctual reactions", according to MTV News. Talking about the system, Lopez said: [...] " [...] levels out the playing field between men and women [...] Where it doesn't matter how big or tall or strong you are. You can actually maneuver around that. It's about getting out of the way, counter attacking and using whatever you can to get the upper hand." ...|$|E

5000|$|According to the 9/11 Commission Report, {{after the}} plane's voice data {{recorder}} was recovered, it revealed pounding and crashing sounds against the cockpit door and shouts and screams in English. [...] "Let's get them!" [...] a passenger cries. A hijacker shouts, [...] "Allahu akbar". Jarrah repeatedly pitched {{the plane to}} knock passengers off their feet, but the passengers continued their assault and at 10:02:17, a male passenger said, [...] "Turn it up!" [...] A second later, a hijacker said, [...] "Pull it down! Pull it down!" [...] At 10:02:33, Jarrah was heard to plead, [...] "Hey! Hey! Give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> me." [...] The plane crashed into an empty field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania at 580 miles an hour, killing everyone on board. The plane was twenty minutes of flying time away from its suspected target, the White House or the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. According to Vice President Dick Cheney, President George W. Bush had given the order to shoot the plane down had it continued its path to Washington.|$|R
5000|$|The cockpit voice {{recorder}} captured the sounds of crashing, screaming, and the shattering of glass and plates. Three times {{in a period of}} five seconds there were shouts of pain or distress from a hijacker outside the cockpit, suggesting a hijacker that was standing guard outside the cockpit was being attacked by the passengers. Jarrah stabilized the plane at 10:00:03. Five seconds later, he asked, [...] "Is that it? Shall we finish it off?" [...] Another hijacker responded, [...] "No. Not yet. When they all come, we finish it off." [...] Jarrah once again pitched the airplane up and down. A passenger in the background cried, [...] "In the cockpit. If we don't, we'll die" [...] at 10:00:25. Sixteen seconds later, another passenger, identified as Tom Burnett, yelled, [...] "Roll it!", possibly referring to using the food cart. The {{voice recorder}} did record the sound of the passengers using the food cart as a battering ram against the cockpit door. Jarrah ceased the violent maneuvers at 10:01:00 and recited the takbir several times. He then asked another hijacker, [...] "Is that it? I mean, shall we put it down?" [...] The other hijacker responded, [...] "Yes, put it in it, and pull it down." [...] The passengers continued their assault and at 10:02:17, a male passenger said, [...] "Turn it up!" [...] A second later, a hijacker said, [...] "Pull it down! Pull it down!" [...] At 10:02:33, Jarrah was heard to plead, [...] "Hey! Hey!

5000|$|At {{least two}} of the {{cellphone}} calls made by passengers indicate that all the hijackers they saw were wearing red bandannas, and indicated that one of the men, believed to be either Ahmed al-Haznawi or Ahmed al-Nami, had a box tied around his torso, and claimed there was a bomb inside. Passengers on the plane had learned the fates of the other hijacked planes through telephone calls; some decided to act, fearing their plane, too, would too be used as a missile. A passenger uprising foiled the terrorists' plans, but failed to save the plane. According to the August 8, 2003, analysis of the plane's cockpit recording by the United States investigators, a group of passengers tried to break into the cockpit. To knock them off balance, Jarrah rolled the plane to the left and right. When this failed, he then pitched the nose forward and back. Jarrah stabilized the plane at 10:00:03. Five seconds later, he asked, [...] "Is that it? Shall we finish it off?" [...] Another hijacker responded, [...] "No. Not yet. When they all come, we finish it off." [...] The voice recorder did record the sound of the passengers using the food cart as a battering ram against the cockpit door.
