40|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>sulfate</b> can be {{recovered}} from a dilute solution by concentrating it by conventional water treatment techniques like reverse osmosis and electrodialysis; however, those processes also concentrate impurities like arsenic.

40|$|The {{research}} made in {{the present}} PhD Thesis entitled “Crystallization and dissolution study of electrolyte salts”. The objective of the dissertation concerned both crystallization and dissolution processes of soluble <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate</b> and insoluble calcium carbonate electrolyte salts approached by different experimental aspects but directly connected to environmental and scientific issues. Salt crystallization is an important cause for the weathering and damage of historical and cultural heritage artifacts and ornamental stones. Soluble salts (i. e. <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate,</b> magnesium <b>sulfate,</b> <b>sodium</b> chloride) have also a damaging and fateful impact on civil engineering structures of roads and building foundations. Most damaging salt for such built frameworks is proven to be <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate</b> salt. Only {{when we have a}} better understanding of <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate</b> crystallization in an unconstrained fluid medium can we progress to a study of <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate</b> crystallization in porous building materials. At the beginning of this study batch crystallization experiments of <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate</b> salt were conducted. Additionally potential organic inhibitors (i. e. organophosphonate, polyacrylates) were tested in the same batch experimental system. Popular and applicable limestone building material is of uniform composition consisting mainly calcium (calcitic material). Granada’s calcarenite has been selected as one of the target material to study. This natural stone is representative of the building material utilized in construction material monuments and susceptible to salt crystallization. In situ AFM experiments of both calcite crystal growth and dissolution were performed in the presence of different electrolyte solutions (i. e. <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate</b> and <b>sodium</b> fluoride). Nanoscale phenomena during the growth of solid solutions on calcite surfaces were performed in the presence of <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate</b> electrolyte solutions. Further molecular-scale surface processes during both growth and dissolution of calcite in the presence of sodium fluoride electrolyte solutions were carried out. In all cases significant kinetic data and reaction mechanisms were extracted. Accelerated degradation of Granada’s limestone and Czech sandstone experiments were executed. Tested materials were exposed and impregnated in concentrated solutions of soluble salts (i. e. <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate,</b> magnesium <b>sulfate</b> and <b>sodium</b> chloride). Immersed limestone type material showed susceptibility to <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate</b> and sandstone type material to sodium chloride salt solution. Different pre-treatments of limestone specimens with organophosphonate compounds resulted in limiting material damage from <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate</b> influence. The use of such organic compounds may direct towards a potential implication of conserving building frameworks. Finally suspended limestone rods were subjected to <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate</b> spray chamber. Pre-treatment of limestone rods with organophosphonate compounds were completed. Again applications of organophosphonate compounds to exposure of limestone material in salt spray chamber may work towards a case of preventing porous material from salt damage and protect building stones. ...|$|R
40|$|Borax {{has been}} {{identified}} as a possible crystallization modifier for <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate.</b> Understanding the effect of borax on factors influencing transport and crystallization kinetics of <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate</b> helps to clarify how this modifier might limit crystallization damage. It has been observed that the addition of borax to <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate</b> solutions has no influence on the wetting properties (contact angle on glass, surface tension, or evaporation rate) and therefore will not influence solution transport. Additionally, the influence of borax on the crystallization kinetics of <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate</b> was studied under controlled environmental conditions. This was carried out in mixtures in glass microcapillaries, and sequentially in droplets on glass plates. Under the here studied precipitation conditions, the addition of borax has no influence on the supersaturation ratio at the onset of crystallization, but it significantly affects the crystallization pattern of anhydrous <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate</b> crystals (thenardite). Using RAMAN spectroscopy, two different hydrates of borax were identified after precipitation, depending on the initial concentration of the solution. Each hydrate has a different effect on the subsequent crystallization of <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate.</b> The decahydrate polymorph of borax leads to the precipitation of hydrated <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate</b> crystals (mirabilite) and the pentahydrate form favors the precipitation of the anhydrous <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate</b> crystals (thenardite) with an altered crystal habit. Using X-ray diffraction, overdevelopment of the (111), (131), (222) and (153) faces of thenardite was identified. Additionally, the ratios between several peaks are reversed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the mechanical and microstructural properties of Class F fly ash based geopolymer containing <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate</b> as an additive. <b>Sodium</b> <b>sulfate</b> was used as an chemical additive at the dosage levels of 0, 2, 4, and 6 wt% of fly ash. Sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate solutions were used to activate fly ash. The compressive strengths of geopolymer pastes were measured at the age of 28 days. The microstructures of the geopolymer pastes were examined using XRD, MIP and SEM tests. The additions of 2 wt% and 4 wt% <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate</b> produced geopolymers with high strength, while increasing the dosage of levels to 6 % resulted in almost no changes in strength, comparing with the control geopolymer. The optimum increase in strength was obtained with the addition of 4 wt% <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate.</b> As the amount of <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate</b> is increased, no additional crystalline phase was detected and no change of amorphous phase indicated despite the change in the strength development. The increase in the strength was due to the change of pore size distribution in samples. As addition of <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate</b> altered the morphologies of reactive productions and Si/Al ratios of the reaction products, the strengths were thus affected. It was found that the strengths of geopolymer were larger for lower Si/Al ratios of reaction products formed in samples. The optimal amount of <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate</b> in the fly ash based geopolymer helps to improve mechanical properties of the geopolymer, on the other hand, the high percentage of <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate</b> could exist as an impurity in the geopolymer and hinder the geopolymer reaction. clos...|$|R
