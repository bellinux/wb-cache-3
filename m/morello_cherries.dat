60|$|The {{situation}} had in it enough spice {{for all of}} us. We welcomed him with alacrity. The cards were cut, and it fell to his Grace to deal, which he did very prettily, despite his heavy hands. He drew Charles Fox, and they won steadily. The conversation between deals was anywhere; on the virtue of <b>Morello</b> <b>cherries</b> for the gout, to which his Grace was already subject; on Mr. Fox's Ariel, and why he had not carried Sandwich's cup at Newmarket; on the advisability of putting three-year-olds on the track; in short, on a dozen small topics of the kind. At length, when Comyn and I had lost some fifty pounds between us, Chartersea threw down the cards.|$|E

5000|$|In Chile, aguardiente is an {{alcoholic}} beverage of 45% and higher alcohol content by volume (beverages with over 55% alcohol content by volume are illegal). It is made, like Italian grappa, by distilling the grape residue, primarily the skins and pulp (...) plus the stems (...) and seeds, {{left over from}} winemaking after pressing the grapes. It is used to make several other flavored liquors, such as the murtado or [...] (using sun dried murtilla, an orange-reddish wild rose fruit), the [...] (soaking sun-dried <b>morello</b> <b>cherries)</b> and licor de oro (flavored with saffron and lemon peel). Dried mint, peeled walnuts, almonds, and other aromatic herbs are also used to flavor the aguardiente. It is mainly consumed by itself, or as a base to make cola de mono (monkey tail).|$|E
50|$|The tree {{is smaller}} than the sweet cherry (growing to a height of 4-10 m), has twiggy branches, and its crimson-to-near-black {{cherries}} are borne upon shorter stalks. There are several varieties of the sour cherry: the dark-red <b>morello</b> <b>cherry</b> and the lighter-red varieties including the amarelle cherry, and the popular Montmorency cherry. The Montmorency cherry {{is the most popular}} type of sour cherry. The reason for its popularity is its use in baking and recipe creation. including cherry pies, cherry desserts and other cherry-based recipes.|$|R
50|$|Before the Second World War {{there were}} more than fifty cultivars of sour cherry in {{cultivation}} in England; today, however, few are grown commercially, and despite the continuation of named cultivars such as 'Kentish Red', 'Amarelles', 'Griottes' and 'Flemish', only the generic Morello is offered by most nurseries. This is a late-flowering variety, and thus misses more frosts than its sweet counterpart and is therefore a more reliable cropper. The <b>Morello</b> <b>cherry</b> ripens in mid to late summer, toward the end of August in southern England. It is self-fertile, and would be a good pollenizer for other varieties if it did not flower so late in the season.|$|R
50|$|Sour {{cherries}} require similar cultivation {{conditions to}} pears, that is, they prefer a rich, well-drained, moist soil, although they demand more nitrogen and water than sweet cherries. Trees will do badly if waterlogged, but have greater tolerance of poor drainage than sweet varieties. As with sweet <b>cherries,</b> <b>Morellos</b> are traditionally cultivated by budding onto strong growing rootstocks, which produce trees {{too large for}} most gardens, although newer dwarfing rootstocks such as Colt and Gisella are now available. During spring, flowers should be protected, and trees weeded, mulched and sprayed with natural seaweed solution. This is also the time when any required pruning should be carried out (note that cherries should not be pruned during the dormant winter months). <b>Morello</b> <b>cherry</b> trees fruit on younger wood than sweet varieties, and thus can be pruned harder. They are usually grown as standards, but can be fan trained, cropping well even on cold walls, or grown as low bushes.|$|R
5000|$|Cherry {{leaf spot}} is a fungal disease which infects {{cherries}} and plums. Sweet and sour cherries {{are susceptible to}} the disease; however leaf spot is much more prevalent in sour cherries. The variety of sour cherries {{that is the most}} susceptible are the English <b>Morello</b> <b>cherries.</b> This is considered a serious disease in the Midwest, New England states, and Canada. It has also been estimated to infect 80 percent of orchards in the Eastern states. [...] It must be controlled yearly to avoid a significant loss of the crop. If not controlled properly, the disease can dramatically reduce yields by nearly 100 percent. [...] The disease is also known as “yellow leaf” or “shothole disease” to cherry growers due to the characteristic yellowing leaves and shot holes present in the leaves upon severe infection.|$|E
50|$|Both borders have unique {{attributes}} serving {{very different}} purposes. The east-facing border boasts 150 m of length and features a curved inline {{to the northern}} end of the wall as it adjoins to the Head Gardeners Cottage. This border is significant in many respects because of its orientation to both the Sun and its immediate environment. Currently this border houses an eclectic mixture of hardy shrubs and delicate flowers with <b>Morello</b> <b>cherries,</b> plums and heritage roses fighting for superiority against the wall. The south-facing border extends {{from the end of the}} old Vinery to the north eastern corner of the gardens. Traditionally this wall is mainly used for growing exotic fruits, including peaches, nectarines, apricots and pears. In 2007 it was extended to border out its full depth, unlike the east-facing border a mixture of flowers and vegetables are grown here. Curiously, the leafy plants that grow against the wall, known as Echium, are native to North Africa and are only known to grow on the extreme south-west tip of Cornwall and nowhere else in the UK.|$|E
50|$|Morellino di Scansano DOCG is an Italian {{red wine}} {{made in the}} hilly environs of the village of Scansano, GR, in the Maremma region of coastal Tuscany, which has an ancient but obscure {{tradition}} of winemaking. Morellino is the local name for the Sangiovese grape variety. Many {{people think that the}} name Morellino comes from morello (brown), the colour of the region's horses. The name may also come from the <b>morello</b> <b>cherry,</b> a dark red cherry with great tartness and acidity. The wine, which was granted DOC status in 1978, then upgraded to DOCG status beginning with the 2007 vintage, is made from at least 85% Sangiovese, which is also the basis of the Tuscan wines Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino, and Vino Nobile di Montepulciano. The remaining 15% can comprise any non-aromatic black grape varieties included in a list made and periodically updated by Tuscan wine authorities.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{content of}} {{potentially}} essential and toxic elements: chromium, manganese, iron, copper, nickel, cadmium and arsenic in Bulgarian fruits such as aronia, <b>morello,</b> <b>cherry,</b> raspberry, nectarine peach, apple type „akane” and pear type „early gold” were investigated. By using the ICP-MS {{we found that}} - 1 - 1 - 1 raspberry has the highest content of iron (4635. 9 ± 53. 2 μg kg), manganese (5690. 9 ± 31. 7 μg kg) and chromium (150. 2 ± 2. 5 μg kg), while the richest in - 1 copper is the nectarine (887. 5 ± 31. 19 μg kg). The content of toxic elements (nickel, cadmium and arsenic) is in amount significantly below the permissible standards. Single ANOVA and subsequent Dunkan's test were used to define the fruit and to estimate the significance of chemical elements. The test for multidirectional comparisons indicated that for five of the investigated seven elements: iron, copper, nickel, cadmium, and arsenic the fruits are statistically distinguishable According to hierarchical cluster analysis the fruits are into one cluster...|$|R

40|$|Morphological {{variation}} among 78 local {{races of}} sour cherry (Prunus cerasus L.) in the Nordic Gene Bank's Prunus clone archive in Pälkäne in Southwestern Finland was examined. Each tree was described using 42 characteristics. On {{the basis of}} fruit characteristics, 32 samples were classified as morellos, 40 samples as amarelles, and 5 samples distinct from the other amarelles are proposed to be called Rymättylä-type cherries. One sample {{was found to be}} Prunus avium. Amarelle type cherries proved to be more self compatible than <b>morello</b> type <b>cherries.</b> In order to find hardy sour cherry cultivars with fruits of good flavour and fit for cultivation in Nordic conditions, the most promising local races from each group were selected for a comparative trial. Additionally, some local races were selected for further use in plant breeding. In 1994 - 1996, an increasing amount of severe bacterial canker symptoms was observed in the clone achive...|$|R
