40|$|BACKGROUND: Fatty acid {{sugar esters}} {{are used as}} {{non-ionic}} surfactants in cosmetics, foodstuffs and pharmaceuticals. In particular, <b>monoesters</b> of xylitol have attracted industrial interest due to their outstanding biological activities. In this work, xylitol <b>monoesters</b> were obtained by chemoenzymatic synthesis, in which, first, xylitol was made soluble in organic solvent by chemo-protecting reaction, followed by enzymatic esterification reaction using different acyl donors. A commercial immobilized Candida antartica lipase was used as catalyst, and reactions with pure xylitol were carried out to generate data for comparison. RESULTS: t-BuOH {{was found to be}} the most suitable solvent to carry out esterification reactions with both pure and protected xylitol. The highest yields were obtained for reactions carried out with pure xylitol, but in this case by-products, such as di- and tri-esters isomers were formed, which required a multi-step purification process. For the systems with protected xylitol, conversions of 86 %, 58 % and 24 % were achieved using oleic, lauric and butyric acids, respectively. The structures of the <b>monoesters</b> were confirmed by (13) C- and (1) H-NMR and microanalysis. CONCLUSION: The chemoenzymatic synthesis of xylitol <b>monoesters</b> avoided laborious downstream processing when compared with reactions performed with pure xylitol. <b>Monoesters</b> production from protected xylitol was shown to be a practical, economical, and clean route for this process, allowing a simple separation, because there are no other products formed besides xylitol <b>monoesters</b> and residual xylitol.

These were similar to concentrations reported for other populations using spot urine specimens. Phthalate levels did not differ between the two sampling days. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the concentrations on the 2 days was 0. 8 for mBP, 0. 7 for mEHP, 0. 6 for mEP, and 0. 5 for mBzP.

40|$|In tundra, {{phosphorus}} (P) is {{an important}} macronutrient for plants and microorganisms. A major fraction of P exists as organic compounds in the topsoil which can be mineralized to bioavailable inorganic P. Since mineralization is positively related to temperature, climate warming {{is likely to increase}} P bioavailability but the extend of these changes may also depend on vegetation cover and soil properties. I assessed organic and inorganic P concentrations across an elevation and vegetation gradient in northern Sweden using one dimensional (1 D) solution 31 P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. I hypothesized that concentration of labile soil P will decrease with increasing elevation (decreasing temperature) and that soils with meadow vegetation will contain higher concentrations of labile P than heath soils. Concentration of labile P in the form of Resin-P and polyphosphates decreased with elevation whereas less labile orthophosphate <b>monoesters</b> increased. Across vegetation types, polyphosphates were more abundant in heath and meadow contained higher concentrations of <b>monoesters.</b> The inverse response of Resin-P and <b>monoesters</b> to elevation may be best explained by lowered organic P mineralization in colder climate. High concentrations of polyphosphates at the lowest elevation may indicate an increased presence of fungal communities associated with mountain birch forest. Heath seemed to be more dominated by fungal communities than meadow and higher concentration of <b>monoesters</b> in meadow indicated a higher soil sorption capacity. In a broader view, the results may suggest that a warmer climate increases mineralization of organic P in form of orthophosphate <b>monoesters</b> to more labile P forms.
