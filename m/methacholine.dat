Acute exposure to high concentrations of chlorine gas induces pathological and functional changes in the lungs of rodents. Histological changes consist of epithelial necrosis and detachment, increase in the area of smooth muscle, epithelial regeneration and mucous cell hyperplasia. Most of these abnormalities resolve with time. Functional changes (increased RL and/or bronchial responsiveness to inhaled <b>methacholine)</b> last for mean intervals of 3 and 7 days after exposure, but can persist up to 30 and 90 days, respectively. The functional changes are related to the overall abnormal airway epithelial damage and there is a significant correlation between RL and bronchoalveolar lavage ( [...] BAL) neutrophilia. Bleomycin is an antineoplastic antibiotic drug isolated in 1966 from the actinomycete Streptomyces verticillus. Bleomycin forms a complex with oxygen and metals such as Fe2+, leading to the production of oxygen radicals, DNA breaks, and ultimately cell death. Doxycycline driven overexpression of TGF β1 in the lungs of transgenic mice result in a time-dependent inflammatory response characterized by massive infiltration of F4/80+ monocytic/macrophage-like cells and a wave of apoptotic pulmonary cell death. Mice that survive this initial onslaught go on to demonstrate an increase in lung collagen content, and decreased lung compliance. A large animal model of ALI is the ovine model of body surface burn + heated smoke inhalation. It has been established that combined burn and smoke inhalation injury impairs hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), the vasoconstrictive response to hypoxia, thereby mismatching ventilation with perfusion. Gas exchange is affected by increases in the dispersion of both alveolar ventilation and cardiac output because bronchial and vascular functions are altered by injury-related factors, such as the effects of inflammatory mediators on airway and vascular smooth muscle tone. As a rule of thumb, all these models are characterized by high mortality, inflammation of the airways and pulmonary parenchyma, edema and flooding of the alveolar spaces by a proteinaceous exudate, sloughing of the airway and pulmonary epithelium, scarring and transition to airway and pulmonary remodeling.|$|E
50|$|<b>Methacholine</b> is {{primarily}} used to diagnose bronchial hyperreactivity, {{which is the}} hallmark of asthma and also occurs in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This is accomplished through the bronchial challenge test, or <b>methacholine</b> challenge, in which a subject inhales aerosolized <b>methacholine,</b> leading to bronchoconstriction. Other therapeutic uses are limited by its adverse cardiovascular effects, such as bradycardia and hypotension, which arise from its function as a cholinomimetic.|$|E
50|$|A {{bronchial}} {{challenge test}} {{is a medical}} test used {{to assist in the}} diagnosis of asthma. The patient breathes in nebulized <b>methacholine</b> or histamine. Thus the test may also be called a <b>methacholine</b> challenge test or histamine challenge test respectively. Both drugs provoke bronchoconstriction, or narrowing of the airways. Whereas histamine causes nasal and bronchial mucus secretion and bronchoconstriction via the H1 receptor, <b>methacholine</b> utilizes the M3 receptor for bronchoconstriction. The degree of narrowing can then be quantified by spirometry. People with pre-existing airway hyperreactivity, such as asthmatics, will react to lower doses of drug.|$|E

50|$|Bronchial hyperresponsiveness can be {{assessed}} with a bronchial challenge test. This most often uses products like <b>methacholine</b> or histamine. These chemicals trigger bronchospasm in normal individuals as well, but people with bronchial hyperresponsiveness have a lower threshold.|$|E

50|$|It {{is highly}} active {{at all of}} the muscarinic receptors, but has little effect on the nicotinic receptors. <b>Methacholine</b> has a charged {{quaternary}} amine structure, rendering it insoluble to lipid cell membranes.

50|$|It {{has been}} shown that GSNOR may have an {{important}} role in respiratory diseases such as asthma. GSNOR expression has been inversely correlated with s-nitrosothiol (SNO) levels in the alveolar lining fluid in the lung and with responsiveness to <b>methacholine</b> challenge in patients with mild asthma compared to normal subjects. Furthermore, there are lowered SNOs in tracheal irrigations in asthmatic children with respiratory failure in comparison to normal children undergoing elective surgery and NO species are elevated in asthma patients when exposed to antigen.|$|E
50|$|In a {{mouse model}} of ovalbumin-induced asthma, a {{selective}} EP3 agonist reduced airway cellularity, mucus, and bronchoconstriction responses to <b>methacholine.</b> In this model, EP33-deficient mice, upon ovalbumin challenge, exhibited worsened allergic inflammation {{as measured by}} increased airway eosinophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and pro-allergic cytokines (i.e. interleukin 4, interleukin 5, and interleukin 13) as compared to wild type mice. EP3 receptor-deficient mice and/or wild type mice treated with an EP3 receptor agonist are similarly protected from allergic responses in models of allergic conjunctivitis and contact hypersensitivity. Thus, EP3 appears to serve {{an important role in}} reducing allergic reactivity at least in mice.|$|E
50|$|As {{might be}} {{expected}} of an enzyme involved in regulating NO levels and signaling, pleiotropic effects are observed in GSNOR knockout models. Deleting the GSNOR gene from both yeast and mice increased the cellular levels of GSNO and nitrosylated proteins, and the yeast cells showed increased susceptibility to nitrosative stress. Null mice show increased levels of S-nitrosated proteins, increased beta adrenergic receptor numbers in lung and heart, diminished tachyphylaxis to β2-adrenergic receptor agonists, hyporesponsiveness to <b>methacholine</b> and allergen challenge and reduced infarct size after occlusion of the coronary artery. In addition, null mice show increased tissue damage and mortality following challenge with bacteria or endotoxin and are hypotensive under anesthesia yet normotensive in the conscious state. More related to its alcohol dehydrogenase activity, GSNOR null mice show a 30% reduction in the LD50 for formaldehyde and a decreased capacity to metabolize retinol, although {{it is clear from}} these studies that other pathways exist for the metabolism of these compounds.|$|E

The patient complains of additional symptoms, and Foreman determines that he is faking them. His alleged symptoms are the same as those of other patients, and the name he gave them was the same as the paramedic. Foreman thinks he might have Munchausens, but House thinks it might be a rare form of anterograde amnesia known as Giovannini mirror syndrome that causes a patient to mimic those around him. House suggests that they try to convince the patient that he is a doctor, since a mirror syndrome patient would be convinced, but a Munchausens patient would not. They go to one of Wilson's surgeries, and the patient acts like a doctor. Specifically, he acts like Wilson. Wilson later notes that mirror patients always mirror the most dominant person in the room, which means that Wilson was more dominant than House.

[...] Furthermore, human suffers of asthma exhibit increased levels of 13-HODE in their blood, sputum, and washings form their lung alveola (i.e. bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of BAL) and human eosinophils, which are implicated in contributing to human asthma, metabolize linoleic acid to 13-HODE (and 9-HODE) to a far greater extent than {{any other type of}} leukocyte. [...] The mechanism responsible for 13-HODE's impact on airway epithelial cells may involve its activation of the TRPV1 receptor (see previous section on TRPV1): this receptor is highly expressed in mouse and human airway epithelial cells and in Beas 2B human airway epithelial cells and, furthermore, suppression of TRPV1 expression as well as a TPRV1 receptor inhibitor (capsazepan) block mouse airway responses to 13(S)-HODE. [...] While much further work is needed, these pre-clinical studies allow that 13(S)-HODE, made at least in part by eosinophils and operating through TRPV1, may be responsible for the airways damage which occurs in the more severe forms of asthma and that pharmacological inhibitors of TRPV1 may eventually proved to be useful additions to the treatment of asthma.|$|E

In fifteen normal subjects a complete dose-response curve to <b>methacholine</b> was recorded by a tidal breathing method on three randomized days. On a separate day a complete histamine inhalation test was carried out. Each <b>methacholine</b> test was directly followed by double blind inhalation of the highest dose of either histamine or <b>methacholine,</b> or a dose of saline.

However, the response to the combined histamine and <b>methacholine</b> was not significantly larger than the maximal response to histamine alone.

40|$|Background <b>Methacholine</b> hyperresponsiveness is {{prevalent}} in elite athletes. Comparative studies have hitherto {{been limited to}} <b>methacholine,</b> eucapnic voluntary hyperpnoea and exercise. This study investigated airway responsiveness to these stimuli {{as well as to}} adenosine 5 '-monophosphate (AMP) and mannitol, in 58 cross-country ski athletes. Methods Exhaled nitric oxide concentration (FENO), spirometry and bronchial challenge in random order with <b>methacholine,</b> AMP and mannitol were consecutively performed on three study days in the autumn. Specific IgE to eight aeroallergens and a self-completed questionnaire about respiratory symptoms, allergy and asthmatic medication were also performed on day 1. Eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation (EVH) and field exercise tests were randomly performed in 33 of the skiers on two study days in the following winter. Results Of 25 (43 %) skiers with airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), 23, five and three skiers were hyperresponsive to <b>methacholine,</b> AMP and mannitol, respectively. <b>Methacholine</b> hyperresponsiveness was more {{prevalent in}} subjects without asthma-like symptoms. The FENO was not significantly different in skiers with and without <b>methacholine</b> hyperresponsiveness. Four of 14 skiers with and four of 19 skiers without <b>methacholine</b> hyperresponsiveness were hyperresponsive to EVH or exercise challenge. AHR to any stimulus was present in 16 asymptomatic and nine symptomatic skiers. Asthma-like symptoms were not correlated with AHR to any stimulus. Conclusions <b>Methacholine</b> hyperresponsiveness is more common in asymptomatic skiers and is a poor predictor of hyperresponsiveness to mannitol and hyperpnoea. The low prevalence of hyperresponsiveness to indirect stimuli may suggest differences in the pathogenesis of <b>methacholine</b> hyperresponsiveness in elite skiers and non-athletes...|$|E

His initial <b>methacholine</b> bronchial challenge test showed a negative response. The bronchoprovacation test with TDI showed an isolated immediate bronchoconstriction. The following <b>methacholine</b> bronchial challenge tests revealed that the bronchial hyperresponsiveness developed seven hours after the TDI challenge (<b>methacholine</b> PC 20 : 5. 1 mg/ml), progressed up until 24 hours, and returned to normal on the seventh day.

40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that maximal bronchoconstriction in humans in vivo {{is limited by the}} maximal contractility of airway smooth muscle by comparison of complete in vivo and in vitro dose-response curves to <b>methacholine</b> in 10 nonasthmatic subjects who were scheduled for thoracotomy because of malignancies. The provocative dose of <b>methacholine</b> that produced a 10 and 20 % decrease of baseline FEV 1 (PD 10, 20 FEV 1) and the maximal fall in FEV 1 (MFEV 1) at the response plateau to inhaled <b>methacholine</b> were determined prior to surgery. Small airway smooth muscle preparations, obtained from the 10 resected lung tissue specimens, were examined in vitro to determine the sensitivity (-log EC 50) and maximal isotonic shortening (Smax) to <b>methacholine.</b> In addition, the relaxation responses to the beta-agonist I-isoproterenol were measured. The degree of small airways disease (SAD) was examined histologically. Nine subjects showed a maximal response plateau to inhaled <b>methacholine</b> in vivo.

All airway smooth muscle preparations (n = 30) contracted to <b>methacholine</b> (-log EC 50, 5. 94 +/- 0. 09; Smax, 1320 +/- 219 micron) and relaxed to I-isoproterenol (-log EC 50, 7. 60 +/- 0. 11; maximal relaxation [Rmax], 87 +/- 3 %).

The next day HDM was inhaled, and 3 and 24 h later <b>methacholine</b> or AMP challenge was performed again. There {{were no significant differences}} in FEV 1 baseline values between any of the study days. PD 20 HDM, percentage decrease in FEV 1, and AUC for both the EAR and LAR were not significantly different in the <b>methacholine</b> and AMP studies. After HDM challenge, PC 20 <b>methacholine</b> decreased significantly from a geometric mean (+/- SEM) starting value of 1. 39 +/- 0. 63 mg/ml to 0. 30 +/- 0. 78 mg/ml (p 0. 05). No correlation between the decrease of the PC 20 AMP and the severity of the LAR could be demonstrated. The difference in decrease after HDM challenge between the PC 20 <b>methacholine</b> and the PC 20 AMP at 24 h was significant (p < 0. 05). We conclude that BHR, as measured with a direct (<b>methacholine)</b> and an indirect (AMP) stimulus, increases 3 h after HDM challenge. This increase is correlated with the severity of the LAR only if measured with <b>methacholine.</b> A significant increase in allergen-induced BHR at 24 h was measured with <b>methacholine,</b> whereas the PC 20 AMP had almost returned to prechallenge values.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} was to study in human bronchial smooth muscle (1) the relationship between <b>methacholine</b> and histamine-induced inositol phosphate (IP) production and contraction, (2) the influence of increasing concentrations of <b>methacholine</b> and histamine on the relaxation (pD 2 and Emax) by isoproterenol (functional antagonism), and (3) the relation between IP production by <b>methacholine</b> and histamine and the changes of pD 2 and Emax values of isoproterenol-induced relaxation. <b>Methacholine</b> and histamine were full agonists in contracting human bronchial smooth muscle, with pD 2 values of 6. 01 +/- 0. 18 and 6. 07 +/- 0. 04, respectively. With IP production, however, pD 2 values of 4. 90 +/- 0. 06 for <b>methacholine</b> and 5. 15 +/- 0. 16 for histamine were obtained, indicating a considerable reserve of PI metabolism for contraction. With increasing concentrations of histamine and <b>methacholine</b> (to 1 and 0. 1 mM, respectively), subsequently performed dose-relaxation curves with isoproterenol showed decreasing values of pD 2 (from 8. 25 +/- 0. 20 to 7. 28 +/- 0. 28) and Emax (from 100 % to 56. 7 +/- 12. 4 %). No differences were observed between <b>methacholine</b> and histamine in this respect. A significant correlation was found between IP production induced by the various concentrations of <b>methacholine</b> and histamine and the reduction of isoproterenol pD 2 and Emax values.

To determine whether a calibrated dosage of oral slow-release theophylline inhibits asthmatic reactions and the associated increase of airway responsiveness to <b>methacholine</b> induced by TDI, we examined six asthmatic subjects who developed a late or a dual asthmatic reaction after TDI inhalation challenge. We administered oral slow-release theophylline or placebo to each subject for 7 days according to a double-blind, randomized, cross-over study design. When the subjects received a placebo, TDI caused a late or a dual asthmatic reaction. When the subjects received theophylline, TDI caused significantly reduced late asthmatic reactions. Mean serum theophylline concentrations were within the therapeutic range. Theophylline neither modified the baseline airway responsiveness to <b>methacholine,</b> nor the increase of airway responsiveness to <b>methacholine</b> induced by TDI.

Provocative doses of <b>methacholine</b> causing a 15 % fall in PtcO 2 (PD 15 PtcO 2) or a 30 % fall in V̇maxFRC (PD 30 V̇maxFRC) were determined.  RESULTS—Large changes in V̇maxFRC were measured from T 1 to T 2 with a mean difference between measurements (T 2 —T 1) of 7 (113) ml/s and a 95 % range for a single determination for V̇maxFRC of 160 ml/s. The mean (SD) difference between pairs of PD 30 V̇maxFRC measurements was 0. 33 (1. 89) doubling doses with a 95 % range for a single determination of 2. 7 doubling doses. Repeatability of PD 15 PtcO 2 was similar. A change of 3. 7 doubling doses of <b>methacholine</b> measured on successive occasions represents a significant change.  CONCLUSIONS—Baseline V̇maxFRC values are highly variable in wheezy, symptom free infants. Using either V̇maxFRC or PtcO 2 as the outcome measure for <b>methacholine</b> challenges provided similar repeatability. A change of more than 3. 7 doubling doses of <b>methacholine</b> is required for clinical significance. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} if muscarinic receptor-stimulated {{activation of}} the PLC/PIP 2 second messenger pathway prior to irradiation increases the radiotolerance of rat salivary gland. Materials and methods: Rats were treated with pilocarpine, <b>methacholine,</b> reserpine, <b>methacholine</b> plus reserpine, or atropine prior to irradiation with a single dose of 15 Gy X-rays. Parotid and submandibular/sublingual saliva was collected 4 -days before and 1 - 30 days after irradiation. Lag phase, flow rate, amylase secretion, and salivary sodium and potassium concentration were measured. Results: Pretreatment with pilocarpine or <b>methacholine</b> resulted in an improvement of all measured functions of both glands. Pretreatment with reserpine {{had no effect on}} parotid gland function. Reserpine plus <b>methacholine</b> did not increase parotid gland function when compared with <b>methacholine</b> alone, indicating a purely muscarinic receptor stimulation as the initiator for the induced radioprotection. Pretreatment protective effects on submandibular gland function of reserpine plus <b>methacholine</b> were additive, indicating cooperation of muscarinic and alpha-adrenergic receptors. Atropine pretreatment slightly increased the radiation induced loss of salivary gland function. Conclusions: Preirradiation activation of PLC/PIP 2 second messenger pathway through stimulation of muscarinic receptors reduces the salivary gland radiosensitivity. The observed protection of salivary gland function may be of a secondary nature, implicating a cell conditioning after receptor stimulation of the PLC/PIP 2 pathway...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{increasing}} intravenous doses of theophylline and enprofylline, a new xanthine derivative, on bronchial responsiveness to <b>methacholine</b> was studied in eight asthmatic patients. <b>Methacholine</b> provocations {{were carried out}} on three days before and after increasing doses of theophylline, enprofylline, and placebo, a double blind study design being used. <b>Methacholine</b> responsiveness was determined as the provocative concentration of <b>methacholine</b> causing a fall of 20 % in FEV 1 (PC 20). The patients were characterised pharmacokinetically before the main study to provide an individual dosage scheme for each patient that would provide rapid steady state plasma concentration plateaus of 5, 10, and 15 mg/l for theophylline and 1. 25, 2. 5, and 3. 75 mg/l for enprofylline. Dose increments in the main study were given at 90 minute intervals. FEV 1 showed a small progressive decrease after placebo; it remained high in relation to placebo after both drugs and this effect was dose related. <b>Methacholine</b> PC 20 values decreased after placebo; mean values were higher after theophylline and enprofylline than after placebo (maximum difference 2. 0 and 1. 7 doubling doses of methacholine); the effect of both drugs were dose related. Thus enprofylline and theophylline when given intravenously cause a small dose related increase in FEV 1 and <b>methacholine</b> PC 20 when compared with placebo...|$|E
