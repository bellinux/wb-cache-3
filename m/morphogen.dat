5|$|Alan Turing, {{and later}} the {{mathematical}} biologist James Murray, described a mechanism that spontaneously creates spotted or striped patterns: a reaction-diffusion system. The cells of a young organism have genes that can be switched on by a chemical signal, a <b>morphogen,</b> resulting {{in the growth of}} a certain type of structure, say a darkly pigmented patch of skin. If the <b>morphogen</b> is present everywhere, the result is an even pigmentation, as in a black leopard. But if it is unevenly distributed, spots or stripes can result. Turing suggested that there could be feedback control of the production of the <b>morphogen</b> itself. This could cause continuous fluctuations in the amount of <b>morphogen</b> as it diffused around the body. A second mechanism is needed to create standing wave patterns (to result in spots or stripes): an inhibitor chemical that switches off production of the <b>morphogen,</b> and that itself diffuses through the body more quickly than the <b>morphogen,</b> resulting in an activator-inhibitor scheme. The Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction is a non-biological example of this kind of scheme, a chemical oscillator.|$|E
25|$|The {{concentration}} and time-dependent, cell-fate-determining activity of SHH in the ventral neural tube {{makes it a}} prime example of a <b>morphogen.</b> In vertebrates, SHH signaling in the ventral portion of the neural tube is most notably responsible for the induction of floor plate cells and motor neurons.|$|E
25|$|How the {{infinite}} variety {{of plant leaves}} is generated is a subject of intense research. Some common themes have emerged. One {{of the most significant}} is the involvement of KNOX genes in generating compound leaves, as in tomato (see above). But this again is not universal. For example, pea uses a different mechanism for doing the same thing. Mutations in genes affecting leaf curvature can also change leaf form, by changing the leaf from flat, to a crinky shape, like the shape of cabbage leaves. There also exist different <b>morphogen</b> gradients in a developing leaf which define the leaf's axis. Changes in these <b>morphogen</b> gradients may also affect the leaf form. Another very important class of regulators of leaf development are the microRNAs, whose role in this process has just begun to be documented. The coming years should see a rapid development in comparative studies on leaf development, with many EST sequences involved in the process coming online.|$|E
50|$|<b>Morphogens</b> {{are defined}} conceptually, not chemically, so simple {{chemicals}} such as retinoic acid may also act as <b>morphogens.</b>|$|R
40|$|Skeletal pattern {{formation}} in limb development depends on prechondrogenic condensation which prefigures the cartilage template. However, although <b>morphogens</b> such as TGF-βs and BMPs {{have been known}} to play essential roles in skeletal patterning, how the <b>morphogens</b> induce prechondrogenic cells to aggregate and determine patterns of cartilage elements has remained unclear. Our previous study reported that ATP oscillations are induced during chondrogenesis. This result suggests the possibility that ATP oscillations lead to the oscillatory secretion of <b>morphogens,</b> {{due to the fact that}} secretion process requires ATP. To examine the correlation between ATP oscillations and secretion levels of <b>morphogens,</b> we have developed perfusion culture-combined bioluminescence monitoring system to simultaneously monitor intracellular ATP levels and secretion levels. Using this system, we found that secretory activity oscillates in phase with ATP oscillations and that secretion levels of TGF-β 1 and BMP 2 oscillate during chondrogenesis. The oscillatory secretion of the <b>morphogens</b> would contribute to amplifying the fluctuation of the <b>morphogens,</b> underlie the spatial patterning of <b>morphogens,</b> and consequently lead to skeletal pattern formation...|$|R
50|$|Segmentation {{polarity}} {{occurs during}} {{the release of}} <b>morphogens,</b> which functions to differentiate patterns within sections. The development of a pattern depends on the gradients of these <b>morphogens.</b>|$|R
25|$|Of the hh homologues, SHH {{has been}} found to have the most {{critical}} roles in development, acting as a <b>morphogen</b> involved in patterning many systems, including the limb and midline structures in the brain, spinal cord, the thalamus by the zona limitans intrathalamica the lungs, and the teeth. Mutations in the human sonic hedgehog gene, SHH, cause holoprosencephaly type 3 HPE3 {{as a result of the}} loss of the ventral midline. Sonic hedgehog is secreted at the zone of polarizing activity, which is located on the posterior side of a limb bud in an embryo. The sonic hedgehog transcription pathway has also been linked to the formation of specific kinds of cancerous tumors, including the embryonic cerebellar tumor, and medulloblastoma, as well as the progression of Prostate Cancer tumours. For SHH to be expressed in the developing embryo limbs, a <b>morphogen</b> called fibroblast growth factors must be secreted from the apical ectodermal ridge.|$|E
25|$|Sonic {{hedgehog}} is one {{of three}} proteins in the mammalian signaling pathway family called hedgehog, the others being desert hedgehog (DHH) and Indian hedgehog (IHH). SHH is the best studied ligand of the hedgehog signaling pathway. It {{plays a key role in}} regulating vertebrate organogenesis, such as in the growth of digits on limbs and organization of the brain. Sonic hedgehog is the best established example of a <b>morphogen</b> as defined by Lewis Wolpert's French flag model—a molecule that diffuses to form a concentration gradient and has different effects on the cells of the developing embryo depending on its concentration. SHH remains important in the adult. It controls cell division of adult stem cells and has been implicated in the development of some cancers.|$|E
25|$|Members of the {{hedgehog}} family {{play key}} roles {{in a wide}} variety of developmental processes. One of the best studied examples is the action of Sonic hedgehog during development of the vertebrate limb. The classic experiments of Saunders and Gasseling in 1968 on the development of the chick limb bud formed the basis of the <b>morphogen</b> concept. They showed that identity of the digits in the chick limb was determined by a diffusible factor produced by the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA), a small region of tissue at the posterior margin of the limb. Mammalian development appeared to follow the same pattern. This diffusible factor was later shown to be Sonic hedgehog. However, precisely how SHH determines digit identity remained elusive until recently. The current model, proposed by Harfe et al., states that both the concentration and the time of exposure to SHH determines which digit the tissue will develop into in the mouse embryo (figure 6).|$|E
5000|$|Proposed {{mammalian}} <b>morphogens</b> include retinoic acid, sonic hedgehog (SHH), transforming {{growth factor}} beta (TGF-β)/bone morphogenic protein (BMP), and Wnt/beta-catenin. [...] <b>Morphogens</b> in Drosophila include decapentaplegic and hedgehog.|$|R
50|$|Some of the {{earliest}} and best-studied <b>morphogens</b> are transcription factors that diffuse within early Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) embryos. However, most <b>morphogens</b> are secreted proteins that signal between cells.|$|R

25|$|In {{multicellular}} animals {{the same}} principle has been put {{in the service of}} gene cascades that control body-shape. Each time a cell divides, two cells result which, although they contain the same genome in full, can differ in which genes are turned on and making proteins. Sometimes a 'self-sustaining feedback loop' ensures that a cell maintains its identity and passes it on. Less understood is the mechanism of epigenetics by which chromatin modification may provide cellular memory by blocking or allowing transcription. A major feature of multicellular animals is the use of <b>morphogen</b> gradients, which in effect provide a positioning system that tells a cell where in the body it is, and hence what sort of cell to become. A gene that is turned on in one cell may make a product that leaves the cell and diffuses through adjacent cells, entering them and turning on genes only when it is present above a certain threshold level. These cells are thus induced into a new fate, and may even generate other morphogens that signal back to the original cell. Over longer distances morphogens may use the active process of signal transduction. Such signalling controls embryogenesis, the building of a body plan from scratch through a series of sequential steps. They also control and maintain adult bodies through feedback processes, and the loss of such feedback because of a mutation can be responsible for the cell proliferation that is seen in cancer. In parallel with this process of building structure, the gene cascade turns on genes that make structural proteins that give each cell the physical properties it needs.|$|E
25|$|Astrocytes are macroglial {{cells in}} the central nervous system. Astrocytes are derived from {{heterogeneous}} populations of progenitor {{cells in the}} neuroepithelium of the developing central nervous system. There is remarkable similarity between the well known genetic mechanisms that specify the lineage of diverse neuron subtypes and that of macroglial cells. Just as with neuronal cell specification, canonical signaling factors like Sonic hedgehog (SHH), Fibroblast growth factor (FGFs), WNTs and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), provide positional information to developing macroglial cells through <b>morphogen</b> gradients along the dorsal–ventral, anterior–posterior and medial–lateral axes. The resultant patterning along the neuraxis leads to segmentation of the neuroepithelium into progenitor domains (p0, p1 p2, p3 and pMN) for distinct neuron types in the developing spinal cord. On the basis of several studies it is now believed that this model also applies to macroglial cell specification. Studies carried out by Hochstim and colleagues have demonstrated that three distinct populations of astrocytes arise from the p1, p2 and p3 domains. These subtypes of astrocytes can be identified {{on the basis of}} their expression of different transcription factors (PAX6, NKX6.1) and cell surface markers (reelin and SLIT1). The three populations of astrocyte subtypes which have been identified are 1) dorsally located VA1 astrocytes, derived from p1 domain, express PAX6 and reelin 2) ventrally located VA3 astrocytes, derived from p3, express NKX6.1 and SLIT1 and 3) and intermediate white-matter located VA2 astrocyte, derived from the p2 domain, which express PAX6, NKX6.1, reelin and SLIT1. After astrocyte specification has occurred in the developing CNS, it is believed that astrocyte precursors migrate to their final positions within the nervous system before the process of terminal differentiation occurs.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{embryonic}} spinal cord, a {{major source}} of polydendrocytes is the ventral ventricular zone of the pMN domain marked by the expression of the transcription factors Olig1 and Olig2 and the p3 domain that expresses Nkx2.2, which are induced by the <b>morphogen</b> Shh (sonic hedgehog). [...] Some polydendrocytes also arise from the dorsal ventricular zone. [...] In the forebrain, three regionally distinct sources have been shown to generate polydendrocytes sequentially: an early ventral source from the medial ganglionic eminence marked by Nkx2.1, followed by progenitor cells in the lateral ganglionic eminence marked by Gsh2, and finally the dorsal neocortical germinal zone marked by Emx1. [...] After the committed progenitor cells exit the germinal zones, they begin to express NG2 and Pdgfra and expand by local proliferation and migration and eventually occupy the entire CNS parenchyma. [...] Polydendrocytes continue to exist in the adult CNS and retain their proliferative ability throughout life.|$|E
40|$|Our {{knowledge}} about molecular mechanisms underlying axon guidance along the antero-posterior axis {{in contrast to}} the dorso-ventral axis of the developing nervous system is very limited. During the past two years in vitro and in vivo studies have indicated that <b>morphogens</b> have a role in longitudinal axon guidance. <b>Morphogens</b> are secreted proteins that act in a concentration-dependent manner on susceptible groups of precursor cells and induce their differentiation to a specific cell fate. Thus, gradients of <b>morphogens</b> are responsible for the appropriate patterning of the nervous system during early phases of neural development. Therefore, it was surprising to find that gradients of two of these <b>morphogens,</b> Wnt 4 and Shh, can be re-used for longitudinal axon guidance during later stages of nervous system development...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Morphogens</b> play a {{critical}} role in most aspects of development, including expansion and patterning of the central nervous system. Activating germline mutations in components of the Hedgehog and Wnt pathways have provided evidence for the important roles <b>morphogens</b> play in the genesis of brain tumors such as cerebellar medulloblastoma. In addition, aberrant expression of transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) superfamily members has been demonstrated to contribute to progression of malignant gliomas. This review summarizes our current knowledge about the roles of <b>morphogens</b> in central nervous system tumor...|$|R
30|$|In addition, <b>morphogens</b> such as GDNF or FGF 8 {{with a good}} {{solubility}} in saline have {{a chance}} to reach niche sites by diffusion (Figure  6.1). For <b>morphogens</b> such as BMP 4 or BMP 7, a therapeutic administration will be more difficult, since secreted BMPs are transported by restricted diffusion and interaction with extracellular matrix (Fig. 6.2). Thus, in this case, not by the therapeutic administration of a drug but by the local extracellular matrix within the niche is decided upon free accessibility to the related receptor. For <b>morphogens</b> such as Wnt 4, Wnt 5 a, Wnt 9 b, or Shh, an administration and action on the target cells becomes unpredictable. These <b>morphogens</b> are not soluble in saline solution and can bind optionally on extracellular matrix and on cell projections [74]. Transport of the mentioned <b>morphogens</b> is also thinkable along the plasma membrane and via tunneling nanotubes (Fig. 6.3) [127 – 129]. Possibly, isolation and culture of the nephrogenic zone in its original composition will help in a first issue to solve some of the mentioned problems [130].|$|R
2500|$|Beta-catenin also {{acts as a}} <b>morphogen</b> {{in later}} stages of {{embryonic}} development. Together with TGF-β, an important role of β-catenin is to induce a morphogenic change in epithelial cells. It induces them to abandon their tight adhesion and assume a more mobile and loosely associated mesenchymal phenotype. During this process, epithelial cells lose expression of proteins like E-cadherin, Zonula occludens 1 (ZO1), and cytokeratin. At {{the same time they}} turn on the expression of vimentin, alpha smooth muscle actin (ACTA2), and fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1). They also produce extracellular matrix components, such as type I collagen and fibronectin. Aberrant activation of the Wnt pathway has been implicated in pathological processes such as fibrosis and cancer. [...] In cardiac muscle development, beta-catenin performs a biphasic role. Initially, the activation of Wnt/beta-catenin is essential for committing mesenchymal cells to a cardiac lineage; however, in later stages of development, the downregulation of beta-catenin is required.|$|E
2500|$|The famous text [...] "The {{chemical}} {{basis of}} morphogenesis," [...] written in 1952 by mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing advocated for various biological models based on molecular diffusion of nutrients. However, a diffusive model of vascular development {{would seem to}} fall short {{of the complexity of}} capillary beds and the interwoven network of arteries and veins. In 2000, Fleury proposed that instead of diffusive molecules bearing responsibility for the branching morphogenesis of the vascular tree, a long-range <b>morphogen</b> may be implicated. In this model, a traveling pressure wave would act upon the vasculature via shear stress to rearrange branches into the lowest-energy configuration by widening vessels carrying increased blood flow and rearranging networks upon the initiation of fluid flow. It is known that mechanical forces can have a dramatic impact on the morphology and complexity of the vascular tree. However, 난these forces have comparably little impact on the diffusion of nutrients, and it therefore seems unlikely that acquisition of nutrients and oxygen plays a significant role in embryonic vascular remodelling.|$|E
50|$|The French flag {{model is}} a {{conceptual}} definition of a <b>morphogen,</b> described by Lewis Wolpert in the 1960s.

50|$|During early development, <b>morphogen</b> {{gradients}} {{result in}} the differentiation of specific cell types in a distinct spatial order. The <b>morphogen</b> provides spatial information by forming a concentration gradient that subdivides a field of cells by inducing or maintaining the expression of different target genes at distinct concentration thresholds. Thus, cells far from {{the source of the}} <b>morphogen</b> will receive low levels of <b>morphogen</b> and express only low-threshold target genes. In contrast, cells close to the source of <b>morphogen</b> will receive high levels of <b>morphogen</b> and will express both low- and high-threshold target genes. Distinct cell types emerge {{as a consequence of the}} different combination of target gene expression. In this way, the field of cells is subdivided into different types according to their position relative to the source of the <b>morphogen.</b> This model is assumed to be a general mechanism by which cell type diversity can be generated in embryonic development in animals.|$|E
50|$|Alan Turing, {{and later}} the {{mathematical}} biologist James Murray, described a mechanism that spontaneously creates spotted or striped patterns: a reaction-diffusion system.

50|$|The {{concept of}} the <b>morphogen</b> {{has a long history}} in {{developmental}} biology, dating back to the work of the pioneering Drosophila (fruit fly) geneticist, Thomas Hunt Morgan, in the early 20th century. Lewis Wolpert refined the <b>morphogen</b> concept in the 1960s with the French flag model, which described how a <b>morphogen</b> could subdivide a tissue into domains of different target gene expression (corresponding to the colours of the French flag). This model was championed by the leading Drosophila biologist, Peter Lawrence. Christiane Nusslein-Volhard was the first to identify a <b>morphogen,</b> Bicoid, one of the transcription factors present in a gradient in the Drosophila syncitial embryo. She was awarded the 1995 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine for her work explaining the morphogenic embryology of the common fruit fly. Groups led by Gary Struhl and Stephen Cohen then demonstrated that a secreted signalling protein, Decapentaplegic (the Drosophila homologue of transforming growth factor beta), acted as a <b>morphogen</b> during the later stages of Drosophila development.|$|E

40|$|In biology, embryological {{development}} {{of the structure of}} an organism or limb is referred to as morphogenesis. As a result of morphogenesis, complex shapes and patterns can form starting from just a single cell. Two main mechanisms that contribute to the embryo’s development are cell movement and cell specialization based on cell position. These mechanisms are influenced by special chemical substances created and released in a cell called <b>morphogens.</b> <b>Morphogens</b> freely diffuse from one cell to another through cell membrane and their local concen-tration at each cell affect the {{development of}} that cell. The first mathematical model of morphogenesis was proposed by Alan Turing in his 1952 paper “The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis”. In his model, there are two <b>morphogens</b> a and b. They tend to diffuse from higher concentration to lower concentration [Figure 1]. For example, if a particular cell has a higher concentration of chemical b than its neighbors, then that cell’s concentration of b will decrease over time by diffusion to its neighbors. Likewise, if the concentration of b is at minimum at a particular place along the row of cells, then more of b will diffuse from adjacent cells to this cell to raise the concentration of b at that cell. Diffusion is not the only mechanism changing the concentration of morphogens; the <b>morphogens</b> can also react with each other. The outcome of the reaction depends on the amount of <b>morphogens</b> a and b already in the cell. In its general form, the changes in concentration of these <b>morphogens</b> over time can be described by the following non-linear partial differential equations...|$|R

This basic statement involves several cellular processes, such as neuronal differentiation, the polarized outgrowth of axons and dendrites from differentiated neurons, and the pathfinding of axons towards target cells. The subsequent recognition of complementary synaptic partners finally triggers the formation, maturation, and maintenance of functional synapses. <b>Morphogens</b> are secreted signaling molecules commanding tissue patterning and cell identity during early embryonic development. Remarkably, growing evidence {{over the last years}} arising from different invertebrate and vertebrate model organisms has shown that, after cell fate has been established, <b>morphogens</b> also control the precise wiring and function in the developing and mature nervous system. Accordingly, dysfunctions of the signaling pathways activated by these molecules contribute to synaptic disassembly and altered function in diseases affecting the nervous system. We consider it timely to bring together cumulative evidence pointing to crucial roles for signaling activated by different <b>morphogens</b> in the establishment of precise contacts between neurons and their synaptic partners. Therefore, this research topic issue combines review and research articles aimed to cover the functional relevance of such <b>morphogens</b> on the different steps involved in synaptic assembly and function. Diverse model systems of physiological or pathological conditions have been included, as well as different cellular, biochemical and molecular approaches.
