40|$|This note {{explores the}} {{question}} of a mortgagee 2 ̆ 7 s insurable interest under a standard <b>mortgage</b> <b>clause</b> as the process of foreclosure ripens his status from that of mortgagee to property owner. The author argues that while fire insurance recovery rights of the foreclosing mortgagee may appear to be a viable solution to apportionment of indemnity, when the rules are applied to deny recovery, the system becomes unjust. This creates an incentive for the mortgagee to avoid the foreclosure sale (when there is a fire loss to the property), so as to force the loss on the insurance carrier...|$|E
40|$|Faced with {{an issue}} of first {{impression}} in Nebraska and a confusing body of law from other states, the Nebraska Supreme Court recently stopped just short of giving carte blanche approval to the enforceability of a due-on-sale clause in a real estate mortgage. With Occidental Savings and Loan Association v. Venco Partnership, Nebraska joined a growing majority of states which enforces <b>mortgage</b> <b>clauses</b> that accelerate the maturity of a note upon {{the transfer of the}} mortgaged property. Although the due-on-sale clause is of relatively recent origin, it already has become a major economic tool enabling savings and loan associations to balance their loan portfolios. Its use as an economic weapon cannot be overstated, as market analysts insist that use of the due-on-sale could mean the difference between continued loan availability and the eventual loss of long-term mortgages altogether. Analysis of the due-on-sale clause sheds light on its place in the real estate world and highlights the age-old conflict between property and contract rights. This note addresses the Nebraska due-on-sale opinion, studies its possible ramifications, and draws comparisons to the law in other jurisdictions. It {{is important to note that}} a simple listing of jurisdictions, classifying their stance on due-on-sale enforceability is an oversimplification at best. The issues are complex and thus require careful examination...|$|R
50|$|The vast {{majority}} (but not all) of mortgages today have acceleration clauses. The holder of a <b>mortgage</b> without this <b>clause</b> {{has only two}} options: either to wait until all of the payments come due or convince a court to compel a sale of {{some parts of the}} property in lieu of the past due payments. Alternatively, the court may order the property sold subject to the mortgage, with the proceeds from the sale going to the payments owed the mortgage holder.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of a trailer home, whether it is a fixture or chattel has a bearing on whether a real {{property}} mortgage applies to the trailer. For example, most <b>mortgages</b> contain a <b>clause</b> that forbids the borrower from removing or demolishing fixtures on the property, which would lower the value of the security. However, there have been cases where lenders lend money based on the value of the trailer home on the property, where that trailer is later removed from the property. Similarly, a chattel mortgage granted to allow a person to purchase a trailer home could be lost if the trailer is later attached to real property.|$|R
50|$|In <b>mortgages,</b> an {{attornment}} <b>clause</b> is {{a clause}} whereby the mortgagor attorns tenant to the mortgagee, thus giving the mortgagee {{the right to}} distrain, as an additional security. As used in modern legal transactions, the term attornment refers to an acknowledgment {{of the existence of}} the relationship of landlord and tenant. A tenant often has the duty under the tenant's lease, particularly in commercial leases, to provide an attornment upon request, and is required by a creditor or potential buyer of property from the landlord to establish the nature of existing encumbrances on and income streams flowing from a property, as an element of the due diligence process associated with the transaction. Frequently, a tenant must declare the existence of any outstanding disputes with the landlord at the time the attornment is executed and waives any dispute not declared at that time.|$|R
40|$|Today, {{virtually}} all <b>mortgages</b> contain acceleration <b>clauses</b> permitting the mortgagee {{to accelerate the}} mortgage indebtedness upon default by the mortgagor as defined in the mortgage loan documentation. Section 8. 1 of the new Restatement (Third) of Property: Mortgages [hereinafter Mortgages Restatement] 1 endorses the view that these mortgage acceleration provisions are generally enforceable after default {{in accordance with their}} terms. Following default and acceleration, the mortgagor may prevent foreclosure only by redeeming the property from the mortgage debt, i. e., “only by paying or tendering to the mortgagee the full accelerated mortgage obligation. ” Section 8. 1 (d) (3), however, places certain constraints upon the mortgagee 2 ̆ 7 s right to accelerate, permitting the mortgagor to reinstate (after curing any existing defaults) if “the mortgagee has engaged in fraud, bad faith, or other conduct making acceleration unconscionable. ” This standard has a significant judicial pedigree in mortgage law decisions, but its use of the elusive term “bad faith” [...] a term often understood in the context of its more honorable twin, “good faith” [...] creates the potential for uncertainty in the evaluation of disputes over the enforcement of acceleration provisions...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{we study}} {{tradeoffs}} associated with homeownership and renting. We consider {{a model in}} which housing capital generates housing services, but also requires regular maintenance. A household wants to purchase a flow of housing services. Maintenance on the house providing this flow to the household can be performed by the household itself or by an outside property manager. We abstract from taxes or other government distortions. The household contracts with a bank/landlord that has funds sufficient to make a lumpy housing investment. We do not assume that the bank/landlord can observe the household's effort, consumption, or savings. We show that simple renting of the house from the bank/landlord is an optimal contract {{for the provision of}} housing services to the household, conditional on the outside property manager being hired. If the manager is not hired, it is optimal for the bank/landlord to lend the money to the household to acquire housing services by purchasing a home. In this arrangement, the bank's interest is secured by a zero-down, fixed-rate <b>mortgage</b> with a <b>clause</b> prohibiting subordinated financing. We use a parameterized example to compare the values that an average household can obtain in the renting contract against the owning contract. In this example, renting clearly wins. Mortgages; Housing; Taxation...|$|R
40|$|This article {{illustrates}} the imbalance {{of power between}} the mortgagor and mortgagee, which is particularly apparent for individual mortgagors. Prepayment and due on sale provisions are standard mortgage terms that contribute to this imbalance. Although these clauses purport to operate separately, in reality, both are frequently triggered by {{the sale of a}} property; the law of contract suggests that these provisions should not be enforceable. Relevant legislation is lacking in this area and should be reformed to provide more effective consumer protection while acknowledging that banks operate with the goal of maximizing business. A reasonable compromise would involve basing the transferability of mortgages on objective criteria such as the size of the down payment provided by the buyer, rather than leaving it purely to the discretion of the lender.
