40|$|General {{atmospheric}} circulation {{is the system}} of atmospheric motions over the Earth {{on the scale of}} the whole globe. Two main types of circulation have been identified: zonal - characterized by low amplitude waves in the troposphere moving quickly from west to east, and meridional with stationary high amplitude waves when the <b>meridional</b> <b>transfer</b> is intensified. The prevailing type of circulation is related to global climate. Based on many years of observations, certain circulation epochs have been defined when the same type of circulation prevails for years or decades. Here we study the relation between long-term changes in solar activity and prevailing type of {{atmospheric circulation}}, using NAO index reconstructed for the last four centuries as a proxy for large-scale atmospheric circulation. We find that when the southern solar hemisphere is more active, increasing solar activity in the secular solar cycle results in increasing zonality of the circulation, while when the northern solar hemisphere is more active, increasing solar activity increases meridional circulation. In an attempt to explain the observations, we compare the short-term reaction of NAO and NAM indices to different solar drivers: powerful solar flares, high speed solar wind streams, and magnetic cloud...|$|E
40|$|Sediment {{proxy data}} from the Norwegian, Greenland, and Iceland seas (Nordic seas) are {{presented}} to evaluate surface water temperature (SST) differences between Holocene and Eemian times and to deduce from these data the particular mode of surface water circulation. Records from planktic foraminiferal assemblages, CaCO 3 content, oxygen isotopes of foraminifera, and iceberg-rafted debris form the main basis of interpretation. All results indicate for the Eemian comparatively cooler northern Nordic seas than for the Holocene due {{to a reduction in}} the northwardly flow of Atlantic surface water towards Fram Strait and the Arctic Ocean. Therefore, the cold polar water flow from the Arctic Ocean was less influencial in the southwestern Nordic seas during this time. As can be further deduced from the Eemian data, slightly higher Eemian SSTs are interpreted for the western Iceland Sea compared to the Norwegian Sea (ca. south of 70 °N). This Eemian situation is in contrast to the Holocene when the main mass of warmest Atlantic surface water flows along the Norwegian continental margin northwards and into the Arctic Ocean. Thus, a moderate northwardly decrease in SST is observed in the eastern Nordic seas for this time, causing a <b>meridional</b> <b>transfer</b> in ocean heat. Due to this distribution in SSTs the Holocene is dominated by a meridional circulation pattern. The interpretation of the Eemian data imply a dominantly zonal surface water circulation with a steep meridional gradient in SSTs...|$|E
40|$|Geostrophic eddies have {{traditionally}} been viewed within oceanography as diffusing water masses and tracers in a down-gradient manner. However, eddies also have an advective role {{that may lead to}} an up-gradient transfer of tracers, as has been recognized in atmospheric tracer studies and recent eddy parameterizations developed for the ocean. Eddies provide an advective transfer or "bolus" velocity through the secondary circulation formed by the slumping of density surfaces in baroclinic instability. Here we use an eddy-resolving isopycnal ocean model to investigate the <b>meridional</b> <b>transfer</b> across a zonal jet. The jet undergoes baroclinic instability, forming a vibrant eddy field and inducing a meridional bolus velocity. The bolus velocity is found to be correlated with gradients of potential vorticity rather than thickness. A transient tracer is released with high and low values at the southern and northern boundaries respectively. Over the first few years, the tracer spreads diffusively in a down-gradient manner. The implied eddy diffusivity of the passive tracer is found to be reassuringly {{similar to that of the}} dynamic tracer, potential vorticity. On the decadal time scale, however, the eddy-induced advection dominates and leads to a poleward spreading of tracer in the upper layer, and equatorward spreading of tracer in the lower layer. This eddy-induced advection is likely to be important in controlling the water-mass distribution wherever the time-mean meridional flow is weak. Observationally, the transport velocity is difficult to measure directly, but we argue might be inferred from the spreading of transient tracers, such as CFCs, before they reach a statistically-steady state...|$|E

The implications of the two types of parameterization for the <b>meridional</b> <b>transfers</b> of momentum and mnsible heat and the partitioning of the zonal variances of momentum and temperature in terms of their availability for pole-ward transport (which inVOlV 0 S the proper depiction of the eddies) are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Two-dimensional, radiative-convective-dynamical {{models of}} the visible atmospheres of Jupiter and Uranus are presented. Zonally-averaged {{temperatures}} and heat fluxes are calculated numerically as functions of pressure and latitude. In addition to radiative heat fluxes, the dynamical heat flux due to large-scale baroclinic eddies is included and is parametrized using a mixing length theory which gives heat fluxes {{similar to those of}} Stone. The results for Jupiter indicate that the internal heat flow is non-uniform in latitude and nearly balances the net radiative flux leaving the atmosphere. The thermal emission is found to be uniform in latitude in agreement with Pioneer and Voyager observations. Baroclinic eddies are calculated to transport only a small amount of the meridional heat flow necessary to account for the uniformity of thermal emission with latitude. The bulk of the <b>meridional</b> heat <b>transfer</b> is found to occur very deep in the stable interior of Jupiter as originally proposed by Ingersoll and Porco. The relative importance of baroclinic eddies vs. internal heat flow in the thermal balance of Uranus depends on the ratio of emitted thermal power to absorbed solar power. The thermal balance of Uranus is compared to that of Jupiter for different values of this ratio...|$|R
40|$|Constraining deep-ocean {{circulation}} during past greenhouse climatic periods, {{such as the}} Cretaceous, {{is important}} for understanding <b>meridional</b> heat <b>transfer</b> processes, controls on ocean anoxia, and the relative roles of climate and tectonics in determining paleocirculation patterns. Ocean circulation models for the Late Cretaceous and early Paleogene suggest that significant deep-water production occurred in the Southern Ocean, but cannot constrain when this process commenced or what the temporal relationship was between opening tectonic gateways and Late Cretaceous climatic cooling. Nd-isotope data obtained from biogenic apatite (fish teeth and bones) are presented from lower bathyal and abyssal sites in the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans. During the mid-Cretaceous, relatively radiogenic Nd-isotope values suggest that deep-water circulation in these basins was sluggish with inputs likely dominated by seawater-particle exchange processes and, possibly, easily weathered volcanic terranes. In the Campanian-Maastrichtian the Nd-isotopic composition of proto-Indian and South Atlantic deep waters became less radiogenic, suggesting the onset of deep-water formation in the Southern Ocean (Southern Component Water, SCW), consistent with Paleogene reconstructions and ocean circulation models. A combination of Southern Hemisphere cooling {{and the opening of}} tectonic gateways during the Campanian likely drove the onset of SCW. © 2010 Geological Society of America...|$|R
40|$|Sediment cores {{from the}} Norwegian Sea were studied to {{evaluate}} interglacial climate {{conditions of the}} marine isotope stage 5 e (MIS 5 e). Using planktic forminiferal assemblages as the core method, a detailed picture {{of the evolution of}} surface water conditions was derived. According to our age model, a step-like deglaciation of the Saalian ice sheets is noted between ca. 135 and 124. 5 Kya, but the deglaciation shows little response with regard to surface ocean warming. From then on, the rapidly increasing abundance of subpolar forminifers, concomitant with decreasing iceberg indicators, provides evidence for the development of interglacial conditions sensu stricto (5 e-ss), a period that lasted for about 9 Ky. As interpreted from the foraminiferal records, and supported by the other proxies, this interval of 5 e-ss was in two parts: showing an early warm phase, but with a fresher, i. e., lower salinity, water mass, and a subsequent cooling phase that lasted until ca. 118. 5 Kya. After this time, the climatic optimum with the most intense advection of Atlantic surface water masses occurred until ca. 116 Kya. A rapid transition with two notable climatic perturbations is observed subsequently during the glacial inception. Overall, the peak warmth of the last interglacial period occurred relatively late after deglaciation, and at no time did it reach the high warmth level of the early Holocene. This finding must be considered when using the last interglacial situation as an analogue model for enhanced <b>meridional</b> <b>transfer</b> of ocean heat to the Arctic, with the prospect of a future warmer climate.

40|$|International audienceMoisture {{exchange}} between the South Atlantic and southern Africa is {{examined in this}} study through zonal moisture transport. Along the west coast of southern Africa, a multivariate analysis of the zonal flow of moisture computed from NCEP-DOE AMIP II Re-analyses reveals a primary mode of variability typical of variations in intensity and of the latitudinal migration of the circulation associated with the midlatitude westerlies and the South Atlantic anticyclone. In austral summer (January–February), this mode, referred to as the South Atlantic midlatitude mode, is found to be well correlated with rainfall over southern Africa (i. e. to the south of the upper lands surrounding the Congo basin). Its positive/negative phases are found to correspond with surface pressures changes over the South Atlantic region in austral summer when the South Atlantic anticyclone is shifted northward/southward respectively. Such changes are accompanied by dipole-like SST anomalies in the midlatitude South Atlantic Ocean, while simultaneous SST anomalies with a similar structure are also found over South Indian Ocean regions. In January–February, positive/negative events linked to the South Atlantic midlatitude mode are marked by meridional shifts (northward/southward) and weakening/strengthening of the ITCZ over the southern tropics, together with modulations in intensity (weakened/sustained) of the Angola low, which could act as a tropical source of moisture for Tropical Temperate Troughs (TTTs). In association with a strengthened/weakened zonal component of the southern extension of the African Easterly Jet (AEJ), this could modulate the <b>meridional</b> <b>transfer</b> of moisture south of 15 °S to the advantage/detriment of Angolan coastal regions, where above/below rainfall are expected. Variations in the latitudinal position (northward/southward) of the South Atlantic anticyclone, and thus of the midlatitude westerlies, are also found to reduce/favour moisture advection towards southern Africa subtropics allowing the southern Indian trades to penetrate less/more over the subcontinent south of 25 °S. This would create a situation where convection processes are inhibited/supported within the SICZ/TTTs region resulting in drier/wetter conditions locally for positive/negative events respectively...|$|E
40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{attention}} has been paid to the inter-ocean exchange of thermohalineproperties in the Agulhas Retroflection region. Recent observations have shown thatthe highly energetic field of the southern half of the Cape Basin consists of bothcyclonic and anticyclonic eddies. These eddies interact with each other, resulting inthe vigorous stirring of these water mass. Investigations have shown that the cycloniceddies tend to be smaller and outnumber the anticyclonic rings. Nonetheless, verylittle is known of their characteristics and the nature in which they are formed. Usingremote sensing data, confirmed with hydrographic data, this study determines thelocation, frequency and seasonality of cyclonic eddy formation; their size, trajectoriesand lifespan; physical components and associations with Agulhas Rings. Cyclonic eddies were seen to split, merge and link with other cyclonic eddies, withsplitting events creating child cyclonic eddies. The 105 parent and 157 child cycloniceddies identified during this study show that an average of II parent and 17 childcyclonic eddies were formed annually. 31. 58 % follow an overall west-southwestdirection, with 27. 37 % translocating west north-westward. Poleward translocationspeeds average at 0. 3 kIn/day, whereas translocation speeds obtained from alldirectional components averages at 2. 153 kIn/day for parent and 2. 975 km/day forchild cyclonic eddies. Parent cyclonic eddies lived for approximately 254 days,whereas child cyclonic eddies survived for a mean of 188 days. Of note was asignificant variation of lifespan between parent and child cyclonic eddies formed inboth the north and south of the study area. 77 % of northern and 93 % of southerncyclonic eddies were formed directly adjacent to positive sea level anomalies orAgulhas Rings, resulting in an total overall association of 82. 93 % parent and 89. 63 %child cyclonic eddies. Cyclonic eddy groups were seen to merge at a rate of 16. 38 parent and 14 child cyclonic eddies per year, whereas topography appeared to affectthe demise of 17. 00 % of the investigated cyclonic eddies. Therefore this study may form a basis for further investigations into the influenceCape Basin cyclonic eddies have on the <b>meridional</b> <b>transfer</b> of heat, salt, nutrients,oxygen and carbon concentrations in the South-East Atlantic Ocean.

40|$|The Debrecen Photoheliographic Data {{catalogue}} is {{a continuation}} of the Greenwich Photoheliographic Results providing daily positions of sunspots and sunspot groups. We analyse the data for sunspot groups focusing on <b>meridional</b> motions and <b>transfer</b> of angular momentum towards the solar equator. Velocities are calculated with a daily shift method including an automatic iterative process of removing the outliers. Apart from the standard differential rotation profile, we find meridional motion directed towards the zone of solar activity. The difference in measured meridional flow in comparison to Doppler measurements and some other tracer measurements is interpreted as a consequence of different flow patterns inside and outside of active regions. We also find a statistically significant dependence of meridional motion on rotation velocity residuals confirming the transfer of angular momentum towards the equator. Analysis of horizontal Reynolds stress reveals that the transfer of angular momentum is stronger with increasing latitude up to about 40 ^∘ where there is a possible maximum in absolute value.

40|$|Climate {{records of}} the mid-to-late Holocene transition, between 3 – 4 {{thousand}} years before present (ka), often exhibit a rapid change {{in response to the}} gradual change in orbital insolation. Here we investigate North Atlantic Central Water circulation as a possible mechanism regulating the latitudinal temperature gradient (LTG), which, in turn, amplifies climate sensitivity to small changes in solar irradiance. Through this mechanism, sharp climate events and transitions are the result of a positive feedback process that propagates and amplifies climate events in the North Atlantic region. We explore these linkages using an intermediate water temperature record reconstructed from Mg/Ca measurements of benthic foraminifera (Hyalinea balthica) from a sediment core off NW Africa (889 m depth) between 0 to 5. 5 ka. Our results show that Eastern North Atlantic Central Waters (ENACW) cooled by ~ 1 °± 0. 7 [*]°C~ 1 °± 0. 7 [*]°C and densities decreased by σθ= 0. 4 ± 0. 2 σθ= 0. 4 ± 0. 2 between 3. 3 and 2. 6 ka. This shift in ENACW hydrography illustrates a transition towards enhanced mid-latitude atmospheric circulation after 2. 7 ka in particular during cold events of the late-Holocene. The presented records demonstrate the important role of ENACW circulation in propagating the climate signatures of the LTG by reducing the <b>meridional</b> heat <b>transfer</b> from high to low latitudes during the transition from the Holocene Thermal Maximum to the late-Holocene. In addition, the dynamic response of ENACW circulation to the gradual climate forcing of LTGs provides a prime example of an amplifying climate feedback mechanism...|$|R
40|$|We {{study how}} tides in a binary system induce some {{specific}} internal shear mixing, able to substantially modify {{the evolution of}} close binaries prior to mass transfer. We construct numerical models accounting for tidal interactions, meridional circulation, transport of angular momentum, shears and horizontal turbulence and consider a variety of orbital periods and initial rotation velocities. Depending on orbital periods and rotation velocities, tidal effects may spin down (spin down Case) or spin up (spin up Case) the axial rotation. In both cases, tides may induce a large internal differential rotation. The resulting tidally induced shear mixing (TISM) is so efficient that the internal distributions of angular velocity and chemical elements are greatly influenced. The evolutionary tracks are modified, and in both cases of spin down and spin up, large amounts of nitrogen can be transported to the stellar surfaces before any binary mass <b>transfer.</b> <b>Meridional</b> circulation, when properly treated as an advection, always tends to counteract the tidal interaction, tending to spin up the surface when it is braked down and vice versa. As a consequence, the times needed for the axial angular velocity to become equal to the orbital angular velocity may be larger than given by typical synchronization timescales. Also, due to meridional circulation some differential rotation remains in tidally locked binary systems. Comment: 10 pages, 18 figures, Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysic...|$|R
40|$|Water column silicon isotopic {{signatures}} (&delta; 30 Si) of {{silicic acid}} (Si(OH) 4 ) in the Southern Ocean were measured along a meridional transect from South Africa (Subtropical Zone) down to 57 ° S (northern Weddell Gyre). These data {{are the first}} reported for a summer transect across the whole Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). &delta; 30 Si variations are large in the upper 1000 m, reflecting {{the effect of the}} silica pump superimposed upon <b>meridional</b> <b>transfer</b> across the ACC: the transport of Antarctic surface waters northward by a net Ekman drift and their convergence and mixing with warmer upper-ocean Si-depleted waters to the north. Using Si isotopic signatures, we determined different mixing interfaces between ACC water masses: the Antarctic Surface Water (AASW), the Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW), and the thermoclines in the low latitude areas. The residual silicic acid concentrations of end-members control the &delta; 30 Si alteration of the mixing products. With the exception of AASW, all mixing interfaces have a highly Si-depleted mixed layer end-member. These processes deplete the silicic acid AASW concentration across the different interfaces northward without significantly changing the AASW &delta; 30 Si. By comparing our new results with a previous study in the Australian sector we show that during the circumpolar transport of the ACC eastward, there is a slight but significant Si-isotopic lightening of the silicic acid pools from the Atlantic to the Australian sectors. This results either from the dissolution of biogenic silica in the deeper layers and/or from an isopycnal mixing with the deep water masses in the different oceanic basins: North Atlantic Deep Water in the Atlantic, and Indian Ocean deep water in the Indo-Australian sector. This eastward lightening is further transmitted to the subsurface waters, representing mixing interfaces between the surface and deeper layers. Using the Si-isotopic constraint, we estimate for the Greenwich Meridian a net biogenic silica production which should be representative of the annual export, at 4. 5 ± 1. 1 and 1. 5 ± 0. 4 mol Si m− 2 for the Antarctic Zone and Polar Front Zone, respectively, in agreement with previous estimations.

40|$|This study investigates {{three types}} of {{atmospheric}} forcing across the summertime subtropics that are shown to contribute in various ways to the occurrence of dry and wet climates in the subtropics. To explain the formation of desert over the western parts of continents and monsoon over the eastern parts, we propose a new mechanism of positive feedback between diabatic heating and vorticity generation that occurs via meridional advection of planetary vorticity and temperature. Monsoon and desert are demonstrated to coexist as twin features of multi-scale forcing, as follows. First, continent-scale heating over land and cooling over ocean induce the ascent of air over the eastern parts of continents and western parts of oceans, and descent over eastern parts of oceans and western parts of continents. Second, local-scale sea-breeze forcing along coastal regions enhances air descent over eastern parts of oceans and ascent over eastern parts of continents. This leads {{to the formation of}} the well-defined summertime subtropical LOSECOD quadruplet-heating pattern across each continent and adjacent oceans, with long-wave radiative cooling (LO) over eastern parts of oceans, sensible heating (SE) over western parts of continents, condensation heating (CO) over eastern parts of continents, and double dominant heating (D: LO+CO) over western parts of oceans. Such a quadruplet heating pattern corresponds to a dry climate over the western parts of continents and a wet climate over eastern parts. Third, regional-scale orographic-uplift-heating generates poleward ascending flow to the east of orography and equatorward descending flow to the west. The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is located over the eastern Eurasian continent. The TP-forced circulation pattern is in phase with that produced by continental-scale forcing, and the strongest monsoon and largest deserts are formed over the Afro-Eurasian Continent. In contrast, the Rockies and the Andes are located over the western parts of their respective continents, and orography-induced ascent is separated from ascent due to continental-scale forcing. Accordingly, the deserts and monsoon climate over these continents are not as strongly developed as those over the Eurasian Continent. A new mechanism of positive feedback between diabatic heating and vorticity generation, which occurs via <b>meridional</b> <b>transfer</b> of heat and planetary vorticity, is proposed as a means of explaining the formation of subtropical desert and monsoon. Strong low-level longwave radiative cooling over eastern parts of oceans and strong surface sensible heating on western parts of continents generate negative vorticity that is balanced by positive planetary vorticity advection from high latitudes. The equatorward flow generated over eastern parts of oceans produces cold sea-surface temperature and stable stratification, leading in turn to the formation of low stratus clouds and the maintenance of strong in situ longwave radiative cooling. The equatorward flow over western parts of continents carries cold, dry air, thereby enhancing local sensible heating as well as moisture release from the underlying soil. These factors result in a dry desert climate. Over the eastern parts of continents, condensation heating generates positive vorticity in the lower troposphere, which is balanced by negative planetary vorticity advection of the meridional flow from low latitudes. The flow brings warm and moist air, thereby enhancing local convective instability and condensation heating associated with rainfall. These factors produce a wet monsoonal climate. Overall, our results demonstrate that subtropical desert and monsoon coexist as a consequence of multi-scale forcing along the subtropics...|$|E

These processes deplete the silicic acid AASW concentration northward, across the different interfaces, without significantly changing the AASW δ 30 Si composition. By comparing our new results with a previous study in the Australian sector we show that during the circumpolar transport of the ACC eastward, the δ 30 Si composition of the silicic acid pools is getting slightly, but significantly lighter from the Atlantic to the Australian sectors. This results either from the dissolution of biogenic silica in the deeper layers and/or from an isopycnal mixing with the deep water masses in the different oceanic basins: North Atlantic Deep Water in the Atlantic, and Indian Ocean deep water in the Indo-Australian sector. This isotopic trend is further transmitted to the subsurface waters, representing mixing interfaces between the surface and deeper layers. Through the use of δ 30 Si constraints, net biogenic silica production (representative of annual export), at the Greenwich Meridian is estimated to be 5. 2 ± 1. 3 and 1. 1 ± 0. 3 mol Si m − 2 for the Antarctic Zone and Polar Front Zone, respectively.

40|$|Storm tracks play a {{major role}} in {{regulating}} the precipitation and hydrological cycle in midlatitudes. The changes in the location and amplitude of the storm tracks in response to global warming will have significant impacts on the poleward transport of heat, momentum and moisture and on the hydrological cycle. Recent studies have indicated a poleward shift of the storm tracks and the midlatitude precipitation zone in the warming world that will lead to subtropical drying and higher latitude moistening. This study agrees with this key feature for not only the annual mean but also different seasons and for the zonal mean as well as horizontal structures based on the analysis of Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) CM 2. 1 model simulations. Further analyses show that the meridional sensible and latent heat fluxes associated with the storm tracks shift poleward and intensify in both boreal summer and winter in the late twenty-first century (years 2081 - 2100) relative to the latter half of the twentieth century (years 1961 - 2000). The maximum dry Eady growth rate is examined to determine the effect of global warming on the time mean state and associated available potential energy for transient growth. The trend in maximum Eady growth rate is generally consistent with the poleward shift and intensification of the storm tracks in the middle latitudes of both hemispheres in both seasons. However, in the lower troposphere in northern winter, increased <b>meridional</b> eddy <b>transfer</b> within the storm tracks is more associated with increased eddy velocity, stronger correlation between eddy velocity and eddy moist static energy, and longer eddy length scale. The changing characteristics of baroclinic instability are, therefore, needed to explain the storm track response as climate warms. Diagnosis of the latitude-by-latitude energy budget for the current and future climate demonstrates how the coupling between radiative and surface heat fluxes and eddy heat and moisture transport influences the midlatitude storm track response to global warming. Through radiative forcing by increased atmospheric carbon dioxide and water vapor, more energy is gained within the tropics and subtropics, while in the middle and high latitudes energy is reduced through increased outgoing terrestrial radiation in the Northern Hemisphere and increased ocean heat uptake in the Southern Hemisphere. This enhanced energy imbalance in the future climate requires larger atmospheric energy transports in the midlatitudes which are partially accomplished by intensified storm tracks. Finally a sequence of cause and effect for the storm track response in the warming world is proposed that combines energy budget constraints with baroclinic instability theory...|$|R
