500|$|A {{number of}} {{undergraduate}} academic programs at Florida State University are termed [...] "Limited Access Programs". Limited Access Programs are programs where student demand exceeds available resources. Admission is thus restricted and sometimes extremely competitive. Examples of limited access programs include The Florida State University Film School, <b>the</b> College <b>of</b> Communication and Information, <b>the</b> College <b>of</b> Nursing, Computer Science, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>majors</b> in <b>the</b> College <b>of</b> Education, several <b>majors</b> in <b>the</b> College <b>of</b> Visual Arts, Theatre and Dance and all <b>majors</b> in <b>the</b> College <b>of</b> Business.|$|R

Riley often lamented the lack of change in the program, but found when he tried to introduce new material, or left out any of his most popular poems, the crowds would demand encores until he agreed to recite their favorites.|$|E
5|$|It is {{very rare}} for snow to fall in the U.S. state of Florida, {{especially}} in the central and southern portions of the state.

In the Florida Keys and Key West there is no known occurrence of snow flurries since the settlement of the region.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the Brunswick Oels Jägers gave a good {{account of}} {{themselves}} during the war. The regiment — really a single battalion—arrived in Portugal in early 1811. The Duke of Wellington distributed one company to the 4th Division and two companies to the 5th Division as skirmishers, while the remaining nine companies {{served in the}} newly formed 7th Division. The Oels remained in this organization {{until the end of}} the war in April 1814.

2500|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> musicians' {{strike that}} lasted for <b>the</b> {{duration}} <b>of</b> 1948, James recorded no new material for commercial release by his record label Columbia during this period, and outside of this period when he did record for Columbia, the label tended {{to focus more on}} James's pop releases. <b>The</b> combination <b>of</b> these two factors makes these tracks some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> few available that represent James's jazz style during this period. This is unfortunate because as music critic Marc Myers has stated, [...] " [...] band <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mid-1940s was more modern than <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>majors,</b> and in 1949 he led one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finest bands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year." ...|$|R

5|$|Settlers moved {{further south}} {{into what is}} now the Namadgi National Park. William Herbert made a claim over part of the Orroral Valley at some point between 1826 and 1836, while during the 1830s Garrett Cotter {{inhabited}} what would later be named the Cotter River Valley, in his honour. From the late 1830s, the Boboyan Homestead and station were established. Gudgenby was settled in the early 1840s and the Gudgenby Homestead was erected around this time. By 1848 <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> valleys of the Namadgi area had been settled.|$|E

5|$|The {{ships of}} the Deutschland class {{continued}} {{to serve in}} the II Battle Squadron during World War I.

5|$|A {{study in}} 2009 of seven {{mitochondrial}} genes (mtDNA) and three nuclear genes grouped fork-marked lemurs with sportive lemurs (family Lepilemuridae), offering {{a host of}} explanations, such as a possible hybridization (introgression) following the initial split between the families. A study published in 2013 also grouped fork-marked lemurs with sportive lemurs when it used 43morphological traits and mtDNA. If correct, this would make the family Cheirogaleidae paraphyletic. Broad agreement between two lemur phylogeny studies—one in 2004 using SINE analysis and another in 2012 using multilocus phylogenetic tests—gave strong support for a sister group relationship between fork-marked lemurs {{and the rest of}} the cheirogaleids and a more distant relationship with sportive lemurs. The split between Phaner {{and the rest of the}} cheirogaleids is thought to have occurred approximately 38mya (million years ago), not long after the radiation of <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> lemur groups on Madagascar, roughly 43mya.|$|E

5|$|Although {{investigation}} of Preclassic remains is difficult at Motul de San José {{due to the}} overlying Late Classic construction, {{it is evident that}} the site experienced major growth during the Late Preclassic (300 BCAD 300) and became a sizeable centre. At roughly the same time, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> structures were built at Akte, and Chakokot experienced its earliest occupation during the Late Preclassic. In contrast, Buena Vista appears to have been lightly occupied. La Trinidad de Nosotros also underwent major expansion in the Late Preclassic and became larger and more important than Motul de San José, with its architectural layout being finalised in this period – later Classic period construction was superimposed upon pre-existing Late Preclassic structures.|$|E
5|$|Crustaceans have a {{rich and}} {{extensive}} fossil record, which begins with animals such as Canadaspis and Perspicaris from the Middle Cambrian age Burgess Shale. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> groups of crustaceans appear in the fossil record {{before the end of}} the Cambrian, namely the Branchiopoda, Maxillopoda (including barnacles and tongue worms) and Malacostraca; there is some debate as to whether or not Cambrian animals assigned to Ostracoda are truly ostracods, which would otherwise start in the Ordovician. The only classes to appear later are the Cephalocarida, which have no fossil record, and the Remipedia, which were first described from the fossil Tesnusocaris goldichi, but do not appear until the Carboniferous. Most of the early crustaceans are rare, but fossil crustaceans become abundant from the Carboniferous period onwards.|$|E
5|$|Galerina marginata is a {{saprobic}} fungus, obtaining nutrients {{by breaking}} down organic matter. It {{is known to}} have <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> classes of secreted enzymes that dissolve plant cell wall polysaccharides, and {{has been used as a}} model saprobe in recent studies of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Because of its variety of enzymes capable of breaking down wood and other lignocellulosic materials, the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI) is currently sequencing its genome. The fungus is typically reported to grow on or near the wood of conifers, although it has been observed to grow on hardwoods as well. Fruit bodies may grow solitarily, but more typically in groups or small clusters, and appear in the summer to autumn. Sometimes, they may grow on buried wood and thus appear to be growing on soil.|$|E
