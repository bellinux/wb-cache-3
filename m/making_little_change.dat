50|$|In aeronautics, {{air brakes}} or speedbrakes are {{a type of}} flight control {{surfaces}} used on an aircraft to increase drag or increase the angle of approach during landing.Air brakes differ from spoilers in that air brakes are designed to increase drag while <b>making</b> <b>little</b> <b>change</b> to lift, whereas spoilers reduce the lift-to-drag ratio and require a higher angle of attack to maintain lift, resulting in a higher stall speed.|$|E
40|$|When {{multiple}} microphones {{are used}} to reproduce multiple sources microphone interference, or bleed, can occur due to each micro-phone picking up more than one source. This paper proposes com-bining the crosstalk resistant adaptive noise canceller (CTRANC) algorithm with centred adaptive filters using an estimation of delay to suppress the interference, while <b>making</b> <b>little</b> <b>change</b> to the tar-get signal. The proposed method is compared with similar meth-ods in both the anechoic and echoic cases. The method is shown to outperform the other methods in the anechoic case while in the echoic case it is shown to perform less well at reducing {{the level of the}} interference but still introduces the least artefacts. Extension to the proposed method to the N source and microphone case is also discussed. 1...|$|E
30|$|The oil/water {{interfacial}} {{properties of}} crude oil emulsions formed by alkaline/surfactant/polymer (ASP) flooding in the Daqing Oilfield were investigated in this paper by the measurement of interfacial tension, interfacial shear viscosity and Zeta potential of the oil/water system. The result showed that both NaOH and Na 2 CO 3 could react with acid substances in the crude oil to produce interfacially active components, which are adsorbed on the interfaces between the aqueous phase and oil phase, resulting in a decrease of the interfacial tension, negatively charging the surface of oil droplets, but <b>making</b> <b>little</b> <b>change</b> in the interfacial shear viscosity. For the same ionic strength of NaOH and Na 2 CO 3, the interfacial tension of NaOH solution-crude oil system is lower, but the interfacial shear viscosity of NaOH solution-crude oil system is higher, than that of Na 2 CO 3 solution-crude oil system. The negative value of the Zeta potential {{on the surface of}} the oil droplets is large. Accordingly, the O/W emulsion of NaOH solution-crude oil system is more stable than that of Na 2 CO 3 solution-crude oil system.|$|E
40|$|When {{colloidal}} suspensions dry, stresses {{build up}} and cracks often occur - a phenomenon undesirable for important {{industries such as}} paint and ceramics. We demonstrate an effective method which can completely eliminate cracking during drying: by adding emulsion droplets into colloidal suspensions, we can systematically decrease the amount of cracking, and eliminate it completely above a critical droplet concentration. Since the emulsion droplets eventually also evaporate, our technique achieves an effective function while <b>making</b> <b>little</b> <b>changes</b> to the component of final product, and may therefore serve as a promising approach for cracking elimination. Furthermore, adding droplets also varies the speed of air invasion and provides a powerful method to adjust drying rate. With the effective control over cracking and drying rate, our study may find important applications in many drying and cracking related industrial processes. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

50|$|In 2008, {{there was}} only a small amount of switchgrass {{dedicated}} for ethanol production. In order for it to be grown on a large-scale production it must compete with existing uses of agricultural land, mainly for the production of crop commodities. Of the United States' 2.26 billion acres (9.1 million km2) of unsubmerged land, 33% are forestland, 26% pastureland and grassland, and 20% crop land. A study done by the U.S. Departments of Energy and Agriculture in 2005 determined whether there were enough available land resources to sustain production of over 1 billion dry tons of biomass annually to replace 30% or more of the nation’s current use of liquid transportation fuels. The study found that there could be 1.3 billion dry tons of biomass available for ethanol use, by <b>making</b> <b>little</b> <b>changes</b> in agricultural and forestry practices and meeting the demands for forestry products, food, and fiber. A recent study done by the University of Tennessee reported that as many as 100 million acres (400,000 km2, or 154,000 sq mi) of cropland and pasture will need to be allocated to switchgrass production in order to offset petroleum use by 25 percent.|$|R

50|$|By 1917 and {{the time}} of World War I, the olive drab service uniform had {{gradually}} become used more frequently and the blue uniform was worn only on formal dress occasions. As a result, metal insignia was authorized for wear on the service uniform on the shoulder loop and on the collar of the shirt when worn without a jacket. Shortly after the United States entered the war, only the service olive drab uniform was being worn. The need for an insignia for the second lieutenant became urgent. Among the proposals was one to authorize for that grade a single bar, the first lieutenant two bars, and the captain three bars. However, the policy of <b>making</b> as <b>little</b> <b>change</b> as possible prevailed, and a gold bar was adopted in 1917, following the precedent previously established by the adoption of the major’s insignia.|$|R

30|$|Phishing is a cyber {{security}} threat which is {{performed with the}} help of social engineering techniques to trick Internet users into revealing personal and secret information [1]. Detection and prevention of phishing attacks is a big challenge as the attacker performs these attacks {{in such a way that}} it can bypass the existing anti-phishing techniques [2, 3]. Moreover, sometimes an educated and experience user may also fall under this attack [4]. In this attack, the attacker makes a fake webpage by copying or <b>making</b> a <b>little</b> <b>change</b> in the legitimate page, so that an internet user will not able to differentiate between phishing and legitimate webpages. One of the effective solutions to prevent a phishing attack is to integrate security features with the web browser which can raise the alerts whenever a phishing site is accessed by an internet user. Generally, web browsers provide security against phishing attacks {{with the help of}} list-based solutions. The list-based solutions contain either black-list or white-list. These list-based solutions match the given domain with the domains present in the black-list or white-list to take the appropriate decision [5, 6]. The combination of technical experts and security software verify when a new domain needs to be added in this list. Security software checks the various features of a webpage to verify identity [7].|$|R
40|$|Assessment of knowledge, attitudes, and {{practices}} (KAP) {{is a crucial}} element of hypertension control, but little information is available from developing countries where hypertension has lately been recognized as a major health problem. Therefore, we examined KAP on hypertension in {{a random sample of}} 1067 adults aged 25 to 64 years from the Seychelles Islands (Indian Ocean). KAP were assessed from an administered structured questionnaire. The age-standardized prevalence of hypertension (screening blood pressure [BP] > or = 160 / 95 mm Hg or taking antihypertensive medication) was 36 % in men and 25 % in women aged 25 to 64 years. Among hypertensive persons, 50 % were aware of the condition, 34 % were treated, and 10 % had controlled BP (ie, BP < 160 / 95 mm Hg). Most persons, whether nonhypertensive, unaware hypertensive, or aware hypertensive, had good basic knowledge related to hypertension determinants and consequences, possibly an effect of a nationwide cardiovascular disease prevention program over the last years. However, favorable outcome expectation, positive attitudes, and appropriate practices for hypertension and relevant healthy lifestyles were found in smaller proportions of participants, with little difference between aware hypertensives, unaware hypertensives, and nonhypertensives. Furthermore, hypertensive persons with other concurrent cardiovascular risk factors affecting the overall heart risk knew well the detrimental effects of these other factors but reported <b>making</b> <b>little</b> actual <b>change</b> to control them (particularly regarding overweight and sedentary habits). These data point to the need to maximize the efficiency of hypertension prevention and control programs so that delay in achieving effective hypertension control is minimized in countries experiencing recent emergence of hypertension as a major public health problem...|$|R
