5|$|As a child, Marmaduke was academically {{gifted and}} also a keen boxer and long-distance swimmer. He also took a keen {{interest}} in mechanical things, particularly combustion engines, and was building <b>Meccano</b> models of aircraft and other vehicles by the age of 12. In his early teens, he became an avid amateur mechanic, fixing the family motor car and learning to drive. Marmaduke was never a hard worker and did not embark upon an academic career, but was considered to possess above average intelligence. In 1929, he passed the Junior Certificate Exam with first class honours. The certificate qualified him for Victoria Boy's High School from which he graduated in 1931.|$|E
25|$|Five of the Dublo models {{enjoyed a}} new lease on life when <b>Meccano</b> was {{purchased}} by Lines Brothers.|$|E
25|$|Some other {{examples}} include Bayko, Konstruk-Tubes, K'Nex, Erector Sets, Tinkertoys, and <b>Meccano,</b> and generic construction toys such as Neodymium magnet toys.|$|E
50|$|The {{train set}} was only {{produced}} in 1967, {{and is now}} extremely rare. It is notable as the last O Gauge train to be made at <b>Meccano's</b> famous Binns Road factory in Liverpool, where the Hornby tinplate trains were made.|$|R
50|$|Although it {{was still}} {{being used as a}} hotel until the 1970s, it also served as a pub for the most part of the twentieth century. In 1970 John Murdoch and Robert Stowe {{acquired}} the property, they then transferred the title to a syndicate of West Australians (including Len Buckeridge), trading as Melbourne Hotel Pty Ltd. Buckeridge's company, L. W. Buckeridge and Associates, drew up the plans for the first major work undertaken on the hotel. These works involved extensive additions to {{the west side of the}} hotel and internal renovations. In the 1970s, the ground and first floors were used as a nightclub and cabaret lounge. Later, in the 1980s and 1990s, they were known as Tiffany's Nightclub, The Firm Nightclub, The Pink Galah Cabaret, Middleways Piano Bar, and <b>Meccanos.</b>|$|R
50|$|Corgi Toys (trademark) is {{the name}} of a range of {{die-cast}} toy vehicles produced by Mettoy Playcraft Ltd. in the United Kingdom. The Mettoy (Metal Toy) company was founded in 1933 by German émigré Philip Ullmann in Northampton, England, where he was later joined by South African-born German Arthur Katz, who had previously worked for Ulmann at his toy company Tipp and Co of Nuremberg. They decided to market a range of toy vehicles as competition to <b>Meccano's</b> Dinky Toys model vehicles, which had dominated the British market for many years. Corgi Toys were introduced in the UK in July 1956 and were manufactured in Swansea, Wales, for twenty seven years before the company went into liquidation. A management buy-out re-formed the company as Corgi Toys Limited in March 1984. In 1989, the management sold the Corgi brand to Mattel and the factory was retained under the name of Microlink Industries Ltd. In 1995, Corgi regained its independence as a new company, Corgi Classics Limited, and moved to new premises in Leicester.|$|R
25|$|In 1951, French <b>Meccano</b> {{has been}} the first post-war European {{manufacturer}} to introduce 1:43 scale. Initially, the scales of French Dinky Toys {{were similar to those}} of English Dinkys. The Citroën Traction Avant (24N), released in 1949, was 1:48, while the Ford Vedette 1949 (24Q), released in 1950, was 1:45, the same scales as used in the British 40 series. But then, in 1946 <b>Meccano</b> France released their first car in 1:43 scale: the Jeep (24M) (Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia).|$|E
25|$|<b>Meccano</b> Ltd {{exported}} Dinky Toys {{to all of}} the United Kingdom's old colonies relatively cheaply {{because of}} existing Commonwealth trade agreements. South Africa was one of its big importers.|$|E
25|$|Liverpool {{inventor}} Frank Hornby was {{a visionary}} in toy development and manufacture; he produced {{three of the}} most popular lines of toys in the 20th century: <b>Meccano,</b> Hornby Model Railways and Dinky Toys.|$|E
25|$|Frank Hornby {{established}} <b>Meccano</b> Ltd. in 1908 to make {{metal construction}} sets. The company later moved into model railroading {{with their first}} O gauge clockwork trains appearing in 1920 (Ellis 2009, p.15; Wainwright 2013).|$|E
25|$|When South Africa {{withdrew from}} the Commonwealth in 1961, it imposed a luxury goods import tax, making Dinky Toys very {{expensive}} – a potential loss for <b>Meccano</b> Ltd. To resolve this problem, <b>Meccano</b> Ltd began shipping Dinky Toy parts to South Africa in 1962 where models were assembled and painted locally. The import of unfinished goods was {{not subject to the}} tax. These models were sold in South Africa between 1962 and 1963 and it is believed that only one batch of each model was produced, making South African Dinky Toys very rare. South Africa also imported Dinky Toys parts from the French factory in 1966 and six models were assembled and painted locally (Binns Road website).|$|E
25|$|As {{import duties}} were high on {{finished}} goods and reduced on components, {{to get into}} the Spanish market, <b>Meccano</b> s.a. (France) exported sixteen unpainted and unassembled Dinky Toys to The Novades Poch Company in Barcelona. There the models were finished and fitted with specific Pirelli tyres.|$|E
25|$|The parent company, Humbrol, {{had gone}} into {{administration}} earlier that year after cashflow problems. Airfix fans had been concerned {{that it could be}} the end of the brand, but just as the name Hornby was once a tradename of <b>Meccano,</b> Airfix is now a successful tradename of Hornby.|$|E
25|$|In 1912 Frank Hornby set up {{an office}} in Paris on Rue Ambroise Thomas to import <b>Meccano</b> toys into France. By 1921, the French market had proved so {{successful}} that production of <b>Meccano</b> began in Paris at the newly opened factory on Rue Rebeval, with another plant opening in 1931 in Bobigny where production of the Dinky Toys range would be based. In the early days production consisted mainly of tiny model trains cast in lead, with vehicles gradually increasing in number. By the late 1930s the French Dinky Toys range had begun to diversify {{from that of the}} British parent company, concentrating on the products of the French motor manufacturers and eventually including; Citroën, Peugeot, Simca, Renault, Panhard and Ford of France (Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, pp.62–63).|$|E
25|$|Parsonage Colliery at Leigh had the UK's deepest mine—1,260 metres in 1949. Macclesfield was {{the base}} of UK's silk weaving industry. John Benjamin Dancer of Manchester invented microphotography in 1839, which would lead to {{microform}} in the 1920s. Frank Hornby from Liverpool invented <b>Meccano</b> in 1901, where <b>Meccano</b> Ltd would be based for over 60 years. Bryant and May's site in Garston was the last wooden match factory in the UK, closing in 1994 to become The Matchworks business centre off the A561 west of the former Speke airport. Cottonopolis was the industrial name for Manchester and the local area. Manchester at one time was the world's richest city. The CIS Tower, built by John Laing in 1962, was Europe's tallest building, and Britain's tallest building until 1963, and Manchester's tallest building until 2006.|$|E
25|$|During the Second World War the <b>Meccano</b> factory was commandeered by {{the invading}} Germans {{and used in}} the Nazi war effort. The Bobigny factory was also {{produced}} an equivalent toy to the <b>Meccano</b> using the Märklin name. From 1945, the model vehicles were forcibly shod with solid metal wheels and the pumps did not have rubber hoses due to the shortage of rubber which was needed for the army. In the early post war period, rubber was needed badly as the French supply came from Cambodia and Laos in war against France, rubber tyres were not fitted on models until 1950. In 1951, the headquarters and offices which were still at Rue Rebeval closed and Dinky Toys production was now solely based at Bobigny. (The Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia and Dinky Toys les modèles d'avant guerre, 1934–1940).|$|E
25|$|According to a {{contract}} between <b>Meccano</b> s.a. and Pilen, the last five so called French Dinkys were in fact Pilen models designed and tooled in Algeciras and fitted with a Dinky Toys base plate. Like the previous series, they were sold in France as Dinky and are very rare and as Pilen in Spain. (The Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia).|$|E
25|$|Around 1952 -54, <b>Meccano</b> Ltd {{shipped to}} South Africa a limited edition set of {{vehicles}} for the South African Defence Force. This set included a Motor Truck, a Covered Wagon, an Ambulance, a Dispatch Rider, a Van, a petrol tanker, a fire engine, a road roller, a Mechanical horse and trailer, a loudspeaker van. (The Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia).|$|E
25|$|In 1974 labour {{was getting}} too {{expensive}} in France, and <b>Meccano</b> subcontracted the manufacture of some models to Auto Pilen s.a. in Spain. These models had already been made in France and were sold exclusively under the marque Dinky. When the Calais factory closed {{down some of the}} recent tools were sent to Liverpool where the models were produced with new baseplates. Some of these tools were later sent to Auto-Pilen where they were modified or updated before; being re-issued, however it is not known if the dies were modified by <b>Meccano</b> or by Pilen. These models were sold in France under the marque Dinky, they were clearly identified as Dinky and as MADE IN SPAIN on the base plate. In Spain they were sold as Pilen and marked as such. Pilen models, most of which were Dinky dies, were very popular and numerous in Spain and commonly sold in El Corte Engles and Galerias Preciados department stores.|$|E
25|$|The Tri-ang {{group was}} disbanded in 1971 when <b>Meccano</b> Ltd's owner Lines Bros. filed for bankruptcy. The former Tri-ang Hornby {{was sold to}} Dunbee-Combex-Marx, {{becoming}} Hornby Railways in 1972. By 1976 Hornby was facing challenges from Palitoy and Airfix, {{both of which were}} producing high quality detailed models. Detail on the models was upgraded to make the product line more attractive to adult hobbyists.|$|E
25|$|Dinky Toys was {{the brand}} name for {{die-cast}} Mazak zinc alloy miniature vehicles produced by <b>Meccano</b> Ltd. They were made in England from 1934 to 1979, at a factory in Binns Road in Liverpool. Dinky Toys {{were among the most}} popular diecast vehicles ever made - predating other popular diecast marques, including Corgi, Matchbox, and Mattel's Hot Wheels (Ralston 2009, 7; Richardson 1999, 128).|$|E
25|$|Hornby was {{at first}} a tradename for the railway {{productions}} of <b>Meccano</b> Ltd and based in Liverpool, which released its first train, a clockwork 0 gauge (1:48) model, in 1920. An electric train soon followed but was under-designed and the few that were made were sold out in France. In 1925, a much more successful electric model was introduced, operating on the high voltage of 110 volts AC power.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, Lines Bros Ltd., {{the parent}} company of rival Tri-ang Railways, {{purchased}} <b>Meccano</b> Ltd., and merged Hornby and Tri-ang into Tri-ang Hornby. The former Hornby line was discontinued in favour of Tri-ang's less costly plastic designs. The Hornby Dublo tooling was sold to G & R Wrenn, which continued to make most of the loco range and 'superdetail' rolling stock. Remaining stocks of 0 gauge were either scrapped or sold to the local retailer Hattons.|$|E
25|$|In November 1958, <b>Meccano</b> Ltd {{introduced}} the Dublo Dinky range of models in 1:76 OO scale, {{designed to be}} used with the Hornby railway system (Force 1988, pp.165–166). These were relatively cheap to produce – having a one-piece die-cast metal body, a base plate and or windows on some, and plastic wheels. There was the added bonus of being able to compete in the small-scale toy car market which, at the time was dominated by Lesney's Matchbox (see Force 1988, p.47).|$|E
25|$|Production {{of model}} {{aircraft}} resumed {{after the war}} with a mixture re-issues of pre-war and new models of civilian airliners and new jet-powered aircraft. Production of Dinky planes tailed off in 1968 but was resurgent in 1971 {{with a range of}} World War II types complete with battery-powered propellers, modern jet fighters, and even a Sea King helicopter. These large scale planes had been developed by Airfix but were made by <b>Meccano</b> Ltd. which had just been bought by Airfix.|$|E
25|$|During 1978 and 1979, {{production}} of Dinky Toys in Hong Kong was again resumed. These were poor quality models, however, compared to earlier Dinkys, and {{an attempt to}} cut production costs and possibly shift production should the Binns Road Factory close, which it eventually did. So, the last new Dinky Toys made by <b>Meccano</b> were Hong Kong products. These are now {{some of the most}} sought after of all Dinky Toys. A few, such as the Mk2 Ford Granada, and Steed's Jaguar from the New Avengers TV series exist as pre-production examples only.|$|E
25|$|The range {{met with}} limited {{success and the}} first model was {{withdrawn}} in October 1960 having only been on sale for 18 months – there was no replacement. Within 22 months of their launch there were price reductions to 3 models. Further models were withdrawn in May 1961, September 1962 and March 1963 until in November 1963 those models that remained were taken off the shelf six years after the Dinky Dublo line was introduced. Thus ended the production of Dublo Dinky Toys under <b>Meccano</b> who went into receivership two years later.|$|E
25|$|These were {{colourful}} and attractive, but low-market {{and only}} clockwork. They {{probably would have}} failed in the marketplace because several established U.S. firms could undercut them and Hornby offered no better-class goods or electric models, but the Wall Street Crash precipitated matters. In late 1929, <b>Meccano</b> Ltd. sold its New Jersey factory to the A. C. Gilbert Company and Hornby trains had vanished from the U.S. market by 1930. The leftover inventory was sold in Canada and in the UK {{and some of the}} tooling was reused for products in other markets.|$|E
25|$|Some smaller {{vehicles}} were also produced alongside model track workers, passengers, station staff and other O scale track side accessories (<b>Meccano</b> Dinky 1934 p.332). All {{of these early}} cars were inaccurate representations and had die-cast metal bodies, chassis and wheels with rubber tyres. By August 1935 there were around 200 different products in the Dinky Toys range which included die-cast ships, aeroplanes and small trains. Dinky Toys model cars were available individually in trade packs of 6 cars per pack. Most models would not be available in individual boxes until 1952.|$|E
25|$|<b>Meccano</b> {{continued}} producing detailed Dinky Supertoys {{commercial vehicles}} through the fifties and sixties, including such subjects as a Mobile Television Control Room and Camera Van in both BBC and ABC Television liveries, a Leyland test chassis with removable miniature 5 ton weights, {{a series of}} military vehicles including a Corporal Erecting Vehicle and missile (a subject also modelled by Corgi Toys at the same time), a range of Thornycroft Mighty Antar heavy haulage transporters complete with loads and a Horse Box in British Railways and later in Newmarket liveries.|$|E
25|$|<b>Meccano</b> {{introduced}} its OO scale trains in 1938 {{under the name}} 'Hornby Dublo'. The locomotives were diecast metal, and the carriages and wagons were generally made of tinplate. This was a very well planned range of electric and clockwork models, successfully consolidating 12V DC as the standard for OO scale. This led {{to the adoption of}} OO as a broadly accepted modelling standard in the UK, whereas {{much of the rest of}} the world adopted HO scale. As for their O gauge locomotives, electric Hornby Dublo locomotives ran on a third rail electric system with the track built on a pressed tinplate base.|$|E
25|$|<b>Meccano</b> {{was a model}} {{construction}} system that consisted of re-usable metal strips, plates, angle girders, wheels, axles and gears, with nuts and bolts to connect the pieces and enabled the building of working models and mechanical devices. Dinky Toys pioneered the manufacture of die-cast toys with the production of toy cars, trains and ships and model train sets became popular in the 1920s. The Britain's company revolutionized the production of toy soldiers with {{the invention of the}} process of hollow casting in lead in 1893 – the company's products remained the industry standard for many years.|$|E
25|$|The {{golden age}} of toy {{development}} was {{at the turn of}} the 20th century. Real wages were rising steadily in the Western world, allowing even working-class families to afford toys for their children, and industrial techniques of precision engineering and mass production was able to provide the supply to meet this rising demand. Intellectual emphasis was also increasingly being placed on the importance of a wholesome and happy childhood for the future development of children. William Harbutt, an English painter, invented plasticine in 1897, and in 1900 commercial production of the material as a children's toy began. Frank Hornby was a visionary in toy development and manufacture and was responsible for the invention and production of three of the most popular lines of toys based on engineering principles in the twentieth century: <b>Meccano,</b> Hornby Model Railways and Dinky Toys.|$|E
25|$|Models were well-proportioned {{and looked}} similar in style to {{contemporary}} Matchbox or Budgie Toys. For example, similar to Matchbox, the Land Rover (which {{came with a}} horse trailer) had windows, grey or black plastic wheels and a black base (see photo, Force 1988, p.47).The model in the photograph is a very poor example and any self respecting collector wouldn't have it on the shelf. Wheels, however, (the Land Rover had one on the bonnet {{as well as one}} underneath) were somewhat flatter and wider than those of Matchbox and their circumference was not ribbed at the beginning but this feature was added later. The baseplate, however, was pressed steel with etched lettering (not diecast with moulded lettering {{as was the case with}} Matchbox, Budgie Toys or Lone Star vehicles). Finally, the Land Rover had a trailer hook behind which was a cut, curved extension of the baseplate. The front and rear axles were held to the vehicle differently. The front was covered by the tube of the baseplate and held pinched on each side by extensions of the diecast body. The rear axle was exposed and run through holes in rounded sections folded over on each side of the plate. The ref. 072 Bedford articulated lorry was a reproduction of the <b>Meccano</b> factory lorry, its articulated flat trailer was dimensioned to receive the Hornby Dublo container. (The Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia).|$|E
500|$|Local volunteers {{under the}} {{guidance}} of the Manchester Bolton and Bury Canal Society have for years worked on sections of the canal, removing overgrowth and tidying up its general appearance. [...] A new pedestrian footbridge, designed by artist Liam Curtin, was opened at Nob End Locks in April 2013. [...] Made entirely out of scaled-up pieces of <b>Meccano,</b> it was built by society volunteers {{and other members of the}} public at a cost of about £90,000. [...] Toward the end of 2015, work began to restore water to the top lock at Nob End.
