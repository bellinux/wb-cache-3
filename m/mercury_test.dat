It was also {{the only one of}} the original four Atlas pads to never have a booster explode on it. By 1959, it was decided to convert the pad for the Atlas D missile and space launches, and a large service tower was added early in the year. The first Atlas flown from the renovated LC-14 was Missile 7D on May 18, however a problem with the launcher hold-down arms damaged the missile and caused its explosion shortly after launch. This was traced to improper procedures during the renovation of the pad and was quickly fixed. The first space launch off of LC-14 was the Big Joe <b>Mercury</b> <b>test</b> in September. As the designated Mercury-Atlas facility, LC-14 was thus the only Atlas pad sporting the infrastructure needed for manned launches.

Absorption of the proton beam produces rapid heating of the mercury, {{resulting in the}} formation of acoustic shock waves and the nucleation of cavitation bubbles. The subsequent collapse of these cavitation bubbles promote erosion of the steel target walls. Preliminary measurements using two passive cavitation detectors (megahertz-frequency focused and unfocused piezoelectric transducers) installed in a <b>mercury</b> <b>test</b> target to monitor cavitation generated by proton beams with charges ranging from 0. 041 to 4. 1 muC will be reported on.

This emission was consistent with an inertial cavitation collapse of a bubble with an estimated maximum bubble radius of 0. 19 mm, based on collapse time. The peak pressure in the mercury for the initiation of cavitation was predicted to be 0. 6 MPa. For a beam charge of 0. 41 muC and higher, the lifetimes of the bubbles exceeded the reverberation time of the chamber (approximately 300 mus), and distinct windows of cavitation activity were detected, a phenomenon that likely resulted from the interaction of the reverberation in the chamber and the cavitation bubbles...|$|E

40|$|In {{the scope}} of this work the {{hydrogenation}} of diacids was investigated in depth on the example of itaconic acid. Rutheniumcatalysts with phoshineligands were stable and active hydrogenation catalysts. Mono- and bydentate ligands catalyse the conversion towards the 2 - and 3 -methyl-gamma-butyrolactone (2 -MBGL and 3 -MGBL) whereas the tridentate ligand 1, 1, 1 -Tris-(diphenylphosphinomethyl) ethane (TriPhos) 2 -methyl- 1, 4 -butandiol (MBDO) yielded. Best solvents were found to be cyclic ethers which were inert under reaction conditions and in which the catalyst-components as well as the substrate were soluble. The reaction temperature had a high influence on the selectivity and activity of the reaction. Beneath 150 °C no reaction was observed. Between 150 °C und 185 °C mainly the lactones 2 -MBGL and 3 -MGBL were formed and above this temperature the conversion of the lactones to the diol MBDO took place. To reach a high yield in 3 -Methyltetrahydrofuran (3 -MTHF) acidic additives had to be added. The combination of para-tolenesulfonic acid and ammoniumhexafluorophosphat in dioxan as solvent yielded 95 % 3 -MTHF. The reaction profile was recorded and it could be verified that the lactone hydrogenation proceeds only when the free acid is fully converted. The catalyst recycling is possible as recycling experiments showed. The use of 3 -MTHF as solvent for the reaction resulted in complete conversion of itaconic acid. As reaction products the lactones 2 -MBGL and 3 -MGBL with 53 % and 3 -MTHF were identified. The possibility to influence the regio- and enantioselectivity was investigated for the synthesis of the lactones were. Variation of the ligand showed that rac-BINAP has a high conversion as well as a high chemoselectivity with a regioselectivity toward 3 -MGBL. The enantioselective hydrogenation with the complex (BINAP) chlorodihydridoruthenium(II) yielded a regiomeric ratio of 1. 9 and an ee-(R) of the same regioisomere of 5 %. The scope of the catalyst system could be broadened to other biogenic diacids such as succinic acid, fumaric acid and methyl succinic acid with only little changes to the reaction conditions. The system could be optimized with fumaric acid as substrate to yield gamma-butyrolacton with 97 %, 1, 4 -butandiol with 83 % and THF with 95 % depending on the conditions. The reactivity of 2 -MGBL and MBDO was unexpected under reaction conditions the backreaction of MBDO the lactones was observed. To explain this behavior the active species was further investigated. An indication for a molecular catalyst was the negative <b>mercury</b> <b>test</b> for the presence of nanoparticles. The complex carbonyldihydrido(TriPhos) ruthenium(II) could be identified as single organometallic complex after the reaction. The formation of carbonyldihydrido(TriPhos) ruthenium(II) by decarbonylation of aldehydes could be demonstrated. A new synthesis route was developed yielding carbonyldihydrido(TriPhos) ruthenium(II) in 85 % as yellow powder from rutheniumacetylacetonat, Triphos and propanal. By comparision of the activity of carbonyldihydrido(TriPhos) ruthenium(II) to the in situ system in the hydrogenation of levulinic acid the role of carbonyldihydrido(TriPhos) ruthenium(II) as catalyst could be clarified. Examples for the catalytic active species could be identified with levulinic acid and an acidic ionic liquid...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutical Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005 β-m-Hydroxyphenylhydracrylic acid (BHHA) is an {{aromatic}} {{organic acid}} frequently {{detected in the}} urine of patients. The diagnostic value of this acid is as yet unknown. Previous reports indicated that BHHA may be of bacterial origin. With the aim to establish the diagnostic value of BHHA organic acid GC-MS analyses were conducted on {{more than a thousand}} patients. The creatinine value for each urine sample was determined and the volumes of acid and derivatization reagent adjusted accordingly to facilitate the analysis of constant amounts of creatinine. The concentration of BHHA was determined using an internal standard, 3 -phenylbutyrig acid. The urine of nineteen patients that showed elevated BHHA were further analysed to determine the presence of other abnormal metabolites. Phenylalanine (Phe) loading was also done on one of these samples and Phe and tyrosine (Tyr) were measured. The effect of aspartame on the concentration of Phe in this patient was also tested. A <b>mercury</b> <b>test</b> was also done on one of the patients, to determine the role that mercury plays in the transport of amino acids. The concentrations of BHHA ranged from trace amounts to more than a 1000 mmol/mol creatinine. Other metabolites with elevated levels in the urine of the nineteen patients included: phydroxyphenylacetic acid, m-hydroxyhippuric acid, p-hydroxyhippuric acid and p-hydroxyphenyllactic acid. These patients also excreted a few unique metabolites: benzoylsuccinic acid, phenylacrylylglycine, phenylacetylglycine and β -m-hydroxyphenylhydracrylglycine. Two of the patients also displayed elevated levels of phenylacetic acid and phenyllactate in their urine. One patient had undergone a pancreasectomy for reasons unknown to us. Clinical symptoms in most cases were not acute. ADHD and hyperactivity were the most common symptoms present in the clinical profile of these patients. Because phenylacetic acid and phenyllactic acid (that were, besides BHHA, present in two of the patients) may be indicative of a phenylalanine metabolic defect, a phenylalanine loading was carried out on two of the patients. The Phe loading caused a decreased absorption of Phe. Subsequently this was followed up with a tryptophan loading. Tyrosine absorption, analogous with the phenylalanine, was reduced but tryptophan absorption was normal, excluding Hartnup's Disease (HD). Aspartame loading did however; effect higher Phe levels, indicating that peptide absorption was normal. The metabolites found in the urine of the patients suggest that they may be of a bacterial origin. Compounds such as benzoylsuccinic acid are produced only by anaerobic microorganisms. Most of the other metabolites excreted at abnormal concentrations can also be characterised as bacterial metabolites excreted in the urine as a result of maldigestion or malabsorption. One patient in this study had undergone a pancreasectomy in which case malabsorption would be expected. This investigation should be seen as a pilot study and quite extensive research is still required before a final conclusion will be reached. Currently it seems that BHHA is excreted as a result of malabsorption or maldigestion, as was expected, but it does appear however, that BHHA may be an important indicator of defects that may cause these abnormalities.
