5000|$|LRAD {{was founded}} in Utah by inventor/entrepreneur Elwood [...] "Woody" [...] Norris as the American Technology Corporation in 1980 (entity # 734088-0142). From 1988 to early 1992 the company was inactive. Norris recapitalized the company as a Delaware Corporation in 1992. In 1996, the company {{launched}} its first directed sound technology and began engineering sound solutions for the commercial, government, and military markets. In response to the October 2000 attack on the USS Cole, the company's engineering team developed the Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD). With the introduction of LRAD systems in 2003, the company entered the acoustic hailing device (AHD) market, followed {{by the introduction of}} the omnidirectional ONE VOICE™ <b>Mass</b> <b>Notifications</b> system in 2012. Today, LRAD communication sound systems are being used around the world in diverse applications including fixed and mobile military deployments, maritime security, critical infrastructure and perimeter security, commercial security, border and port security, law enforcement and emergency responder communications, and wildlife preservation and control.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} the epidemiology {{of the first}} nationwide outbreak of measles infection in the UK since {{the implementation of a}} <b>mass</b> vaccination campaign. <b>Notifications</b> of infectious diseases, interview and postal questionnaire identified 293 clinical cases, 138 of which were confirmed by salivary IgM, measles virus isolation and PCR. Twelve were epidemiologically linked to confirmed cases. The outbreak began in London, after contact with measles infection probably imported from Italy. Measles genotyping determined by sequence analysis confirmed spread to other unimmunized anthroposophic communities in the north, south west and south coast of England. Only two cases had been vaccinated against measles infection, and 90 % of cases were aged under 15 years. Measles virus can selectively target non-immune groups in countries with high vaccine uptake and broader herd immunity. Without harmonization of vaccination policies and uniform high coverage across Europe, the importation and spread of measles virus amongst non-immune groups may prevent the elimination of measles...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Assessing {{the impact}} of a {{healthcare}} quality program of essential hypertension in three primary healthcare centers (PHC) in the region of Monastir, Tunisia. Methods: The first phase was represented by an audit of the quality of care covering both the process and results using a referential. This step was performed on a sample of 390 patients followed for at least one year for essential hypertension. The second phase was devoted to setting priorities for healthcare improving and analysis of the causes of problems using the root cause analysis. The third phase was intended at establishing a quality assurance framework, which summarizes the planned activities as well as the selectedmonitoring indicators. The fourth phase was the impact evaluation of the program six months after, and uses the Lot Quality Assurance Sampling method. Results: The body <b>mass</b> index (BMI) <b>notification</b> ranged between 3. 8 % and 33. 8 % in the three study centers. The ophthalmic fundus was differently performed by center (from 13 % at the PHC 1 to 37 % at PHC 3). Furthermore, the patients’ knowledge of the normal blood pressure values ranged from 30 % to 59. 2 %. The post-intervention assessment phase shows that the BMI notification had reached the standard of 80 % in the three centers. Similarly the practice of the ophthalmic fundus had exceeded the defined standard (60 %) in each center. The knowledge of the normal blood pressure values as well as the proportion of controlled patients were significantly improved (p< 0. 01). Conclusion: The establishment of a quality improvement initiative enables local teams to implement correctives measures...|$|R

50|$|Overall, {{the more}} {{affordable}} {{the cost of}} procuring, installing, and maintaining an emergency communication system is, the more prolific such systems may become; and the more prolific these systems are, {{the more likely it}} is that these systems will be available to aid in times of emergency in more locations. According to Federal Signal, beyond supporting emergency response, today’s <b>mass</b> <b>notification</b> systems have proven to be a valuable asset for everyday, non-emergency, intra- and inter-plant communications. This has become particularly evident in the deployment of interoperable, multi-device communications technology that not only enhances overall plant communications, but provides a host of useful software-based management and administrative tools. Additionally, many of the more traditional approaches to <b>mass</b> <b>notification,</b> i.e., public address and intercom systems, e-mail, and voice and text messaging, provide everyday functionality for plant communications and process control that represents attractive potential for return on investment.|$|E
