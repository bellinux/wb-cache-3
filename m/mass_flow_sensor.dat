40|$|We {{report on}} a novel {{capacitive}} detection principle for Coriolis <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sensors</b> which allows for three times increased sensitivity. Capacitive Coriolis <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sensors</b> are normally read out by two electrodes that measure the ratio between the actuation mode and the Coriolis mode, which is induced by the <b>mass</b> <b>flow.</b> This ratio results in a phase shift between the two electrodes. By adding two additional read out electrodes, the actuation mode signal is partially canceled, allowing for higher sensitivity to the Coriolis mode, and thus larger phase shifts for the same <b>mass</b> <b>flows.</b> An analytical model is derived and corresponds with the measurements. It is also proven that the range and sensitivity of the sensor can be tuned by changing {{the size of the}} additional readout electrodes. This readout method does not increase the readout time...|$|R

5000|$|Harvesting on slopes {{decreases}} {{the accuracy of}} the mass flow sensing system in most cases. Due to different variations in impact plate placement by different manufacturers, the change in response from pitch and roll angles may differ slightly. In cases which the impact plate is located similar to that seen in the [...] "Impact based <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sensor</b> and clean grain elevator" [...] image, if the machine is pitched forward the mass flow will increase as gravity will aid in applying additional force to the <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sensor.</b> When the harvester is pitched aft, the sensor response is reduced as gravity reduces the amount of force applied to the <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sensor.</b> Roll causes similar error but of a smaller magnitude to that of the pitch of the harvester.|$|E

The complex shape and high aspect ratio of the micro channels do not allow conventional FEM modelling.

50|$|The modern {{automobile}} {{air intake}} system has three main parts, an air filter, <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sensor,</b> and throttle body. Some modern intake systems can be highly complex, and often include specially-designed intake manifolds to optimally distribute air and air/fuel mixture to each cylinder. Many cars today now include a silencer to minimize the noise entering the cabin. Silencers impede air flow and create turbulence which reduce total power, so performance enthusiasts often remove them.|$|E
50|$|The {{calibration}} process entails harvesting consistent crop at {{a constant}} speed to produce a consistent grain mass flow rate to the <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sensor.</b> A calibration is started through the yield monitor installed on the harvester and the operator begins harvesting grain. Once the recommended amount of grain harvested per the manufacturer's recommendations has been harvested, the grain is offloaded into a grain holding device equipped with an accurate scale to measure the actual weight of the grain harvested. This grain weight is then entered back into the yield monitor and is used to adjust the calibration that relates the electrical signal of the load cell to grain mass flow.|$|E

It is used in many cases, dependent upon manufacturer, in the grain <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sensor</b> calibration and provides producers with additional information about spatial variability within a field. Grain moisture is sensed by measuring the capacitance of the grain by passing a known grain volume between two electrically conductive plates.

This enables the measurement over the pressure drop of the Coriolis <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sensor</b> and ΔP flow sensing. By combining this pressure drop with the output signal of the Coriolis <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sensor,</b> real-time viscosity characterization is also possible.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} novel {{feedback}} based actua-tion electronics {{that use the}} voltage from the induction track of a Coriolis <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sensor</b> as input signal for a phase-locked loop. The phase-locked loop consists of a phase detector that measures {{the difference between the}} actuation voltage and the induction voltage from the Coriolis <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sensor.</b> A voltage controlled oscil-lator is directly tuned by this phase mismatch and synthesizes an harmonic signal for actuation. Therefore, the frequency of the signal synthesized by the phase-locked loop will gradually be adjusted to the resonance frequency of the Coriolis <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sensor,</b> making it more robust to disturbances. Besides, waveform shape and amplitude can be easily altered. First experimental results show that the phase-locked loop controls the frequency as a function of density for different fluids.

40|$|Abstract Background To {{assess a}} {{pulmonary}} function {{change over time}} the <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sensor</b> and the pneumotachograph are widely used in commercially available instruments. However, the smallest detectable change for both devices has never been compared. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study is to determine the smallest detectable change in vital capacity (VC) and single-breath diffusion parameters measured by <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sensor</b> and or pneumotachograph. Method In 28 healthy pulmonary function technicians VC, transfer factor for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and alveolar volume (VA) was repeatedly (10 ×) measured. The smallest detectable change was calculated by 1. 96 x Standard Error of Measurement ×√ 2. Findings The mean (range) of the smallest detectable change measured by <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sensor</b> and pneumotachograph respectively, were for VC (in Liter) : 0. 53 (0. 46 - 0. 65); 0. 25 (0. 17 - 0. 36) (p = 0. 04), DLCO (in mmol*kPa - 1 *min - 1) : 1. 53 (1. 26 - 1. 7); 1. 18 (0. 84 - 1. 39) (p = 0. 07), VA (in Liter) : 0. 66. (0. 53 - 0. 82); 0. 43 (0. 34 - 0. 53) (p = 0. 04) and DLCO/VA (in mmol*kPa - 1 *min - 1 *L - 1) : 0. 22 (0. 19 - 0. 28); 0. 19 (0. 14 - 0. 22) (p = 0. 79). Conclusions Smallest detectable significant change in VC and VA as measured by pneumotachograph are smaller than by <b>mass</b> <b>flow</b> <b>sensor.</b> Therefore, the pneumotachograph is the preferred instrument to estimate lung volume change over time in individual patients. </p...|$|E
