The distinct high gable roof of the torogan, thin at the apex and gracefully flaring out to the eaves, sits on huge structures enclosed by slabs of timber and lifted more than two meters above the ground by a huge trunk of a tree that was set on a rock.

50|$|Lastly, two {{residential}} buildings from the mid-20th century {{are worthy of}} mention. Somewhat unusual for <b>multifamily</b> <b>dwellings</b> of the period and area, the duplex at 411-413 Polk Street is a one-story building constructed of brick laid in five-course American bond. Built in 1940, the duplex’s spartan four-bay façade contains a pair of single-leaf entry doors in the two central bays, and each outer bay contains a 1/1 double-hung sash window. The doors and windows are capped by flat jackarches of soldier bricks, and a band of soldier bricks encircles the building at the water table. The building is covered by a flat roof that is obscured from view by a parapet wall that features shallow corbelling near the top. The large brick building at 600 Monroe Street, originally known as the Tal-Fred Apartments (118-5318-0059), rises two stories above Monroe Street, although the Sixth Street elevation contains three stories over a basement. Built circa 1940, the building apparently contained six relatively large apartment units. Covered by a hipped roof with vented dormer, the building’s primary entrance features a single-leaf entry door flanked by sidelights and topped by a semi-elliptical fanlight. The doorway is sheltered by a wooden canopy suspended by chains. In 1949, architect Pendleton S. Clark designed interior and exterior modifications, which likely included a greenstone patio enclosed by a low brick wall with greenstone coping that is located between the building and Monroe Street.|$|R

These vermin thrive in <b>multifamily</b> <b>dwellings</b> where {{excessive}} moisture, extensive cracks and crevices, abundant food sources, overcrowded closets, and stacks of paper provide them nutrition and shelter. Pesticides are applied in large quantities in urban communities to control vermin (Landrigan et al. 1999).

In Manhattan, the total quantity of pesticides applied by com-mercial applicators in 1998 was 270, 633 pounds (Thier 2000). Household studies have confirmed this pattern and have shown repeatedly that chemical pesticide use is com-mon in urban communities (Adgate et al. 2000; Berkowitz et al. 2003; Whyatt et al. 2002).

40|$|The {{acoustical}} environment in multi-family dwellings {{is an issue}} with a steadily increasing importance, and finding a balance between good acoustical privacy and cheap and effective construction methods {{is one of the}} biggest challenges for building designers today. The international standard regulates the sound insulation down to 100 Hz, but with the introduction of lightweight building materials as well as advanced home stereo equipment, low frequency sounds has become an increasingly important problem. This has led to an extension of the swedish sound insulation regulations down to 50 Hz. This master thesis aims to investigate if 50 Hz is a sufficiently low limit, or if it is neccessary to extend the limit further down to 20 Hz. This is done in three steps. First, it is investigated whether some objects commonly occuring in <b>multifamily</b> <b>dwellings</b> are able to excite low frequency sounds. Thereafter, the airborne and impact sound insulation in a lightweight construction are measured down to 20 Hz, in order to investigate how the sound insulation at low frequencies differs from the insulation in higher frequencies. Finally, the human perception of low frequency sounds are investigated by performing a listening test where the perceived annoyance level for different sounds commonly occuring in dwellings are analyzed. The investigation shows that there are many commonly occuring sound sources that are able to excite low frequency sounds. Most notably are doors that are being closed, subwoofers, and step sounds. The airborne and impact sound insulation were either the same or worse for frequencies below 50 Hz as the insulation at 50 Hz. The listening test showed that the annoyance level increases with increased sound pressure level. No difference in annoyance could be found between the different sound sources, and neither when comparing full frequency sounds with the same sound with frequencies below 50 Hz removed. Based on the results found in this thesis, and primary those from the listening test, it is not neccessary to extend the sound insulation measurement limit below 50 Hz.
