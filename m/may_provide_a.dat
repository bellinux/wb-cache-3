Hospice volunteers also provide administrative assistance to hospices.|$|E
5|$|HIV-1 {{infection}} causes chronic ongoing {{inflammation and}} production of reactive oxygen species. Thus, the HIV genome may be vulnerable to oxidative damages, including breaks in the single-stranded RNA. For HIV, {{as well as for}} viruses generally, successful infection depends on overcoming host defensive strategies that often include production of genome-damaging reactive oxygen. Thus, Michod et al. suggested that recombination by viruses is an adaptation for repair of genome damages, and that recombinational variation is a byproduct that <b>may</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> separate benefit.|$|E
5|$|Investigations of the {{mathematical}} structure of M-theory have spawned important theoretical results in physics and mathematics. More speculatively, M-theory <b>may</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> framework {{for developing a}} unified theory {{of all of the}} fundamental forces of nature. Attempts to connect M-theory to experiment typically focus on compactifying its extra dimensions to construct candidate models of our four-dimensional world, although so far none has been verified to give rise to physics as observed at, for instance, the Large Hadron Collider.|$|E

5|$|Natural predators {{of black}} bean aphids include both adults and larvae of ladybirds and lacewings and the larvae of hoverflies. Certain species of tiny {{parasitic}} wasps {{lay their eggs}} inside aphids and the developing wasp larvae devour their hosts from inside. Members of the wasp genera Diaeretiella and Lysiphlebus behave in this way and <b>may</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> measure of control of the aphids.|$|E
5|$|Organizations {{may also}} be {{directed}} specifically at influencing persons at some stage of life. Thus, we have midwives and doctors who are legally obliged to deliver the baby; as the child grows, the school, parents, and mass media come to the fore; as they reach working age, various economic organisations pull for the agent's attention; {{the church and the}} institution of marriage impact the actor in obvious ways; and finally, the State <b>may</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> pension to the elderly (Russell 1938:166–168).|$|E
5|$|Some site opponents assert that, {{after the}} {{predicted}} containment {{failure of the}} waste containers, these cracks <b>may</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> route for movement of radioactive waste that dissolves in the water flowing downward from the desert surface. Officials state that the waste containers will be stored {{in such a way}} as to minimize or even nearly eliminate this possibility.|$|E

5|$|The legendary traditions {{may also}} be in {{connection}} with the establishment of a trans-Carpathian frontier mark by the Hungarian monarchy, with its capital at Câmpulung, probably in {{the last decade of the}} 13th century. A tomb stone belonging to one of the leaders of this formation, Count Lawrence of Câmpulung (comes Laurentius de Longo Campo), dating from the year 1300, <b>may</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> solid chronological reference point. On the other hand, comes Laurentius may have been a one-time leader of the Saxon community in Câmpulung.|$|E
5|$|Twin helical strands {{form the}} DNA backbone. Another double helix {{may be found}} tracing the spaces, or grooves, between the strands. These voids are {{adjacent}} to the base pairs and <b>may</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> binding site. As the strands are not symmetrically located with respect to each other, the grooves are unequally sized. One groove, the major groove, is 22Å wide and the other, the minor groove, is 12Å wide. The width of the major groove means that {{the edges of the}} bases are more accessible in the major groove than in the minor groove. As a result, proteins such as transcription factors that can bind to specific sequences in double-stranded DNA usually make contact with the sides of the bases exposed in the major groove. This situation varies in unusual conformations of DNA within the cell (see below), but the major and minor grooves are always named to reflect the differences in size that would be seen if the DNA is twisted back into the ordinary B form.|$|E

25|$|Phenobarbital {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of all types of seizures except absence seizures. It is no less effective at seizure control than phenytoin, however phenobarbital is not as well tolerated. Phenobarbital <b>may</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> clinical advantage over carbamazepine for treating partial onset seizures. Carbamazepine <b>may</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> clinical advantage over phenobarbital for generalized onset tonic-clonic seizures. Its very long active half-life means for some people doses {{do not have to be}} taken every day, particularly once the dose has been stabilized over a period of several weeks or months, and seizures are effectively controlled.|$|E
