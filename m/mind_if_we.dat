[...] To my <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can take this spirit out of high school with us it means more to us than our Latin or Greek.

2500|$|Right upon {{setting up}} camp in Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, Romanian troops joined the Wehrmacht and the Schutzstaffel-organized Einsatzgruppen in mass shootings of Bessarabian and Ukrainian Jews, {{resulting}} {{in the deaths of}} 10,000 to 20,000 people. Scholar Christopher R. Browning compares these killings with similar atrocities perpetrated by locals in Reichskommissariat Ukraine, Lithuania and Latvia (see Holocaust in Latvia, Holocaust in Lithuania, Holocaust in Ukraine). From then on, as the fighting troops progressed over the Dniester, the local administration deported large numbers of Jews into the fighting zone, in hopes that they would be exterminated by the Germans. Antonescu himself stated: [...] "I am in favor of expelling the Jews from Bessarabia and [...] Bukovina {{to the other side of}} the border [...] There is nothing for them to do here and I don't <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> appear in history as barbarians [...] There has never been a time more suitable in our history to get rid of the Jews, and if necessary, you are to make use of machine guns against them." [...] He also explained that his aim was: [...] "the policy of purification of the Romanian race, and I will not give way before any obstacle in achieving this historical goal of our nation. If we do not take advantage of the situation which presents itself today [...] we shall miss the last chance that history offers to us. And I do not wish to miss it, because if I do so further generations will blame me." [...] He made a contradictory statement about the murder of Jews in Chișinău, claiming that their perpetrators were [...] "bastards" [...] who [...] "stained" [...] his regime's reputation. Antonescu saw the [...] "war" [...] against the Jews as being just as important as the war against the Soviet Union, and regularly demanded reports from his officers in Bessarabia and Transnistria about their measures against the Jews. In late August 1941 in Tighina Antonescu called a secret conference attended by himself, the governors of Bessarabia and Bukovina and the governor-designate of Transnistria to discuss his plans regarding the Jews in those regions.|$|E
