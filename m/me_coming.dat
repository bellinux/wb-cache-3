We don't know what's going to end up on the album but it was an absolute you know honor... For me being such a fan for so long it was so exciting to hear her vocal in the room right next to <b>me,</b> <b>coming</b> out of her head really sounding exactly like all those records we all love and she's a pleasure to work with because she's so in tune with who she is and what she wants to sing. I don't know. It's really great collaborating with her and Natalia is such a great writer.|$|E

During a post-game interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), he commented that [...] "someday, someone's {{going to make him}} eat his lunch. This is something, in my opinion, that the players should take care of." [...] Recchi also mentioned revenge, not specifically from the Flyers, during an interview with the CBC. [...] "It doesn't surprise <b>me</b> <b>coming</b> from this guy. He's that type of player. He's done it before. It might not come from our team. But he better protect himself," [...] said Recchi.|$|E

Mortimer said that Paralympic athletes received no prize money, despite thousands of dollars given {{by the government to}} winning Olympians and their coaches. She told The Hamilton Spectator, [...] "We get {{a pat on the back}} and a good job note from Stephen Harper. It's upsetting.

500|$|When {{asked about}} how he comes up with song titles, McKinnon said: [...] "I've got my iPhone, and I go on my notes and every time I see {{something}} I like I write it down, {{so a lot of}} the time titles are something that mean something to us only, or to someone I know only." [...] He called What Separates Me from You [...] "the slowest for stuff like that", when referring to song titles. Westfall said that the album's title and the songs' subjects were about [...] "Separating your self from your peers and really coming into your own." [...] McKinnon said What Separates Me from You was [...] "a lot more personal and darker" [...] than Homesick, and that it was [...] "a natural progression of what we were doing" [...] with [...] "the same core" [...] as the band's preceding albums. Asked whether the album reached new heights, he said it [...] "was definitely the next step" [...] for the band. However, the band originally had no idea on how the album would turn out: [...] "It was a little bit all over the place, because of <b>me</b> <b>coming</b> in, Tom [...] leaving and all this new stuff that was going on", as stated by guitarist Kevin Skaff. Skaff said that McKinnon originally really wanted to name the album Always the Hard Way, but later realized that the hardcore band Terror had already used that title for an album.|$|E
500|$|An ode to oral sex, [...] "Blow" [...] {{stands in}} line with the {{explicit}} theme of the album about frank female sexuality and eroticism. Lyrically, it refers to cunnilingus through heavy innuendos omitting subtlety; the lines [...] "Can you lick my Skittles, it's the sweetest in the middle/ Pink is the flavor, solve the riddle" [...] are sung [...] "flirtatiously" [...] by Beyoncé. It opens with a breathy atmosphere and Beyoncé singing the lines, [...] "I kiss you and you lick your lips/ You like it wet and so do I/ I know you never waste a drip/ I wonder how it feels sometimes". The chorus lines are [...] "pleaded" [...] by the singer as stated by Fallon: [...] "Keep <b>me</b> <b>coming,</b> keep me going, keep me humming, keep me moaning". The second half of the song contains a tempo change with a funkier beat and the singer singing verse-chorus-verse trajectories. Chris Richards of The Washington Post compared this type of songcraft with Maxwell, Erykah Badu and Frank Ocean's work. It starts with Beyoncé declaring [...] "I'm about to get into this girls. This for all my grown women out there". During this part, Timbaland's vocals can be heard in the background as part of a call and response. It follows with Beyoncé singing the lines [...] "I can't wait 'til I get home so you can turn that cherry out" [...] to her man; according to Caitlin White of the website The 405, these line [...] "exhibit deep assurance of her usual freedom". During the second part, the lines [...] "turn that cherry out" [...] are repeatedly sung followed by the lyrics [...] "I'm-a let you be the boss of me". She finishes the second part by delivering, [...] "Don't slip off when it drip off on top of you... Gimme that daddy-long stroke". The second part was further described as a [...] "masterful recreation of mid-'80s First Avenue funk". At the end [...] "Blow" [...] features a French-language interlude.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the final}} game of the month Vancouver played the Rangers and former coach Alain Vigneault. Daniel Sedin said of the game: [...] "I know our former coach is over there, but once you get into the game you're not going to think too much about it. He was with us for seven years and he meant a lot to this franchise, so it's going to be fun seeing him again but once the game gets going we want the two points, and so does he". Tortarella stated: [...] "I'm not going to lie, it's a little weird for <b>me</b> <b>coming</b> back, but once the game starts, it's about playing and {{trying to find a way}} to get a win". The Canucks lost the game 5–2, {{finishing}} the month with 31 points, four points out of the final playoff spot.|$|E
2500|$|Hynde and Honeyman-Scott {{have both}} {{acknowledged}} the influence their contrasting styles had {{on each other}} (Guitar Player, 1981; Uncut, 1999). According to Honeyman-Scott, Hynde had a unique style he adjusted to in several ways: [...] "She does {{quite a bit of}} rhythm guitar, and I don't know anybody who plays like her. It's real distinct, and I can't count her beat half the time. Instead, I just put a little guitar line over it, like the lick in 'Tattooed Love Boys'" [...] (Guitar Player, 1981). He joked about his other strategy: [...] "I've never told them I can't work out their time at all! They are used to <b>me</b> <b>coming</b> in a bar too late; they think that's the way I play. But it's because I've missed where she comes in! I just bluff it and hope for the best." ...|$|E

Lawrence Luster of the Daily Star took the picture and put in the library. Soon after, their sister paper, the Daily Express, were looking for a picture of me playing for West Ham, and found the one of me in the United shirt in the pile. They published it and all hell broke loose. [...] "I came back from holiday to discover West Ham fans were going mad. It wasn't really my fault. I was only a kid, I did what my agent told me to do, then took all the crap for it." ...|$|E

We may not have that answer for our fans, which is disappointing, but we did try, and that's more than a lot of people." [...] O'Day said that though she is pursuing her own career as a solo artist, she would never turn down the chance to get onstage with her former bandmates. [...] "I have so much respect for that situation, if there was ever interest in <b>me</b> <b>coming</b> back ... and making music with the girls, I would never say no to something like that," [...] she said. [...] "In regards to the other negativity, I really just chose not to comment," [...] said O'Day. [...] "I wrote a blog on my MySpace page, and if anyone wants to know how I feel, they can go there." [...] O'Day later seemed to have more of a positive feeling about the whole situation. She stated, [...] "After being kicked out, I learned you have to fight to stay happy, and that takes forgiveness of yourself." ...|$|E

2500|$|Greg Vaughan, who had {{recently}} been let go from his role as Diego Guittierez on The Young and the Restless, was cast shortly thereafter and first appeared on February 20, 2003. Vaughan later described his screen test to Soap Opera Digest: [...] "I {{was a little bit}} intimidated. I knew about the character, the foundation of the story. I knew it was a difficult task that I was about to take on." [...] In July 2009, Vaughan denied rumors that he was being let go or put on recurring status. That September, ABC announced that Vaughan had decided to leave to explore other opportunities, and that Jackson would be reprising the role. However, Vaughan announced via Twitter that it was the network that decided to let him go. Jackson stated upon returning: [...] "It was a tough situation. I was not under any sort of headspace that someone was losing their job; it was that the role was opening up. (...) It was more of a confusing thing for <b>me</b> <b>coming</b> back and not knowing exactly what was going on, {{on the other end of}} things."

2500|$|On lap 146, Matt Kenseth {{took the}} lead from Sadler a lap after the action resumed. Almirola was then spun by Kasey Kahne after Almirola made contact with Sam Hornish, Jr. on the backstretch. At this time, rain began to fall on the track under the yellow. On lap 152, the cars came into pit road under the red flag. Some drivers exited their cars while others, {{including}} Kenseth, remained in theirs. During the red flag period, asked what happened with Brian Vickers, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. said, [...] "I got a run on him and (Vickers) saw <b>me</b> <b>coming.</b> I had a big old run on him and I went to the inside. I didn't try to make no late move and {{make some kind of}} surprise or anything. I just kind of ease on over and he went to block me and hit me in the fender sending us both off, sent me down into the grass and I tried to recover my car. I got back into him coming back into the racetrack." [...] When asked what happened was accidental, Earnhardt, Jr. was unrepentant and said, [...] "Yeah, it was accidental. I didn't want to wreck the field." [...] The drivers and fans did not buy Earnhardt Jr.'s excuse and to this day Vickers, the drivers, and fans {{do not believe that the}} crash was accidental.
