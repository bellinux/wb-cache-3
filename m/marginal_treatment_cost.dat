This survey collected data about 488 industrialfacilities located in the river basin area. The survey had the following goals: a) providing a general characterization of the role of water in industrial plants; and b) assessing the financial and environmental impacts of the implementation of watercharges in the basin, through the analysis of firms? water demand behaviour andeffluent treatment costs. Results suggest that water charges may attain satisfactoryresults in terms of water resources conservation while not implying in significant costincreases to the firms. On the other hand, <b>marginal</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>cost</b> estimations are farabove the proposed charge levels for effluent discharge. This indicates that, at leastduring the initial implementation period, water charges will not be an effectivemechanism to induce firms to undertake pollution control measures. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we assume}} that a {{professional}} pollutant treatment enterprise treats all of the pollutants emitted by multiple {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs). In order to determine the treatment price, SMEs can bargain with the pollutant treatment enterprise individually, or through forming alliances. We propose a bargaining game model of centralized pollutant treatment to study how the pollutant treatment price is determined through negotiation. Then, we consider that there is a moral hazard from SMEs in centralized pollutant treatment; in other words, they may break their agreement concerning their quantities of production and pollutant emissions with the pollutant treatment enterprise. We study how the pollutant treatment enterprise can prevent this by pricing mechanism design. It is found that the pollutant treatment enterprise can prevent SMEs’ moral hazard through tiered pricing. If the <b>marginal</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>cost</b> of the pollutant treatment enterprise is a constant, SMEs could bargain with the pollutant treatment enterprise individually, otherwise, they should form a grand alliance to bargain with it as a whole...|$|E
40|$|Water utility {{pricing and}} {{investment}} planning involves decisions on (1) {{when and how}} much to invest in additional capacity, and (2) the determination of fixed charges, volumetric charges, and connection fees for several classes of customers with different patterns of use and demand characteristics. These decisions have to be reached under certain political, financial, and administrative constraints. Given the complexity of the issue, the traditional approach for water utility management has relied on financial rather than economic criteria, with little attention being given to the complementary nature of the services provided by water and wastewater utilities. Conventional practices, therefore, produces inefficiency and less than optimal proportionality in capacity design between the water supply and wastewater treatment systems. Recognizing the drawbacks of conventional practices and the limitations of earlier studies, a theoretical framework for optimum rate design and capacity expansion for a combined water supply-wastewater treatment system has been produced in this research. Several variations of the model have been presented to deal with the specific problems of: (a) administrative and social constraints; (b) financial recovery; (c) the determination of connection fees; and (d) volumetric charges for different classes of customers. In general, practical alternatives to the traditional approach can be classified into (i) marginal cost pricing schemes; and (ii) constant price-capacity expansion strategies. The short-run marginal cost includes the marginal supply cost, <b>marginal</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>cost,</b> and the marginal environmental damage cost; the constant real price is a weighted average of that present value of short-run marginal costs and the marginal annual benefits of additional capacity in both systems. While marginal cost pricing-capacity expansion policy tends to maximize the present value of the social net benefits associated with water utility services, it is not a feasible alternative to conventional practices. The resulting variation in prices overtime is neither administratively feasible nor politically acceptable. The constant (real) price and capacity expansion strategy, on the other hand, seems to overcome most of the deficiencies with the traditional approach, and the shortcomings of marginal cost pricing policy. Finally, a practical procedure for the implementation of constant (real) pricing-capacity expansion strategy has been suggested in this study. N/A 350 p...|$|E

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in cross-border medical care and its comparative advantages. In addition, medical care {{can be defined as}} a local assurance good. Little research is being carried out in this field. This paper discusses the individual considerations for medical treatment offered at home and abroad within a micro-economical framework. Specific assumptions as mistrust, monetary and non-monetary transaction-costs, a price and cost gradient, illness severity as well as a lump-sum insurance are discussed. We show that a demand abroad can be utility maximizing, however, only second best. There are inefficiencies in the dimensions of ex-post demand and income risk either on the side of gross-income or of costs. Furthermore, the foreign demand is restricted for low health stages driven by mistrust and restrictions in quality. Higher stages are more capable if fixed costs are low. To demand abroad the <b>marginal</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>costs</b> abroad must fall short of a threshold level. Finally, an out-of-pocket payment can reduce the moral hazard when treatment takes place abroad. [...] cross-border medical care,health tourism,efficiency,patient migration,trust...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{uses the}} <b>marginal</b> <b>treatment</b> effect (MTE) to unify and {{organize}} the econometric {{literature on the}} evaluation of social programs. The <b>marginal</b> <b>treatment</b> effect is a choice-theoretic parameter that {{can be interpreted as}} a willingness to pay parameter for persons at a margin of indifference between participating in an activity or not. All of the conventional treatment parameters as well as the more economically motivated treatment effects can be generated from a baseline <b>marginal</b> <b>treatment</b> effect. All of the estimation methods used in the applied evaluation literature, such as matching, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity methods, selection and control function methods, make assumptions about the <b>marginal</b> <b>treatment</b> effect which we exposit. Models for multiple outcomes are developed. Empirical examples of the leading methods are presented. Methods are presented for bounding treatment effects in partially identified models, when the <b>marginal</b> <b>treatment</b> effect is known only over a limited support. We show how to use the <b>marginal</b> <b>treatment</b> in econometric <b>cost</b> benefit analysis, in defining limits of policy experiments, in constructing the average <b>marginal</b> <b>treatment</b> effect, and in forecasting the effects of programs in new environments. ...|$|R
40|$|The study {{evaluates the}} {{economic}} {{costs and benefits}} of improving tuberculosis control interventions in Thailand. Provider costs are determined on the basis of <b>marginal</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>costs</b> for varying case numbers and estimates of the cost of required infrastructure changes. Indirect costs are calculated as income lost due to morbidity and premature mortality. An epidemiological model is used to calculate case numbers and mortality under current control conditions and a scenario of improved control. An improved control strategy initially leads to a higher number of detected cases. For longer projection periods, the epidemiological impact of curing a higher proportion of infectious sources results in lower case numbers than those expected without programme improvement. Model simulations show a reduction of total annual case numbers through improved control measures by an average 45 % after a simulation period of 20 years. The corresponding societal savings in form of reduced indirect costs from the disease are U. S. $ 2. 4 billion. Reductions in direct provider costs can be expected as a result of decreased numbers of detected cases for longer evaluation periods, as well as a lower proportion of multi-drug-resistant cases. The mean value of predicted savings is U. S. $ 8. 3 million. Since this value is likely to be higher than the required investment in improved infrastructure, net savings can be expected. The result of an uncertainty analysis shows a wide range of potential additional costs or net savings with respect to direct provider costs.

40|$|AIM—To study prospectively {{the outcome}} of {{conservative}} and surgical treatment of chalazia provided by medical and nursing staff.  METHODS—During a 5  month recruitment period all patients attending a district general eye hospital for treatment of chalazion {{were included in the}} study. 129  patients (217  visits) with chalazia were seen by either a senior nurse or a trainee ophthalmologist (senior house officer, SHO) or both. Patients received either conservative treatment or eversion of the eyelid with incision and curettage. Patients were mailed a questionnaire asking them if their cyst had resolved and how they rated their <b>treatment.</b> <b>Marginal</b> <b>cost</b> analysis was used to determine the <b>cost</b> of <b>treatment.</b>  RESULTS—The outcome of treatment could be determined in 170  of the 217  visits. Conservative treatment was successful for 29 % of cysts while surgical treatment was successful for 72 %. There {{was no significant difference in}} treatment outcome between nurse and SHO groups. Patients found nurse treatment acceptable with a high level of patient satisfaction. The <b>marginal</b> <b>cost</b> of <b>treatment</b> by a nurse was £ 9. 91 per cyst compared with £ 12. 10 for SHOs. There were no surgical complications and no evidence of malignancy in six biopsies.  CONCLUSIONS—Surgical treatment of chalazion is safe and effective and successfully treats approximately three quarters of selected cysts. With conservative treatment approximately one third of selected chalazia will resolve within 3  months. Nurse treatment of chalazion is safe, effective, and acceptable to patients. ...|$|R
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] The {{aim was to}} {{estimate}} costs and yields of faecal occult blood screening and rescreening for colorectal cancer, for differing age cohorts. DESIGN [...] Cost and clinical data were {{used as the basis}} for modelling the expected costs, and cost savings, resulting from the treatment of screen detected cancers, as compared with cancers detected by symptomatic presentation. SETTING [...] Data were derived from the MRC screening trial currently in progress in Nottingham. PARTICIPANTS [...] Approximately 140, 000 subjects, age 50 - 79 years, were randomly allocated to a test (screened) and a control (unscreened) group. MAIN RESULTS [...] The net costs of detecting and treating a cancer following colorectal screening fall as the age of the target population increases, owing principally to the increasing incidence of the disease with age. Generally, the <b>marginal</b> detection and <b>treatment</b> <b>costs</b> falls for all age groups with the first screening round, but rises considerably with the second. If allowance is made for cancers prevented as a result of early detection and excision of adenomas, the costs of screening are substantially reduced for all age groups. CONCLUSIONS [...] Assuming a cost per QALY (quality adjusted life year gained) equivalent to that derived for the breast cancer screening programme, and a QALY gain from colorectal screening of one year, three screens, each separated by two years, appear economically justified for populations aged 60 years and above. Expected gains from cancer prevention make two screens justifiable for those between 45 and 59 years of age...|$|R

40|$|Background: Pedestrian {{injuries}} frequently {{result in}} high injury severity, which {{is associated with}} high <b>treatment</b> <b>costs.</b> Identification of characteristics associated with high injury severity and <b>treatment</b> <b>costs</b> is important to reduce mortality and economic burden. Previous {{studies have focused on}} the prevalence of pedestrian trauma, but few have estimated the cost of pedestrian trauma and identified factors associated with acute <b>treatment</b> <b>cost.</b> Aim: This study aimed to delineate the acute <b>treatment</b> <b>costs</b> associated with pedestrian trauma in New South Wales (NSW), and determine patient, injury, and outcome characteristics that are associated with <b>treatment</b> <b>costs.</b> Method: Road trauma hospital admissions from twelve major trauma centres in NSW were extracted from a state-wide trauma costs database. Road trauma was categorised by mechanism of injury: pedestrians, pedal cyclists, motor vehicle collisions, and motor bicycle collisions. Pedestrian patient, injury and outcome characteristics were compared to the other road trauma groups. Acute <b>treatment</b> <b>costs</b> were described and a multivariate linear regression analysis was used to determine predictors of pedestrian <b>treatment</b> <b>costs.</b> Results: Of the 3, 707 road trauma patients identified between 2008 and 2009, there were 635 pedestrians hospitalised. Children under the age of 16, and older patients greater than > 75 years, had the highest prevalence of pedestrian trauma. In comparison to other road user groups, pedestrians had significantly higher injury severity scores, and traumatic brain injury. The median cost per patient was $ 5, 619 (IQR $ 2, 553 -$ 15, 459), in comparison with motor vehicle collisions, which was $ 4, 454 (IQR $ 2, 028 -$ 11, 299). Increased length of hospital stay, admission to the intensive care unit and traumatic brain injury, were identified as predictors of high pedestrian <b>treatment</b> <b>cost.</b> The number of body regions injured and age were not significantly associated with reduced <b>treatment</b> <b>costs</b> (β = -$ 569. 14 and -$ 57. 47 respectively). Conclusions: Pedestrians are more severely injured in comparison to other road user groups with injuries occurring predominately in children and the elderly. Pedestrian trauma is an economic burden to the health care system.

40|$|This study {{presents}} an innovative modelling scheme that can effectively optimise acid fracturing treatment. The scheme {{consists of a}} fracture geometry model, a thermo-kinetic model, a production model, an economic model, and an optimisation algorithm. Acid penetration distance was found to increase {{with the increase in}} injection rate, decrease in leakoff rate, and decrease in formation temperature. Fracture width increases with the increase in injection time and acid concentration. Fracture conductivity and half-length are used in the production model to estimate cumulative gas production over a period. Then, the economic model estimates <b>treatment</b> <b>cost</b> and net present value (NPV). An optimisation algorithm, based on the combined features of Genetic Algorithm and Evolutionary Operation, is used to maximise an objective function by manipulating free design variables. The effects of three objective functions − maximum NPV, maximum cumulative production and maximum NPV with minimum <b>treatment</b> <b>cost</b> on optimum acid fracturing design were investigated. A design based on maximum NPV yields almost the same cumulative production as that for maximum cumulative production but less <b>treatment</b> <b>cost.</b> In addition, a design based on maximum NPV with minimum <b>treatment</b> <b>cost</b> results in up to 19 % saving in <b>treatment</b> <b>cost</b> with less than 1 % loss in NPV.
