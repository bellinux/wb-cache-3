However, the first system formed on April18, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> before the official start. Three more depressions formed before June1; however, none attained storm intensity. The first named storm {{of the year was}} Hurricane Alice which formed on July1 and became the first known cyclone to affect Bermuda during July. <b>More</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> later, the second hurricane, Brenda, formed and was considered the worst storm to strike Mexico along the eastern coast of the Bay of Campeche, killing 10 people.|$|E

50|$|At least 43 {{people were}} killed after <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>month's</b> worth of rain fell in {{southern}} Madeira in five hours during a strong Atlantic winter storm, producing severe flooding and mudslides. The unusual storm was fed by warmer-than-normal sea surface temperatures in the Northeastern Atlantic related to El Niño, and a slowing of the North Atlantic Gyre.|$|R
5|$|Hazard maps {{showing that}} Armero would be {{completely}} flooded after an eruption were distributed <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> before the eruption, but the Colombian Congress criticized the scientific and civil defense agencies for scaremongering. The eruption occurred {{at the height of}} guerrilla warfare in Bogotá, Colombia's capital, and so the government and army were occupied {{at the time of the}} eruption.|$|E
5|$|In {{her final}} years, Santoso and Sastrosatomo lived off of their {{pensions}} in Jakarta; in her obituary, Tempo magazine {{reported that the}} pension was barely enough for day-to-day expenses.

5|$|Spicer took {{written and}} oral {{testimony}} {{from a number}} of witnesses over <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>month.</b> Accounts by both participants and eye-witnesses were contradictory.

5|$|With the new {{campaign}} already underway, Niemer was replaced as UB-16s commander by Oblt. Hugo Thielmann on 18 March.

The 107-ton Dutch motor vessel Arie was sunk in the Hoofden area on 20 April; there were no reports of casualties.|$|E
5|$|Although IFA {{can be used}} {{to confirm}} {{infection}} in these ambiguous cases, this assay is not widely used. In general, a second specimen should be collected <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> later and retested for persons with indeterminate western blot results. Although much less commonly available, nucleic acid testing (e.g., viral RNA or proviral DNA amplification method) can also help diagnosis in certain situations. In addition, a few tested specimens might provide inconclusive results because of a low quantity specimen. In these situations, a second specimen is collected and tested for HIV infection.|$|E

5|$|In this episode, {{paranoia}} {{takes over}} {{the members of the}} office as downsizing rumors swirl. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) forms a Survivor-esque alliance with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) against the other employees—later adding Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) also. Meanwhile, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) arranges a morale-boosting birthday party for Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery)—although her birthday is <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> away. Michael agonizes over writing the perfect greeting in her birthday card, and in the end, his joke falls flat, ruining the party.|$|E
5|$|On May 27, 2004, a {{judge ruled}} {{that the police had}} {{reasonable}} justification to raid Goliath's. Defense lawyers countered that none of the anonymous information the police acted uponfor example that live sex shows were being staged and drugs sold on the premisesfeatured in the charges made against the seventeen men. They also pointed out that the police failed to call in the force's gay community liaison officer. Goliath's reopened a little <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> after the raid.|$|E

In Soledad, the General agrees to see a physician for the first time.|$|E
50|$|Imprisonment is {{not just}} a pretty good proof of guilt, but can {{frustrate}} the contract if for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> few <b>months,</b> which would bring the contract to an end without the need for procedure or compensation. Being held on remand could justify a short spell of suspension on full pay, but if this is without pay or for too long (<b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> few <b>months)</b> it creates <b>a</b> constructive dismissal. The employer may simply {{be able to say that}} a court has decided there was sufficient probability of guilt to lock him up and this informed its investigation, justifying dismissal.|$|R

5|$|Whitfield {{recorded}} the song with Marvin Gaye over five sessions, {{the first on}} February 3, 1967, and the final one on April 10, 1967. Recordings of this version took <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> due to Whitfield overdubbing Gaye's vocals {{with that of the}} Andantes' background vocals, mixing in several tracks featuring the Funk Brothers on the rhythm track, and adding the string section from the Detroit Symphony Orchestra with an arrangement by Paul Riser.|$|E
5|$|If {{signs of}} {{disturbance}} are present for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> {{but less than}} six months, the diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder is applied. Psychotic symptoms lasting {{less than a month}} may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, and various conditions may be classed as psychotic disorder not otherwise specified, while schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. If the psychotic symptoms are the direct physiological result of a general medical condition or a substance, then the diagnosis is one of a psychosis secondary to that condition. Schizophrenia is not diagnosed if symptoms of pervasive developmental disorder are present unless prominent delusions or hallucinations are also present.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Reed, who {{was trying}} to get home, was unable to get State Department {{clearance}} for a visa and was detained in Oslo (then called Christiana), Norway, for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>month.</b> His letters were censored, and Bryant did not hear from him directly until April. On orders from Edgar Sisson of the U.S. Commission on Public Information, all of Reed's papers were confiscated when he arrived in New York on April 28. Unable to write about the October Revolution without his notes, Reed instead gave speeches advocating U.S. recognition of the new Russian government.

5|$|She, {{along with}} the {{remaining}} members of the Imperial Family, was sent into exile after a coup d'état staged by a clique of army officers in 1889. Being cast from her beloved adopted land had a devastating effect on Teresa Cristina's spirit and health. Grieving and ill, she died of respiratory failure leading to cardiac arrest little <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> after the monarchy's collapse. She was greatly loved by her subjects, both during her lifetime and afterwards. She was even respected by the Republicans who overthrew the Empire. Despite having had no direct impact on Brazil's political history, Teresa Cristina is well regarded by historians not only for her character and irreproachable behavior, but also for her sponsorship of Brazilian culture.|$|E
5|$|The Atlantic {{hurricane}} season officially began on June1, but activity in 1985 began <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> {{and a half}} later with the formation of Tropical Storm Ana on July15. It was an average season in which 13tropical depressions formed. Eleven of the depressions attained tropical storm status and seven of these attained hurricane status. In addition, three tropical cyclone eventually attained major hurricane status, which is slightly above the 1981–2010 average of 2.7per season. The amount of activity is attributed to a La Niña that persisted since the previous season. Seven hurricanes and two tropical storms made landfall during the season, causing 302deaths and $5.54billion in damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{determined}} {{resolution of}} the small party which held this small post for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> against so comparatively large a force, must surely wring admiration from every voice, especially when {{the horrors of the}} latter portion of this time are considered; the dismal spectacle of their slaughtered comrades, the sufferings of their women and children thus immured with themselves, and the hopelessness of relief, which destroyed any other motive for their obstinate defence they made, than that resulting from a high sense of duty, supported by unsubdued courage. This, and a generous spirit of courtesy towards their enemy, certainly marked the character of the garrison of Kalunga, during the period of its siege.|$|E
60|$|When all was ready, Spike mustered his crew, {{and made}} a speech. He told the men {{that he was about}} a job that was out of the usual line of their duty, and that he knew they had a right to expect extra pay for such extra work.

If he succeeded, their reward would be a doubloon a man, which would be earning <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>month's</b> wages by twenty-four hours' work. This was enough. The men wanted to hear no more; but they cheered their commander, and set about their task in the happiest disposition possible.|$|R
