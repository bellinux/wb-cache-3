25|$|As {{early as}} 1850, the {{inhabitants}} of the hamlet of La Croix du Bac, which is included as a part of Steenwerck, but is just over a <b>mile</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> road, had designed a project to build a church, despite opposition from the parish priest of Steenwerck, {{as well as from the}} town council and local merchants. A plot of land was offered by Mr. Amand Chieux. Some residents of La Croix du Bac gave money, others gave their labour and materials: and, so the Church of Our Lady of Sorrows was built.|$|E

500|$|Not all reviews were positive, however. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five, writing that [...] "'The Beginning' opens witty enough [...] and then offers the viewer no substance. It's a better season opener than 'Redux' [...] but it's still very poor." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely {{negative}} review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. She derided the episode's plot, noting that the episode was [...] "another <b>mile</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> X-Files Road of Mythology. Monster aliens? This is {{something out of a}} schlocky pulp novel with the science of the show dissolved into complete technobabble".|$|E
500|$|De Laurentiis visited Ridley Scott {{on the set}} of Gladiator and {{suggested}} to Ridley he read the novel he had bought the rights to. Scott was in the third week before principal photography was due to finish on Gladiator. Gladiator became a commercial and critical success, earning 12 Academy Award nominations. De Laurentiis asked Scott if he would like to direct the film version of Hannibal. Scott misunderstood which Hannibal he meant, thinking De Laurentiis was speaking of the general and historical figure from Carthage who nearly brought down the Roman Empire back around 200 B.C., so he replied: [...] "Basically, Dino, I'm doing a Roman epic right now. I don't wanna do elephants coming over the Alps next, old boy." [...] Scott read the manuscript in four sittings within a week, believing it to be a [...] "symphony", and expressed his desire to do it. Scott further explains how he got involved: [...] "I was shooting Gladiator in Malta and one day, for the hell of it, I went for a walk for half a <b>mile</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> road to the Malta Film Studio to see my old buddy Dino. I had not seen him since I'd worked on a version of Dune. This was pre-Blade Runner. Dino had pursued me to direct Dune and another film. He's always enthusiastic and aggressive and came after me when I did both Blade Runner and Alien, but I couldn't do the films. Anyway, we had an espresso together and a few days later, he called me to ask if he could visit the Gladiator set. He arrived with a manuscript of Hannibal, about a month before it was published in book form. He said: 'Let's make this one.' I haven't read anything so fast since The Godfather. It was so rich in all kind of ways." ...|$|E
