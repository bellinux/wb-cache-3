The document was signed by such figures as Domela Nieuwenhuis, Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, Luigi Bertoni, Saul Yanovsky, Harry Kelly, Thomas Keell, Lilian Wolfe, Rudolf Rocker, and George Barrett. It was also endorsed by Errico Malatesta and Alexander Schapiro, two of three secretaries elected to their position at the Anarchist International of 1907. It set out several viewpoints, including that all wars {{were the result of}} the current system of society, and therefore not the blame of any particular government; did not regard a defensive and offensive war as being fundamentally distinctly different; and encouraged all anarchists to support only class conflict and the liberation of oppressed populaces as a <b>means</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> to resolve wars between nation-states.|$|E

She said that, while she would not interfere with any deputy clerk who issues marriage licenses, she would not personally issue or authorize any of the forms. She created several altered versions of the Kentucky marriage license form and instructed her deputy clerks to use them, which had her name and reference to the clerk's office removed. The ACLU sued Davis separately for these form alterations, which they found to be of questionable legality.

Governor Beshear acknowledged that Kentucky would recognize the licenses being issued, but he could not verify the legality of the licenses issued or the <b>means</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> the marriage licenses were altered.

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we {{address the problem of}} {{distance}} measurement in indoor IEEE 802. 11 WLANs. The Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and the Signal Propagation Time (SPT) have been widely used for distance estimation in indoor WLAN deployments. However, neither approach by itself is accurate. Moreover, there is no <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> WLAN nodes know whether the estimated distance is accurate or not. In this work we propose a multi-measurement approach. Specifically, we combine an RSSI and a propagation time- based schemes and utilize both results for mutual cross-validation to improve the estimation accuracy and reduce the number of false decisions based on errored estimations. The performance of our combined mechanism has been evaluated through real experiments. I...|$|R

The importance of the sea to maritime nations is shown by the intrusions it makes into their culture; its inclusion in myth and legend; its mention in proverbs and folk song; the use of ships in votive offerings; the importance of ships and the sea in initiation ceremonies and in mortuary rites; children playing with toy boats; adults making model ships; crowds gathering at the launch of a new ship; people congregating at the arrival or departure of a vessel and the general attitude towards maritime matters.

Statistical models of the observed orbits of long-period comets argue that the galactic tide is the principal <b>means</b> <b>by</b> <b>which</b> their orbits are perturbed toward the inner Solar System.|$|E
