25|$|Mudflaps are now rarely {{specified}} {{as standard}} on production cars as they {{interfere with the}} clean airflow around the vehicle. For larger vehicles such as trucks, mud flaps are still important for their control of spray, and in 2010 {{a new version of}} the <b>mud</b> <b>flap</b> was introduced that has been shown to create significantly less aerodynamic drag than standard mud flaps.|$|E
50|$|If included, the fender (or just a <b>mud</b> <b>flap)</b> {{helps to}} protect the cargo and the towing bicycle from road spray and dirt. On {{heavy-duty}} trailers, the fender may be designed {{to be capable of}} bearing heavy loads.|$|E

50|$|By {{the time}} {{he came to a}} flooded river to wait for the water to subside, he lost his lead as all others caught up with him. Nick Nowicki in his Peugeot 404 took the lead with Bert Shankland in the same car behind, but his car {{suffered}} from a split sump, sustained from a damaged steering earlier on with the crew topping up oil; this meant with just three controls to go, the engine gave up. Hugh Lionet in his Peugeot 204 was excluded for fixing a <b>mud</b> <b>flap</b> at the parc fermé. Shekhar Mehta in his debut Safari driving in the same car also retired.|$|E
50|$|The {{noise level}} in the trains during tunnel {{passages}} was subject to passenger complaints. Tests in August 2005 showed that noise level reductions of 3-4 dB can be achieved with an increase of the so-called <b>mud</b> <b>flaps,</b> the rubber bands attached {{to the end of}} the intermediate cars to smooth the airflow at the articulated car joints, from a width of 100 to 143 mm. Korail then retrofitted all trains with the wider <b>mud</b> <b>flaps</b> until May 2006.|$|R

50|$|At {{a roller}} unit, the truck places {{each set of}} wheels on the rollers as it leaves the plant. At this point the washing process is {{automatically}} triggered. While the wheels of each axle are rotated automatically, water is sprayed out from strategically placed nozzles to clean the tires, wheel wells and <b>mud</b> <b>flaps.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{automotive}} design application Class A {{surfaces are}} created on all visible exterior surfaces (ex; body panels, bumper, grill, lights etc.) and all visible surfaces of see-touch & feel parts in interior (ex: Dashboard, seats, door pads etc.). This can also include beauty covers {{in the engine}} compartment, <b>mud</b> <b>flaps,</b> trunk panels and carpeting.|$|R
50|$|The various {{versions}} of the Heaphy Tin Man were functional works of art that served to promote the Heaphy family sheet metal shop and hardware store in Syracuse. The business was founded in 1892 alongside the Erie Canal, and the original product was <b>mud</b> <b>flaps</b> for horse-drawn wagons. The business gradually expanded to include sheet metal work, heating and hardware.|$|R
50|$|When it rains, or {{the track}} has {{excessive}} moisture, trainers and drivers {{are required to}} put plastic <b>mud</b> <b>flaps</b> {{on the back of}} the wheels. All race bikes must comply with the relevant procedures and standards in order to be approved. In no way can a race bike have any component that will directly interfere with another horse or driver.|$|R
50|$|Speed Carts have {{a similar}} design to race bikes in a single seat and {{stirrups}} for the driver, but have roadgoing tyres, <b>mud</b> <b>flaps,</b> longer shafts and are heavier than race bikes. Some may have a limited form of suspension built into the seat. These are usually made of steel and are heavier than race bikes but much lighter than jog carts.|$|R
50|$|The {{noise level}} in the trains during tunnel {{passages}} was also subject to passenger complaints. A reduction by 3-4 dB was achieved by retrofitting all trains with longer <b>mud</b> <b>flaps</b> at car ends until May 2006 to smooth the airflow at the articulated car joints. However, measurements in 2009 found significantly higher interior noise levels at some locations in two tunnels. Window thickness and sound insulation was improved in the KTX-II.|$|R
25|$|The {{standard}} {{trim and}} features make the VAM Javelin {{equivalent to the}} U.S. and Canadian AMC Javelin SST.

Dealer installed options included side decals, light group, map pouches, vinyl roof, locking gas cap, license plate frames, <b>mud</b> <b>flaps,</b> AM/FM radio, front disk brakes, heavy duty adjustable shocks, and many others.|$|R
50|$|Fender is the American English {{term for}} the part of an automobile, {{motorcycle}} or other vehicle body that frames a wheel well (the fender underside). Its primary purpose is to prevent sand, mud, rocks, liquids, and other road spray from being thrown into the air by the rotating tire. Fenders are typically rigid and can be damaged by contact with the road surface. Instead, flexible <b>mud</b> <b>flaps</b> are used {{close to the ground}} where contact may be possible.|$|R
50|$|A car bra {{can help}} reduce damage from minor road debris. Road spray is lessened on stone mastic asphalt and open-graded asphalt and can be further reduced with fenders (more so on a bicycle since most motor {{vehicles}} tend to already have fenders) and/or <b>mud</b> <b>flaps.</b> Street sweepers and winter service vehicles remove most solid road debris and the Adopt a Highway program also helps. Road signs and variable-message signs may warn drivers of special situations involving road debris.|$|R

5000|$|In 1992, the Aerostar Sport was {{introduced}} {{as an option}} package available for any non-Eddie Bauer Aerostar Wagon. Similar to its Chevrolet Astro RS/GMC Safari CS and Dodge Caravan ES counterparts, the Aerostar Sport was largely a cosmetic and appearance upgrade. Distinguished by their silver-accented paint and [...] "Sport" [...] pinstriping, the Sport featured integrated running boards with a color-matched front air dam and color-matched rear <b>mud</b> <b>flaps.</b> On darker colors, the front grille and chrome was painted body color.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the success}} of their go-karts, Rupp began {{manufacturing}} mini bikes beginning in 1962 until the mid 1970s. Models included the Dart Cycle, Continental, Roadster, Scrambler, Hustler, Chopper, Black Widow, Enduro, Roadster 2, Swinger, Sprint, Digger, Goat, Ram, TT-500, XL-500, XL-350 and others.

5000|$|Models include precise {{replication}} of proportions and detail of actual vehicles, including accurate moldings, logos, and name scripts. Tires are not rubber, but {{are made of}} {{the same type of}} plastic as body and chassis, though black. Models often have movable <b>mud</b> <b>flaps</b> behind rear wheels (which often are lost with play). Rather odd, and rarely seen on other miniatures of any type, are headlights often molded in white plastic as opposed to clear lenses. This may be the single most recognizable trait of the brand.|$|R

Other accessories included seat cushions and spare batteries.|$|R
50|$|Scion offered about 150 {{different}} accessories; other after-market companies {{through the}} Optōmize Scion program offer to add other accessories, as well. For example, one {{can add a}} subwoofer as well as different types of decals. The tC had offered an optional supercharger to increase power from 161 to 200 hp (120 to 150 kW), but this option was since discontinued in 2007 due to early failure of the bearings inside the centrifugal blower. All accessories are sold individually, and do not require special packages. However, some options, such as Ground Effects, do prevent other accessories (such as <b>mud</b> <b>flaps)</b> from being installed.|$|R
