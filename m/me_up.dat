5|$|Hurt by Whatsername's departure, Johnny {{longs for}} better days ahead, Tunny longs for home, and Will longs {{for all the}} things he's lost ("Wake <b>Me</b> <b>Up</b> When September Ends"). St. Jimmy appears and makes one last attempt to get Johnny's attention, but that part of Johnny has died, {{resulting}} in the metaphorical suicide of St. Jimmy ("The Death of St. Jimmy"). Johnny cleans up and gets a desk job but soon realizes {{there is no place}} for him in the city ("East 12th Street"). Will, all alone with his television, bemoans his outcast state ("Nobody Likes You"). As he finally gets up off the couch, Heather appears with her new show-off rockstar boyfriend ("Rock and Roll Girlfriend"). Will heads to the 7-Eleven to get away from them and, surprisingly, finds Johnny there. Johnny had sold his guitar for a bus ticket home. Tunny returns from the war zone (as an amputee) with the Extraordinary Girl. As Tunny introduces his friends to the Extraordinary Girl, Johnny becomes furious with him for leaving the group, but quickly forgives him and the three friends embrace. Heather and her boyfriend arrive. In an uneasy truce, she gives the baby to Will. Other friends show up to greet the three men they haven't seen in a year ("We're Coming Home Again"). One year later, Johnny laments that he lost the love of his life, but he accepts that he can live inside the struggle between rage and love that has defined his life. With this acceptance comes the possibility of hope ("Whatsername").|$|E

25|$|My Father Will Guide <b>Me</b> <b>up</b> a Rope to the Sky is the {{eleventh}} studio album by Swans released on September 23, 2010; {{it was their}} first studio recording in 14 years. Swans founder Michael Gira funded the recording of this album by creating the limited-edition album I Am Not Insane and chose several collaborators from previous Swans line-ups {{as well as his}} side project Angels of Light to record and tour for this album. My Father Will Guide <b>Me</b> <b>up</b> a Rope to the Sky has received positive critical feedback for the return of Swans as well as the rich spiritual themes of the lyrics.|$|E

25|$|Tie <b>Me</b> <b>Up!</b> Tie Me Down! {{made its}} world premiere at the Berlin Film Festival to a {{polarized}} critical reaction. In the USA, the film received an X rating by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), and the {{stigma attached to}} the X rating marginalized {{the distribution of the}} film in the country. Miramax, who distributed the film in the US, filed a lawsuit against the MPAA over the X rating, but lost in court. However, in September 1990, the MPAA replaced the X rating with the NC-17 rating. This was helpful to films of explicit nature, like Tie <b>Me</b> <b>Up!</b> Tie Me Down!, that were previously categorized with pornography because of the X rating.|$|E

25|$|Rather than {{populate}} the film with many characters, {{as in his}} previous films, here the story focuses on the compelling relationship at its center: the actress and her kidnapper literally struggling for power and desperate for love. The film's title line Tie <b>Me</b> <b>Up!</b> is unexpectedly uttered by the actress as a genuine request. She does not know if she will try to escape or not, and when she realizes she has feelings for her captor, she prefers not {{to be given a}} chance. In spite of some dark elements, Tie <b>Me</b> <b>Up!</b> Tie Me Down! can be described as a romantic comedy, and the director's most clear love story, with a plot similar to William Wyler's thriller The Collector.|$|E

I was very nearsighted and couldn't see the audience. I thought that the people didn't like me.|$|E
