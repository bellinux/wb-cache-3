5|$|For the sub-plot {{about the}} morning-after pill, former Clinton {{economic}} advisor Gene Sperling {{was brought in}} for consultation. Such a drug, called <b>Mifepristone,</b> was in fact approved in the United States in September 2000; {{one of the last}} months of the Clinton presidency. Also the political issues related to Haiti have close parallels to an episode in the Clinton presidency: the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power by the United States in 1994.|$|E
5|$|In this episode, Veronica aids a {{conservative}} Christian student named Bonnie Capistrano (Carlee Avers) {{in finding out}} who slipped her <b>mifepristone,</b> which caused a miscarriage. Meanwhile, Veronica becomes obsessed with Madison Sinclair (Amanda Noret) after becoming enraged that Madison and Logan (Jason Dohring) had sex while they were broken up. In addition, Veronica and Keith (Enrico Colantoni) discover new information about Dean O'Dell's death.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, Richard Richter {{developed}} the first intrauterine device made from silkworm gut, which was further developed and marketed in Germany by Ernst Gräfenberg {{in the late}} 1920s. In 1951, a chemist, named Carl Djerassi from Mexico City made the hormones in progesterone pills using Mexican yams. Djerassi had chemically created the pill but was not equipped to distribute them to patients. Meanwhile, Gregory Pincus and John Rock {{with help from the}} Planned Parenthood Federation of America {{developed the}} first birth control pills in the 1950s, such as mestranol/noretynodrel, which became publicly available in the 1960s through the Food and Drug Administration under the name Enovid. Medical abortion became an alternative to surgical abortion with the availability of prostaglandin analogs in the 1970s and <b>mifepristone</b> in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{trials of}} <b>mifepristone</b> in China began in 1985. In October 1988, China {{became the first}} {{country in the world}} to approve <b>mifepristone.</b> Chinese {{organizations}} tried to purchase <b>mifepristone</b> from Roussel Uclaf, which refused to sell it to them, so in 1992 China began its own domestic production of <b>mifepristone.</b> In 2000, the cost of medical abortion with <b>mifepristone</b> was higher than surgical abortion and the percentage of medical abortions varied greatly, ranging from 30% to 70% in cities to being almost nonexistent in rural areas.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, <b>mifepristone</b> was {{approved}} in Taiwan. Vietnam included <b>mifepristone</b> in the National Reproductive Health program in 2002.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{abortion}} used to {{be available}} in Canada but on a limited basis using methotrexate and misoprostol. Clinical trials were done in 2000 in various Canadian cities comparing methotrexate to <b>mifepristone,</b> after approbation by the federal government. While both drugs had overall similar results, <b>mifepristone</b> was found to act faster. Health Canada gave approval to <b>mifepristone</b> in July 2015.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mifepristone</b> alone {{results in}} {{abortion}} within 1–2 weeks in 8% to 46% of pregnancies. There {{is no evidence}} that the effects of <b>mifepristone</b> can be reversed.|$|E
25|$|The antiprogestin <b>mifepristone</b> (also {{known as}} RU-486) is {{available}} in five countries as a low-dose or mid-dose emergency contraceptive tablet, effective up to 120 hours after intercourse. Low-dose <b>mifepristone</b> ECPs are available by prescription in Armenia, Russia, Ukraine, and Vietnam and from a pharmacist without a prescription in China. Mid-dose <b>mifepristone</b> ECPs are available by prescription in China and Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|Low dose <b>mifepristone</b> tablets for {{emergency}} contraception are available by prescription in Armenia (Gynepriston), Russia (Agesta, Gynepriston, <b>Mifepristone</b> 72, Negele), Ukraine (Gynepriston), and Vietnam (Mifestad 10, Ciel EC).|$|E
25|$|In 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration {{approved}} <b>mifepristone,</b> to end {{a pregnancy}} through 70 days gestation (70 days or less since {{the first day of}} a woman’s last menstrual period). The approved dosing regimen is 200 mg of <b>mifepristone</b> taken by mouth (swallowed). 24 to 48 hours after taking <b>mifepristone,</b> 800 mcg (micrograms) of misoprostol is taken buccally (in the cheek pouch), at a location appropriate for the patient.|$|E
25|$|Exposure to {{a single}} large dose of <b>mifepristone</b> in newborn rats was not {{associated}} with any reproductive problems, although chronic low-dose exposure of newborn rats to <b>mifepristone</b> was associated with structural and functional reproductive abnormalities.|$|E
25|$|In the {{presence}} of progesterone, <b>mifepristone</b> acts as a competitive progesterone receptor antagonist (in the absence of progesterone, <b>mifepristone</b> acts as a partial agonist). <b>Mifepristone</b> is a 19-nor steroid with a bulky p-(dimethylamino)phenyl substituent above {{the plane of the}} molecule at the 11β-position responsible for inducing or stabilizing an inactive receptor conformation and a hydrophobic 1-propynyl substituent below the plane of the molecule at the 17α-position that increases its progesterone receptor binding affinity.|$|E
25|$|For 10mg of <b>mifepristone</b> {{taken up}} to 120 hours (5 days) after intercourse, the {{combined}} estimate from three trials was an effectiveness of 83%. A review {{found that a}} moderate dose of <b>mifepristone</b> is better than LNG or Yuzpe.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mifepristone</b> is {{used for}} {{emergency}} contraception.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mifepristone</b> as {{a regular}} {{contraceptive}} at 2mg daily prevents ovulation (1mg daily does not). A single preovulatory 10-mg dose of <b>mifepristone</b> delays ovulation by three to four days and is as effective an emergency contraceptive as a single 1.5-mg dose of the progestin levonorgestrel.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mifepristone</b> {{showed no}} {{detectable}} anti-HIV activity in clinical trials.|$|E
25|$|Many pro-life {{groups in}} the United States {{actively}} campaigned against the approval of <b>mifepristone</b> and continue to actively campaign for its withdrawal. They cite either ethical issues with abortion or safety concerns regarding the drug and the adverse reactions associated with it. Religious and pro-life groups outside the United States have also protested <b>mifepristone,</b> especially in Germany and Australia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mifepristone</b> is a {{synthetic}} 19-norsteroid with substitutions at positions C11 and C17 (17β-hydroxy-11β-(4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)-17α-(1-propynyl)estra-4,9-dien-3-one).|$|E
25|$|Dexamethasone {{and other}} {{corticosteroids}} are agonists, and <b>mifepristone</b> and ketoconazole are antagonists of the GR.|$|E
25|$|In women, <b>mifepristone</b> at doses {{greater or}} equal to 1mg/kg antagonizes the endometrial and myometrial effects of progesterone. In humans, an antiglucocorticoid effect of <b>mifepristone</b> is {{manifested}} at doses greater {{or equal to}} 4.5mg/kg by a compensatory increase in ACTH and cortisol. In animals, a weak antiandrogenic effect is seen with prolonged administration of very high doses of 10 to 100mg/kg.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mifepristone</b> alone {{results in}} {{abortion}} within 1–2 weeks in 8% to 46% of pregnancies.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mifepristone</b> {{followed}} by a prostaglandin analog (misoprostol or gemeprost) is used for medical abortion.|$|E
25|$|There {{is little}} {{difference}} in terms of safety and efficacy between medical abortion using a combined regimen of <b>mifepristone</b> and misoprostol and surgical abortion (vacuum aspiration) in early first trimester abortions up to 9 weeks gestation. Medical abortion using the prostaglandin analog misoprostol alone is less effective and more painful than medical abortion using a combined regimen of <b>mifepristone</b> and misoprostol or surgical abortion.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mifepristone</b> {{was banned}} in Australia in 1996. In late 2005, a private member's bill was {{introduced}} to the Australian Senate to lift the ban and transfer the power of approval to the Therapeutic Goods Administration. The move caused much debate in the Australian media and amongst politicians. The bill passed the Senate on 10 February 2006, and <b>mifepristone</b> is now legal in Australia. It is provided regularly at several specialized abortion clinics per state. <b>Mifepristone</b> 200mg tablets have marketing authorizations in Australia from the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TPA) for early first trimester medical abortion when followed by the prostaglandin analog misoprostol through 63 days gestational age and second trimester medical abortion when followed by a prostaglandin analog.|$|E
25|$|Ulipristal acetate, and mid-dose <b>mifepristone</b> is more {{effective}} than levonorgestrel, which is {{more effective}} than the Yupse method.|$|E
25|$|In those {{patients}} not suited for {{or unwilling to}} undergo surgery, several drugs {{have been found to}} inhibit cortisol synthesis (e.g. ketoconazole, metyrapone) but they are of limited efficacy. <b>Mifepristone</b> is a powerful glucocorticoid type II receptor antagonist and, since it does not interfere with normal cortisol homeostatis type I receptor transmission, may be especially useful for treating the cognitive effects of Cushing's syndrome. However, the medication faces considerable controversy due to its use as an abortifacient. In February 2012, the FDA approved <b>mifepristone</b> to control high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) in adult patients who are not candidates for surgery, or who did not respond to prior surgery, with the warning that <b>mifepristone</b> should never be used by pregnant women.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{abortion}} {{became an}} alternative to surgical abortion with the availability of prostaglandin analogs in the 1970s {{and the availability of}} <b>mifepristone</b> in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mifepristone</b> showed initial {{promise in}} {{psychotic}} major depression, a difficult-to-treat form of depression, but a phase-III clinical trial was terminated early {{due to lack}} of efficacy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mifepristone</b> was {{registered}} {{for use in}} Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Uzbekistan in 2002, in Guyana and Moldova in 2004, in Mongolia in 2005, and in Armenia in 2007.|$|E
25|$|Mifegyne was {{subsequently}} approved in Great Britain on July 1, 1991, and in Sweden in September 1992, but {{until his retirement}} in late April 1994, Hoechst AG chairman Wolfgang Hilger, a devout Roman Catholic, blocked any further expansion in availability. On May 16, 1994, Roussel-Uclaf announced it was donating without remuneration all rights for medical uses of <b>mifepristone</b> in the United States to the Population Council, which subsequently licensed <b>mifepristone</b> to Danco Laboratories, a new single-product company immune to antiabortion boycotts, which won FDA approval as Mifeprex on September 28, 2000.|$|E
25|$|A 2011 {{evidence-based}} clinical guideline by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) says medical abortion using <b>mifepristone</b> {{followed by}} the prostaglandin analog misoprostol is effective and appropriate at any gestational age.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} early first-trimester medical {{abortion}} regimens use <b>mifepristone</b> {{in combination with}} a prostaglandin analog (misoprostol or gemeprost) up to 9 weeks gestational age, methotrexate in combination with a prostaglandin analog up to 7 weeks gestation, or a prostaglandin analog alone. Mifepristone–misoprostol combination regimens work faster and are more effective at later gestational ages than methotrexate–misoprostol combination regimens, and combination regimens are more effective than misoprostol alone. This regime is effective in the second trimester. Medical abortion regiments involving <b>mifepristone</b> followed by misoprostol in the cheek between 24 and 48 hours later are effective when performed before 63 days' gestation.|$|E
25|$|A 2012 {{technical}} and policy guidance {{book and a}} 2014 clinical practice handbook by the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend <b>mifepristone</b> followed by the prostaglandin analog misoprostol for first and second trimester medical abortions.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, {{researchers}} at Roussel Uclaf in France developed <b>mifepristone,</b> a chemical compound which {{works as an}} abortifacient by blocking hormone action. It was first marketed in France under the trade name Mifegyne in 1988.|$|E
25|$|Low dose <b>mifepristone</b> tablets (Bi Yun, Fu Nai Er, Hou Ding Nuo, Hua Dian, Si Mi An) for {{emergency}} contraception are available {{directly from a}} pharmacist without a prescription and with a prescription in China.|$|E
25|$|No {{long-term}} {{studies to}} evaluate the carcinogenic potential of <b>mifepristone</b> have been performed. This is in accord with ICH guidelines, which do not require carcinogencity testing in nongenotoxic drugs intended for administration for less than six months.|$|E
