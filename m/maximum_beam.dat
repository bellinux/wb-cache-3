25|$|During the 17th century, the British {{developed}} the dogger, an early type of sailing trawler or longliner, which commonly operated in the North Sea. Doggers were slow but sturdy, capable of {{fishing in the}} rough conditions of the North Sea. Like the herring buss, they were wide-beamed and bluff-bowed, but considerably smaller, about 15 metres long, a <b>maximum</b> <b>beam</b> of 4.5 metres, a draught of 1.5 metres, and displacing about 13 tonnes. They could carry a tonne of bait, three tonnes of salt, half a tonne each of food and firewood for the crew, and return with six tonnes of fish. Decked areas forward and aft probably provided accommodation, storage and a cooking area. An anchor would have allowed extended periods fishing in the same spot, in waters up to 18 metres deep. The dogger would also have carried a small open boat for maintaining lines and rowing ashore.|$|E

50|$|During {{her second}} rebuild, {{which took place}} during the winter of 1828, Constellation was {{dismantled}} throughout her midsections and her stern section down to the floor. An increase of 17 inches was made to the hull’s maximum molded breath, and added to the 14 inches increase in Constellation hull’s <b>maximum</b> molded <b>beam</b> made in 1813, altered the hull’s maximum molded breadth of beam from 40 feet in 1797 to 42 ft. 7ins., which was the maximum molded breadth upon her departure from Gosport in 1829. Also installed was the newly developed round transom, an elliptic stern and rudder assembly and a new captain’s cabin.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} optical crosstalk on our recently proposed indoor gigabit optical wireless (OW) communication system incorporating wavelength division multiplexing (WDM). A theoretical model that allows this impact to be assessed has been proposed. The analytical results are validated via experiments. We show that the power penalty due to crosstalk in our proposed indoor WDM OW system is lower compared {{to that in the}} conventional optical fiber communication systems. In addition, it is found that the power penalty due to crosstalk is lower for the higher speed system since the receiver preamplifier-induced noise dominates the noise process. Finally, the <b>maximum</b> error-free <b>beam</b> footprint for different levels of optical crosstalk has been investigated. The results show that, for the 10 - and 12. 5 -Gb/s systems, the <b>maximum</b> error-free <b>beam</b> footprint is only reduced by ∼ 5 cm, even with comparatively strong crosstalk...|$|R
50|$|Conventionally, {{the energy}} of {{diagnostic}} and therapeutic gamma- and X-rays is expressed in kilovolts or megavolts (kV or MV), whilst {{the energy of}} therapeutic electrons is {{expressed in terms of}} megaelectronvolts (MeV). In the first case, this voltage is the maximum electric potential used by a linear accelerator to produce the photon beam. The beam is made up of a spectrum of energies: the maximum energy is approximately equal to the <b>beam's</b> <b>maximum</b> electric potential times the electron charge. Thus a 1 MV beam will produce photons of no more than about 1 MeV. The mean X-ray energy is only about 1/3 of the <b>maximum</b> energy. <b>Beam</b> quality and hardness may be improved by X-ray filters, which improve the homogeneity of the X-ray spectrum.|$|R

40|$|The memo {{describes}} the <b>maximum</b> credible <b>beam</b> the LCLS injector can produce and lose at various locations along the beamline.

The source of the <b>maximum</b> credible <b>beam</b> results from the explosive electron emission from the photocathode if the drive laser intensity exceeds the threshold for plasma production. In this event, the gun's RF field can extract a large number of electrons from this plasma which are accelerated out of the gun and into the beamline. This electron emission persists until it has depleted the gun of all its energy. Hence the number of electrons emitted per pulse is limited by the amount of stored RF energy in the gun. It needs to be emphasized that this type of emission is highly undesirable, as it causes permanent damage to the cathode...|$|R
