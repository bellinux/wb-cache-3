[...] That prediction proved to be correct at Gettysburg. Stephen Sears wrote, [...] "The {{fact of the matter is}} that George G. Meade, unexpectedly and against all odds, thoroughly outgeneraled Robert E. Lee at Gettysburg." [...] Edwin B. Coddington wrote that the soldiers of the Army of the Potomac received a [...] "sense of triumph which grew into an imperishable faith in [...] The men knew what they could do under an extremely competent general; one of lesser ability and courage could well have lost the battle." ...|$|E
500|$|Bryan's announcement, after {{gaining the}} Democratic nomination, {{that he would}} {{undertake}} a nationwide tour by rail, something then unusual for presidential candidates, put pressure on McKinley to match him. Hanna especially urged his candidate to hit the road. McKinley decided against this, feeling {{that he could not}} outdo Bryan, who was a brilliant stump speaker, and that he would be foolish to try. [...] "I might as well put up a trapeze on <b>my</b> <b>front</b> lawn and compete against some professional athlete as go out speaking against Bryan. I have to think when I speak." [...] Furthermore, no matter how McKinley traveled, Bryan would upstage him by choosing a less comfortable manner. McKinley was unwilling to compete with Bryan on the Democrat's terms, and sought to find his own way to reach the people.|$|E

I have to think when I speak." [...] Instead of going to the people, McKinley would remain at home in Canton and allow the people to come to him; according to historian R. Hal Williams in his book on the 1896 election, [...] "it was, as it turned out, a brilliant strategy. McKinley's 'Front Porch Campaign' became a legend in American political history." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} 1974, {{with sales}} of D skyrocketing, the future looked bright for Gygax and Kaye, who were only 36 years old. But in January 1975, Kaye {{unexpectedly}} {{died of a heart}} attack. He had not made any specific provision in his will regarding his one-third share of the company, simply leaving his entire estate to his wife Donna. Although she had worked briefly for TSR as an accountant, she had not shared her husband's enthusiasm for gaming, and made it clear that she would not be having anything to do with managing the company. Gygax characterized her as [...] "less than personable... After Don died she dumped all the Tactical Studies Rules materials off on <b>my</b> <b>front</b> porch. It would have been impossible to manage a business with her involved as a partner." [...] After Kaye's death, TSR was forced to relocate from Kaye's dining room to Gygax's basement. In July 1975, Gygax and Blume reorganized their company from a partnership to a corporation called TSR Hobbies. Gygax owned 150 shares, Blume owned the other 100 shares, and both had the option to buy up to 700 shares {{at any time in the}} future. But TSR Hobbies had nothing to publish—D was still owned by the 3-way partnership of TSR, and neither Gygax nor Blume had the money to buy out the shares owned by Kaye's wife. Blume persuaded a reluctant Gygax to allow his father, Melvin Blume, to buy Donna's shares, and those were converted to 200 shares in TSR Hobbies. In addition, Brian bought another 140 shares. These purchases reduced Gygax from the majority shareholder in control of the company to minority shareholder; he effectively became the Blumes' employee.|$|E
2500|$|Yardbirds' rhythm guitarist, Chris Dreja, {{recalled}} that whenever Clapton broke a guitar string during a concert, {{he would stay}} on stage and replace it. The English audiences would wait out the delay by doing {{what is called a}} [...] "slow handclap". Clapton's nickname of 'Slowhand' came from Giorgio Gomelsky, a pun on the slow handclapping that ensued when Clapton stopped playing while he replaced a string. In December 1964, Clapton made his first appearance at the Royal Albert Hall, London, with the Yardbirds. Since then, Clapton has performed at the Hall over 200 times, and has stated that performing at the venue is like [...] "playing in <b>my</b> <b>front</b> room".|$|E

2500|$|... "I'll Follow the Sun" [...] was a {{reworking}} {{of an old}} song. McCartney {{recalled in}} a 1988 interview: [...] "I wrote that in <b>my</b> <b>front</b> parlour in Forthlin Road. I was about 16... We had this R image in Liverpool, a rock and roll/R/hardish image with the leather. So I think songs like 'I'll Follow the Sun', ballads like that, got pushed back to later." [...] Author Mark Hertsgaard cites its inclusion {{as a reflection of}} the paucity of original material available to the band, since McCartney acknowledged that the song [...] "wouldn't have been considered good enough" [...] for their previous releases. Martin nevertheless later named it as his favourite song on Beatles for Sale.|$|E

2500|$|In 1965, after {{extensive}} testing, Borlaug's team, under Anderson, {{began its}} effort by importing about 450tons of Lerma Rojo and Sonora 64 semi-dwarf seed varieties: 250tons went to Pakistan and 200 to India. They encountered many obstacles. Their first shipment of wheat {{was held up}} in Mexican customs and so {{it could not be}} shipped from the port at Guaymas in time for proper planting. Instead, it was sent via a 30-truck convoy from Mexico to the U.S. port in Los Angeles, encountering delays at the Mexico - United States border. Once the convoy entered the U.S., it had to take a detour, as the U.S. National Guard had closed the freeway due to Watts riots in Los Angeles. When the seeds reached Los Angeles, a Mexican bank refused to honor Pakistan treasury's payment of US$100,000, because the check contained three misspelled words. Still, the seed was loaded onto a freighter destined for Bombay, India, and Karachi, Pakistan. Twelve hours into the freighter's voyage, war broke out between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir region. Borlaug received a telegram from the Pakistani minister of agriculture, Malik Khuda Bakhsh Bucha: [...] "I'm sorry to hear you are having trouble with my check, but I've got troubles, too. Bombs are falling on <b>my</b> <b>front</b> lawn. Be patient, the money is in the bank..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Having {{the home}} {{recording}} system also proved useful for production, the band {{felt that it}} would not only benefit themselves, but other local bands who could not afford the studio prices, even in the Welwyn Garden City area. It was here that Billy and Charlotte both stumbled upon the opportunity that would eventually prove significant for the band. [...] "I was producing a local Welwyn Garden City band in <b>my</b> <b>front</b> lounge one day and I noticed that it was quite good so I asked {{if they were going to}} send it to any London venues, because I knew a few that would like it. They said that they were going to send it off to Michael Eavis who runs Glastonbury Festival, and I asked why..." [...] Michael Eavis that year was running an unsigned bands competition to play on the Other Stage, and The Subways decided that would be a great idea. [...] "It was really just another address to send one of our CDs off to. All we wanted was to play shows and this was another great opportunity. The CD we sent off to Michael Eavis was literally one among a bunch of 30 that were being sent out to London promoters for a load of gigs we wanted to book. We never expected the phone call saying that we'd won and were to play Glastonbury", said Cooper on radio. The Subways remain friends with Eavis today, and have suggested that other upcoming bands should send demos to Eavis.|$|E
