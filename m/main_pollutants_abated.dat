40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{evaluate}} the emissions of the <b>main</b> <b>pollutants</b> of a pellet stove, by trying to simulate the real use in domestic operations. All the operating phases of this system were considered: ignition, partial load, increase in power, and nominal load. In each phase, quantity and type of some pollutants in emissions were determined: the <b>main</b> <b>pollutant</b> gases (CO, NOx, SO 2, H 2 S and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)), total dust (PM) and its content of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), regulated heavy metals (Ni, Cd, As and Pb), main soluble ions and Total Carbon (TC). Results show that emission factors of TSP, CO, and of the <b>main</b> determined <b>pollutants</b> (TC, Cd and PAHs) are higher during ignition phase. In particular, this phase prevalently contributes to PAHs emissions. During increase in power phase, gas and particulate emissions do not appreciably differ from nominal load ones; nevertheless, PAH emission factors are higher than steady state ones, but lower than ignition phase. Moreover, during not-steady state phases, PAH mixture is more toxic than during steady state phases. In conclusion, this study allowed to go deeper in pellet stove environmental impact, by pointing out how the different operating conditions can modify the emissions. These are different from certificated data, which are based exclusively on measurements in steady state conditions...|$|R

In this way, contrary to the prevailing decentralized methodology {{of environmental protection}} and negation of the pollution aftereffects, it is recommended to form a unified database of <b>main</b> <b>pollutants</b> for the whole region. This database enables impact detection of specific factors (industrial facilities, waste dumps and other pollutants) on a scale which transcends to neighboring municipalities, regions, or the overall country. The state of the environment and waste management in the South Morava region is directly impacted by an array of environmentally degradable factors, with economics being the most prominent one (industrial facilities, which represented the <b>main</b> <b>pollutants</b> in the past, applied little, if any, regard to the environmental protection, dumping their waste on improvised, unprotected waste dumps). On the other hand, low level of employment, rudimentary industrial technology made positive environmental effect in the past 5 to 10 years, because of lack of direct pollution.
