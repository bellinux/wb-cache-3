Faecal samples were subjected to direct smear, floatation, quantitative estimation of helminth eggs (epg) and oocysts (opg), larval isolation and identification by modified Baermans technique and oocyst sporulation for specie identification. Out of the 108 primates examined, 75 (69. 44 %) were found to be shedding the ova and oocysts of several gastrointestinal parasites of which, the mona monkeys (Cercopethicus mona) 16 (80 %) followed by the white collared mangabey (Cercocebus torquatus) 7 (77. 78) had the highest (p Pan troglodytes) had the highest ova or oocyst counts and variety of gastrointestinal parasites such as Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, Balantidium coli, Enterobius vermicularis, Entamoeba histolytica, Strongyloides stercoralis, Blastocystis hominis, Hymenolepis nana, Schistosoma mansoni, Ancylostosoma duodenale and Cryptosporidium species.

40|$|Recent {{serological}} {{and molecular}} surveys of different primate species allowed {{the characterization of}} several Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) homologues in macaques, African green monkeys, chimpanzees, and gorillas. Identification of these new primate rhadinoviruses revealed the existence of two distinct genogroups, called RV 1 and RV 2. Using a degenerate consensus primer PCR method for the herpesvirus DNA polymerase gene, the presence of KSHV homologues has been investigated in two semi-free-ranging colonies of eight drill (<b>Mandrillus</b> <b>leucophaeus),</b> five mandrill (<b>Mandrillus</b> sphinx), and two hybrid (Mandrillus leucophaeus-Mandrillus sphinx) monkeys, living in Cameroon and Gabon, Central Africa. This search revealed the existence of not only two distinct KSHV homologues, each one belonging {{to one of the}} two rhadinovirus genogroups, but also of two new betaherpesvirus sequences, one being close to cytomegaloviruses and the other being related to human herpesviruses 6 and 7 (HHV- 6 and - 7). The latter viruses are the first simian HHV- 6 and - 7 homologues identified to date. These data show that mandrill and drill monkeys are the hosts of at least four novel distinct herpesviruses. Moreover, mandrills, like macaques and African green monkeys, harbor also two distinct gamma- 2 herpesviruses, thus strongly suggesting that a second gamma- 2 herpesvirus, belonging to the RV 2 genogroup, may exist in humans...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} how the mitochondrial membrane potential affects sperm motility using laser tweezers and a non-ratiometric fluorescent probe, DiOC 6 (3). A 1064 nm Nd:YVO 4 continuous wave laser was used to trap motile sperm at a power of 450 mW in the trap spot. Using customized tracking software, the curvilinear velocity (VCL) and the escape force from the laser tweezers weremeasured. Human (Homo sapiens), dog (Canis lupis familiaris) and drill (<b>Mandrillus</b> <b>leucophaeus)</b> sperm were treated with DiOC 6 (3) to measure the membrane potential in the mitochondria-rich sperm midpieces. Sperm from all three species exhibited an increase in fluorescence when treated with the DiOC 6 (3). When a cyanide inhibitor (CCCP) of aerobic respiration was applied, sperm of all three species exhibited a reduction in fluorescence to pre-dye levels. With respect to VCL and escape force, the CCCP had no effect on dog or human sperm, suggesting a major reliance upon anaerobic respiration (glycolysis) for ATP in these two species. Based on the preliminary study on drill sperm, CCCP caused a drop in the VCL, suggesting potential reliance on both glycolysis and aerobic respiration for motility. The results demonstrate that optical trapping in combination with DiOC 6 (3) is an effective way to study sperm motility and energetics. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The drill (<b>Mandrillus</b> <b>leucophaeus),</b> a forest-living Old World monkey, {{is highly}} sexually dimorphic, with males exhibiting extreme {{secondary}} sexual characteristics, including growth of paranasal swellings on the muzzle. In this study, {{the size of}} the secondary bone that forms the paranasal swellings on the muzzles of drills was assessed in relation to body mass proxies. The relationship between the overall size of the muzzle and surrogate measures of body mass was also examined. In female drills, muzzle breadth was positively correlated with two proxies of overall body mass, greatest skull length and upper M 1 area. However, there was no such correlation in males. Paranasal swellings in males also appeared to have no significant relationship to body mass proxies. This suggests that secondary bone growth on the muzzles of male drills is independent of overall body size. Furthermore, this secondary bone appears to be vermiculate, probably developing rapidly and in an irregular manner, with no correlation in the sizes of paranasal swelling height and breadth. However, various paranasal swelling dimensions were related to {{the size of the}} muzzle. It is suggested that the growth of the paranasal swellings and possibly the muzzle could be influenced by androgen production and reflect testes size and sperm motility. The size and appearance of the paranasal swellings may thus be an indicator of reproductive quality both to potential mates and male competitors. Further work is required to investigate the importance of the paranasal swellings as secondary sexual characteristics in Mandrillus and the relationship between body size and secondary sexual characteristics. Attention should also be paid to the mechanisms and trajectories of facial growth in Mandrillus...|$|R
40|$|Mandrillus sphinx, a large primate {{living in}} Cameroon and Gabon and {{belonging}} to the Papionini tribe, {{was reported to be}} infected by a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) (SIVmndGB 1) as early as 1988. Here, we have identified a second, highly divergent SIVmnd (designated SIVmnd- 2). Genomic organization differs between the two viral types; SIVmnd- 2 has the additional vpx gene, like other SIVs naturally infecting the Papionini tribe (SIVsm and SIVrcm) and in contrast to the other SIVmnd type (here designated SIVmnd- 1), which is more closely related to SIVs infecting l'hoest (Cercopithecus lhoesti lhoesti) and sun-tailed (Cercopithecus lhoesti solatus) monkeys. Importantly, our epidemiological studies indicate a high prevalence of both types of SIVmnd; all 10 sexually mature wild-living monkeys and 3 out of 17 wild-born juveniles tested were infected. The geographic distribution of SIVmnd seems to be distinct for the two types: SIVmnd- 1 viruses were exclusively identified in mandrills from central and southern Gabon, whereas SIVmnd- 2 viruses were identified in monkeys from northern and western Gabon, as well as in Cameroon. SIVmnd- 2 full-length sequence analysis, together with analysis of partial sequences from SIVmnd- 1 and SIVmnd- 2 from wild-born or wild-living mandrills, shows that the gag and pol regions of SIVmnd- 2 are closest to those of SIVrcm, isolated from red-capped mangabeys (Cercocebus torquatus), while the env gene is closest to that of SIVmnd- 1. pol and env sequence analyses of SIV from a related Papionini species, the drill (<b>Mandrillus</b> <b>leucophaeus),</b> shows a closer relationship of SIVdrl to SIVmnd- 2 than to SIVmnd- 1. Epidemiological surveys of human immunodeficiency virus revealed a case in Cameroon of a human infected by a virus serologically related to SIVmnd, raising the possibility that mandrills represent a viral reservoir for humans similar to sooty mangabeys in Western Africa and chimpanzees in Central Africa...|$|R

40|$|Drills (<b>Mandrillus</b> <b>leucophaeus)</b> are an {{endangered}} species of African monkey (Cercopithecidae), and their sole congener the mandrill (Mandrillus sphinx) is vulnerable to extinction. Both species are threatened in the wild by deforestation and hunting. Drills have a poor record of captive reproduction. Many individuals appear to have behavioral deficiencies which interfere with reproduction. Thus, the zoo population of drills does not serve as a “hedge” against the species’ total extinction: drills are endangered in captivity {{as well as in}} the wild. Mandrills, by contrast, reproduce well in captivity. Information on the behavior of mandrills in captivity may help zoo managers improve husbandry for both species. The intent of this research was to study the relationship between aspects of the captive environment and behaviors which lead to reproduction. A review of the literature on both drills and mandrills, in the wild and captivity, was used to suggest “essential characteristics” of the captive environment that may encourage animals of both species to engage in natural, active behaviors, to form cohesive dyads with opposite-sex adults, to develop affiliative bonds, and to engage in sexual behavior. Sixty-two drills and mandrills in 14 groups in the U. S. and Germany were studied with behavior sampling methods, using the Drill Species Survival Plan ethogram. Data were analyzed by multiple regression using transformed variables. No over-all species differences in behavior were found. Results suggested that two factors promoted natural activity: 1) environmental enrichment which provides positive reinforcement for active behaviors, and 2) an affiliative husbandry style by the animal’s keepers. Active animals were more likely to engage in social behaviors leading to copulation. Many of the non-reproducing drills appeared to be “passive and withdrawn,” and shared a constellation of signs that appeared to be analogous to human clinical depression. An etiological model for “passive and withdrawn” Mandrillus, based on biobehavioral theories of human depressive disorders, was developed to link early rearing conditions and environmental enrichment. This model was then used to develop a historic-demographic hypothesis for why mandrills have historically had greater reproductive success than drills in zoos...|$|R
40|$|The {{ubiquity of}} simian immunodeficiencyvirus (SIV) in African nonhuman primatesand the {{discovery}} of ancient endogenous lentiviruses (1) suggest that SIV is very old. Con-versely, molecular clock methods calibrated by using modern sequences indicate a time scale of just centuries (2, 3). To resolve this conundrum, we sampled monkeys on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea, which was isolated from Africa as sea levels rose 10, 000 to 12, 000 years before the pres-ent (yr B. P.) (fig. S 1) (4). Bushmeat specimens were screened by SIV serological tests and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequencing of conserved viral pol gene frag-ments [472 to 633 base pairs (bp) ], followed by phylogenetic analyses. Of 79 individuals from six species, we de-tected 22 sequence-confirmed SIV positives in four species, with a prevalence of 22 to 33 % (table S 1). Phylogenetic analyses (Fig. 1 and figs. S 2 and S 3) revealed previously uncharacterized species-specific SIV lineages in Cercopithecus erythrotis erythrotis (SIVreg-Bioko),Colobus satanas satanas (SIVblc-Bioko), andCercopithecus preussi insularis (SIVprg-Bioko). The fourth, the Bioko drill, <b>Mandrillus</b> <b>leucophaeus</b> poensis, is infected with SIVdrl-Bioko and has a mainland conspecific counterpart,Mandrillus leucophaeus leucophaeus, infectedwith SIVdrl (fig. S 1). These viruses form a monophyletic group with SIVmnd- 2 from the mandrill, the closest relative of the drill (Fig. 1). Each Bioko SIV lineage shares ancestry with a mainland virus found in a monkey of the same genus (Fig. 1). Barring the possibility that hu-mans introduced multiple species-specific SIV lineages to the wild monkey populations of Bioko, the mainland and island SIVdrl variants must have been evolving independently since Biokobecame isolated~ 10, 000 yrB. P., and perhaps longer given {{the high levels of}} genetic diversity seen within local SIV populations. We used the SIVdrl/SIVdrl-Bioko ancestor dated ~ 10, 000 yr B.

5000|$|All diurnal African monkeys {{weigh in}} excess of 2 kg in adulthood. Cercopithecine monkeys are on the small side. Full-grown female Cercopithecus can range in average weight from 2.7 to 4.26 kg and males from 4.1 to 6.9 kg {{depending}} on species. All mangabeys and most colobus monkeys weigh considerably {{in excess of}} 5 kg at maturity. Any monkey of a weight of up to 10 to 15 kg may reportedly be hunted. As a comparison, the heaviest primate known to be successfully killed by harpy eagles was a 6.5 kg Bolivian red howler (Alouatta sara). The crowned eagle's diet may extend to the young or even (rarely) adult females of baboons and similar species, such as adult female yellow baboons, olive baboons (Papio anubis), chacma baboons (P. ursinus), drills (<b>Mandrillus</b> <b>leucophaeus)</b> and mandrills (M. sphinx), all falling into the above maximum primate weight bracket and all have been successfully hunted. In some cases baboons and drills may be actively avoided, as the adult males of these species, at up to twice as heavy as the female, are probably invulnerable to hunting and tend to be notoriously violent-tempered. In one case, olive baboons destroyed the nest of a crowned eagle pair {{after one of the}} eagles killed a baby in the baboon group. When experimentally exposed to an image of a crowned eagle, a dominant male mandrill reacted aggressively towards it, implying that they will keep eagles at bay to protect the more vulnerable members of their troop. The crowned eagle is considered a potential predator of infant chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (P. paniscus), although this is unconfirmed. Although rarely observed, some monkeys will [...] "bait" [...] crowned eagles, that is harass and provoke them. Leslie Brown described Sykes' monkeys (Cercopithecus albogularis) as rarely baiting eagles [...] "with the insolent impunity of an expert tolero with a bull". Struhsaker and Leakey found that adult male monkeys were often better represented in the diet than adult females. This may be a result of the behavior of male primates. In some species, only adult males often travel separately from social groups, only adult males take aggressive action against eagles, and only adult males have loud calls that may attract the attention of eagles. The variation in behavior of primates is illustrated so that in red colobus species, in which adult males patrol in mixed groups, the males are rarely attacked; meanwhile in the black-and-white colobus, in which adult males often patrol alone, male are regularly attacked and killed by crowned eagles. However, adult monkeys (52%) were found in almost equal measure as juvenile monkeys (at 48%) in Uganda. African primates weighing under 2 kg, are almost entirely arboreal and nocturnal. However, such primates, actually allies of lemurs rather than monkeys, may occasionally also be hunted by crowned eagles. Potto (Perodicticus potto) are notable secondary prey in the Tai Forest and various galagos have been found across the range, such as in the Kiwengwa/Pongwe Forest Reserve where they made up 7.5% of the remains. Although no one has seen the eagles catch these primates, it is thought pottos and galagos are likely to be taken if discovered by an eagle while sleeping in dense foliage during the day.|$|R
