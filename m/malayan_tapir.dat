5|$|In Siberia, {{the main}} prey species are Manchurian wapiti and wild boar (the two species {{comprising}} nearly 80% of the prey selected) followed by sika deer, moose, roe deer, and musk deer. Asiatic black bears and Ussuri brown bears may also {{fall prey to}} tigers, and they constitute up to 40.7% of the diet of Siberian tigers depending on local conditions and the bear populations. In Sumatra, prey include sambar deer, muntjac, wild boar, <b>Malayan</b> <b>tapir</b> and orangutan. In the former Caspian tiger's range, prey included saiga antelope, camels, Caucasian wisent, yak, and wild horses. Like many predators, tigers are opportunistic and may eat much smaller prey, such as monkeys, peafowl and other ground-based birds, hares, porcupines, and fish.|$|E
25|$|A {{third phase}} for Islands opened in Summer 2017. The third phase {{included}} new exhibits for Malayan sun bear, Binturongs, <b>Malayan</b> <b>tapir,</b> {{and a new}} songbird aviary featuring various birds from Indonesia {{as well as the}} Critically Endangered Javan Green Magpie.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Malayan</b> <b>tapir</b> (Tapirus indicus), {{also called}} the Asian tapir, is {{the largest of the}} five species of tapir and the only one native to Asia. The {{scientific}} name refers to the East Indies, the species' natural habitat. In the Malay language, the tapir is commonly referred to as cipan, tenuk or badak tampung.|$|E

50|$|The {{ecoregion}} {{home to many}} endangered species, including tigers, <b>Malayan</b> <b>tapirs</b> (Tapirus indicus), clouded leopards (Neofelis nebulosa), Asian elephants (Elephas maximus), and Sumatran rhinoceroses (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis).|$|R
25|$|The {{animals of}} Southeast Asia are diverse; {{on the islands}} of Borneo and Sumatra, the orangutan, the Asian elephant, the <b>Malayan</b> <b>tapir,</b> the Sumatran {{rhinoceros}} and the Bornean clouded leopard can also be found. Six subspecies of the binturong or bearcat exist in the region, though the one endemic to the island of Palawan is now classed as vulnerable.|$|E
25|$|Adult tapirs {{are large}} enough to have few natural predators, and the thick skin {{on the backs of}} their necks helps to protect them from threats such as jaguars, crocodiles, anacondas, and tigers. The creatures are also able to run fairly quickly, {{considering}} their size and cumbersome appearance, finding shelter in the thick undergrowth of the forest or in water. Hunting for meat and hides has substantially reduced their numbers and, more recently, habitat loss has resulted in the conservation watch-listing of all four species; both the Brazilian tapir and the <b>Malayan</b> <b>tapir</b> are classified as vulnerable, and the Baird's tapir and the mountain tapir are endangered.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Malayan</b> <b>tapir,</b> {{the species}} most {{isolated}} geographically {{from the rest}} of the genus, has a significantly smaller number of chromosomes and has been found to share fewer homologies with the three types of American tapirs. A number of conserved autosomes (13 between karyotypes of Baird's tapir and the Brazilian tapir, and 15 between Baird's and the mountain tapir) have also been found in the American species that are not found in the Asian animal. However, geographic proximity is not an absolute predictor of genetic similarity; for instance, G-banded preparations have revealed Malayan, Baird's and Brazilian tapirs have identical X chromosomes, while mountain tapirs are separated by a heterochromatic addition/deletion.|$|E
5000|$|In the [...] "Asia" [...] (Asien) section, {{visitors}} can see Oriental small-clawed otters, red pandas, <b>Malayan</b> <b>tapirs,</b> amur leopards, siberian tigers, Asian elephants, and other animals.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} many animals, such as <b>Malayan</b> <b>tapirs</b> and {{demoiselle}} cranes, {{in areas that}} are inaccessible to the public, but are still somewhat viewable from parts of the zoo.|$|R
50|$|This {{part of the}} zoo is {{the home}} to animals which are native to the {{tropical}} rainforests of Asia. Animals which are on display here include false gharials, great hornbills, southern pig-tailed macaques, siamang, orangutans, <b>Malayan</b> <b>tapirs,</b> leopards, sun bears, Asian elephants and Bengal tigers.|$|R
25|$|The {{gestation}} {{period of the}} <b>Malayan</b> <b>tapir</b> is about 390–395 days, after which a single offspring, weighing around 15 pounds (6.8kg), is born. Malayan tapirs are {{the largest of the}} five tapir species at birth and grow more quickly than their congeners. Young tapirs of all species have brown hair with white stripes and spots, a pattern that enables them to hide effectively in the dappled light of the forest. This baby coat fades into adult coloration between four and seven months after birth. Weaning occurs between six and eight months of age, at which time the babies are nearly full-grown, and the animals reach sexual maturity around age three. Breeding typically occurs in April, May or June, and females generally produce one calf every two years. Malayan tapirs can live up to 30 years, both in the wild and in captivity.|$|E
25|$|Size varies between types, {{but most}} tapirs are about 2m (6.6ft) long, stand about 1m (3ft) high at the shoulder, and weigh between 150 and 300kg (330 and 700lb). Their coats are short and range in color from reddish brown, to grey, to nearly black, with the notable {{exceptions}} of the <b>Malayan</b> <b>tapir,</b> {{which has a}} white, saddle-shaped marking on its back, and the mountain tapir, which has longer, woolly fur. All tapirs have oval, white-tipped ears, rounded, protruding rumps with stubby tails, and splayed, hooved toes, with four toes on the front feet and three on the hind feet, which help them to walk on muddy and soft ground. Baby tapirs of all types have striped-and-spotted coats for camouflage. Females have {{a single pair of}} mammary glands, and males have long penises relative to their body size.|$|E
25|$|Malayan tapirs {{have very}} poor eyesight, making them rely greatly on their {{excellent}} {{sense of smell}} and hearing to go about in their everyday lives. They have small, beady eyes with brown irises {{on either side of}} their faces. Their eyes are often covered in a blue haze, which is corneal cloudiness thought to be caused by repetitive exposure to light. Corneal cloudiness is when the cornea starts to lose its transparency. The cornea is necessary for the transmitting and focusing of outside light as it enters the eye, and cloudiness can cause vision loss. This causes the <b>Malayan</b> <b>tapir</b> to have very inadequate vision, both on land and in water, where they spend the majority of their time. Also, as these tapirs are most active at night and since they have poor eyesight, it is harder for them to search for food and avoid predators in the dark.|$|E
25|$|<b>Malayan</b> <b>tapirs</b> are {{primarily}} solitary creatures, marking out {{large tracts of}} land as their territory, though these areas usually overlap {{with those of other}} individuals. Tapirs mark out their territories by spraying urine on plants, and they often follow distinct paths, which they have bulldozed through the undergrowth.|$|R
50|$|Other notable {{animals in}} London Zoo's {{collection}} include black vultures, greater flamingos, vicunas, Bactrian camels, spectacled owls, red-ruffed lemurs, African harrier hawks, <b>Malayan</b> <b>tapirs,</b> burrowing owls, white-cheeked gibbons, military macaws, Oriental small-clawed otters, reindeer, giant anteaters, Rüppell's vultures, Bornean bearded pigs, Rodrigues fruit bats and great white pelicans.|$|R

25|$|Prey {{animals in}} India include chital, sambar, muntjac, mouse deer, swamp deer, wild boar, gaur, water buffalo, banteng, cattle, nilgai, goats, Indian hares, Himalayan field rats and langurs. There is one {{record of a}} pack {{bringing}} down an Indian elephant calf in Assam, despite desperate defense of the mother resulting in numerous losses to the pack. In Kashmir, they prey on markhor, and thamin in Myanmar, <b>Malayan</b> <b>tapir,</b> Sumatran serow in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula, and Javan rusa in Java. In the Tien Shan and Tarbagatai Mountains, dholes prey on Siberian ibexes, arkhar, roe deer, maral and wild boar. In the Altai and Sayan Mountains, they prey on musk deer and reindeer. In eastern Siberia, they prey on roe deer, Manchurian wapiti, wild pig, musk deer, and reindeer, while in Primorye they feed on sika deer and goral, too. In Mongolia, they prey on argali and rarely Siberian ibex. Like African wild dogs, but unlike wolves, dholes are not known to attack people. Dholes eat fruit and vegetable matter more readily than other canids. In captivity, they eat various kinds of grasses, herbs and leaves, seemingly for pleasure rather than just when ill. In summertime in the Tien Shan Mountains, dholes eat large quantities of mountain rhubarb. Although opportunistic, dholes have a seeming aversion to hunting cattle and their calves. Livestock predation by dholes {{has been a problem}} in Bhutan since the late 1990s, as domestic animals are often left outside to graze in the forest, sometimes for weeks at a time. Livestock stall-fed at night and grazed near homes are never attacked. Oxen are killed more often than cows, probably because they are given less protection.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Malayan</b> <b>tapir</b> {{was once}} found {{throughout}} the tropical lowland rainforests of Southeast Asia, including Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, and Vietnam. However, its numbers have decreased in recent years, and today, like all tapirs, it {{is in danger of}} extinction.|$|E
2500|$|The {{building}} was originally designed as the zoo's [...] "Elephant House" [...] and has held all three elephant species over its history. The building {{has also been}} home to various rhinoceros species, hippopotamus, domestic bactrian camel, <b>Malayan</b> <b>tapir,</b> and North Sulawesi babirusa. The building also held [...] "Rapunzel", {{one of the few}} Sumatran rhinos held in U.S. zoos, until her death in 2005.|$|E
25|$|Tapirs have brown eyes, {{often with}} a bluish cast to them, which has been {{identified}} as corneal cloudiness, a condition most commonly found in <b>Malayan</b> <b>tapirs.</b> The exact etiology is unknown, but the cloudiness may be caused by excessive exposure to light or by trauma. However, the tapir's sensitive ears and strong sense of smell help to compensate for deficiencies in vision.|$|R
50|$|On 1 January 1983, {{the animal}} park was {{classified}} as a monument. Ten years later, its 150th anniversary was celebrated. In 1997, Vriesland (Freezeland) was opened. It houses subantarctic penguins and Alaskan sea otters. In spring 1999, the elephant compound was expanded. In 2003, many animals, including hippos, <b>Malayan</b> <b>tapirs,</b> {{and a number of}} swamp birds received a new home in Hippotopia.|$|R

The <b>Malayan</b> <b>tapir</b> has rather poor eyesight, but excellent hearing and sense of smell.|$|E
2500|$|A tapir ( [...] , [...] , or [...] ) is a large, herbivorous mammal, {{similar in}} shape to a pig, with a short, prehensile nose trunk. Tapirs inhabit jungle and forest regions of South America, Central America, and Southeastern Asia. The five extant species of tapirs are the Brazilian tapir, the <b>Malayan</b> <b>tapir,</b> the Baird's tapir, the kabomani tapir, and the {{mountain}} tapir. The four species that have been evaluated (the Brazilian, Malayan, Baird's and mountain tapir) are all classified as endangered or vulnerable. Their closest relatives are the other odd-toed ungulates, which include horses, donkeys, zebras and rhinoceroses.|$|E
5|$|Other notable mammal {{species in}} the zoo's {{collection}} include oriental small-clawed otters, Asian lions, meerkats, sun bears, Sumatran tigers, giant anteaters, binturong, African wild dogs, Grévy's zebras, greater one-horned rhinoceros, banteng, red river hogs, swamp wallabies, striped skunks, pygmy hippopotamus, Scottish wild cats, <b>Malayan</b> <b>tapirs,</b> white-faced saki monkeys, ring-tailed lemurs, cottontop tamarins, geladas, chinese gorals, red panda, Siberian musk deer, Nile lechwe, grey kangaroo and Barbary macaques.|$|R
50|$|The Indo-Malayan area {{contains}} two pavilions that exhibit {{plants and animals}} from the southern and southeast Asia. There are four outdoor exhibits in this area. Featured animals in this area include Indian rhinos, <b>Malayan</b> <b>tapirs,</b> lion-tailed macaques, Sumatran orangutans, Mandarin ducks, spiny turtles, rare Sumatran tigers, and various freshwater fish. The Malayan Woods Pavilion houses butterflies, whistling ducks, red-tailed green rat snakes, and clouded leopards.|$|R

2500|$|The zoo {{was quite}} popular {{when it opened}} on May 17, 1863. [...] Though the {{population}} of Hamburg was only 300,000, around 54,000 people visited the zoo in its first week of operation. [...] Annual attendance at the zoo in its first ten years of operation was between 225,000 and 355,000 visitors. [...] The zoo's first director Alfred Edmund Brehm invested heavily in building up a large collection, even larger {{than that of the}} Berlin Zoo for much of its history. [...] The zoo had several remarkable breeding successes—it was the first to breed the Brazilian Tapir in 1868, the <b>Malayan</b> <b>Tapir</b> in 1879, and the now-extinct Schomburgk's Deer in 1870. [...] The zoo's aquarium, or the Marine Aquarium Temple, was among the best ever built. [...] In 1865, a German national journal, Die Gartenlaube, declared an [...] "Ocean Fairy Castle" [...] superior to the aquarium of London. [...] The first Sumatran Rhinoceros ever seen in Europe was acquired by the Hamburg Zoological Garden in 1868.|$|E

40|$|The {{retention}} of ingesta in {{the digestive tract}} is a major characteristic of herbivorous animals. We measured particle and fluid mean retention times (MRT) in 13 lowland tapirs (Tapirus terrestris) and 5 <b>Malayan</b> <b>tapirs</b> (Tapirus indicus) from five zoological institutions on their usual zoo diet and 2 lowland and 4 <b>Malayan</b> <b>tapirs</b> additionally on roughage-only diets (total n of trials = 24) with cobalt-EDTA as fluid and chromium-mordanted fibre (< 2 mm) as particle markers. MRT for fluid and particles averaged 42 ± 16 h and 55 ± 18 h in lowland and 40 ± 13 h and 56 ± 14 h in <b>Malayan</b> <b>tapirs.</b> In a General Linerar Model, neither Tapir species, body mass nor diet (characteriszed by the proportion of roughage) {{was significantly related to}} MRT, but dry matter intake was, with a steep decline in MRT with higher intake levels. Compared to other hindgut fermenters, tapirs have a low defecation frequency, which might be linked to their comparatively low food intake. Their gastrointestinal capacity (in dry matter: 1. 63 ± 0. 63 % of body mass) is similar to that calculated for horses. A comparison of the difference in fluid and particle MRT in large hindgut fermenters (horses, rhinoceroses, elephants, and the tapirs of this study) show that longer absolute particle MRT are linked to shorter relative fluid MRT, possibly indicating a more thorough ‘washing’ of particulate ingesta with digestive fluids at longer particle MRT. The only outlier to this general pattern, with an exceptionally high difference between fluid and particle MRT, indicating a particularly efficient ingesta washing, is the white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum). If possible, results of this study should be compared to findings in tapirs on natural diets...|$|R
50|$|The zoo has Asiatic {{lions and}} Siberian tigers, which live in former stone pits. The inner cages of both large cat species are behind a rock face {{and can be}} visited only after {{entering}} the house through a tunnel. Other carnivores are snow leopards, polar bears, Syrian brown bears, and maned wolves. The zoo is also successful in breeding South African cheetahs.Further attractions are Common bottlenose dolphins, Indian rhinoceroses, <b>Malayan</b> <b>tapirs,</b> lowland gorillas, California sea lions and manatees.|$|R
5000|$|This exhibit {{was opened}} in 2011. It {{features}} animals from Asia, and nearly doubles {{the number of}} large animals at the zoo.
