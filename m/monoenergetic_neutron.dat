40|$|We {{present the}} {{development}} of a segmented fast neutron spectrometer (FaNS- 2) based upon plastic scintillator and $^ 3 $He proportional counters. It was designed to measure both the flux and spectrum of fast neutrons in the energy range of few MeV to 1 GeV. FaNS- 2 utilizes capture-gated spectroscopy to identify neutron events and reject backgrounds. Neutrons deposit energy in the plastic scintillator before capturing on a $^ 3 $He nucleus in the proportional counters. Segmentation improves neutron energy reconstruction while the large volume of scintillator increases sensitivity to low neutron fluxes. A main goal of its design is to study comparatively low neutron fluxes, such as cosmogenic neutrons at the Earth's surface, in an underground environment, or from low-activity neutron sources. In this paper, we present details of its design and construction as well as its characterization with a calibrated $^{ 252 }$Cf source and <b>monoenergetic</b> <b>neutron</b> fields of 2. 5 MeV and 14 MeV.
