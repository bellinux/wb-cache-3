40|$|AbstractHead {{and neck}} cancers {{encompass}} malignancies in the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, hypopharynx, and salivary gland. The mainstay treatments are surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy in single modality or sequential settings. The surveillance of {{head and neck}} cancer patients varies among individuals, medical centers, and even countries. By reviewing the clinical guidelines and pertinent medical literature, we attempted to determine the optimal <b>surveillance</b> <b>schedule</b> for all stages of disease.

A complete cancer workup is performed annually in the first 3 years. Increasing frequencies or changes in diagnostic tools are suggested if there is any evidence of recurrence or metastasis. The follow-up principle in the first 3 years is on-schedule, and gradually shifts to symptom-oriented 5 years after treatment if there is no evidence of recurrence.

This problem also occurs in the FSKKP, UMP. This is because {{there is a sense of}} dissatisfaction with the exam schedule is given and the amount of surveillance between overseers assigned to the supervision of the examination. Instead, they suggested that they have the task of monitoring the distance constraints like at least two or three day gap. They would be happy if the given task is less supervision.

In video {{surveillance}} with resource-constrained {{devices such as}} wireless video sensor nodes, power conservation, intrusion detection, and security are important features to guarantee. In this paper, we intend to preserve the network lifetime while fulfilling the surveillance application needs. We take into account security by considering that a malicious attacker can try to predict {{the behavior of the}} network prior to intrusion. These considerations lead to the definition of a novel chaos-based scheduling scheme for {{video surveillance}}. We explain why the chaos-based approach can defeat malicious intruders. Then, by simulations, we also compare our chaos-based scheduling to a classical random scheduling. Results show that in addition of being able to increase the whole network lifetime and to present comparable results against random attacks (low stealth time), our scheme is also able to withstand malicious attacks due to its fully unpredictable behavior.

40|$|Objective: Women {{treated for}} endometrial cancer {{commonly}} attend clinic-based follow-up {{for up to}} five years even though there is evidence of discrepancies on effectiveness of this approach to improve survival. Furthermore, recent guidelines recommend patient education be the cornerstone for follow-up practices rather than clinical investigations such as medical imaging and tumor markers as prompt and thorough investigations of symptoms are more likely to improve survival. This current practice is based on little evidence and thus alternative models need to be investigated. The overall aim of the study is to identify currently available symptom checklists, determine the comprehensiveness of identified checklists, and generate an updated list of symptoms potentially associated with a recurrence for future testing that will lead to early recurrence detection ultimately improving survival.

40|$|Purpose: Survivorship {{care plans}} (SCPs) are tools used {{to assist in}} the {{transition}} from treatment to surveillance cancer care. However, few studies have investigated survivor and provider preferences regarding SCPs. Our purpose was to explore survi-vor and primary care provider preferences regarding content, format, and delivery of SCPs. Methods: Focus groups and provider interviews were per-formed in 2010. Five different templates were presented to study participants for their feedback. Each SCP included a treatment summary, <b>surveillance</b> <b>schedule,</b> and care plan for the same fictitious patient. Sessions were transcribed, and field notes taken. Results: Four focus groups (n 29 survivors) and five primary care providers participated. No cancer survivors had ever re-ceived a written SCP. We found clear preferences for the Jour-ney Forward format (with some modifications) and face-to-face delivery (print or electronic) to the survivor by his or her oncologist just before or soon after completion of treatment. Primary care providers preferred an abbreviated version. Conclusion: Written SCPs were endorsed by all patients and primary care providers as helpful communication tools. How-ever, if used alone, the SCP would be insufficient to ease the transition to follow-up care. Improved communication and care coordination were identified as important for survivorship care that went beyond what this document might provide...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a decision model {{for use of}} colonoscopy as a screen for colorectal cancer and for surveillance of adenomatous polyps. Colorectal cancer is the second leading causes of cancer death for {{both male and female}} in the United State. The majority of colorectal cancers develop from adenomatous polyps, but these benign neoplasia can be detected and removed during a colonoscopy before becoming malignant. Among the screening methods for colorectal cancer, colonoscopy is the method which can both observe {{the entire length of the}} colon and remove polyps during the procedure. Patient characteristics influence the risk of developing cancer, so the required testing schedule should be different for various patient groups. ^ The goal of this study is to provide colonoscopy screening and surveillance guidelines for different patient groups. This study combines a predictive model of colorectal cancer risk with associated costs for colorectal cancer, life expectancy, and patient symptoms to build a decision tree model. To account for the variations in colorectal cancer risks of different patient groups, an odds ratio analysis study was incorporated into the decision tree model to identify the high-risk patient group.

This practical demonstration makes up one part of an Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) sponsored project entitled Integrated Models, Data Bases and Practices Needed for Performance-Based Safety Regulation. Project members selected the emergency diesel generator system {{as a candidate for}} assessment because of its high risk importance for core damage frequency (CDF) as well as for its failure to exhibit fulfillment of its current maintenance objectives. An analysis of current NRC maintenance and inspection requirements of the emergency diesel generators at the Millstone 3 nuclear power plant was performed by the project members. Maintenance and inspection items identified as unnecessary or harmful to the EDG qualified as candidates for removal from the current <b>surveillance</b> <b>schedule.</b> Expert testimony and comparisons with similar non-nuclear utility industries aided in the identification of candidate items. Calculations of the subsequent risk, reliability, safety, and economic implications revealed several benefits of the inspection alterations. The modified inspection provided improved backup power availability and defense in depth during the refueling outage. A sensitivity analysis performed on the EDG basic events affected by inspection alteration showed that a 50 % reduction in these basic event failure rates would decrease the EDG system failure probability by 13. 9 %.

Method: The <b>surveillance</b> <b>schedule</b> involved evaluations at 1 month, every 3 months the first year, and then every 6 months. Salvage intervention or graft occlusion occurring within the next follow-up interval defined surveillance end points. One hundred two grafts (329 surveillance visits) had an ankle/brachial index (ABI). A duplex scanning – determined midgraft peak systolic flow velocity (PSFV) was available for 81 grafts (262 visits). Forty-eight grafts (137 visits) had both a PSFV and entire graft duplex scanning (EGDS) to determine stenosis greater than 50 %, whereas 40 grafts (91 visits) had simultaneous ABI and EGDS. Results: When a greater than 15 % decrease in ABI denoted an abnormal surveillance study result, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 24. 3 % and negative predictive value of 94. 5 % were noted. Similarly, a PSFV cutoff of less than 35 cm/sec demonstrated values of 26. 3 % and 94. 2 %, respectively. When an EGDS of greater than 50 % stenosis or a PSFV of less than 35 cm/sec were the cutoff criteria, the PPV was 36. 7 % and negative predictive value 99. 1 %, whereas characterizing abnormal results further with ABI (> 15 %↓) increased the PPV to 83. 3 %. Conclusion: The combination of an EGDS, midgraft PSFV, and ABI provides optimal follow-up for our patients with a femorodistal vein graft. (J V ASC S URG 1995; 21 : 127 - 34. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Surveillance</b> <b>schedules</b> in {{patients}} with cutaneous melanoma (CM) aim to detect metastatic spread in an early phase of development. Few studies investigated whether detection in an early phase is associated with prolonged survival and whether the observed longer survival times are a mere consequence of detection at an earlier time point (lead time bias). This is a long-term survival analysis of 1969 patients with stage I–III CM documented during 1996 – 1998 {{in the frame of}} a prospective surveillance study. Development of metastatic spread was detected in 112 patients during this period and classified as early phase or advanced phase based on tumor load and operability. The impact of lead time bias on differences in survival probabilities was examined using different statistical approaches. Of 59 patients with metastases detected in an early phase of development, 64. 4 % died of CM, of 43 patients with advanced phase metastases 86 % died (P= 0. 013). The 10 -year overall survival probability was 42. 6 % for early and 25. 6 % for advanced phase metastases (P= 0. 012). This comparison remained significant after adjustment for sojourn time. Multivariate analysis identified detection of early phase metastases (P= 0. 022) and stage at primary diagnosis (P< 0. 0001) as independent prognostic factors. In conclusion, this long-term follow-up study showed a factual gain in survival time for the detection of metastasis in an early phase of development beyond lead time bias. The classification of metastasis detected in early and advanced phase may be used in future studies aiming to improve melanoma surveillance...|$|R
40|$|Type I pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) is a rare, cystic lung {{neoplasm}} {{in infants}} characterized by subtle malignant changes {{and a good}} prognosis. Recurrences after type I PPB are usually advanced type II or type III neoplasms with a poor prognosis. This article describes the first collection of type I PPB cases, analyzes outcome based on treatments of surgery or surgery plus chemotherapy, and presents type I PPB management recommendations. Patients and Methods Type I PPB cases from the International PPB Registry and literature were evaluated using standard statistical methods for outcomes based on age at diagnosis, sex, thoracic side, surgical extent, length of follow-up, constitutional/familial disease, pre-existing lung cysts, intrathoracic findings, and treatments (surgery or surgery and chemotherapy). Results Thirty-eight type I PPB cases were identified: Registry (n 30) and literature (n 8). Twenty children had surgery alone; eight (40 %) experienced recurrence; and four died. Eighteen children had surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy; one experienced recurrence and died. All recurrences were type II or III PPB. Recurrence-free survival was higher in the surgery chemotherapy group (P. 01); overall survival did not differ (P. 18). The improved recurrence-free survival was found only in males. Four of nine children with recurrence survived. Conclusion Adjuvant chemotherapy appears to benefit type I PPB patients. Benefit limited to males requires broader substantiation. Salvage after types II and III recurrence is poor (four of nine; 44 %). A rigorous <b>surveillance</b> <b>schedule</b> after type I PPB diagnosis might detect early recurrence and be an acceptable alternative to adjuvant chemotherapy.

40|$|Purpose: There are {{few studies}} that {{have focused on the}} {{predictors}} of recurrence after gastrectomy for gastric carcinoma. This study analyzed the patients who died of recurrent gastric carcinoma and we attempted to clarify the clinicopathologic factors that are associated with the timing of recurrence. Materials and Methods: From June 1992 to March 2009, 1, 795 patients underwent curative gastric resection at the Department of Surgery, Hanyang University College of Medicine. Among them, 428 patients died and 311 of these patients who died of recurrent gastric carcinoma were enrolled in this study. The clinicopathologic findings were compared between the 72 patients who died within one year after curative gastrectomy (the early recurrence group) and the 92 patients who died 3 years after curative gastrectomy (the late recurrence group). Results: Compared with the late recurrence group, the early recurrence group showed an older age, a more advanced stage, a poorly differentiated type of cancer and a significantly higher tendency to have lymphatic invasion, vascular invasion and perineural invasion. Especially in the gastric cancer patients with a more advanced stage (stage III and IV), the early recurrence group was characterized by a significantly higher preoperative serum carcino embryonic antigen level, perineural invasion and {{a relatively small number of}} dissected lymph nodes. Conclusions: The clinicopathologic characteristics of recurrent gastric cancer are significantly different according to the stage of disease, and even in the same stage. For the early detection of recurrence after curative surgery, it is important to recognize the clinicopathological factors that foretell a high risk of recurrence.

40|$|The {{following}} {{recommendations for}} post-polypectomy endoscopic surveillance {{should be applied}} only after a high quality baseline colonoscopy with complete removal of all detected neoplastic lesions. 1 In the low risk group (patients with 1 - 2 tubular adenomas < 10 mm with low grade dysplasia), the ESGE recommends participation in existing national screening programmes 10 years after the index colonoscopy. If no screening programme is available, repetition of colonoscopy 10 years after the index colonoscopy is recommended (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). 2 In the high risk group (patients with adenomas with villous histology or high grade dysplasia or ≥ 10 mm in size, or ≥ 3 adenomas), the ESGE recommends surveillance colonoscopy 3 years after the index colonoscopy (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). Patients with 10 or more adenomas should be referred for genetic counselling (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). 3 In the high risk group, if no high risk adenomas are detected at the first surveillance examination, the ESGE suggests a 5 -year interval before a second surveillance colonoscopy (weak recommendation, low quality evidence). If high risk adenomas are detected at first or subsequent surveillance examinations, a 3 -year repetition of surveillance colonoscopy is recommended (strong recommendation, low quality evidence). 4 The ESGE recommends that patients with serrated polyps < 10 mm in size with no dysplasia should be classified as low risk (weak recommendation, low quality evidence). The ESGE suggests that patients with large serrated polyps (≥ 10 mm) or those with dysplasia should be classified as high risk (weak recommendation, low quality evidence). 5 The ESGE recommends that the endoscopist is responsible for providing a written recommendation for the post-polypectomy <b>surveillance</b> <b>schedule</b> (strong recommendation, low quality evidence...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: There {{is still}} debate whether type II endoleaks {{represent}} a {{risk for the}} patient after EVAR. Treatment policies vary from fairly conservative to active intervention. In this analysis risk factors for type II endoleak and adverse events during follow-up were assessed. In addition, risk factors and causes for conversion to open repair and for rupture post-EVAR were studied. METHODS: The data of 3595 patients, who underwent operation between 1996 and 2002 in 114 European institutions that collaborated in the EUROSTAR Registry, were assessed. To accurately assess the influence of type II endoleaks patients with type I, III and combined endoleaks {{were excluded from the}} present study cohort. RESULTS: A combined adverse outcome event consisting of aneurysmal growth, transfemoral reintervention, and transabdominal secondary procedures (including laparoscopic branch vessel clipping) occurred in 55 % in patients with type II endoleak at 3 years, compared to 15 % in patients without any endoleak (p< 0. 0001). Conversion to open repair or post-EVAR rupture was not significantly associated with type II endoleaks. An independent association of device migration and expansion of the aneurysm with late conversion was observed. The cumulative incidence of aneurysm rupture at 3 years of follow-up was 1. 2 % for an annual rate of 0. 4 %. Variables that significantly and independently correlated with rupture were size of the aneurysm at preoperative measurement and device migration during follow-up. CONCLUSION: Endoleak type II may not be harmless as it was more frequently associated with enlargement of the aneurysm and reinterventions. Large aneurysms and migration of the device were the main risk factors for rupture. The clinical implications of these findings may involve more frequent surveillance visits for patients with type II endoleak. Aneurysm expansion is a clear indication for reintervention. Patients with large aneurysms, 65 mm or larger, may also benefit from a more comprehensive <b>surveillance</b> <b>schedule...</b>|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveSurveillance for {{patients}} undergoing thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for blunt thoracic aortic injury (BTAI) varies. Annual chest computed tomographic angiography (CTA) is often recommended but {{concerns about the}} risks and costs have emerged. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the optimal follow-up frequency based on 11 -year outcomes and surveillance experience. MethodsSeventy-six patients with BTAI received TEVAR from May 2002 to July 2013. Demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, Injury Severity Score (ISS), types, sizes, timing, and outcomes of stent grafts were collected retrospectively. ResultsMean age was 39. 7 years (range, 17 - 85 years); 8 (11 %) were women. Mean ISS was 46. 2 ± 18. 5 (deceased, 61. 0 ± 19. 2; surviving, 44. 2 ± 17. 6; P = . 023). Technical success was achieved in 71 patients (93. 4 %). All-cause mortality was 7 (9. 2 %), 1 (1. 3 %) of which was related to the procedure. Six were lost to follow-up (8 %). To examine the effect of surveillance frequency on outcomes, after excluding the 2 most recent (6  months after scheduled annual visit). No significant differences were found for survival, graft-related complications, need for reintervention, except for postoperative hypertension, which was higher in the first group. All surviving patients had excellent outcomes, with no cerebrovascular accidents, paraplegia, or paraparesis; the median follow-up for both groups was 3 years (interquartile range 2. 0 - 3. 5, 1. 5 - 5. 4 years). ConclusionsMidterm outcomes of TEVAR {{for patients}} with stable repair after BTAI are excellent, both with timely (1. 0 - 1. 5 years) and delayed (> 1. 5 years) follow-up intervals after a median surveillance period of 3 years. A larger prospective randomized study could lead to a more relaxed, but equally safe <b>surveillance</b> <b>schedule</b> for these patients, lowering risks and costs...|$|R
