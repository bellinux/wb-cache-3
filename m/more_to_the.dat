Turning <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west, Chanchu made landfall on Samar in the eastern Philippines on May11. Despite moving through the archipelago, Chanchu intensified slightly within the Sibuyan Sea, striking Mindoro on May12 with 1minute winds of 160km/h (100mph), according to the JTWC. On May13, Chanchu emerged into the South China Sea, and later that day the JMA upgraded it to typhoon status.|$|E

5|$|A low {{pressure}} persisted {{toward the end}} of April between Diego Garcia and the equator. It developed a spiral area of convection on April24, which preceded the development of a tropical disturbance the next day. By that time, the system was already at tropical storm status and was given the name Karla. Moving southwest, the storm strengthened and organized. A ridge to the south steered Karla to the east on April27, although an approaching trough turned it to the southeast on the following day. Enhanced atmospheric instability helped the storm strengthen to tropical cyclone status on April29. On the next day, Karla attained peak winds of 170km/h (105mph) after developing a well-defined eye. Increased wind shear and progressively cooler waters weakened the cyclone as it turned <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south. By May3, the storm weakened to tropical depression status and dissipated the next day within the westerlies.|$|E

Here, CR 530 turns south to follow CR 539 and Route 70 continues northeast back into the Pine Barrens. The road turns <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north-northeast before heading east into Lakehurst to the south of the Lakehurst Naval Air Station. In Lakehurst, Route 70 comes to a traffic circle with CR 4 and CR 12 before running through residential and commercial areas of the town. It intersects with the southern terminus of CR 547, where it widens into a four-lane divided highway. From here, the route crosses over Conrail Shared Assets Operations' Southern Secondary railroad line before coming to the Lakehurst Circle, where it intersects the western terminus of Route 37.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave exited western Africa on August13, {{which developed}} into Tropical Storm Baker {{east of the}} Lesser Antilles on August18. It moved northwestward and later turned to the west, attaining hurricane status on August21. The next day, the hurricane attained Category 2 intensity just as it crossed over Antigua, where heavy damage was reported. More than 100homes were damaged or destroyed, which left thousands homeless. Afterward, the hurricane began to weaken, and later on August22 its winds decreased to tropical storm status. The cyclone then struck Montserrat as a strong tropical storm. The next day it struck southwestern Puerto Rico, and shortly thereafter weakened into a tropical depression, passing over the Dominican Republic. Baker turned <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west, re-attaining tropical storm status before striking eastern Cuba on August24. In Cuba, 37 people died, and the property losses reached several million dollars.|$|E

5|$|After {{becoming}} a named storm, Leon turned <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west-southwest, {{due to a}} trough weakening the ridge to the south. The storm developed increased convective banding, aided by decreasing wind shear, and quickly intensified. Early on February5, the PTCWC upgraded Leon to a Category3 on the Australian scale, estimating 10‑minute winds of 120km/h (75mph). At 22:00UTC that day, the agency estimated an initial peak of 140km/h (85mph). On February6, the cyclone developed an eye {{in the center of}} the convection that was only visible on Special sensor microwave/imager, not on satellite imagery. On the same day, the JTWC upgraded Leon to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, estimating 1‑minute winds of 140km/h (85mph). A trough passing to the south increased wind shear, causing the storm to weaken. Around that time, Leon passed about 510km (315mi) south of the Cocos Islands, while turning <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west after the ridge strengthened to the south. By February8, the circulation was exposed from the rapidly dwindling thunderstorms. At 18:00UTC that day, Leon crossed 90°E into the south-west Indian Ocean, and as result was renamed Eline by the Mauritius Meteorological Service. By that time, Météo-France (MFR) estimated 10‑minute winds of 65km/h (40mph).|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, Eline was still encountering wind shear and dry air. Despite these factors, the eye became better defined and the storm intensified, aided by favoring upper-level conditions. The cyclone turned <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west toward Madagascar, despite a {{weakness in the}} ridge to the south. While approaching the country, Eline quickly intensified, reaching 10‑minute winds of 165km/h (105mph) by 18:00UTC on February17. Around that time, the cyclone made landfall on eastern Madagascar near Mahanoro. Eline rapidly weakened over land while moving to the west-southwest, and the JTWC downgraded the storm to tropical depression status within 18hours of moving ashore.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} a tropical storm, Edouard quickly strengthened {{due to the}} establishment of an upper-level anticyclone over the storm. The storm moved to the west in response to a strong subtropical ridge to its north, and Edouard strengthened into a hurricane on August 23. Due to very favorable conditions, the hurricane rapidly strengthened on August 24 and August 25 to peak as a 145mph (230km/h) Category4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. A weakness in the subtropical ridge allowed for a motion <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west-northwest, and the hurricane passed about 250mi (400km) north of the Lesser Antilles on August 28. For three days during this time, Edouard maintained Category4 intensity, though weakened late on August 28 due to an eyewall replacement cycle and vertical shear.|$|E

5|$|After {{continuing}} through the southeast United States, the storm became extratropical {{near the border}} of North Carolina and Virginia midday on September18. Although it initially maintained tropical storm-force winds, the former hurricane weakened below gale-force on September19 while it was near Philadelphia. The storm continued rapidly to the northeast, moving through New England and {{along the coast of}} Maine before turning <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east. Late on September19, the storm moved across Nova Scotia, passing southeast of Newfoundland the next day. It was last observed late on September20 dissipating to the east of Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|After {{its first}} peak in intensity, Nangka {{slightly}} weakened as convection {{along the west}} side of the system was restricted due to the TUTT cell, and the eye became cloud-filled. Decreasing wind shear and increasing sea surface temperatures allowed the intensification trend to resume, and the structure became more symmetric late on July8 as it moved toward the Northern Marianas Islands. A well-defined inner eye re-developed inside of an outer eyewall. On July9, the JTWC upgraded Nangka to a super typhoon, estimating peak 1minute winds of 250km/h (155mph). The JMA also assessed a 10minute peak of 185km/h (115mph). At 06:00UTC on July9, the eye of Nangka passed over the uninhabited island of Alamagan. The typhoon later weakened while turning <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west due to increased wind shear. The eye became cloud-filled and was no longer visible by July11, although the organization was sustained by good outflow to the south. However, the convection reorganized the next day and the eye reformed. By that time, Nangka was slowing and nearly stationary as the subtropical ridge receded to the east.|$|E
5|$|After {{moving through}} the southwestern Caribbean Sea, Bret began to re-develop {{convection}} as upper-level conditions became more favorable. By early on August10, surface observations confirmed {{the presence of a}} low-level circulation, and the NHC re-issued advisories on the system. The convection continued to organize, prompting the NHC to upgrade Bret again to a tropical storm. The storm strengthened slightly further to a secondary peak of 45mph (75km/h). Around 17:00UTC on August10, Bret made its final landfall in southern Nicaragua near Bahia Punta Gorda. The circulation moved through the country and turned <b>more</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west-northwest. Operationally, it was believed that Bret survived after crossing Central America and entered the eastern Pacific, as the NHC designated it Tropical Depression Eight-E. Post-storm analysis determined otherwise that Bret dissipated over western Nicaragua, near the Pacific coast on August11. The remnants continued to the west-northwest, eventually developing into a tropical depression on August15 off the west coast of Mexico. The system eventually became Hurricane Greg with peak winds of 135mph (215km/h), which lasted until August28.|$|E
