40|$|This study {{presents}} a tool - the Landscape Identity Implicit Association Test (LI-IAT) - devoted {{to measure the}} implicit identification with European <b>and</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> landscapes. To this aim, a series of prototypical landscapes was selected as stimulus, following an accurate multi-step procedure. Participants (N = 174), recruited in two Italian cities, performed two LI-IATs devoted to assess their identification with European vs. Not-European <b>and</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> vs. Not-Mediterranean prototypical landscapes. Psychometric properties and criterion validity of these measures were investigated. Two self-report measures, assessing, respectively, European <b>and</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> place identity <b>and</b> pleasantness of the target landscapes, were also administered. Results showed: (1) an adequate level of internal consistency for both LI-IATs; (2) a higher identification with European <b>and</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> landscapes than, respectively, with Not-European and Not-Mediterranean ones; and (3) a significant positive relationship between the European <b>and</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> LI-IATs <b>and</b> the corresponding place identity scores, also when pleasantness of landscapes was controlled for. Overall, these findings provide a first evidence supporting the reliability and criterion validity of the European <b>and</b> <b>Mediterranean</b> LI-IATs...|$|R
