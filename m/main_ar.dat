40|$|Control of {{electron}} energy distributions {{is one of}} the most important and challenging issues in low temperature plasma science and technology. Several approaches have been investigated, including pulsed plasma power [1], dual frequency operation [1] and ultrahigh frequency operation. [2] Here we introduce a new approach. Energetic particles (electrons, positive ions, negative ions, photons, fast neutrals, metastables, or combinations) from a tandem plasma are injected into the main plasma, to influence the EEDF of the main plasma. The two plasmas are separated by a grid, and have separate control of the power and to some extend gas composition. By applying a positive bias to a boundary electrode on the tandem plasma, we raise its plasma potential and expel positive ions through the grid with an energy equal to the bias voltage. This ion injection increased the plasma density in the <b>main</b> <b>Ar</b> plasma beneath by 22 % for 80 eV ions, with an onset at 30 eV, close to the threshold energ...|$|E

Alkylresorcinols in plasma (200 μL) and adipose tissues (10 – 50 mg) were extracted with diethyl ether, whereas <b>main</b> <b>AR</b> metabolites such as DHBA and DHPPA and newly identified metabolites in urine (50 μL) were extracted with ethyl acetate after enzymatic deconjugation. All extracts were purified on OASIS-MAX solid phase extraction cartridges. Plasma and adipose tissue sample extracts were then derivatised with trifluoroacetic anhydride and reconstituted in undecane, whereas AR metabolites in urine samples were derivatised with BSTFA+TMCS (99 : 1, v/v, 100 μL). Prepared samples were quantified by GC–MS (EI-SIM). Analysis of all compounds in the different matrices showed good selectivity, sensitivity, linearity, precision (< 15 % within and between batches), adequate recovery (75 – 108 %), and short total run time (10 – 12 min).

40|$|Persistent plasma upflows were {{observed}} with Hinode's EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) {{at the edges}} of active region (AR) 10978 as it crossed the solar disk. We analyze the evolution of the photospheric magnetic and velocity fields of the AR, model its coronal magnetic field, and compute the location of magnetic null-points and quasi-sepratrix layers (QSLs) searching for the origin of EIS upflows. Magnetic reconnection at the computed null points cannot explain all of the observed EIS upflow regions. However, EIS upflows and QSLs are found to evolve in parallel, both temporarily and spatially. Sections of two sets of QSLs, called outer and inner, are found associated to EIS upflow streams having different characteristics. The reconnection process in the outer QSLs is forced by a large-scale photospheric flow pattern which is present in the AR for several days. We propose a scenario in which upflows are observed provided a large enough asymmetry in plasma pressure exists between the pre-reconnection loops and for as long as a photospheric forcing is at work. A similar mechanism operates in the inner QSLs, in this case, it is forced by the emergence and evolution of the bipoles between the two <b>main</b> <b>AR</b> polarities. Our findings provide strong support to the results from previous individual case studies investigating the role of magnetic reconnection at QSLs as the origin of the upflowing plasma. Furthermore, we propose that persistent reconnection along QSLs does not only drive the EIS upflows, but it is also responsible for a continuous metric radio noise-storm observed in AR 10978 along its disk transit by the Nançay Radio Heliograph.

40|$|AR 5 is {{the most}} {{detailed}} land cover dataset in Norway, with a minimum mapping unit 500 square meters. The AR 5 dataset classifies all land of Norway into several classes with {{the main purpose of}} representing current land use and production potential for forest and agricultural crops. The <b>main</b> <b>AR</b> 5 classification is on surface type, and there are supplementary classifications on forest production potential, forest cover type and soil condition. AR 5 is a discrete coverage dataset consisting of polygonal units that is a result of a human classification based on observations of a complex set of biological and environmental factors that vary more or less continuously in space. The Norwegian municipalities (400 +) are responsible for the daily maintenance of the AR 5 dataset, according to its specification. The national dataset is obtained by collecting the master databases from the municipalities periodically. This involves harmonisation, with respect to topology and classification, of the (local) master databases to achieve national coverage. We investigate different solutions to our main challenge: How can we efficiently maintain a seamless national AR 5 dataset from hundreds of autonomous, heterogeneous database systems distributed throughout Norway? 1 AR 5 – contents and management AR 5 {{is the most}} detailed land cover dataset in Norway [12].

40|$|Arsenic {{resistance}} is commonly clustered in ars operons in bacteria; <b>main</b> <b>ars</b> operon components encode an arsenate reductase, a membrane extrusion protein, and an As-sensitive transcription factor. In the As-resistant thermophile Thermus thermophilus HB 27, genes encoding homologues of these proteins are interspersed in the chromosome. In this article, {{we show that}} two adjacent genes, TtsmtB, encoding an ArsR/SmtB transcriptional repressor and, TTC 0354, encoding a Zn 2 +/Cd 2 +-dependent membrane ATPase are involved in As resistance; differently from characterized ars operons, the two genes are transcribed from dedicated promoters upstream of their respective genes, whose expression is differentially regulated at transcriptional level. Mutants defective in TtsmtB or TTC 0354 are more sensitive to As than the wild type, proving their role in arsenic resistance. Recombinant dimeric TtSmtB binds in vitro to both promoters, but its binding capability decreases upon interaction with arsenate and, less efficiently, with arsenite. In vivo and in vitro experiments also demonstrate that the arsenate reductase (TtArsC) is subjected to regulation by TtSmtB. We propose {{a model for the}} regulation of As resistance in T. thermophilus in which TtSmtB is the arsenate sensor responsible for the induction of TtArsC which generates arsenite exported by TTC 0354 efflux protein to detoxify cells...|$|R

40|$|An {{automated}} atmospheric river (AR) detection {{algorithm is}} used for the North Atlantic Ocean basin, allowing the identification of the major ARs affecting western European coasts between 1979 and 2012 over the winter half-year (October to March). The entire western coast of Europe was divided into five domains, namely the Iberian Peninsula (9. 75 ° W, 36 – 43. 75 ° N), France (4. 5 ° W, 43. 75 – 50 ° N), UK (4. 5 ° W, 50 – 59 ° N), southern Scandinavia and the Netherlands (5. 25 ° E, 50 – 59 ° N), and northern Scandinavia (5. 25 ° E, 59 – 70 ° N). Following the identification of the <b>main</b> <b>ARs</b> that made landfall in western Europe, a Lagrangian analysis was then applied in order to identify the main areas where the moisture uptake was anomalous and contributed to the ARs reaching each domain. The Lagrangian data set used was obtained from the FLEXPART (FLEXible PARTicle dispersion) model global simulation from 1979 to 2012 and was forced by ERA-Interim reanalysis on a 1 ° latitude–longitude grid. The results show that, in general, for all regions considered, the major climatological areas for the anomalous moisture uptake extend along the subtropical North Atlantic, from the Florida Peninsula (northward of 20 ° N) to each sink region, with the nearest coast to each sink region always appearing as a local maximum. In addition, during AR events the Atlantic subtropical source is reinforced and displaced, with a slight northward movement of the sources found when the sink region is positioned at higher latitudes. In conclusion, the results confirm not only the anomalous advection of moisture linked to ARs from subtropical ocean areas but also the existence of a tropical source, together with midlatitude anomaly sources at some locations closer to AR landfalls...|$|R

In fact, the opposite is frequently true: By considering the evolution of the underlying distributions, rather than the state itself, a linear system is obtained. This is the basis of a development of Markov models that parallels the theory of linear state space models, with or without control. In particular, spectral theory and Lyapunov theory play a fundamental role in analysis and design.
