25|$|For instance, {{experts are}} advocating that the U.S. federal {{government}} launch a National Infrastructure Foundation, a nimble, collaborative strategic intervention organization that will house innovations programs from fragmented silos under one entity, inform federal officials on innovation performance metrics, strengthen industry-university partnerships, and support innovation economic development initiatives, especially to strengthen regional clusters. Because clusters are the geographic incubators of innovative products and processes, a cluster development grant program {{would also be}} targeted for implementation. By focusing on innovating {{in such areas as}} precision <b>manufacturing,</b> <b>information</b> technology, and clean energy, other areas of national concern would be tackled including government debt, carbon footprint, and oil dependence. The U.S. Economic Development Administration understand this reality in their continued Regional Innovation Clusters initiative. In addition, federal grants in R, a crucial driver of innovation and productive growth, should be expanded to levels similar to Japan, Finland, South Korea, and Switzerland in order to stay globally competitive. Also, such grants should be better procured to metropolitan areas, the essential engines of the American economy.|$|E
25|$|Archaeological {{samples of}} the gun, {{specifically}} the hand cannon (huochong), have been dated starting from the 13th century. The oldest extant gun whose dating is unequivocal is the Xanadu Gun, so called because it was discovered {{in the ruins of}} Xanadu, the Mongol summer palace in Inner Mongolia. The Xanadu Gun is 34.7cm in length and weighs 6.2kg. Its dating is based on archaeological context and a straightforward inscription whose era name and year corresponds with the Gregorian Calendar at 1298. Not only does the inscription contain the era name and date, it also includes a serial number and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>information</b> which suggests that gun production had already become systematized, or at least become a somewhat standardized affair by the time of its fabrication. The design of the gun includes axial holes in its rear which some speculate could have been used in a mounting mechanism. Like most early guns {{with the possible exception of}} the Western Xia gun, it is small, weighing just over six kilograms and thirty-five centimeters in length. Although the Xanadu Gun is the most precisely dated gun from the 13th century, other extant samples with approximate dating likely predate it.|$|E
500|$|On January 26, 1875, Bristow ordered Internal Revenue {{officers}} in various sites to different locations, effective February 15, 1875, on a suggestion from Grant. This {{would keep the}} fraudulent officers off guard and allow investigators to uncover their misdeeds. Grant later rescinded the order {{on the grounds that}} advance notice would cause the ringleaders to cover their tracks and become suspicious. Rescinding Secretary Bristow's order would later give rise to a rumor that Grant was interfering with the investigation. [...] Although moving the supervisors most certainly would have disrupted the ring, Bristow conceded that he would need documentary evidence on the ring's inner workings to prosecute the perpetrators. Bristow, undaunted, kept investigating, and found the ring's secrets by sending Myron Colony and other spies to gather whiskey shipping and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>information.</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractSince the <b>manufacturing</b> process <b>information</b> {{and their}} mutual {{relationship}} {{are complex and}} diverse, the clear and accurate description and modeling of <b>manufacturing</b> process <b>information</b> is a challenge in related study of manufacturing process. Considering {{the diversity of the}} process data, a four-layer framework for <b>manufacturing</b> process <b>information</b> modeling based on metamodel is proposed. A 4 -tuple <b>manufacturing</b> process <b>information</b> metamodel is specified and the concepts and relationships of the <b>manufacturing</b> process <b>information</b> are represented by UML. Following the four-layer hierarchical modeling procedures in the framework, <b>manufacturing</b> process <b>information</b> can be modeled from metamodel to model in consistence with their data relationships and representations.

40|$|Abstract—Sources of the <b>information</b> <b>manufacturing</b> {{system can}} be {{integrated}} with the data storage system in different degrees. Lowly integrated <b>information</b> <b>manufacturing</b> system uses multiple data storage system for storing data in the <b>information</b> <b>manufacturing</b> system. As a result, lowly integrated <b>information</b> <b>manufacturing</b> system {{was the cause of}} some data quality problems. Therefore, highly integrated <b>information</b> <b>manufacturing</b> system is installed in the organizations. Highly integrated <b>information</b> <b>manufacturing</b> system store data in one single data storage system. Refreshment and query function are to execute in the data storage system of <b>information</b> <b>manufacturing</b> system for making data available and for information support respectively. The tasks of the refreshment function (data loading, indexing) execute sequentially in the single data storage system oriented <b>information</b> <b>manufacturing</b> system. Further, a highly integrated <b>information</b> <b>manufacturing</b> system is developed for executing the tasks of refreshment and query function simultaneously in data storage system. This highly integrated <b>information</b> <b>manufacturing</b> system is the 3 - data storage system oriented <b>information</b> <b>manufacturing</b> system. These highly integrated <b>information</b> <b>manufacturing</b> system could also cause the data quality problems regarding the completeness, accuracy and timeliness data quality dimensions. Therefore, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to show a comparative data quality scenario of both of these highly integrated <b>information</b> <b>manufacturing</b> system. As a result, simulated highly integrated single and 3 -data storage system oriented <b>information</b> <b>manufacturing</b> system is developed for assessing the data quality of these two <b>information</b> <b>manufacturing</b> system.

40|$|Information {{integration}} and interoperability among different design and manufacturing application software systems {{are important in}} smart manufacturing implementation and product life cycle management. Information models are foundational and critical to the specification of common terms, interfaces, and software architectures for <b>information</b> interoperability. The <b>manufacturing</b> process {{is one of the}} key processes in a product life cycle. This paper presents a methodology of using the metamodels as the modeling basis in <b>manufacturing</b> process <b>information</b> modeling. A <b>manufacturing</b> process <b>information</b> metamodel (MPIMM), which consists of object classes, relationship classes, and relationships, defines the information and relationships of processes, operations, resources used, and product/part manufactured of manufacturing process planning. The MPIMM is built by unified modeling language (UML) while the semantics of the process elements and their attributes are specified referencing the process specification language. A four-layer framework is proposed to construct <b>manufacturing</b> process <b>information</b> model (MPIM) following the rules of metamodeling, and including meta-metamodeling, <b>manufacturing</b> process <b>information</b> metamodeling, and <b>manufacturing</b> process domain <b>information</b> modeling; thus, <b>manufacturing</b> process plan data can be represented. The UML profile extension mechanism realized by defining Stereotype, TaggedValue, and Constraint is used in extending MPIMM to MPIM. A case study of applying MPIM in the product life cycle data management system for port hoisting equipment manufacturing is provided to demonstrate and verify the modeling capability and efficiency of the proposed methodology.
