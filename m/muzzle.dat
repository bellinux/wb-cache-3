5|$|It {{has a long}} broad {{nose and}} <b>muzzle,</b> with thick ears covered in silky hair that usually end around {{the tip of the}} <b>muzzle.</b> Its chest is of medium size that descends down to the same level as the elbows. Both the {{forequarters}} and the hindquarters are well muscled. Its tail typically does not extend beyond the hock and is normally straight.|$|E
5|$|The {{swell of}} the <b>muzzle</b> {{refers to the}} slight swell in the {{diameter}} of the piece {{at the very end of}} the chase. It is often chamfered on the inside to make loading the cannon easier. In some guns, this element is replaced with a wide ring and is called a <b>muzzle</b> band.|$|E

50|$|<b>Muzzles</b> are {{sometimes}} used on untrained dogs, large or small, to prevent unwanted biting or scavenging. They {{can also be}} used on dogs who display aggression, whether motivated by excitement, fear or prey drive. They are usually made with a strong buckle or other fastening device to ensure that they do not come off accidentally. <b>Muzzles</b> are also used on dogs when there is a risk of them taking baits that have been laid for vermin. The most suitable materials for dog <b>muzzles</b> are leather, nylon, plastic and others. The most comfortable <b>muzzles</b> for dogs are those with wire cage construction. <b>Muzzles</b> of this kind give enough freedom for a dog to eat, drink and freely pant. The latter two are of vital importance, especially in hot weather.|$|R

5|$|When {{referring}} to cannon, the term gun {{is often used}} incorrectly. In military usage, a gun is a cannon with a high <b>muzzle</b> velocity and comparatively flat trajectory, as opposed to other types of artillery, such as howitzers or mortars, which have lower <b>muzzle</b> velocities, and usually fire indirectly.|$|E

5|$|Jaws: The jaws {{should be}} strong and powerful. The <b>muzzle</b> should be of medium length {{and should not be}} too tapered. The jaws should hang {{slightly}} and curve gracefully back.|$|E
50|$|All baboons have long, dog-like <b>muzzles,</b> heavy, {{powerful}} jaws {{with sharp}} canine teeth, close-set eyes, thick fur except on their <b>muzzles,</b> short tails, and rough spots on their protruding buttocks, called ischial callosities. These calluses are nerveless, hairless pads of skin that {{provide for the}} sitting comfort of the baboon.|$|R

2500|$|Greyhounds wear <b>muzzles</b> during racing, {{which can}} lead some to believe they are {{aggressive}} dogs, {{but this is not}} true. <b>Muzzles</b> are worn to prevent injuries resulting from dogs nipping one another during or immediately after a race, when the 'hare' has disappeared out of sight and the dogs are no longer racing but remain excited.|$|R
5|$|M3A1 (1942) - {{version with}} {{threaded}} barrel end {{to accept a}} <b>muzzle</b> brake, which was never issued.|$|E
5|$|Some {{minor changes}} in the gun {{construction}} were introduced during production. The carriage received a modified shoulder guard and traverse controls (carriage M4A1, standardized on 29 January 1942). Although ordnance requested an upgrade of all M4 carriages to M4A1, this process was not completed. Another change was a threaded barrel end to accept a big five-port <b>muzzle</b> brake (gun M3A1, adopted on 5 March 1942). According to some sources, the latter was intended to avoid kicking too much dust {{in front of the}} gun, which hindered aiming; however, the brake {{turned out to be a}} safety problem when firing canister ammunition and consequently the M3A1 went into combat without the <b>muzzle</b> brake. Other sources mention the <b>muzzle</b> brake was intended to soften a recoil and they say that it was dropped simply because additional recoil control measures were not really needed.|$|E

6000|$|Your {{mention of}} the late Sultan touches me nearly. He was the finest dog I ever saw, and between him and me there was a perfect understanding. But, to adopt the popular phrase, it was so very {{confidential}} that it [...] "went no further." [...] He would fly at anybody else with the greatest enthusiasm for destruction. I saw him, <b>muzzled,</b> pound {{into the heart of}} a regiment of the line; and I have frequently seen him, <b>muzzled,</b> hold a great dog down with his chest and feet. He has broken loose (<b>muzzled)</b> and come home covered with blood, again and again. And yet he never disobeyed me, unless he had first laid hold of a dog.|$|R
5|$|The guns used three {{different}} charges, {{depending on the}} situation: a full charge, a full flashless charge, and a reduced charge. The standard full charge weighed 15.2–15.5lb (6.9–7.0kg), the flashless charge was slightly heavier at 16lb (7.3kg), and the reduced charge was significantly smaller, at 3.6lb (1.6kg). Both full charges provided a <b>muzzle</b> velocity of 2,600ft/s (790m/s) in new guns, but as continued fire wore down the barrels, <b>muzzle</b> velocity degraded slightly, to 2,500ft/s (760m/s). The reduced charge's <b>muzzle</b> velocity was correspondingly lower, at 1,200ft/s (370m/s). Each gun was supplied with 450 rounds, and was expected to fire 4,600 shells before it was worn enough to warrant replacement. At the maximum effective elevation to engage surface targets, 45degrees, the guns could hit targets up to 17,392yards (15,903m) away. The maximum height at which aircraft could be engaged was 37,200feet (11,900m).|$|E

5|$|When {{referring}} to cannon, the term gun {{is often used}} incorrectly. In military usage, a gun is a cannon with a high <b>muzzle</b> velocity and a flat trajectory, useful for hitting the sides of targets such as walls, as opposed to howitzers or mortars, which have lower <b>muzzle</b> velocities, and fire indirectly, lobbing shells up and over obstacles to hit the target from above.|$|E
5|$|Due to city regulations, the Master and Mistress {{are forced}} to <b>muzzle</b> Lad when they take him from the show. During the drive out of the city, Lad falls {{out of the car}} and is left behind. After he realizes he is lost, Lad starts towards home. Along the way he is chased by the police and a crowd of people, who presume he is rabid, but he escapes them by {{swimming}} across the Hudson River. Later he is attacked by a mongrel guard dog, but he refuses to run from the battle. He initially struggles to defend himself while muzzled, but then the other dog inadvertently bites through the strap holding the <b>muzzle</b> on, allowing Lad to quickly defeat him. When the Master and Mistress return from searching for Lad, they find him waiting on the porch.|$|E

5|$|The {{older and}} more-stable forms of cannon were muzzle-loading {{as opposed to}} breech-loading— {{in order to be}} used they had to have their {{ordnance}} packed down the bore through the <b>muzzle</b> rather than inserted through the breech.|$|E
5|$|A broad <b>muzzle</b> {{is found}} on the river otter's flat head, and the ears are round and inconspicuous. The rhinarium is bare, with an obtuse, {{triangular}} projection. Eyes of the animal are small and placed anteriorly. A short, broad rostrum for exhaling and a long, broad cranium define the relatively flat skull. The river otter's nostrils and ears close during submersion, inhibiting water from entering them. Its vibrissae (whiskers) are long and thick, enhancing sensory perception underwater and on land.|$|E
