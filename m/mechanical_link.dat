500|$|The {{operation}} of a crank handle powers several different mechanisms inside Tipu's Tiger. A set of bellows expels air through a pipe inside the man's throat, with its opening at his mouth. This produces a wailing sound, simulating the cries of distress of the victim. A <b>mechanical</b> <b>link</b> causes the man's left arm to rise and fall. This action alters the pitch of the 'wail pipe'. Another mechanism inside the tiger's head expels air through a single pipe with two tones. This produces a [...] "regular grunting sound" [...] simulating {{the roar of the}} tiger. Concealed behind a flap in the tiger's flank is the small ivory keyboard of a two-stop pipe organ in the tiger's body, allowing tunes to be played.|$|E

40|$|A {{universal}} {{input device}} for interfacing a human operator with a slave machine {{such as a}} robot or the like includes a plurality of serially connected <b>mechanical</b> <b>links</b> extending from a base. A handgrip {{is connected to the}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>links</b> distal from the base such that a human operator may grasp the handgrip and control the position thereof relative to the base through the <b>mechanical</b> <b>links.</b> A plurality of rotary joints is arranged to connect the <b>mechanical</b> <b>links</b> together to provide at least three translational degrees of freedom and at least three rotational degrees of freedom of motion of the handgrip relative to the base. A cable and pulley assembly for each joint is connected to a corresponding motor for transmitting forces from the slave machine to the handgrip to provide kinesthetic feedback to the operator and for producing control signals that may be transmitted from the handgrip to the slave machine. The device gives excellent kinesthetic feedback, high-fidelity force/torque feedback, a kinematically simple structure, mechanically decoupled motion in all six degrees of freedom, and zero backlash. The device also has a much larger work envelope, greater stiffness and responsiveness, smaller stowage volume, and better overlap of the human operator's range of motion than previous designs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Pollution {{problems}} in medium and large cities of Europe are major concerns today, {{being one of}} the biggest contributors the vehicles used for transportation of people and goods. Simultaneously, to reduce costs and improve design and production flexibility, the automotive industries are replacing <b>mechanical</b> <b>links</b> with electronic systems, leading to the so-called X-by-wire systems. This paper relates with these concerns and trends and presents an on-going project to adapt accordingly a small vehicle, initially based on an internal combustion engine, which will be transformed in an electric vehicle named Veículo Eléctrico Isento de Licença de condução- VEIL. In this initial phase, the focus is placed on the accelerator control system, already designed with an X-by-wire architecture in mind. In future work, the VEIL <b>mechanical</b> <b>links</b> will be replaced progressively by electronic actuators to arrive at a full X-by-wire car...|$|R

5000|$|The term [...] "blower" [...] is {{commonly}} used to define a device placed on engines with a functional need for additional airflow using a direct <b>mechanical</b> <b>link</b> as its energy source. The term blower is used to describe different types of superchargers. A screw type supercharger, Roots type supercharger, and a centrifugal supercharger are all types of blowers. Conversely, a turbocharger, using exhaust compression to spin its turbine, and not a direct <b>mechanical</b> <b>link,</b> is not generally regarded as a [...] "blower" [...] but simply a [...] "turbo".|$|E
40|$|<b>Mechanical</b> <b>links</b> between {{locomotion}} and respiration {{are inherently}} appealing {{because they may}} {{lower the cost of}} respiration, but they may also limit the ability to adapt ventilation appropriately to physiological needs. Although correlative evidence supports several linkage mechanisms, <b>mechanical</b> <b>links</b> contribute < 20 % of the tidal volume in exercising animals. Observations of consistent integer relationships between breathing and stride cycles in exercising birds and mammals date from Marey's observations in the last century. The tight temporal correlation between locomotor and respiratory cycles in animals such as hopping wallabies, galloping dogs and horses, and flying bats has led investigators to propose that during locomotion, muscles of exercising limbs provide {{some or all of the}} work of breathing. In this paper, we discuss the possible advantages and disadvantages of mechanical linkages between locomotion and breathing, consider mechanical mechanisms that could link these two activities, an...|$|R

Comparison between the translational effect and the rotational effect on energy transmission shows that although both effects are important for the transmission mechanism analysis, the rotational effect on energy transmission is more remarkable at high frequencies for a soft translational link; whereas is insensitive for a stiff one.
