The caveat with this is {{that there have been}} difficulties in both prediction and inference for complex diseases. Therefore, unless individuals have an overwhelming high or low number of risk alleles, {{there is a limit to}} the predictive accuracy of their ‘genomic profiles’. However, preliminary examples of predictive genomics for personalising healthcare include: using an individuals gene expression data to monitor progress to treatment, or using the genomic profile of the P450 drug <b>metabolising</b> <b>system</b> of individuals to assist dosage and selection.|$|E
40|$|Aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) induced rat {{liver cancer}} is a well studied system of hepatocarcinogenesis. AFB 1 has also been used to {{transform}} cultured rat liver derived cells in vitro. Cells in culture often have a reduced capacity to metabolise the AFB 1 to its active metabolite, and often prolonged periods {{of exposure to the}} toxin have to be employed, with a long latency in the appearance of transformed cells in culture. We report here the transformation of a rat liver derived cell line by acute treatment with AFB 1. An extrinsic <b>metabolising</b> <b>system</b> of quail microsomes, which convert AFB 1 to its epoxide form with high efficiency, was used to activate the AFB 1. A dose dependent cytotoxicity was obtained and neoplastic transformation was seen in the higher doses used. The enzyme GGT which has strong association with liver cell transformation both in vivo and in vitro was also elevated in the treated cells...|$|E
40|$|We have {{evaluated}} the cytotoxicity {{of a series}} of novel anti-tubercular 2 -pyridyl carboxamidrazones through incubation with human mononuclear leucocytes (MNL), with and without a rat microsomal <b>metabolising</b> <b>system.</b> Isoniazid (INH), the closest structurally related agent, was used as a positive control. Incubation of the 3 -benzyloxy-benzylidene, dimethylpropyl-benzylidene and 4 -phenyl-benzylidene with MNL showed no significant toxicity in comparison with either INH or DMSO vehicle control. However, the 4 -N,N-dimethylamino- 1 -naphthylidene derivative exerted more than sevenfold greater toxicity compared with INH, while the 4 -N,N-dimethylamino- 1 -naphthylidene, 2 -benzyloxy- 3 -methoxy-benzylidene, 2 -t-butylthio-benzylidene and 4 -i-propyl-benzylidene derivatives showed toxicity which ranged from five to fourfold that of INH. In the presence of either rat microsomes with or without NADPH, the 3 -benzyloxy-benzylidene, dimethylpropyl-benzylidene and 4 -phenyl-benzylidene derivatives showed no metabolically-mediated cytotoxicity. The latter two derivatives showed a combination of low toxicity and considerable efficacy against Mycobacteria tuberculosis in vitro and show promise for future development. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Abstract: Polypharmacy as {{a result}} of combating co-infections, or {{combination}} therapy for better efficacy and reducing the emergency of drug resistance, is on the increase in the African clinical setting in the advent of HIV/AIDS, and tuber-culosis (TB) co-infections, and increasing incidences of malaria and other tropical infections. The clinicians and pharma-cists are therefore faced with the challenge of prescribing drugs in combinations that are likely to result in severe adverse effects or compromising treatment success. The aim of this study was, therefore, to develop a simple stand alone or net-work based experimental computational tool to assist doctors and pharmacists in detecting drug combinations likely to re-sult in undesirable metabolism based drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and offer alternate safe prescription options. The mechanism of most drug-drug interactions is through inhibition and induction of drug metabolising enzymes. Models for the prediction of reversible and irreversible inhibitors of the major drug <b>metabolising</b> enzyme <b>system,</b> cytochrome P 450, were used in developing the pharmacoinformatic tool. These models enable the prediction of likely in vivo drug-drug in-teractions from in vitro data. In vivo drug-drug interaction data from the literature was also loaded into the software to validate the system and to give clinical guidance on specific drug-drug interactions. In this first phase of the project, focus was on medications used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, TB, malaria and other diseases common in Africa.

40|$|There {{is a need}} {{to develop}} quick, cheap, {{sensitive}} and specific methods to detect the carcinogenic potential of chemicals. Currently there is no in vitro model system for reliable detection of non-genotoxic carcinogens (NGTX) and current tests for detection of genotoxic carcinogens (GTX) can have low specificity. A transcriptomics approach holds promise and a few studies have utilised this technique. However, the majority of these studies have examined liver carcinogens with little work on renal carcinogens which may act via renal-specific NGTX mechanisms. In this study the normal rat renal cell line (NRK- 52 E) was exposed to sub-toxic concentrations of selected rat renal carcinogens and non-carcinogens (NC) for 6 h, 24 h and 72 h. Renal carcinogens were classified based on their presumed mode of action into GTX and NGTX classes. A whole-genome transcriptomics approach was used to determined genes and pathways as potential signatures for GTX, NGTX and those common to both carcinogenic events in vitro. For some of the GTX compounds an S 9 drug <b>metabolising</b> <b>system</b> was included to aid pro-carcinogen activation. Only three genes were commonly deregulated after carcinogen (GTX + NGTX) exposure, one Mdm 2 with a detection rate of 67 %, and p 21 and Cd 55 with a detection rate of 56 %. However, examination of enriched pathways showed that 3 out of 4 NGTX carcinogens and 4 out of 5 GTX carcinogens were related to known pathways involved in carcinogenesis giving a detection rate of 78 %. In contrast, none of the NC chemicals induced any of the above genes or well-established carcinogenic pathways. Additionally, five genes (Lingo 1, Hmox 1, Ssu 72, Lyrm and Usp 9 x) were commonly altered with 3 out of 4 NGTX carcinogens but not with NC or GTX carcinogens. However, there was no clear separation of GTX and NGTX carcinogens using pathway analysis with several pathways being common to both classes. The findings presented here indicate that the NRK- 52 E cell line has the potential to detect carcinogenic chemicals, although a much larger number of chemicals need to be used to confirm these findings...|$|E

Subsequent actions enable the operator to retrieve more information on the mechanism of interactions, the quantitative measure of the interaction, access to published abstracts on studies, and possible prescription options to minimise DDIs. The software currently has data for 50 drugs used in the design and focuses on the treatment of tropical diseases in addition to classical cases of drug-drug interactions involving other general classes of drugs. The tool can be distributed on Compaq Disk (CD) and be run on any Personal Computer (PC) on windows. We have successfully developed a pharmacokinetic- based tool with a potential to assist clinicians and pharmacists in detecting and rationalizing DDIs. The tool has proved very useful as a teaching tool on DDIs by using the more advanced functions that explore the performance of current drug-drug interactions prediction models. From the available literature, it is clear that more studies need to be done to establish the prevalence and mechanisms of DDIs in the treatment of infectious diseases. We are now adding more data, validating the tool and finally testing the acceptability of this tool among clinicians and pharmacists for routine use...|$|R
40|$|Drug {{metabolism}} is a specialised {{subset of}} xenobiotic metabolism, {{pertaining to the}} breakdown and elimination of pharmaceutical drugs. The enzymes involved in these pathways are the cytochrome P 450 family of isozymes. Metabolism {{is an important factor}} in determining the pharmacological effects of drugs. The main aim of this study was to develop a system whereby the major metabolites of drugs can be produced in vitro. An in vitro system was developed and optimised using commercially prepared microsomes from rat liver and coumarin (by monitoring its conversion to 7 -hydroxycoumarin) as a model. The optimum running conditions for the incubations were 50 μM coumarin, 50 μg protein/ml microsomes, 1 mM NADP⁺, 5 mM G 6 P and 1 U/ml G 6 PDH incubated for 30 minutes at 38 ℃. The HPLC method for the detection of coumarin and 7 -hydroxycoumarin was also validated with respect to linearity, reproducibility, precision, accuracy and lower limits of detection and quantification. The system developed was then tested using microsomes prepared from fresh bovine liver on these ten drugs of interest in doping control in horse racing: diazepam, nordiazepam, oxazepam, promazine, acepromazine, chlorpromazine, morphine, codeine, etoricoxib and lumiracoxib. The bovine liver microsomes were prepared using differential centrifugation and had activity on a par with the commercial preparations. This in vitro <b>system</b> <b>metabolised</b> the drugs and produced both phase I and II metabolites, similar to those observed in humans and horses in vivo. For example, the major metabolites of the benzodiazepine drug, diazepam, nordiazepam, temazepam and oxazepam as well as the glucuronidated phase II products were all found after incubations with the bovine liver microsomes. The metabolism of the drugs was also investigated in silico using the computational procedure, MetaSite. MetaSite was able to successfully predict known metabolites for most of the drugs studied. Differences were observed from the in vitro incubations and this is most likely due to MetaSite using only human cytochrome P 450 s for analysis...|$|R
40|$|Cruciferous {{vegetables}} and their bioactive constituents {{have been shown}} to inhibit chemically induced colon cancer (IARC, 2004). However, the results of epidemiological studies have been inconsistent (IARC, 2004). This may reflect a lack of sensitivity of such studies. One factor that is often overlooked by epidemiological studies is the effect of processing. Processing may alter the content of the bioactive compounds present in cruciferous vegetables or their bioavailability. Cruciferous vegetables contain numerous bioactive compounds, but their anticarcinogenic properties have been mainly attributed to their content of glucosinolates (GLS). The breakdown of GLS to their bioactive products is largely dependent on the plant enzyme myrosinase, whereas the profile of products formed, depends on the parent GLS, conditions of hydrolysis and the presence of a cofactor, epithiospecifier protein (ESP). Thermal processing may inactivate myrosinase and ESP thereby altering the location and extent of GLS breakdown within the GI tract and the profile of breakdown products formed. This may in turn, determine whether cruciferous vegetables exert beneficial or detrimental effects. A pig feeding trial was conducted to investigate the effect of blanch-freezing on the ability of broccoli (600 g/d; 12 d) to influence putative intermediary biomarkers of colon cancer, including DNA damage in colonocytes, the xenobiotic <b>metabolising</b> enzyme (XME) <b>system,</b> the colonic microflora and SCFA concentrations. The consumption of raw broccoli (cv. Marathon) caused a significant 27 % increase in DNA strand breakage (measured by the „comet assay‟) in colonocytes (P= 0. 025), whereas blanched-frozen broccoli had no significant effect. Both broccoli diets had no significant effect on XME or the concentration of SCFA, but they caused an increase in the ratio of lactobacilli to coliforms of borderline significance (P= 0. 065). A second trial was conducted to further investigate the effect of raw broccoli consumption. Pigs were fed a different cultivar of raw broccoli (cv. Monaco) or raw carrots (cv. Nairobi). Carrots were fed to explore whether a raw vegetable high in antioxidants but devoid of GLS would influence colonocyte DNA damage. Results were similar to the first experiment, raw broccoli caused a significant 54 % increase in DNA strand breakage (P< 0. 001), whereas raw carrots had no significant effect; both raw vegetables caused {{a significant increase in the}} ratio of lactobacilli to coliforms (P< 0. 001, broccoli; P= 0. 002, carrots), but had no effect on other measures. These studies appear to be the first to report that raw broccoli consumption causes an increase in DNA strand breakage in colonocytes. Collectively, they suggest that the consumption of high intakes of raw broccoli may not be advisable.

40|$|Effective {{treatment}} of metastatic tumours is hampered by poor distribution of small molecule chemotherapeutic drugs to distal sites of metastatic growth. This thesis {{has examined the}} potential for nano-sized drug carriers, and in particular dendritic polymers or dendrimers to enhance the exposure of chemotherapeutics to lymphatic and lung resident cancer metastases and to promote benefits in treatment efficacy against these hard-to-treat tumours. Initial studies compared the lymphatic distribution {{of a series of}} nanochemotherapeutics following subcutaneous (SC) administration. Conjugation of a model chemotherapeutic drug (doxorubicin; DOX) to a PEGylated dendrimer (12 nm diameter) resulted in the greatest exposure of DOX to the lymphatic system when compared to DOX encapsulated within a (~ 100 nm) PEGylated liposome, various selfassembled micellar (6 nm) systems or a control formulation of DOX in saline. The advantage provided by the dendrimer formulation appeared to reflect a combination of efficient interstitial convection and selective lymphatic absorption. Improved lymphatic exposure of a second chemotherapeutic, methotrexate (MTX), following conjugation to a PEGylated dendrimer scaffold was subsequently demonstrated and also shown to improve the {{treatment of}} lymph node metastases following IV and SC administration when compared to a solution formulation of MTX. In spite of improved lymphatic exposure, however, interaction of the carboxyl group in MTX with a putative receptor at the SC injection site significantly limited interstitial drainage of the MTX conjugated dendrimer. Subsequent studies revealed that this interaction could be reduced (and lymphatic drainage improved) by conjugation of MTX to the dendrimer with a linker of lower molecular weight, thereby withdrawing the MTX interaction site into the PEG corona of the dendrimer, and also by coadministration with macromolecules such as dextrans and albumin, that appear to block the interaction site. The second aspect of this thesis examined the potential for dendrimers to selectively target secondary cancers in the lung and the pulmonary lymphatic system following administration to the lungs. Initial studies revealed that the degree of dendrimer PEGylation significantly influenced lung residence time, dendrimer absorption and in vivo dendrimer stability following administration to the lungs. Dendrimers with a layer of surface conjugated PEG of relatively low molecular weight (200 Da) were more efficiently absorbed from the lungs, but were also highly <b>metabolised.</b> In comparison <b>systems</b> derived with higher molecular weight PEG (570 Da+) were retained for longer and were more stable, but were less readily absorbed. Drug conjugation to the larger PEGylated dendrimer was subsequently shown to reduce pulmonary toxicity and to enhance the treatment of lung-resident metastases after instillation to the lungs of rats when compared to IV or pulmonary administration of a DOX solution. Surprisingly, the contribution of the pulmonary lymphatic system to dendrimer absorption from the lung was minimal, presumably reflecting limited access to pulmonary lymphatics as these are largely absent from alveoli. In summary, this thesis describes the use of PEGylated dendrimers as a vehicle to promote the exposure of chemotherapeutics to the lymphatic system, highlights the potential of this approach to improve the treatment of lymph node resident tumours and provides proof of concept data to support the use of dendrimer-based drug delivery systems to provide improved treatment options for lung resident tumours.
