40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to establish the clinico-pathological features and response totreatment in primary ileocaecal lymphomas. Fifteen patients with primary ileocaecal lymphomawere analyzed with respect to clinical presentation, histopathological aspects and response to varioustreatment modalities. Abdominal pain and a palpable abdominal mass were the commonest presentingfeatures. Ten (66. 66 %) patients had clinical stage liE disease, four (26. 66 %) had stage IE, and onepatient (6. 66 %) had stage IV disease. <b>Malignant</b> <b>lymphoma</b> small lymphocytic (MLSL) was presentin 40 % of patients followed by <b>malignant</b> <b>lymphoma</b> diffuse large cell (MLDLC) in 26. 26 % andmalignant lymphoma diffuse small cleaved cell (MLDSC) in 20 % ofpatients. <b>Malignant</b> lymphomadiffuse <b>mixed</b> (MLDM) and <b>malignant</b> <b>lymphoma</b> lymphoblastic (MLL) was present in 6. 66 % ofpatients in each. All the patients underwent laparotomy with 14 undergoing surgical resection whichincluded resection of terminal ileum. In one patient only, a biopsy was taken. Combinationchemotherapy (CCT), 4 to 6 cycles ofCHOP/CVP was used in all the patients. Three patients withpersistent residual disease after surgery and CCT were treated with 35 Grays (Gy) ofexternal beamradiotherapy on a tele-cobalt unit at 80 cms ofsource to skin distance. Eleven (73 %) patients remaineddisease free at 10 months to 14 years from the start of treatment. The survival trends indicate apoorer outcome for more advanced cl inical stage. A well designed prospective and randomized trialbased on a large number of patients is essential to work out an optimal management policy inprimary ileocaecal lymphoma...|$|R
40|$|The {{etiology}} of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) remains a controversial matter, but, {{in the last}} few years, considerable evidence suggests that aberrations of the immune system and viruses may act as etiologic agents, in at least some cases of NHL. In fact, patients with primary immuno-deficiencies, or those suffering from diseases characterized by autoimmune dysfunction, show an increased risk for the development of NHL. Several viruses have been identified as possible etiologic agents for NHL; one of the best studied is the Epstein-Barr virus, which was detected in cultures of tumor cells from patients with Burkitt's lymphoma. The pathogenetic potential of this virus is illustrated by its association with an increasing number of malignant diseases. In addition, the human T-cell lymphotropic virus family (HTLV), was also recognized as possible etiologic agents for several lymphomas, such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and T-cell leukemia-lymphoma syndrome (HTLV-I), and T-cell hairy cell leukemia (HTLV-II). Recently, the presence of hepatitis C virus infection has also been recognized in several hematological malignancies such as <b>mixed</b> cryoglobulinemia, low-grade <b>malignant</b> <b>lymphomas</b> and Waldenström's disease. The possible etiopathogenetic role of this virus in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas is discussed on the basis of molecular, clinical, and epidemiological considerations...|$|R

40|$|AIMS: To {{investigate}} whether nested {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) and immunohistochemistry {{can be used to}} diagnose <b>malignant</b> <b>lymphoma.</b> METHODS: Paraffin wax embedded tissue sections from 31 patients with <b>malignant</b> <b>lymphoma</b> were analysed by nested PCR and immunohistochemistry using standard protocols. RESULTS: Nested PCR amplification of 1 pg DNA confirmed monoclonality in B cell lymphoma; PCR amplification of 10 pg DNA confirmed monoclonality in T cell lymphoma. Twenty seven (87 %) samples were diagnosed as <b>malignant</b> <b>lymphoma</b> by nested PCR, and 24 (77 %) by immunohistochemistry. Seven samples were diagnosed as <b>malignant</b> <b>lymphoma</b> by nested PCR, but not by immunohistochemistry, whereas the use of both procedures gave a diagnosis of <b>malignant</b> <b>lymphoma</b> in all 31 samples. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of immunohistochemistry and nested PCR can be used to diagnose <b>malignant</b> <b>lymphoma</b> in routine paraffin wax embedded sections...|$|R

40|$|Because <b>{{malignant}}</b> <b>lymphoma,</b> {{the second}} most common malignant tumor of the head and neck, and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), the most common malignant tumor of the head and neck, require different treatments, {{it is important to be}} able to differentiate them. In the present study, we attempted to differentiate <b>malignant</b> <b>lymphomas</b> from SCCs using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI). Seventeen lesions (in 8 cases) of <b>malignant</b> <b>lymphoma</b> and 30 cases of SCC were compared by DCE-MRI. Thirteen of 17 <b>malignant</b> <b>lymphomas</b> (76. 5 %) showed the maximum contrast index (CI) at 90 – 180 s, while 26 of 30 SCCs (86. 7 %) showed the maximum CI at a much faster 60 – 105 s. There was a statistically significant difference between SCC and <b>malignant</b> <b>lymphoma</b> in the time needed reach the maximum CI (p= 0. 0177). There was also significant difference between SCC and <b>malignant</b> <b>lymphoma</b> in their maximum CIs (p&# 60; 0. 001), with the maximum CIs of 29 / 30 SCCs (96. 7 %) above 2. 0, while 12 / 17 <b>malignant</b> <b>lymphomas</b> (70. 6 %) showed CIs of less than 2. 0.

40|$|A high {{prevalence}} of <b>malignant</b> <b>lymphoma</b> among patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been reported. The {{aim of this}} retrospective {{study was to determine}} the incidence of <b>malignant</b> <b>lymphoma</b> and the relationship between <b>malignant</b> <b>lymphoma</b> and viral elimination in patients with HCV. Method We studied 501 consecutive HCV-infected patients who had never received interferon therapy and 2708 consecutive HCV-infected patients who received interferon therapy. Results In the non-interferon group, the cumulative rates of <b>malignant</b> <b>lymphoma</b> development were 0. 6 % at the 5 th year, 2. 3 % at the 10 th year, and 2. 6 % at the 15 th year. The cumulative rates of <b>malignant</b> <b>lymphoma</b> development in interferon-treated patients with sustained virologic response were 0 % at the 5 th year, 0 % at the 10 th year, and 0 % at the 15 th year. The cumulative rates of <b>malignant</b> <b>lymphoma</b> development with persistent infection were 0. 4 % at the 5 th year, 1. 5 % at the 10 th year, and 2. 6 % at the 15 th year. The <b>malignant</b> <b>lymphoma</b> development rate was higher in patients with persistent infection than in patients with sustained virologic response (P= 3 D. 0159). The hazard ratio of lymphomagenesis in 1048 patients with sustained virologic response was significantly lower than in patients with persistent infection (hazard ratio: 0. 13; P= 3 D. 049). Conclusion Our retrospective study is the first to determine the annual incidence of <b>malignant</b> <b>lymphoma</b> among patients with HCV at 0. 23 %. Our results indicate that sustained virologic response induced by interferon therapy protects against the development of <b>malignant</b> <b>lymphoma</b> in patients with chronic HCV...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{relatively}} small number of cases of primary <b>malignant</b> <b>lymphoma</b> of the uterine corpus have been reported, and it is rare for cases to be preoperatively diagnosed by cytology. CASE: A 59 -year-old female experienced abnormal uterine bleeding of two months' duration. Preoperative evaluation of endometrial cytology revealed malignant cells. These cells demonstrated a rather round or oval configuration, with a markedly increased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, and were isolated and scattered in an inflammatory background. The nuclei were round or oval, and macronucleoli were marked. The cytologic diagnosis was <b>malignant</b> <b>lymphoma.</b> Postoperative histologic evaluation verified the presence of a primary <b>malignant</b> <b>lymphoma</b> in the uterine corpus, with a B-cell phenotype.
