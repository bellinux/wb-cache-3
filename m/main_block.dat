5|$|Since the prison's closure, six {{cells have}} been {{restored}} {{to represent the}} varying living conditions at different times in the prison's history. The <b>main</b> <b>block</b> also houses the gallows, solitary confinement cells, and two chapels.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan for}} Prior Park was to {{construct}} five buildings along three {{sides of a}} dodecagon matching the sweep {{of the head of}} the valley, with the main building being flanked by elongated wings based on designs by Andrea Palladio. The plans were influenced by drawings in Vitruvius Britannicus originally made by Colen Campbell for Wanstead House in Essex, which was yet to be built. The <b>main</b> <b>block</b> had 15 bays and each of the wings 17 bays each. Between each wing and the <b>main</b> <b>block</b> was a Porte-cochère for coaches to stop under. In addition to the stone from the local quarries, material, including the grand staircase and plasterwork, from the demolished Hunstrete House were used in the construction.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} RAM 14000 is almost complete, {{with the left}} side only lacking {{a piece of the}} maxilla. However, the skull was split down the middle by erosion, {{possibly}} when it was resting on the bottom of a river bed. The two sides are displaced slightly, with some bones of the right being moved off the <b>main</b> <b>block,</b> also by erosion. After reconstruction, the skull viewed from the side resembles other juvenile lambeosaurines found, being roughly a trapezoid in shape.|$|E

5|$|Within {{a year of}} the enquiry, almost 100 cells {{had been}} {{enlarged}} by knocking down the inner wall between two cells, and a classification system was introduced. Internal walls were constructed in the <b>main</b> <b>block,</b> creating four separate divisions. Following the urgings of the prison Superintendent George and various official enquiries, new workshops were built to provide increased useful employment for prisoners. Five spaces were designed for tailors, bookbinders, shoemakers, mat makers and painters.|$|E
5|$|The Fifth Ward Wardroom is a {{historic}} meeting hall at 47 Mulberry Street in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. It is a single-story red brick building, with a low-pitch hipped roof. Basically rectangular, an enclosed entry pavilion projects from the <b>main</b> <b>block.</b> The building was designed by William R. Walker & Son and built in 1886. Originally used as a polling place and meeting hall, it was later used as a school and by veterans organizations before being converted into a single family residence during its National Register of Historic Places nomination. It was listed on the historic register in 1983.|$|E
5|$|The First Ward Wardroom is a {{historic}} meeting hall at 171 Fountain Street in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. It is a single-story red brick building, with a low-pitch gable-over-hipped roof. Basically rectangular, an enclosed entry pavilion projects from the <b>main</b> <b>block.</b> The building, designed by William R. Walker & Son and built in 1886, {{is one of only}} three ward halls (structures built by the city and used as polling places and meeting halls) to survive in the state. Since about 1920 it has been the Major Walter G. Gatchell Post No. 306 of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E
50|$|The three <b>main</b> <b>blocks</b> of {{the project}} are the Grid, the WEB2 and the {{connections}} between the two technologies.|$|R
50|$|The {{school is}} large {{compared}} to other secondary schools in the UK. It has three <b>main</b> <b>blocks,</b> two demountable blocks and an additional block.|$|R

5|$|The Home {{opened its}} doors in 1923. It was built as a diocesan {{memorial}} to the Coloured men who paid the ultimate sacrifice for their country. It was run by the Anglican Nuns, the Order of St Margaret, East Grinstead who remained in charge until 1978 when they left South Africa in protest against apartheid. The <b>Main</b> <b>Block,</b> Boys' House and Priests' House were designed by the diocesan architect F.L.H. Flemming. The Church successfully opposed removal of the Home because the property was on farm land and {{not part of a}} proclaimed township.|$|E
5|$|The Main Cell Block is {{the longest}} and tallest cell range in Australia, and a {{dominating}} feature of the prison. New Division, constructed between 1904 and 1907, continues the façade alignment of the <b>main</b> <b>block.</b> Service buildings were converted into the separate Women's Prison. Fremantle Prison is surrounded by limestone perimeter walls, while a two storey limestone gatehouse, with a central clock, presents an imposing entrance. North {{and south of the}} gatehouse, on The Terrace, are several cottages and houses – three of which are built in Victorian style in contrast to the Georgian style of the others.|$|E
5|$|The ancient cathedral {{was modeled}} on the Assumption Cathedral of the Kiev Monastery of the Caves. It used the Greek cross plan {{prevalent}} {{during the time of}} the Kievan Rus, six pillars, and three apses. A miniature church, likely a baptistery, adjoined the cathedral from the south. There was also a tower with a staircase leading to the choir loft; it was incorporated into the northern part of the narthex rather than protruding from the <b>main</b> <b>block</b> as was common at the time. It is likely that the cathedral had a single dome, although two smaller domes might have topped the tower and baptistery. The interior decoration was lavish as its high-quality shimmering mosaics, probably the finest in Kievan Rus, still testify.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>main</b> <b>blocks</b> {{there is also the}} tennis courts, two playing fields and a redgra adjacent to F Block and C Block.|$|R
50|$|The {{rectangular}} one-story {{brick building}} rises from a granite foundation to a hipped roof covered with slate tiles and a decorative ridge cap. The <b>main</b> <b>block's</b> fenestration consists of double-mullioned semicircular windows.|$|R
50|$|IGPTC {{campus is}} off the Mahe-Palloor main road. The campus houses two <b>main</b> <b>blocks</b> {{connected}} by a skywalk. The campus is completely WiFi enabled.IGPTC Mahe provides facilities such as science laboratories and system labs.|$|R
5|$|The castle's {{original}} appearance {{differed significantly}} {{from that of}} today. The arrow-shaped Water Bastion facing into the Medway and the <b>main</b> <b>block</b> behind it {{were part of the}} original design. There were also towers {{at either end of the}} water frontage, though these were subsequently replaced by towers of a different design. The gatehouse and moat were later additions. A number of derelict buildings in Rochester Castle, Aylesford, and Bopley were pulled down to provide stone for the castle. The main structure had been completed by 1564, but it took another three years and an infusion of extra funds to finish the project. The total cost came to £4,349.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} {{constructed}} by Charles Payne, an engraver {{who founded the}} firm of Payne & Taylor for calico printers in 1849. In 1849, Payne becan to purchase parcels of land that he would later construct the house on. The <b>main</b> <b>block</b> {{of the house was}} erected in 1855–1856 and later expanded with a north wing in the mid-1870s. The final major addition was an ell {{on the west side of}} the house, the date of construction occurred prior to 1902. Though the house has been the subject of some alterations, these changes are largely inconspicuous.|$|E
5|$|The {{palace of}} Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, south east of Paris, was another of Catherine's {{unfinished}} projects. She bought this building, on which Philibert de l'Orme had worked, from the heirs of Cardinal Jean du Bellay, after the latter's death in 1560. She then commissioned de l'Orme {{to finish the}} work he had begun there. Drawings by Jacques Androuet du Cerceau in the British Museum may shed light on Catherine's intentions for Saint-Maur. They show a plan to enlarge each wing by doubling {{the size of the}} pavilions next to the <b>main</b> <b>block</b> of the house. The house was to stay as one storey, with a flat roof and rusticated pilasters. That meant the extensions would not unbalance the masses of the building as seen from the side.|$|E
50|$|Being {{one of the}} <b>main</b> <b>blocks</b> of the district, {{the block}} office is Puranattukara, Thrissur. As major revenue and {{business}} block and a residential area of Thrissur city in Kerala state, it is mostly either industrial and agricultural.|$|R
5000|$|The code {{covering}} the Moroccan nationality was issued in 1958, {{two years after}} the end of the French protectorate over Morocco. The code has seven chapters and 46 articles. The <b>main</b> <b>blocks</b> of the code are the following: ...|$|R
5000|$|...a (--all-blocks): Write {{individual}} execution {{counts for}} every basic block. Normally gcov outputs execution counts {{only for the}} <b>main</b> <b>blocks</b> of a line. With this option you can determine if blocks within a single line are not being executed.|$|R
5|$|Designed by William R. Walker & Son and {{constructed}} by S. Mason & H. A. Smith in 1886, the one story red brick Queen Anne style building is basically rectangular with a low-pitched hipped roof. The red bricks are laid in dark red mortar and is contrasted by the granite sill course and brownstone belt course at window sill level. The building has a central closed entry pavilion which projects out {{and has two}} porches oriented to face Mulberry and Cedar Street. The building has three lunette windows {{on the sides of}} the <b>main</b> <b>block,</b> each divided into thirds, and a smaller windows on the pavilion's pedimented end. The rear ell has double hung two-over-two sash windows. At the time of the nomination, during the renovations to a single family home, the house had its Cedar Street porch closed in with plywood and the smaller lunette windows were boarded in, but the exterior wooden trim was largely extant.|$|E
5|$|Fremantle Prison's New Division was {{constructed}} between 1904 and 1907, {{as a response}} to overcrowding. The division continues the façade alignment of the <b>main</b> <b>block.</b> The building, L shaped in plan, is three storeys high of regular coursed pale ashlar limestone blocks with rock-face. Openings are set in brick and freestone and it has a handsome lantern range above the main atrium. The building is visually significant as it complements the main cell block and completes the northern zone of the prison. The interior configuration and cells are significant as an example of an attempt to introduce the separate system to Western Australia, whereby prisoners were completely isolated for {{the first three months of}} their sentence. The division's exercise yard initially used a panopticon to facilitate this concept during the prisoners' hour of exercise each day. The system was not successful, and considered a dated prisoner management strategy, leading its removal within five years.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Fremantle Prison, a former Australian prison in Fremantle, Western Australia, extends from its {{construction}} as a prison for convicts, using convict labour, in the 1850s, through to its modern-day usage {{as a tourist}} attraction. The design for Fremantle Prison {{was based on the}} Pentonville Prison in Britain, and it would be the longest, tallest prison cell block in the southern hemisphere. Construction began in 1851, and was completed by the end of 1859. The prison was transferred to the colonial government in 1886 for use for locally sentenced prisoners. Following a Royal Commission held in 1898−99, some changes were made to Fremantle Prison, including knocking down the inner wall between two cells, introducing a prisoner classification system, and constructing internal walls in the <b>main</b> <b>block</b> to create four separate divisions. A new cell block, New Division, was completed in 1907 and occupied in 1908.|$|E
50|$|The {{house itself}} shows Downing's {{influence}} in the irregularity and asymmetry of its three <b>main</b> <b>blocks.</b> The varied rooflines, truncated and cross gables, large veranda and chimneys decorated with medieval crosses are also found in many of Downing's patterns.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the Summer Term 2007, two of the school's four <b>main</b> <b>blocks,</b> A Block and C block, {{were cleared}} and sealed off ready for {{refurbishment}} work that took place from September 2007 to the middle of 2009.|$|R
2500|$|There are two <b>main</b> <b>blocks</b> of Greek {{characters}} in Unicode. The first is [...] "Greek and Coptic" [...] (U+0370 to U+03FF). This block {{is based on}} ISO 8859-7 and is sufficient to write Modern Greek. There are also some archaic letters and Greek-based technical symbols.|$|R
5|$|The Charles Payne House is a -story Gothic-Italianate vernacular cottage {{that has}} a spacious garden founded {{on the site of}} a long-removed house. The house's gable end faces the street with a rear ell and the other ell {{perpendicular}} to the <b>main</b> <b>block</b> on the west side. Centered on the east end of the roof is a cross gable which is visually offset by the dormer on the west. The house has a small gable-roofed vestibule on the east side, aligned underneath the cross-gable. The rear ell has an attached porch that spans its length. A single story bay hexagonal bay window protrudes from the facade. The distinguishing feature of the Payne house is the wood trim exterior, consisting of hood mould on the paired windows on the south, four kinds of bargeboards and bracketed cornices on the rear ell's east side. The interior of the Charles Payne House is not covered in detail by any survey, but has three mantelpieces on the first floor, two displaying Gothic Revival influence in their wooden designs and the third, located in the rear ell, made of grey marble with a round-head opening. Though not mentioned in the nomination, a photo shows one of the wooden mantlepieces filled with brick and rendered unusable at the time. The setting of the house was important to the National Register nomination, which specifically highlighted its shaded garden and fencing. At the time of the nomination, an ornamental round head picket fence surrounded the property and access was through a double-leaf lattice work gate. By 2013, the picket fence and entrance gate had been removed, but the property still retains the street frontage for its garden.|$|E
25|$|Structural {{problems}} {{began to}} manifest themselves {{even before the}} first building was completed, and in 1887, only {{three years after the}} opening of the <b>main</b> <b>block,</b> a major landslide occurred - predicted as a risk by the surveyors - and affected a temporary building. The <b>main</b> <b>block</b> survived until 1959, when it was demolished because of further earth movement.|$|E
25|$|The two casemates flank the <b>main</b> <b>block</b> a {{few hundred}} meters to either side. A project to link the casemates to the central block was never started.|$|E
50|$|The design {{comprised}} three <b>main</b> <b>blocks.</b> Each {{of these}} in turn had L shaped dormitories with ablutions placed centrally in an inner quadrangle with 2 padded cells in B block.There was also a spacious dining room and laundry which had a further half acre of washing line.|$|R
50|$|Three <b>main</b> <b>blocks</b> are {{dedicated}} to classrooms, laboratories, staff's room, the library, the general office, the Muslim prayer room and toilets. A canteen with a dining area and a separate teachers' lounge are located closest to the main gates. A horticulture shed stands near a two-storey computer lab.|$|R
40|$|The {{authors of}} the article on {{the example of a}} {{particular}} crossing suggest a description of a new project of adaptive control system of railway crossings work selecting for the adaptive system the most suitable adaptive control algorithm defining its <b>main</b> <b>blocks,</b> their functions, and operation algorithms. At the beginning of the paper the essence of complex objects control adaptation is analysed, and the most optimal one is selected from them. Then the <b>main</b> <b>blocks</b> of the suggested system and their operation are described applying the selected adaptive functioning algorithm. The paper is completed with the comparison of the effectiveness of the suggested system with the present one, proving that the suggested system can significantly compete and solve the problems with traffic in the movement of railway and city transport...|$|R
