5|$|I Airborne Corps {{became part}} of the First Allied Airborne Army, {{commanded}} by Lieutenant General Lewis H. Brereton, in August 1944. While retaining command of the corps, Browning also became Deputy Commander of the Army, despite a poor relationship with Brereton and being disliked by many American officers, including Major General Ridgway, now commanding the newly created U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps, in turn handing over the 82nd Airborne Division to Brigadier General Gavin. During preparations for one of many cancelled operations, Linnete II, his disagreement with Brereton over a risky operation caused him to threaten resignation, which, due to differences in <b>military</b> <b>culture,</b> Brereton regarded as tantamount to disobeying an order. Browning was forced into a humiliating backdown.|$|E
5|$|Australia's {{working class}} culture also {{influenced}} {{that of the}} AIF. Approximately three-quarters of AIF volunteers {{were members of the}} working class, with a high proportion also being trade unionists, and soldiers frequently applied their attitudes to industrial relations to the Army. Throughout the war there were incidents where soldiers refused to undertake tasks that they considered demeaning or protested against actual or perceived mistreatment by their officers. These actions were similar to the strikes many soldiers had taken part in during their pre-enlistment employment, with the men not seeing themselves as mutineers. The protests which occurred in 1918 over the planned disbandment of several battalions also used similar tactics to those employed in industrial disputes. Historian Nathan Wise has judged that the frequent use of industrial action in the AIF led to improved conditions for the soldiers, and contributed to it having a less strict <b>military</b> <b>culture</b> than was common in the British Army.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} towards Christianity {{began again}} in the late 6th and 7th centuries, helped by {{the conversion of the}} Franks in Northern France, who carried considerable influence in England. Pope Gregory I sent a team of missionaries to convert King Æthelberht of Kent and his household, starting the process of converting Kent. Augustine became the first Archbishop of Canterbury and started to build new churches across the South-East, reusing existing pagan shrines. Oswald and Oswiu, kings of Northumbria, were converted in the 630s and 640s, and the wave of change carried on through the middle of the 7th century across the kingdoms of Mercia, the South Saxons and the Isle of Wight. The process was largely complete {{by the end of the}} 7th century, but left a confusing and disparate array of local practices and religious ceremonies. This new Christianity reflected the existing <b>military</b> <b>culture</b> of the Anglo-Saxons: as kings began to convert in the 6th and 7th centuries, conversion began to be used as a justification for war against the remaining pagan kingdoms, for example, while Christian saints were imbued with martial properties.|$|E

5|$|Following the war, Graham {{served in}} various staff {{positions}} in Eastern Command based in New South Wales, and in 1946 he was posted to Japan on the Headquarters of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. Promoted to lieutenant {{colonel in the}} Interim Army, he later briefly commanded the 2nd Battalion, Australian Regiment (2 AR) between 23 November 1948 and 10 January 1949. In 1949 Graham was again attached to Headquarters Eastern Command, before subsequently being posted as a tactics instructor to RMC during 1950–51. He later completed further training in the United Kingdom and Germany in 1952. Considered one of Australia's foremost tank experts, Graham commanded the 1st Armoured Regiment during 1952–53. He subsequently served as commandant of the Armoured School between 1953 and 1956, and filled the position of Director of Armour during the same period. He later wrote an influential paper on the successful use of armour in jungle warfare {{and its ability to}} reduce casualties among the infantry. Graham attended the United States Armed Forces Staff College and subsequently filled the role of Assistant Military Attaché in Washington, D.C. as an intelligence officer in 1957–58. His exposure to US <b>military</b> <b>culture</b> and intelligence during this period affected his own military thinking and would be influential during his later service. Graham was subsequently posted to Army Headquarters in Canberra in the Directorate of Military Operations and Plans in 1959.|$|E

25|$|There was a {{high degree}} of professionalism in the army of the Oyo Empire. Its {{military}} success was {{due in large part to}} its cavalry as well as the leadership and courage of Oyo officers and warriors. Because its main geographic focus was north of the forest, Oyo enjoyed easier farming and thus a steady growth in population. This contributed to Oyo's ability to consistently field a large force. There was also an entrenched <b>military</b> <b>culture</b> in Oyo where victory was obligatory and defeat carried the duty of committing suicide. This do-or-die policy no doubt contributed to the military aggressiveness of Oyo's generals.|$|E
25|$|The {{size of the}} U.S. {{military}} {{in the latter half}} of the twentieth century, unprecedented in peacetime, caused concern in some circles, primarily as to the potential effect of maintaining such a large force in a democratic society. Some predicted disaster and were concerned with the growing militarization of American society. These writers were quite sure that a distinctly <b>military</b> <b>culture</b> was inherently dangerous to a non-militaristic liberal society. Others warned that the ascendancy of the military establishment would fundamentally change American foreign policy and would weaken the intellectual fabric of the country. However, most of the arguments were less apocalyptic and settled along two tracks. The two tracks are highlighted, respectively, by Samuel P. Huntington's Soldier and the State and Morris Janowitz's The Professional Soldier.|$|E
25|$|The {{studies that}} {{conclude}} abuse {{is a bigger}} problem in military families than civilian families attribute this to the long hours, frequent disruptions in lifestyles, and high degree of stress.

Other studies, however, argue that military families have a smaller problem than civilian families because <b>military</b> <b>culture</b> offers more accessible help for victims of abuse. Military families have health care, housing, and family support programs often unavailable to lower income civilian families. Abusive family members {{are more likely to be}} ordered (by their commanding officer or base commander) to obtain treatment, thus reducing reoccurrences of abuse.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, Zimbardo {{began working}} with Sarah Brunskill and Anthony Ferreras on a new theory called the social {{intensity}} syndrome (SIS). SIS is a new term coined to describe and normalize the effects <b>military</b> <b>culture</b> has on the socialization of both active soldiers and veterans. Zimbardo and Brunskill presented the new theory and a preliminary factor analysis of it accompanying survey at the Western Psychological Association in 2013. Brunskill finished the data collection in December 2013. Through an exploratory component factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency and validity tests demonstrated that SIS was a reliable and valid construct of measuring military socialization. Fifty-eight items were deemed viable and six factors were identified; military friends (16 items), family (11 items), gender social preference (7 items), social bonding (11 items), nostalgia (9 items) and drug use (4 items). Identifying and standardizing SIS was the first step, further research has identified that 4 demographic categories within the military; active and have been deployed (AD), active and never been deployed (AND), inactive and have been deployed (ID) and inactive and never been deployed (IND). These are important categories to better understand how service members are affected leaving the military.|$|E
25|$|Janowitz {{agreed with}} Huntington that, {{because of the}} {{fundamental}} differences between the civilian and military worlds, clashes would develop which would diminish the goal of civilian control of the military. His answer was to ensure that convergence occurred, thus ensuring that the military world would be imbued with the norms and expectations of the society that created it. He encouraged use of conscription, which would bring {{a wide variety of}} individuals into the military. He also encouraged the use of more Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) programs at colleges and universities to ensure that the military academies did not have a monopoly on the type of officer, particularly the senior general officer and flag officer leadership positions, in the military services. He specifically encouraged the development of ROTC programs in the more elite universities, so that the broader influences of society would be represented by the officer corps. The more such societal influences present within the <b>military</b> <b>culture,</b> the smaller the attitudinal differences between the two worlds and the greater the chance of civilians maintaining control over the military. Janowitz, like Huntington, believed that the civilian and military worlds were different from one another; while Huntington developed a theory to control the difference, Janowitz developed a theory to diminish the difference.|$|E
