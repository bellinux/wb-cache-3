5000|$|Created as {{a refined}} luxury engine with {{improved}} {{power over the}} EA82T, Subaru introduced the ER series engine in 1988 exclusively to be featured in the Subaru Alcyone VX. Like the EA series engines, the ER series engine featured 2-valve cylinder heads with hydraulic lash adjusters and the block shared the same bore and stroke. While recognised as bearing many similarities to the Subaru EA82 engine, there are numerous differences in design between the two engines and {{a large portion of}} parts are unique to the ER27. The oil and water pumps are unique to the ER27, sharing similar bolt patterns and design to the EA82, but being of a higher flow in both cases.The intake manifold uses a two piece design with a lower section bolting to the heads containing the coolant bridge, injectors and various vacuum lines. The upper intake manifold then bolts to the lower section and is unlike the EA82 or EJ22 [...] "spider" [...] manifold designs in that there is no central plenum chamber. The valve timing system is belt-drive using two individual timing belts, curiously one belt uses a spring tensioner (like the EA82) whilst the other uses a hydraulic tensioner (like the EJ22). Both JDM and USDM versions of the ER27 used <b>multi-point</b> <b>electronic</b> fuel <b>injection.</b> The ER27 designation was the first time Subaru incorporated the engine's displacement into the series name and all future engines have retained this nomenclature.|$|R
5000|$|In 1991 GMC {{introduced}} the GMC Syclone limited edition truck that used a turbocharged 4.3L V6. This engine used a Mitsubishi TD06-17C turbocharger, Garrett Water/Air intercooler and <b>electronic</b> <b>multi-point</b> fuel <b>injection.</b> Although GM made these {{modifications to the}} engine, it was still referred to with the RPO LB4 code. The majority of the naturally aspirated LB4's long-block was shared with the turbo version. However, the vehicles that used the 4.3L turbo engine also included RPO code ZR9. Internal engine upgrades included nodular iron main bearing caps, graphite composite head gaskets with stainless steel flanges and hypereutectic pistons which lowered the engine compression to 8.35:1. [...] A unique intake manifold that used the 48 mm twin-bore throttle body from the 5.7L TPI Corvette engine was used on the engine's top end.|$|R
2500|$|Further {{detail of}} the engine {{includes}} fully sequential <b>electronic</b> <b>multi-point</b> fuel <b>injection</b> with intake manifold-sited fuel injectors, mapped direct ignition system with solid-state high voltage distribution using eight individual single-spark ignition coils and NGK longlife spark plugs, and three knock sensors. [...] Engine management uses a Bosch Motronic ME7.1.1 engine control unit, which controls all functions of the engine operation; including fuel delivery, ignition system, valve timing, emissions control systems, and torque reduction control—the latter operating {{in conjunction with the}} Bosch ESP5.7 Electronic Stability Programme, as part of the [...] "Anti Slip Regulation" [...] (ASR) traction control system. [...] The engine is compliant with the European Union Euro3 (EU3) standard, and includes two close-coupled primary catalytic converters (CATs), two underfloor main CATs, and four heated oxygen sensors which manage the cylinder bank selective lambda control. [...] This results in a CO2 emissions rating of 350g/km for the Avant and saloon in standard configuration.|$|R
2500|$|The G60 is a 1.8-litre {{internal}} combustion engine, which displaces [...] from a cylinder bore of , and a piston stroke of [...] [...] Its cylinder block is constructed from grey cast iron, and its cylinder head is cast aluminium alloy, with additional post-production heat treatment. [...] The crankcase contains a forged steel crankshaft which runs in five main bearings, and cast pistons with increased size gudgeon pins. [...] It has two valves per cylinder (eight valves in total), which are {{operated by a}} toothed belt-driven forged steel single overhead camshaft (SOHC) via hydraulic valve lifters, with the valves being closed by two concentric valve springs. [...] Charged air is cooled via an intercooler, and the operation {{and control of the}} engine is managed by a Bosch Digifant engine control unit, which includes common rail <b>electronic</b> <b>multi-point</b> fuel <b>injection</b> and a knock sensor. [...] It produced a maximum rated motive power output of [...] at 5,800revolutions per minute (rpm), and could generate a turning force torque of [...] at 4,000rpm.|$|R

For a further experimental study, the author transforms a X 6170 ZC- 19 diesel engine to a hybrid-fuel engine by installing this <b>electronic</b> <b>injection</b> system, and the load characteristics experiment of which testifies that: the diesel-LNG diesel engine can accurately measure the natural gas consumption and can thus control fuel consumption; it also possesses high replacement ratio. In addition, comparing to pure diesel engine, the hybrid-fuel engine has lower fuel consumption and thermal load, and a better performance in environment protection...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{is presented to}} get the number of comparison for torque, power, and specific fuel consumption between conventional engine (carburetor) system and <b>electronic</b> fuel <b>injection</b> (EFI) engine system. The method that used to get the data is by using the experiment method. The {{research is}} begun by preparing tools and materials those {{will be used for}} making test bed. After that is assembling the system on the engine alternately after getting the data including voltage, current, engine rotation (rpm), and fuel consumption (ml). Based on the experiment and parameter those have been experimented, the engine performance on the conventional system is lower at the high engine rotation than <b>electronic</b> fuel <b>injection</b> system, and when the engine rotation is low, the engine performance of the conventional system is higher than <b>electronic</b> fuel <b>injection</b> system, and the specific fuel consumption on the conventional engine system at high engine rotation is more wastefully than <b>electronic</b> fuel <b>injection</b> system, but at low engine rotation, the conventional engine system is more economical than <b>electronic</b> fuel <b>injection</b> system...|$|R
