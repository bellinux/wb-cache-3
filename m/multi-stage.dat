40|$|Abstract—As {{a program}} written in <b>multi-staged</b> {{language}} can generate and execute code fragments in excution time, {{it is hard}} to predict how many code fragments will be generated in execution time. Therefore, current test coverages are not likely to give right answers when they are apply to a program written in <b>multi-staged</b> language because the program size could not be estimated easily. In this paper, we present static analysis which detects interpretation and prove the correctness of analyzer. Moreover we propose new test coverage for <b>multi-staged</b> language using the result of analysis.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} type and effect {{system for a}} <b>multi-staged</b> {{language}} with exceptions. The proposed type and effect system checks if we safely synthesize complex controls with exceptions in <b>multi-staged</b> programming. The proposed exception constructs in <b>multi-staged</b> programming has no artificial restriction. Exception-raise and-handle expressions can appear in expressions of any stage, though they are executed only at stage 0. Exceptions can be raised during code composition and may escape before they are handled. Our effect type system support such features. We prove our type and effect system sound: empty effect means the input program has no uncaught exceptions during its execution. ...|$|R

Beyond the very large numbers involved in playing these sports, they are notable for being a major source of entertainment for many millions of non-players worldwide.

After discovering that the Bentusi have given aid to the exiles, the Taiidan attempt to destroy them, but are stopped by the Kushan fleet. The Bentusi then reveal that the Kushan had once ruled their own empire, before being destroyed by the Taiidan and exiled from Hiigara.

5|$|During the {{regrowth}} of {{pine trees}} after disturbance like clearcutting or wildfire, there appears an orderly sequence of mycorrhizal fungi as one species {{is replaced by}} another. A study on the ecological succession of ectomycorrhizal fungi in Canadian jack pine forests following wildfire concluded that S.brevipes is a <b>multi-stage</b> fungus. It appears relatively early during tree development; fruit bodies were common in 6-year-old tree stands, and the fungus colonized the highest proportion of root tips. The fungus persists throughout {{the life of the}} tree, having been found in tree stands that were 41, 65, and 122 years old. There is, however, a relative reduction in the prevalence of the fungus with increasing stand age, which may be attributed to increased competition from other fungi, and a change in habitat brought about by closure of the forest canopy. Generally, S.brevipes responds favorably to silvicultural practices such as thinning and clearcutting. A 1996 study demonstrated that fruit bodies increased in abundance as the severity of disturbance increased. It has been suggested that the thick-walled, wiry rhizomorphs produced by the fungus may serve as an adaptation that helps it to survive and remain viable {{for a period of time}} following disturbance.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} break out of Normandy, the Allied armies {{developed}} a <b>multi-stage</b> operation. It started with a British and Canadian attack along the eastern battle line around Caen in Operation Goodwood on 18 July. The German Army responded by sending a large portion of its armoured reserves to defend. Then, on 25 July thousands of American bombers carpet bombed a 6000-metre hole on the western end of the German lines around Saint-Lô in Operation Cobra, allowing the Americans to push forces through this hole in the German lines. After some initial resistance, the German forces were overwhelmed and the Americans broke through. On 1 August, Lieutenant General George S. Patton was named the commanding officer of the newly recommissioned US Third Army—which included large segments of the soldiers that had broken through the German lines—and with few German reserves behind the front line, the race was on. The Third Army quickly pushed south and then east, meeting very little German resistance. Concurrently, the British and Canadian troops pushed south (Operation Bluecoat) in an attempt to keep the German armour engaged. Under the weight of this British and Canadian attack, the Germans withdrew; the orderly withdrawal eventually collapsed due to lack of fuel.|$|E
5|$|Suillus collinitus is {{the most}} {{frequent}} fungus associating with Aleppo pine – a hardy tree utilised for reforestation schemes and soil conservation against erosion in the Mediterranean region. A study performed {{in the south of}} France discovered that S.collinitus and S.mediterraneensis are <b>multi-stage</b> ectomycorrhizal fungi, associating with both young and mature stands of Aleppo pine. These two species may {{play a key role in}} the survival and adaptation of this species of pine on disturbed calcareous sites. Roots mycorrhizal with S.collinitus were found capable of surviving successive disturbances by fire or ploughing. Moreover, the fungus retained its viability to propagate via its mycelial network which helped the recolonisation effort of newly introduced trees. The fungus has also been shown to improve the growth of Mediterranean pines grown in greenhouses and nurseries. Unlike other Suillus species that grow in wet climates, such as S.grevillei and S.spraguei, S.collinitus does not typically produce fruit bodies in young plantations. This fruiting behaviour may be attributed to the typically nutrient-poor xeric Mediterranean environment in combination with a lack of tree canopy. The absence of above-ground indicators of fungal presence makes analysis of underground populations difficult; molecular markers have been developed to assist in monitoring fungal growth and ectomycorrhizal formation and persistence in young plantations.|$|E

It is well known that major progress towards the goal of timeliness can be achieved if the scheduling problem is solved properly. As most scheduling algorithms (e. g.
