50|$|As {{with other}} Pentax DSLRs, the *ist DS uses the Pentax KAF bayonet mount and can use older lenses using the KA-mount without limitations. Original K mount lenses and, with adapter also M42 screw-mount lenses, {{can be used}} in manual mode by {{selecting}} a menu option. Centre-weighted metering, aperture priority and focus indication are maintained, even with adapter <b>mounted</b> <b>lenses.</b> When using non-auto aperture lenses, a press of the AE-L button with the camera in manual mode will meter the scene and set the shutter speed. Some non-Pentax K-mount lenses have been reported not to mount on the camera, because a plate protecting the aperture stop-down lever is slightly deeper.|$|E

Because of this, the Hexar RF can <b>mount</b> and focus <b>lenses</b> {{designed for}} the Leica and other compatible M-mount cameras or, when used with an adapter, the earlier Leica thread <b>mount</b> <b>lenses</b> (note that due to physical constraints there is no adapter to allow bayonet <b>mount</b> <b>lenses</b> to be fitted to a Leica screw-mount camera).|$|R

50|$|Macro {{photography}} {{may also}} be accomplished by <b>mounting</b> a <b>lens</b> in reverse, {{in front of a}} normally <b>mounted</b> <b>lens</b> of greater focal length, using a macro coupler which screws into the front filter threads of both lenses. This method allows most cameras to maintain the full function of electronic and mechanical communication with the normally <b>mounted</b> <b>lens,</b> for features such as open-aperture metering. The magnification ratio is calculated by dividing the focal length of the normally <b>mounted</b> <b>lens</b> by the focal length of the reversed lens (e.g., when an 18 mm <b>lens</b> is reverse <b>mounted</b> on a 300 mm lens the reproduction ratio is 16:1). The use of automatic focus is not advisable if the first lens is not of the internal-focusing type, as the extra weight of the reverse-mounted lens could damage the autofocus mechanism. Working distance is significantly less than the first lens.|$|R
50|$|Cosina Voigtländer {{refers to}} {{photographic}} {{products manufactured by}} Cosina under the Voigtländer name since 1999. Cosina leases rights to the Voigtländer name from RINGFOTO GmbH & Co. ALFO Marketing KG in Germany. Cosina Voigtländer products have included 35mm film SLR and rangefinder camera bodies, and lenses for the M39 <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> (Leica screw <b>mount),</b> M42 <b>lens</b> <b>mount,</b> Leica M <b>mount,</b> and other <b>lens</b> <b>mounts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The SD10 {{supports}} only Sigma SA <b>mount</b> <b>lenses.</b> Only Sigma produces lenses to {{fit this}} mount, although their range is fairly broad. Third-party converters exist {{for a number}} of other <b>lens</b> <b>mounts,</b> although no automatic features are supported. Many Canon EF <b>mount</b> based <b>lenses</b> can be converted to Sigma AF mount retaining autofocus and camera controlled apterture setting, however optical stabilisation will not work.|$|R

50|$|Canon FL {{refers to}} a <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> {{standard}} for 35mm single-lens reflex cameras from Canon. It was introduced in April 1964 with the Canon FX camera, replacing the previous Canon R <b>lens</b> <b>mount.</b> It was in turn replaced in 1971 by the Canon FD <b>lens</b> <b>mount.</b> FL <b>lenses</b> {{can also be used}} on FD-mount cameras.|$|R
50|$|With an {{diameter}} of 42mm the <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> has a comparatively large flange focal distance of 25.5 mm the 35 mm full-frame format Leica M mount is only 2 mm larger (despite this, M <b>mount</b> <b>lenses</b> cannot be <b>mounted</b> on NX camera with preserving infinity focus.|$|R

50|$|The Kiev 88 <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> was {{modified}} to accept most Pentacon Six <b>mount</b> <b>lenses</b> around 1999 and designated the Kiev 88CM. Many of these cameras {{have found their}} way around the world, especially to the United States. They are considered inexpensive alternatives in the medium film format camera market (see below).|$|R
5000|$|The K200D's <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> is the K-mount; {{so it is}} {{compatible}} with Pentax (and third-party) lenses dating {{as far back as}} 1975 without the use of adaptors. As all Pentax DSLR's it can use previous M42 <b>mount</b> <b>lenses</b> in manual mode with an adapter, provided by Pentax or independent manufacturers.|$|R
50|$|All Sigma SLR, DSLR, and mirrorless cameras use the Sigma SA mount, {{which is}} {{mechanically}} {{similar to the}} Pentax K mount and electrically an adaptation of the Canon EF <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> <b>lens</b> control system.|$|R
50|$|The Leica M9 is {{a digital}} full-frame {{rangefinder}} camera. It {{was introduced by}} Leica Camera AG in September 2009. It uses an 18.5-megapixel Kodak image sensor, and is compatible with almost all M <b>mount</b> <b>lenses.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 300D was {{the first}} camera to use the Canon EF-S <b>lens</b> <b>mount.</b> It also takes the EF <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> <b>lenses.</b> Canon {{introduced}} the EF-S 18-55mm as the kit lens alongside the 300D. It was available in a USM version in Japan and as a non-USM version elsewhere. Very late production black 300D cameras were available with the USM version in Europe.|$|R
5000|$|... == R-D1 == R-D1 was jointly {{developed}} by Seiko Epson and Cosina and manufactured by the latter, which also builds the current Voigtländer cameras. It uses Leica M-mount lenses or earlier Leica screw <b>mount</b> <b>lenses</b> with an adapter.|$|R
50|$|Many cameras with {{interchangeable}} lenses use a bayonet <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> to allow <b>lenses</b> {{to be changed}} rapidly and locked accurately in position. Camera <b>lens</b> <b>mounts</b> usually employ stronger flattened tabs rather than pins, though their function is the same.|$|R
50|$|Accessories: Genuine leather case, {{microscope}} adapter, M24 <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> TO M39 <b>lens</b> <b>mount</b> adapter for Zenit SLR lenses, {{with flange}} to film plane distance of 45.2 mm. M39 LTM mount with flange to film plane distance 28.8 mm not applicable.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{having an}} APS-C sensor, the 10D was {{introduced}} before EF-S lenses became available and was incompatible with them. The 10D was {{only able to}} <b>mount</b> EF <b>lenses.</b> All successive Canon Digital SLR cameras with APS-C sensors can <b>mount</b> EF-S <b>lenses.</b>|$|R
50|$|Compatibility {{problems}} have been experienced when <b>mounting</b> <b>lenses</b> with aperture transmission levers (e.g., SMC Takumars) on older bodies such as Zenit-E or Mamiya DTL. The aperture lug or a pin can interlock with the screwheads affixing the mount, which then impedes lens removal.|$|R
5000|$|The {{camera is}} {{compatible}} with all K mount lenses; K <b>mount</b> <b>lenses</b> started being made in 1975. Lenses without the [...] "A" [...] aperture setting will only meter properly using stop-down metering. Manual focus lenses will continue to function as manual-focus only.|$|R
50|$|The CONTAX N-series was an {{autofocus}} 35 mm SLR system, based {{around an}} entirely new electronic bayonet mount that was not compatible with previous CONTAX C/Y <b>mount</b> <b>lenses.</b> Three models were made: the N1, the NX and the N Digital, an early full-frame digital SLR.|$|R
50|$|The FM accepts all Nikon F bayonet <b>mount</b> <b>lenses,</b> {{with certain}} {{limitations}} or exceptions. Full compatibility requires lenses {{that support the}} Automatic Maximum-Aperture Indexing (AI) specification. This includes most Nikon lenses manufactured after 1977. Pre-AI lenses can be used, but only with stop-down metering.|$|R
5000|$|The Canon EOS 650 is a 35 mm single-lens reflex camera. It was {{introduced}} on 2 March 1987, Canon's 50th anniversary,and discontinued in February 1989. [...] It {{was the first}} camera in Canon's new EOS series, which was designed from scratch to support autofocus lenses. The EOS system featured the new EF <b>lens</b> <b>mount,</b> which used electrical signals to communicate between the camera and the lens.Focusing and aperture control were performed by electric motors <b>mounted</b> in the <b>lens</b> body. The EF mount is still used on Canon SLRs, including digital models. Canon's previous FD <b>mount</b> <b>lenses</b> are incompatible with EOS bodies.|$|R
