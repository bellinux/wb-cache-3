The Model-based approaches are fast and simple, but sensitive to occlusion and usually require high resolution images which may be not available in many applications such as driver <b>monitoring</b> <b>or</b> video <b>surveillance.</b> Appearance-based approaches suffer from information about identity and lighting which are contained in the face appearance.

Such threats can take for example the form of a group of terrorists trying to reach their target by car, or a truck filled with chemical or radioactive material. These threats require homeland security agencies to rapidly deploy <b>monitoring</b> <b>or</b> <b>surveillance</b> units in key junctions, dispatch air units to central locations etc. Clearly, carrying out this mission relies on the knowledge of what are those key traffic junctions, and how to deploy the existing (and always on shortage) resources most efficiently.

In many appli-cations, cameras are required to collaboratively track ob-jects (e. g., habitat <b>monitoring,</b> <b>or</b> <b>surveillance).</b> In smart networks, camera coverage control is necessary to allow au-tomatic tracking of targets without human intervention, al-lowing these systems to scale. In this paper, we consider the problem of automatic control of the cameras to maximize coverage of a set of targets. We formulate an optimization problem with the goal of maximizing the number of cov-ered targets. Since the optimization problem is NP-hard, even for static targets, we propose a computationally effi-cient heuristic to reach near-optimal solution. Centralized solutions achieve excellent coverage, and can work well for small-scale networks, however they require significant com-munication cost for large scale networks. As a result, we propose an algorithm that spatially decomposes the network and computes optimal solutions for individual partitions. By decomposing the partitions in a way that minimizes de-pendencies between them, this approach results in coverage quality close to the centralized optimal solution, with an overhead and reaction time similar to those of distributed solutions...|$|E

The peculiarities of the Terahertz Band, which is the envisioned frequency band for communication among nano-devices, and the extreme energy limitations of nanosensors, which {{require the use of}} nanoscale energy harvesting systems, introduce major challenges in the design of MAC protocols for WNSNs. This paper aims to design energy and spectrum-aware MAC protocols for WNSNs with the objective to achieve fair, throughput and lifetime optimal channel access by jointly optimizing the energy harvesting and consumption processes in nanosensors. Towards this end, the critical packet transmission ratio (CTR) is derived, which is the maximum allowable ratio between the transmission time and the energy harvesting time, below which a nanosensor can harvest more energy than the consumed one, thus achieving perpetual data transmission. Based on the CTR, first, a novel symbol-compression scheduling algorithm, built on a recently proposed pulse-based physical layer technique, is introduced. The symbol-compression solution utilizes the unique elasticity of the inter-symbol spacing of the pulse-based physical layer to allow a large number of nanosensors to transmit their packets in parallel without inducing collisions. In addition, a packet-level timeline scheduling algorithm, built on a theoretical bandwidth-adaptive capacity-optimal physical layer, is proposed with an objective to achieve balanced single-user throughput with infinite network lifetime. The simulation results show that the proposed simple scheduling algorithms can enable nanosensors to transmit with extremely high speed perpetually without replacing the batteries.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{study the}} nature and extent of {{evaluation}} research in occupational health services (OHSs). METHODS: Literature review of evaluation research in OHSs. On the basis of a conceptual model of OHS evaluation, empirical studies are categorised into aspects of input, process, output, outcome, and OHS core activities. RESULTS: Many methods to evaluate OHSs or OHS activities exist, depending on the objective and object of evaluation. The amount of empirical studies on evaluation of OHSs or OHS activities that met the non-restrictive inclusion criteria, was remarkably limited. Most of the 52 studies were more descriptive than evaluative. The methodological quality of most studies was not high. A differentiated picture of the evidence of effectiveness of OHSs arises. Occupational health consultations and occupational rehabilitation are hardly studied despite much time spent on the consultation by occupational physicians in most countries. The lack of effectiveness and efficiency of the pre-employment examination should lead to its abandonment as a means of selection of personnel by OHSs. Periodic health <b>monitoring</b> <b>or</b> <b>surveillance,</b> and education on occupational health hazards can be carried out with reasonable process quality. Identification and evaluation of occupational health hazards by a workplace survey can be done with a high output quality, which, however, does not guarantee a favourable outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Although rigorous study designs are not always applicable or feasible in daily practice, much more effort should be directed at the scientific evaluation of OHSs and OHS instruments. To develop evidence-based occupational health care the quality of evaluation studies should be improved. In particular, process and outcome of consultation and rehabilitation activities of occupational physicians need to be studied more...|$|E
40|$|Hyperspectral imagery offers unique {{benefits}} for detection {{of land and}} water features due to {{the information contained in}} reflectance signatures such as the bi-directional reflectance distribution function or BRDF. The reflectance signature directly shows the relative absorption and backscattering features of targets. These features can be very useful in shoreline <b>monitoring</b> <b>or</b> <b>surveillance</b> applications, for example to detect weathered oil. In real-time detection applications, processing of hyperspectral data can be an important tool and Optimal band selection is thus important in real time applications in order to select the essential bands using the absorption and backscatter information. In the present paper, band selection is based upon the optimization of target detection using contrast algorithms. The common definition of the contrast (using only one band out of all possible combinations available within a hyperspectral image) is generalized in order to consider all the possible combinations of wavelength dependent contrasts using hyperspectral images. The inflection (defined here as an approximation of the second derivative) is also used in order to enhance the variations in the reflectance spectra {{as well as in the}} contrast spectrua in order to assist in optimal band selection. The results of the selection in term of target detection (false alarms and missed detection) are also compared with a previous method to perform feature detection, namely the matched filter. In this paper, imagery is acquired using a pushbroom hyperspectral sensor mounted at the bow of a small vessel. The sensor is mechanically rotated using an optical rotation stage. This opto-mechanical scanning system produces hyperspectral images with pixel sizes on the order of mm to cm scales, depending upon the distance between the sensor and the shoreline being monitored. The motion of the platform during the acquisition induces distortions in the collected HSI imagery. It is therefore necessary to apply a motion correction to the imagery. In this paper, imagery is corrected for the pitching motion of a vessel, which causes most of the deformation when the vessel is anchored at 2 points (bow and stern) during the acquisition of the hyperspectral imagry...|$|E

Motivated by the large scale of sensor deployment, the high cost of wireless communications, the limited capabilities of sensor nodes, and the hostility of the encompassing environment, we design distributed protocols for topology management and network synchronization.

The super-node functionality is rotated among network nodes to achieve load balancing and prolong the lifetime of every individual sensor. For sensors deployed in harsh environments, we propose a methodology for improving the connectivity of the hierarchical network and providing opportunities for multi-path routing.
