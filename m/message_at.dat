5|$|When Schaefer {{rejected}} Hearst's {{offer to}} suppress the film, Hearst banned every newspaper and station in his media conglomerate from reviewing—or even mentioning—the film. He also had many movie theaters ban it, and many did not show it through fear of being socially exposed by his massive newspaper empire. The Oscar-nominated documentary The Battle Over Citizen Kane lays {{the blame for the}} film's relative failure squarely at the feet of Hearst. The film did decent business at the box office; it went on to be the sixth highest grossing film in its year of release, a modest success its backers found acceptable. Nevertheless, the film's commercial performance fell short of its creators' expectations. Hearst's biographer David Nasaw points out that Hearst's actions were not the only reason Kane failed, however: the innovations Welles made with narrative, as well as the dark <b>message</b> <b>at</b> the heart of the film (that the pursuit of success is ultimately futile) meant that a popular audience could not appreciate its merits.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps no {{director}} better displayed {{that spirit}} than the German-born Robert Siodmak, {{who had already}} made a score of films before his 1940 arrival in Hollywood. Working mostly on A features, he made eight films now regarded as classic-era film noirs (a figure matched only by Lang and Mann). In addition to The Killers, Burt Lancaster's debut and a Hellinger/Universal co-production, Siodmak's other important contributions to the genre include 1944's Phantom Lady (a top-of-the-line B and Woolrich adaptation), the ironically titled Christmas Holiday (1944), and Cry of the City (1948). Criss Cross (1949), with Lancaster again the lead, exemplifies how Siodmak brought {{the virtues of the}} B-movie to the A noir. In addition to the relatively looser constraints on character and <b>message</b> <b>at</b> lower budgets, the nature of B production lent itself to the noir style for economic reasons: dim lighting saved on electricity and helped cloak cheap sets (mist and smoke also served the cause); night shooting was often compelled by hurried production schedules; plots with obscure motivations and intriguingly elliptical transitions were sometimes the consequence of hastily written scripts, of which there was not always enough time or money to shoot every scene. In Criss Cross, Siodmak achieved these effects with purpose, wrapping them around Yvonne De Carlo, playing the most understandable of femme fatales; Dan Duryea, in one of his many charismatic villain roles; and Lancaster as an ordinary laborer turned armed robber, doomed by a romantic obsession.|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} suggests {{a relationship between}} technology use and self-esteem. Such research has failed to consider young school-aged children and {{their use of the}} internet, particularly across contexts. Thirty-eight children aged 6 to 8 years rated the level and nature of their internet use (email, instant message, play games, visit websites) at home, school and in the community (i. e., at someone else’s house). They also rated items that measured home, school and peer self-esteem. Instant <b>messaging</b> <b>at</b> school explained 21 % of the differences in school self-esteem. As children tended to report instant <b>messaging</b> <b>at</b> school, they also tended to report the highest school-based self-esteem. Instant <b>messaging</b> <b>at</b> someone else’s house explained 11 % of the differences in home self-esteem. As children tended to report instant <b>messaging</b> <b>at</b> someone else’s house, they also tended to report the lowest home self-esteem. Visiting websites at someone else’s house explained 10 % of the differences in peer self-esteem. As children tended to report visiting websites at someone else’s house, they also tended to report the highest peer self-esteem. Internet use during the early school years is related to children’s sense of self and mediated by context. </p...|$|R
25|$|Arriving at Tantalus after midnight, {{they woke}} up the {{telegraph}} operator who sent out a message about the disaster with no response—all the other operators were asleep. The first to receive the <b>message,</b> <b>at</b> 9:00a.m. on September26, was at Whitehorse. The first ship {{to arrive at the}} scene of the explosion was the sternwheeler Victorian, arriving at 7:00p.m.. Captain Williams had returned that morning; Christianson and Woods had died during the night. Murray died shortly after being carried aboard the Victorian.|$|E
25|$|By this point, {{reception}} {{had been}} automated, but {{the speed and}} accuracy of the transmission were still limited to the skill of the human operator. The first practical automated system was patented by Charles Wheatstone, the original inventor of the telegraph. The message (in Morse code) was typed onto a piece of perforated tape using a keyboard-like device called the 'Stick Punch'. The transmitter automatically ran the tape through and transmitted the <b>message</b> <b>at</b> the then exceptionally high speed of 70 words per minute.|$|E

25|$|This {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{concepts}} behind the Vanish computer project at the University of Washington, where a random key is used to encrypt data, and the key is distributed as a secret across several nodes in a P2P network. In order to decrypt the <b>message,</b> <b>at</b> least t nodes on the network must be accessible; the principle for this particular project being that the number of secret-sharing nodes on the network will decrease naturally over time, therefore causing the secret to eventually vanish. However, the network is vulnerable to a Sybil attack, thus making Vanish insecure.|$|E
25|$|A Howler is a blood-red {{letter sent}} to signify extreme anger or {{to convey a}} message very loudly and publicly. When it is opened, the sender's voice, which has been magically {{magnified}} to a deafening volume, bellows a <b>message</b> <b>at</b> the recipient and then self-destructs. If it is not opened or there is a delay in opening it, the letter smolders, explodes violently, and shouts the message out even louder than normal. In the film version, the Howler folds itself into an origami-style set of lips and eyes, and shouts the message out and then shreds itself into scraps of paper before it burns itself.|$|E
25|$|Performance of cross {{interleaver}} : As {{shown in}} the above interleaver figure, the output is nothing but the diagonal symbols generated {{at the end of}} each delay line. In this case, when the input multiplexer switch completes around half switching, we can read first row at the receiver. Thus, we need to store maximum of around half <b>message</b> <b>at</b> receiver in order to read first row. This drastically brings down the storage requirement by half. Since just half message is now required to read first row, the latency is also reduced by half which is good improvement over the block interleaver. Thus, the total interleaver memory is split between transmitter and receiver.|$|E

A staff officer rode up to Warren at about 9:30a.m. and handed him Webb's <b>message.</b> <b>At</b> the same time that Webb sent this message to Warren, 6:00a.m., Meade sent a telegram to Grant stating that Warren would be at Dinwiddie soon with his whole corps and would require further orders. Warren reported to Meade on the successful movement of the corps and stated that while he had not personally met with Sheridan, Griffin had spoken with him. The failure of Warren to report directly to Sheridan may have contributed to his relief from command later on April 1. Warren reported to Sheridan about 11:00a.m.|$|E

It had been her long-standing wish to go on a pilgrimage to Pandharpur, but Ambedkar had refused to let her go, telling her that he would create a new Pandharpur for her instead of Hinduism's Pandharpur which treated them as untouchables.
