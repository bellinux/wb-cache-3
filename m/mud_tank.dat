50|$|A flow line, {{used on a}} {{drilling}} rig, is a large diameter pipe (typically a section of casing) that {{is connected to the}} bell nipple (under the drill floor) and extends to the possum belly (on the <b>mud</b> <b>tanks)</b> and acts as a return line, (for the drilling fluid as it comes out of the hole), to the <b>mud</b> <b>tanks.</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>mud</b> <b>tank</b> is an open-top container, {{typically}} made {{of square}} steel tube and steel plate, to store drilling fluid on a drilling rig. They are also called mud pits, {{as they were}} once simple pits in the earth.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Mud</b> <b>Tank</b> and Mount Weld carbonatites {{take the}} form of {{multi-stage}} cylindrical intrusive bodies with several distinct phases of carbonatite intrusion. Smaller carbonatite sills and dikes are present in other Proterozoic mobile belts in Australia, typically as dikes and discontinuous pods.|$|E
50|$|Solids {{control is}} a {{technique}} used in a drilling rig to separate the solids in the drilling fluids that are crushed by the drill bits and carried out of the well surface. Normally, a solid control system contains five stages: the <b>mud</b> <b>tank,</b> shale shaker, vacuum degasser, desander, desilter, and centrifuge. The shale shaker is used to separate big solids with diameter above 75μm, the desander addresses solids from 45-74μm, and the desilter segregates solids between 15-44μm. Sometimes the desander and desilter are combined as one high efficiency mud cleaner. When air enters the drilling fluids, a vacuum degasser is used to separate the air. When there is no air in the mud, the degasser works as a big agitator. All these stages are mounted {{on the top of}} the <b>mud</b> <b>tank.</b> After separating the solids, the clean mud can be pumped into the borehole again.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mud</b> <b>tanks</b> {{are divided}} into square tanks and {{cone-shaped}} tanks according to the shape difference of the tank bottom.|$|R
50|$|Supporting {{equipment}} is often required, and may include a drilling fluid (mud) recycling system, shale shaker, mud cleaner, centrifugal pump, and <b>mud</b> <b>tanks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A Bell nipple is {{a section}} of large {{diameter}} pipe fitted {{to the top of}} the blowout preventers that the flow line attaches to via a side outlet, to allow the drilling fluid to flow back over the shale shakers to the <b>mud</b> <b>tanks.</b>|$|R
50|$|The body of {{the tank}} is made by welding the steel plate and section, using the smooth cone-shape {{structure}} or the corrugated structure. The <b>mud</b> <b>tank</b> surface and passages are made of slip resistant steel plate and expanded steel plate. The mud tanks are made of the side steel pipe, all of the structure can be folded without barrier and pegged reliably. The surface of the tank {{is equipped with a}} water pipeline for cleaning the surface and equipment on the tank, it uses soaked zinc processing for the expanded steel plate. The ladder is made of channel steel to take responsibility the body, the foot board is made of expanded steel plate. The two-sided guard rails are installed the safe suspension hook. The <b>mud</b> <b>tank</b> is designed to be in a standard shanty to prevent the sand and the rain. The pipeline is installed in the tank to preserve the warm air heat.|$|E
50|$|The {{tanks are}} {{generally}} open-top and have walkways on top {{to allow a}} worker to traverse and inspect the level of fluids in the tanks. The walkways also allow access to other equipment that is mounted on the top. Recently, offshore drilling rigs have closed-in tanks for safety. The <b>mud</b> <b>tank</b> plays {{a critical role in}} mechanically removing destructive solids and sediment from costly land and offshore drilling systems.|$|E
50|$|A mud gun is {{designed}} {{for use in a}} solids control system of a drilling rig. It is a tool which is mainly used for mixing drilling mud in the circulatory system and to prevent the mud from precipitating. The structure of equipment is simple offering flexible operation and easy use. A mud gun is commonly used to guard against precipitates in a solids control system. The mud gun is installed in a <b>mud</b> <b>tank.</b>|$|E
50|$|An {{oilfield}} solids {{control system}} needs many centrifugal pumps {{to sit on}} or in <b>mud</b> <b>tanks.</b> The types of centrifugal pumps used are sand pumps, submersible slurry pumps, shear pumps, and charging pumps. They are defined for their different functions, but their working principle is the same.|$|R
50|$|A tank (also {{known as}} a meat shield) is a style of {{character}} in gaming, often associated with a character class. A common convention in real-time strategy games, role-playing games, fighting games, multiplayer online battle arenas and <b>MUDs,</b> <b>tanks</b> redirect enemy attacks or attention toward themselves {{in order to protect}} other characters or units. Since this role often requires them to suffer large amounts of damage, they rely on large amounts of vitality or armor, healing by other party members, evasiveness and misdirection, or self regeneration.|$|R
50|$|Shale shakers are {{the primary}} solids {{separation}} tool on a rig. After returning {{to the surface of}} the well the used drilling fluid flows directly to the shale shakers where it begins to be processed. Once processed by the shale shakers the drilling fluid is deposited into the <b>mud</b> <b>tanks</b> where other solid control equipment begin to remove the finer solids from it. The solids removed by the shale shaker are discharged out of the discharge port into a separate holding tank where they await further treatment or disposal.|$|R
50|$|Desanders and desilters {{are solid}} control {{equipment}} {{with a set}} of hydrocyclones that separate sand and silt from the drilling fluids in drilling rigs. Desanders are installed on top of the <b>mud</b> <b>tank</b> following the shale shaker and the degasser, but before the desilter. Desander removes the abrasive solids from the drilling fluids which cannot be removed by shakers. Normally the solids diameter for desander to be separated would be 45~74μm, and 15~44μm for desilter.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} the mud tanks that are needed on the {{drilling}} rig depends on {{the depth of the}} well, and also the mud demands of drilling. Normally the shale shaker and vacuum degasser and desander are mounted together on the same <b>mud</b> <b>tank</b> as the first tank at the oilfield, while desilter and centrifuge on the second tank. Also, the drilling rig has other different tanks such as a reserve tank, emergency tank, etc.|$|E
50|$|A mud cleaner is a {{combination}} of desanders and/or desilters mounted over a shaker with a fine mesh screen. A mud is fed to the inlet of the hydrocyclone (desander and/or desilter) to separate particles and the underflow passes to the fine screen mesh where in particles larger than barite are discarded and thrown away. In most drilling operations, a mud cleaner is installed in its mud systems. It is usually located in a <b>mud</b> <b>tank</b> in the same location as with the desilters.|$|E

40|$|Poster apresentado no 32 nd International Geological Congress, Florença, Itália, 20 - 28 Ag. 2004. In the {{northeast}} Portugal region (Trás-os-Montes), fluvial Cenozoic deposits {{are an important}} source of raw materials used in the construction industry. These deposits are mainly composed by gravel and sandy to muddy-gravel bodies, with some muddy-sand and clay bodies. These deposits are preserved in hilltops due to topographic inversion. The deposits are quarried for the extraction of sand and gravel. This coarse fraction is separated from the silt-clay matrix (mud) by wet sieving. The mud matrix consists on about 20 - 60 % of the extracted material. After the wet sieving process, the mud is located in settling tanks, usually placed in abandon areas of the quarries, or in a neighbor area. Because almost all the quarries are placed on hilltops, these tanks are usually found there or in the slopes of the hills. There are some environmental impacts associated to this extractive industry. Landscape degradation due to the decreasing of the topographic level, associated with the visual impact of the quarries and <b>mud</b> <b>tanks.</b> The instability of some <b>mud</b> <b>tanks</b> is another hazard, due to the potential occurrence of mass movements. The mud also reduces the soil development and the vegetation growth. Therefore, soil recovery is a difficult process constituting a negative effect on land populations. To know the main characteristics of these waste muds, compositional studies and technological tests were performed. The results indicate suitability for application in ceramic construction industry (manufacture of bricks, tiles and other related materials). The compositional and technological characterization of these waste muds indicate their potential as a useful sub-product. The use of the waste muds in the ceramic construction industry will increment the economic value of these deposits as a natural resource. This procedure will also contribute to the mitigation of the environmental impact caused by this extractive industry. This approach can be implemented in other quarries contributing to the sustainable use of this natural resource. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT) - POCTI/CTA/ 38659 / 2001. FEDER...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} {{combined}} conduction-natural convection heat transfer in vertical eccentric annuli {{is of great}} importance because of its many engineering applications in electrical, nuclear, solar and thermal storage fields. A typical application {{is that of the}} drilling operations of oil and gas wells. During drilling operations liquid muds are pumped from a surface <b>mud</b> <b>tank</b> via the drill pipe (several kilometers in length), through nozzles in the rotating drill bit, and back to the <b>mud</b> <b>tank</b> through the annular space between the well bore wall and the drill pipe. Natural convection may occur during idle periods and it can contribute to passive cooling of the drill ipe. p In spite of many studies in the literature for the conventional case of either forced or free convection in the developing region of eccentric annuli [1 - 4], there are few research papers available for the conjugate case in vertical eccentric annuli. The first is that of El-Shaarawi and Haider [5] for the forced convection case. They presented forced convection results for a fluid of Prandtl number 0. 7 flowing in a fluid annulus of radius ratio 0. 5 with eccentricities 0. 1, 0. 3, 0. 5 and 0. 7.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the design and}} construction of an automatic drilling fluid measurement setup {{and the use of}} such setup to control the drilling fluid pH. The construction of the experimental setup include modifications to the acquired rheometer to obtain reliable batch rheology measurements within the typical viscosity range of a shear-thinning drilling fluid ([0. 02 - 0. 15]Pas). A model-based control approach is taken to control the drilling fluid pH. With help of a static model we have defined a new scaling method which enables us to get an estimate of the required control fluid to shift the pH up to a mud volume of 32 L. Implementation of the model shows that the pH can be maintained within the desired operating window if the quantity of control fluid is adjusted properly. The right quantity of control fluid is achieved by adjusting the estimated quantity of control fluid with help of a tuning parameter a. Results of this thesis show that to be able to control the pH at rig-scale, which is a dynamic process, closed-loop pH control based on the flux {{in and out of the}} <b>mud</b> <b>tank</b> should be implemented. The closed-loop pH control utilizes two pH sensors, the new scaling method and the signal from the Coriolis flow meter to add the right quantity of control fluid to stabilize the pH of the drilling fluid into the well. Based on the results that show the advantages of measuring both incoming and outgoing fluid properties at the active <b>mud</b> <b>tank,</b> a twin skid construction for rig-scale implementation is proposed. ?Petroleum EngineeringGeoscience & EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
