50|$|A related technique, {{electrostatic}} force microscopy (EFM), directly measures the force produced on a charged tip by the electric field {{emanating from the}} surface. EFM operates much like <b>magnetic</b> <b>force</b> <b>microscopy</b> in that the frequency shift or amplitude change of the cantilever oscillation is used to detect the electric field.

40|$|Abstract — We {{propose a}} {{solution}} to the image deconvolution problem where the convolution kernel or point spread function (PSF) is assumed to be only partially known. Small perturbations generated from the model are exploited to produce a few principal components explaining the PSF uncertainty in a high-dimensional space. Unlike recent developments on blind deconvolution of natural images, we assume the image is sparse in the pixel basis, a natural sparsity arising in <b>magnetic</b> resonance <b>force</b> <b>microscopy</b> (MRFM). Our approach adopts a Bayesian Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampling framework. The performance of our Bayesian semi-blind algorithm for sparse images is superior to previously proposed semi-blind algorithms such as the alternating minimization algorithm and blind algorithms developed for natural images. We illustrate our myopic algorithm on real MRFM tobacco virus data.

40|$|We review {{recent efforts}} to detect {{small numbers of}} nuclear spins using <b>magnetic</b> {{resonance}} <b>force</b> <b>microscopy.</b> <b>Magnetic</b> resonance <b>force</b> <b>microscopy</b> (MRFM) is a scanning probe technique that relies on the mechanical measurement of the weak <b>magnetic</b> <b>force</b> between a microscopic magnet and the magnetic moments in a sample. Spurred by the recent progress in fabricating ultrasensitive force detectors, MRFM has rapidly improved its capability over the last decade. Today it boasts a spin sensitivity that surpasses conventional, inductive nuclear magnetic resonance detectors by about eight orders of magnitude. In this review we touch {{on the origins of}} this technique and focus on its recent application to nanoscale nuclear spin ensembles, in particular on the imaging of nanoscale objects with a three-dimensional (3 D) spatial resolution better than 10 nm. We consider the experimental advances driving this work and highlight the underlying physical principles and limitations of the method. Finally, we discuss the challenges that must be met in order to advance the technique towards single nuclear spin sensitivity [...] and perhaps [...] to 3 D microscopy of molecules with atomic resolution.

50|$|With {{the help}} of {{lithography}} techniques, {{it is possible to}} fabricate sub-micrometer size magnetic islands whose geometric arrangement reproduces the frustration found in naturally occurring spin ice materials. Recently R. F. Wang et al. reported the discovery of an artificial geometrically frustrated magnet composed of arrays of lithographically fabricated single-domain ferromagnetic islands. These islands are manually arranged to create a two-dimensional analog to spin ice. The magnetic moments of the ordered ‘spin’ islands were imaged with <b>magnetic</b> <b>force</b> <b>microscopy</b> (MFM) and then the local accommodation of frustration was thoroughly studied. In their previous work on a square lattice of frustrated magnets, they observed both ice-like short-range correlations and the absence of long-range correlations, just like in the spin ice at low temperature. These results solidify the uncharted ground on which the real physics of frustration can be visualized and modeled by these artificial geometrically frustrated magnets, and inspires further research activity.|$|E
