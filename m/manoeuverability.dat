The external forces predicted in such a way were used as the base for calculation of <b>manoeuverability</b> by means of computer programs. A new system for prediction of the coordinates of the centre of gravity of the ship during a measuring run was developed. The investigations have shown, that a containership tends to a course instability, and that the course stability makes worse in the case of decreasing speed. A bulb at the stern results in an unfavourable course stability. Nearly the same tendency will be produced by an asymmetrical after body.

40|$|The {{terrestrial}} {{progression of}} pterosaurs, the flying reptiles of the Mesozoic Era, has been debated {{for over two}} centuries. The recent discovery of quadrupedal pterodactyloid pterosaur tracks from Late Jurassic sediments near Crayssac, France, shows that the hindlimbs moved parasagittally, as in mammals, birds and other dinosaurs, and the hypertrophied forelimbs could make tracks both close to the body wall and far outside it. Their manus tracks are unique in form, position and kinematics, which would be expected because the forelimbs were used for flight. Here, we report the first record of a pterosaur landing track, which differs substantially from typical walking trackways. The individual landed on both hind feet in parallel fashion, dragged its toes slightly as it left the track, landed again almost immediately and placed the hindfeet parallel again, then placed its forelimbs on the ground, took another short step with both hindlimbs and adjusted its forelimbs, {{and then began to}} walk off normally.

40|$|The Instrument Landing System (ILS) {{has been}} in {{operation}} for about four decades. While this system has served aviation well {{during this period of}} rapidly growing aircraft traffic, speeds and variety, its limitations have steadily been coming to the forefront.

40|$|<b>Manoeuverability</b> {{is a key}} {{requirement}} for successful terrestrial locomotion, especially on variable terrain, and is a deciding factor in predator-prey interaction. Compared with straight-line running, bend running requires additional leg force to generate centripetal acceleration. In humans, {{this results in a}} reduction in maximum speed during bend running and a published model assuming maximum limb force as a constraint accurately predicts how much a sprinter must slow down on a bend given his maximum straight-line speed. In contrast, greyhounds do not slow down or change stride parameters during bend running, which suggests that their limbs can apply the additional force for this manoeuvre. We collected horizontal speed and angular velocity of heading of horses while they turned in different scenarios during competitive polo and horse racing. The data were used to evaluate the limits of turning performance. During high-speed turns of large radius horizontal speed was lower on the bend, as would be predicted from a model assuming a limb force limit to running speed.

40|$|Obtaining {{very high}} {{resolution}} seismic images of sediments near {{the sea floor}} in deep water is fraught with problems. The conventional approach has been to tow a subbottom profiler near the bottom but, if the water depth is a kilometre or more, vessel speed and <b>manoeuverability</b> are so restricted that it becomes more economical to mount the profiler on an autonomous underwater vehicle. Either way, the survey would be expensive. Moreover, in depths of a kilometre or more, source energy levels are so restricted that the depth of subbottom penetration {{is limited to a}} few tens of metres. A research program at the University of Mississippi has been investigating ways of improving seismic resolution while achieving significant penetration and has obtained some remarkable results in the Gulf of Mexico. Deploying a commercial watergun just {{below the surface of the}} water and towing a single-channel hydrophone array at a few hundred metres depth, the program has demonstrated that, in a thousand metres of water, sea-floor resolutions of tens of centimetres and penetration of hundreds of metres can be achieved.

40|$|Summary &mdash; In {{the present}} study we suggest the use of {{kinematics}} for measuring locomotive abil-ities of two lamb crossbreds, bred for meat production (Berrichons and BMC), facing three envi-ronmental conditions: walking on a regular mud floor, walking on a stony ground and jumping from an uphill slope. In order to observe their locomotive strategy, animals were free to move around. Classical kinematic analysis was modified {{in relationship to the}} experimental context. Spatial and tem-poral data (stride length and duration, time interval between footfalls of limbs, amplitude of angular variations of articular segments) were collected to quantify motor coordination and limb posture. The BMC spontaneously adopted a more extensive scale of gaits with lateral sequences, they also used a wider range of speeds (0. 8 - 2. 5 m/s) with larger stride length (0. 82 m) on the regular floor. On the stony ground, both breeds adapted their gaits in the same way, walking slowly (0. 5 - 1. 2 m/s). A large behavioural difference appeared between both breeds during the approach phase of the jump. For example, Berrichons slowed down and adjusted the feet position before jumping. Conversely, BMC showed the greatest <b>manoeuverability</b> as regards the obstacle. This study shows a difference in loco-motive stategies between breeds according to the exercice. It underlines a better ability of BMC to walk in the varying conditions that characterise extensive grassland. Thus, the data of kinematic analysi...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to the classical LQ control strategy, a new approach based on controllability theory has been implemented for the automatic simulation of a depth change <b>manoeuverability</b> for an SSK subma-rine. The main diff erences between both methodologies follow: (1) The controls obtained from the LQ controller appear in a feedback form. So, from a practical point of view {{it is necessary to}} complete the control system with a suitable Kalman fi lter to correct the data of the state provided by the sensors of the submarine. For the contrary, the controls obtained from the controllability theory do not require the use of those. (2) No constraints on the controls are imposed in the controllability strategy. This may lead in some cases, for instance for short times, to some unrealistic results with sharp changes of controls and states. With the LQ controller, these sharp changes may be corrected by using appropriate weights in the associated cost. This, however, re-quires a postprocessing work. (3) Concerning the accuracy of reaching the fi nal state, it is evident that the best strategy is controllability theory (see Figure 1). Never-theless, the LQ controller can be also designed to improve this prop-erty by choosing an appropriate cost functional. (4) As for the optimality of controls, we notice that the controls ob-tained from the controllability theory are optimal in the L 2 (0,T;) norm (see Figure 2). As indicated in the abstract, the present work is only a preliminary study on this topic. Many interesting open questions could be ana-lyzed...|$|E
40|$|Due to its {{advantages}} of realizing repeatable experiments, collecting data and isolating key factors, the bio-robotic model {{is becoming increasingly}} important {{in the study of}} biomechanics. The caudal fin of fish has long been understood to be central to propulsion performance, yet its contribution to <b>manoeuverability,</b> especially for homocercal caudal fin, has not been studied in depth. In the research outlined in this paper, we designed and fabricated a robotic caudal fin to mimic the morphology and the three-dimensional (3 D) locomotion of the tail of the Bluegill Sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus). We applied heave and pitch motions to the robot to model the movement of the caudal peduncle of its biological counterpart. Force measurements and 2 D and 3 D digital particle image velocimetry were then conducted under different movement patterns and flow speeds. From the force data, we found the addition of the 3 D caudal fin locomotion significantly enhanced the lift force magnitude. The phase difference between the caudal fin ray and peduncle motion was a key factor in simultaneously controlling the thrust and lift. The increased flow speed had a negative impact on the generation of lift force. From the average 2 D velocity field, we observed that the vortex wake directed water both axially and vertically, and formed a jet like structure with notable wake velocity. The 3 D instantaneous velocity field at 0. 6 T indicated the 3 D motion of the caudal fin may result in asymmetry wake flow patterns relative to the mid-sagittal plane and change the heading direction of the shedding vortexes. Based on these results, we hypothesized that live fish may actively tune the movement between the caudal fin rays and the peduncle to change the wake structure behind the tail and hence obtain different thrust and lift forces, which contributes to its high manoeuvrability...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{methodology}} to derive architectures and operational concepts for future earth-to-orbit and sub-orbital transportation systems. In particular, at first, it describes the activity flow, methods, and tools {{leading to the}} generation {{of a wide range}} of alternative solutions to meet the established goal. Subsequently, the methodology allows selecting a small number of feasible options among which the optimal solution can be found. For the sake of clarity, the first part of the paper describes the methodology from a theoretical point of view, while the second part proposes the selection of mission concepts and of a proper transportation system aimed at sub-orbital parabolic flights. Starting from a detailed analysis of the stakeholders and their needs, the major objectives of the mission have been derived. Then, following a system engineering approach, functional analysis tools as well as concept of operations techniques allowed generating a very high number of possible ways to accomplish the envisaged goals. After a preliminary pruning activity, aimed at defining the feasibility of these concepts, more detailed analyses have been carried out. Going on through the procedure, the designer should move from qualitative to quantitative evaluations, and for this reason, to support the trade-off analysis, an ad-hoc built-in mission simulation software has been exploited. This support tool aims at estimating major mission drivers (mass, heat loads, <b>manoeuverability,</b> earth visibility, and volumetric efficiency) as well as proving the feasibility of the concepts. Other crucial and multi-domain mission drivers, such as complexity, innovation level, and safety have been evaluated through the other appropriate analyses.

40|$|Observing the {{progress}} in the technology of unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) than it can be foreseen that in future the role of manned combat aircraft will be taken over more and more by unmanned systems. The abandonment of pilots allows for more freedom in the aerodynamic and structural design of vehicles in regard to weight or acceleration. However, new stealth constraints will have a severe impact on the freedom of scope. The design of UCAV configurations {{is driven by the}} special requirements of up-coming missions, as for instance the capabilities of long endurance flights joined with low observability. The new military demands have a crucial impact on the aerodynamic shape, and, hence, require new solutions for maneuver control in respect to integration of engine in- and outlets, ailerons and rudders, actuators and other devices. In particular UCAVs are suited to the exploitation of non-conventional control technologies, such as aerodynamic morphing, flow control, or thrust vectoring. This paper presents a numerical investigation of innovative leading edge morphing for aircraft applications and explores the feasibility of such technologies to enhance the <b>manoeuverability</b> of unmanned combat aerial vehicles. It is in particular concerned with the investigation of effectiveness of morphing devices for the aerodynamic control of UCAVs under the special constraints of needed low radar signature. One focal point of this work is the possibility to generate additional lift or role moments for UCAVs flying at different angles of attack without using classical flaps which would increase the risk of detection by higher radar signatures. Therefore, the objective of the numerical investigations is the evaluation of the potential and limitations of morphing leading edges especially for the enhancement of the maneuverability of Delta- and Lambda-wing configurations with their vortex-dominated flow field. Of special interest is flow control at high angles of attack (AoA) by targeting a minimized shape adaptation in order to generate needed additional lift, to induce rolling moments or {{to reduce the risk of}} the potential deleterious effects of vortex breakdown...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Med.) -University of Natal, Durban, 1990. The {{accurate}} {{differentiation of}} a ventricular from a supraventricular origin {{of a wide}} QRS tachycardia (QRS > 120 milliseconds) is an important clinical problem. Misdiagnosis of this arrhythmia can lead to institution of inappropriate drug therapy acutely with potentially catastrophic consequences. Various diagnostic aids {{have been used to}} obtain electrocardiographic potentials to aid in the differentiation. This report assesses the clinical usefulness of oesophageal electrocardiography in the differentiation of wide complex tachycardias and describes a simple, safe technique to obtain oesophageal electrocardiograms. Eighteen consecutive patients between the ages of 27 and 71 years who were haemodynamically stable were selected for this study. The technique was performed in the following manner: A temporary pacing catheter was lubricated and passed nasally and advanced with the patient being instructed to swallow. Adjustments in catheter depth were made as necessary to obtain an optimal recording on a standard electrocardiograph recorder. Satisfactory placement with minimal patient discomfort was achieved within 6. 5 minutes (average 4. 5 minutes) in all cases. High quality tracings were obtained in every instance. In the 18 patients with tachyarrhythmia, AV dissociation consistent with ventricular tachycardia was demonstrated in 11 instances; in the remainder the diagnosis was supraventricular tachycardia. Of the 11 patients diagnosed as ventricular tachycardia, 9 were initially misdiagnosed as supraventricular tachycardia, whilst only 1 of 7 patients with supraventricular tachycardia was misdiagnosed. This study has demonstrated that oesophageal electrocardiography is useful in the differentiation of wide complex tachycardias. The technique outlined in this report is simple and offers the following advantages: the temporary pacing catheter is associated with minimal discomfort; the catheter allows easy <b>manoeuverability</b> within the oesophagus which allows proper depth to be easily obtained; the equipment used is routinely available. Therefore the technique offers a rapid, safe and simple method of obtaining an oesophageal electrocardiogram which is invaluable in the electrocardiographic differentiation of a wide complex tachycardia...|$|E
40|$|Rotary-wing {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles (RUAVs) {{have created}} extensive {{interest in the}} past few decades due to their unique <b>manoeuverability</b> and because of their suitability in a variety of flight missions ranging from traffic inspection to surveillance and reconnaissance. The ability of a RUAV to operate from a ship in the presence of adverse winds and deck motion could greatly extend its applications in both military and civilian roles. This requires the design of a flight control system to achieve safe and reliable automatic landings. Although ground-based landings in various scenarios have been investigated and some satisfactory flight test results are obtained, automatic shipboard recovery is still a dangerous and challenging task. Also, the highly coupled and inherently unstable flight dynamics of the helicopter exacerbate the difficulty in designing a flight control system which would enable the RUAV to attenuate the gust effect. This thesis makes both theoretical and technical contributions to the shipboard recovery problem of the RUAV operating in rough seas. The first main contribution involves a novel automatic landing scheme which reduces time, cost and experimental resources in the design and testing of the RUAV/ship landing system. The novelty of the proposed landing system enables the RUAV to track slow-varying mean deck height instead of instantaneous deck motion to reduce vertical oscillations. This is achieved by estimating the mean deck height through extracting dominant modes from the estimated deck displacement using the recursive Prony Analysis procedure. The second main contribution is the design of a flight control system with gust-attenuation and rapid position tracking capabilities. A feedback-feedforward controller has been devised for height stabilization in a windy environment based on the construction of an effective gust estimator. Flight tests have been conducted to verify its performance, and they demonstrate improved gust-attenuation capability in the RUAV. The proposed feedback-feedforward controller can dynamically and synchronously compensate for the gust effect. In addition, a nonlinear H 1 controller has been designed for horizontal position tracking which shows rapid position tracking performance and gust-attenuation capability when gusts occur. This thesis also contains a description of technical contributions necessary for a real-time evaluation of the landing system. A high-infedlity simulation framework has been developed with the goal of minimizing the number of iterations required for theoretical analysis, simulation verification and flight validation. The real-time performance of the landing system is assessed in simulations using the C-code, which can be easily transferred to the autopilot for flight tests. All the subsystems are parameterized and can be extended to different RUAV platforms. The integration of helicopter flight dynamics, flapping dynamics, ship motion, gust effect, the flight control system and servo dynamics justifies the reliability of the simulation results. Also, practical constraints are imposed on the simulation to check the robustness of the flight control system. The feasibility of the landing procedure is confimed for the Vario helicopter using real-time ship motion data...|$|E
40|$|In Sri Lanka, the {{government}} and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam waged a civil war between 1983 and 2009. During this period the social and economic development in the north and east of the country was disrupted. Due to this disruption a development opportunity for this region is the expansion of the fishery industry. In 2016, the Sri Lankan government proposed the Northern Province Sustainable Fisheries Development Project, in which the construction of a harbour at Point Pedro in the Jaffna District is included. This harbour should become the second largest fishery harbour in Sri Lanka. This report covers the design study of the Point Pedro harbour project, the goal {{of this study is to}} design a safe, economically efficient and socially accepted harbour at Point Pedro. To achieve this goal, the following research question “How can safety, economic efficiency and environmental impact be combined optimally in a harbour design for Point Pedro in the Jaffna District?” is answered. In figure XX, the final design of the harbour can be seen. This design is focused on the optimal combination between safety, economic efficiency and environmental impact. Because these criteria are conflicting, they are prioritized as follows: (1) safety, (2) economic efficiency and (3) environmental impact. Safety is provided by constructing breakwaters around the harbour, providing sheltered water conditions in the harbour basin. Also, the harbour entrance is constructed in a way that monsoon waves cannot directly intrude into the basin. Economic efficiency is accounted for by constructing the quay wall close to the central located fish processing facilities. This optimizes the supply chain, resulting in a smaller loss in the fish production (compared to the current situation). The costs are optimized by reusing all dredged material inside the breakwater or for land reclamation. Additionally, the location of the harbour entrance is minimizing the sailing routes as much as possible, without creating safety issues due to wave intrusion. Finally, the negative effects of social impact are limited by involving local fishermen and residents during the entire development process. Because these stakeholders are potential blockers of the project, it is important to include their opinions in the design. This can also be done by broadening the scope, in which touristic facilities and accommodations can be included in the project. Other negative impacts of the harbour can be either mitigated or minimized. However, because the environmental impact is determined as the least important criteria, it is not able to solve every issue. This design is considered to be the most optimal combination for the harbour design of Point Pedro, regarding the criteria of safety, economic efficiency and environmental impact. It is recommended to EML Consultants that three characteristics of the proposed design should be implemented in their final design for Point Pedro: (1) apply building on the reef for land reclamation inside the harbour, (2) cluster the fish processing facilities near the unloading quay walls, because it optimizes the fish supply chain and reduces fish loss, and (3) construct the jetties for large boats (in the east of the harbour) as proposed, because it optimizes <b>manoeuverability</b> inside the harbour using minimal space. The final recommendation is to perform additional research to make a more accurate design, as the main limitation of the report is the limited amount of available data. Additional research should be done in the fields of; wave data, ground conditions over the entire harbour basin, cost estimation and sedimentation.
