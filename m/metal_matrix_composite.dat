25|$|Friction {{extrusion}} {{was invented}} at The Welding Institute in the UK and patented in 1991. It was originally intended {{primarily as a}} method for production of homogenous microstructures and particle distributions in <b>metal</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>composite</b> materials. Friction extrusion differs from conventional extrusion in that the charge (billet or other precursor) rotates relative to the extrusion die. An extrusion force is applied so as to push the charge against the die. In practice either the die or the charge may rotate {{or they may be}} counter-rotating. The relative rotary motion between the charge and the die has several significant effects on the process. First, the relative motion in the plane of rotation leads to large shear stresses, hence, plastic deformation in the layer of charge in contact with and near the die. This plastic deformation is dissipated by recovery and recrystallization processes leading to substantial heating of the deforming charge. Because of the deformation heating, friction extrusion does not generally require preheating of the charge by auxiliary means potentially resulting in a more energy efficient process. Second, the substantial level of plastic deformation in the region of relative rotary motion can promote solid state welding of powders or other finely divided precursors, such as flakes and chips, effectively consolidating the charge (friction consolidation) prior to extrusion.|$|E

The {{effect of}} size and volume {{fraction}} of ceramic particles with sliding {{speed on the}} wear properties were investigated for <b>metal</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>composites</b> fabricated by a pressureless metal infiltration process. The particulate <b>metal</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>composites</b> exhibited about 5. 5 - 6 times greater wear resistance compared with AC 8 A alloys at high sliding speed, and by increasing the particle size and decreasing the volume fraction the wear resistance improved. The wear resistance of the <b>metal</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>composites</b> and AC 8 A alloy represented different aspects: the wear loss of the AC 8 A alloy increased with sliding speed linearly, whereas, the <b>metal</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>composites</b> displayed more wear loss than the AC 8 A alloy in the slow-speed region.
