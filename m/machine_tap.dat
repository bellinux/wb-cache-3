40|$|International audiencePrevious {{research}} on the standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> {{has shown that the}} impact on a floor depends strongly on the combined system of floor and tapping hammers. This means that in general, a particular measure to reduce the impact sound pressure level can be advantageous with one impact source and disadvantageouswith another. Conversion from one impact source to another has to be made for each floor individually, provided there is a sufficient knowledge of the dynamic properties of the source and floor. So, if the standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> is to be used to characterise a floor with respect to walking noise, the only simple way out of the problem is to make it 'behave like a walker'. That means it should have the same source impedance. Investigations at the Fraunhofer-Institut für Bauphysik Stuttgart showed that this could be achieved by small modifications to the standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine.</b> Comparisons using a concrete floor and a wooden joist floor have proved that results using such a modified <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> are much closer to walking noise than the results using the standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine...</b>|$|R

40|$|Impact sound {{insulation}} {{is one of}} the most important aspects when assessing {{sound insulation}} of floor constructions in buildings. For assessing the impact sound insulation of aconstruction, a standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> is used as a sound source. However, the use of the current standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> has been criticised, especially with regard to measurement of wooden joist floors since the noise spectrum generated by a <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> differs from the spectrum generated by actual footfall. There are insufficient low frequency components in the noise spectrum produced by the <b>tapping</b> <b>machine</b> and it does not, therefore, accurately reflect low frequency noise from the construction. Reduce impact sound level from wooden joist floors are the main object of our study. It is important to be able to predict the sound insulation properties of wooden joist constructions at the design stage. To reduce the noise level in the receiving room, the input power transmitted through the construction must be estimated where the appropriate sound- and vibration-insulation can be designed. This study has investigated the waveform and frequency spectra of human footfall (walking, rum- ingand jumping); of the dropping of sand balls, sand bags and tires; and of the standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine.</b> The impact sound power radiation from a wooden joist construction while applying different impact sources, such as actual footfall and the standard <b>tapping</b> <b>machine,</b> have also been studied. Research was also carried out regarding the development of a practical impact sound insulation calculation method for wooden joist floor constructions. The characteristics with regard to mechanical properties of floor construction was calculated using the impedance method. The impact sound level inside the sound receiving room was determined.

40|$|Abstract: As an {{important}} internal thread <b>machining</b> method, <b>tapping</b> is frequently among the final operations performed on elaborately transformed manufactures. The added value is often near its peak when the tapping operation is carried out. Consequently, conservative cutting conditions often are employed to avoid costly tap failure. Taps and tapping also are amongst {{the most complex}} and least understood cutting tools and processes. In this paper, the geometry and specification of straight flute taps are discussed, followed by an outline {{of the development of}} computer-aided predictive models for side force, thrust force, and torque in <b>machine</b> <b>tapping,</b> based on Armarego’s ‘Unified-Generalized Mechanics of Cutting Approach’. This approach allows processes to be modelled based on their cutting action and geometry only, with material properties provided from a generic database. Unlike other tapping modelling approaches, this is a truly predictive methodology. The models allow for the transient and steady stages and they include all the tap and tapping geometrical variables and the tapping conditions, as well as the tool–workpiece material prop-erties. The models are verified through extensive numerical studies and a comprehensive exper-imental testing programme. Good qualitative and quantitative correlations are found between the predicted and measured average force components and torque. These models allow tool designers and process planners to optimize the generation and use of taps, thereby improving the competitiveness of this vital manufacturing operation. The results provide further evidence of the validity and generic nature of the unified-mechanics of cutting approach...|$|R

40|$|Drum {{sound is}} the sound {{produced}} when an object, such as a foot, hits the flooring in the room in which the receiving ear is located. Drum sound has attracted interest in recent years, particularly due to an increased use of thin floating floor constructions, such as veneer or laminate flooring, which can produce loud and sharp walking sound. A prediction model of the subjective response, in a paired comparison test, to drum sound based on differences in objective measurements is developed. The difference in 10 -percentile loudness, N 10, between two stimuli is shown to predict the subjective perceived disturbance better than, for example, A-weighted sound pressure level. A difference of about 8 % in N 10 resulted in 50 % of the assessors noticing a difference. A comparison of different existing approaches to analysing the result from a paired comparison test is made. The main focus is set on the basic models by Thurstone-Mosteller and Bradley-Terry and extensions of these concerning ties. Procedures for testing if the responses and calculated ranking values are statistically different are presented. The {{advantages and disadvantages of}} these methods are discussed. These methods are illustrated with examples from tests on drum sound from floor coverings. A branch norm has been established for measuring drum sound on laminate floor coverings. The norm evaluates the subjective perception of the drum sound's loudness using the ISO <b>tapping</b> <b>machine.</b> A round-robin study of the norm is reported along with the results of a paired comparison listening test using the same floor coverings.

Recent data collected on bare (wood and concrete) floors, suggest that in the low frequency range, the impedance of the source has no influence on the power injected into the floor. This is presumably due to the fact that the bare floors have much higher impedances than most common sources, meaning only the blocked force of the source influences the injected power.
