The most {{significant change in the}} institutional structure of European governance {{over the past two decades}} has been the increased power of the European Parliament (EP). Given the Parliament's growing influence and the dramatic European Union(EU) enlargement in 2004, it has become increasingly important to monitor the attitudes and behaviour of Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) from different member states. The European Parliament Research Group (EPRG) conducted two surveys of MEPs in 2000 and 2006. The 2000 survey was conducted in October-December 2000 and surveyed MEPs of the Fifth European Parliament (1999 - 2004). The 2006 survey was conducted in March-June 2006 and surveyed MEPs of the Sixth European Parliament (2004 - 09). Further information about the survey can be found on the EPRG MEP Survey web page or the ESRC Award web page. Main Topics : The surveys include the following categories of questions: personal details (<b>member</b> <b>state,</b> <b>date</b> first elected to EP, previous political experience) electoral systems and candidate selection campaigning aims and activities attitudes/behaviour relating to representation behaviour in committees and voting in the Parliament general political attitudes attitudes towards specific EU policies attitudes towards EU institutional reform </ul...|$|E

In 1999 the European Council further proposed to abolish formal extradition procedures for sentenced persons. However {{it was not until}} the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks in the United States that much more far reaching proposals were mooted. While originally proposed as an anti-terrorist measure the European Arrest Warrant soon became applicable to a wide range of ordinary crimes. The political decision to adopt the EAW legislation was made at the Laeken European Council in December 2001, the text being finally agreed in June of the following year.|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{agricultural}} subsidies on productivity {{has long been}} discussed in the literature without any clear conclusions. Many studies attempted {{to shed light on}} the topic by using various methods and data (mostly relying on geographically limited farm-level data). Depending on the model specification, statistical method and data source mixed results are reported. This study aims at estimating the impact of common agricultural policy Pillar II payments on agricultural productivity by using NUTS- 2 level data for the years 2007 - 2013 for the EU <b>member</b> <b>state</b> countries. We use a rather novel approach by simultaneously estimating a CES production function with productivity coefficients linked to the Pillar II payments. We use 4 categories of Pillar II payments (i. e. human capital, physical capital, agro-environmental and rural development) to explain the total factor productivity in agricultural sector. Our results suggest that regions receiving higher Pillar II payments for physical capital investments, human capital development or agro-environmental measures increase productivity. On the other hand, payments related to rural development do not have significant impact on productivity. The results do not change among the <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> <b>date</b> of access to the EU (i. e. old or new <b>member</b> <b>states),</b> spatial characteristics (i. e. being in the south, north or east) or size of the countries (i. e. big or small economies).

Half-hourly electricity readings of demand during normal operation and during response events have been analysed for different industry and service sectors.

40|$|The European Region of the World Health Organisation (WHO) {{took the}} global lead on Health For All when the Regional Committee in 1980 {{approved}} a European Health For All Strategy.

The paper reviews the progress of <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> to <b>date</b> towards the Regional Health For All goal. Progress is discussed within the context of the six fundamental principles which underpin the Health For All concept, vis: equity; health promotion; community involvement; multisectoral participation; primary (local) health care; and, international cooperation. The paper argues that the commitment of <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> to the Health For All Strategy has been patchy with only moderate success towards meeting the 38 Regional Targets. Poor progress is attributed to changing national and international political and economic circumstances and limited resources but perhaps most importantly to a lack of political will to take the strategy seriously.

40|$|Consultation {{of major}} {{interest}} groups {{is a widespread}} administrative practice in many EU <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> To <b>date</b> it is unclear, however, how advancing European integration influences domestic consultation practices. This article examines the impact of European integration on domestic consultation practices by conceptualizing how the underlying rationales of government-interest group interactions {{and the level of}} involvement of interest groups are affected by European integration. The study draws on original survey data on senior civil servants in Britain and the Netherlands to empirically examine these effects. European integration is related in a limited way to domestic consultation practices, both in Britain and the Netherlands. This small but significant effect is mostly observed during the process of domestic preference formulation in EU-level policy making. Our findings suggest that intra-organizational processes, for example organizational routines and task-specialization, potentially play a greater role than has thus far been appreciated in Europeanization studies. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|R

Once the Treaty of Accession is signed, it will be followed by a referendum in Croatia on joining the European Union, which – providing there is sufficient support for EU membership among Croatian voters – will in turn be followed by a longer process of national ratification in the EU <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> Although no <b>date</b> has been officially set, even for the completion of the accession talks, Croatian political leaders hope for EU entry on 1 January 2013, 1 while EU officials indicate that this might not happen before the end of 2013 or even in 20142 provided there are no further complications in the ratification pro...|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused {{in the new}} type of claims in {{international}} investment law – claims concerning the revocation of incentive schemes in the photovoltaic (PV) solar sector. The general research question of this work is an inquiry why countries succeed and fail in their renewable policies (RE) judging {{by the amount of}} investment disputes against them. The interaction between the EU and <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> concerning RE policies has both political and legal dimensions. The political dimension includes several unsuccessful attempts of harmonization of support schemes. The legal dimension helps to achieve this harmonization by indirect means, such as the requirement on permissible state aid. With the introduction of PV solar investment cases, this process attracted a new discussion of the viability of investment treaty arbitration (ITA) within the EU. <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> appear solely responsible for their renewable policies, promoted in the bottom-up regime from supranational level. This situation leads to the gap between supranational governance and control within the EU law, from one side, and responsibility and accountability under international investment law, from the other. The greatest risk for the EU seems to be the independence of investment tribunals, when the Commission has limited means of influence on the arbitral decision-making process. The structure of the thesis will first discuss the EU-level policies relating to the incentivization of RE among its <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> and how these policies relate to the investment treaty regime and the {{rise in the number of}} ITAs based on changes to the support schemes in the PV solar sector specifically. Second, this thesis will conduct an empirical analysis of RE policies (abridged for focus on PV solar energy) in selected EU <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> by describing the background of regulation, response to EU Directives, further growth of incentives and the current reduction of support measures. Third, and based on a policy review, the thesis will analyze which national regulatory measures have formed the basis of investment treaty claims and examine what investment protections may be further invoked by specifically concentrating on the fair and equitable treatment (FET) standard due to its universal character and growing popularity in ITA. The final section of the thesis will identify the factors arising from the different number of ITA cases against EU <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> to <b>date</b> and provide insights into how these cases might be resolved and how they will affect future arbitral practice as well as future policy choices on the incentivization of RE among EU <b>Member</b> <b>States...</b>|$|R
40|$|Ever {{since the}} Directive on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts of 1993, the European {{project has been}} working intensively towards {{harmonization}} of contract law across all EU <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> To <b>date,</b> virtually none of the many problems that have arisen have been resolved. The SECOLA Annual Conference convened in Prague in 2005 to consider the specific topic of unfair terms and to imagine {{ways in which the}} obstacles raised by this provocative issue might be overcome. In this book, which presents revised versions of the papers presented at that conference, fourteen outstanding European scholars examine basic questions about the differing conceptions of contract law in the national legal systems of the <b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> divergent legal techniques such as interpretation of contract and divergent approaches to legal reasoning, and contrasting views {{about the nature of the}} problems presented by unfair terms in contracts. Among the contentious matters discussed are the following: * the tension between party autonomy and social justice; * control over freedom of contract in the name of substantive fairness and efficiency; * interpretation of contract terms * the intrusion of competition law into contract law; * the disputed meanings of good faith and legitimate expectations; * the requirement of ‘plain intelligible language’; * and characterization problems Above all the essays ask: Can harmonization of European contract law be achieved? And if so, how? The answers offered not only clarify the stage we have arrived at in this ongoing initiative, but also identify the essential conflicts that must be understood if we are to secure meaningful regulation of contract terms at a transnational level. For these reasons the book is enormously valuable to all parties interested in this crucial component of European integration...|$|R
40|$|States vary {{considerably}} {{in their ability}} to attract federal research and development (R&D) sources. The National Science Foundation (NSF) Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) was created in the late 1970 s and was designed to enhance the research capacity of less competitive states in seeking federal research funds. How has EPSCoR improved research capacity in its <b>member</b> <b>states?</b> To <b>date,</b> little evaluation of EPSCoR as a program, or even within individual states, has occurred, and those studies that have been conducted have taken a statewide, macro-level approach. We argue that a social-capital-based approach that addresses capacity development among EPSCoR recipients provides important scientist-level data that can best address capacity development issues. In this article, we first examine the data of federal academic R&D obligations in order to analyze one of the direct outcomes of capacity building. We conduct a descriptive statistical analysis on the changing share of federal academic R&D obligations for individual states in recent years. Second, using an NSF-sponsored survey of scientists in the 50 states, we present data on distinctions between scientists in EPSCoR versus non-EPSCoR states, as well as differences between scientists who have been involved in EPSCoR versus those who have not. From our analysis we find important evidence of capacity development in EPSCoR states. Perhaps most importantly, our results provide an important first step in identifying relevant evaluative issues for EPSCoR. Copyright 2009 by The Policy Studies Organization. ...|$|R

50|$|When the German Confederation {{had been}} founded in 1815, some states had been anxious {{to prove they}} had a small {{population}} in order to contribute fewer soldiers to the Federal Army. On the other hand, when the first custom union between southern states were formed, they wanted to show they had a large population in order to claim {{a larger share of}} the custom revenue. The German Customs Union, the Zollverein, conducted population counts from 1834 to 1867, every three years on 3 December, in order to share its revenue among the <b>member</b> <b>states</b> accordingly. The <b>date</b> of 3 December was chosen as most people of the „Zollabrechnungsbevölkerung“, the custom accounting population, were expected to be at home then. The Eastern parts of Prussia remained outside of the Confederation for most of the time, but the whole of Prussia was part of the Zollverein. While most states joined the Zollverein sooner or later, the Austrian Empire never did until the German Confederation and the Zollverein broke up in the civil war of 1866. The Zollverein regrouped and held another census in 1867, but the census of 1870 was postponed due to the ongoing Franco-German War and the foundation of the German Empire.|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} the first {{in-depth}} academic discussion of the key aspects of the enhanced collective redress mechanisms introduced recently in relation to competition law infringements in the UK by the Consumer Rights Act. The legislation is a particularly significant development because of the historical and contemporary focus on the ‘consumer’ {{at the heart of}} competition/antitrust law and because the reforms also reflect more recent debates generally in legal practice about ‘access to justice’. The article first recounts the pivotal role played by ‘class actions’ in US antitrust enforcement before outlining the recent debate on encouraging and facilitating private enforcement in the EU, particularly in relation to collective redress, culminating in the (anodyne) Commission Recommendation of June 2013. As the article notes, most of the collective redress mechanisms introduced across the EU <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> to <b>date</b> have been opt-in models, but these have been criticised for their limited impact and effectiveness, and an opt-out representative model has been introduced in some <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> and discussed in others. The article will reflect on the limited provision in the UK on collective redress in relation to competition law infringements prior to the Consumer Rights Act, in particular the limitations in the opt-in follow-on procedure under s 47 B of the Competition Act 1998, as demonstrated by CA v JJB. The article will then focus on the Act’s provisions (and associated Tribunal rules) in relation to opt-in/opt-out collective proceedings and settlements (in both follow-on and stand-alone actions). The article will outline the new statutory provisions in sections 47 B and 49 A and B of the Competition Act 1998, for Collective Proceedings and Collective Settlements respectively. The Tribunal rules on certification will be considered, noting the potential difficulties in their practical application, before further analysis of two key problematic aspects of the proposed opt-out collective redress scheme, which may limit its effectiveness and uptake. The first concerns the appointment of the class/settlement representative and the second concerns the potential funding arrangements in relation to opt-out collective proceedings. The article questions whether the combination of these two aspects may dis-incentivise and unnecessarily limit the effectiveness of the new opt-out provisions, although it is accepted that this will also greatly depend on the Competition Appeal Tribunal interpretation and application of its new Tribunal Rules in relation to Collective proceedings, in particular regarding certification, appointment of the class/settlement representative and determination of the appropriate costs and expenses incurred in pursuing a collective claim...|$|R

5000|$|Bearer shares - Are a legal {{instrument}} denoting company ownership, {{and are usually}} {{in the form of}} share warrants. A share warrant is a document which states that the bearer of the warrant is entitled to the shares stated in it. If authorised by its articles, a company may convert any fully paid shares to [...] "share warrants". These warrants are easily transferable without any need for a transfer document; that is, they can simply be passed from hand to hand. When share warrants are issued, the company must strike out the name of the shareholder from its register of <b>members</b> and <b>state</b> the <b>date</b> of issue of the warrant and the number of shares to which it relates. Subject to the articles, a share warrant can be surrendered for cancellation. If so, the holder is entitled to be re-entered into the register of members. Vouchers are usually issued with the share warrants in order that any dividends may be claimed. (Bearer shares have been abolished in the UK by the Small Business Enterprise and Employment Act 2015. Existing Bearer shares must be converted to registered shares by February 2016 or the company will be obliged to apply to the Court to cancel them.) ...|$|R

Bankruptcy is perhaps the greatest and most humiliating calamity which can befall an innocent man. The greater part of men, therefore, are sufficiently careful to avoid it. Some, indeed, do not avoid it; as some do not avoid the gallows. ” These are the words of Adam Smith, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Na-tions. 1 In those days regulation of insolvency was rare too and sometimes contained criminal sanctions. Only a few bilateral treaties (within what now is the Netherlands and in Italy) existed. Nowadays however, the number of one in a thousand has become obsolete. In Europe in 2002, in the (then) fifteen <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> filings for insolvency amounted to a quarter of a mil-lion for individuals. In addition, around 150, 000 busi-nesses went into insolvency. The numbers have gone up dramatically as has the volume of legislation with re-gard to international or cross-border insolvency law. In 2000 the EU Insolvency Regulation No. 1346 / 2000 was created, which entered into force on 31 May 2002. For several financial institutions, falling outside the scope of the Regulation, Directive 2001 / 17 and Directive 2001 / 24 were issued in 2001 on the reorga-nization and winding-up of insurance undertakings and of credit institutions.
