40|$|All {{children}} should be protected from serious diseases. The CDC recommends that 11 and 12 year olds receive the MCV 4 vaccine to protect against <b>meningococcal</b> disease (<b>meningitis),</b> the Tdap vaccine to protect against pertussis (whooping cough), diphtheria, and tetanus, and the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine for girls to protect against cervical cancer. Possible Questions from Parents Why should my child receive the vaccines? <b>Meningococcal</b> disease (<b>meningitis)</b> can be very serious, even deadly. The disease can progress rapidly and result in death in 48 hours or less. Even with antibiotic treatment, adolescents die in about 10 % of cases. About 20 % of survivors will have long-term disability such as loss of a limb, deafness, nervous system problems, or brain damage. Pertussis or whooping cough causes coughing fits that can last for many weeks. A coughing adolescent can easily spread it to an infant who have the most severe and sometimes fatal cases of pertussis. The Tdap vaccine also provides protection against tetanus and diphtheria. The HPV vaccine protects against the the types of human papillomavirus that cause most cervical cancers. Are the vaccines safe? Vaccines are safe and effective. Before any vaccine is licensed and {{made available to the}} public, it must be extensively studied and the FDA must approve it as safe and effective. Side effects of the vaccines are usually mild, such as a sore arm. How do I pay for the vaccine? If you have health insurance, all or most of the cost is usually covered.

40|$|Meningococcal lipopoly(oligo) {{saccharide}} (LOS) {{is a major}} {{inflammatory mediator}} of fulminant <b>meningococcal</b> sepsis and <b>meningitis.</b> Highly purified wild-type meningococcal LOS and LOS from genetically defined mutants of Neisseria meningitidis that contained specific mutations in LOS biosynthesis pathways were used to confirm that meningococcal LOS activation of macrophages was CD 14 /Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) -MD- 2 dependent and to elucidate the LOS structural requirement for TLR 4 activation. Expression of TLR 4 but not TLR 2 was required, and antibodies to both TLR 4 and CD 14 blocked meningococcal LOS activation of macrophages. Meningococcal LOS α or β chain oligosaccharide structure did not influence CD 14 /TLR 4 -MD- 2 activation. However, meningococcal lipid A, expressed by meningococci with defects in 3 -deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid (KDO) biosynthesis or transfer, resulted in an ∼ 10 -fold (P < 0. 0001) reduction in biologic activity compared to KDO 2 -containing meningococcal LOS. Removal of KDO 2 from LOS by acid hydrolysis also dramatically attenuated cellular responses. Competitive inhibition assays showed similar binding of glycosylated and unglycosylated lipid A to CD 14 /TLR 4 -MD- 2. A {{decrease in the number}} of lipid A phosphate head groups or penta-acylated meningococcal LOS modestly attenuated biologic activity. Meningococcal endotoxin is a potent agonist of the macrophage CD 14 /TLR 4 -MD- 2 receptor, helping explain the fulminant presentation of <b>meningococcal</b> sepsis and <b>meningitis.</b> KDO 2 linked to meningococcal lipid A was structurally required for maximal activation of the human macrophage TLR 4 pathway and indicates an important role for KDO-lipid A in endotoxin biologic activity...|$|R
