50|$|With {{the loss}} of all power to the lights and flight {{altitude}} instruments, flying at night in instrument conditions, the pilots quickly became spatially disorientated and unable to know which inputs to the flight controls were necessary to keep the plane flying normally.

The speed control of MDPS (in our case is a triple drive system) based on multivariable PID is more proficient in improving the speed loop response stability, the steady state error is reduced, the rising time is perfected and the disturbances do not affect the performances of driving motors with no overtaking...|$|R

40|$|The <b>mechanical</b> <b>line</b> being {{developed}} at Los Alamos is designed around the peroxide precipitation process.

The process for converting the peroxide to a reducible fluoride is known. From the reduction step on, no change is necessary in the present process. The possibilities of a satisfactory peroxide process were recognized before design and construction of the R. G. Line, but the development work necessary for this process had not progressed far enough to have been included in that line. The gain to be realized by the adoption of the peroxide method is so great that the amount of work necessary for development of this process can certainly be justified at this time. Advantages of this process are summarized and it is recommended that serious consideration be given to using the peroxide process before design of the R. M. Line goes further...|$|R
40|$|Manufacturing {{flexibility}} can {{be generally}} defined as system ability to counter {{external and internal}} changes rapidly and cost-effectively. This concept {{has become a major}} issue for survival and development of firms operating in <b>mechanical</b> manufacturing <b>line</b> of business, and {{also one of the most}} effective leverages to attain the desired system performances both in terms of product quantities, costs and quality. This paper deals with the practical assessment of flexibility indexes in real manufacturing system; the aim being to investigate which and how commonly available manufacturing data can be used for this purpose, rather then proposing further theoretical measures to a well established framework. A careful literature review and the analysis of common data available have in fact pointed out that flexibility measures can be often determined only as a result of massive, expensive and ad hoc data collection campaigns. On the other hand, general manufacturing and costs available data, such as production mix, bill of materials, manufacturing and assembly cycles, ABC sales, and main costs elements, may anyway be helpful in evaluating some flexibility dimensions [1]. These themes have been empirically tested and experienced through the analysis of a real manufacturing case represented by a firm producing pneumatic equipment for automation. The case, for the issues presented, can be considered representative of how flexibility indexes, particularly machine flexibility one, can be built in modern firms of <b>mechanical</b> <b>line</b> of business. Main outcomes underline how meaningful and useful flexibility parameters can be determined using system common manufacturing data...|$|R

40|$|A new {{normalized}} coupling synchronization (NCS) {{method is}} proposed {{to solve the}} problem of synchronizing the speeds of all wheels in a multi‐axis independent driving system without mechanical transmission connection. The NCS method integrates normalizing and coupling techniques by emulating <b>mechanical</b> <b>line</b> shaft. All wheelsʹ speeds are normalized, and thus can be synchronized whether the wheelʹs revolution speeds are the same or different. Then, all of the normalized wheel speeds are coupled in order to eliminate speed synchronization errors between any pair of axes. Therefore, the new algorithm is able to achieve global speed synchronization. It is applicable to multi‐ axis driving vehicles either driving in straight line or making a turn. The conducted computational simulation shows that the proposed method gets better result in reducing speed synchronization errors in both cases of same and different wheel speeds compared to some classic speed sync methods in the literature. To further validate the effectiveness and applicability of the NCS method, it is also applied to a four‐wheel‐driving and four‐wheel‐steering vehicle for comparison tests. The onboard tests indicate that the proposed method achieves a fast convergence of speed error...|$|R
