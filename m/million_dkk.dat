25|$|With the {{security}} situation in Somalia improved, the Danish Foreign Ministry launched its new development policy in 2011 based on active diplomacy, security, governance, living standards, growth and employment. Within this official framework, the Danish government engaged Somalia's constituent autonomous regions, including Puntland, Somaliland and South Central Somalia, through the Interpeace programmes on democratisation, peace and women's engagement. It also established and funded the Somaliland Fund for the Somaliland regional administration's key areas. Additionally, local governance accountability and transparency were supported through JPLG, as well as gender equality via the UNDP. In terms of growth and employment, Denmark supported enabling business sector environment and fisheries and gums/resins value chains via the World Bank PSD programme in Puntland and Somaliland.

5|$|The airline started {{negotiating}} a charter contract {{agreement with the}} Danish tour operator Spies Rejser in July 1970. Trans Polar offered the operator the use of two Boeing 720s for 55 <b>million</b> Danish krone (<b>DKK),</b> 10 <b>million</b> lower than the incumbent Scanair was bidding, which would allow Spies to transport 140,000 of their annual 250,000 passengers. As the first aircraft was bound to existing operations, Trans Polar would have to procure two additional aircraft for the contract, as well as receive operating permission in Denmark. Trans Polar and Spies signed a contract in mid-August for one weekly service from Copenhagen to Gran Canaria, while another weekly contract was awarded to Maersk Air. Negotiations for the main contract started on 5 September; Scanair had stated a minimum price it could accept, largely {{based on the fact}} that Spies did not have an alternative operator. The successful negotiations with Trans Polar also included an agreement with Spantax, who each could offer Spies 70,000 seats for the season. The contract brought annual revenue of DKK25 million to Trans Polar. To fly the operations, two ex-Aer Lingus Boeing 720s were registered on 16 October.

40|$|Introduction: Renin-angiotensin {{inhibitor}} {{drugs have}} been a target for health authority initiatives across Europe {{with the potential for}} substantial savings once generic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) became available without compromising care. Recently, losartan was the first angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) to lose its patent. In Denmark, the authorities removed all other ARBs from the reimbursement list, apart from losartan, as they were all seen as essentially similar for the management of hypertension or congestive heart failure at appropriate doses, but more expensive. Similarly, all other ARB fixed-dose combinations (FDCs), apart from losartan, were removed from the reimbursement list. Objective: The aims of the study were to (i) assess the impact of these reimbursement changes on the subsequent utilisation of losartan and other ARBs alone or as FDCs; (ii) assess changes in the prices of losartan and other ARBs post-generic losartan to calculate potential savings; and (iii) compare the impact of the policies in Denmark with other European countries to provide guidance. Methodology: This was a retrospective segmented regression analysis of an interrupted time-series design comparing utilisation patterns before and after the changes in ARB reimbursement status. Utilisation was measured in defined daily doses (DDDs). Changes in total expenditure and expenditure/DDD were also assessed over time. Results: Losartan utilisation grew from 31 to 33 % of total single ARB utilisation before generic losartan, to 93 % by October 2011. There was a corresponding decrease in the utilisation of all other ARBs. Both changes were significant (p < 0. 001). Total expenditure on single ARBs in 2011 was 77 % below 2009 levels despite a 16 % increase in utilisation. Estimated savings were 290. 5 <b>million</b> Danish Kroner (<b>DKK).</b> A similar trend was seen for losartan FDCs, which was also significant (p < 0. 001). Discussion: Losartan utilisation grew appreciable following the changes. The change was much greater than seen in countries that had eased prescribing restrictions for losartan but not the other ARBs. Active therapeutic switching programmes plus education and financial incentives also significantly enhanced losartan utilisation following generics in two countries and regions; however, the increase in losartan utilisation was less than that seen in Denmark. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland...|$|R
