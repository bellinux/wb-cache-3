50|$|The {{extent to}} which the {{deterrence}} argument is well-founded, however, is far from the only interesting and important aspect of this common justification of capital punishment. In fact, current conceptualizations of the deterrence argument are also paramount, insofar as they implicitly operate under the assumption that the media and publicity are integral to shaping individuals' awareness and understandings of capital punishment. In other words, current conceptualizations of the deterrence argument presuppose that most people are made aware of executions through the <b>media's</b> <b>coverage</b> of said executions, which means that the media's selection of executions to cover, as well as the <b>media's</b> <b>coverage</b> of said executions are necessary for the deterrence effect to transpire. In this regard, in contemporary society, the deterrence argument relies upon the implicit understanding that people's understandings and actions - including actions that may deprive an individual of life - are influenced by the media. Although it is increasingly unclear {{as to whether or not}} the <b>media's</b> <b>coverage</b> has affected criminal behavior, it is necessary to examine how the <b>media's</b> <b>coverage</b> of executions and, more abstractly, its holistic construction of capital punishment has shaped people's actions and understandings related to this controversial practice.|$|R

40|$|The year 2011 was memorable {{for many}} in India – for {{those who participated in}} {{numerous}} anti-corruption protests, and for those who witnessed these protests via all pervasive mainstream news media. This paper will use inter-media agenda-setting discourse to explain the Indian <b>media’s</b> <b>coverage</b> of the so-called ‘Anna movement’. It will outline how the use of mobile and social media platforms by the ‘India Against Corruption’ organisers and the educated middle class influenced the mainstream <b>media’s</b> <b>coverage</b> of the protests. The paper will consider the implication of this coverage, {{in the light of the}} unique position of power the Indian news media has in this transitioning society...|$|R

[...] The Victorian Premier said the Indian <b>media's</b> <b>coverage</b> of the incidents was [...] "unbalanced" [...] and emphasised that two Indian nationals were charged with the murder of Jaspreet Singh.

40|$|The {{title is}} {{a quote from}} a blog entry written by the Swedish {{journalist}} Linus Fremin. For many years Fremin suffered from bulimia and he claims that men {{for a long time}} have been excluded from <b>medias</b> <b>coverage</b> of eating disorders. We wanted to try this thesis and decided to do a quantitative study of articles published in two Swedish newspapers, Aftonbladet and Dagens Nyheter, regarding eating disorders during the period 20101129 - 20121129. We studied 199 articles and counted the occurrence {{of men and women in}} the texts. Our study showed that women were represented in a majority of the articles, whereas the men were clearly much more absent. In most of the articles eating disorders were described as a female issue and men were rarely included. It’s difficult to say how the ideal division of men and women in <b>media’s</b> <b>coverage</b> of eating disorders should look like. Perhaps the ideal to strive for is not “fifty-fifty”, since more women than men today are diagnosed with an eating disorder. But it is important to know that this exclusion of men in <b>media’s</b> <b>coverage</b> of eating disorders contributes to the public opinion that eating disorders is an non-issue among men. ...|$|R
