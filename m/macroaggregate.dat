However, the knowledge of the sources of mineralization and PE in aggregate size classes is absent. We applied the three-source-partitioning isotopic (C- 14 + delta C- 13) approach to determine how aggregate size classes affect the contribution of three C sources (substrate added, recent and old SOM) to CO 2 efflux and PE depending on the amount of added primer. Soil from a field with 3 years of maize cropping (C- 4 plants) after long-term C- 3 vegetation was used to differentiate between recent C (C- 4 -C; 3 years). Soil samples were separated into three aggregate size classes (> 2 mm, 2 - 0. 25 mm <b>macroaggregates</b> and 2 mm), but was observed in both <b>macroaggregates</b> (> 0. 25 mm) and microaggregates (< 0. 25 mm) after high glucose amendment. These results indicate that SOM pools are more decomposable in macro-versus microaggregates and that the SOM pools are involved in PE according to their biochemical availability. More primed CO 2 originated from recent C- 4 -C than old C- 3 -C in larger <b>macroaggregates</b> under a low glucose level. The relative contribution of recent C- 4 -C to primed CO 2 increased from <b>macroaggregates</b> (37. 8 %) to microaggregates (100 %) after high glucose amendment. Therefore, increasing glucose addition stimulated the decomposition of old C- 3 -C in <b>macroaggregates,</b> but not in microaggregates. This indicates that microaggregates protect SOM against decomposition better than <b>macroaggregates,</b> and consequently, microaggregates can be considered as a potential reservoir for longterm C sequestration. Concluding, aggregate size is crucial for SOM decomposition, and it determines the source of PE and thus the protection of sequestrated C. The effects of the added primer on C sources involved in PE depend on the aggregate size. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

A field experiment comparing permanent and tilled raised beds with different residue management under rainfed conditions was started at El Batán (State of Mexico, Mexico) in 1999. The percentage of small and large <b>macroaggregates</b> and mean weight diameter (MWD) was significantly larger in permanent raised beds compared to conventionally tilled raised beds both with full crop residue retention (average for maize and wheat), while the percentages free microaggregates was lower. The percentages of small and large <b>macroaggregates</b> and mean weight diameter (MWD) was significantly larger in permanent raised beds with residue retention compared to permanent raised beds with removal of the residue (average for maize and wheat), while the percentages free microaggregates and silt and clay fraction was lower. Cultivation of maize significantly reduced the large <b>macroaggregates,</b> while wheat reduced the silt and clay fraction (average over all systems). Cultivation of maize reduced the C and N content of the free microaggregates compared to soil cultivated with wheat, while removal of plant residue reduced the C and N content of the silt and clay fraction compared to soil where residue was retained. The C and N content of the coarse particulate organic matter (cPOM) and microaggregates within the <b>macroaggregates</b> was significantly larger in permanent raised beds compared to conventionally tilled raised beds both with full residue retention, while C and N content of the cPOM was significantly lower when residue was removed or partially removed compared to the soil where the residue was retained.

Twelve patients with clinically evident brain tumours received carotid or vertebral injections of <b>macroaggregates.</b> Ten had histologically proved tumours, and six of these were correctly localized by external scanning. The quality of the scans was not superior to that obtained with other tracers currently in use. Because four patients developed transient neurological complications that could be attributed to the procedure, the clinical pilot study was terminated...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1900 s, {{the link}} between soil biotic activity, soil organic matter (SOM) {{decomposition}} and stabilization, and soil aggregate dynamics has been recognized and intensively been studied. By 1950, many studies had, mostly qualitatively, investigated {{the influence of the}} five major factors (i. e. soil fauna, microorganisms, roots, inorganics and physical processes) on this link. After 1950, four theoretical mile-stones related to this subject were realized. The first one was when Emerson [Nature 183 (1959) 538] proposed a model of a soil crumb consisting of domains of oriented clay and quartz particles. Next, Edwards and Bremner [J. Soil Sci. 18 (1967) 64] formulated a theory in which the solid-phase reaction between clay minerals, polyvalent cations and SOM is the main process leading to microaggregate formation. Based on this concept, Tisdall and Oades [J. Soil Sci. 62 (1982) 141] coined the aggregate hierarchy concept describing a spatial scale dependence of mechanisms involved in micro- and <b>macroaggregate</b> formation. Oades [Plant Soil 76 (1984) 319] suggested a small, but very important, modification to the aggregate hierarchy concept by theorizing the formation of microaggregates within macroaggregates. Recent research on aggregate formation and SOM stabilization extensively corroborate this modification and use it as the base for furthering the understanding of SOM dynamics. The major outcomes of adopting this modification are: (1) microaggregates, rather than macroaggregates protect SOM in the long term; and (2) <b>macroaggregate</b> turnover is a crucial process influencing the stabilization of SOM. Reviewing the progress made over the last 50 years in this area o...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Motile chick {{skeletal}} fibroblasts {{adhere to}} a laminin substrate by means of clustered/ 3 ~ integrins. These integfin "macroaggregates " are similar to classic focal contacts but do not appear dark under interference-reflection microscopy. They contain ~ 5 integrin and are associated with extracellular fibronectin. To study their behavior during cell movement, time-lapse, low-light video microscopy was used to image integrins on living cells tagged with a fluorescent anti-#~ integrin antibody. Integrin macroaggregates remain fixed {{with respect to the}} substratum, {{despite the fact that they}} fluctuate in size, density, and shape over a period of minutes. Upon detachment of the cell rear, as much as 85 % of the ~ integrin density of a <b>macroaggregate</b> remain...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We have {{previously}} reported that high-density lipoprotein (HDL) exhibits antineuritogenic effects on chicken cerebral cells in culture. In the present study, we show {{the effects of}} HDL 5, oxidized by UV irradiation or heating, on chicken cerebral neurons in culture. Both treatments produced several physical and chemical changes in the HDLs, i. e., formation of lipid peroxides, enlargement of HDL diameters, an increased exposure of the tryptophan groups of the apolipoprotein A-I to a more hydrophilic environment, formation of bityrosines, and cross-linking of apolipoprotein A-I. When these treat-ments were performed {{in the absence of}} EDTA, most of the modifications described above were more intense and HDLs formed a <b>macroaggregate</b> that displays a ro-sette-like structure.

40|$|The {{importance}} of {{particulate organic matter}} (POM) in the soil ecosystem has been emphasized by many researchers, but the dynamics of POM {{and its role in}} aggregate formation are not well understood. I concluded a simulated no-till experiment which utilized 14 C labeled plant material, periodic sampling, and a combination of physical and chemical fractionation methods to measure progressive changes in aggregation and the distribution of new POM C as surface residue and in situ roots decomposed. The main objectives of this dissertation were: (i) to characterize the relative contribution of surface residue- and root-derived C to soil organic matter (SOM) under no-till; (ii) to compare the concentration of new POM C in aggregates of different size and stability; (iii) to quantify changes with time in the amount, concentration, and distribution of surface residue- and root-derived C in free and intraaggregate POM;After one year, 66 % of the 14 C contained in surface residue on d 0 had been respired as CO 2, 12 % of the 14 C remained in residue on the soil surface, and 16 % of the 14 C was in the soil. In contrast, 56 % of the root-derived 14 C was respired as CO 2 and 44 % of the 14 C remained in the soil after one year. The concentration of root-derived POM 14 C was significantly higher in stable (slaked) compared to less stable (capillary wetted) <b>macroaggregates,</b> but {{there was no difference in}} the concentration of surface residue-derived POM 14 C in stable compared to unstable <b>macroaggregates.</b> The disruption of <b>macroaggregates</b> during the first 90 d of the incubation resulted in the release of root-derived intraaggregate POM into the free POM pool. After d 90, most of the root-derived C lost from <b>macroaggregates</b> with slaking was contained within microaggregates. The amount of new, root-derived C associated with microaggregates released from <b>macroaggregates</b> with slaking increased linearly with time which supports the hypothesis that microaggregates form within <b>macroaggregates.</b> The data present compelling evidence that in no-till, aggregate formation and stabilization processes are directly related to the decomposition of root-residue and the dynamics of POM C in the soil...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{aggregation}} {{and development}} of soil structure {{play a crucial role}} in determining soil functions and ecosystem services in Earth's Critical Zone. Soil organic matter (SOM) is the main constituent that binds mineral particles together into larger-sized aggregates. Many theoretical concepts have been proposed to explain soil aggregation and SOM accrual processes, but quantification of the processes remains lacking. We observed changes in aggregate size mass distribution and aggregate carbon content in 2 discrete years from an 8 -year field experiment, which was conducted to determine how to speed up soil development and restoration with different agricultural practices. The 2 -year data showed that the proportion of <b>macroaggregates</b> (> 250 μm) increased with the decreasing proportions of microaggregates (53 – 250 μm) and soil texture units (< 53 μm) and increasing proportion of particulate organic matter occluded in the <b>macroaggregates.</b> This aggregation process was more noticeable in the field treatments with higher organic carbon input. By using these data, we successfully calibrated the recently developed CAST mathematical model, which assumes that primary <b>macroaggregates</b> are first formed around plant-derived organic matter and primary microaggregates are then formed within the <b>macroaggregates</b> as the occluded organic materials are decomposed. The secondary microaggregates and <b>macroaggregates</b> are assumed to form after the breakdown of primary <b>macroaggregates.</b> The calibration processes separated the plant growth season from the frozen winter season. Some calibrated parameters were the same for all of the field treatments, and these parameters included the first-order rate constants of the fragmentation and decomposition of plant litter within the <b>macroaggregates,</b> the decomposition rates of organic matter incorporated and protected in microaggregates, and organic carbon associated with the free soil texture units. Other calibrated parameter values were affected by the field treatments, and the parameters were the first-order decay rate constants of the plant-derived organic matter in nonaggregated soils and in the secondary <b>macroaggregates,</b> the least carbon sources for the formation of the secondary <b>macroaggregates,</b> and the correction factor to adjust carbon with the mass flow of the soil texture units. The differences in the calibrated parameter values suggested that the rates of the primary macroaggregation and the secondary microaggregation were likely controlled by the intrinsic properties of the parent material rather than by the land use and agricultural practices, whereas the rates of the secondary macroaggregation process were likely affected by land use through controlling plant litter quality and quantity and by agricultural practices, such as soil tillage, and to a less extent by fertilizers that control organic input and then carbon and mass content of the soil texture units and microaggregates. The model results were consistent with measured changes over time of the aggregate mass distribution by size class, the total organic matter content, and the SOM bound in aggregates. However, the CAST model did not reproduce particularly well the mass of the soil texture units within different aggregate size classes nor the relative contribution of carbon stocks from different carbon pools within aggregates. The gap between observations and model results points the way forward to develop further the detailed process descriptions in the CAST modeling approach, for example, to consider primary microaggregation directly from basic soil texture units. Nevertheless, this study demonstrates that the CAST model is very powerful to predict the dynamics of soil aggregation and concurrent SOM change in response to changes in land use and soil management...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{microorganisms}} are {{the drivers}} of ecosystem biogeochemistry, but {{the field of}} soil ecology lags behind other biological disciplines in understanding habitat constraints driving biodiversity and ecosystem functioning of these microorganisms. One approach to characterizing habitat at the micro-scale is to subset soil into naturally occurring physical associations of particles, organic matter, and microbes called aggregates. However, classic methods of separating soil aggregates can drastically change microbial communities and activities. In this dissertation, a methodological approach to isolating soil aggregates for biological analysis is refined and then applied to evaluating microbial activity and fungal community structure in three ecosystems managed for bioenergy production. Subsequently, aggregate-scale processes are scaled out to contrast ecosystem carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling in the three ecosystems. Direct contrast of soil extracellular enzyme activities within soil aggregates isolated by traditional slaking means, dry sieving, and optimal moisture found wet sieved large <b>macroaggregates</b> (3 ̆e 2000 µm) had four times greater activity than <b>macroaggregates</b> isolated by the other methods. Very high activity in wet-sieved <b>macroaggregates</b> led to mass-proportional sums of enzyme activities to exceed 100...|$|R
