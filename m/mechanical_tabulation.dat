50|$|The census was {{conducted}} by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics formed in 1918 by the Statistics Act. Census fieldwork {{was carried out by}} 241 commissioners and 11,425 enumerators responsible for the corresponding numbers of census districts and subdistricts structured to correspond closely to federal electoral constituencies and polling subdivisions respectively. A special staff of up to 350 in Ottawa compiled the census results using <b>mechanical</b> <b>tabulation</b> methods. In 1955, the paper census schedules were destroyed after the population schedules were microfilmed.|$|E
40|$|Regarding the {{calculation}} of the differential gear appratas, this is a one method in which both {{the calculation}} of a follower when an arm is revohing as a driver is fixed and {{the calculation of}} it when a driver is revolving as an arm is none, are superposed. Author can be deduced a common law from the many kinds of differertial gear mechanism as shown in a table 1 for the former case of the above calcalation. As an application of this law, one method of <b>mechanical</b> <b>tabulation</b> is discussed in this paper. 差動歯車の計算に於ては，作表法による計算が一般に用いられているが，茲では矢張り作表法であるが別の考え方による一つの作表法を提案してみたいと思う。即ち，本稿中の計算で明な様に差動歯車の回転を分ちて，先づ原動車を固定して腕のみを原動車軸の中心のまわりに回転した場合の従動車の回転と，腕を固定した場合における原動車から伝わる従動車の回転を重ね合せたものと考えることができる...|$|E
5000|$|The first ballot marking devices {{specifically}} designed for use in elections emerged in the late 19th century along with proposals to use various punched-card ballot forms. Kennedy Dougan filed for patents on a punched-card system using a ballot marking device in 1890. [...] Urban Iles filed {{a proposal for a}} more sophisticated system in 1892. [...] The patents for these machines suggest that their primary goal was to provide for <b>mechanical</b> vote <b>tabulation</b> while retaining paper ballots {{that could be used to}} verify the operation of the tabulator in the event of any question. The punched cards used by these early machines were not designed to be compatible with any other data processing equipment.|$|R

40|$|The {{economic}} censuses reflect growing {{industrialization and}} the spread of communications in the United States since the early 19 th century. Temporary organizations took these censuses with increasing detail almost every 10 years from 1810 to 1900. Demands for more frequent enumerations and current data were major factors in the establishment of a permanent census office in 1902. The 20 th century features censuses of manufactures every two years and later at five-year intervals, construction industries; mineral industries; minority- and women-owned businesses; retail and wholesale trades; service industries; financial, insurance, and real estate industries; truck inventory and use survey; commodity flow survey; transportation, communications and utilities. In the 1950 s, the censuses were integrated to ensure complete, unduplicated, comparable data for all of their components. Enumeration was increasingly by mail and, for small establishments, by the use of administrative records in lieu of returns. The introduction of <b>mechanical,</b> electronic <b>tabulation,</b> and computers and CD-ROMs increased the variety of data products available and how the information could be accessed. The most recent 1 quinquennial economic census, for the year 1992, 2 covered retail trade; wholesale trade; service industries; transportation, communications, and utilities; finance, insurance, and real estate; construction industries, manufactures, and mineral industries...|$|R
