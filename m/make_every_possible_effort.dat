Although the trouble was highly localized, the country seemed to be overrun by gangs of soldiers and looters. This caused a media sensation, which highlighted the Europeans fleeing the country. In response, Lumumba announced over the radio, [...] "Thoroughgoing reforms are planned in all sectors. My government will <b>make</b> <b>every</b> <b>possible</b> <b>effort</b> to see that our country has a different face in a few months, a few weeks." [...] In spite of the government's efforts, the mutinies continued. Mutineers in Leopoldville and Thysville surrendered only upon the personal intervention of Lumumba and President Kasa-Vubu. On 8 July, {{in an attempt to}} alleviate the situation, Lumumba renamed the Force Publique as the [...] "Armée Nationale Congolaise" [...] (ANC). He Africanized the force by appointing Sergeant Major Victor Lundula to be General and Commander-in-chief while also choosing junior minister and former soldier Joseph Mobutu to be Colonel and Chief of staff of the army. These promotions were made in spite of Lundula's inexperience and rumours about Mobutu's ties with Belgian and American intelligence services. All other European officers were replaced, with a few being retained as advisers. By the next day the mutinies had spread throughout the entire country. Five Europeans, including the Italian vice-consul, were ambushed and killed by machine gun fire in Élisabethville and nearly the entire European population of Luluabourg barricaded itself in an office building for safety. An estimated two dozen Europeans were murdered in the mutiny. Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu embarked on a tour across the country to promote peace and appoint new ANC commanders.|$|E

5000|$|In all the {{decisions}} I have made in my public life, I have always tried {{to do what was}} best for the Nation. Throughout the long and difficult period of Watergate, I have felt it was my duty to persevere, to <b>make</b> <b>every</b> <b>possible</b> <b>effort</b> to complete the term of office to which you elected me. In the past few days, however, it has become evident to me that I no longer have a strong enough political base in the Congress to justify continuing that effort. As long as there was such a base, I felt strongly that it was necessary to see the constitutional process through to its conclusion, that to do otherwise would be unfaithful to the spirit of that deliberately difficult process and a dangerously destabilizing precedent for the future….I would have preferred to carry through to the finish whatever the personal agony it would have involved, and my family unanimously urged me to do so. But the interest of the Nation must always come before any personal considerations. From the discussions I have had with Congressional and other leaders, I have concluded that because of the Watergate matter I might not have the support of the Congress that I would consider necessary to back the very difficult decisions and carry out the duties of this office in the way the interests of the Nation would require.I have never been a quitter. To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body. But as President, I must put the interest of America first. America needs a full-time President and a full-time Congress, particularly at this time with problems we face at home and abroad. To continue to fight through the months ahead for my personal vindication would almost totally absorb the time and attention of both the President and the Congress in a period when our entire focus should be on the great issues of peace abroad and prosperity without inflation at home. Therefore, I shall resign the Presidency effective at noon tomorrow. Vice President Ford will be sworn in as President at that hour in this office.|$|E

50|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity {{at risk of}} life {{above and}} beyond the call of duty, in action on the western ridge of Mount Altuzzo, Italy. After bitter fighting his company had advanced to within 50 yards of the objective, where it was held up due to intense enemy sniper, automatic, small arms, and mortar fire. The enemy launched 3 desperate counterattacks in an effort to regain their former positions, but all 3 were repulsed with heavy casualties on both sides. All officers and noncommissioned officers of the 2d and 3d platoons of Company B had become casualties, and S/Sgt. Keathley, guide of the 1st platoon, moved up and assumed command of both the 2d and 3d platoons, reduced to 20 men. The remnants of the 2 platoons were dangerously low on ammunition, so S/Sgt. Keathley, under deadly small arms and mortar fire, crawled from 1 casualty to another, collecting their ammunition and administering first aid. He then visited each man of his 2 platoons, issuing the precious ammunition he had collected from the dead and wounded, and giving them words of encouragement. The enemy now delivered their fourth counterattack, which was approximately 2 companies in strength. In a furious charge they attacked from the front and both flanks, throwing hand grenades, firing automatic weapons, and assisted by a terrific mortar barrage. So strong was the enemy counterattack that the company was given up for lost. The remnants of the 2d and 3d platoons of Company B were now looking to S/Sgt. Keathley for leadership. He shouted his orders precisely and with determination and the men responded with all that was in them. Time after time the enemy tried to drive a wedge into S/Sgt. Keathley's position and each time they were driven back, suffering huge casualties. Suddenly an enemy hand grenade hit and exploded near S/Sgt. Keathley, inflicting a mortal wound in his left side. However, hurling defiance at the enemy, he rose to his feet. Taking his left hand away from his wound and using it to steady his rifle, he fired and killed an attacking enemy soldier, and continued shouting orders to his men. His heroic and intrepid action so inspired his men that they fought with incomparable determination and viciousness. For 15 minutes S/Sgt. Keathley continued leading his men and effectively firing his rifle. He could have sought a sheltered spot and perhaps saved his life, but instead he elected to set an example for his men and <b>make</b> <b>every</b> <b>possible</b> <b>effort</b> to hold his position. Finally, friendly artillery fire helped to force the enemy to withdraw, leaving behind many of their number either dead or seriously wounded. S/Sgt. Keathley died a few moments later. Had it not been for his indomitable courage and incomparable heroism, the remnants of 3 rifle platoons of Company B might well have been annihilated by the overwhelming enemy attacking force. His actions were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service.|$|E

40|$|Narcotic {{drugs and}} psychotropic substances still remain {{indispensable}} in medicine.  One {{of the top}} priorities of health care is to ensure the required availability of this group of drugs. The development of an effective system which can ensure crucially important availability of narcotic and psychotropic agents to people who need them for medical purposes must rely on the identification and analysis {{of the nature and}} specificity of the problems related to them as well as the ways of solving these problems. The Purpose of the Study was to explore the constituents of the system ensuring medicinal availability of narcotic and psychotropic agents and to identify the factors hindering the availability of this group of medicinal agents. Materials and Methods. The study involved the systematic review analysis of the scientific publications and guidance  documents regulating various aspects of activities involving the turnover of controlled drugs, and the results of surveys and interviews in which medical and pharmaceutical professionals were engaged. The study employed the methods of content analysis, logical and functional analysis, etc. Results and Discussion. The system of narcotic and psychotropic drug (NPD) availability for patients who need them is currently going through reforms which have been conditioned by low accessibilty of these drugs when used for medical purposes. Those engaged in the drug supply system including medical and pharmaceutical professionals point out that excessive bureaucratization of the system of NPD supply and availability, complexity of documentation and paperwork reporting thedrug flow, costliness of these activities, and strict liability account for low availability of such drugs. To ensure the rights of the citizens to relieve pain due to diseases or medical interventions, a number of changes in the laws and regulations have been made. They have simplified the requirements for NPD turnover in regard to administering, prescribing and dispensing the drugs. However, the findings of the studies which have been conducted demonstrate that the massive reforms of the regulatory framework aiming to change the situation are not actually implemented. The specialists involved in the field prefer not to enforce new laws and <b>make</b> <b>every</b> <b>possible</b> <b>effort</b> to avoid using new regulations instead and search for the opportunities either to minimize the activities involving controlled medicinal agentsor to refuse them altogether. In this situation, patients who need opioid analgesics, even within a favourable regulatory framework, are facing a lot of problems when the drugs are prescribed or dispersed. Сonclusions : In this case, a solution of the problem of low availability of NPD must involve the improvement of administrative management of the availability system at the level of medical and pharmaceutical organizations. </p...|$|E
