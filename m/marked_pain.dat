50|$|The {{hallmark}} of polymyositis is weakness and/or loss of muscle {{mass in the}} proximal musculature, as well as flexion of the neck and torso. These symptoms {{can be associated with}} <b>marked</b> <b>pain</b> in these areas as well. The hip extensors are often severely affected, leading to particular difficulty in ascending stairs and rising from a seated position. The skin involvement of dermatomyositis is absent in polymyositis. Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) or other problems with esophageal motility occur in as many as 1/3 of patients. Low grade fever and peripheral adenopathy may be present. Foot drop in one or both feet can be a symptom of advanced polymyositis and inclusion body myositis. The systemic involvement of polymyositis includes interstitial lung disease and cardiac disease, such as heart failure and conduction abnormalities.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to analyze the {{effectiveness}} of non-tension and traditional hernioplasty techniques in abdominal hernias of various localizations taking into account the postoperative period peculiarities, the frequency of postoperative complications and recurrences. Materials and methods. There have been analyzed the results of surgical treatment in 348 patients with hernias of various localization. In 268 of them there has been performed hernioplasty using meshed endoprosthesis (the main group), and in 80 of them — using traditional technique (control group). Conclusion. Non-tension hernioplasty techniques have a number of essential advantages compared to traditional ones. The advantages are the following: absence of a <b>marked</b> <b>pain</b> syndrome in postoperative period, lack of the necessity to administer narcotic preparations, the decrease of powerful analgesic administration, shortening of hospitalization period. In any hernia localization, atension plasty is less traumatic and can be performed under spinal or local anesthesia.

40|$|Abstract Background In oncologic {{patients}} with metastatic spinal disease, the ideal treatment should be well tolerated, relieve the pain, and preserve or restore the neurological function. The combination of fluoroscopic guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and kyphoplasty may fulfill these criteria. Methods We describe three pathological vertebral fractures {{treated with a}} combination of fluoroscopic guided RFA and kyphoplasty in one session: a 62 -year-old man suffering from a painful L 4 pathological fracture due to a plasmocytoma, a 68 -year-old man with a T 12 pathological fracture from metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma, and a 71 -year-old man with a Th 12 and L 1 pathological fracture from multiple myeloma. Results The choice of patients was carried out according to the classification of Tomita. Visual analog score (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI) were used for the evaluation of the functional outcomes. The treatment was successful in all patients and no complications were reported. The mean follow-up was 6 months. <b>Marked</b> <b>pain</b> relief and functional restoration was observed. Conclusion In our experience the treatment of pathologic spinal fractures with combined radiofrequency ablation and balloon kyphoplasty is safe and effective for immediate pain relief in painful spinal lesions in neurologically intact patients. </p...|$|E
40|$|Femoral pseudo-aneurysm (FPA) is a pulsatile hematoma (false aneurysm) of the {{femoral artery}} that {{communicates}} with an artery through a disruption in the arterial wall. Most often, FPA develops after an injury or angiographic {{access to the}} femoral artery with bleeding into the adjacent tissue. FPA is an uncommon complication, but a very significant one, that can have serious consequences. FPA can initially present as a new thrill or bruit, a pulsatile hematoma, or <b>marked</b> <b>pain</b> and tenderness {{near the site of}} arterial puncture. Doppler flow imaging has been the mainstay of diagnosis. Ultrasound (US) -guided compression was the treatment of choice. However, it carries drawbacks including length of time to compress for adequate closure of the artery, discomfort to patients, high recurrence rate in patients receiving anticoagulation, femoral artery thrombosis, and a success rate of only 75 % overall. (1, 2) An alternative to compression is US-guided thrombin injection (UGTI) of the FPA. This is a safe procedure that can be done as an outpatient or in an office setting. This paper will provide nursing guidelines and rationale as well as a nursing protocol for the management of patients who undergo UGTI for FPA...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It is {{uncertain}} whether analgesic effects of vertebroplasty {{in patients with}} painful VCF are actually attributable to intervertebral cement infusion. This study aims to assess the validity of cement infusion performed for pain relief based on {{the presence or absence}} of pseudoarthrosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared therapeutic effects between PVP and vertebral perforation without bone cement infusion in patients with painful VCF. The subjects were 64 patients undergoing PVP (PVP group) and 67 undergoing vertebral perforation (perforation group). In all patients, preoper-ative dynamic radiography was performed to assess the presence of vertebral mobility. Patients were classified into 2 groups, those with and those without vertebral mobility, and changes in VAS and ADL scores before and after surgery were compared between the PVP and perforation groups. RESULTS: Regarding patients with vertebral mobility, VAS improved during the 3 months immediately after surgery in the PVP group compared with the perforation group (P. 05). Although no significant difference in postoperative ADL scores was observed between the 2 treatment groups, the scores 3 months after surgery were better in the PVP group than in the perforation group.

40|$|Background : A {{full-thickness}} {{soft tissue}} defect closure often needs complex procedures. The use of dermal templates {{can be helpful}} in improving the outcome. Objective : The objective was to evaluate a sandwich technique combining the dermal collagen-elastin matrix with skin grafts in a one-stage procedure. Materials and Methods : Twenty-three patients with 27 wounds were enrolled in this prospective single-centre observational study. The mean age was 74. 8 ± 17. 2 years. Included were full-thickness defects with exposed bone, cartilage and/ or tendons. The dermal collagen-elastin matrix was applied onto the wound bed accomplished by skin transplants, i. e. ′sandwich′ transplantation. In six wounds, the transplants were treated with intermittent negative pressure therapy. Results : The size of defects was ≤ 875 cm 2. The use of the dermal template resulted in a complete and stable granulation in 100 % of wounds. Seventeen defects showed a complete closure and 19 achieved a complete granulation with an incomplete closure. There was a <b>marked</b> <b>pain</b> relief. No adverse events were noted due to the dermal template usage.

40|$|Background:Theadrenal gland isacommonsiteofextrahepaticmetastases fromhepatocellular carcinoma. However, it {{has been}} the subject of few studies, and the optimal {{treatment}} remains unclear. Methods previously tried for the management of adrenal gland metastasis of hepatocel-lular carcinoma included surgical resection, transarterial chemoembolization or percutaneous ethanol injection, on the basis of case reports. External beam radiation therapy has seldom been applied for patients with adrenal gland metastases. Methods: We retrospectively studied 22 patients with adrenal metastases from hepatocellular carcinomawhowere treatedwith limited-field external beam radiation therapy. The radiation dose to the adrenal lesion ranged from 36 to 54 (median 50) Gy, while the intrahepatic lesions were treated with either surgical resection or transarterial chemoembolization. Results: Among the 14 patients who had pain related to adrenal metastases, 11 (78. 6 %) had complete pain relief without medication that lasted until death. Two (14. 3 %) patients had <b>marked</b> <b>pain</b> relief, but still required analgesics. Partial responses were observed in 73 % of the patients. The median survival period for all patients was 10 months. No patient died from complications related to adrenal metastasis. Adverse effects were mild.

40|$|Stressful stimuli can {{activate}} the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal-axis and the endogenous opioid system. In addition, corticosterone and opioid release might cause analgesia. This rat study used adrenalectomy for corticosterone withdrawal and naloxone administration for opioid antagonism {{in order to}} study pain behavior and hypophyseal hormone release in the plasma after a formalin test. Twelve days before the formalin testing, male Sprague Dawley rats underwent adrenalectomy or sham-adrenalectomy, and non-operated rats were used as reference. The number of flinches and the duration of licking or biting behavior were measured during the early and late phase. In reference and sham-operated rats, injection of formalin 5 % resulted in a <b>marked</b> <b>pain</b> behavior in the early and late phase with significant increases in ACTH and corticosterone plasma levels. In adrenalectomized rats, pain behavior was decreased during both phases. Naloxone, administered before the late phase, did not alter pain behavior in sham or reference rats, whereas in adrenalectomized rats pain reactivity returned to those levels observed in reference rats. Beta-endorphin plasma levels above the detection limit were more frequently found in adrenalectomized rats. Thyrotropin and prolactin levels were not different between studied groups. We speculate that the observed reduced pain behavior in adrenalectomized rats after formalin, {{is the result of}} an increased production of pro-opiomelanocortin, the pro-drug of both adrenocorticotrophic hormone and beta-endorphin...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{retrospective}} study was to evalu-ate the clinical and radiological outcome of bilateral sacroiliac joint (SIJ) fusion, using a new technique, in patients with a chronic SIJ syndrome. Seventeen patients with chronic low back pain, with a positive response to specific diagnostic tests for the SIJ, were considered candidates for bilateral sacroil-iac fusion. The surgical indication {{was based on the}} results of local anaesthetic joint infiltration, tempo-rary external fixation or bone scan. Ten patients had had previous surgery on the lumbar spine. Bilateral posterior SIJ fusion was performed with internal fix-ation and decortication of the sacroiliac joint, using a separate approach to each joint. Local bone grafting was performed. At the time of follow-up (on average 39 months after surgery), 3 patients reported moderate or absent pain, 8 <b>marked</b> <b>pain</b> and 6 severe pain.

40|$|Objective: Most {{patients}} wear cervical braces {{regardless of}} any anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) technique for cervical disc herniation, {{even in the}} plating. We compared clinical and radiological results in patients with cervical disc herniations. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the efficacy of plate insertion during ACDF and determine if this could eliminate the need for external cervical braces after ACDF. Methods: In this study, we evaluated 67 patients treated for single level cervical disc herniation with radiculopathy. The patients were divided into two groups: 30 patients treated with ACDF using a Solis ® cage with plating who did not wear a cervical brace after the operation (Group I: Plated group), and 37 patients treated with ACDF using a Solis ® cage without plating who wore a cervical brace for 3 months (Group II: Non-plated group). Clinical outcomes were assessed using the neck disability index (NDI), and visual analogue scale (VAS) for neck and arm pain at different times after the surgery. In addition, modified MacNab’s grading criteria were used to assess the subjective patients ’ outcome at the last follow-up.

40|$|Objectives: To {{describe}} the occurrence {{and severity of}} pressure ulcers, indentation <b>marks</b> and <b>pain</b> from the extrication collar combined with headblocks. Furthermore, the influence of time, injury severity and patient characteristics {{on the development of}} pressure ulcers, indentation <b>marks</b> and <b>pain</b> was explored. Design: Observational Study Setting: Level one trauma center in the Netherlands Participants: Adult trauma patients admitted to the Emergency Department in an extrication collar combined with headblocks. Methods: Between January and December 2013, 342 patients were included. Study outcomes were incidence and severity of pressure ulcers, indentation <b>marks</b> and <b>pain.</b> The following dependent variables were collected: time in the cervical collar and headblocks, Glasgow Coma Scale, Mean Arterial Pressure, hemoglobin, Injury Severity Score, gender, age, and Body Mass Index. Results: 75. 4 % of the patients developed a category 1 and 2. 9 % a category 2 pressure ulcer. Indentation marks were observed in 221 (64. 6 %) patients; 96 (28. 1 %) had severe indentation marks. Pressure ulcers and indentation marks were observed most frequently at the back, shoulders and chest. 63. 2 % experienced pain, of which, 38. 5 % experienced severe pain. Pain was mainly located at the occiput. Female patients experienced significantly more pain (NRS > 3) compared to male patients (OR= 2. 14, 95 % CI 1. 21 - 3. 80). None of the investigated variables significantly increased the probability of developing PUs or indentation marks. Conclusions: The high incidence of category 1 pressure ulcers and severe indentation marks indicate an increased risk for pressure ulcer development and may well lead to more severe PU lesions. Pain due to the application of the extrication collar and headblocks may lead to undesirable movement (in order to relieve the pressure) or to bias clinical examination of the cervical spine. It is necessary to revise the current practice of cervical spine immobilization. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Stimulation of {{the central}} gray matter areas {{has been used for}} the {{treatment}} of chronic pain for decades. To better understand the mechanism of action of such treatment we studied the effects of stimulation of the periventricular gray (PVG) on the sensory thalamus in two patients with chronic central pain. In each case, two electrodes were implanted in the PVG (Medtronic 3389) and the ventroposterolateral thalamic nucleus (Medtronic 3387), respectively, under guidance of CT/MRI image fusion. The PVG was stimulated in the frequency range of 2 - 100 Hz in alert patients while pain was assessed using the McGill-Melzack visual analogue scale. In addition, local field potentials (FPs) were recorded from the sensory thalamus during PVG stimulation. Maximum pain relief was obtained with 5 - 25 Hz stimulation while 50 - 100 Hz made the pain worse. This suggests that pain suppression was frequency dependent. Interestingly, we detected low frequency FPs at 0. 2 - 0. 4 Hz closely associated with the pain. During 5 - 25 Hz PVG stimulation the amplitude of this potential was significantly reduced and this was associated with <b>marked</b> <b>pain</b> relief. At the higher frequencies (50 - 100 Hz) however, there was no reduction in the FPs and no pain suppression. We have found an interesting correlation between thalamic activity and chronic pain. This curious low frequency potential may provide an objective index for quantifying chronic pain, and may hold further clues to the mechanism of action of PVG stimulation...|$|E

Twenty high and 20 low hypnotically susceptible subjects participated on 5 different days. For half of each susceptibility group, Sessions 1 - 3 consisted of a baseline trial followed by an acupuncture analgesia trial. The remaining subjects had two no-treatment trials {{on each of these}} sessions. For all subjects Session 4 was a baseline followed by a hypnotic analgesia trial, and Session 5 was a repetition of the procedures followed in Sessions 1 - 3.
