25|$|Three game modes are {{included}} with the game, with two more available via downloadable content. The first game mode, Power Race, is a hybrid of both racing and combat. Players can collect powerups to give their planes different abilities. These abilities include such things as missiles, machine guns, mines, or an EMP blast. The goal is to use whatever means necessary to achieve the highest finishing rank {{at the end of}} a given race. The second mode is focused solely on racing. Entitled Speed Race, this mode omits all weapons and powerups. In their place are rings scattered throughout the course. Flying through these rings provides the plane with an extra burst of speed, and flying through multiple in succession will <b>multiply</b> <b>that</b> speed. As with Power Race the goal is to finish the race in as high a rank as possible.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are several}} {{formulas}} that viticulturist and winemakers {{can use that}} utilize the various measurements of sugar, acid and pH level. One method developed {{by researchers at the}} University of California-Davis is the Brix:TA ratio which uses the ratio of brix degrees to the TA measurements. For example, a wine with 22°Bx and [...]75 TA will have almost a 30:1 Brix:TA ratio. According to the Davis researchers, the most balanced table wines tend to have a Brix to TA ratio between 30:1 - 35:1. Another method is to multiply the pH reading by itself and then <b>multiply</b> <b>that</b> number by the Brix reading. Using this method, when white wine grapes gets close to 200 and red wine grapes close to 260, it can be a good rule of thumb of when to harvest. For example, white wine grapes have a pH of 3.3 and Brix of 20, after going through that formula they will have a finally number of 217.80 which is well within an acceptable harvest range for some winemakers.|$|E

60|$|While {{they were}} in Glasgow the party visited several of the great {{manufacturing}} establishments. They were all very much surprised at the loftiness {{of some of the}} chimneys. There was one at a great establishment, called the St. Rollox Chemical Works, which was over four hundred and thirty feet high, and Mr. George estimated that it must have been thirty or forty feet diameter at the base. If, now, you ask your father, or some friend, how high the steeple is of the nearest church to where you live, and <b>multiply</b> <b>that</b> height by the necessary number, you will get some idea of the magnitude of this prodigious column. The lightning rod, that came down the side of it in a spiral line, looked like a spider's web that had been, by chance, blown against the chimney by the wind.|$|E
60|$|In {{spite of}} Friedrich's forebodings, an {{extraordinary}} recoil, in all Anti-Friedrich affairs, ensued upon Liegnitz; everything taking the backward course, {{from which it}} hardly recovered, or indeed did not recover at all, {{during the rest of}} this Campaign. Details on the subsequent Daun-Friedrich movements--which went all aback for Daun, Daun driven into the Hills again, Friedrich hopeful to cut off his bread, and drive him quite through the Hills, and home again--are not permitted us. No human intellect in our day could busy itself with understanding these thousand-fold marchings, manoeuvrings, assaults, surprisals, sudden facings-about (retreat changed to advance); nor could the powerfulest human memory, not exclusively devoted to study the Art Military under Friedrich, remember them when understood. For soldiers, desirous not to be sham-soldiers, they are a recommendable exercise; for them I do advise Tempelhof and the excellent German Narratives and Records. But in regard to others--A sample has been given: <b>multiply</b> <b>that</b> by the ten, by the threescore and ten; let the ingenuous imagination get from it what will suffice. Our first duty here to poor readers, is to elicit from that sea of small things the fractions which are cardinal, or which give human physiognomy and memorability to it; and carefully suppress all the rest.|$|E
6000|$|My Lords, {{you have}} here his declaration, that patronage, which he avows {{to be one of}} the {{principles}} of his government, and to be the principle of the last of his acts, is worse than war, pestilence, and famine,--and that all these calamities together might not be so effectual as this patronage in wasting and destroying the country. And at what time does he tell you this? He tells it you when he himself had just wantonly destroyed an old regular establishment for the purpose of creating a new one, in which he says he was under the necessity of pensioning the members of the old establishment from motives of mere humanity. He here confesses himself to be the author of the whole mischief. [...] "I could," [...] says he, [...] "have acted better; I might have avoided desolating the country by peculation; but," [...] says he, [...] "I had sons of the first families in the kingdom of Great Britain, every one aspiring to the rapid acquisition of lacs, and this would not suffer me to do my duty." [...] I hope your Lordships will stigmatize the falsehood of this assertion. Consider, my Lords, what he has said,--two hundred and fifty men at once, and in succession, aspiring to come home in the prime of their youth with lacs. You cannot take lacs to be less than two; we cannot make a plural less than two. Two lacs make 20,000l. Then <b>multiply</b> <b>that,</b> by 252, and you will find more than 2,500,000l. to be provided for that set of gentlemen, and for the claims of patronage. Undoubtedly such a patronage is worse than the most dreadful calamities of war, and all the other causes which lead to decline of dominion.|$|E
