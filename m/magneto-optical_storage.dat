40|$|Magnetic {{conducting}} nanoparticles with reactive functional {{groups are}} attractive materials for applications in electromagnetic interference shielding, <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>storage,</b> biomedical sensing, gas and humidity sensors, flexible electronics etc. The {{objective of this}} work was to prepare carboxyl functionalized polypyrrole (PPy) nanocomposite particles having good magnetic properties. Electromagnetic PPy nanostructures, abbreviated as PPy/Î³-Fe 2 O 3, were first prepared by a chemical one-step method. In this reaction process FeCl 3 is used as an oxidant for the polymerization of pyrrole and {{as a source of}} Fe 3 + for the formation of Î³-Fe 2 O 3. The formation of Î³-Fe 2 O 3 is also aided by the initial presence of Fe 2 +, and p-toluenesulfonic acid (p-TSA) acted as a dopant. The effects of different stabilizers on the stability and morphology of PPy/Î³-Fe 2 O 3 particles were evaluated. The presence of citric acid/sodium dodecyl sulfate during chemical oxidative polymerization produced a relatively stable PPy/Î³-Fe 2 O 3 colloidal emulsion. PPy/Î³-Fe 2 O 3 /poly(methylmethacrylate-methacrylic acid) (PPy/Î³-Fe 2 O 3 /P(MMA-MAA)) nanocomposite polymer particles were then prepared by the seeded copolymerization of MMA and MAA in the presence of magnetic PPy/Î³-Fe 2 O 3 nanocomposite seed particles. The structure and morphology of the prepared nanocomposites were confirmed by different instrumental techniques such as Fourier transform IR spectroscopy, UVâvisible spectroscopy, electron micrographs, XRD and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The electrical and magnetic properties were also investigated.

40|$|Structural, {{magnetic}} and magneto-optical properties {{were investigated}} experimentally in nanostructured rare earth/Fe (rare earth=Gd, Tb, Dy), Co/Pt and Bi-doped DIG/T (T=Fe, Co, Dy and DIG=Dy-Iron-Garnet) multilayer thin films. In the rare earth/Fe system, {{it was found}} that the magnetization reversal could be correlated with the intrinsic magnetic parameters, especially the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. It was found that higher anisotropy leads to magnetization reversal primarily by domain wall motion due to the higher domain wall energy. The coercivities of these multilayers were strongly dependent on the temperature as well as magnetic field sweep rate, and a strong magnetic after effect was observed. These results demonstrate that thermal activation plays an important role in the determination of the coercivity. ^ The coercivity of Co/Pt multilayer thin films increases with increasing total thickness of the film and magnetization reversal behavior was largely by wall motion, independent of thickness. However the magnetic domain structure depends strongly on the total thickness, presumably due to subtle differences in the defect structures which pin domain walls. In agreement with other studies, {{it was found that}} magnetic polarization of the Pt atoms contributed significantly to the total magnetization and Kerr rotation at blue wavelength. ^ Amorphous DIG/Fe multilayer films were prepared by magnetron sputtering, and subsequently crystallized by rapid thermal annealing. The resulting films had small grain size (down to 10 nm) so that they are appropriate materials for <b>magneto-optical</b> <b>storage</b> applications. Depending on the Bi composition, Faraday rotation of up to 15 degrees/Î¼m was observed. Domain wall expansion into maze-like domains dominated the reversal process.

40|$|<b>Magneto-optical</b> {{information}} <b>storage</b> {{has been}} a hot research subject for several years. FePt exhibits abundant physical properties and has received much attention as a candidate material. Its alloy film with perpendicular anisotropy and small grain size has important applications in magnetic recordings due to the large intrinsic magnetic anisotropy which ensures long-time thermal stability of nanometer sized bits. However, the large coercive field of FePt is a significant factor that hinders its application. As is well known, the magnetic anisotropy in FePt alloy can be precisely modulated by carbon-doping, and as a result, the coercive field of FePt film can be modified effectively with the carbon dopant. On the other hand, the microscopic mechanism of magnetic storage relies on the motion of spin system. Ultrashort femtosecond laser has been demonstrated {{to be a very}} effective tool to investigate the dynamical coupling among different degrees of freedom, such as electron, spin and lattice in a ferromagnetic film. The research on spin dynamics has become a new frontier of condensed matter physics, which is crucial for ultrafast magnetic recording materials. In this work, by using the time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect spectroscopy, we study the ultrafast spin dynamics of two FePt alloy films with different carbon dopants under the applied magnetic field along the film surface. The FePt alloy films with different carbon dopants are fabricated on silicon substrates by the sputtering method. The main experimental findings in this work are as follows. (i) The transient Kerr signal is linearly proportional to the magnetization with the magnetic field up to 0. 8 T, while the transient reflectivity of the film is independent of the applied magnetic field. (ii) For FePt alloy films with different coercive fields, it is found that the demagnetization time of the film with smaller coercive field is significantly faster than that of the larger counterpart: the former shows 0. 8 ps demagnetization time, and the latter has a magnitude of 1. 2 ps. The demagnetization times for both soft and hard magnetic films are independent of the applied magnetic field. (iii) With ultrafast laser pulse radiation, we observe the propagation of acoustic phonon with a resonance frequency of ï½ 49 GHz, and the frequency of the acoustic phonon is independent of the applied magnetic field. From the above, the spin dynamics of the samples shows strong correlation with carbon-doping. Our experimental findings are desired for basic research {{as well as for the}} design and development of novel magneto-optical devices...|$|R
