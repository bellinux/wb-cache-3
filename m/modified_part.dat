'Memoire sur les Cucurbitacees' 1826 pages 6, 24.) and Naudin {{found that}} the {{cucumber}} (C. sativus) could not be crossed with any other species of the genus; therefore no doubt it is specifically distinct from the melon. This will appear to most persons a superfluous statement; yet we hear from Naudin (10/142. 'Flore des Serres' October 1861 quoted in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1861 page 1135. I have often consulted and taken some facts from M. Naudin's Memoir on Cucumis in 'Annal. des Sc. Nat.' 4th series Bot. tome 11 1859 page 5.) {{that there is a}} race of melons, in which the fruit is so like that of the cucumber, [...] "both externally and internally, that it is hardly possible to distinguish the one from the other except by the leaves." [...] The varieties of the melon seem to be endless, for Naudin after six years' study had not {{come to the end of}} them: he divides them into ten sections, including numerous sub-varieties which all intercross with perfect ease. (10/143. See also Sageret 'Memoire' page 7.) Of the forms considered by Naudin to be varieties, botanists have made thirty distinct species! [...] "and they had not the slightest acquaintance with the multitude of new forms which have appeared since their time." [...] Nor is the creation of so many species at all surprising when we consider how strictly their characters are transmitted by seed, and how wonderfully they differ in appearance: [...] "Mira est quidem foliorum et habitus diversitas, sed multo magis fructuum," [...] says Naudin. The fruit is the valuable part, and this, in accordance with the common rule, is the most <b>modified</b> <b>part.</b> Some melons are only as large as small plums, others weigh as much as sixty-six pounds. One variety has a scarlet fruit! Another is not more than an inch in diameter, but sometimes more than a yard in length, [...] "twisting about in all directions like a serpent." [...] It is a singular fact that in this latter variety many parts of the plant, namely, the stems, the footstalks of the female flowers, the middle lobe of the leaves, and especially the ovarium, as well as the mature fruit, all show a strong tendency to become elongated. Several varieties of the melon are interesting from assuming the characteristic features of distinct species and even of distinct though allied genera: thus the serpent-melon has some resemblance to the fruit of Trichosanthes anguina; we have seen that other varieties closely resemble cucumbers; some Egyptian varieties have their seeds attached to a portion of the pulp, and this is characteristic of certain wild forms. Lastly, a variety of melon from Algiers is remarkable from announcing its maturity by [...] "a spontaneous and almost sudden dislocation," [...] when deep cracks suddenly appear, and the fruit falls to pieces; and this occurs with the wild C. momordica. Finally, M. Naudin well remarks that this [...] "extraordinary production of races and varieties by a single species and their permanence when not interfered with by crossing, are phenomena well calculated to cause reflection." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1971, Dennis {{injured his}} hand badly {{enough to prevent}} him from playing drums for some time. Ricky Fataar took over as the group's drummer between 1972 and 1974. During this period Dennis acted as a co-frontman {{alongside}} Mike Love, as well as playing keyboards and singing. The 1973 live album The Beach Boys in Concert features only Dennis onstage among thousands of fans on the album cover; however, none of his songs were included in the lineup. During the three-year recording hiatus following Holland, Dennis's voice deteriorated markedly. By then his onstage antics (including streaking) occasionally disrupted the Beach Boys' live shows. In 1974, concurrent with the success of the '60s hits compilation Endless Summer, Dennis returned to his role behind the drums.

5000|$|The Kiga people, or Abakiga ("people of the mountains"), are {{an ethnic}} group located in {{northern}} Rwanda and southern Uganda. The Kiga speak a Bantu language called Rukiga. [...] They are {{sometimes referred to as}} the Chiga or Kiga, while the singular form is Omukiga. Additionally, a large number of Bakiga were still living in Rwanda at the time of European colonization. An Anglo-German Agreement signed in Brussels on 14 May 1910, <b>modified</b> <b>part</b> of the boundary between British and German territories initially established as the parallel of one degree south latitude by the treaty of 1890. Modified were the sectors between the Congo tripoint and the junction of the Kakitumba and Kagera, comprising the present Rwanda-Uganda boundary, and between the junction and the second crossing of the parallel of one degree south latitude by the Kagera, comprising the western segment of the present Tanzania-Uganda boundary. Details of the final delimitation and demarcation of the Rwanda-Uganda boundary between the Congo tripoint of Sabinio and the southwestern branch (Lubirizi) of the Tshinzinga (Muvogero) are given in an Anglo-German Protocol signed at Kamwezi on 30 October 1911. Therefore, many Bakiga became Ugandans by defacto in 1911 when the current international boundaries of Uganda were formally finalized.|$|E

40|$|A {{modified}} version of the Lee-Colley Environmental Statement Review Package is used to evaluate the environmental part of the GIWA scaling and scoping methodology.

The <b>modified</b> method contains <b>parts</b> of the review package that are intact, as well as exchanged or <b>modified</b> <b>parts.</b> These exchanged or <b>modified</b> <b>parts</b> meet the relevant requirements from the Esbo Convention, the EC Directives on SEA and EIA, and the Convention on Biological Diversity.

Examples like providing the possibility to amend features (e. g. water circulation) to the protocol and stressing the need for transparency in presented data, suggests that the GIWA scaling and scoping methodology still could be strengthened.
