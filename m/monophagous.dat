25|$|Many {{species are}} {{polyphagous}} in larva stage. <b>Monophagous</b> species, like the Cinnabar moth (Tyria jacobaeae) are scarce.|$|E
25|$|Many aphid {{species are}} <b>monophagous</b> (that is, they feed {{on only one}} plant species). Others, like the green peach aphid feed on {{hundreds}} of plant species across many families.|$|E
25|$|The base or basal {{species in}} a food web are those species without prey and can include autotrophs or {{saprophytic}} detritivores (i.e., the community of decomposers in soil, biofilms, and periphyton). Feeding connections in the web are called trophic links. The number of trophic links per consumer {{is a measure of}} food web connectance. Food chains are nested within the trophic links of food webs. Food chains are linear (noncyclic) feeding pathways that trace <b>monophagous</b> consumers from a base species up to the top consumer, which is usually a larger predatory carnivore.|$|E
25|$|Eggs {{take about}} 14 days to hatch into larvae, which eat continuously. They have a {{preference}} for white mulberry, having an attraction to the mulberry odorant cis-jasmone. They are not <b>monophagous</b> since they can eat other species of Morus, {{as well as some}} other Moraceae, mostly Osage orange. They are covered with tiny black hairs. When the color of their heads turns darker, it indicates they are about to molt. After molting, the instar phase of the silkworms emerge white, naked, and with little horns on their backs.|$|E
2500|$|Plant defense may explain, in part, why herbivores employ {{different}} life history strategies. [...] <b>Monophagous</b> species (animals that eat plants {{from a single}} genus) must produce specialized enzymes to detoxify their food, or develop specialized structures to deal with sequestered chemicals. [...] Polyphagous species (animals that eat plants from many different families), on the other hand, produce more detoxyfying enzymes (specifically MFO) {{to deal with a}} range of plant chemical defenses. Polyphagy often develops when a herbivore's host plants are rare as a necessity to gain enough food. [...] Monophagy is favored when there is interspecific competition for food, where specialization often increases an animals' competitive ability to use a resource.|$|E
50|$|The larvae are {{probably}} <b>monophagous</b> on Populus species.|$|E
50|$|In the Netherlands {{populations of}} L. dispar {{appear to be}} more <b>monophagous</b> on R. hydrolapathum.|$|E
50|$|Many {{species are}} {{polyphagous}} in larva stage. <b>Monophagous</b> species, like the Cinnabar moth (Tyria jacobaeae) are scarce.|$|E
50|$|Timarcha lugens is {{strictly}} <b>monophagous</b> on Hormathophylla spinosa (Brassicaceae), a stunted shrub abundant in many West Mediterranean high mountains. This beetle feeds on leaves, flower buds, flowers and fruits.|$|E
50|$|Many aphid {{species are}} <b>monophagous</b> (that is, they feed {{on only one}} plant species). Others, like the green peach aphid Myzus persicae, feed on {{hundreds}} of plant species across many families.|$|E
5000|$|These plants provide {{nourishment}} for {{a number}} of insect species of which the rare Euchloe tagis butterfly is the most striking example as it is <b>monophagous</b> on species in this genus.|$|E
50|$|P. coridon is <b>monophagous,</b> {{which means}} that they only feeds on one {{specific}} species of plant. The larvae or caterpillars of this species feed on the leaves of horseshoe vetch (Hippocrepis comosa) upon which the larvae feed.|$|E
50|$|A. cognata is a <b>monophagous</b> {{leaf miner}} {{of a variety}} of plants in the family Asteraceae, mainly feeding from August until October on Arctium lappa, Petasites fragrans, Petasites albus and Tussilago farfara. Pupation occurs externally, in the soil.|$|E
50|$|Timarcha tenebricosa is <b>monophagous,</b> the larva feed {{exclusively}} on bedstraws, especially species with tender leaves (Galium verum, Galium mollugo). Eggs are laid in spring on bedstraws. Larvae are quite large (up to 20 mm) blue-black in color. Pupa overwinter.|$|E
50|$|Larva reddish yellow; dorsal line fine, pale {{with dark}} edges; subdorsal lines blackish; spiracles black on a pale lateral stripe; head and {{thoracic}} plate yellowish.The larvae are <b>monophagous,</b> feeding exclusively on marram (Ammophila arenaria) leaves, {{a plant that}} grows on dunes along the shoreline.|$|E
50|$|M. ornata larvae have a brick-red {{head from}} the fourth larval instar and they are <b>monophagous</b> or oligophagous, feeding on {{different}} Asteraceae species, mainly on regionally different, sometime local endemic Centaurea species. M. phoebe {{on the other hand}} is oligophagous and its head capsule is always black.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Yucca brevifolia. Most Tegeticula species, {{including}} T. antithetica, are <b>monophagous,</b> and {{the adult}} moths only live {{for a few}} days, so they must access the plant during the short flowering period. This indicates that moth populations {{would have to be}} locally adapted for the flowering periods their specific hosts.|$|E
50|$|Larvae of the {{nominate}} subspecies {{have been}} recorded on Pongamia pinnata, Millettia atropurpurea and Pterocarpus marsupium in India. In southern China it has been recorded from Mucuna and Pueraria. Subspecies tsingtauica is <b>monophagous</b> on Fabaceae in China, including Acacia, Glycine, Mucuna, Pueraria and Robinia species. Other recorded food plants include Olea and Paulownia but these are almost certainly erroneous.|$|E
50|$|It {{seems that}} the moth had been {{translocated}} accidentally in horticultural stock and that the natural enemies had not been imported at the same time. Its very voracity combined with its <b>monophagous</b> feeding habits have however suggested that it might {{prove to be a}} valuable biological control of invasive Agapanthus in countries such as New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|Phylogenetic {{data have}} showed that this species of Eastern North American treehoppers (E. binotata) diverged from two {{closely related species}} of Enchenopa from Central and South America. These two Enchenopa species {{are known to be}} {{polyphagous}} (feeds on multiple species of plants) as opposed to E. binotata that are <b>monophagous</b> (only feeds on one species of plants).|$|E
50|$|Eriogonum {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). Several of these are <b>monophagous,</b> meaning their {{caterpillars}} only feed on this genus, sometimes just on a single taxon of Eriogonum. Wild buckwheat flowers are also {{an important source of}} food for these and other Lepidoptera. In some cases, the relationship is so close that Eriogonum and dependent Lepidoptera are in danger of coextinction.|$|E
50|$|Edith's checkerspot {{caterpillars}} {{will use}} various species of paintbrush (Castilleja), beardtongues (Penstemon), lousewort (Pedicularis), owl's clover (Orthocarpus), Chinese houses (Collinsia), and plantain (Plantago) as host plants. Many {{populations of the}} butterfly are <b>monophagous</b> and preference for the different plant types are based mainly on location. Many behaviors, such as egg laying habits and movements are locally adapted, so {{the survival of the}} butterflies relies heavily on the growing season of these host plants.|$|E
50|$|Its silk, {{one of the}} {{varieties}} of Tussar silk, has a glossy golden hue which improves with age and washing. It is never bleached or dyed and is stain resistant. It was reserved for the exclusive use of royal families in Assam for 600 years. Like other silkmoths, the female have a larger abdomen and slender antennae when compared to males. The larvae are vibrantly coloured and are <b>monophagous</b> as other silkmoths.|$|E
50|$|Bruchus are specialists, {{feeding and}} {{developing}} {{almost exclusively on}} plants of the legume tribe Fabeae (Vicieae), which includes peas, sweet peas, lentils, and vetches. Examples include cow vetch (Vicia cracca), which is attacked by at least nine Bruchus species, common vetch (Vicia sativa), which is host to five recorded species, and meadow vetchling (Lathyrus pratensis) and tuberous pea (Lathyrus tuberosus), which are each attacked by four species. Some Bruchus species are <b>monophagous,</b> living on just one host plant species.|$|E
50|$|Omnivores {{are usually}} generalists. Herbivores are often specialists, but those that eat {{a variety of}} plants may be {{considered}} generalists. A well-known example of a specialist animal is the koala, which subsists almost entirely on eucalyptus leaves. The raccoon is a generalist {{because it has a}} natural range that includes most of North and Central America, and it is omnivorous, eating berries, insects, eggs and small animals. <b>Monophagous</b> organisms feed exclusively, or nearly so, on a single other species.|$|E
50|$|The Epilachninae {{are most}} notorious as pests of crops in the {{families}} Solanaceae and Cucurbitaceae, {{but as a}} group they feed on a much wider range of plants. However, most species in the subfamily are <b>monophagous,</b> each feeding on just one species of plant, or at most a narrow range of closely related species. Among the crop plants they attack are grains such as maize, and legumes such as beans, including soya. Others attack spinach, and yet others feed on Brassicaceae and cotton.|$|E
50|$|N. annulata is a <b>monophagous</b> {{herbivore}} insect {{meaning that}} their diet {{is limited to}} a species of plant. A study found that N. annulata did not restrict itself to the native Senecio although the insects were found more frequently in the native forested areas than in the urban/rural area These findings are based on research in the Auckland area, and the study found that the numbers of Nyctemera would be far fewer if there were not the naturalised exotic species available to them.|$|E
50|$|In the larval stage, bagworms {{extend their}} head and thorax from their mobile case to devour {{the leaves of}} host plants, often leading {{to the death of}} their hosts. Trees infested with bagworms exhibit {{increasingly}} damaged foliage as the infestation increases until the leaves are stripped bare. Some bagworms are specialized in their host plants (<b>monophagous),</b> while others can feed on a variety of plant species (polyphagous). A few species also consume small arthropods (such as the camphor scale Pseudaonidia duplex, a scale insect).|$|E
50|$|Various populations {{live more}} or less <b>monophagous</b> on various host plants. In Spain, larvae have been {{recorded}} on Carduncellus monospeliensium, while they have been recorded on Cirsium eriophorum in France, Italy, Switzerland and southern Austria. In Germany, larvae feed on Carlina vulgaris and in eastern Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary the food plant is Echinops spaherocephalus. Young larvae mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine has {{the form of a}} fleck mine. The opening is a slit {{at the side of the}} mine.|$|E

50|$|Parallocorynus has to date {{only been}} {{collected}} from the cycad genus Dioon. Similarly Rhopalotria is associated with various species of Zamia cycads, though one of the as yet undescribed species was collected from Dioon spinulosum. It seems that the species of Rhopalotria are <b>monophagous</b> - like R. slossoni on Coontie (Z. pumila) or R. mollis on Cardboard Cycad (Z. furfuracea) - but more research in Zamia species in necessary to verify this. These two belid genera are very important pollinators of their host cycads; the larvae feed primarily on the sporophylls.|$|E
50|$|The plant-insect {{interactions}} of Pararistolochia enricoi are still unknown. In western and southern Madagascar the monospecific butterfly genus Pharmacophagus antenor (Drury, 1773) (the only {{representative of the}} tribe Troidini in Madagascar) {{is known to be}} <b>monophagous</b> on Aristolochia albida. As documented by Parsons (1996b), the larvae of the troidine papilionid butterflies of the Australasian genus Ornithoptera feed primarily on Pararistolochia in the Australasian region. Considering the overlapping distributions of P. enricoi and Pharmacophagus antenor together with the known feeding habits of the latter,one could hypothesize that P.antenor larvae also feed on Pararistolochia enricoi (Parsons, 1996b).|$|E
5000|$|This {{butterfly}} lays its eggs on {{the stalks}} of Texas sacahuista (Nolina texana). [...] Its caterpillars are naturally <b>monophagous</b> (feeding only) on this plant and eat both its flowers and its fruit. An entomologist at the University of California, Riverside, discovered {{they could be}} raised in the laboratory on Lotus scoparius {{with little or no}} retardation in development (whereas a few other picky lycaenids did not fare as well) suggesting that its ancestral range was once much larger. [...] Adults feed on the nectar of the same host plants used by their larvae.|$|E
50|$|G. lygdamus palosverdesensis {{persists}} {{particularly on}} the Palos Verdes Peninsula, 15 miles south of Los Angeles, in a coastal sage scrub habitat. This species is locally <b>monophagous,</b> or particular to one species of food plant. The entire species was originally thought to be particular only to the locoweed or rattlepod (Astragalus trichopodus lonchus), but the population rediscovered in 1994 used common deerweed (Lotus scoparius) as its larval food plant. These two types of plants are fast becoming scarce on the Palos Verdes Peninsula because of housing development. Retention of these larval food plants is essential for conservation of the Palos Verdes blue.|$|E
50|$|First, T. lugens is <b>monophagous</b> on the shrub H. spinosa. Unfortunately, {{the broad}} {{use of the}} high {{mountains}} to develop ski facilities leads to the removal of almost every plant taller than 15 cm. This results in the total elimination of the H. spinosa shrubs in those places where the ski runs are arranged. Furthermore, T. lugens is distributed only above 2500 m altitude, {{the part of the}} Sierra Nevada where ski is most intensely practiced. An aggressive development of ski will surely provoke a strong decrease in the abundance of H. spinosa and, therefore, in the abundance of T. lugens.|$|E
