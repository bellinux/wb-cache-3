5|$|Further {{dividing}} {{the varieties of}} fancy rats are the many different <b>markings.</b> Pet rats can appear in any combination of colors and <b>markings.</b> The <b>markings</b> are typically {{in reference to the}} patterns and ratios of colored hair versus white hair. Two extremes would be a self (completely solid, non-white color) and a Himalayan (completely white except blending into colored areas at the nose and feet, called points, as in a Himalayan cat's <b>markings).</b>|$|E

5|$|An {{inspection}} includes {{external and}} internal inspection for damage, corrosion, and correct colour and <b>markings.</b> The failure criteria {{vary according to the}} published standards of the relevant authority, but may include inspection for bulges, overheating, dents, gouges, electrical arc scars, pitting, line corrosion, general corrosion, cracks, thread damage, defacing of permanent <b>markings,</b> and colour coding.|$|E
5|$|Charles W. Holliday and Joseph R. Coelho {{devised a}} new key in 2004 to {{identify}} the Sphecius species, examining 4,451 wasps among the five New World species, and noting that 98% of the female S. convallis wasps examined had yellow <b>markings</b> on gastral tergites one to four (or fewer) and S.grandis had 98% yellow <b>markings</b> from tergites one to five (or more). The 2% percent of S.grandis that overlapped with S.convallis were determined by density of the punctation in colour of the first tergum against the second. The <b>markings</b> on S.grandis males {{were found to be}} the same as on females.|$|E
5|$|Early {{production}} Type 26s have no external <b>markings.</b> The revolvers have <b>markings</b> {{that indicate}} they were arsenal re-worked and {{believed to have}} been produced in late 1893 or early 1894 before official adoption. It is possible that around 300 revolvers with no external marking were produced. No known examples of Type 26 revolvers have duplicate serial numbers.|$|E
5|$|From 1 December 1924, until 1 September 1925, she was {{in reserve}} at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. On 25 November She went into reduced commission, {{returning}} to full commission 1 September 1926. In early 1927, Mercy was painted white with no hospital <b>markings,</b> {{but by the time}} of a 1931 visit to Vancouver, the <b>markings</b> had been restored.|$|E
5|$|Horses {{exhibit a}} {{diverse array of}} coat colors and {{distinctive}} <b>markings,</b> described by a specialized vocabulary. Often, a horse is classified first by its coat color, before breed or sex. Horses of the same color may be distinguished from one another by white <b>markings,</b> which, along with various spotting patterns, are inherited separately from coat color.|$|E
5|$|<b>Markings</b> have {{a strict}} standard, with {{detailed}} terminology, for showing in fancy rat pet shows. However, many domestic rats are not closely bred to any color standard; {{many of those}} found in pet shops will have mismarkings from a formal breeding perspective, which are defined as variations in <b>markings</b> that are not recognized as conforming to a breed standard published by a rat fancier organisation.|$|E

5|$|The female is plumaged {{like the}} male, but is duller {{and has a}} grey head with a {{different}} pattern from the male, though it bears {{a hint of the}} pale head <b>markings</b> of the male. The juvenile is like the female, but young males have black <b>markings</b> on the head from an early age.|$|E
5|$|The {{prominent}} <b>markings</b> that criss-cross {{the moon}} {{seem to be}} mainly albedo features, which emphasize low topography. There are few craters on Europa because its surface is tectonically active and young. Some theories suggest that Jupiter's gravity is causing these <b>markings,</b> as one side of Europa is constantly facing Jupiter. Also, volcanic water eruptions splitting the surface of Europa, and even geysers have been considered as a cause. The color of the <b>markings,</b> reddish-brown, is theorized {{to be caused by}} sulfur, but scientists cannot confirm that, because no data collection devices have been sent to Europa. Europa is primarily made of silicate rock and likely has an iron core. It has a tenuous atmosphere composed primarily of oxygen.|$|E
5|$|The {{shoulder}} of the cylinder carries stamp <b>markings</b> providing required information about the cylinder.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{variation}} in colour over its range, though occasional females are darker overall than average, with <b>markings</b> less prominent or absent. The double drummer is larger and darker overall than the northern double drummer (T.sessiliba); {{the latter has}} a white band on the abdomen, while the former has black <b>markings</b> {{on the leading edge}} (costa) of the forewing extending past the basal cell.|$|E
5|$|Through the 18thand19thcenturies, {{chestnut}} {{in various}} shades was the prevailing colour of Finnish horses, making up about 40-50percent of the breed, and bays, blacks and greys existed in much greater numbers than today: 34percent were bay, 16percent black, {{and the remaining}} 3percent were grey, palomino or spotted. Wide blazes and high leg <b>markings</b> were rare, unlike today; bold <b>markings</b> became common only in the 20thcentury.|$|E

5|$|A normal dog has {{a muscular}} {{appearance}} {{with a deep}} chest and strong legs. The French Spaniel has eyes of a dark amber colour, and a thick tail that tapers towards the tip. The hair is medium, dense, with long feathers on the ears, backs of the legs and tail. It has some waviness on the chest and otherwise lies flat on the body. The normal colour of a French Spaniel's coat is white with brown <b>markings</b> rather in shade from a light cinnamon to dark liver. Historically, the coat was only white with black <b>markings,</b> but the breed was mixed with other colours of Spaniels during the 19th century.|$|E

5|$|By {{examining}} unique striations, or <b>markings,</b> {{left behind}} on the bullet as it passes through the barrel and on the cartridge as it is hit by the firing pin, individual spent rounds can be linked back to a specific weapon. Known exemplars taken from a seized weapon can be directly compared to samples recovered from the scene using a comparison microscope. Striation images can also be uploaded to any existing national databases. Furthermore, these <b>markings</b> {{can be compared to}} other images in an attempt to link one weapon to multiple crime scenes. Like all forensic specialties, forensic firearm examiners are subject to being called to testify in court as expert witnesses.|$|E
5|$|Colors {{accepted}} by the breed registry include chestnut, bay and seal brown (the latter called black pangaré by the breed registry, although these horses are genetically brown, not black with pangaré <b>markings).</b> Bays with white <b>markings</b> are the most popular. Norman Cobs are known as calm, willing horses with strong personalities. The breed's Thoroughbred ancestry gives them energy and athleticism, and makes them mature faster than other draft breeds. They show great endurance when ridden, and are relatively hardy, accepting outdoor living and changes in climate. Traditionally the Norman Cob had its tail docked, a practice that continued until January 1996, when the practice became illegal in France.|$|E
5|$|Differences in <b>markings</b> and {{appearance}} across surviving Type 26 revolvers, {{has led to}} the categorization of production runs into five categories.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} history of the breed, certain white <b>markings</b> and whorls were {{considered}} to be indicators of character and good or bad luck. Horses with white socks on their feet were considered to have good or bad luck, depending on the leg or legs marked. A horse with no white <b>markings</b> at all was considered to be ill-tempered and vice-ridden, while certain facial <b>markings</b> were considered representative of honesty, loyalty and endurance. Similarly, hair whorls in various places were considered to show good or bad luck, with the most unlucky being in places where the horse could not see them – for example the temples, cheek, shoulder or heart. Two whorls near the root of the tail were considered a sign of courage and good luck.|$|E
5|$|Lambs {{are usually}} marked at {{three to six}} weeks of age, but a {{protracted}} lambing season may necessitate two <b>markings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Laridae is {{a family}} of medium to large seabirds and {{includes}} gulls, kittiwakes, terns and skimmers. They are typically gray or white, often with black <b>markings</b> on the head or wings. They have longish bills and webbed feet. Terns are a group of generally medium to large seabirds typically with gray or white plumage, often with black <b>markings</b> on the head. Most terns hunt fish by diving but some pick insects off the surface of fresh water. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with several species known to live in excess of 25–30 years.|$|E
5|$|Red fox body {{language}} consists of {{movements of the}} ears, tail and postures, with their body <b>markings</b> emphasising certain gestures. Postures {{can be divided into}} aggressive/dominant and fearful/submissive categories. Some postures may blend the two together.|$|E
5|$|Some species, {{such as the}} gemsbok, sable antelope, and Grant's gazelle, are camouflaged with {{strongly}} disruptive facial <b>markings</b> that {{conceal the}} highly recognisable eye. Many species, such as gazelles, may be made to look flat, and hence to blend into the background, by countershading. The outlines of many bovids are broken up with bold disruptive colouration, the strongly contrasting patterns helping to delay recognition by predators. However, all the Hippotraginae (including the gemsbok) have pale bodies and faces with conspicuous <b>markings.</b> The zoologist Tim Caro describes this as difficult to explain, but given that the species are diurnal, he suggests that the <b>markings</b> may function in communication. Strongly contrasting leg colouration is common only in the Bovidae, where for example Bos, Ovis, bontebok and gemsbok have white stockings. Again, communication is the likely function.|$|E

5|$|T.chatareus can be {{distinguished}} by their sooty colour, {{as opposed to the}} typical silver of most other archerfish. They have five dorsal spines, whereas T.jaculatrix have four. The <b>markings</b> on their flanks are also alternating long and short spots rather than bands. T.chatareus also have six or seven <b>markings</b> on its sides, whilst banded archerfish have four to five. T.chatareus has 29–30 lateral line scales, compared to 33–35 in T. jaculatrix. T.chatareus are also less common upstream than T.microlepis.|$|E
5|$|The {{colour pattern}} varies, ranging from very light-coloured {{specimens}} with small, incomplete, dark dorsal crossbars to entirely brown ones with faint or clear, darker brown <b>markings,</b> {{and on to}} melanistic individuals that are entirely dark and lack any apparent dorsal pattern. However, most {{have some kind of}} zigzag dorsal pattern down the entire length of their bodies and tails. The head usually has a distinctive dark V or X on the back. A dark streak runs from the eye to the neck and continues as a longitudinal series of spots along the flanks. Unusual for snakes, the sexes are possible to tell apart by the colour. Females are usually brownish in hue with dark-brown <b>markings,</b> the males are pure grey with black <b>markings.</b> The basal colour of males will often be slightly lighter than that of the females, making the black zigzag pattern stand out. The melanistic individuals are often females.|$|E
5|$|The {{island is}} also home to slowworms (Anguis fragilis). Flat Holm's slow-worm {{population}} has unusually large blue <b>markings.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{timing of}} this {{migration}} is critical; all white <b>markings,</b> from a small star to a pure white coat, are caused by the failed migration of melanocytes.|$|E
5|$|Their coat differs geographically, with elands {{in north}} Africa having {{distinctive}} <b>markings</b> (torso stripes, <b>markings</b> on legs, dark garters and a spinal crest) that are absent in the south. Apart from a rough mane, the coat is smooth. Females have a tan coat, while the coats of males are darker, with a bluish-grey tinge. Bulls {{may also have}} a series of vertical white stripes on their sides (mainly in parts of the Karoo in South Africa). As males age, their coat becomes more grey. Males also have dense fur on their foreheads and a large dewlap on their throats.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a greater}} number of colours of coat present in the Cardigan breed than the Pembroke, with the breed {{standard}} allowing for a variety of shades of red, sable and brindle. White <b>markings</b> are expected on this breed of Corgi, and one with a black coat is allowed to have tan or brindle points under conformation show rules. Merle <b>markings</b> are present in the breed, although this is normally restricted to blue merle. There are several disqualification criteria in the breed standard for the purpose of conformation showing. This would include drop ears, a white coat, blue eyes or non-solid black noses in dogs without merle colouration.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{accepted}} coat colours, red and blue, though {{chocolate and}} cream do occur. Blue dogs can be blue, blue mottled, or blue speckled {{with or without}} black, tan, or white <b>markings.</b> Red dogs are evenly speckled with solid red <b>markings.</b> Both red dogs and blue dogs are born white (except for any solid-coloured body or face <b>markings)</b> and the red or black hairs grow in as they mature. The distinctive adult colouration {{is the result of}} black or red hairs closely interspersed through a predominantly white coat. This is not merle colouration (a speckled effect that has associated health issues), but rather the result of the ticking gene. A number of breeds show ticking, which is the presence of colour through white areas, though the overall effect depends on other genes that will modify the size, shape and density of the ticking.|$|E
