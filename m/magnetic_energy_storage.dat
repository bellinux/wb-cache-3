2500|$|Superconducting <b>{{magnetic}}</b> <b>energy</b> <b>storage</b> (SMES) systems store {{energy in}} the magnetic field created by the flow of direct current in a [...] superconducting coil which has been cryogenically cooled to a temperature below its superconducting critical temperature. A typical SMES system includes three parts: superconducting coil, power conditioning system and cryogenically cooled refrigerator. Once the superconducting coil is charged, the current will not decay and the magnetic energy can be stored indefinitely. The stored energy can be released back to the network by discharging the coil. The power conditioning system uses an inverter/rectifier to transform alternating current (AC) power to direct current or convert DC back to AC power. The inverter/rectifier accounts for about 2–3% energy loss in each direction. SMES loses {{the least amount of}} electricity in the energy storage process compared to other methods of storing energy. SMES systems are highly efficient; the round-trip efficiency is greater than 95%. The high cost of superconductors is the primary limitation for commercial use of this energy storage method.|$|E

30|$|Magnetic {{nanoparticle}} superstructures with controlled magnetic alignment {{and desired}} structural anisotropy hold promise for applications in data <b>storage</b> and <b>energy</b> <b>storage.</b> Assembly of monodisperse magnetic nanoparticles under {{a magnetic field}} could lead to highly ordered superstructures, providing distinctive magnetic properties. In this work, a low-cost fabrication technique was demonstrated to assemble sub- 20 -nm iron oxide nanoparticles into crystalline superstructures under an in-plane magnetic field. The gradient of the applied magnetic field contributes to the anisotropic formation of micron-sized superstructures. The magnitude of the applied magnetic field promotes the alignment of magnetic moments of the nanoparticles. The strong dipole-dipole interactions between the neighboring nanoparticles lead to a close-packed pattern as an energetically favorable configuration. Rod-shaped and spindle-shaped superstructures with uniform size and controlled spacing were obtained using spherical and polyhedral nanoparticles, respectively. The arrangement and alignment of the superstructures can be tuned by changing the experimental conditions. The two types of superstructures both show enhancement of coercivity and saturation magnetization along the applied field direction, which is presumably associated with the magnetic anisotropy and magnetic dipole interactions of the constituent nanoparticles and the increased shape anisotropy of the superstructures.

50|$|There {{are several}} reasons for using superconducting <b>magnetic</b> <b>energy</b> <b>storage</b> instead of other energy storage methods. The most {{important}} advantage of SMES is that the time delay during charge and discharge is quite short. Power is available almost instantaneously and very high power output can be provided {{for a brief period}} of time. Other energy storage methods, such as pumped hydro or compressed air, have a substantial time delay associated with the energy conversion of stored mechanical energy back into electricity. Thus if demand is immediate, SMES is a viable option. Another advantage is that the loss of power is less than other storage methods because electric currents encounter almost no resistance. Additionally the main parts in a SMES are motionless, which results in high reliability.|$|E

The two types of superstructures both show magnetic easy axes along the applied field direction, and they also show enhancement of coercivity and saturation magnetization along their easy axes. The enhanced magnetism in the superstructures is associated with magnetic anisotropy and dipole interactions of the nanoparticles and shape anisotropy of the superstructures.

5000|$|According to Woodward, a {{transient}} mass fluctuation arises in an object when it absorbs [...] "internal" [...] energy {{as it is}} accelerated. Several devices could be built to store internal energy during accelerations.

40|$|In {{the solar}} corona, {{magnetic}} flux rope {{is believed to}} be a fundamental structure accounts for <b>magnetic</b> free <b>energy</b> <b>storage</b> and solar eruptions. Up to the present, the extrapolation of magnetic field from boundary data is the primary way to obtain fully three-dimensional magnetic information of the corona. As a result, the ability of reliable recovering coronal magnetic flux rope is important for coronal field extrapolation. In this paper, our coronal field extrapolation code (CESE-MHD-NLFFF, Jiang & Feng 2012) is examined with an analytical magnetic flux rope model proposed by Titov & Demoulin (1999), which consists of a bipolar magnetic configuration holding an semi-circular line-tied flux rope in force-free equilibrium. By using only the vector field in the bottom boundary as input, we test our code with the model in a representative range of parameter space and find that the model field is reconstructed with high accuracy. Especially, the magnetic topological interfaces formed between the flux rope and the surrounding arcade, i. e., the "hyperbolic flux tube" and "bald patch separatrix surface", are also reliably reproduced. By this test, we demonstrate that our CESE-MHD-NLFFF code can be applied to recovering magnetic flux rope in the solar corona as long as the vector magnetogram satisfies the force-free constraints.

In the future these interactions will be the basic building blocks of more complicated simulations involving hundreds of elements.

The extrapolations assume that the ratio of internal energy of the plasma to <b>magnetic</b> <b>energy,</b> the plasma-beta is negligible. Despite {{the widespread use of}} this assumption observations, models, and theoretical considerations show that beta is of the order of a few percent to more than 10 %, and thus not small. We investigate what consequences this has for the reliability of extrapolation results. We use basic concepts starting with the force and the energy balance to infer relations between plasma-beta and free <b>magnetic</b> <b>energy,</b> to study the direction of currents in the corona with respect to the magnetic field, and to estimate the errors in the free <b>magnetic</b> <b>energy</b> by neglecting effects of the plasma (beta<< 1). A comparison with a 3 D MHD model supports our basic considerations. If plasma-beta is of the order of the relative free energy (the ratio of the free <b>magnetic</b> <b>energy</b> to the total <b>magnetic</b> <b>energy)</b> then the pressure gradient can balance the Lorentz force. This is the case in the solar corona, and therefore the currents are not properly described. In particular the error in terms of <b>magnetic</b> <b>energy</b> by neglecting the plasma is of the order of the free <b>magnetic</b> <b>energy,</b> so that the latter can not be reliably determined by an extrapolation. While a force-free extrapolation might capture the magnetic structure and connectivity of the coronal magnetic field, the derived currents and free <b>magnetic</b> <b>energy</b> are not reliable.
