40|$|OBJECTIVE : This study {{examined}} the statistical properties of normal air-conduction thresholds obtained with automated and <b>manual</b> <b>audiometry</b> {{to test the hypothesis}} that thresholds are normally distributed and to examine the distributions for evidence of bias in manual testing. DESIGN : Four databases were mined for normal thresholds. One contained audiograms obtained with an automated method. The other three were obtained with <b>manual</b> <b>audiometry.</b> Frequency distributions were examined for four test frequencies (250, 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz). STUDY SAMPLE : The analysis is based on 317 569 threshold determinations of 80 547 subjects from four clinical databases. RESULTS : Frequency distributions of thresholds obtained with automated audiometry are normal in form. Corrected for age, the mean thresholds are within 1. 5 dB of reference equivalent threshold sound pressure levels. Frequency distributions of thresholds obtained by <b>manual</b> <b>audiometry</b> are shifted toward higher thresholds. Two of the three datasets obtained by <b>manual</b> <b>audiometry</b> are positively skewed. CONCLUSIONS : The positive shift and skew of the <b>manual</b> <b>audiometry</b> data may result from tester bias. The striking scarcity of thresholds below 0 dB HL suggests that audiologists place less importance on identifying low thresholds than they do for higher-level thresholds. We refer to this as the Good enough bias and suggest that it may be responsible for differences in distributions of thresholds obtained by automated and <b>manual</b> <b>audiometry.</b> By grant RC 3 DC 010986 from the National Institutes of Deafness and Other Communication Disorders.

40|$|To {{validate}} the air- and bone-conduction AMTAS automated audiometry system. Design: Prospective study. Test-retest reliability {{was determined by}} assessing adults with AMTAS air- and bone-conduction audiometry. Accuracy was determined by comparing AMTAS and <b>manual</b> <b>audiometry</b> conducted on adults. AMTAS testing was conducted in a quiet room and <b>manual</b> <b>audiometry</b> in a sound booth. Study sample: Ten participants for test-retest reliability tests and 44 participants to determine accuracy were included. Participants had varying degrees of hearing loss. Results: For test-retest reliability the overall difference in air-conduction hearing thresholds (n 119) was 0. 5 dB. The spread of differences (standard deviation of absolute differences) was 4. 9 dB. For bone-conduction thresholds (n 99) the overall difference was 0. 2 dB, {{and the spread of}} differences 4. 5 dB. For accuracy the overall difference in air-conduction hearing thresholds (n 509) between the two techniques was 0. 1 dB. The spread of differences was 6. 4 dB. For bone-conduction thresholds (n 295) the overall difference was 0 dB, and the spread of differences 7. 7 dB. Conclusions: Variations between air- and bone-conduction audiometry for automated and <b>manual</b> <b>audiometry</b> were within normally accepted limits for audiometry. However, AMTAS thresholds were elevated but not signifi cantly different compared to other contemporary studies that included an automated audiometer. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES : Five {{databases}} were mined {{to examine}} distributions of airbone gaps obtained by automated and <b>manual</b> <b>audiometry.</b> Differences in distribution characteristics were examined {{for evidence of}} influences unrelated to the audibility of test signals. DESIGN : The databases provided air- and bone-conduction thresholds that permitted examination of air-bone gap distributions that were free of ceiling and floor effects. Cases with conductive hearing loss were eliminated based on air-bone gaps, tympanometry, and otoscopy, when available. The analysis is based on 2, 378, 921 threshold determinations from 721, 831 subjects from five databases. RESULTS : Automated audiometry produced air-bone gaps that were normally distributed suggesting that air- and bone-conduction thresholds are normally distributed. <b>Manual</b> <b>audiometry</b> produced air-bone gaps that were not normally distributed and show evidence of biasing effects of assumptions of expected results. In one database, {{the form of the}} distributions showed evidence of inclusion of conductive hearing losses. CONCLUSIONS : Thresholds obtained by <b>manual</b> <b>audiometry</b> show tester bias effects from assumptions of the patient’s hearing loss characteristics. Tester bias artificially reduces the variance of bone-conduction thresholds and the resulting air-bone gaps. Because the automated method is free of bias from assumptions of expected results, these distributions are hypothesized to reflect the true variability of air- and boneconduction thresholds and the resulting air-bone gaps.

40|$|<b>Manual</b> {{pure tone}} <b>audiometry</b> is {{considered}} to be the gold standard for the assessment of hearing thresholds and has been in consistent use {{for a long period of}} time. An increased legislative requirement to monitor and screen workers, and an increasing amount of legislation relating to hearing loss is putting greater reliance on this as a tool. There are a number of questions regarding the degree of accuracy of pure tone audiometry when undertaken in field conditions, particularly relating to the difference in conditions between laboratory calibration and clinical or industrial screening use. This study analyzed the output sound pressure level of four different commercial audiometers, all using TDH 39 headphones and each of which had recently undergone calibration at an appropriate laboratory. Levels were measured using a Bruël and Kjaer Head and Torso simulator, which accurately replicates the size and shape of a human head, including the ears. A clinical environment was simulated by a trained audiometrist replacing the headphones for each test. Tests were undertaken at three presentation levels, and at the frequencies of 250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, 4 kHz and 6 kHz. The results showed a high level of test-retest variability, both between different audiometers and within the same audiometer. Maximum variation of sound pressure level at the ear for the same tone presentation was 21 decibels, with a particularly high level of variation at 6 kHz for all meters. An audiometer with attenuating cups exhibited significantly higher variation than ones using supral-aural headphones. Overall the variation exhibited suggests that there is a higher degree of potential error with screening pure tone audiometry than is commonly assumed and that results particularly at the 6 kHz frequency need to be assessed carefully alongside other methods such as speech audiometry...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE : This study {{investigated}} the reliability, accuracy, and time efficiency of automated hearing assessment using a computer-based telemedicine-compliant audiometer. MATERIALS AND METHODS : Thirty normal-hearing subjects and eight hearing-impaired subjects were tested with pure-tone air conduction audiometry (125 – 8, 000 Hz) in a manual and automated configuration in a counterbalanced manner. For the normal-hearing group each test was repeated to determine test-retest reliability and recording time, and preference for threshold-seeking method (manual vs. automated) was documented. RESULTS : Test-retest thresholds {{were not significantly different}} for manual and automated testing. <b>Manual</b> <b>audiometry</b> test-retest correspondence was 5 dB or less in 88 % of thresholds compared to 91 % for automated audiometry. Thresholds for automated audiometry did not differ significantly from <b>manual</b> <b>audiometry</b> with 87 % of thresholds in the normal-hearing group and 97 % in the hearingimpaired group, corresponding within 5 dB or less of each other. The largest overall average absolute difference across frequencies was 3. 6 – 3. 9 dB for the normal-hearing group and 3. 3 – 2. 4 for the hearing-impaired group. Both techniques were equally time efficient in the normal-hearing population, and 63 % of subjects preferred the automated threshold-seeking method. CONCLUSIONS : Automated audiometry provides reliable, accurate, and time-efficient hearing assessments for normal-hearing and hearing-impaired adults. Combined with an asynchronous telehealth model it holds significant potential for reaching underserved areas where hearing health professionals are unavailable...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES : A {{systematic}} {{literature review}} and meta-analysis on the validity (test–retest reliability and accuracy) of automated threshold audiometry {{compared with the}} gold standard of manual threshold audiometry was conducted. DESIGN : A systematic literature review was completed in peer-reviewed databases on automated compared with manual threshold audiometry. Subsequently a meta-analysis {{was conducted on the}} validity of automated audiometry. METHODS : A multifaceted approach, covering several databases and using different search strategies was used to ensure comprehensive coverage and to cross-check search findings. Databases included: MEDLINE, Scopus, and PubMed; a secondary search strategy was the review of references from identified reports. Reports including within-subject comparisons of manual and automated threshold audiometry were selected according to inclusion/exclusion criteria before data were extracted. For the meta-analysis weighted mean differences (and standard deviations) on test–retest reliability for automated compared with <b>manual</b> <b>audiometry</b> were determined to assess the validity of automated threshold audiometry. RESULTS : In total, 29 reports on automated audiometry (method of limits and the method of adjustment techniques) met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Most reports included data on adult populations using air conduction testing with limited data on children, bone conduction testing and the effects of hearing status on automated audiometry. Metaanalysis test–retest reliability for automated audiometry was within typical test–retest variability for <b>manual</b> <b>audiometry.</b> Accuracy results on the meta-analysis indicated overall average differences between manual and automated air conduction audiometry (0. 4 dB, 6. 1 SD) to be comparable with test–retest differences for manual (1. 3 dB, 6. 1 SD) and automated (0. 3 dB, 6. 9 SD) audiometry. No significant differences (p > 0. 01; summarized data analysis of variance) were seen in any of the comparisons between test–retest reliability of manual and automated audiometry compared with differences between manual and automated audiometry. CONCLUSION : Automated audiometry provides an accurate measure of hearing threshold, but validation data are still limited for (1) automated bone conduction audiometry; (2) automated audiometry in children and difficult-to-test populations and; (3) different types and degrees of hearing loss.

40|$|OBJECTIVE : Examine the {{accuracy}} of automated audiometry in a clinically heterogeneous population of adults using the KUDUwave automated audiometer. DESIGN : Prospective accuracy study. <b>Manual</b> <b>audiometry</b> was performed in a sound-treated room and automated audiometry was not conducted in a sound-treated environment. STUDY SAMPLE : 42 consecutively recruited participants from a tertiary otolaryngology department in Western Australia. RESULTS : Absolute mean differences ranged between 5. 12 – 9. 68 dB (air-conduction) and 8. 26 – 15. 00 dB (bone-conduction). 86. 5 % of manual and automated 4 FAs were within 10 dB (i. e. ± 5 dB); 94. 8 % were within 15 dB. However, there were significant (p 0. 05; R 2 = 0. 11). The presence of a hearing loss (better ear ≥ 26 dB) did not significantly affect accuracy (p = 0. 604; air-conduction), (p = 0. 218; boneconduction). CONCLUSIONS : This study provides clinical validation of automated audiometry using the KUDUwave in a clinically heterogeneous population, {{without the use of}} a sound-treated environment. Whilst threshold variations were statistically significant, future research is needed to ascertain the clinical significance of such variation. [URL] Pathology and Audiolog...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} hearing health care {{services}} across the world far outweighs the capacity to deliver these services with the present shortage of hearing health care personnel. Automated test procedures coupled with telemedicine may assist in extending services. Automated threshold audiometry has existed for many decades; however, {{there has been a}} lack of systematic evidence supporting its clinical use. The aim {{of this study was to}} systematically review the current body of peer-reviewed publications on the validity (test-retest reliability and accuracy) of automated threshold audiometry. A meta-analysis was thereafter conducted to combine and quantify the results of individual reports so that an overall assessment of validity based on existing evidence could be made for automated threshold audiometry. A systematic literature review and meta-analysis was conducted using peerreviewed publications. A multifaceted approach, covering several databases and employing different search strategies, was utilized to ensure comprehensive coverage and crosschecking of search findings. Publications were obtained using the following three databases: Medline, SCOPUS and PubMed, and by inspecting the reference list of relevant reports. Reports were selected based according to inclusion and an exclusion criterion, thereafter data extraction was conducted. Subsequently, the meta-analysis combined and quantified data to determine the validity of automated threshold audiometry. In total, 29 articles met the inclusion criteria. The outcomes from these studies indicated that two types of automated threshold testing procedures have been utilized, the ‘method of limits’ and ‘method of adjustments’. Reported findings suggest accurate and reliable thresholds when utilizing automated audiometry. Most of the reports included data on adult populations using air conduction testing, limited data on children, bone conduction testing and the effects of hearing status on automated threshold testing were however reported. The meta-analysis revealed that test-retest reliability for automated threshold audiometry was within typical testretest reliability for <b>manual</b> <b>audiometry.</b> Furthermore, the meta-analysis showed comparable overall average differences between manual and automated air conduction audiometry (0. 4 dB, 6. 1 SD) compared to test-retest differences for manual (1. 3 dB, 6. 1 SD) and automated (0. 3 dB, 6. 9 SD) air conduction audiometry. Overall, no significant differences (p> 0. 01; Summarized Data ANOVA) were obtained in any of the comparisons between test-retest reliability (manual and automated) and accuracy. Current evidence demonstrates that automated threshold audiometry can produce an accurate measure of hearing threshold. The differences between automated and <b>manual</b> <b>audiometry</b> fall within typical test-retest and inter-tester variability. Despite its long history however, validation is still limited for (i) automated bone conduction audiometry; (ii) automated audiometry in children and difficult-to-test populations and; (iii) automated audiometry with different types and degrees of hearing loss.

40|$|INTRODUCTION : Standard {{criteria}} {{exist for}} diagnosing {{different types of}} hearing loss, yet audiologists interpret audiograms manually. This pilot study examined the feasibility of standardised interpretations of audiometry in a telehealth model of care. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine diagnostic accuracy of automated audiometry in adults with hearing loss in an asynchronous telehealth model using pre-defined diagnostic protocols. MATERIALS AND METHODS : We recruited 42 study participants from a public audiology and otolaryngology clinic in Perth, Western Australia. <b>Manual</b> <b>audiometry</b> was performed by an audiologist either before or after automated audiometry. Diagnostic protocols were applied asynchronously for normal hearing, disabling hearing loss, conductive hearing loss and unilateral hearing loss. Sensitivity and specificity analyses were conducted using a two-by-two matrix and Cohen’s kappa was used to measure agreement. RESULTS : The overall sensitivity for the diagnostic criteria was 0. 88 (range: 0. 86 – 1) and overall specificity was 0. 93 (range: 0. 86 – 0. 97). Overall Kappa (k) agreement was “substantial” k = 0. 80 [95 %CI 0. 70, 0. 89] and significant at p< 0. 001. DISCUSSION : Pre-defined diagnostic protocols applied asynchronously to automated audiometry provide accurate identification of disabling, conductive and unilateral hearing loss. This method has the potential to improve synchronous and asynchronous tele-audiology service delivery. [URL] Pathology and Audiolog...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether a combination of automatically administered pure-tone audiometry and a tone-in-noise detection task, both delivered via an air conduction (AC) pathway, could reliably and validly predict the presence of a conductive component to the hearing loss. The authors hypothesized that performance on the battery of tests would vary according to hearing loss type. A secondary objective was to evaluate the reliability and validity of a novel automatic audiometry algorithm to assess its suitability for inclusion in the test battery. Design: Participants underwent a series of hearing assessments that were conducted in a randomized order: manual pure-tone air conduction audiometry and bone conduction audiometry; automatic pure-tone air conduction audiometry; and an automatic tone-in-noise detection task. The automatic tests were each administered twice. The ability of the automatic test battery to: (a) predict the presence of an air–bone gap (ABG); and (b) accurately measure AC hearing thresholds was assessed against the results of <b>manual</b> <b>audiometry.</b> Test–retest conditions were compared to determine the reliability of each component of the automatic test battery. Data were collected on 120 ears from normal-hearing and conductive, sensorineural, and mixed hearing-loss subgroups. Results: Performance differences between different types of hearing loss were observed. Ears with a conductive component (conductive and mixed ears) tended to have normal signal to noise ratios (SNR) despite impaired thresholds in quiet, while ears without a conductive component (normal and sensorineural ears) demonstrated, on average, an increasing relationship between their thresholds in quiet and their achieved SNR. Using the relationship between these two measures among ears with no conductive component as a benchmark, the likelihood that an ear has a conductive component can be estimated based on the deviation from this benchmark. The sensitivity and specificity of the test battery vary depending on the size of this deviation, but increase with increasing ABG size, with decreasing test frequency, and when results from multiple test frequencies are taken into account. The individual automatic tests comprising the battery were found to be reliable and valid, with strong, significant correlations between the test and retest results (r = 0. 81 to 0. 99; p < 0. 0001) and between automatic and <b>manual</b> <b>audiometry</b> procedures (r = 0. 98 to 0. 99; p < 0. 0001). Conclusions: The presence of an ABG can be predicted with a reasonably high degree of accuracy using AC tests alone. Applications of such a test battery include any clinical context in which bone conduction audiometry or specialized diagnostic equipment is unavailable or impractical. Examples of these include self-fitting hearing aids, whose efficacy relies on the ability of the device to automatically administer an in situ hearing test; self-administered adult hearing screenings in both clinical and home environments; large-scale industrial hearing conservation programs; and test environments in which ambient noise levels exceed the maximum permissible levels for unoccluded ears. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Objective. The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the feasibility of an Apple iOS-based automated hearing testing application and to compare its accuracy with conventional audiometry. Study Design. Prospective diagnostic study. Setting. Academic medical center. Subjects and Methods. An iOS-based software application was developed to perform automated pure-tone hearing testing on the iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad. To assess for device variations and compatibility, preliminary work was performed to compare the standardized sound output (dB) of various Apple device and headset combinations. Forty-two subjects underwent automated iOS-based hearing testing in a sound booth, automated iOS-based hearing testing in a quiet room, and conventional <b>manual</b> <b>audiometry.</b> Results. The maximum difference in sound intensity between various Apple device and headset combinations was 4 dB. On average, 96 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 91 %- 100 %) of the threshold values obtained using the automated test in a sound booth were within 10 dB of the corresponding threshold values obtained using conventional audiometry. When the automated test was performed in a quiet room, 94 % (95 % CI, 87 %- 100 %) of the threshold values were within 10 dB of the threshold values obtained using conventional audiometry. Under standardized testing conditions, 90 % of the subjects preferred iOS-based audiometry as opposed to conventional audiometry. Conclusion. Apple iOS-based devices provide a platform for automated air conduction audiometry without requiring extra equipment and yield hearing test results that approach those of conventional audiometry. © American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2013...|$|E
