Later that year New York art-house publication Visionaire released an audio media package called Visionaire 53 which brought together many disparate artists in the producing of one-minute-only pieces of music. <b>Magnétophone</b> contributed to this release along with other artists including Yoko Ono, U2, Michael Stipe, Pet Shop Boys, Cindy Sherman and it consisted of five records, 2 cds, a record player and dome container.|$|E
25|$|<b>Magnétophone</b> are an {{electronic}} / art rock band originating from Birmingham UK, composed of Matt Saunders (born 1972) and John Hanson (born 1973). Since their inception {{in the mid-1990s}} they have released two albums, I Guess Sometimes I Need to Be Reminded of How Much You Love Me and The Man Who Ate the Man, plus numerous singles and EPs and are currently signed to the revered art-house record label 4AD. <b>Magnétophone</b> rose to international recognition out of a period of vibrant musical activity in the second city, which also spawned contemporaries Broadcast.|$|E
25|$|Matt Saunders and John Hanson formed <b>Magnétophone</b> in 1995 {{after they}} met at an art school on the {{outskirts}} of Birmingham in 1992. Their musical backgrounds followed similar lines in that they both played in rock-influenced bands.|$|E
5000|$|She co-wrote {{and played}} guitar on <b>Magnetophones</b> [...] "Kels Vintage Thought". She has also {{performed}} duets with Kris Kristofferson and Supersuckers, and lately {{has been playing}} in the band R. Ring.|$|R
25|$|<b>Magnetophone's</b> {{music was}} {{at odds with}} the Brit Pop 'indie' guitar bands that predominated in the second city's venues; consequently, from 1998-1999 Saunders and Hanson {{organised}} and promoted their own night of 'alternative' music entitled 'We Brought Our Friends'.|$|R
50|$|Keen to {{make use}} of the new {{recorders}} as soon as possible, Crosby invested $50,000 of his own money into Ampex, and the tiny six-man concern soon became the world leader in the development of tape recording, revolutionizing radio and recording with its famous Ampex Model 200 tape deck, issued in 1948 and developed directly from Mullin's modified <b>Magnetophones.</b>|$|R
25|$|Murdo MacKenzie of Bing Crosby Enterprises {{had seen}} a {{demonstration}} of the German Magnetophon in June 1947—the same device that Jack Mullin had brought back from Radio Frankfurt, along with 50 reels of tape, {{at the end of the}} war. It was one of the magnetic tape recorders that BASF and AEG had built in Germany starting in 1935. The 6.5mm ferric-oxide-coated tape could record 20 minutes per reel of high-quality sound. Alexander M. Poniatoff ordered his Ampex company, which he'd founded in 1944, to manufacture an improved version of the <b>Magnetophone.</b>|$|E
25|$|The records between 1998 and 2000 {{showed the}} basis of the <b>Magnétophone</b> sound to be rooted in the {{electronic}} field, but it was also moving outside of it as its 'organic-ness' and obvious human intervention and performance appeared to be informed by guitar bands like My Bloody Valentine and MC5, and it is this that separates them from other electronica records of the same period and which caught the attention of 4AD's A department. These records were still instrumental and took in elements of drum'n'bass, IDM, ambient-techno and avant-garde sound sculpting, and were tied together by strong, though sometimes hidden or intermittent melodies. The pieces were performed live and captured as whole performances, rather than being multi-tracked. John Peel was an ardent supporter of the band's output at this time and they recorded two Peel sessions, one at the BBC Maida Vale Studios, and one at the Irish Centre in a live performance in Birmingham in 2000.|$|E
25|$|In March 2000, {{the band}} {{completed}} their debut lp I Guess Sometimes I Need to Be Reminded of How Much You Love Me, which was subsequently released by 4AD (where they remain signed today) to great critical acclaim in some quarters. The BBC {{used one of}} the tracks from this album, 'So Much As Hold My Hand', on their World Service as the theme music for links between programmes and news bulletins. Their work since this LP has included collaborations with Kim Deal and Kelley Deal, King Creosote, James Yorkston, The Mountain Goats and Sonic Boom. In 2004, Magnétophone's track 'Kel's Vintage Thought', co-written with The Breeders' Kelley Deal, was voted by listeners of BBC 6 Music as the Rebel Playlist winner on the Steve Lamacq show. Their second lp, The Man Who Ate The Man, was released in 2005 and was voted best avant-post rock lp of 2005 by Piccadilly Records. Shortly after its release, in late 2005, <b>Magnétophone</b> recorded a session for BBC Radio 1's Blue Room show at the Maida Vale Studios, and for BBC Radio 1's Rob da Bank show, both broadcast in November 2005.|$|E
25|$|<b>Magnétophone's</b> melodies, whether sung or {{played on}} an instrument, are {{supported}} by dirty, scratchy synths, solid electro and acoustic breaks, detuning guitars and sonic 'artefacts' that blink-in {{and out of the}} audio picture-frame seemingly at random. Tape hiss, projector clicks, fireworks, fragments of human voices move around sometimes contrapuntal, sometimes monophonic arrangements. The time signatures are generally 4/4 or 6/8.|$|R
25|$|Throughout <b>Magnétophone's</b> {{recorded}} output, {{the listener}} will hear sonic experimentation {{in the form}} of mis-firing beats, sliding time frames, processed acoustic field recordings, minute background 'happenings' and synthesis manipulation and these are generally presented in 'alternative' song structures. However, their most recent LP 'The Man Who Ate The Man' exhibits the sonic exploration of their early work, whilst also employing traditional acoustic instruments including guitar, drums and melodica, Anglo-folk vocal lines and song structures approaching the 'conventional'.|$|R
50|$|Keen to {{make use}} of the new {{recorders}} as soon as possible, Crosby invested $50,000 in a local electronics firm, Ampex, and the tiny six-man concern soon became the world leader in the development of tape recording. Ampex revolutionised the radio and recording industry with its famous Model 200 tape deck, developed directly from Mullin's modified <b>Magnetophones.</b> Crosby gave one of the first production models to musician Les Paul, which led directly to Paul's invention of multitrack recording.|$|R
2500|$|... 2008 {{also saw}} a new {{development}} from <b>Magnétophone</b> with the duo setting up a record label called Test Conditions to release dubstep and electronica. Saunders' solo productions are recorded under the alias of Veil and latterly The Assembled Minds.|$|E
2500|$|During this time, the duo {{sent out}} demos to record labels, {{and one in}} {{particular}} {{caught the attention of}} London label Earworm Records. 'You Should Write Music' backed by 'Monitor Rocket Science' became the band's first 7" [...] single, and prompted the change of name from Rocket Science to <b>Magnétophone.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, <b>Magnétophone</b> contributed an {{instrumental}} track called 'The Old Silver In and Out' to an online tribute compilation to classical and electronic composer György Ligeti, who scored music for Eyes Wide Shut, [...] and The Shining.

25|$|Much of <b>Magnétophone's</b> {{music from}} the early singles to the first LP is notable for its 'challenging' nature (the pounding, broken, {{distorted}} beats and unrecognisable bass textures of 'I Hear Blonde Falcons' being a case-in-point), {{and it is clear}} that the band at this stage were often concerned with creating original audio 'objects' that have questionable worth outside of pure abstract appreciation; other tracks from this time more clearly reference rock'n'roll's more simple appeal, and the balancing of these two ethics across a record creates a unique and unsettling audio and emotional experience.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Magnétophone's</b> records {{reference}} {{a number}} of different influences from Silver Apples, Suicide, My Bloody Valentine and Spacemen 3, to The Human League, Talk Talk, and Velvet Underground. However, one is not more apparent than the other and their music is more accurately a mixture of genres rather than bands: psychedelia, electronica, folk, synthpop, post-rock, ambient, pop. [...] Their sound is a meeting of [...] the broken and organic and the beautiful and systematised, and the progression of their sound through their eleven-year career, spans dysfunctional electronic instrumental pieces, to 'bewitching, mysterious' city-folk songs.|$|R
2500|$|Whichever way a <b>Magnétophone</b> {{track is}} leaning {{in terms of}} its 'influence' or 'style', there is a {{tangible}} thread of intelligent and careful boundary-searching and maverick but conscientious sound construction through it; and always towards the end of creating a slightly uncomfortable environment for a proper song to play out in. Somehow, like Francis Bacon's 'snail trail of human presence' being evident in a painting, Magnétophone's music quietly announces that they have attended there, whilst suggesting it was perhaps other people.

2500|$|<b>Magnétophone's</b> albums, 7"s and 12"s are {{visually}} impressive objects. The band state, [...] "we want our sleeves {{to be equally}} as exciting as the music they represent", and to this end, they have presented their music {{in a variety of}} quality art 'packages'. The very first single, 'You Should Write Music' consisted of a red audiophile-weight vinyl 7", with a matching textured sleeve and a single white sticker, containing the band name and track titles. Their work with V23's design-icon Vaughan Oliver and photographer/designer Chris Bigg has produced some unique sleeves, from the three-quarter cut-sleeved, double vinyl lp of 'I Guess Sometimes...', to the laser cut aluminium turntable pillar-disc that accompanied the CD version of the same LP, to the high quality cardboard, gate-folding digipack of 'The Man Who Ate The Man' which contained eight small double-sided cards, printed with domestic interior images and cryptic phrases.|$|R

2500|$|In 1928, the German {{composer}} [...] {{published a}} paper about [...] "Raummusik" [...] (spatial music), {{which is an}} entirely different sense of the term. Karlheinz Stockhausen, who became a colleague of Beyer in Cologne in 1953, used the expression [...] "space music" [...] in this sense when describing his early development as a composer: [...] "The first revolution occurred from 1952/53 as musique concrète, electronic tape music, and space music, entailing composition with transformers, generators, modulators, <b>magnetophones,</b> etc., the integration of all concrete and abstract (synthetic) possibilities within sound (also all noises) and the controlled projection of sound in space." [...] In the sense meant here, he stated in 1967, [...] "Several have commented that my electronic music sounds 'like on a different star,' or 'like in outer space.' Many have said that when hearing this music, they have sensations as if flying at an infinitely high speed, and then again, as if immobile in an immense space." ...|$|R
500|$|In December 1952, he {{composed}} a Konkrete Etüde, realized in Pierre Schaeffer's Paris musique concrète studio. In March 1953, {{he moved to}} the NWDR studio in Cologne and turned to electronic music with two Electronic Studies (1953 and 1954), and then introducing spatial placements of sound sources with his mixed concrète and electronic work Gesang der Jünglinge (1955–56). Experiences gained from the Studies made plain that it was an unacceptable oversimplification to regard timbres as stable entities [...] Reinforced by his studies with Meyer-Eppler, beginning in 1955, Stockhausen formulated new [...] "statistical" [...] criteria for composition, focussing attention on the aleatoric, directional tendencies of sound movement, [...] "the change from one state to another, with or without returning motion, as opposed to a fixed state" [...] Stockhausen later wrote, describing this period in his compositional work, [...] "The first revolution occurred from 1952/53 as musique concrète, electronic tape music, and space music, entailing composition with transformers, generators, modulators, <b>magnetophones,</b> etc; the integration of all concrete and abstract (synthetic) sound possibilities (also all noises), and the controlled projection of sound in space" [...] ( [...] , reprinted in [...] ). His position as [...] "the leading German composer of his generation" [...] was established with Gesang der Jünglinge and three concurrently composed pieces in different media: Zeitmaße for five woodwinds, Gruppen for three orchestras, and Klavierstück XI [...] The principles underlying the latter three compositions are presented in Stockhausen's best-known theoretical article, [...] "[...] [...] wie die Zeit vergeht [...] [...] [...]" [...] ("[...] [...] How Time Passes [...] [...] [...]"), first published in 1957 in vol. 3 of Die Reihe [...]|$|R
