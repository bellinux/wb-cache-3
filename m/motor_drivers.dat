50|$|At 1:30pm on 1 April 2011, a Zig Zag Railway {{maintenance}} vehicle (the Hi-Rail), {{collided with a}} two-car Rail Motor on the No 1 Viaduct, Top Road, between Clarence and Top Points stations. The Hi-Rail, with a Driver and Passenger on board, was freewheeling down the hill in reverse in the section from Clarence towards Top Points. The Rail Motor, operated by a Driver, was travelling empty {{in the opposite direction}} from Top Points. The Rail <b>Motor</b> <b>Driver</b> saw the approaching vehicle and applied the brakes. However, the two persons on board the Hi-Rail, facing the opposite direction, did not see the Rail Motor before the collision. The force of the collision compacted the body of the Hi-Rail such that neither cab door would open. The two occupants of the Hi-Rail were injured in the collision and were assisted out of the Hi-Rail and onto the Rail Motor by the Rail <b>Motor</b> <b>Driver</b> who was uninjured. The force of the collision caused a minor misalignment of the track. The investigation established that the collision resulted from the Driver of the Rail <b>Motor</b> and the <b>Driver</b> of the Hi-Rail not being aware that they were travelling towards each other on the same track in the Top Points-Clarence section. This lack of situational awareness resulted from procedural errors. The Rail <b>Motor</b> <b>Driver</b> departed Top Points without communicating his intention to his Guard or the Hi-Rail crew, and the Rail Motor Guard exceeded his authority by authorising the Hi-Rail to leave a worksite and proceed to Top Points. A number of other factors were found to have contributed to the collision, particularly a lack of radio communications and operational safeworking errors. Other safety issues identified during the investigation included delayed notification of the accident; poor maintenance of Train Register Books; passengers travelling in the Rail <b>Motor</b> <b>driver's</b> cab; Rail <b>Motor</b> <b>Driver's</b> fatigue; and excess speed of the Hi-Rail.|$|R

50|$|Targa timing (not to be {{confused}} with target timing) is a system of timing used in car rallying.

Targa timing became the standard timing method used on rallies for almost 20 years following its invention in 1963.
