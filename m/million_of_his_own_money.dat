It was then announced in January 2003 that Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Group had purchased the film rights from Warner Bros. {{in an attempt}} to produce The Phantom of the Opera independently. As a result, Lloyd Webber invested $6 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money.</b> The Phantom of the Opera was produced on a $55 million budget. A further $15 million was used for marketing, bringing the final budget to $70 million. Warner Bros. was given a first look deal for distribution; the studio did not sign on until June 2003, when the principal cast was chosen.|$|E

25|$|In May 2005, Accel Partners {{invested}} $12.7 {{million in}} Facebook, and Jim Breyer added $1 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money.</b> A high-school {{version of the}} site was launched in September 2005, which Zuckerberg called the next logical step. (At the time, high-school networks required an invitation to join.) Facebook also expanded membership eligibility to employees of several companies, including Apple Inc. and Microsoft.|$|E
25|$|The {{movement}} {{took off}} when wealthy U.S. Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican representing San Diego, California, announced on May 6 {{that he would}} use his personal money to push the effort. All told, he contributed $1.7 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money</b> to finance advertisements and professional signature-gatherers. With the movement accelerated, the recall effort began to make national news and soon appeared to be almost a sure thing. The only question was whether signatures would be collected quickly enough to force the special election {{to take place in}} late 2003 rather than in March 2004.|$|E
25|$|In September, he {{qualified}} for all 50 state ballots. On October 1, {{he announced his}} intention to re-enter the presidential race. He said that Republican operatives had wanted to reveal compromising photographs of his daughter, which would disrupt her wedding, {{and he wanted to}} spare her from embarrassment. He campaigned in 16 states and spent an estimated $12.3 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money.</b> Perot employed the innovative strategy of purchasing half-hour blocks of time on major networks for infomercial-type campaign advertisements; this advertising garnered more viewership than many sitcoms, with one Friday night program in October attracting 10.5 million viewers.|$|E
50|$|The movie spent a {{long time}} in {{pre-production}} (during which it was also known as Go North) and was delayed by the writers strike and Wayne's involvement in making The Alamo (1960), a passion project <b>of</b> <b>his</b> that ended up costing the actor <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> money.

25|$|In {{the general}} election, Bloomberg {{received}} Giuliani's endorsement. He {{also had a}} huge spending advantage. Although New York City's campaign finance law restricts the amount of contributions which a candidate can accept, Bloomberg chose not to use public campaign funds and therefore his campaign was not subject to these restrictions. He spent $73 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money</b> on his campaign, outspending Green five to one. One of the major themes of his campaign was that, with the city's economy suffering {{from the effects of}} the World Trade Center attacks, it needed a mayor with business experience.|$|E
25|$|After selling Pure Software, Hastings {{found himself}} without a goal. He became {{interested}} in educational reform in California and enrolled in the Stanford Graduate School of Education. In 2000, Governor Gray Davis appointed Hastings to the State Board of Education, and in 2001, Hastings became its president. Hastings spent $1 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money</b> together with $6 million from Silicon Valley venture capitalist John Doerr to promote the passage of Proposition 39 in November 2000, a measure that lowered the level of voter approval for local schools to pass construction bond issues from 66 to 55 percent.|$|E

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the merger meetings, Ridley focused on a compromise with the Demons Alternative to ensure that Melbourne could continue as a viable business. His board co-opted Gutnick and Mark Jenkins onto the board and a truce of sorts was struck between all parties. In the months following the 1996 merger vote, the businessman and Joseph Gutnick became president. He put $3 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money</b> into the club, and sacked Balme as coach midway through the 1997 season. In 1998, under new coach Neale Daniher, the club spent most of the season in the top eight and beat the eventual premiers Adelaide in the Qualifying Final. Melbourne also eliminated St Kilda, but lost to North Melbourne in the Preliminary Final. In 1999 Melbourne finished in the bottom three.|$|E
25|$|In April 1993, Yanni {{released}} his eighth studio album, In My Time, on the Private Music label. He supported the album with a concert tour that visited 40 cities worldwide which included three sell out performances at the Herodes Atticus Theatre by the Acropolis in Athens, Greece, his first {{to take place}} in his native country. After he moved to the United States in 1972, returning to Greece to perform at the Acropolis became one of his career goals. The event took over {{a year and a half}} to organise, and recalled his experience of meeting with the local archaeological committee, the mayor, and ministers of culture and tourism as his effort to gain their trust and permission to perform, promising not to cause any damage. For the occasion, Yanni wanted to record and film the concerts for a live album and home video. Without sufficient financial backing, Yanni risked $2 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money</b> on its production in a strategy to boost his artistic profile and open new markets for his music. Despite being advised by his management and Private Music personnel not to proceed with the concert due to the high costs, Yanni proceeded regardless and by the end of it, was left with an estimated $50,000 to his name.|$|E

500|$|Bevin financed {{his primary}} {{campaign}} with over $2.5 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money,</b> representing 95% {{of the money}} he spent, and the National Journal opined that attracting donors from supporters of Comer, Heiner, Scott, and McConnell would be critical to his success in the general election. Almost immediately after his primary win, Bevin was asked about his support for McConnell, telling reporters, [...] "I literally know of no other elected official in this state who went to more events between May and November in support of candidates and support of Mitch McConnell and other down ticket races than I did. I knocked on doors, I made phone calls, I wrote checks myself, and I physically attended fundraiser after fundraiser." [...] Federal Election Commission records showed no evidence of contributions by Bevin to McConnell's campaign, and a McConnell advisor cited by Bevin to corroborate his support refused to do so when contacted by Insider Louisville.|$|E
500|$|By mid-July, the Washington Post {{reported}} that Perot's campaign managers were becoming increasingly disillusioned by his unwillingness {{to follow their}} advice {{to be more specific}} on issues, and his need to be in full control of operations with such tactics as forcing volunteers to sign loyalty oaths. Perot's poll numbers began to slip to 25%, and his advisers warned that if he continued to ignore them, he would fall into single digits. Co-manager Hamilton Jordan threatened to quit, and on July 15, Ed Rollins resigned after Perot fired advertisement specialist Hal Riney, who worked with Rollins on the Reagan campaign. Rollins later claimed that a member of the campaign accused him of being a Bush plant with ties to the CIA. Amidst the chaos, Perot's support fell to 20%. The next day, Perot announced on Larry King Live that he would not seek the presidency. He explained {{that he did not want}} the House of Representatives to decide the election if the result caused the electoral college to be split. He asked his supporters to look for other candidates to nominate for the race, and formed United We Stand to [...] "influence the debate." [...] At this point, Perot had spent $12 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money</b> on the race. Bill Hillsman, who produced a few unaired advertisements for the campaign, wrote that Perot's withdrawal was a tactic to find temporary relief from the press.|$|E

A minor heir to the Astor fortune, Wilks entered the marriage with $2 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own,</b> enough to assure Green {{that he was not}} a gold digger.

500|$|Throughout April, {{the draft}} efforts continued, and Perot {{appeared}} on talk shows, discussing his plans and positions on political issues. During {{an appearance on}} Larry King Live, Perot stated that he was closer to a decision on a potential campaign, {{and that he was}} willing to spend $100 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money</b> to finance it. On the Today Show he was interviewed by Katie Couric, and proposed to cut Medicare and Social Security for [...] "people who don't need it". He appeared on Face the Nation later in the month, and argued that wealthy Americans should spend more than average Americans to eliminate the budget deficit. His budget numbers were contested by Tim Russert on Meet the Press, during a heated interview, after which, a frustrated Perot considered dropping out of the race. [...] C-SPAN ran a speech by Perot, where he announced that he hoped to run a campaign without [...] "political pros" [...] to avoid the [...] "dirty tricks" [...] of past campaigns. After this appearance, campaign consultant Raymond Strother explained to Perot that professionals such as pollster Mark Penn were essential to a successful campaign. In late April, Perot hired former Chicago Tribune editor James Squires as press spokesman to handle the large volume of interview requests from the media. At the end of the month, Perot realized that he had spent too much time visiting talk shows, and announced that he would spend his next few weeks focusing on the issues.|$|E
500|$|The second {{presidential debate}} {{was held on}} October 15 in Richmond, Virginia, and {{included}} questions from undecided voters, who kept the candidates focused on the issues. During his opening statement, Perot explained {{that there was a}} [...] "giant sucking sound" [...] caused by the rush of manufacturing jobs to Mexico. During one exchange, Perot commented that Democrats and Republicans were both to blame for the deficit, but that neither was willing to take responsibility. He joked [...] "somewhere out there, there's an extraterrestrial that's doing this to us, I guess." [...] At the close of the debate, Perot described himself as [...] "results... action oriented", and explained that [...] "if they want to keep slow dancing and talk about it and not do it, I'm not your man." [...] Perot took part in the third debate held in East Lansing, Michigan, on October 19. Throughout the debate, he plugged and referenced his infomercials. He criticized Bush's economic plan to start off the debate, stating that it would not balance the budget. He later remarked that he would spend $60 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money</b> to finish the race. Notably, Perot brought up the fact that [...] "both parties have foreign lobbyists on leaves and key roles in the campaigns." [...] After the debate, he ripped the media during a press conference, criticizing them for their use of [...] "gotcha" [...] stories and the lack of coverage concerning his opponent's foreign lobbyists. Former pollster Frank Luntz explained, [...] "When Ross Perot uses his head, he's unbeatable. He's focused, straightforward and compelling. When he uses his heart, sometimes his emotions get carried away." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{an effort}} speculated to implore {{the media to}} view the {{campaign}} more seriously, Trump rolled out a tax proposal that {{became the subject of}} attention. [...] In a series of telephone interviews in early November, Trump proposed a one-time 14.25 percent [...] "net worth tax" [...] that would apply to individuals and trusts with assets greater than $10 million. [...] The plan was meant to raise $5.7 trillion in revenue to wipe out the national debt, estimated at the time to be $5.66 trillion. [...] The plan exempted one's homestead from the calculation. [...] Trump estimated that the tax would only apply to one percent of the population and that the remaining 99 percent would receive a federal income tax cut as well as an elimination of the estate tax. [...] He projected a 35 to 40 percent increase in economic activity as a result and eliminate $200 billion in federal interest payments, half of which would be used to fund middle class tax cuts and the rest to allocate for Social Security. The original plan provided only one year for taxpayers to pay the new tax, but that was later increased to 10 years. [...] Economists predicted that enactment of the plan would [...] "risk capital flight" [...] and [...] "prick" [...] the stock market bubble. Bruce Bartlett of the National Center for Policy Analysis wrote in the Wall Street Journal that the proposed rate would fall short of its goal and that at any rate, would introduce [...] "devastating" [...] disruption to the economic system. Tax attorney Robert L. Sommers, writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, argued that many wealthy people lacked sufficient cash on hand to pay the tax and that doing so would lead to the mass liquidation of assets, [...] "roil the stock and real estate markets." [...] Trump defended his plan, rejecting the speculation that it would be [...] "a shock to the system." [...] Roger Stone noted that Trump had been thinking about the plan for a while and that he felt so strong about it {{that he was willing to}} pay $725 <b>million</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money</b> in taxes under it. [...] CBS News speculated that the plan meant to appeal to middle and lower class Americans. Trump's tax plan differed significantly from the plan put forward by Reform Party rival Buchanan, who had called for a 16 percent flat tax on earnings over $35,000.|$|E
5000|$|An {{alliance}} of public sector unions expended $24 million campaigning against Schwarzenegger's fiscal reform, with the California Teachers Association expending an additional $56 million and {{going so far}} as to mortgage its Sacramento headquarters to fund more campaign spending.
