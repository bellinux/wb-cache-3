2500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Clark hit a rich vein for his {{flamboyant}} clothing range. The fashion press dubbed Ossie the [...] "King of King's Road". Clark pronounced himself a [...] "master cutter. It's {{all in my}} brain and fingers and there's no-one {{in the world to}} touch me. I can do everything myself." [...] Clark's great idol was the famous dancer Nijinsky and his love of dance inspired his clothes to be free moving and not to restrict the female form. This style of dressing became quite popular in the 1970s {{thanks in large part to}} the popularity of Clark's clothing. Ossie Clark is well known for his use of muted colours and <b>moss</b> <b>crepe</b> fabric. He also designed shoes, paper dresses, and snakeskin jackets.|$|E
