By studying the literature it showed that the usage of <b>membrane</b> <b>bioreactors</b> for municipal wastewater treatment plants still has some drawbacks. Particularly the operating costs are higher than by conventional biological wastewater treatment plants, which is result of membrane exchange. Since the <b>membrane</b> <b>bioreactors</b> are not commonly used at this type of treatment plants the costs of installing the system are therefore also higher.

50|$|Anaerobic <b>membrane</b> <b>bioreactor</b> or AnMBR is {{the name}} of a {{technology}} utilized in wastewater treatment. AnMBR works by using a <b>membrane</b> <b>bioreactor</b> (MBR).

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a critical review}} about the integration of electrochemical processes into <b>membrane</b> <b>bioreactors</b> (MBR) {{in order to understand}} the influence of these processes on wastewater treatment performance and membrane fouling control. The integration can be realized either in an internal or an external configuration. Electrically enhanced <b>membrane</b> <b>bioreactors</b> or electro <b>membrane</b> <b>bioreactors</b> (eMBRs) combine biodegradation, electrochemical and membrane filtration processes into one system providing higher effluent quality as compared to conventional MBRs and activated sludge plants. Furthermore, electrochemical processes, such as electrocoagulation, electrophoresis and electroosmosis, help to mitigate deposition of foulants into the membrane and enhance sludge dewaterability by controlling the morphological properties and mobility of the colloidal particles and bulk liquid. Intermittent application of minute electric field has proven to reduce energy consumption and operational cost as well as minimize the negative effect of direct current field on microbial activity which are some of the main concerns in eMBR technology. The present review discusses important design considerations of eMBR, its advantages as well as its applications to different types of wastewater. It also presents several challenges that need to be addressed for future development of this hybrid technology which include treatment of high strength industrial wastewater and removal of emerging contaminants, optimization study, cost benefit analysis and the possible combination with microbial electrolysis cell for biohydrogen production...|$|R
50|$|Membrane fouling is {{a process}} whereby a {{solution}} or a particle is deposited on a membrane surface or in membrane pores in a process such as in a <b>Membrane</b> <b>bioreactor,</b> so that the membrane's performance is degraded. It is a major obstacle to {{the widespread use of}} this technology. Membrane fouling can cause severe flux decline and affect the quality of the water produced. Severe fouling may require intense chemical cleaning or membrane replacement. This increases the operating costs of a treatment plant. There are various types of foulants: colloidal (clays, flocs), biological (bacteria, fungi), organic (oils, polyelectrolytes, humics) and scaling (mineral precipitates).|$|E
