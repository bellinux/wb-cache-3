5000|$|Decreased {{contact between}} farmer and herd - Effective animal {{husbandry}} {{requires that the}} farmer be fully aware of herd condition. In conventional milking, the cows are observed before milking equipment is attached, and ill or injured cows can be earmarked for attention. Automatic milking removes the farmer from such close contact with the animal, with the possibility that illness may go unnoticed for longer periods and both milk quality and cow welfare suffer. In practice, milk quality sensors at the milking unit attempt to detect changes in milk due to infection, and farmers inspect the herd frequently. However this concern has meant that farmers are still tied to a seven-day schedule. Modern automatic milking systems attempt to rectify this problem by gathering data {{that would not be}} available in many conventional systems including milk temperature, milk conductivity, milk color including infrared scan, change in milking speed, change in milking time or <b>milk</b> <b>letdown</b> by quarter, cow's weight, cow's activity (movements), time spent ruminating, etc.|$|E
5000|$|In pigs, {{dominance}} hierarchies can {{be formed}} {{at a very}} early age. Domestic piglets are highly precocious and within minutes of being born, or sometimes seconds, will attempt to suckle. The piglets are born with sharp teeth and fight to develop a teat order as the anterior teats produce a greater quantity of milk. Once established, this teat order remains stable with each piglet tending to feed from a particular teat or group of teats. [...] Stimulation of the anterior teats appears to be important in causing <b>milk</b> <b>letdown</b> so it might be advantageous to the entire litter to have these teats occupied by healthy piglets.Using an artificial sow to rear groups of piglets, recognition of a teat in a particular area of the udder depended initially on visual orientation by means of reference points on the udder to find the area, and then the olfactory sense for the more accurate search within that area.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{parturition}} (childbirth), {{estrogen and}} progesterone rapidly drop to very low levels, with progesterone levels being undetectable, while prolactin levels remain elevated. As estrogen and progesterone block prolactin-induced lactogenesis, by suppressing prolactin receptor (PRLR) expression in breast tissue, specifically, their sudden absence {{results in the}} commencement of milk production and lactation by prolactin. Expression of the PRLR in breast tissue may increase {{by as much as}} 20-fold when estrogen and progesterone levels drop upon childbirth. With suckling from the infant, prolactin and oxytocin are secreted and mediate <b>milk</b> production and <b>letdown,</b> respectively. Prolactin suppresses the secretion of LH and FSH, which in turn results in continued low levels of estrogen and progesterone, and temporary amenorrhea (absence of menstrual cycles) occurs. In the absence of regular, episodic suckling, which keeps prolactin concentrations high, levels of prolactin will quickly drop, the menstrual cycle will resume and hence normal estrogen and progesterone levels will return, and lactation will cease (that is, until next parturition, or until induced lactation (i.e., with a galactogogue), occurs).|$|R
5000|$|When {{it became}} {{necessary}} to milk larger cows, the cows {{would be brought}} to a shed or barn that was set up with stalls (milking stalls) where the cows could be confined while they were milked. One person could milk more cows this way, as many as 20 for a skilled worker. But having cows standing about {{in the yard and}} shed waiting to be milked is not good for the cow, as she needs as much time in the paddock grazing as is possible. It is usual to restrict the twice-daily milking to a maximum of {{an hour and a half}} each time. It makes no difference whether one milks 10 or 1000 cows, the milking time should not exceed a total of about three hours each day for any cow as they should be in stalls and laying down as long as possible to increase comfort which will in turn aid in milk production. A cow is only physically milked for about 10 minutes a day depending on her <b>milk</b> <b>letdown</b> time and the amount of milkings per day.|$|E

In this study, a conditional knockout allele {{has been developed}} in Mus musculus to further characterize these known functions of Peg 3 in a tissue-specific manner. The mutant line was first crossed with a germline Cre. The progeny of this cross displayed growth retardation phenotypes.

40|$|Background: Infants ’ fussiness on {{the breast}} {{is a common}} {{lactation}} problem that can proceed to complete breastfeeding refusal if not professionally handled. Aim of work: To study the factors associated with infants ’ fussiness while breastfeeding {{and the effect of}} proper lactation counselling on the breastfeeding outcome. Subjects and methods: This is an interventional study conducted in the breastfeeding clinic of the Cairo university children’s hospital. Forty-six fussy infants were recruited. Personal interview together with assessment of the act of breastfeeding were done for each mother-infant dyad. The mothers’ <b>milk</b> <b>letdown</b> was assessed by manual expression. Intervention was done by proper lactation counselling, guided by the WHO/UNICEF breastfeeding counselling training course. Results: 28 (61 %) of the mothers had forceful <b>milk</b> <b>letdown</b> versus 9 (19. 5 %) having average letdown and 9 (19. 5 %) having inhibited letdown (p< 0. 01). 13 infants were using pacifiers, which was stopped in 10 of them (p= 0. 01), 8 infants received formula and 5 mothers were smokers and all couldn’t stop smoking. Upon counselling, 37 infants continued breastfeeding without fussiness and 9 stopped it (p< 0. 01). The greatest success was accomplished in mothers having forceful letdown (p= 0. 0001) and average letdown (p= 0. 01), rather than those having inhibited letdown (p= 0. 57). 19 of the 37 mothers having acceptable let down were presenting with perceived low milk supply and only 3 remained unconvinced (p< 0. 01). 46. 2 % of pacifier users, 100 % of formula users and 80 % of infants of smoker mothers quitted breastfeeding. Conclusion & Recommendations: Forceful <b>milk</b> <b>letdown</b> is commonly associated with fussiness on the breast with good outcome if properly managed.

40|$|The {{particular}} morphology {{of buffalo}} udder is associated to milking difficulties. To {{better understand the}} characteristics of milk ejection in buffaloes, a {{study was conducted in}} an intensive farm in Lombardy, Italy. A total of 184 milk flow profiles were measured with an electronic flow meter. The results showed that during the first 3 minutes of milking 73 % of total milk yield was milked; lag time of milk ejection (1. 94 min ± 1. 57) was very long and increased significantly with the increasing of lactation stage. The overmilking phase has also a long duration (33 % of total milking time, on average).

40|$|AbstractCross-fostering is the {{transference}} of piglets to equalise {{litter size}} {{according to the}} birth weight. In many commercial farms piglets are usually grouped in litters with 100 % adopted piglets. The aim of the experiment {{was to assess the}} behaviour of piglets during the suckling period as well as to assess their performance and mortality rate up to weaning in litters with different composition in terms of adopted and biological piglets. Three treatments were studied: 100 B (100 % biological piglets, n= 13), 50 B 50 A (50 % biological piglets and 50 % adopted piglets, n= 13) and 100 A (100 % adopted piglets, n= 13). All litters were standardised to eleven piglets on average within 20. 1 ± 0. 4 h (14. 3 – 24. 7 h) of birth. The behaviour of piglets was recorded during four consecutive sucklings for four days (days 1, 2, 4 and 6 after farrowing, considering day 1 as the cross-fostering day). The observations were performed at two time periods: TP 1 (from release of piglets out of creep box until <b>milk</b> <b>letdown)</b> and TP 2 (from the end of <b>milk</b> <b>letdown</b> up to 15 min later). Piglets were weighed at days 1, 4, 7, 10, 13 and 16. There were no differences (P> 0. 05) among the treatments in the following behavioural variables: percentage of missed nursing episodes; number of fights for teats and percentage of piglets involved in fights at TP 1; percentage of piglets vocalising at TP 1 and at TP 2; number of fights per piglet elsewhere in the cage and percentage of piglets involved in these fights; number of instances of playful behaviour per piglet and percentage of piglets involved in it.

30|$|Participants in the FGD {{identified}} the main challenges in achieving clean milk production and marketing as (i) insufficient water availability during the camel milking process, (ii) milk contamination arising from saliva of the calf during suckling to initiate <b>milk</b> <b>letdown</b> prior to milking and (iii) use of plastic containers for milking, storage and transportation that {{are generally not}} easy to clean and therefore cause milk spoilage, despite washing with hot water.

The conventional milking cluster had a claw volume of 150 mL and a weight of 3. 16 kg. The single sets of teatcups were applied manually and removed automatically when milk flow from the four teatcups reached 0. 2 kg/min. The experiment involved a latin square design with four groups of Friesian cows (10 cows/group), four 2 -day periods and four treatments. At a flow rate of 4 L/min during simulated milking the mean vacuum level at the teat-end (artificial teat) during the “bphase” of pulsation was 43. 8 kPa with the conventional milking unit and 33 kPa for the three single-teatcup units.

Evaluate the relationship between various neuropsychiatric disorders and oxytocin. 3. Identify clinical implications of using oxytocin to treat various neuropsychiatric disorders. Oxytocin is a peptide hormone integral in parturition, <b>milk</b> <b>letdown,</b> and maternal behaviors that has been demonstrated in animal studies to be important in the formation of pair bonds and in social behaviors. This hormone is increasingly recognized as an important regulator of human social behaviors, including social decision making, evaluating and responding to social stimuli, mediating social interactions, and forming social memories. In addition, oxytocin is intricately involved in a broad array of neuropsychiatric functions and may be a common factor important in multiple psychiatric disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, and mood and anxiety disorders. This review article examines the extant literature on the evidence for oxytocin dysfunction in a variety of psychiatric disorders and highlights the need for further research to understand the complex role of the oxytocin system in psychiatric disease and thus pave the way for developing new therapeutic modalities.

40|$|Oxytocin is {{a hormone}} well know for the {{stimulation}} of childbirth and <b>milk</b> <b>letdown</b> in mammals. Large {{levels of the}} hormone are also released during angiogenesis {{in the growth of}} the corpus luteum (CL), a temporary endocrine gland that forms on the ovaries following ovulation. Levels of oxytocin decline after the CL is fully formed, on Days 7 & 8 of the bovine estrous cycle. The exact mechanism of the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells during angiogenesis is unknown. Further interest into the growth of the CL stems from two reasons as follows: 1) Inhibition of the ability of the CL's production of progesterone, a hormone necessary for the uterus to maintain a pregnancy, and 2) the striking similarity in the growth of the CL to tumors, which undergo angiogenesis in order to metastasize. The following study focuses on whether oxytocin binds specifically to receptors in endothelial cells of the growing bovine CL which were removed on day 8 of the estrous cycle from the five heifers. Endothelial cells were isolated using tosyl-activated magnetic beads bearing lectin BS- 1 which binds specifically to receptors on bovine endothelial cells. Samples of endothelial cell and non-endothelial cell membranes were exposed to [³H]-oxytocin or to [³H]-oxytocin with 200 fold excess of unlabeled oxytocin to determine whether oxytocin binding was occurring to receptors. The results showed slight binding to endothelial cells, however, it was the non-endothelial cells that appeared to contain greater quantity of oxytocin receptors...|$|E
40|$|Oxytocin (OXT) is a neuropeptide {{synthesized}} in the hypothalamus {{and stored}} in the posterior pituitary gland. Its most known functions include {{being involved in the}} stimulation of the uterus during childbirth and allowing for <b>milk</b> <b>letdown</b> in the process of lactation after birth. OXT has also been implicated {{to play a role in}} parental care and sex behavior. Specific binding to brain oxytocin receptors (OXTR) was observed by in vitro receptor autoradiography with an iodinated OXT analogue in the monogamous prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) and the polygamous montane vole (Microtus montanus). What was found was that OXTR density in the prairie vole was highest in the prelimbic cortex, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, nucleus accumbens, midline nucleus of the thalamus, and the lateral amygdala. In contrast, OXTR density in the montane vole was highest in the lateral septum, ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, and cortical nucleus of the amygdala. Prairie voles show a high level of parental care in both naïve and postpartum individuals, whereas montane voles show a much higher level of parental care postpartum. Differences in OXTR distribution were also seen in two additional species of voles, the monogamous pine vole (Microtus pinetorum) and the polygamous meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus). The receptor distribution of two other neurotransmitter systems that play a role in the mediation of social behavior (benzodiazepines and µ opioids) were also studied but showed little comparable differences between monogamous and polygamous species, which further highlights the importance of OXTR distribution as a mediator of social behavior...|$|E
40|$|Background & objectives: Oxytocin (OT) {{injections}} to milch cattle for <b>milk</b> <b>letdown</b> {{have become}} a common practice amongst dairy farmers in India. Although there is no reported evidence, it is widely presumed that long term consumption of such milk leads to adverse health consequences. However, there is no information {{on the effect of}} exogenous OT injections on milk OT content and its stability during heating and gastrointestinal digestion. This study was carried out to determine the OT content in milk samples given by buffaloes with and without OT injections and to assess the stability of OT in the milk. Methods: Milk samples from milch buffaloes (Murrah buffalo) were collected from local farmers with (n= 121) or without (n= 120) exogenous OT injections during 3 to 5 months of lactation period. The OT content of milk samples was estimated by competitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA). The thermal and digestive stability of OT was assessed by in silico and in vitro digestion methods. Results: The OT content of the milk samples was similar regardless of OT injections used. Further, OT was found to be stable to heat treatment and gastric pepsin digestion while it was rapidly digested during the simulated intestinal digestion. r 0 educed OT was digested by pepsin, implying that internal disulphide bridge of OT rendered the peptide resistant to peptic digestion. On the other hand, phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF), a serine protease inhibitor, abrogated the pancreatin induced digestion of OT. Interpretation & conclusions: These findings suggest that exogenous OT injections do not influence its content in milk. Further, OT present in milk is rapidly degraded during intestinal digestion, ruling out its intestinal absorption and associated adverse health consequences, if any...|$|E

To date there are no published studies of OT binding sites during pregnancy in the pig. The purpose of the present study is to improve understanding of the role of OT in porcine parturition. The concentration and affinity of OT binding sites were determined for myometrium and endometri-um from pregnant and postpartum gilts. Tissues were obtained after slaughter from 7 animals in each of four groups: 1) 90 days gestation, 2) 112 days gestation, 3) term after <b>milk</b> <b>letdown</b> (be-fore delivery), and 4) within 1 - 3 h after farrowing. Mammary tissues were obtained for some animals in each group (n = 3 - 5 /group). Before slaughter, blood was collected from each ani-mal and assayed for estradiol- 1 7,, progesterone, 13, 1 4 -dihydro- 15 -keto-prostaglandin F 2,, (PGFM), and OT. Binding of 3 H-OT in the three tissues was concentration- and time-dependent. Sites of 3 H-OT binding (fmol/mg protein SEM) increased toward term for each tissue and remained elevated in the postpartum group. Endometrial and mammary tissues displayed the most acute increases in OT binding site concentrations while myo-metrial tissues displayed a more gradual increase in OT binding sites over the times studied. The binding sites displayed high affinity for 3 H-OT and were characterized by linear Scatchard plots. Concentrations of estradiol- 1 7 p, PGFM, and OT (pg/ml + SEM) were positively correlated with 3 H-OT binding site con-centrations, whereas progestrone concentrations (ng/ml ± SEM) were negatively correlated with binding site concentration, as determined by Pearson's Correlation Analysis.

Measurements of udder and teat morphology were obtained immediately before milking and in duplicate. Individual milk yield, lag time and total milking time were recorded during milking, and milk samples were collected and analyzed for milk composition thereafter. Cisternal and alveolar milk volumes and composition were evaluated at 9 h milking interval. Results revealed that dairy camels had well developed udders and milk veins, with medium sized teats. On average, milk yield as well as milk fat and protein contents were 4. 80 ± 0. 50 L d- 1, 2. 61 ± 0. 16 % and 3. 08 ± 0. 05 %, respectively. The low fat values observed indicated incomplete <b>milk</b> <b>letdown</b> during machine milking. Lag time, and total milking time were 3. 0 ± 0. 3, and 120. 0 ± 8. 9 s, on average, respectively. Positive correlations (p < 0. 05) were observed between milk yield and udder depth (r = 0. 37), distance between teats (r = 0. 57) and milk vein diameter (r = 0. 28), while a negative correlation was found with udder height (r = - 0. 25, p < 0. 05).

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of increased growth of small piglets following split weaning were studied using {{a total of}} 10 sows and 100 piglets. Sows and their litters were allocated to a treatment group (piglets split-weaned) or control group (no piglets split-weaned). At day 22 of lactation, piglets in each litter were classified as either 'heavy' or 'light', with equal numbers in each group. 'Heavy' piglets were removed from sows at day 22 (s. e. m. 0. 17) in split-weaned litters while 'light' piglets remained with their mothers for an extra week. At 29. 5 (s. e. m. 0. 21) days of age, sows from both split-weaned and control litters were weaned. Milk consumption was estimated between days 16 and 19 and on day 24 of lactation by weighing piglets before and after sucking. During <b>milk</b> <b>letdown,</b> the teats that piglets sucked from were noted. A video recorder {{was used to determine}} the frequency of natural sucklings, the proportion of unsuccessful sucklings, and the time taken for piglets to consume milk during ejection, over a 16 -h period before and after split weaning. 'Light' piglets in split-weaned litters grew 61 % faster (P < 0. 001) than their counterparts in control litters and were 15 % heavier (P < 0. 01) at weaning. This was explained by a 49 % increase in milk intake (64 v. 43 g/sucking, P 5 0. 001). Increased milk intake was due to multiple teat swapping with an associated longer duration of sucking during letdown. 'Heavy' piglets weaned at 22 days were lighter at 29 days than their counterparts in control litters (P < 0. 01). Gains in growth made by 'light' piglets in split-weaned sows over their counterparts in control litters had disappeared by the time pigs were 9 weeks old, and piglets classed as 'heavy' at day 22 of lactation remained heavier (P < 0. 001) at 62 days of age irrespective of treatment...|$|E

Research Assistant Professor, Department of Animal Products, Karaj Animal Science Research Institue, Karaj, Iran 3. MSc in Biotechnology, Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, Hamadan Bou Ali University, Hamadan, Iran Abstract Background: The primary {{quality of}} raw milk is {{affected}} by several factors including animal nutrition, animal health, milk components, and its bacterial activity and these factors are effective on the final products. Therefore, the quality of raw milk depends on time and milk condition from production to delivery. In Lorestan, 97 % of the milk production is obtained from rural and small units. This study was carried out to determine the factors affecting the bacteriological quality of raw milk from letdown phase till delivery to factory {{and to find out}} the critical points of bacterial contamination in the years 2003 and 2004. Materials and methods: In this study, the collecting centers of raw milk with a capacity of more than 3 tons, between 1. 5 to 3 tons, and fewer than 1. 5 tons were included as the centers with high, moderate, and low capacity respectively. The sampling stages consisted of cow <b>milk</b> <b>letdown,</b> milk collecting equipment, milk collecting tankers, milk cooling tanks, and milk delivery to factory. Microbial experiments consisted of standard plate count (SPC), E. coli, and coliforms. All the collected samples were 45 ones in each month and 540 samples in a year. Being converted to Log 10, the data were analyzed by the SPSS software (version 11. 5) and GLM procedure was used {{to determine the effects of}} month, capacity of centers, and sampling stages. Results: Based on the results of the study, the average total count (TC) in all seasons in Lorestan province was 6. 43 0. 37 cfu/m. The effects of month, capacity of centers, and the sampling stages on TC, E. coli, and coliforms were statistically significant (p< 0. 01). Additionally, the lowest TC (6. 31 0. 38 cfu/m) was in January while the highest (6. 57 0. 31 cfu/m) was in August. Moreover, the decreasing trend of TC started from September and was the lowest in January and February. Correlation coefficients showed that there was a significant positive correlation between TC and E. coli (r= 0. 79) and TC and coliforms (r= 0. 90, p< 0. 01). Conclusion: The major problems of milk collecting in Lorestan province are the long distances of some milk collecting centers from the milk factories as well as the long milk delivery time which play important roles in increasing TC from letdown stage till delivery to factory in addition to the insufficient road facilities in some of the villages in Lorestan province...|$|E
