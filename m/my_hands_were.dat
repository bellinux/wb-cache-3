500|$|The band parted {{ways with}} Interscope on December 3. On parting with the label, Manson said: [...] "a {{lot of the}} {{creative}} control on which <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> tied [...] ", and indicated that the band had started work on new material while touring. He also confirmed that he had rekindled his relationship with Wood. The band's long-time drummer Ginger Fish stepped down {{as a member of}} Marilyn Manson in February 2011.|$|E
500|$|Kinsler was {{promoted}} two levels on June 12 to the Double-A Frisco RoughRiders. [...] "When I first got called up, {{there were a}} million things running through my head", he said. [...] "I was nervous, <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> sweating. It was really exciting, but I didn't know what to expect. I was a little nervous that ... {{all of a sudden}} I wouldn't be able to hit." [...] In June he was named the Rangers' Minor League Player of the Month. Frisco manager Tim Ireland observed: I think he's succeeding because his swing is graceful and effortless. It's just a smooth swing, and he hits for power because he lets his swing work for him. Defensively, so far he's shown a real feel for shortstop. He's got good feet and soft hands, and he throws well enough.... He seems pretty legit to me. In July, the Rangers agreed to send Kinsler and prospect right-hander Erik Thompson to the Colorado Rockies for Larry Walker, but Walker vetoed the trade.|$|E
500|$|In 1963 Waldron {{had a major}} {{breakdown}} caused by a heroin overdose. He recounted in 1998 {{that a lot of}} musicians in the 1950s and 1960s felt that taking drugs was necessary for career progression. The police assumed they were all doing it, according to Waldron: The police would stop the musicians and search us as we came out of the clubs after work. We had to turn our pockets inside out. After a while, the musicians thought ... well, if you have the name you might as well have the game. Eventually, I overdosed. I couldn't remember my own name. <b>My</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> trembling, I couldn't play the piano. I needed shock treatments and a spinal tap to bring me back. [...] Waldron always felt that he had to return to playing, but this was a slow process. About a year after the overdose, his physical recovery was sufficient to allow him to start relearning his skills, which he did partly by listening to his own records. His recovery as a musician continued for another two years, as his speed of thought was still too slow over that period to allow genuine improvisation: [...] "I worked out my solos in advance and played what I had written out, until gradually all my faculties returned".|$|E

2500|$|Dissatisfied {{with the}} results of her efforts, Nation began to pray to God for direction. On June 5, 1900, she felt she {{received}} her answer {{in the form of a}} heavenly vision. As she described it:The next morning I was awakened by a voice which seemed to me speaking in my heart, these words, [...] "GO TO KIOWA," [...] and <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> lifted and thrown down and the words, [...] "I'LL STAND BY YOU." [...] The words, [...] "Go to Kiowa," [...] were spoken in a murmuring, musical tone, low and soft, but [...] "I'll stand by you," [...] was very clear, positive and emphatic. I was impressed with a great inspiration, the interpretation was very plain, it was this: [...] "Take something in your hands, and throw at these places in Kiowa and smash them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following Adams' speech, {{attendees}} {{created the}} first pile of small bicycles. One participant, {{who was one of}} the first women of Zoobomb, said about the creation of the first new pile: [...] "I pushed through the crowd and handed it forth, bowing in honor of the golden b(eye)cycle winking in the sun. As I retreated to the crowd, my whole body was shaking. <b>My</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> in disbelief. I paced in a circle and half-sigh/half-laughed and this darn smile was holding me so tight, I felt like the kiln was burning it into my clay, smile-shaped cheeks forever." [...] A long chain was wrapped through each of the nearly twenty bicycles, which were locked to the sculpture by Adams. Event attendees then posed for a group picture, then sang a song called [...] "16" [...] Rims", a parody of Janis Joplin's [...] "Mercedez Benz". The commemoration ended with [...] "dancing in the streets" [...] and music by The Sprockettes.|$|E
2500|$|Cooper's dream {{at the end}} of {{the third}} episode, which became a driving plot point in the series's first season and {{ultimately}} held the key to the identity of Laura's murderer, was never scripted. The idea came to Lynch one afternoon after touching the side of a hot car left out in the sun: [...] "I was leaning against a car—the front of me was leaning against this very warm car. <b>My</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> on the roof and the metal was very hot. The Red Room scene leapt into my mind. 'Little Mike' was there, and he was speaking backwards... For the rest of the night I thought only about The Red Room." [...] The footage was originally shot along with the pilot, to be used as the conclusion were it to be released as a feature film. When the series was picked up, Lynch decided to incorporate some of the footage; in the third episode, Cooper, narrating the dream, outlines the shot footage which Lynch did not incorporate, such as Mike shooting Bob and the fact that he is 25 years older when he meets Laura Palmer's spirit.|$|E

2500|$|Upon parting with Interscope, Manson said [...] "a {{lot of the}} {{creative}} control on which <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> tied [...] ", while stating that the band had been writing new material while touring their previous album. At the beginning of 2010, Vrenna {{said that they were}} [...] "talking and coming up with concepts" [...] for their upcoming studio album. Manson attested that its lyrical content would be [...] "more romantic" [...] yet [...] "self-abusive", and described its sonic elements as being [...] "suicide death metal". That April, Manson expressed interest in releasing the record in a different way from previous ones. Fred Sablan – bassist for Twiggy and Masters of Reality vocalist Chris Goss' project Goon Moon – joined the band in July. By October, Twiggy described the album as being [...] "almost done", and opined that [...] "It's our best record yet. I mean, everyone always says that, but I think this is our best work so far. It's kind of like a little more of a punk rock Mechanical Animals, without sounding too pretentious." [...] The following month, it was announced that the band had signed a joint-venture deal with London-based indie label Cooking Vinyl. As part of the deal, the band would retain creative control over their artistic direction, with the band and label sharing profits equally after the label recoups costs associated with marketing, promotion and distribution.|$|E
