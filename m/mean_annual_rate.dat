40|$|Purpose: To {{document}} {{the number of}} journal publications attributed to the academic faculty of Australian chiropractic tertiary institutions. To provide {{a discussion of the}} significance of this output and to relate this to the difficulty the profession appears to be experiencing in the uptake of evidence based healthcare outcomes and cultures. Methods: The departmental websites for the three Australian chiropractic tertiary institutions were accessed and a list of academic faculty compiled. It was noted whether each academic held a chiropractic qualification or research Doctoral (not professional) degree qualification A review of the literature was conducted using the names of the academics and cross-referencing to publications listed independently in the PubMed and Index to Chiropractic Literature (ICL) databases (from inception to February 27 2006). Publications were excluded that were duplicates, corrected reprints, conference abstracts/proceedings, books, monographs, letters to the editor/comments or editorials. Using this information an annual and recent publication rate was constructed. Results: For the 41 academics there was a total of 155 PubMed listed publications (<b>mean</b> 3. 8, <b>annual</b> <b>rate</b> per academic 0. 31) and 415 ICL listed publications (<b>mean</b> 10. 1, <b>annual</b> <b>rate</b> 0. 62). Over the last five years there have been 50 PubMed listed publications (<b>mean</b> 1. 2, <b>annual</b> <b>rate</b> 0. 24) and 97 ICL listed publications (<b>mean</b> 2. 4, <b>annual</b> <b>rate</b> 0. 47). Chiropractor academics (n = 31) had 29 PubMed listed publications (<b>mean</b> 2. 5, <b>annual</b> <b>rate</b> 0. 27) and 265 ICL listed publications (<b>mean</b> 8. 5, <b>annual</b> <b>rate</b> 0. 57). Academics with a doctoral degree (n = 13) had 134 PubMed listed publications (<b>mean</b> 10. 3, <b>annual</b> <b>rate</b> 0. 70) and 311 ICL listed publications (<b>mean</b> 23. 9, <b>annual</b> <b>rate</b> 1. 44). Academics without a Doctoral degree (n = 28) had 21 PubMed listed publications (<b>mean</b> 0. 8, <b>annual</b> <b>rate</b> 0. 13) and 104 ICL listed publications (<b>mean</b> 3. 7, <b>annual</b> <b>rate</b> 0. 24). Conclusion: While several academics have compiled an impressive list of publications, overall there is a significant paucity of published research authored by the majority of academics, with a trend for a falling recent publication rate and not having a doctoral degree being a risk factor for poor publication productivity. It is suggested that there is an urgent necessity to facilitate the acquisition of research skills in academic staff particularly in research methods and publication skills. Only when undergraduate students are exposed to an institutional environment conducive to and fostering research will concepts of evidence based healthcare really be appreciated and implemented by the profession. 13 page(s...|$|R

These variations could not be explained by differences in access to and use of diagnostic services, surveillance, or host susceptibility (as reflected by socioeconomic status and frequency of other respiratory disease). The explanation probably lay in environmental factors, though differences in agent virulence were not excluded. The two main conclusions are, that non-outbreak cases were not truly sporadic, and that the space-time variations in incidence support the hypothesis that cooling towers were an important source of infection for non-travel, non-outbreak cases.

40|$|Based on {{previous}} climate model simulations of a split {{of the polar}} jet stream during the late Pleistocene, we hypothesize that (1) 20 - 13. 5 ka BP, season-toseason variation in the latitudinal maximum of the jet stream core led to enhanced wetness in the Great Basin, and (2) after 13. 5 ka BP, northward movement of the jet stream resulted in increased aridity similar to today. We suggest that the enhanced effective wetness was due to increased precipitation combined with an energylimited reduction in evaporation rates that was caused by increased summer cloud cover. A physically based thermal evaporation model was used to simulate evaporation for Lake Lahontan under various hypothesized paleoclimates. The simulated evaporation rates, together with hypothetical rates of precipitation and discharge, were input to a water balance model of Lake Lahontan. A 42 % reduction in evaporation rate, combined with maximum historical rates of precipitation (1. 8 times the <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> <b>rate)</b> and discharge (2. 4 times the <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> <b>rate),</b> were sufficient to maintain Lake Lahontan at its 20 - 15 ka BP level.

To investigate these factors, California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, {{in conjunction with}} the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) and California State University, Sacramento, conducted a study of these factors’ affect on vegetation establishment. The goal was to identify initially fast growing vegetation that demonstrates long-term erosion control effectiveness. Native plant species common to District 5, along the California Central Coast, were used. Treatments were conducted in 0. 6 by 2 m by 30 cm soil test boxes set at a 2 : 1 (H:V) slope. Boxes were filled with a medium sandy loam soil (USDA), typical of District 5 fill slopes, compacted to 90 percent. Erosion control treatments included combinations of imprinted straw and hydroseeding of fiber, fertilizer, and tackifier. All boxes were planted with the same native seed mix that included shrubs, forbs, and grasses. Norton Ladder rainfall simulators were used to simulate natural rainfall patterns found in the area. The rainfall regimes applied were natural precipitation, 53. 3 cm (21 in/yr during the study period) and uniform rainfall at the <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> <b>rate,</b> 56 cm (22 in/yr), half the <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> <b>rate,</b> 28 cm(11 in/yr) and double the <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> <b>rate,</b> 111 cm (44 in/yr). The rainfall simulators mimicked rainfall characteristics for the California coast, such as drop size distribution, terminal velocity and a range of storm intensities. In all, 24 boxes were established and treated under rainfall simulators, eight additional boxes were subjected to natural rainfall, and two more boxes were untreated (bare soil). Percent cover and runoff quality (measured as Suspended Sediment Concentration) were measured for each box. The boxes treated with straw and fertilizer showed greater percent cover than those treated with tackifier and no fertilizer. The ANOVA results indicated that this effect statistically significant to a high degree (p=. 001). The effect on runoff was marginally significant (p=. 048). Runoff volume was greatest on the heavy rainfall treatments. Higher rainfall treatments showed an increase in the quantity of the native plants of yarrow (Achillea millefolium), lupine (Lupinus succulentus), and California brome (Bromus carinatus).

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to analyse the {{position}} of Slovakia and the Czech Republic in the European Union from the viewpoint of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. Econometric models for panel data with CO 2 emissions as the dependent variable and four different types of macroeconomic aggregates are employed in the study. The EU- 27 data used in the study supports the hypothesis of the EKC. As the EU countries are heterogeneous, the countries are further classified into “rich” and “poor” (according to the level of their GDP), and further analyses are performed. Considering the “rich” EU countries the EKC hypothesis holds, but if the “poor” EU countries are taken into account, the coefficient of the quadratic regressor is positive which relates to the traditional U-shaped curve, not the inverted one. Such a finding is still not in contradiction to the EKC hypothesis, as it assumes that at the low level of economic output, as the development progresses, the emissions increase. The estimated value of the EKC turning point is 19 660 USD (constant 2000 USD) which has not been reached by the “poor” EU countries yet. As for the position of Slovakia and the Czech Republic in the EU, the results are not unambiguous.

40|$|A {{procedure}} {{for the evaluation}} of the seismic risk of damaged structures due aftershocks is here proposed with the aim to provide a tool for deciding whether, after a damaging mainshock, a structure can still be open for either emergency or ordinary traffic. In particular the <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> <b>rate</b> of collapse of a mainshock-damaged structure due to aftershocks is calculated using the probabilistic aftershock hazard theory and calculating the fragility curves with IDA technique. The novelty of the procedure consists in using the in-situ inspection results in order to updated the fragility curves by Bayes theorem. For this purpose the correlation values between the observed damage and the drift available in literature has been used. An application to a highway r. c. bridge has shown the effectiveness of the procedure...|$|E

Starling {{density in}} the mid- 1990 s {{was positively correlated}} with dairy cattle abundance in 13 local areas. Regional declines in Starling abundance between 2001 and 2014 were positively correlated with loss of high intensity grazing pressure by dairy cattle, as more animal husbandry moved indoors. The long-term decline in national Starling abundance {{was positively correlated with}} the long term numbers of dairy cattle grazing outdoors. This study therefore confirms that not only does the extent of available grassland to breeding Starlings affect their relative abundance, but that the intensity of grazing of these grasslands is also of importance...|$|E

In this paper, we develop Carbon Man-agement Response (CMR) curves that could be used as an alternative to in situ measurements. The CMR curves devel-oped here are based on quantitative reviews of existing global analyses and field observations of changes in soil carbon. The curves show <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> <b>rates</b> of soil carbon change, esti-mated time to maximum rates of change, and estimated time to a new soil carbon steady state following the initial change in management. We illustrate how CMR curves could be used in a carbon accounting framework while effectively addressing...|$|R

Estimated <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> <b>rates</b> of net primary production were 38 g C m super(- 2) in sand, 53 g C m super(- 2) in fine sand, and 21 g C m super(- 2) in silt. The authors tested the hypotheses that benthic algal primary production dynamics were controlled by sediment type, tidal height, and season. Results show that there is a relationship between these physical factors and benthic algal production dynamics...|$|R
