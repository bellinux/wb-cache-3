I just can’t conceive of how a person could hate another because of skin color. I love every race on the planet earth. Prejudice is the child of ignorance.

500|$|While on tour Madonna {{participated in}} the Raising Malawi {{initiative}} by partially funding an orphanage in and traveling to that country. While there, she decided to adopt a boy named David Banda in October 2006. The adoption raised strong public reaction, because Malawian law requires would-be parents to reside in Malawi for one year before adopting, which Madonna did not do. She addressed this on The Oprah Winfrey Show, saying {{that there were no}} written adoption laws in Malawi that regulated foreign adoption. She described how Banda had been suffering from pneumonia after surviving malaria and tuberculosis when she first met him. Banda's biological father, Yohane, commented, [...] "These so-called human rights activists are harassing me every day, threatening <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not aware of what I am doing ... They want me to support their court case, a thing I cannot do for I know what I agreed with Madonna and her husband." [...] The adoption was finalized in May 2008.|$|E

[...] Weinberg became the live drummer for 10,000 Maniacs in 1992 after their drummer Jerry Augustyniak was injured five days before a five-week tour. He went after that {{assignment}} once he heard it was open and later said, [...] "I lived on a bus and had a roommate. Not exactly like the E Street Band, but I loved it. It reminded <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a drummer and I'm good. I was put here to play the drums. To {{turn my back on}} that ability was wrong." [...] He played at the January 1993 inauguration of Bill Clinton. Weinberg auditioned in 1993 to be the principal drummer on the Broadway show The Who's Tommy, but was selected instead as the second substitute. Despite the very low pay, Weinberg was nevertheless happy: [...] "I'd buried drumming so far into my psyche. I felt I'd resurrected it." [...] Of Springsteen's work, Weinberg felt [...] "that I would never get to play these songs again." ...|$|E

2500|$|But Maugham's {{homosexuality}} or bisexuality {{is believed}} to have shaped his fiction in two ways. Since he tended to see attractive women as sexual rivals, he often gave his women characters sexual needs and appetites, in a way quite unusual for authors of his time. Liza of Lambeth, Cakes and Ale, The Painted Veil, Neil MacAdam and The Razor's Edge all featured women determined to feed their strong sexual appetites, heedless of the result. As Maugham's sexual appetites were then officially disapproved of, or criminal, in nearly all of the countries in which he travelled, the author was unusually tolerant of the vices of others. Some readers and critics complained that Maugham did not condemn what was bad in the villains of his fiction and plays. Maugham replied: [...] "It must be a fault in <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not gravely shocked at the sins of others unless they personally affect me." ...|$|E

He said he would consider reversing his decision after the World Cup. Afridi had played ten Tests since being recalled to the side in January 2005, averaging 47.44 with the bat including four centuries. However, on 27 April he reversed his decision, saying that [...] " [...] told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> one of the main players in the team and squad and that Pakistan really needed me". Before Pakistan toured England in July to September, Afridi played for Ireland as an overseas player in the C Trophy. In six matches, he scored 128runs and took seven wickets. England won the four-match Test series 3–0; Afridi played two matches, scoring 49runs and took three wickets. It was the last Test cricket Afridi played until 2010.|$|E

2500|$|Cuzzoni's {{arrival in}} the English capital was keenly {{anticipated}} in the press. Though the [...] "London Journal" [...] for 27 October 1722 reported that [...] "Mrs. Cotsona , an extraordinary Italian Lady, ... is expected daily", she apparently found time to marry Pietro Giuseppe Sandoni during her journey, and did not make her debut in London until 12 January 1723, creating the role of Teofane in Handel's Ottone at the King's Theatre, Haymarket. To an aria in her role, [...] "Falsa immagine", there is attached a famous story, vividly illustrating both her character {{and that of the}} composer. The part not having been originally intended for her (but perhaps for Maddalena Salvai), at rehearsal she refused to sing this, her first aria. According to the historian John Mainwaring, Handel replied: [...] "Oh! Madame I know well that you are a real she-devil, but I hereby give you notice, <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> Beelzebub, the Chief of Devils." [...] Mainwaring continued: [...] "With this, he took her up by the waist, and, if she made any more words, swore that he would fling her out of the window." [...] According to Burney, her singing of this aria [...] "fixed her reputation as an expressive and pathetic singer", and her success was such that the price of half-guinea opera tickets reportedly shot up to four guineas. By the time of her benefit concert only two months later, some noblemen were believed to be giving her fifty guineas a ticket. Her salary was also large: £2000 a season. Her appearance was no recommendation: Burney described her as [...] "short and squat, with a doughy cross face, but fine complexion; ... not a good actress; dressed ill and was silly and fantastical." ...|$|E
