However, in 2007, 2008, and 2009 she admitted that she had cut off contact with her father, describing his behavior as unpredictable and hard to deal with.|$|E

He concedes {{he never had}} control of the schools, and his reform efforts were [...] "largely a bust". He focused instead {{on the creation of}} two charter schools, the Oakland School for the Arts and the Oakland Military Institute. Defending his support of a military charter school in Oakland, Brown once told KQED reporter Stephen Talbot, [...] "I believe that had I been sent to the military academy, as <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father</b> threatened, I would have been president a long time ago." ...|$|E

I was completely surprised by his arrest {{and as soon as he}} got home that morning I asked him to tell me truthfully what happened.

2500|$|According to his friends, who {{described}} him as friendly and never violent toward anyone, Purdy was suicidal at times and frustrated that he failed to [...] "make it on his own".

[...] Another one of Purdy's former co-workers stated, [...] "He was always miserable. I've never seen a guy that didn't want to smile {{as much as he}} didn't." [...] In a notebook found in a hotel where he lived in early 1988, Purdy wrote about himself in the following terms: [...] "I'm so dumb, I'm dumber than a sixth-grader. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father</b> were dumb." ...|$|E

His father, from Pennsylvania, was the son of Dutch immigrants, and his mother is originally from North Carolina. He has a sister Nancy and a brother Charles, a classical guitarist. As a youth, Frehley was part of the Ducky Boys street gang. The Frehleys were a musical family, and when Frehley received an electric guitar as a Christmas present in 1964, he immersed himself in learning the instrument. [...] "I never went to music school; I never took a guitar lesson, but everybody in my family plays an instrument. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father</b> both played piano, his father was the church organist, and my brother and sister both played piano and acoustic guitar."

2500|$|In 2008, the American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors {{announced}} that, since {{church members}} had repeatedly violated previous agreements, {{it would no}} longer negotiate with the church to try to prevent vicarious baptism. Speaking on the anniversary of Kristallnacht, Ernest Michel, a Holocaust survivor who reported on the Nuremberg Trials, speaking as the honorary chairman of the American Gathering of Holocaust Survivors, called on the LDS Church to [...] "implement a mechanism to undo what [...] have done", and declared that the LDS Church had repeatedly violated their agreements, and that talks with Mormon leaders were now ended. Jewish groups, he said, would now turn to {{the court of public opinion}} for justice. Michel called the practice a revision of history that plays into the hands of Holocaust deniers, stating: [...] "They tell me, that my parents' Jewishness has not been altered but ... 100 years from now, how will they be able to guarantee that <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father</b> of blessed memory who lived as Jews and were slaughtered by Hitler for no other reason than they were Jews, will someday not be identified as Mormon victims of the Holocaust?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1979, Lee {{accepted}} {{the role of}} Karen Fairgate on Knots Landing, a spin-off of the immensely popular Dallas. Though slow to start, the series eventually became a ratings hit {{and became one of}} the longest-running American primetime dramas ever, lasting for a total of 14 seasons from 1979 - 1993. Due to her long-running tenure, Lee's alter ego is often credited as being the center of the program. Television personality Joan Rivers commented that Lee was, in theory, the [...] "First Lady of Knots Landing" [...] during her guest appearance on The Late Show, which Rivers hosted at the time. The characters of the serial often represented what was happening in society at the time. Lee acknowledged that, saying: [...] "Karen wanted to be a Pollyanna and wasn't ashamed of that. Remember in our society, maybe people don't remember, but remember when we could go over to other people's houses and come in through an open back door? I remember when I was a little girl and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>father</b> would have people over and they'd walk into an unlocked door in our house." [...] Lee was the only performer to appear in all of the show's 344 episodes.|$|E

2500|$|Like a Prayer is {{the fourth}} studio album by American singer Madonna. It was {{released}} on March 21, 1989 by Sire Records, nearly three years after her previous studio effort True Blue.

She described the album as a collection of songs [...] "about <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> <b>and</b> bonds with my family."
