5|$|Somatic effects: <b>myoclonus</b> (muscle twitching), hyperreflexia (manifested by clonus), tremor.|$|E
5|$|Cerebellar atrophy {{has been}} {{observed}} in many other neurological disorders including Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, essential tremor, progressive <b>myoclonus</b> epilepsy, and Niemann–Pick disease. Cerebellar atrophy can also occur {{as a result of}} exposure to toxins including heavy metals or pharmaceutical or recreational drugs.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} stages of {{end-of-life}} care, midazolam is routinely used at low doses via subcutaneous injection to help with agitation, <b>myoclonus,</b> restlessness or anxiety in the last hours or days of life. At higher doses during the last weeks of life, midazolam is considered a first line agent in palliative continuous deep sedation therapy when it is necessary to alleviate intolerable suffering not responsive to other treatments, but the need for this is rare.|$|E
5|$|Movement {{disorders}} {{that may}} develop after TBI include tremor, ataxia (uncoordinated muscle movements), <b>myoclonus</b> (shock-like contractions of muscles), {{and loss of}} movement range and control (in particular {{with a loss of}} movement repertoire). The risk of post-traumatic seizures increases with severity of trauma (image at right) and is particularly elevated with certain types of brain trauma such as cerebral contusions or hematomas. People with early seizures, those occurring within a week of injury, have an increased risk of post-traumatic epilepsy (recurrent seizures occurring more than a week after the initial trauma). People may lose or experience altered vision, hearing, or smell.|$|E
5|$|Management {{is based}} {{primarily}} on stopping the usage of the precipitating drugs, the administration of serotonin antagonists such as cyproheptadine, and supportive care including the control of agitation, the control of autonomic instability, and the control of hyperthermia. Additionally, those who ingest large doses of serotonergic agents may benefit from gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal {{if it can be}} administered within an hour of overdose. The intensity of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms. If the symptoms are mild, treatment may only consist of discontinuation of the offending medication or medications, offering supportive measures, giving benzodiazepines for <b>myoclonus,</b> and waiting for the symptoms to resolve. Moderate cases should have all thermal and cardiorespiratory abnormalities corrected and can benefit from serotonin antagonists. The serotonin antagonist cyproheptadine is the recommended initial therapy, although there have been no controlled trials demonstrating its efficacy for serotonin syndrome. Despite the absence of controlled trials, {{there are a number of}} case reports detailing apparent improvement after people have been administered cyproheptadine. Animal experiments also suggest a benefit from serotonin antagonists. Cyproheptadine is only available as tablets and therefore can only be administered orally or via a nasogastric tube; it is unlikely to be effective in people administered activated charcoal and has limited use in severe cases. Additional pharmacological treatment for severe case includes administering atypical antipsychotic drugs with serotonin antagonist activity such as olanzapine. Critically ill people should receive the above therapies as well as sedation or neuromuscular paralysis. People who have autonomic instability such as low blood pressure require treatment with direct-acting sympathomimetics such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, or phenylephrine. Conversely, hypertension or tachycardia can be treated with short-acting antihypertensive drugs such as nitroprusside or esmolol; longer acting drugs such as propranolol should be avoided as they may lead to hypotension and shock. The cause of serotonin toxicity or accumulation is an important factor in determining the course of treatment. Serotonin is catabolized by monoamine oxidase in the presence of oxygen, so if care is taken to prevent an unsafe spike in body temperature or metabolic acidosis, oxygenation will assist in dispatching the excess serotonin. The same principle applies to alcohol intoxication. In cases of serotonin syndrome caused by monoamine oxidase inhibitors oxygenation will not help to dispatch serotonin. In such instances, hydration is the main concern until the enzyme is regenerated.|$|E
25|$|Spinal <b>myoclonus</b> is <b>myoclonus</b> {{originating}} in the spinal cord, including segmental and propriospinal <b>myoclonus.</b> The latter is usually due to a thoracic generator producing truncal flexion jerk. It is often stimulus-induced with a delay due to the slow conducting propriospinal nerve fibers.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} types of <b>myoclonus</b> include action, {{cortical}} reflex, essential, palatal, those {{seen in the}} progressive <b>myoclonus</b> epilepsies, reticular reflex, sleep and stimulus-sensitive.|$|E
25|$|Action <b>myoclonus</b> is {{characterized}} by muscular jerking triggered or intensified by voluntary movement or even the intention to move. It may be made worse by attempts at precise, coordinated movements. Action <b>myoclonus</b> is the most disabling form of <b>myoclonus</b> and can affect the arms, legs, face, and even the voice. It {{is often associated with}} tonic-clonic seizures and diffuse neuronal disease such as post-hypoxic encephalopathy, uremia, and the various forms of PME, although, in the case of focal cerebral damage, the disease may be restricted to one limb. This type of <b>myoclonus</b> often is caused by brain damage that results from a lack of oxygen and blood flow to the brain when breathing or heartbeat is temporarily stopped. Over-excitement of the sensorimotor cortex (cortical reflex <b>myoclonus)</b> or reticular formation (reticular reflex <b>myoclonus)</b> is also a cause of action <b>myoclonus.</b> Serotonin and GABA neurotransmitters are thought to cause this lack of inhibition, which is a possible explanation as to why improvements are made with the administration of serotonin precursors. Systems involved include the cerebellodentatorubral, pyramidal, extrapyramidal, optic, auditory, posterior columns and gracile and cuneate nuclei, spinocerebellar tracts, motor neurons of cranial nerves and anterior horns, and muscle fibers.|$|E
25|$|Sleep <b>myoclonus</b> {{occurs during}} the initial phases of sleep, {{especially}} {{at the moment of}} dropping off to sleep. Some forms appear to be stimulus-sensitive. Some people with sleep <b>myoclonus</b> are rarely troubled by it, or need treatment. If it is a symptom of a more complex and disturbing sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome, it may require medical treatment. <b>Myoclonus</b> can be associated with patients with Tourette syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Anatomically, <b>myoclonus</b> may {{originate}} from lesions of the cortex, subcortex or spinal cord. The presence of <b>myoclonus</b> above the foramen magnum effectively excludes spinal myoclonus; further localisation relies on further investigation with electromyography (EMG) and electroencephalography (EEG).|$|E
25|$|Some {{researchers}} {{speculate that}} abnormalities or {{deficiencies in the}} receptors for certain neurotransmitters may contribute to some forms of <b>myoclonus.</b> Receptors {{that appear to be}} related to <b>myoclonus</b> include those for two important inhibitory neurotransmitters: serotonin, which constricts blood vessels and brings on sleep, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which helps the brain maintain muscle control. Other receptors with links to <b>myoclonus</b> include those for benzodiazepines, drugs that induce sleep, and for glycine, an inhibitory neurotransmitter that is important for the control of motor and sensory functions in the spinal cord. More {{research is needed to determine}} how these receptor abnormalities cause or contribute to <b>myoclonus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Essential <b>myoclonus</b> {{occurs in}} the absence of {{epilepsy}} or other apparent abnormalities in the brain or nerves. It can occur randomly in people with no family history, or among members of the same family, indicating that it sometimes may be an inherited disorder. Essential <b>myoclonus</b> tends to be stable without increasing in severity over time. Some scientists speculate that some forms of essential <b>myoclonus</b> may be a type of epilepsy with no known cause.|$|E
25|$|<b>Myoclonus</b> {{can occur}} by itself, but most often {{as one of}} several {{symptoms}} associated {{with a variety of}} nervous system disorders, including multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Opsoclonus <b>Myoclonus,</b> Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, Lyme Disease and lupus. Myoclonic jerks commonly occur in persons with epilepsy, a disorder in which the electrical activity in the brain becomes disordered leading to seizures. It is also found in MERRF (Myoclonic Epilepsy with Ragged Red Fibers), a rare mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. <b>Myoclonus</b> can be a coexisting condition with Tourette syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Familiar {{examples}} of normal <b>myoclonus</b> include hiccups and hypnic jerks {{that some people}} experience while drifting off to sleep. Severe cases of pathologic <b>myoclonus</b> can distort movement and severely limit a person's ability to sleep, eat, talk, and walk. Myoclonic jerks commonly occur in individuals with epilepsy.|$|E
25|$|Progressive <b>myoclonus</b> {{epilepsy}} (PME) is a {{group of}} diseases characterized by <b>myoclonus,</b> epileptic seizures, tonic-clonic seizures, and other serious symptoms such as trouble walking or speaking. These rare disorders often get worse over time and sometimes are fatal. Studies have identified at least three forms of PME. Lafora disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that the disease occurs only when a child inherits two copies of a defective gene, one from each parent. Lafora disease is characterized by <b>myoclonus,</b> epileptic seizures, and dementia (progressive loss of memory and other intellectual functions). A second group of PME diseases belonging to the class of cerebral storage diseases usually involves <b>myoclonus,</b> visual problems, dementia, and dystonia (sustained muscle contractions that cause twisting movements or abnormal postures). Another group of PME disorders in the class of system degenerations often is accompanied by action <b>myoclonus,</b> seizures, and problems with balance and walking. Many of these PME diseases begin in childhood or adolescence. Treatment is not normally successful for any extended period of time.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have been}} done with {{electromyography}} to trace skeletal muscle activity in some hyperkinetic disorders. The electromyogram (EMG) of dystonia sometimes shows rapid rhythmic bursts, but these patterns can almost always be produced intentionally. In the <b>myoclonus</b> EMG, there are typically brief, and sometimes rhythmic, bursts or pauses in the recording pattern. When the bursts last for 50 milliseconds or less they are indicative of cortical <b>myoclonus,</b> but when they last up to 200 milliseconds, they are indicative of spinal or brainstem <b>myoclonus.</b> Such bursts can occur in multiple muscles simultaneously quite quickly, but high time resolution must {{be used in the}} EMG trace to clearly record them. The bursts recorded for tremor tend to be longer in duration than those of <b>myoclonus,</b> although some types can last for durations within the range for those of <b>myoclonus.</b> Future studies would have to examine the EMGs for tics, athetosis, stereotypies and chorea as there are minimal recordings done for those movements. However, it may be predicted that the EMG for chorea would include bursts varying in duration, timing, and amplitude, while that for tics and stereotypies would take on patterns of voluntary movements.|$|E
25|$|Most <b>myoclonus</b> {{is caused}} by a {{disturbance}} of the central nervous system. Some are from peripheral nervous system injury. Studies suggest several locations in the brain are involved in <b>myoclonus.</b> One is in the brainstem, close to structures that are responsible for the startle response, an automatic reaction to an unexpected stimulus involving rapid muscle contraction.|$|E
25|$|Benign <b>myoclonus</b> {{can occur}} in healthy {{individuals}} and is most commonly caused by nothing other than arbitrary muscle contractions. <b>Myoclonus</b> may develop in response to infection, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, head or spinal cord injury, stroke, stress, brain tumors, kidney or liver failure, lipid storage disease, chemical or drug poisoning, as {{a side effect of}} certain drugs (such as tramadol, quinolones, benzodiazepine, gabapentin, sertraline, lamotrigine), or other disorders.|$|E
25|$|Surgery is also {{a viable}} option for {{treatment}} if the symptoms are caused by a tumor or lesion in the brain or spinal cord. Surgery may also correct symptoms in those where <b>myoclonus</b> affects parts of the face or ear. While DBS is still being studied for use with <b>myoclonus,</b> Deep Brain Stimulation has also been tried in those with this and other movement disorders.|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} mechanisms underlying <b>myoclonus</b> are not {{yet fully}} understood. Scientists believe that some types of stimulus-sensitive <b>myoclonus</b> may involve overexcitability of {{the parts of the}} brain that control movement. These parts are interconnected in a series of feedback loops called motor pathways. These pathways facilitate and modulate communication between the brain and muscles. Key elements of this communication are chemicals known as neurotransmitters, which carry messages from one nerve cell, or neuron, to another. Neurotransmitters are released by neurons and attach themselves to receptors on parts of neighboring cells. Some neurotransmitters may make the receiving cell more sensitive, while others tend to make the receiving cell less sensitive. Laboratory studies suggest that an imbalance between these chemicals may underlie <b>myoclonus.</b>|$|E
25|$|When {{patients}} are taking multiple medications, the discontinuation of drugs suspected of causing <b>myoclonus</b> {{and treatment of}} metabolic derangements may resolve some cases of <b>myoclonus.</b> When pharmacological treatment is indicated anticonvulsants are the main line of treatment. Paradoxical reactions to treatment are notable. Drugs which most people respond to may in other individuals worsen their symptoms. Sometimes {{this leads to the}} mistake of increasing the dose, rather than decreasing or stopping the drug. Treatment of <b>myoclonus</b> focuses on medications that may help reduce symptoms. Drugs used include sodium valproate, clonazepam, the anticonvulsant levetiracetam, and piracetam. Dosages of clonazepam usually are increased gradually until the patient improves or side effects become harmful. Drowsiness and loss of coordination are common side effects. The beneficial effects of clonazepam may diminish over time if the patient develops a tolerance to the drug.|$|E
25|$|Stimulus-sensitive <b>myoclonus</b> is {{triggered}} {{by a variety of}} external events, including noise, movement, and light. Surprise may increase the sensitivity of the patient.|$|E
25|$|Generalized <b>myoclonus</b> is {{commonly}} seen in comatose people following CPR and {{is seen by}} some {{as an indication of}} catastrophic damage to the neocortex.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the drugs}} used for <b>myoclonus,</b> such as barbiturates, {{phenytoin}} and primidone, are also used to treat epilepsy. Barbiturates slow down {{the central nervous system}} and cause tranquilizing or antiseizure effects. Phenytoin and primidone are effective antiepileptics drugs, although phenytoin can cause liver failure or have other harmful long-term effects in patients with PME. Sodium valproate is an alternative therapy for <b>myoclonus</b> and can be used either alone or in combination with clonazepam. Some people have adverse reactions to clonazepam and/or sodium valproate.|$|E
25|$|Research on <b>myoclonus</b> is {{supported}} through the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). The {{primary focus of}} research is {{on the role of}} neurotransmitters and receptors involved in the disease. Identifying whether or not abnormalities in these pathways cause <b>myoclonus</b> may help in efforts to develop drug treatments and diagnostic tests. Determining the extent that genetics play in these abnormalities may lead to potential treatments for their reversal, potentially correcting the loss of inhibition while enhancing mechanisms in the body that would compensate for their effects.|$|E
25|$|Reticular reflex <b>myoclonus</b> {{is thought}} to be a type of {{generalized}} epilepsy that originates in the brainstem, {{the part of the brain}} that connects to the spinal cord and controls vital functions such as breathing and heartbeat. Myoclonic jerks usually affect the whole body, with muscles on both sides of the body affected simultaneously. In some people, myoclonic jerks occur in only a part of the body, such as the legs, with all the muscles in that part being involved in each jerk. Reticular reflex <b>myoclonus</b> can be triggered by either a voluntary movement or an external stimulus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Myoclonus</b> {{is defined}} as a {{sequence}} of repeated, often nonrhythmic, brief, shock-like jerks due to sudden involuntary contraction or relaxation of one or more muscles. These movements may be asynchronous, in which several muscles contract variably in time, synchronous, in which muscles contract simultaneously, or spreading, in which several muscles contract sequentially. It is characterized by a sudden, unidirectional movement due to muscle contraction, followed by a relaxation period in which the muscle is no longer contracted. However, when this relaxation phase is decreased, as when muscle contractions become faster, a myoclonic tremor results. <b>Myoclonus</b> can often be associated with seizures, delirium, dementia, and other signs of neurological disease and gray matter damage.|$|E
25|$|Objective {{tinnitus}} can {{be detected}} by other people and is sometimes caused by an involuntary twitching of a muscle {{or a group of}} muscles (<b>myoclonus)</b> or by a vascular condition. In some cases, tinnitus is generated by muscle spasms around the middle ear.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} <b>myoclonus</b> in an {{individual}} can {{vary depending on the}} form and the overall health of the individual. In severe cases, particularly those indicating an underlying disorder in the brain or nerves, movement can be extremely distorted and limit ability to normally function, such as in eating, talking, and walking. In these cases, treatment that is usually effective, such as clonazepam and sodium valproate, may instead cause adverse reaction to the drug, including increased tolerance and a greater need for increase in dosage. However, the prognosis for more simple forms of <b>myoclonus</b> in otherwise healthy individuals may be neutral, as the disease may cause few to no difficulties. Other times the disease starts simply, in one region of the body, and then spreads.|$|E
25|$|In {{almost all}} {{instances}} in which <b>myoclonus</b> is caused by central nervous system disease it is preceded by other symptoms; for instance, in CJD it is generally a late-stage clinical feature that appears after the patient has already started to exhibit gross neurological deficits.|$|E
25|$|In {{forms of}} <b>myoclonus</b> where {{only a single}} area is affected, and even in a few other various forms, Botox {{injections}} (OnabotulinumtoxinA) may be helpful. The chemical messenger responsible for triggering the involuntary muscle contractions is blocked by the Botulinum toxins of the Botox.|$|E
25|$|Infrequent adverse {{reactions}} in patients taking opioids for pain relief include: dose-related respiratory depression (especially with more potent opioids), confusion, hallucinations, delirium, urticaria, hypothermia, bradycardia/tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, headache, urinary retention, ureteric or biliary spasm, muscle rigidity, <b>myoclonus</b> (with high doses), and flushing (due to histamine release, except fentanyl and remifentanil).|$|E
25|$|Middle ear <b>myoclonus</b> {{occurs in}} {{the muscles of the}} middle ear. These muscles may include the tensor tympani and stapedius muscles. It can involve the muscles {{surrounding}} the Eustachian tube, which include the tensor veli palatini, levator veli palatini, and salpingopharyngeus. Sufferers describe it as a thumping sound or sensation in the ear.|$|E
25|$|Several {{renal failure}} {{patients}} developed <b>myoclonus</b> while receiving pregabalin, apparently {{as a result}} of gradual accumulation of the drug. Acute overdosage may be manifested by somnolence, tachycardia and hypertonicity. Plasma, serum or blood concentrations of pregabalin may be measured to monitor therapy or to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients.|$|E
25|$|If this proves {{ineffective}} or if barbiturates {{cannot be}} used for some reason, then a general anesthetic such as propofol may be tried; sometimes it is used second after the failure of lorazepam. This also means putting the people on artificial ventilation. Propofol {{has been shown to}} be effective in suppressing the jerks seen in <b>myoclonus</b> status epilepticus.|$|E
25|$|Concerning {{more serious}} afflictions, the complex origins of <b>myoclonus</b> may {{be treated with}} {{multiple}} drugs, which have a limited effect individually, but greater when combined with others that act on different brain pathways or mechanisms. Treatment is most effective when the underlying cause is known, and can be treated as such. Some drugs being studied in different combinations include clonazepam, sodium valproate, piracetam, and primidone. Hormonal therapy may improve responses to antimyoclonic drugs in some people.|$|E
