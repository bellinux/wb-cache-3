Because the surface may interact with the subsurface ocean (considering the geological discussion above), this <b>molecular</b> <b>oxygen</b> may make its way to the ocean, where it could aid in biological processes. One estimate suggests that, given the turnover rate inferred from the apparent ~0.5 Gyr maximum age of Europa's surface ice, subduction of radiolytically generated oxidizing species might well lead to oceanic free oxygen concentrations that are comparable to those in terrestrial deep oceans.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{evidence}} of the oxygen atmosphere comes from spectral detection of gases trapped in the ice at the surface of Ganymede. The detection of ozone (O3) bands was announced in 1996. In 1997 spectroscopic analysis revealed the dimer (or diatomic) absorption features of <b>molecular</b> <b>oxygen.</b> Such an absorption can arise only if the oxygen is in a dense phase. The best candidate is <b>molecular</b> <b>oxygen</b> trapped in ice. The depth of the dimer absorption bands depends on latitude and longitude, rather than on surface albedo—they tend to decrease with increasing latitude on Ganymede, whereas O3 shows an opposite trend. Laboratory work has found that O2 would not cluster or bubble but dissolve in ice at Ganymede's relatively warm surface temperature of 100 K (−173.15°C).|$|E
40|$|By {{studying}} spectrochemically the decomposition {{processes of}} carohemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, and carboxyemoglobin {{in the presence}} of 1 -ascorbic acid and <b>molecular</b> <b>oxygens</b> the author obtained the following results. 1. In the case of carbohemoglobin besides tha already-known absorption peaks of 556 mμ and 430 mμ it shows another absoorption peak at 760 mμ, and its EmM is 1. 4 - 2. 0. 2. The absorption curve of the 670 mμ and 630 mμ substances at the time of deoxydation by sodium dithionite and causatic soda show the absorption peak at 618 mμ and 760 mμ. 3. The decomposition of caroxyhemoglobin takes similar decomposition processes as taken by oxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin, producing the 670 mμ and 630 mμ substances. In other words, it seems that caroxyhemoglobin is reduced to hemoglobin by liberating carbon monoxide and then it enters into decomposition processes, and its decomposition is extremely slow as compared with that of oxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin. 4. CO-choleglobin is not an intermediate product of carboxyhemoglobin decomposition but it is produced at the time when choleglobin comes in contact with carbon monoxide. 5. CO-choleglobin is split into carbon monoxide and choleglobin {{in the presence of}} 1 -ascorbic acid and <b>molecular</b> <b>oxygens...</b>|$|R

Callisto is thought to have formed by slow accretion from the disk of the gas and dust that surrounded Jupiter after its formation. Callisto's gradual accretion and the lack of tidal heating meant that not enough heat was available for rapid differentiation. The slow convection in the interior of Callisto, which commenced soon after formation, led to partial differentiation and possibly to the formation of a subsurface ocean at a depth of 100150km and a small, rocky core.|$|E

Iron is also the metal at the active site of many important redox enzymes dealing with cellular respiration and oxidation and reduction in plants and animals.

This iron is distributed throughout the body in hemoglobin, tissues, muscles, bone marrow, blood proteins, enzymes, ferritin, hemosiderin, and transport in plasma.|$|E
3000|$|Based on the results, we can {{conclude}} that under no high bias or high bias condition, the <b>oxygen</b> <b>molecular</b> always acts as a key role to decrease the current. In air condition, the higher current caused by high bias can increase the concentration of carriers and enlarge the conduction channel along the nanowires, and the more electrons can easily cross the depletion layer near the surface of nanowire and combine with <b>oxygen</b> <b>molecular,</b> which reduces the electrical conductance of WO 3 nanowire. So, a [...] "sudden" [...] dropping current can be found when switching to a low bias as shown in Figure 4 c. Opposite, there is an absence of <b>oxygen</b> <b>molecular</b> in vacuum condition as the recombination centers to decrease the current as shown in Figure 4 d. Thus, a mechanism, combination of high bias and oxygen adsorption at the surface of WO 3 nanowire, can perfectly explain the phenomenon.|$|R
30|$|In summary, we have {{observed}} a giant PPC phenomenon of WO 3 nanowire in vacuum condition. No decreasing current {{can be observed}} in absence of <b>oxygen</b> <b>molecular</b> atmosphere, and a gradually decay current can be presented in air condition. For the SiO 2 -surrounded WO 3 nanowire, there is a very weak photoresponse in our measurements. The high bias and high electric field effects can accelerate the decay process in air, but not in vacuum condition. We can conclude that: (1) the photoconductivity of WO 3 nanowire is mainly related to the oxygen adsorption and desorption, and the typical semiconductor photoconductivity properties of WO 3 nanowire are very weak comparing to the surface effect; (2) the giant PPC effect is caused by the absence <b>oxygen</b> <b>molecular</b> as recombination center in vacuum condition, and the intensity of PPC is only depended on the <b>oxygen</b> <b>molecular</b> re-adsorbed rate on the surface of WO 3 nanowires; (3) the thermal effect and oxygen re-adsorption can accelerate the decay current.|$|R

He sent a telegram on December 22, 1877 to the French Academy of Sciences in Paris announcing his discovery of liquid oxygen.

5|$|Chemical {{reactions}} led to {{the first}} self-replicating molecules about four billion years ago. A half billion years later, the last common ancestor of all life arose. The evolution of photosynthesis allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms. The resultant <b>molecular</b> <b>oxygen</b> (O2) accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation, formed a protective ozone layer (O3) in the upper atmosphere. The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted {{in the development of}} complex cells called eukaryotes. True multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized. Aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer, life colonized Earth's surface. Among the earliest fossil evidence for life is microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone in Western Australia, biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks in Western Greenland, remains of biotic material found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.|$|E

The detection of organic molecules, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, in significant quantities in comets has led to speculation that comets or meteorites may have brought the precursors of life—or even life itself—to Earth. In 2013 it was suggested that impacts between rocky and icy surfaces, such as comets, had the potential to create the amino acids that make up proteins through shock synthesis.

Paradoxically, hypoxia also provides an attractive therapeutic target as it only occurs in solid tumors; hypoxia-activated radiosensitizers may be designed and synthesized with therapeutic selectivity on tumor cells. Directed by our previous femotomedicine (FMD) mechanistic research, our group has recently discovered a FMD compound that can react with pre-solvated electron (epre) to increase the radiosensitivity in tumor tissues but relatively spare normal tissues. In this thesis work, the in vitro selective radiosensitivity of the FMD compound against hypoxic cancer cells was evaluated through the steady-state absorption spectrum analysis, the immunofluorescence assay, and the clonogenic assay. The results demonstrated that the FMD compound is an effective radiosensitizer in the hypoxic environment (radio enhancement ratio = 1. 42 ± 0. 05), and the potency of the radiosensitizing effect of the FMD compound in the oxic (normal) environment will be limited due to the competing attachments of pre-solvated electrons with the FMD molecules and <b>molecular</b> <b>oxygens.</b> The revealing of the underlying mechanism of the FMD compound’s radiosensitizing effect provides new insight into the design of novel hypoxia-activated radiosensitizers...|$|R
