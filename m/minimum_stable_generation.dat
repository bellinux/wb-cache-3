40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the rationale for development of significantly enhanced transmission capacity on a continent scale, in this case in Europe. With a particular emphasis on the accommodation of wind power in the North Sea, it describes an assessment {{of the extent to which}} lack of transmission capacity at a European level will act as a constraint to realising Europe-wide targets for electricity from renewable sources in 2020. A plausible generation and demand scenario has been postulated and inter-area power flows studied in a number of network cases for the whole of Europe. The network cases are intended to provide insights into the drivers for different levels of transmission expansion and the different network configurations by which increased transfer capability might be delivered offshore. The analytical methods used take account of realistic time series of available generation including wind and hydro, model spatial correlations of wind and hydro power, <b>minimum</b> <b>stable</b> <b>generation</b> and on and off times, and regionally differentiated reserve requirements. Most particularly, by means of Monte Carlo simulation, the variability of power deficits and surpluses at different locations and flows between locations can be assessed. The analysis is achieved through use of the ANTARES tool developed by RTE. The main metrics used to compare the different scenarios are annual energy production from different types of generator, emissions of carbon dioxide, the total energy from renewables, and the volume of ‘spilled’ wind energy. The results suggest that new offshore network capacity to allow increased exchange of power between different countries will be important to realising the full potential of new wind power developments. This new network capacity not only allows local surpluses of wind power to be used elsewhere but also facilitates reserve power to be held remote from a particular area and so minimise the total holding of reserve and increase the utilisation of renewable energy. However, it has two further effects: depending on the exact location, it can permit onshore network constraints to be bypassed and, as is shown, it can allow cheap high carbon generation in remote areas to be used instead of lower carbon fossil fuelled plant in a local area. It may thus be concluded that not only are support for investment in very low carbon generation capacity such as wind and development of the transmission network important for reduction of carbon emissions associated with use of electricity, but so too is effective pricing of carbon emissions...|$|E

Figure 6 depicts the advancing and receding contact angles. The advancing contact angle is the maximum stable angle, whereas the receding contact angle is the <b>minimum</b> <b>stable</b> angle. Contact-angle hysteresis occurs because many different thermodynamically stable contact angles are found on a nonideal solid.

40|$|Properties of a mechano-electrical {{transduction}} channel {{were studied}} in enzymatically dissociated chick vestibular hair cells {{by using a}} whole-cell recording variation of the patch voltage-clamp technique. The apical hair bundle was stimulated by a glass rod which moved along a one-dimensional axis when stimulated by either a triangular or a trapezoidal command voltage. The motion of the glass rod was monitored optically using a photodiode. In response to triangular stimuli, the hair cell generated a current of triangular wave form with occasional step-like spiky or zigzag-appearing events. Control experiments confirmed that the current was generated only when the hair bundle was displaced towards the tallest stereocilium. The mechano-sensitive current was blocked by streptomycin and by neomycin. The blockage by streptomycin was clearly voltage dependent: {{the reduction of the}} current became larger with hyperpolarization of the membrane. This suggests that the positively charged antibiotic molecules plug the mechanically gated channels. From the evidence presented in 3 and 4 above, the mechano-sensitive current recorded here was identified as the mechano-electrical transduction (m-e. t.) current. The permeability of the m-e. t. channel to various monovalent cations was determined from reversal potential measurements. Since a CsCl-EGTA intracellular medium was used, all the permeabilities were calculated relative to PCs. The sequence of permeabilities was Li greater than Na {{greater than or equal to}} K greater than or equal to Rb greater than Cs greater than choline greater than TMA greater than TEA. External Ca ions were indispensable for the recording of transduction current and Sr ions could replace Ca ions without loss of the transduction activity. The <b>minimum</b> [Ca]o for <b>stable</b> <b>generation</b> of the m-e. t. current was 20 microM in Cs saline. The addition of 50 - 200 microM-Ca to the isotonic Ba saline could maintain the m-e. t. current. The m-e. t. current was observed in isotonic Ca and in Sr salines. Isotonic Ba, Mg and Mn salines were enriched with 1 - 2 mM-Ca in order to generate the m-e. t. current. The permeabilities of the divalent cations relative to Cs were calculated from the reversal potentials, and the sequence of permeabilities among divalent cations was Ca greater than Sr greater than Ba greater than Mn greater than Mg. Step-like m-e. t. currents were observed in Cs saline. The smallest step amplitude with clear resolution had a conductance of 49. 7 +/- 4. 5 pS (mean +/- S. D., n = 7 cells). This is likely to be an elementary m-e. t. channel conductance. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|R

Because of increased sophistication and severity of these attacks, the system administrator of a victim site needs to quickly and accurately identify the probable attackers and eliminate the attack traffic. Our work {{is based on a}} probabilistic marking algorithm in which an attack graph can be constructed by a victim site. We extend the basic concept such that one can quickly and efficiently deduce the intensity of the "local traffic" generated at each router in the attack graph based on the volume of received marked packets at the victim site. Given the intensities of these local traffic rates, we can rank the local traffic and identify the network domains generating most of the attack traffic. We present our traceback and attacker identification algorithms.
