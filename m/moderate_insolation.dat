However there exist very few scientifically sound studies, which apply due diligence to substantiating this impression. In the present paper, the case of photovoltaic power sources in regions of <b>moderate</b> <b>insolation</b> is analysed critically by using the concept of Energy Return on Energy Invested (ERoEI, also called EROI). But the methodology for calculating the ERoEI differs greatly from author-to-author. The main differences between solar PV Systems are between the current ERoEI and what is called the extended ERoEI (ERoEI EXT). The current methodology recommended by the International Energy Agency is not strictly applicable for comparing photovoltaic (PV) power generation with other systems. The main reasons are {{due to the fact that}} on one hand, solar electricity is very material-intensive, labour-intensive and capital-intensive and on the other hand the solar radiation exhibits a rather low power density...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1967 Seven {{sites of}} uniform {{topography}} and soil were selected within a self perpetuating ponderosa pine forest {{found on the}} eastern flank of the central Oregon Cascades. These plots were located along a vegetational gradient caused mainly by an orographic rain shadow. Data gathered included density, frequency, and cover for all understory species, amount of direct overhead tree cover, and amount of shade cast by the tree canopy. An {{attempt was made to}} relate the distributional pattern of understory species to influences caused by shade, overhead tree cover, and shrub cover within each pIot. The Dfd index and Cole's index were statistical methods used to correlate the herbaceous species pattern to overhead tree cover, shrub cover, and shade. Of the two, Cole's index appeared to be a more sensitive tool for this study. All the shrub species with the exception of Purshia tridentata showed a consistent distributional pattern to insolation. The position along the vegetational gradient appeared to be related with the shrub's affinity for an insolation class. Those shrubs restricted to the mesic end of the gradient showed an affinity for Iow insolation or deep shade. Conversely, those shrubs occurring on the xeric end showed an affinity for higher insolation. Those shrubs found {{in the center of the}} gradient showed an affinity for <b>moderate</b> <b>insolation.</b> Ten herbaceous species out of a total of 16 observed showed apparent affinities for a certain microhabitat within the stand. Plot location, shade, overhead vertical crown cover, and shrub cover influenced the distribution of herbaceous species within the plot. Species found within mesic plots showed a weak affinity for cover, but those on xeric plots showed a strong affinity for cover. A weak indication of the spatial ecological niche was gained for 15 herbaceous species, but a strong indication was observed for Trientalis latifolia. Similarly, some insight into the ecological performance of the species was gained in regard to insolation. Usually the plot location coincided with the species' affinity for an insolation class. If the species occurred mainly on the mesic end of the gradient, it showed an affinity, for deep shade (Lupinus caudatus, Fragaria virginiana, Trientalis latifolia, and Pteridium aquilinum). If the species occurred mainly on the xeric end of the gradient, it showed an affinity for high insolation (Viola purpurea, Carex inops, and Madia minirna). Five species showed some affinity for <b>moderate</b> <b>insolation</b> (Clarkia rhornboidea, Eriogonurn urnbellaturn, Kelloggia galioides, Mimulus nanus, and Stipa occidentalis), but the correlation with plot location was less clear. Four species (Festuca idahoensis, Sitanion hvstrix, Achillea rnillefoliurn, and Lathvrus lanswertii) were not restricted to any part of the gradient. These species showed preference to insolation with the plot, but this preference was not usually the same throughout the gradient. Indications of the limits of ecological potential were found for some of these species, in particular Achillea millefolium which did not occur on any plot where insolation was less than 10...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth and}} {{reduction}} of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets {{over the past}} million years is dominated by an approximately 100, 000 -year periodicity and a sawtooth pattern (gradual growth and fast termination). Milankovitch theory proposes that summer insolation at high northern latitudes drives the glacial cycles, and statistical tests have demonstrated that the glacial cycles are indeed linked to eccentricity, obliquity and precession cycles. Yet insolation alone cannot explain the strong 100, 000 -year cycle, suggesting that internal climatic feedbacks may also be at work. Earlier conceptual models, for example, showed that glacial terminations {{are associated with the}} build-up of Northern Hemisphere ‘excess ice’, but the physical mechanisms underpinning the 100, 000 -year cycle remain unclear. Here we show, using comprehensive climate and ice-sheet models, that insolation and internal feedbacks between the climate, the ice sheets and the lithosphere–asthenosphere system explain the 100, 000 -year periodicity. The responses of equilibrium states of ice sheets to summer insolation show hysteresis, with the shape and position of the hysteresis loop playing a key part in determining the periodicities of glacial cycles. The hysteresis loop of the North American ice sheet is such that after inception of the ice sheet, its mass balance remains mostly positive through several precession cycles, whose amplitudes decrease towards an eccentricity minimum. The larger the ice sheet grows and extends towards lower latitudes, the smaller is the insolation required to make the mass balance negative. Therefore, once a large ice sheet is established, a <b>moderate</b> increase in <b>insolation</b> is sufficient to trigger a negative mass balance, leading to an almost complete retreat of the ice sheet within several thousand years. This fast retreat is governed mainly by rapid ablation due to the lowered surface elevation resulting from delayed isostatic rebound, which is the lithosphere–asthenosphere response. Carbon dioxide is involved, but is not determinative, {{in the evolution of the}} 100, 000 -year glacial cycles...|$|R
40|$|The late Ordovician was {{a period}} of major climatic and {{biological}} change, much of which is poorly understood. Global cooling began in the Caradoc (early Katian) with the build-up of ice in southern polar regions of the palaeocontinent of Gondwana. Cooling continued into the Ashgill (late Katian) but may have been interrupted by a brief period of global warming, the Boda Event, in the Cautleyan-Rawtheyan immediately prior to the Hirnantian glacial maximum. The proceeding Hirnantian Stage of the Upper Ordovician {{was a period}} of abrupt global change in the biosphere, climate and ocean geochemistry. These events are marked by: (1) an abrupt positive Hirnantian isotopie carbon excursion (HICE); (2) one of the three global Phanerozoic mass extinctions and (3) an extensive drop in sealevel associated with the maximum extent of the Gondwanan ice sheet. Biostratigraphic correlation for the Late Ordovician between basin and shelf sections in the Welsh Basin is limited. The current study describes three new chitinozoan taxa, Spinachitina penbryniensis, Belonechitina reticulatus and Belonechitina ceredigionensis and developed a chitinozan biostratigraphic scheme for the Welsh Basin. Four of the six Avalonian Ashgill chitinozoan biozones are recognized: the bergstroemi fossensis, umbilicata and taugourdeaui Biozones. The Baltoscandian and Laurentian index taxon Hercochitina gamachiana is recorded {{for the first time in}} Avalonia and a new lower Hirnantian regional biozone, the new Belonechitina reticulatus n. sp. Biozone is erected. The Cautleyan-Rawtheyan (late Katian) rugata Biozone was not recorded. Four depth-facies biotopes for chitinozoa from the upper Katian-Hirnantian (Upper Ordovician) of Avalonia have been identified herein. These are: 1) an open ocean shallow-water epipelagic biotope which includes Cyathochitina campanulaeformis; 2) an open ocean middle-depth mesopelagic biotope comprising Hercochitina and Spinachitina; 3) an open ocean deep-water meso-bathypelagic biotope characterized by Bursachitina umbilicata and 4) a shelf biotope containing predominantly Desmochitina. The taxonomic composition of the open ocean middle- depth mesopelagic biotope changes from one dominated by Hercochitina and Spinachitina in the Upper Katian to one comprising Ancyrochitina in the Hirnantian post-glacial transgression. The distribution of the deep-water meso- bathypelagic biotope and the shelf biotope is affected by basin hydrography and sea level respectively. Changing hydrography induced by climate belt reconfiguration along the southern margin of lapetus in the Rawthean (late Katian), displaced deep-water taxa into the semi-restricted Welsh Basin. With sea level fall in the early Hirnantian, taxa from the shelf biotope expanded into the shallower basin. Origination of biostratigraphically useful taxa in such segregated environments, e. g. Bursachitina umbilicata, restricts their distribution to periods of climatic and environmental change. Gradual change in climate and, hence, distribution of important biozone taxa, leads to diachroneity of chitinozoan bio-zones. During the Katian and Hirnantian, the Welsh Basin, UK, lay on the northern margin of the palaeocontinent of Avalonia at mid-latitudes (estimated between 32 - 45 s), within the boundaries of the present-day position of the STHP. It therefore provides a suitable environment to test for sensitivity of palaeo-climate belt movement in a mid-palaeolatitude setting (Armstrong et al, in revision). When the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and Sub-Tropical high pressure belt (STHP) were in a southerly position, mid-palaeolatitudes, which includes the Welsh Basin, were positioned beneath south-easterly trade winds. This climate belt configuration is recorded in the Welsh Basin by the deposition of organic-rich laminated hemipelagites deposited during wind-driven coastal up-welling. Coastal upwelling, increased productivity and organic carbon burial are recorded by increased Ba/Th, increased TOC wt% and negative δ(^ 13) C. Negative δ (^ 13) C excursions are interpreted to represent remobilization of (^ 12) C֊enriched waters during upwelling from the deep-ocean. The onset of the expression of climate belt movement during Boda Event times is later in the Welsh Basin than at low-palaeolatitudes. At low-palaeolatitudes the δ(^ 18) Ο response to shifting ITCZ occurred in the Cautleyan whilst in the Welsh Basin the isotopic and lithological response to moving STHP began in the Rawtheyan. This delay in expression of events is accounted for by ice-sheet- <b>moderated</b> rectification of <b>insolation</b> in the run-up to the glacial maximum. The onset of the Hirnantian glacial maximum is orbitally-moderated and is interpreted to represent an orbital configuration when eccentricity wag high, obliquity low and aphelion occurred during Austral summer. It represents a threshold at which the Gondwanan ice-sheet was able to survive precession and obliquity-induced ablation. Once this threshold had been reached, global climate belt position stabilized in a position where the ITCZ lay north of the equator and the STHP lay north of Avalonia. Four positive δ (^ 13) Corp excursions in Hirnantian-age rocks from the Welsh Basin have been recognized in this study and are considered to represent the HICE. They correlate well between basin and shelf environments and also with a proposed sequence stratigraphic model for the Hirnantian in the Welsh Basin. Two excursions of up to 3 %(_ 00) occur in the lower Hirnantian reticulatus chitinozoan Bio- zone and two excursions of 1 %(_ 00) are present in the late Hirnantian taugourdeaui Biozone. Higher carbon storage in the basin, coincident with positive δ (^ 13) Corp excursions during glacial periods, indicate a shift in the locus of carbon burial from the shelf to the basin during low sealevel. The topology of the regional Hirnantian isotope curve for the Welsh Basin compares with only a few curves from other parts of the world indicating strong regional carbon cycling. Comparison of the relative timing of the onset of HICE and peak HICE values from other palaeocontinents demonstrate little, if any, consistency with palaeolatitude or basin setting. It is demonstrated that this chemostratigraphic diachroneity of HICE can be attributed to the process of signal rectification of δ (^ 13) Corp records most likely due to numerous local carbon cycling processes...|$|R
