There, he encounters several characters, one of whom reveals the danger facing the four Crystals that control the world's elements. These Crystals act as a seal on Exdeath, an evil sorcerer. Bartz and his party <b>must</b> <b>keep</b> the Crystals from being exploited by Exdeath's influence and prevent his resurgence.|$|E

5|$|In {{the sixth}} century, Caesarius of Arles taught {{that the whole}} glory of the Jewish Sabbath had been {{transferred}} to Sunday and that Christians <b>must</b> <b>keep</b> Sunday {{in the same way}} as the Jews were commanded to keep the Sabbath. The Council of Orléans in 538 reprobated this tendency, to apply the law of the Jewish Sabbath to the observance of the Christian Sunday, as Jewish and non-Christian.|$|E
5|$|SimTower {{allows the}} player {{to build and}} manage the {{operations}} of a modern, multi-use skyscraper. They must plan where to place facilities in the tower that include restaurants, condominiums, offices, hotel rooms, retail stores and elevators. To prevent tenants from vacating their properties, the player <b>must</b> <b>keep</b> their stress low by fulfilling their demands for medical centers, parking lots, recycling facilities, clean hotel rooms {{with the help of}} housekeepers, and an efficient transportation system, which involves managing elevator traffic. SimTower, which was built around an elevator simulation program, places a strong emphasis on good elevator management.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{tells the}} arrival of Merlin (Colin Morgan) {{as a young man}} in Camelot, where magic is banned by King Uther Pendragon (Anthony Head). Taken under the wing of Camelot's physician, Gaius (Richard Wilson), he is warned that he <b>must</b> <b>keep</b> his innate magical ability a secret. In Camelot, he meets Uther's heir, the arrogant Prince Arthur (Bradley James), as well as Lady Morgana (Katie McGrath) and her handmaid, Guinevere (Angel Coulby). As a witch (Eve Myles) plans revenge on the King's heir for the {{execution}} of her son, Merlin is informed by a cryptic dragon (John Hurt) that his destiny is to protect Arthur.|$|E
5|$|A player {{capturing}} a piece immediately passes {{that piece}} to the capturing player's partner. The partner keeps these pieces in reserve and may, instead of playing a regular move, place {{one of these}} pieces on the board (as in shogi and crazyhouse), called dropping the piece. Pieces in reserve or on deck may be dropped on any vacant square, including squares where the piece delivers check or checkmate; however, pawns may not be dropped on the first or last rank. Dropped pawns may promote, but all promoted pawns convert back to pawns when captured. In play over the board, a promoted pawn can be put on its side to indicate promotion. A pawn placed on the second rank may move two squares on its first move. Each player <b>must</b> <b>keep</b> the reserve or stock pieces {{on the table in}} front of the board, always visible to all players of the game.|$|E
5|$|Opponents of the FairTax {{argue that}} {{imposing}} a national retail sales tax would drive transactions underground {{and create a}} vast underground economy. Under a retail sales tax system, the purchase of intermediate goods and services that are factors of production are not taxed, since those goods would produce a final retail good that would be taxed. Individuals and businesses {{may be able to}} manipulate the tax system by claiming that purchases are for intermediate goods, when in fact they are final purchases that should be taxed. Proponents point out that a business is required to have a registered seller's certificate on file, and <b>must</b> <b>keep</b> complete records of all transactions for six years. Businesses must also record all taxable goods bought for seven years. They are required to report these sales every month (see Personal vs. business purchases). The government could also stipulate that all retail sellers provide buyers with a written receipt, regardless of transaction type (cash, credit, etc.), which would create a paper trail for evasion with risk of having the buyer turn them in (the FairTax authorizes a reward for reporting tax cheats).|$|E

25|$|Keeping Miley's secret {{involves}} a two sided effort. As Hannah, she <b>must</b> <b>keep</b> her fans unaware {{that she is}} really a normal kid, and as Miley, she <b>must</b> <b>keep</b> her friends unaware that she is really Hannah Montana. In interviews, Miley Cyrus spoke of the implausibility {{of being able to}} keep a secret such as Miley and her family do in the show in a world of intense media scrutiny. The show however, remains workable primarily based on suspension of disbelief.|$|E

25|$|Registered {{number plate}} {{suppliers}} <b>must</b> <b>keep</b> records including the documents produced by their customers; {{they can be}} required to be shown to the police, although in reality this has seldom happened. The Department for Transport holds a full list of suppliers.|$|E
25|$|The {{simulation}} <b>must</b> <b>keep</b> {{track of}} position, velocity, acceleration and previous acceleration vectors per particle (though some clever work-arounds for storing the previous acceleration vector are possible), keeping its memory requirements {{on par with}} velocity Verlet and slightly {{more expensive than the}} original Verlet method.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} code inserts a node {{after an}} existing node in a singly linked list. The diagram shows how it works. Inserting a node before an existing one cannot be done directly; instead, one <b>must</b> <b>keep</b> {{track of the}} previous node and insert a node after it.|$|E

The {{decisions}} of the House—not the words spoken during debates—are recorded in the Journal; if one-fifth of those present (assuming a quorum is present) request it, the votes of the members on a particular question must also be entered.|$|E
25|$|As in any {{infrastructure}} asset, railways <b>must</b> <b>keep</b> up with periodic {{inspection and}} maintenance {{in order to minimize}} effect of infrastructure failures that can disrupt freight revenue operations and passenger services. Because passengers are considered the most crucial cargo and usually operate at higher speeds, steeper grades, and higher capacity/frequency, their lines are especially important. Inspection practices include track geometry cars or walking inspection. Curve maintenance especially for transit services includes gauging, fastener tightening, and rail replacement.|$|E
25|$|It {{takes about}} 400 years for ice to {{traverse}} {{the length of}} the glacier, meaning that the ice {{at the foot of the}} glacier is about 400 years old. The glacier routinely calves off icebergs the size of a ten-story building. Where the glacier meets the bay, most of the ice is below the waterline, and newly calved icebergs can shoot up quite dramatically, so that ships <b>must</b> <b>keep</b> their distance from the edge of the glacier in Disenchantment Bay.|$|E
