[...] She added, [...] "all they've done is punish a few leaders, but they haven't done anything to the people directly responsible for dragging <b>my</b> <b>sister-in-law</b> [...] in to have an abortion. They haven't pursued a single person for criminal liability." [...] Jicai also noted that no mention was made of the people who later harassed the family, nor was there any mention of an incident where her brother was attacked and beaten.|$|E
500|$|Since its broadcast, [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's" [...] {{garnered}} {{little to}} no scrutiny from viewers. Vitti has never gotten any questions about the episode, except from his sister-in-law who wanted him to explain the episode for his nephews. [...] " [...] <b>My</b> <b>sister-in-law</b> called me up saying that I {{needed to talk to}} my nephews about how this was wrong that Homer did", Vitti said. [...] "They watched it and had lots of questions for her. And she referred them all to me. So {{there are some people who}} are still bothered by it." [...] The little amount of scrutiny that the episode attracted took The Simpsons staff by surprise, as they anticipated that the episode would generate a lot of controversy. Instead, [...] "Blame It on Lisa", an episode which aired the previous week, caused an uproar in Brazil because of its depiction of the country. It became one of the biggest controversies the series has ever faced. [...] "It just goes to show that you never know what's going to be a problem", Jean said in the DVD commentary for [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's".|$|E

6000|$|... 'Just like them,' said Albinia. 'Is {{that the}} reason you wish me {{to make the most}} of the connexion? Let me see, <b>my</b> <b>sister-in-law's</b> sister's wife--no, husband's brother's uncle, eh?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are three}} cousins," [...] said Spindler, {{checking}} them {{off on his}} fingers, [...] "a half-uncle, a kind of brother-in-law,--that is, the brother of <b>my</b> <b>sister-in-law's</b> second husband,--and a niece. That's six." ...|$|R
6000|$|SHE. Indeed {{you have}} no right to wish {{anything}} of the sort. They are quite unfit for anybody but a married woman. That's just the difficulty. What will <b>my</b> <b>sisters-in-law</b> think of them? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Good-morning, ma'am,' said Ralph, {{shutting}} the door abruptly after him to prevent any further conversation. 'Now for <b>my</b> <b>sister-in-law.</b> Bah!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This," [...] he continued, [...] "is {{one of our}} {{informal}} days. There is no one in {{the house}} save <b>my</b> <b>sister-in-law,</b> niece, and nephew, and a poor invalid gentleman who, I am sorry to say, is confined to his bed. <b>My</b> <b>sister-in-law</b> is also, I regret to say, indisposed. She desired me to present her excuses to you and say how greatly she is looking forward to making your acquaintance during the next few days." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will bring}} Clive," [...] says Colonel Newcome, rather {{disturbed}} at this reception. [...] "After his illness <b>my</b> <b>sister-in-law</b> was {{very kind to}} him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Astonishing! Where did I last see her? At the Windygates station, to be sure--going to London, {{after she}} had left <b>my</b> <b>sister-in-law's</b> service. Has she {{accepted}} another place--without letting me know first, as I told her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I had {{a letter}} from one of <b>my</b> <b>sisters-in-law,</b> Charlotte," [...] said Mr. Barrett. [...] "A most {{affecting}} letter. Poor Charlotte was like a second mother to them. She’ll {{never be the same}} woman again. Never!" ...|$|R
50|$|Nga Aung Zwa Nge, I made thee {{a promise}} indeed but if I were to give thee one of <b>my</b> <b>sisters-in-law,</b> {{it would be}} held a sin against my grand-sires and great-grand-sires. I will make thee great, and give thee a {{daughter}} of a great nobleman.|$|R
6000|$|... "As to {{the latter}} you may do as you please. And now, {{touching}} <b>my</b> <b>sister-in-law,</b> I will simply recommend you to look after your own affairs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't see how," [...] Barnes {{declared}} sullenly. [...] "If {{this young}} lady is <b>my</b> <b>sister-in-law,</b> surely she and I can settle up our own affairs." ...|$|E
60|$|THE LADY [continuing]. Oh, it {{was quite}} easy. I said I was <b>my</b> <b>sister-in-law</b> and that I was a Hun. He lapped it up like a kitten....|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{sad story}} of <b>my</b> <b>sister-in-law's</b> life," [...] he said, [...] "will, I think, explain certain things {{which must have}} {{naturally}} perplexed you. My brother was introduced {{to her at the}} house of an Australian gentleman, on a visit to England. She was then employed as governess to his daughters. So sincere was the regard felt for her by the family that the parents had, at the entreaty of their children, asked her to accompany them when they returned to the Colony. The governess thankfully accepted the proposal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am come," [...] he said gravely, {{holding out}} his {{stronger}} hand to his little brother and sister, who sprang to him, [...] "to bring <b>my</b> father-and <b>sister-in-law,</b> Major and Miss Delavie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can start}} from this house," [...] pursued Sir Patrick; [...] "or {{you can start}} from a shooting-cottage {{which is on the}} Windygates property--among the woods, {{on the other side of}} the moor. The weather looks pretty well settled (for Scotland), and there are plenty of horses in the stables. It is useless to conceal from you, gentlemen, that events have taken a certain {{unexpected}} turn in <b>my</b> <b>sister-in-law's</b> family circle. You will be equally Lady Lundie's guests, whether you choose the cottage or the house. For the next twenty-four hours (let us say)--which shall it be?" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>sister-in-law</b> came {{in later}} on in the evening (she is a {{thoughtful}} girl), and brought a box with her {{about the size of a}} tea-chest. She said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, of course. I {{shall be}} very much {{surprised}} if the earl does not come now. And I must consult <b>my</b> <b>sister-in-law</b> as to asking the Duke of Omnium." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{think it}} {{necessary}} to protest, but you are quite ready to believe me. You have received an impression of <b>my</b> <b>sister-in-law,</b> you have guessed of what she is capable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I feel I owe you an apology, but it's <b>my</b> <b>sister-in-law's</b> one weakness, and {{you have}} won her favor {{for the rest of}} your natural life," [...] Savine returned. [...] "You have had several {{distinguished}} fellow-sufferers, including provincial representatives and railroad directors, for to my horror she physicked a very famous one the last time he came. He did not suffer with your equanimity. In fact, he was almost uncivil, and said to me, 'If the secretary hadn't sent off your trestle contract, I should urge the board to reconsider it. Did you ask me here that your relatives might poison me, Savine?'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly. You do {{not seem}} to find them very {{engaging}} company, but they can scarce be worse than I should find in such an asylum as <b>my</b> charming <b>sister-in-law</b> seems to have in preparation for me." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{cried out}} at this, and demanded whether <b>my</b> little <b>sister-in-law</b> could {{possibly}} be thus described. He owned that she was incredibly improved, and begged my pardon and hers, {{saying that he was}} only repeating what Aubepine either believed or pretended to believe her to be.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I mean my wife," [...] said Mr. Westgate. [...] "I don't suppose <b>my</b> <b>sister-in-law</b> knows {{much about}} them. She has always led {{a very quiet}} life; she has lived in Boston." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly so. I {{have been}} {{explaining}} to my cousin all about it. I hope the firm {{will be able}} to pay <b>my</b> <b>sister-in-law</b> the interest on it, but that does not seem sure." ...|$|E
60|$|With this speech, {{and with}} the {{children}} and their maid sobbing before her, my lady retired; but for once <b>my</b> <b>sister-in-law</b> was on my side, not liking the meddlement of the elder lady.|$|E
5000|$|... "Five years ago, <b>my</b> Afghan <b>sister-in-law</b> {{emigrated to}} the United States, where she now works, pays taxes and takes part in public life. If she had turned up in Europe, she would still be {{undergoing}} treatment from social workers for her trauma—and she still wouldn't have got a job or won acceptance as a citizen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} sounds strange," [...] {{continued}} the widow, [...] "but I {{know that people}} can see down into clear water, and the water under me was clear, and the crack was wide {{enough for me to}} see through, and down under me was sharks and swordfishes and other horrible water creatures, which I had never seen before, all driven into the bay, I haven't a doubt, by the violence of the storm out at sea. The thought of my bein' upset and fallin' in among those monsters made my very blood run cold, and involuntary-like I began to turn the handle of the rudder, and in a moment I shot into a wall of ragin' sea-water that was towerin' around me. For a second I was fairly blinded and stunned, but I had the cork out of that oil-can in no time, and very soon--you'd scarcely believe it if I told you how soon--I had another placid mill-pond surroundin' of me. I sat there a-pantin' and fannin' with my straw hat, for you'd better believe I was flustered, and then I began to think {{how long it would take}} me to make a line of mill-ponds clean across the head of the bay, and how much oil it would need, and whether I had enough. So I sat and calculated that if a tumblerful of oil would make a smooth place about seven yards across, which I should say was the width of the one I was in,--which I calculated by a measure of my eye as to how many breadths of carpet it would take to cover it,--and if the bay was two miles across betwixt our house and <b>my</b> <b>sister-in-law's,</b> and, although I couldn't get the thing down to exact figures, I saw pretty soon that I wouldn't have oil enough to make a level cuttin' through all those mountainous billows, and besides, even if I had enough to take me across, what would be the good of goin' if there wasn't any oil left to fill <b>my</b> <b>sister-in-law's</b> lamp? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She was {{literally}} {{alone in the}} world, sir. When I tell you {{that she had been}} brought up in the Foundling Hospital, you will understand what I mean. Oh, there is no romance in <b>my</b> <b>sister-in-law's</b> story! She never has known, or will know, who her parents were or why they deserted her. The happiest moment in her life was the moment when she and my brother first met. It was an instance, on both sides, of love at first sight. Though not a rich man, my brother had earned a sufficient income in mercantile pursuits. His character spoke for itself. In a word, he altered all the poor girl's prospects, as we then hoped and believed, for the better. Her employers deferred their return to Australia, so that she might be married from their house. After a happy life of a few weeks only--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall go with you," [...] Lord Langerdale {{suddenly}} declared. [...] "Alice was <b>my</b> <b>sister-in-law,</b> and if Ravenor deserted or ill-used her, I {{have the}} right to call him to account for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What does it signify?" [...] said Eustace. [...] "The wretched {{stones are}} gone for ever; {{and whether they}} were of right the {{property}} of <b>my</b> <b>sister-in-law,</b> or of her son, cannot matter now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just so, Mr Rubb. That is what I think; and {{therefore}} I have given <b>my</b> <b>sister-in-law</b> no hint {{that there is}} a chance left. I think you had better not do so either." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{this stage}} of the narrative, which I heard many times (by request) from the lips of Captain Nicholas B.'s <b>sister-in-law,</b> <b>my</b> grandmother, I used to tremble with excitement.|$|R
60|$|Whenever <b>my</b> pretty <b>sister-in-law</b> {{talks in}} this way I always try to forget that she came of a family far {{inferior}} to our own, the Razorbills. Indeed, her people--of the Nonconformist stock--really had nothing but wealth and rectitude, and I think my brother Bob, in his genuine love for her, was willing to overlook the latter {{for the sake of}} the former.|$|R
6000|$|... "Believe {{her to be}} <b>my</b> affectionate <b>sister-in-law!</b> I won't {{believe her}} to be {{anything}} of the kind," [...] Margaret so spoke of the writer to herself, when she had finished the letter; but, nevertheless, she answered it with kind language, saying {{that she could not}} stay in town as she passed through to the Cedars, but that she would pass one night in Gower Street when she called to pick up Susanna on her return home.|$|R
