5|$|Nearly all <b>mammals</b> are {{endothermic}} ("warm-blooded"). Most <b>mammals</b> {{also have}} hair {{to help keep}} them warm. Like birds, <b>mammals</b> can forage or hunt in weather and climates too cold for ectothermic ("cold-blooded") reptiles and insects. Endothermy requires plenty of food energy, so <b>mammals</b> eat more food per unit of body weight than most reptiles. Small insectivorous <b>mammals</b> eat prodigious amounts for their size. A rare exception, the naked mole-rat produces little metabolic heat, so it is considered an operational poikilotherm. Birds are also endothermic, so endothermy {{is not unique to}} <b>mammals.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some <b>mammals</b> are intelligent, {{with some}} {{possessing}} large brains, self-awareness and tool use. <b>Mammals</b> can communicate and vocalize {{in several different}} ways, including the production of ultrasound, scent-marking, alarm signals, singing, and echolocation. <b>Mammals</b> can organize themselves into fission-fusion societies, harems, and hierarchies, but can also be solitary and territorial. Most <b>mammals</b> are polygynous, but some can be monogamous or polyandrous.|$|E

5|$|Contaminants {{that are}} {{discharged}} into {{the marine environment}} accumulate in the bodies of marine <b>mammals</b> when they are stored unintentionally in their blubber along with energy. Contaminants that {{are found in the}} tissues of marine <b>mammals</b> include heavy metals, such as mercury and lead, but also organochlorides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. For example, these can cause disruptive effects on endocrine systems; impair the reproductive system, and lower the immune system of individuals, leading to a higher number of deaths. Other pollutants such as oil, plastic debris and sewage threaten the livelihood of marine <b>mammals.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the Mesozoic, the prototypical mammal {{was a small}} nocturnal {{insectivore}} {{something like}} a tree shrew.

5|$|In human culture, domesticated <b>mammals</b> {{played a}} major role in the Neolithic revolution, causing farming to replace hunting and gathering, and leading to a major {{restructuring}} of human societies with the first civilizations. They provided, and continue to provide, power for transport and agriculture, as well as various commodities such as meat, dairy products, wool, and leather. <b>Mammals</b> are hunted or raced for sport, and are used as model organisms in science. <b>Mammals</b> have been depicted in art since Palaeolithic times, and appear in literature, film, mythology, and religion. Defaunation of <b>mammals</b> is primarily driven by anthropogenic factors, such as poaching and habitat destruction, though there are efforts to combat this.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mammals</b> are {{a diverse}} class of animals, mostly {{terrestrial}} {{but some are}} aquatic and others have evolved flapping or gliding flight. They mostly have four limbs but some aquatic <b>mammals</b> have no limbs or limbs modified into fins and the forelimbs of bats are modified into wings. The legs of most <b>mammals</b> are situated below the trunk, which is held well clear of the ground. The bones of <b>mammals</b> are well ossified and their teeth, which are usually differentiated, are coated in a layer of prismatic enamel. The teeth are shed once (milk teeth) during the animal's lifetime or not at all, {{as is the case}} in cetaceans. <b>Mammals</b> have three bones in the middle ear and a cochlea in the inner ear. They are clothed in hair and their skin contains glands which secrete sweat. Some of these glands are specialized as mammary glands, producing milk to feed the young. <b>Mammals</b> breathe with lungs and have a muscular diaphragm separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs. The mammalian heart has four chambers and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely separate. Nitrogenous waste is excreted primarily as urea.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mammals</b> {{are rarely}} {{consumed}} by river otters, {{and are not}} a major dietary component. <b>Mammals</b> preyed upon by otters are characteristically small or are a type species found in riparian zones.

5|$|<b>Mammals</b> {{include the}} biggest animals on the planet, the great whales. The basic body type is a {{terrestrial}} quadruped, but some <b>mammals</b> are adapted for life at sea, in the air, in trees, underground or on two legs. The {{largest group of}} <b>mammals,</b> the placentals, have a placenta, which enables the feeding of the fetus during gestation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mammals</b> signal by {{a variety}} of means. Many give visual anti-predator signals, as when deer and gazelle stot, {{honestly}} indicating their fit condition and their ability to escape, or when white-tailed deer and other prey <b>mammals</b> flag with conspicuous tail markings when alarmed, informing the predator that it has been detected. Many <b>mammals</b> make use of scent-marking, sometimes possibly to help defend territory, but probably with a range of functions both within and between species. Microbats and toothed whales including oceanic dolphins vocalize both socially and in echolocation.|$|E
5|$|Marine <b>mammals</b> have {{a number}} of {{physiological}} and anatomical features to overcome the unique challenges associated with aquatic living. Some of these features are very species specific. Marine <b>mammals</b> have developed a number of features for efficient locomotion such as torpedo shaped bodies to reduce drag; modified limbs for propulsion and steering; tail flukes and dorsal fins for propulsion and balance. Marine <b>mammals</b> are adept at thermoregulation using dense fur or blubber, circulatory adjustments (counter-current heat exchangers); torpedo shaped bodies, reduced appendages, and large size to prevent heat loss.|$|E

5|$|Marine <b>mammals</b> {{were first}} hunted by {{aboriginal}} peoples {{for food and}} other resources. Many were also the target for commercial industry, leading to {{a sharp decline in}} all populations of exploited species, such as whales and seals. Commercial hunting lead to the extinction of †Steller's sea cow and the †Caribbean monk seal. After commercial hunting ended, some species, such as the gray whale and northern elephant seal, have rebounded in numbers; conversely, other species, such as the North Atlantic right whale, are critically endangered. Other than hunting, marine <b>mammals</b> can be killed as bycatch from fisheries, where they become entangled in fixed netting and drown or starve. Increased ocean traffic causes collisions between fast ocean vessels and large marine <b>mammals.</b> Habitat degradation also threatens marine <b>mammals</b> and their ability to find and catch food. Noise pollution, for example, may adversely affect echolocating <b>mammals,</b> and the ongoing effects of global warming degrade arctic environments.|$|E
5|$|Most vertebrates—the amphibians, the {{reptiles}} {{and some}} <b>mammals</b> such as humans and bears—are plantigrade, {{walking on the}} whole of the underside of the foot. Many <b>mammals,</b> such as cats and dogs, are digitigrade, walking on their toes, the greater stride length allowing more speed. Digitigrade <b>mammals</b> are also often adept at quiet movement. Some animals such as horses are unguligrade, walking on the tips of their toes. This even further increases their stride length and thus their speed. A few <b>mammals,</b> namely the great apes, are also known to walk on their knuckles, at least for their front legs. Giant anteaters and platypuses are also knuckle-walkers. Some <b>mammals</b> are bipeds, using only two limbs for locomotion, which can be seen in, for example, humans and the great apes. Bipedal species have a larger field of vision than quadrupeds, conserve more energy and have the ability to manipulate objects with their hands, which aids in foraging. Instead of walking, some bipeds hop, such as kangaroos and kangaroo rats.|$|E
5|$|Non-human <b>mammals</b> play a {{wide variety}} of roles in human culture. They are the most popular of pets, with tens of {{millions}} of dogs, cats and other animals including rabbits and mice kept by families around the world. <b>Mammals</b> such as mammoths, horses and deer are among the earliest subjects of art, being found in Upper Paleolithic cave paintings such as at Lascaux. Major artists such as Albrecht Dürer, George Stubbs and Edwin Landseer are known for their portraits of <b>mammals.</b> Many species of <b>mammals</b> have been hunted for sport and for food; deer and wild boar are especially popular as game animals. <b>Mammals</b> such as horses and dogs are widely raced for sport, often combined with betting on the outcome. There is a tension between the role of animals as companions to humans, and their existence as individuals with rights of their own. <b>Mammals</b> further play {{a wide variety}} of roles in literature, film, mythology, and religion.|$|E

5|$|Several {{invertebrate}} {{systems are}} considered acceptable alternatives to vertebrates in early-stage discovery screens. Because of {{similarities between the}} innate immune system of insects and <b>mammals,</b> insects can replace <b>mammals</b> in some types of studies. Drosophila melanogaster and the Galleria mellonella waxworm have been particularly important for analysis of virulence traits of mammalian pathogens. Waxworms and other insects have also proven valuable for the identification of pharmaceutical compounds with favorable bioavailability. The decision to adopt such models generally involves accepting a lower degree of biological similarity with <b>mammals</b> for significant gains in experimental throughput.|$|E
5|$|Several other <b>mammals</b> {{have been}} {{recorded}} from the late Cretaceous of Madagascar, mostly {{on the basis of}} isolated teeth.

A lower molar, UA8699, may be of a marsupial or a placental and a molar fragment is referable to Multituberculata. Finally, an as-yet-undescribed mammal is known from a fairly complete skeleton. None of these <b>mammals</b> is related to the living <b>mammals</b> of the island, many of which belong to unique groups (see List of <b>mammals</b> of Madagascar).
