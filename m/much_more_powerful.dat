5|$|Technical {{development}} continued rapidly {{through the}} dreadnought era, with steep changes in armament, armor and propulsion. Ten years after Dreadnoughts commissioning, <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> ships, the super-dreadnoughts, were being built.|$|E
5|$|Ecuador {{is still}} at risk from earthquakes: Both intraplate (such as those in March 1987) and {{interplate}} earthquakes are possible. Intraplate seismicity poses a more formidable threat, {{as it can be}} <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> than interplate seismicity and is usually associated with landslides, subsidence, and even soil liquefaction.|$|E
5|$|The Magdeburg class {{introduced}} several {{significant improvements}} over earlier designs, including {{a more effective}} bow shape that improved seakeeping and a cut-down quarterdeck that allowed for more efficient handling of the ships' mines. Perhaps most importantly, a waterline armored belt was added to improve the defensive capabilities of the new ships. They also had <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> turbines, and as a result, a higher top speed. All following light cruisers adopted these innovations.|$|E
50|$|T5 High Output {{fluorescent}} bulbs {{which are}} thinner than traditional T8 bulbs {{and provide a}} <b>much</b> brighter, <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> light are commonly used as are the older VHO (Very High Output) fluorescent tubes and compact fluorescent lighting.|$|R

5|$|Truman's second inauguration was {{the first}} ever {{televised}} nationally. His second term was grueling as his opponents controlled Congress and his policy of rollback in Korea failed. The Soviet Union's atomic bomb project progressed much faster than had been expected and they detonated their first bomb on August 29, 1949. In response, on January 7, 1953, Truman announced the detonation of the first U.S. hydrogen bomb, which was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> than the Soviets' atomic weapons.|$|E
5|$|While other bats {{have almost}} {{lost the ability}} to {{maneuver}} on land, vampire bats can walk, jump, and even run by using a unique, bounding gait, in which the forelimbs instead of the hindlimbs are recruited for force production, as the wings are <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> than the legs. This ability to run seems to have evolved independently within the bat lineage.|$|E
5|$|All the bound {{protons and}} {{neutrons}} in an atom {{make up a}} tiny atomic nucleus, and are collectively called nucleons. The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to 1.07fm, where A is {{the total number of}} nucleons. This is much smaller than the radius of the atom, which is on the order of 105fm. The nucleons are bound together by a short-ranged attractive potential called the residual strong force. At distances smaller than 2.5 fm this force is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> than the electrostatic force that causes positively charged protons to repel each other.|$|E
40|$|We review recent {{experiments}} in evolutionary robotics {{carried out in}} dynamic environments and across different robotic platforms. We then introduce a new evolutionary approach where robots are evolved {{for their ability to}} adapt online. Several experiments show that this new approach is <b>much</b> faster, <b>more</b> <b>powerful,</b> and scalable that the traditional approach...|$|R
5000|$|In the Cold War, the Soviet Union had {{to compete}} with <b>much</b> <b>more</b> {{economically}} <b>powerful</b> and resource-rich western countries. This required efficient use of available resources. In 1975, Soviet mathematician and economist Leonid Kantorovich won a Nobel Prize in Economics {{for his work on}} the optimal allocation of scarce resources.|$|R
50|$|A mobile armour {{is usually}} non-humanoid, {{and is usually}} <b>much</b> larger and <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> than {{contemporary}} mobile suits. The MA-08 Big Zam exemplifies the typical traits of a mobile armour.|$|R
5|$|In the Late Classic, {{alliance}} with Calakmul was frequently {{associated with the}} promise of military support. The fact that Copán, a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> city than Quiriguá, failed to retaliate against its former vassal implies that it feared the military intervention of Calakmul. Calakmul itself was far enough away from Quiriguá that K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat was not afraid of falling directly under its power as a full vassal state, even though it is likely that Calakmul sent warriors to help in the defeat of Copán. The alliance instead seems to have been one of mutual advantage: Calakmul managed to weaken a powerful ally of Tikal while Quiriguá gained its independence.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, one {{improvement}} to Zeus {{was already}} being studied: a new phased-array radar replacing Zeus' mechanical ones would greatly {{increase the number}} of targets and interceptors that a single site could handle. <b>Much</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> computers were needed to match this performance. Additionally, the antennas were mounted directly in concrete and would have increased blast resistance. Initial studies at Bell Labs started in 1960 on what was then known as the Zeus Multi-function Array Radar, or ZMAR. In June 1961, Western Electric and Sylvania were selected to build a prototype, with Sperry Rand Univac providing the control computer.|$|E
5|$|Production of the Dornier {{ended in}} mid-1940, {{in favour of}} the newer and more {{powerful}} Junkers Ju 88. The successor of the Do 17 was the <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> Dornier Do 217, which started to appear in strength in 1942. Even so, the Do 17 continued service in the Luftwaffe in various roles {{until the end of}} the war, as a glider tug, research and trainer aircraft. A considerable number of surviving examples were sent to other Axis nations as well as countries like Finland. Few Dornier Do 17s survived the war and the last was scrapped in Finland in 1952.|$|E

50|$|Minako Aino is a 13-year-old young {{middle school}} {{student who is}} {{slightly}} distracted, out-spoken and dreams about someday finding her true love and boyfriend. One day, she encounters a talking white cat with a crescent moon on its forehead named Artemis. He reveals that Minako possesses the magical ability to transform into a <b>much</b> stronger, <b>more</b> <b>powerful,</b> and <b>more</b> beautiful girl than anyone.|$|R
50|$|The top-end Rover 90 {{appeared}} with a <b>much</b> larger <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> 2.6 L six {{at the same}} time, 24 September 1953 as the four-cylinder Rover 60 was introduced. Rover's idiosyncratic central gear change lever designed to allow three-abreast seating in front was used for this new car. This engine produced 90 hp (67 kW) and could propel the car to reach 90 mph (145 km/h).|$|R
5|$|From then on, {{relations}} {{became increasingly}} strained between Matilda and Henry. The couple suspected that they lacked genuine support in England for {{their claim to}} the throne, and proposed in 1135 that the King should hand over the royal castles in Normandy to Matilda and should insist that the Norman nobility immediately swear allegiance to her. This {{would have given the}} couple a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> position after Henry's death, but the King angrily refused, probably out of a concern that Geoffrey would try to seize power in Normandy while he was still alive. A fresh rebellion broke out in southern Normandy, and Geoffrey and Matilda intervened militarily on behalf of the rebels.|$|E
5|$|In December 1996, former classmate Tuomas Holopainen invited Turunen to {{join his}} new {{acoustic}} mood music project, and she immediately agreed. At the recording session for the first demo Holopainen discovered that due to her classical singing lessons, Turunen's voice had become <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> than he recalled from their school days. At the following band practices, Emppu Vuorinen used an electric guitar instead of an acoustic guitar because he felt that it gave a better accompaniment to her voice. Holopainen later explained that the band members had gradually realised that Turunen's voice had become too dramatic for acoustic mood music and eventually {{came to the conclusion}} that the music had to be massive too. Hence Holopainen decided to form Nightwish as a metal band.|$|E

50|$|The Chevrolet Series C Classic Six is {{the first}} {{automobile}} produced by American car manufacturer Chevrolet. It {{is one of the}} few Chevrolets made while record-setting Buick race car driver Louis Chevrolet was with the company. This Brass Era Chevy was <b>much</b> larger, <b>more</b> <b>powerful,</b> <b>more</b> stylized and therefore more expensive than the cars that would ultimately replace it. Louis Chevrolet loved it, but William Durant had a cheaper car in mind.|$|R
50|$|Both {{the regular}} XT and the XT6 were {{discontinued}} after 1991 and {{were replaced by}} the much larger Subaru Alcyone SVX. The SVX continued the tradition of surprising gadgetry in a sporty coupe, albeit in a <b>much</b> heavier and <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> package.|$|R

The disaster for Copán had long-lasting consequences; major construction ceased and no new monuments were raised for the next 17years.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 6 December, the German ships departed Picton Island, bound for the Falklands. On 7 December, they rounded Tierra del Fuego and turned north into the Atlantic. They arrived off the Falklands at around 02:00; three hours later, von Spee detached Gneisenau and Nürnberg to land a party ashore. By 08:30, the ships were approaching Port Stanley, when they noticed thick columns of smoke rising from the harbor. After closing to the harbor entrance, they quickly realized they were confronted by a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> squadron, which was just getting up steam. Von Spee immediately broke off the operation and turned east to flee before the British ships could catch his squadron. By 10:45, Gneisenau and Nürnberg had rejoined the fleet, and the German auxiliaries were detached to seek shelter in the maze of islands off Cape Horn.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{attempted}} {{to build up}} a base of political support for Matilda in both England and Normandy, demanding that his court take oaths first in 1127, and then again in 1128 and 1131, to recognise Matilda as his immediate successor and recognise her descendants as the rightful rulers after her. Stephen was amongst those who took this oath in 1127. Nonetheless, relations between Henry, Matilda, and Geoffrey became increasingly strained {{towards the end of the}} King's life. Matilda and Geoffrey suspected that they lacked genuine support in England, and proposed to Henry in 1135 that the King should hand over the royal castles in Normandy to Matilda whilst he was still alive and insist on the Norman nobility swearing immediate allegiance to her, thereby giving the couple a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> position after Henry's death. Henry angrily declined to do so, probably out of a concern that Geoffrey would try to seize power in Normandy somewhat earlier than intended. A fresh rebellion broke out in southern Normandy, and Geoffrey and Matilda intervened militarily on behalf of the rebels. In the middle of this confrontation, Henry unexpectedly fell ill and died near Lyons-la-Forêt.|$|E
50|$|The {{main feature}} of Bloody Roar 3 {{is the ability}} to {{transform}} into beasts, which is involved in all of the Bloody Roar games. Once the character transforms, they regain all the health they have lost and become <b>much</b> stronger and <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> than before.|$|R

5|$|There {{can be no}} more {{complaints}} of inactivity of the government. The forward march movement into Virginia, indicated in my despatches last night, {{took place at the}} precise time this morning that I named, but in <b>much</b> <b>more</b> imposing and <b>powerful</b> numbers.|$|R
5|$|In principle, {{an atomic}} {{structure}} could be determined from applying X-ray scattering to non-crystalline samples, {{even to a}} single molecule. However, crystals offer a much stronger signal due to their periodicity. A crystalline sample is by definition periodic; a crystal is composed of many unit cells repeated indefinitely in three independent directions. Such periodic systems have a Fourier transform that is concentrated at periodically repeating points in reciprocal space known as Bragg peaks; the Bragg peaks correspond to the reflection spots observed in the diffraction image. Since the amplitude at these reflections grows linearly with the number N of scatterers, the observed intensity of these spots should grow quadratically, like N2. In other words, using a crystal concentrates the weak scattering of the individual unit cells into a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful,</b> coherent reflection that can be observed above the noise. This {{is an example of}} constructive interference.|$|E
5|$|Populous: The Beginning {{takes place}} before {{the first two games}} in the series. The player {{controls}} the Blue tribe, pitted against the three enemy tribes which control most of the solar system. The player's destiny as Shaman is to become a deity; only by defeating all the enemies in the system can the player's shaman become omnipotent. The player begins on the planet furthest from the sun, and attacks each planet in sequence. Along the way, the Shaman can learn new skills and magic to defeat her (usually) <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> enemies. Victory requires the player to either destroy the opposition, or on occasion perform special actions. The player loses if his or her Shaman is killed and there are no remaining followers, if the Shaman is killed and there is no circle of reincarnation, or the player runs out of time on timed levels. Upon beating back the other tribes, the Shaman ascends to godhood, and further helps her people conquer the Matak, Chumara and Dakini in one final conflict.|$|E
5|$|The Lavochkin La-150 (also {{known as}} the Izdeliye 150 – Aircraft or Article 150, USAF/DOD {{designation}} Type 3), was designed by the Lavochkin design bureau (OKB) {{in response to a}} 1945 order to build a single-seat jet fighter using a single German turbojet. By this time both the Americans and British, as well as the Germans, had already flown jet fighters and the single Soviet jet engine under development (the Lyulka TR-1) was not yet ready for production. The design was completed quickly, but the construction of the five flying prototypes was protracted by the factory's inexperience in building metal aircraft. The aircraft made its first flight in September 1946, but proved to require extensive modifications to meet the Soviet Air Forces' requirements. These took so long to make and test that the aircraft was essentially obsolete by the time that they were completed. Even one variant with a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>powerful</b> engine was inferior to other aircraft that the OKB had under development and all work was terminated in 1947.|$|E
