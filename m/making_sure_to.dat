He had initially applied for the vacant job at Bournemouth, but Bournemouth were unable to find the £6,000 Leeds demanded, and the Leeds directors decided to instead appoint Revie as manager. At the time the club was in debt and was located in a rugby league territory, with very little football tradition. Less than 7,000 turned out for the final home game of the 1960–61 season whilst Leeds's championship game of the 1960–61 Rugby League season had an attendance of over 50,000.

He showed trust in his players, leaving them mainly to their own devices though he always made sure he was fully informed as to what they were up to off the pitch, even {{going so far as to}} tell them to dump their girlfriends if he viewed them as unsuitable. He also introduced lengthy dossiers on opposing teams to ensure his players knew every detail about the opposition and were able to exploit weaknesses and nullify threats. Other changes were based on some of his many superstitions, such as his belief that birds were bad luck which resulted in him getting rid of the owl on the club badge and the discontinuation of the Peacocks nickname in favour of the Whites.|$|E

The building rivalry was immediately expressed by both competitors working a more aggressive style of match than they usually do, including repeated attempts by Último Guerrero to unmask his opponent, which in Lucha Libre is the ultimate dirty trick to use. Atlantis won the first fall of the match, causing Último Guerrero to retaliate, not just by trying to pull Atlantis' mask off, but by actually tearing it apart in places. Guerrero managed to win the second fall as he used the ropes for illegal leverage during the pin-fall, <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> <b>to</b> hide it from the referee. The third fall was the longest of the match and saw Atlantis retaliate by starting to tear Último Guerrero's mask apart too, using some of the same rudo tricks as his opponent.

After the match Atlantis made a public challenge to Guerrero and his tag team partner Dragón Rojo, Jr. to defend the CMLL World Tag Team Championship against Atlantis and a partner of his choice, but Guerrero did not respond to the challenge.|$|E
