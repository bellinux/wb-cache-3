5|$|In {{completely}} arbitrary fashion Collet {{chose the}} names of six composers, Auric, Durey, Honegger, Poulenc, Tailleferre and <b>myself,</b> <b>for</b> {{no other reason than}} that we knew each other, that we were friends and were represented in the same programmes, but without the slightest concern for our different attitudes and our different natures. Auric and Poulenc followed the ideas of Cocteau, Honegger was a product of German Romanticism and my leanings were towards a Mediterranean lyrical art... Collet's article made such a wide impression that the Groupe des Six had come into being.|$|E

25|$|Count Benedetti {{spoke to}} me on the promenade, in order to demand from me, finally in a very importunate manner, that I should authorize him to {{telegraph}} at once that I bound <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> all future time never again to give my consent if the Hohenzollerns should renew their candidature. I refused at last somewhat sternly, as it is neither right nor possible to undertake engagements of this kind à tout jamais. Naturally I told him that I had as yet received no news, and as he was earlier informed about Paris and Madrid than myself, he could clearly see that my government once more had no hand in the matter. His Majesty has since received a letter from the Prince. His Majesty having told Count Benedetti that he was awaiting news from the Prince, has decided with reference to the above demand, upon the representation of Count Eulenburg and myself, not to receive Count Benedetti again, but only to let him be informed through an aide-de-camp that his Majesty had now received from the Prince confirmation of the news which Benedetti had already received from Paris, and had nothing further to say to the ambassador. His Majesty leaves it to your Excellency whether Benedetti's fresh demand and its rejection should not be at once communicated both to our ambassadors and to the press.|$|E

500|$|The Daily Telegraphs Robbie Collin {{gave the}} film three (out of five) stars. He {{appreciated}} {{the use of}} stunts and special effects over computerized effects, stating that it [...] "gives proceedings a flame-grilled authenticity". Collin added, [...] "I was thoroughly appalled, mainly at <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> enjoying it." [...] Empires Nick de Semlyen was more critical, labeling it a [...] "huge, bulging disappointment". Semlyen criticized the plot and what he judged an overuse of references, set pieces and dialogue from the cast's filmography without creating memorable moments of its own. Semlyen praised Van Damme's [...] "grandstanding, plutonium-crazed baddie" [...] and Lundgren's [...] "action-troll" [...] as high points. The Village Voices Nick Pinkerton found the violence creative, but said that the film was negatively impacted by self-referencing, [...] "joyless one-line nods" [...] and [...] "outright cash-in cynicism" [...] (referring to cameo appearances {{by some of the}} actors).|$|E
500|$|Wollstonecraft {{was forced}} to write the Rights of Woman hurriedly to respond to Talleyrand and ongoing events.

I intend to finish the next volume before I begin to print, for it is not pleasant to have the Devil coming for the conclusion of a sheet fore it is written." [...] When Wollstonecraft revised the Rights of Woman for the second edition, she took the opportunity not only to fix small spelling and grammar mistakes but also to bolster the feminist claims of her argument. She changed some of her statements regarding female and male difference to reflect a greater equality between the sexes.|$|E
500|$|Following Olivier's {{success in}} Shakespearean stage productions, {{he made his}} first foray into Shakespeare on film in 1936, as Orlando in As You Like It, {{directed}} by Paul Czinner, [...] "a charming if lightweight production", according to Michael Brooke of the British Film Institute's (BFI's) Screenonline. The following year Olivier appeared alongside Vivien Leigh in the historical drama Fire Over England. He had first met Leigh briefly at the Savoy Grill and then again when she visited him during the run of Romeo and Juliet, probably early in 1936, and the two had begun an affair sometime that year. Of the relationship, Olivier later said that [...] "I couldn't help myself with Vivien. No man could. I hated <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> cheating on Jill, but then I had cheated before, but this was something different. This wasn't just out of lust. This was love that I really didn't ask for but was drawn into." [...] While his relationship with Leigh continued he conducted an affair with the actress Ann Todd, and possibly had a brief affair with the actor Henry Ainley, according to the biographer Michael Munn.|$|E

There {{was no need to}} worry about a backing track or a bum note, a pleasant realization at a pop show." [...] Herald Suns Cameron Adams opined that One Direction have [...] "strong pop voices". Melody Lau of the National Post wrote, [...] "It's easy to get lost in inherent appeal of their perfectly coiffed dos and almost-too-put-together preppy style but somewhere {{in the midst of all}} the love-struck squeals of teenage girls are guys who can actually sing and, to a certain extent, entertain." [...] Jane Stevenson of the portal site Canoe concurred: [...] "What I didn't really prepare <b>myself</b> <b>for</b> was that they all can actually sing in concert." [...] Chris Richards, writing in The Washington Post, dissented from the approval: [...] "As the five traded couplets, it was tough to imagine a future Justin Timberlake, Ricky Martin or Bobby Brown emerging from the pack. No one voice stood out." [...] Mike Wass of Idolator felt One Direction's [...] "surprisingly accomplished effort" [...] of Kings of Leon's [...] "Use Somebody" [...] proved that One Direction are [...] "more than capable" [...] of evolving their sound.|$|E
500|$|Bede's {{account of}} the {{conversion}} is oft-cited. After Paulinus explains the tenets of Christianity, the king asks his counselors {{what they think of}} the new doctrine. Edwin's priest Coifi responds that they may be worthwhile; after all, he says, no one has been more respectful of and devoted to their gods than he, and he has seen no benefits from his dedication to them. Then, an unnamed counselor stands up and addresses the king, also seeing the benefit of the new faith. Coifi speaks again and announces that they should destroy the idols and temples they had hitherto worshiped. King Edwin agrees and embraces Christianity; Coifi himself will set fire to the idols. declaring [...] "I will do this <b>myself,</b> <b>for</b> now that the true God has granted me knowledge, who more suitably than I can set a public example, and destroy the idols that I worshipped in ignorance?” Bede goes on to describe the scene as Cofi [...] "formally renounces his superstitions, and asked the king to give him arms and a stallion." [...] Armed with both a sword and spear, Cofi rides Edwin’s horse towards the idols, all within view of the crowd gathered to witness Edwin’s conversion. Upon reaching the temple, Cofi [...] "cast a spear into it and profaned it." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{reception}} {{ranged from}} positive to mixed. Critic Maureen Ryan was very {{positive about the}} episode in her blog at The Chicago Tribune, writing, [...] "I liked this week's episode, and for once, it wasn't a case of really wanting to like it {{and trying to find}} reasons to see past various flaws. I just enjoyed the hour and felt it had just the right mixture of creepiness and character development (plus, the Observer was awesome. If only they'd called him the Watcher, but let's not quibble)." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger found [...] "The Arrival" [...] a noticeable improvement over previous episodes. [...] "...After being more than prepared to give [...] "Fringe That's It For Me! status going into the episode, I enjoyed the strangeness of it—The Observer's hairlessness and diet, Capt. Patterson from [...] "Generation Kill" [...] toting around a futuristic-looking ray gun and a retro-looking mind-reading machine, Walter casually injecting whatsername with a sedative—that I think I'll be sticking around for a bit...
