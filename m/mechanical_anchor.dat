40|$|The {{outstanding}} {{mechanical properties}} of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers (CFRP), {{such as high}} strength-to-weight ratio, high modulus of elasticity, high corrosion resistance and durability have made them suitable for strengthening applications. High capacity of CFRP laminates may not be completely used due to weakness of the adhesive joint used to bond the laminate to the structure. To use CFRP laminates more efficiently, prestressing might {{be applied to the}} laminate before bonding. Although prestressing has several advantages and improves the structural behavior of the strengthened member, a major problem with this strengthening scheme is the very high interfacial stresses which are built {{up at the end of}} the laminate. One way to deal with the problem is to clamp the laminate using <b>mechanical</b> <b>anchors</b> which often are made of steel plates. There are, however, couple of problems involved in using <b>mechanical</b> <b>anchors</b> such as high cost of manufacturing, installation and inspection, corrosion risk and durability and making fatigue prone points in steel structures due to drilling. Increasing demands on strengthening technique incorporating prestressing necessitate new techniques for controlling the interfacial stresses in the bonded joint without using <b>mechanical</b> <b>anchors.</b> In this paper, possible techniques to reduce the magnitude of the interfacial stresses along the bond line have been investigated. The methods include changing the geometric and mechanical properties of the strengthening components and modifying the distribution of interfacial stresses along the bond line. FE-analysis has been used to examine the effectiveness of each technique. It has been shown that using step prestressing method is the most effective one and by that interfacial stresses might be reduced by a factor of ten, which in many cases allows using high initial presressing forces in the laminate without the need to use <b>mechanical</b> <b>anchors...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{adhesion}} between electrolessly deposited {{copper and}} dielectric materials {{for use in}} microelectronic devices is investigated. The microelectronics industry requires continuous advances due to ever-evolving technology and the corresponding need for higher density substrates with smaller features. At the same time, adhesion must be maintained {{in order to preserve}} package reliability and mechanical performance. In order to meet these requirements two approaches were taken: smoothing the surface of traditional epoxy dielectric materials while maintaining adhesion, and increasing adhesion on advanced dielectric materials through chemical bonding and <b>mechanical</b> <b>anchoring.</b> It was found that NH 3 plasma treatments can be effective for increasing both catalyst adsorption and adhesion across a range of materials. This adhesion is achieved through increased nitrogen content on the polymer surface, specifically N=C. This nitrogen interacts with the palladium catalyst particles to form chemical anchors between the polymer surface and the electroless copper layer without the need for roughness. Chemical bonding alone, however, did not enable sufficient adhesion but needed to be supplemented with <b>mechanical</b> <b>anchoring.</b> Traditional epoxy materials were treated with a swell and etch process to roughen the surface and create <b>mechanical</b> <b>anchoring.</b> This same process was found to be ineffective when used on advanced dielectric materials. In order to create controlled roughness on these surfaces a novel method was developed that utilized blends of traditional epoxy with the advanced materials. Finally, combined treatments of surface roughening followed by plasma treatments were utilized to create optimum interfaces between traditional or advanced dielectric materials and electroless copper. In these systems adhesion was measured over 0. 5 N/mm with root-mean-square surface roughness as low as 15 nm. In addition, the individual contributions of chemical bonding and <b>mechanical</b> <b>anchoring</b> were identified. The plasma treatment conditions used in these experiments contributed up to 0. 25 N/mm to adhesion through purely chemical bonding with minimal roughness generation. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>anchoring</b> accounted for the remainder of adhesion, 0. 2 - 0. 8 N/mm depending on the level of roughness created on the surface. Thus, optimized surfaces with very low surface roughness and adequate adhesion were achieved by sequential combination of roughness formation and chemical modifications. Ph. D.

There are three basic styles of wedge anchors: fully threaded, partial threaded and the full-bodied wedge anchor. As shown in the figure, tightening the bolt results in a wedge being driven up against a sleeve. This jams the end of the bolt, and provides the strength. Many different manufacturers provide a variation on this theme, usually depending on the condition of the concrete, and the type of load. If a <b>mechanical</b> <b>anchor</b> fails, it is usually in the form of pulling out a wedge of concrete, and for this reason, proper design looks at the depth of embedment and ensures that the bolts are not spaced too closely.|$|E

Because of this potential to reduce roof falls and improve ground control conditions, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{has an interest in}} the types of roof bolts that are used by the coal industry. Further, NIOSH has conducted research into how various support parameters can affect the number of roof falls that occur, including support type.

40|$|AbstractIn this work, {{the effect}} of {{mechanical}} pre-treatment on the surface structure of carbon fibre-reinforced epoxy composites and on its peel strength of electroless/electroplated copper was investigated. Sandblasting with Al 2 O 3 was used to pre-treat the composite surface. The parameters investigated were blasting time (3 s, 6 s and 9 s) and nozzle distance to substrate (300 mm and 500 mm). A two-step metallization process was used for depositing copper coatings on the pre-treated composite surface. First, an eletroless plating process was used to deposit a thin layer on the surface. Second, an electroplating process was used to reinforce {{the thickness of the}} coating. Increased blasting intensity leads to a significant increase in surface roughness, which promotes <b>mechanical</b> <b>anchoring</b> effects of the coating.

The {{results showed that the}} addition of such compatibilizers readily improved the tensile and flexural strengths of the composites. However, no significant variation in the mechanical properties was observed for composite formulations comprising different isocyanate compounds. Accordingly, the chemical structure of isocyanate derivatives did not affect extensively the mechanical properties of MDI-coupled pine fiber reinforced composites. These results were similar to those obtained in previous studies regarding the efficiency of organosilane coupling agents. In comparison to monoreactive isocyanates, the addition of MIDI increased considerably the mechanical properties of pine fiber-polypropylene composites. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>anchoring</b> of polymeric PP chains onto the irregular reinforcement surface supported this result. Non-isothermal DSC analysis showed a slowing effect of MDI on the crystallization kinetics of the coupled composites.

HCP is a thin plate of Strain Hardening Cementitious Composite (SHCC) reinforced with Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) laminates. For this purpose, an experimental program composed of two series of beams (rectangular and T cross section) was executed to assess the strengthening efficiency of this technique. In {{the first step of}} this experimental program, the control beams, without steel stirrups, were loaded up to their shear failure, and fully unloaded. Then, these pre-damaged beams were shear strengthened by applying HCPs to their lateral faces by using a combination of epoxy adhesive and <b>mechanical</b> <b>anchors.</b> The bolts were applied with a certain torque in order to increase the concrete confinement. The obtained results showed that the increase of load carrying capacity of the damaged strengthened beams when HCPs were applied with epoxy adhesive and <b>mechanical</b> <b>anchors</b> was 2 and 2. 5 times of the load carrying capacity of the corresponding reference beams (without HCPs) for the rectangular and T cross section beam series, respectively. To further explore the potentialities of the HCPs technique for the shear strengthening, the experimental tests were simulated using an advanced numerical model by a FEM-based computer program.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the efficiency of Hybrid Composite Plates (HCPs) in enhancing the shear strength and stiffness of reinforced concrete (RC) beams. HCP is a thin plate of Strain Hardening Cementitious Composite (SHCC) reinforced with Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) laminates applied to the sides of reinforced concrete beams according to the Near Surface Mounted technique (NSM). Due to the excellent bond conditions between SHCC and CFRP laminates, these reinforcements provide the necessary tensile strength capacity to the HCP. To examine the efficiency of HCPs as a shear strengthening technique, a total of 17 RC beams are tested. Seven of these beams have a rectangular cross-section and ten have a T cross-section. The influence of the percentage and inclination of the CFRP laminates on the shear strengthening effectiveness of HCPs is investigated. Two different processes for applying the HCPs to the beams’ concrete substrate are examined: 1) using epoxy adhesive; and 2) using <b>mechanical</b> <b>anchors</b> in addition to the epoxy adhesive. It is demonstrated that when only epoxy adhesive is used, the shear strengthening contribution of the HCPs is limited by the tensile strength of the concrete substrate of the strengthened beams. When <b>mechanical</b> <b>anchors</b> are applied in addition to the epoxy adhesive, the shear strengthening potential of HCPs is fully mobilized. An analytical model is proposed to predict the shear strength of RC beams strengthened with HCPs.

These include: • Bioadhesion with <b>mechanical</b> <b>anchoring</b> using ubiquitous surface roughness and deformability of certain micro-organisms. • Physico-chemical bioadhesion or repellence resulting mainly from the energy characteristics of support surfaces. • Processes of sorting and guidance by biomolecules present at the support–biofilm interface, generating biochemical responses that can induce cell multiplication or degeneration (as in cancer), or cell death...|$|R
40|$|Using bonded fiber {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) laminates for strengthening {{and repair}} of structural members {{has been proven}} {{to be an effective}} and economic method. High strength and stiffness, light weight and good fatigue and durability properties of FRP composites together with advantages offered by adhesive bonding have made FRP bonding a suitable alternative for traditional strengthening and repair techniques. It has also been recognized that pre-stressing the FRP laminates prior to bonding would bring additional advantages such as reduced crack widths, postponing the yielding in tensile reinforcement, increasing the load bearing capacity and saving reinforcement material. Using pre-stressed laminates, however, is associated with very high interfacial stresses in the bond line at the laminate ends, which necessitates the use of <b>mechanical</b> <b>anchors.</b> This paper presents a new method and a device for applying pre-stressed FRP laminates to flexural structural members without the need for mechanical anchorage of the laminates...|$|R
