500|$|When {{the miners}} from Nome, Dawson, Rampart, {{and other places}} arrived in the Tanana Valley, they were {{disappointed}} with what they found. Hundreds of claims were staked, but none were close to Pedro's discovery claims, which had been taken by {{the crew of the}} Isabelle and other early arrivers. Adding to the pressure on claiming land were men who, like Barnette, had power of attorney rights for others, and could thus make <b>multiple</b> <b>claims.</b> The Dawson Daily News reported that one man claimed 144 portions of [...] apiece. Around Barnette's trading post, town lots were claimed for $2.50 apiece, and there was fierce competition for the choicest spots. At the mouth of the Chena River, a competing settlement, named Chena, sprang up when two traders moved their store to the junction of the two rivers. Land speculation was fierce in Chena, where claims were frequently stolen and had to be enforced with firearms.|$|E

500|$|The English {{archaeologist}} Timothy Taylor critically discussed Arens' work in {{his book}} The Buried Soul: How Humans Invented Death (2002). Proclaiming that [...] "there is now overwhelming biological, anthropological and archaeological evidence that cannibalism was once all around us", he attacked Arens for his blanket and [...] "bizarre" [...] accusations against the concept of cultural anthropophagy. He argued that The Man-Eating Myth had become so influential upon publication because it was what a generation of anthropological and archaeological students wanted to hear, not because it represented a coherent argument, citing P.G. Rivière's negative review in Man. Commenting {{on the situation in}} archaeology, he felt that following the publication of Arens' work, archaeologists had ceased to cite cannibalism as an explanation, {{to the detriment of the}} discipline itself. Presenting evidence to counter Arens' claims, Taylor cites the accounts of cannibalism among Pom and Passon, two chimpanzees of Gombe National Park whose anti-social activities were recorded by Jane Goodall, and from this discusses the evolutionary benefits of cannibalism. Proceeding to defend various ethnographic accounts of cultural cannibalism, he argues that this thoroughly disproves the beliefs which [...] "Arensite" [...] anthropologists find it [...] "comfortable or fashionable" [...] to believe. Later in The Buried Soul, he proclaims that Arens' book is pervaded by a [...] "hollow certainty of viscerally insulated inexperience", and he claims that such a flawed methodology has echoes in the anthropologist Jean La Fontaine's [...] (1998); Taylor himself suggests that <b>multiple</b> <b>claims</b> of the Satanic ritual abuse have been incorrectly dismissed for being considered [...] "improbable".|$|E

Multiple peer-reviewed comprehensive review articles and independent reviews by governmental regulatory bodies have analyzed the published research on the safety of aspartame and have found aspartame is safe for consumption at current levels.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{issues in}} the design of a co-operative member's contractual relationship with the other agents (including the remaining members) using organizational economics. The paper assumes that the central defining characteristic of a co-op is the residual claim specification. Agency theory identifies certain inherent problems of the co-op form, the horizon problem, common property problem, and non-transferability. Non-transferability both reduces the incentive to monitor and imposes limits on portfolio diversification. This paper argues that features such as claim incompleteness and non-transferability are not inherent to the co-op but may be transaction-cost economizing. The paper also argues that the pre-emptive payoff feature by which the residual claimants (the co-op members) also become fixed payoff agents can affect the risk of other agents, and is an important determinant of co-op risk. A co-op may have more than one potential residual claim base. Five generic design choices are available for handling possible <b>multiple</b> <b>claim</b> bases: battleground, pre-specified allocation, limited return, alignment, and fixed payoff. The paper uses the design of residual claims in sugar co-ops to show how a co-op can partly overcome some of the problems identified by agency theory. This illustration ties together the issues of claim incompleteness and non-transferability, pre-emptive payoff, and <b>multiple</b> <b>claim</b> bases. Copyright CIRIEC, 2003. ...|$|R

2500|$|Justice Stevens's {{concurrence}} in {{the judgment}} {{is different from the}} other two because he wishes to distinguish between different kinds of classifications. [...] Stevens states that [...] " [...] classification based on marital status is fundamentally different from a classification which determines who may lawfully enter into the marriage relationship." [...] In making this distinction, Stevens wishes to separate Zablocki and Loving from Califano v. Jobst. [...] The intent of his opinion is to illustrate that distinctions between married and unmarried people are largely acceptable, whereas bars to marriage itself should be treated with skepticism. [...] Further, he too concludes that the methods of Wisconsin's law fall far short of achieving its objectives (reasoning through <b>multiple</b> <b>claims</b> that Wisconsin's desired outcome does not comport with the reality of the situation).|$|E
