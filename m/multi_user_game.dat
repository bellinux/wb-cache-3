5000|$|Skills usually {{influence}} a character's chance to succeed by {{adding to the}} relevant attribute. In some games (such as GURPS), each skill has a specific base attribute {{to which it is}} always added; in others (such as Ars Magica), a skill can be added to different attributes depending on how the skill is being used. Some games (such as Feng Shui) add the base attribute to the skill at character creation time; after that, it is independent of the attribute and is used instead of the attribute rather than adding to it. Most games have a fixed penalty for attempting a task without a relevant skill; older editions of Shadowrun gave a complex network of penalties for using similar skills (such as attempting to pick an electronic lock by using the Computer skill instead of the Electronics skill). The text-based roleplaying game Avalon: The Legend Lives is noted for being the first text based <b>multi</b> <b>user</b> role-playing <b>game</b> to offer a developed profession and skills system [...] Choosing a profession then conveyed a bank of general skills and guild specific ones each containing a ladder of skills which could be invested in via lessons earned through on-line play. Initially there were around 30 such skills with approximately 17 abilities in each covering a wide range from Riding, Perception, Thievery or Demonology. As of 2015 Avalon possesses 66 Skills with a staggering 2194 distinct abilities developed over its 26-year tenure.|$|R

Historically rooted, role-playing has been popular long before Shakespeare, and {{starting in the}} early 1990 s, has moved into the computer. Now more than ever, {{it serves as a}} form of entertainment, escape and self-exploration to {{hundreds of thousands of people}} worldwide. In interactive, text-based computer games that are designed to represent fantasy worlds, players become authors not only of text but of themselves, constructing new selves through social interaction. On a MUD (<b>Multi</b> <b>User</b> Domain) <b>game,</b> places and selves are completely constructed through text.

Since the complexity of optimal data detection and decoding makes practical implementation infeasible. Recently, iterative multiuser techniques which lowers {{the complexity of the}} decoder have attracted attention. These techniques exploits the turbo principle of the well known turbo codes. In this thesis the iterative <b>multi</b> <b>user</b> detection principle is used between the <b>multi</b> <b>user</b> detector for multiple-access signalling struc-ture and the turbo code as the error control code. This method is often called iterative <b>multi</b> <b>user</b> turbo detection. The two detectors exchange soft information in order to achieve increased performance.

A Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) resource allocation technique offers the opportunity of a detailed link adaptation scheme. The combination of these transmission- and multiple access techniques in OFDM-FDMA is an ideal and very strong candidate for the downlink of future 4 G mobile communication systems. This technical combination offers high cell capacities by exploiting the inherent <b>multi</b> <b>user</b> diversity effect of the system. To apply OFDM-FDMA in the uplink, the time and carrier synchronization accuracy becomes very important. Non-ideal synchronization of the user signals to the carrier frequency of the base station leads to intercarrier interferences (ICI).

40|$|Abstract — Multicast and Broadcast Service (MBS) is {{intended}} to efficiently use system resources by transmitting same data to <b>multi</b> <b>users</b> simultaneously. MBS is composed of either single BS or multiple BS. In single BS access, each BS transmits MBS data to user which belong to its own BS. In multiple BS access, BSs in the same geographical area composes the MBS zone to transmit the same data to <b>multi</b> <b>users</b> simultaneously. MBS users combine MBS signals which belong to same MBS zone. Link adaption {{is intended}} to enhance the spectral efficiency of MBS using user’s feedback information. It is difficult to enable link adaption algorithm, because channel information reporting for <b>multi</b> <b>users</b> result in {{a large amount of}} uplink overhead. Therefore the conventional methods are developed in order to reduce this overhead. However the conventional methods consider single BS access. This paper presents a dynamic Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) and power control for MBS zone with limited channel information. The proposed algorithm enhances spectral efficiency of MBS zone. The performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed in terms of throughput and transmission power. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by computer simulation...|$|R
