The algorithm does not require any additional restriction on the deterministic transition delays that can have any positive real value.

30|$|It {{seems very}} {{interesting}} and important to us that among those eight students that assigned themselves zero <b>marks,</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> received 10 of 40 marks from the teacher. The other seven received between 17 and 26 out of 40 and thus scored around the average value. Among the 24 students that gave themselves the full 10 marks, we find five out of those six students that received {{less than or equal}} to 10 marks in the teacher-assessed part. This suggests that weak students in particular did not assess themselves very honestly. For a further development of self-assessment techniques, this effect has to be taken into account. More experiments are needed to see if the latter is a general trend or if the students in the long term will assess themselves in a reasonable fashion.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{the packet}} classification, the route and {{resources}} allocated to a packet {{are determined by}} the destination address as well as other header fields of the packet such as source/destination address, TCP and UDP port numbers. It has been demonstrated that performing packet classification on a potentially large number of fields is difficult and has poor worst-case performance. In this work, we proposed an enhanced tu-ple pruning search algorithm called “Tuple Pruning + ” that provides fast two-dimension packet classification. With reasonable extra filters added for Information <b>Marker,</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> hash access to the tuples is required. Through experiments, about 8 MB memory is required for 100 K-filter database and 20 million packet per second (MPPS) is achievable. The re-sults demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is suitable for high-speed packet classification. ...|$|R

Finally there were completed promotional program and materials for every target group. Methods: The analysis of the competition was performed by using scoring model and the individual criteria were subsequently evaluated. Next the SWOT analysis was also prepared. There were analyzed strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and threats. Also the interviewes with selected clients of fitness center were conducted. Results: The analysis of the competition showed that the biggest threat is for Esporta Fitness Club newly opened centre Pulse Wellness and Fitness. Mainly due to the favorable price offered to its clients and a wide range of services. The interviews with longtime clients showed that four out of five of those surveyed are satisfied with the fitness center and want to continue to visit it. <b>Only</b> <b>one</b> client said that knows even better fitness center.

40|$|We {{present results}} {{regarding}} the dynamical meteorology of Jupiter’s White Ovals {{at different points}} in their evolution. Starting from the era with three White Ovals FA, BC, and DE (Galileo), continuing to the post-merger epoch with <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>Oval</b> BA (Cassini), and finally to Oval BA’s current reddened state (New Horizons), we demonstrate that the dynamics of their flow have similarly evolved along with their appearance. In the Galileo epoch, Oval DE had an elliptical shape with peak zonal wind speeds of ∼ 90 m s− 1 in both its northern and southern peripheries. During the post-merger epoch, Oval BA’s shape was more triangular and less elliptical than Oval DE; in addition to widening in the north-south direction, its northern periphery was 20 m s− 1 slower, and its southern periphery was 20 m s− 1 faster than Oval DE’s flow during the Galileo era. Finally, in the New Horizons era, the reddened Oval BA had evolved back to a classical elliptical form. The northern periphery of Oval BA increased in speed by 20 m s− 1 from Cassini to New Horizons, ending up at a speed nearly identical to that of the northern periphery of Oval DE during Galileo. However, the peak speeds along the southern rim of the newly formed Oval BA were consistently faster than the corresponding speeds in Oval DE, and they increased still further between Cassini and New Horizons, ending up at ∼ 140 to 150 m s− 1. a...|$|R

Starting from the era with three White Ovals FA, BC, and DE (Galileo), continuing to the post-merger epoch with <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>Oval</b> BA (Cassini), and finally to Oval BA's current reddened state (New Horizons), we demonstrate that the dynamics of their flow have similarly evolved along with their appearance. The northern periphery of Oval BA increased in speed by 20 m/s from Cassini to New Horizons, ending up at a speed nearly identical to that of the northern periphery of Oval DE during Galileo. However, the peak speeds along the southern rim of the newly formed Oval BA were consistently faster than the corresponding speeds in Oval DE, and they increased still further between Cassini and New Horizons, ending up at ~ 140 to 150 m/s. The modest strengthening of the winds in Oval BA, the appearance of red aerosols, and the appearance of a turbulent, cyclonic feature to Oval BA's northwest create a strong resemblance with the Great Red Spot from both a dynamical and morphological perspective. In addition to the White Ovals, we also measure the winds within two compact cyclonic regions, one in the Galileo data set and one in the Cassini data set. In the images, these cyclonic features appear turbulent and filamentary, but our wind field reveals that the flow manifests as a coherent high-speed collar surrounding relatively quiescent interiors. Although less studied than their anticyclonic cousins, these cyclones may offer crucial insights into the planet's cloud-level energetics and dynamical meteorology. Comment: 38 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, IP {{networks}} are rapidly evolving toward a QoS-enabled infrastructure. The need for packet classification is increasing {{in accordance with}} emerging differentiated services. While the new differentiated services could significantly {{increase the number of}} rules, it has been demonstrated that performing packet classification on a potentially large number of rules is difficult and has poor worst-case performance. In this work, we present an enhanced tuple pruning search algorithm called "Tuple Pruning Plus" (TPP) for packet classification, which outperforms the existing schemes on the scalability. Our main idea is to simplify the lookup procedure and to avoid unnecessary tuple probing by maintaining the least-cost property of rule through precomputation and the proposed Information Marker. With extra rules added for In,formation <b>Marker,</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> tuple access is required in each packet classification. In our experiments, 70 MB DRAM is used to achieve 50 million packets per second (MPPS) for a 1 M-rule set, showing a performance improvement by a factor of 50.
