5|$|A {{number of}} genetically {{discrete}} subpopulations {{have been identified}} across the northern range of the Pacific angelshark. Several subpopulations exist along the coast from Point Conception northward to Alaska. In the Southern California Bight, {{there are at least}} three separate subpopulations off the <b>mainland</b> <b>and</b> northern and southern Channel Islands. The subpopulation along the Pacific coast of Baja California are distinct from those in the Gulf of California. These subpopulations have diverged from one another over time because Pacific angelsharks do not undertake long migratory movements outside of their preferred home areas, and deep waters serve as effective geographical barriers to population mixing. Heterozygosity, a measure of genetic diversity, is higher in the Pacific angelshark than in other shark species that have been examined.|$|E

5|$|Another siege {{was mounted}} in 1727 but the Spanish failed to retake Gibraltar, as the British {{were once again}} able to {{reinforce}} and resupply the garrison by sea. Following the siege, the Spanish began the construction in 1730 of the Lines of Contravallation, a fortified structure across the entire width of the isthmus anchored by two major forts on each end. This was intended to block access from Gibraltar to the Spanish <b>mainland,</b> <b>and</b> also {{to serve as a}} base for any future sieges. The territory's importance increased following Britain's defeat in the Battle of Minorca in 1756, when a French naval victory led to the surrender of the British garrison there.|$|E

However, Balon refuses and vows to send more troops to stage another {{invasion}} of the North. As Balon heads outside, he encounters his brother, Euron Greyjoy, who has come to overthrow him. Balon attempts to stab Euron, who throws him off a bridge to his death. At Balon's funeral, Yara swears revenge against Balon's killer, but is reminded by her uncle Aeron, a Drowned Priest, that her position as successor depends on the results of the Kingsmoot, a ceremony where the Ironborn elect their new leader.|$|E

5|$|In 1849 {{there were}} just 11 people living on the island {{but it was not}} long before the island farms expanded. In the 1850s gold was {{discovered}} on mainland Australia where crews would abandon their ships, preferring to dig for gold than to risk a life at sea. As a consequence many vessels avoided the <b>mainland</b> <b>and</b> Lord Howe Island experienced an increasing trade which peaked between 1855 and 1857. In 1851 about 16 people were living on the island. Vegetable crops now included potatoes, carrots, maize, pumpkin, taro, watermelon – even grapes, passionfruit and coffee. Between 1851 and 1853 there were several aborted proposals by the NSW Government to establish a penal settlement on the island.|$|E

Lamprophyre dykes of Late Permian age are found throughout Orkney. Glacial striation and the presence of chalk and flint erratics that originated from the bed of the North Sea demonstrate the influence of ice action on the geomorphology of the islands.

5|$|Most of {{the islands}} have a bedrock formed from Old Red Sandstone, which is about 400 million years old, and was laid down in the Devonian period.

The archipelago is exposed to wind and tide, and there are numerous lighthouses as an aid to navigation. The European Marine Energy Centre, which is located at Stromness, is currently testing various wave and tidal energy devices from Billia Croo on the <b>Mainland</b> <b>and</b> Eday. The islands all fall within the Orkney Islands Council area. Most of the larger islands have development trusts that support the local economy.|$|E

40|$|This article explores how Taiwanese people {{construct}} and recount their experiences of dementia in factual and fictional stories. It compares the narrative meanings in Taiwanese stories {{with those of}} analogous <b>mainland</b> Chinese <b>and</b> Hong Kong accounts. The article finds that the Taiwanese stories differ from their <b>mainland</b> Chinese <b>and</b> Hong Kong counterparts in three ways. First, the onset of dementia is largely an unforeseen calamity for the Taiwanese storytellers, while it is an anticipatable life circumstance for the <b>mainland</b> Chinese <b>and</b> Hong Kong storytellers. Second, the Taiwanese storytellers tend to locate the cause for the deterioration of their elderly family member in illness, while the <b>mainland</b> Chinese <b>and</b> Hong Kong storytellers tend to explain away the deterioration of their elderly family member as normative aging. Third, the Taiwanese storytellers maintain their existing identities {{when faced with the}} newfound challenge of family caregiving in dementia, while the <b>mainland</b> Chinese <b>and</b> Hong Kong storytellers commonly appropriate the former culturally embodied identity of the family member whom they now care for...|$|R
