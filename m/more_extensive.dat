5|$|Although a {{powerful}} cyclone over water, {{the storm had}} relatively little impact over land. In the Valsad district, two coastal communities lost a combined 200 homes due to large swells produced by the storm. However, the losses were <b>more</b> <b>extensive</b> offshore.

A {{slightly}} <b>more</b> <b>extensive</b> description of galaxy types {{based on their}} appearance is given by the Hubble sequence.
