5000|$|Collaro was {{the name}} of a major early British {{manufacturer}} of gramophones, record players, and tape decks, throughout the early years of sound reproduction. The company was founded in Barking, Essex, 1920, as Collaro Ltd, and was a private company in 1924. In 1961 it was described as the largest manufacturers of record changers in the United Kingdom, and also manufactured fan heaters. In 1960 it was reported in US publication 'Billboard' that the President of the American Magnavox corporation, Frank Freimann had announced the 'acquisition' of Collaro, along with managing director of Collaro, Isaac Wolfson. However, he is also reported as noting that [...] "the linking of the two firms carries not only product but distribution ramifications," [...] which suggests some sort of cooperative alliance with acquisition of selling rights rather than a total 'buy-out'. Isaac Wolfson, a major British industrialist, was at the time also the head of Great Universal Stores, a large chain of retail outlets throughout Britain, Continental Europe, and the British Empire, suggesting perhaps that an earlier link-up took place between Wolfson and the originators of Collaro. The record decks comprised the <b>mechanical</b> <b>unit</b> incorporating a turntable and pickup, without electronics, and were built into many manufactured and home-constructed record players of the time.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2004 The {{mechanical}} properties of individual stratigraphic layers in a multi-layer sequence of sedimentary rock influence the deformational response before, during, and after fold development. To demonstrate this, the mechanical character of stratigraphic layers and mesoscopic deformational structures within individual stratigraphic layers were documented in two well-exposed outcrop-scale detachment folds in the Lisburne Group carbonates, northeastern Brooks Range, Alaska. Fold geometry and fold-related mesoscopic structures indicate that flexural slip and flexural flow are the operative fold mechanisms until a critical interlimb angle of 90 ° is reached, after which homogenous flattening occurs. Changes in bed thicknesses due to homogenous flattening alter the overall fold geometry. Lithostratigraphic unit boundaries {{do not always}} coincide with <b>mechanical</b> <b>unit</b> boundaries. Thin shale layers lower the bedding interface strength and commonly form flexural slip horizons that define <b>mechanical</b> <b>unit</b> boundaries. As fold shortening progresses, slip horizon spacing is interpreted to decrease, causing <b>mechanical</b> <b>unit</b> thickness to decrease. Newly forming mechanical boundaries alter the conditions of deformation, which change the overall fold dynamics. Surveyed fracture sets reveal the influence of lithology, <b>mechanical</b> <b>unit</b> thickness, anisotropy, and structural position on fracture distribution within individual mechanical units. Fracture densities vary from set to set and unit to unit due to structural and stratigraphic controls within these folds...|$|E

One key element in this study was to find a suitable material with high sensing capabilities which can be used for developing a sensor. Thus different MR elastomers, with ingredients of carbonyl iron particle, graphite, silicone oil and silicone rubber, were manufactured and measured with a modified rheometer. The effects of additives on the sensing capabilities were systematically investigated and an optimal MR elastomer sample was selected for design and manufacturing of a force sensor prototype. The development sensor prototype consists of three units: <b>mechanical</b> <b>unit,</b> electrical circuit and LED display unit. The <b>mechanical</b> <b>unit</b> includes the MRE sample and the interface to the electronic circuit.
