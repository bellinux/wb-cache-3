40|$|As {{university}} supervisors we were {{alerted to}} heightened emotional responses (i. e., crying, not eating, not sleeping), expressed by paid-interns in an accelerated Master of Arts in Teaching (<b>M.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>T.)</b> cohort of STEM practitioners. While {{research has shown}} teachers prepared in alternative programs tend to have greater difficulties (Darling-Hammond, 1990), {{few studies have examined}} alternatively prepared teachers ’ beliefs and expectations about teaching and learning (Tigchlaar, Brouwer, & Vermut, 2010; Good et al., 2006). This inquiry describes one paid-intern’s teaching expectations during her first year of teaching. In this phenomenological case study, part of a larger cross-case study, we collected data from interviews, observation notes and university supervisor evaluations in an effort to answer: (1) What are the expectations about teaching of a student in an accelerated <b>M.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>T.</b> program who is also a first-year teacher completing a paid internship and (2) In what ways did she address those expectations? We utilized self-discrepancy theory (Higgins, 1987) that provides an understanding of how expectations can produce negative effects, such as anxiety or depression. Discoveries suggest the intern held idealistic expectations about teaching, influenced by her personality, prior experiences, and the accelerated <b>M.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>T.</b> program, which she could not reconcile wit...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The aim of {{this study}} was to use <b>M.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>T.</b> S (Microbial {{adhesion}} to solvents) in order to examine the influence of pH and ionic strength on electron donor/electron accep-tor properties and surface hydrophobicity of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Escherichia coli AL 52. Using this technique we found that the electron donor character for both strains was influenced by pH and ionic strength. This effect was more important for S. aureus. The electron acceptor was expressed for acidic pH. Regardless of pH, the electron donor character of S. aureus changed when the ionic strength increased from 10 - 3 M to 10 - 1 M. For E. coli, the electron donor character varied with ionic strength at pH 2, nevertheless, for other pH, this character was not influenced by ionic strength. Moreo-ver, surface hydrophobicity of two microbial cells surface was affected by pH and ionic strength. It was maximal at acidic pH and lower at basic pH for S. aureus. Regardless of pH and ionic strength, E. coli was hydrophilic.

When the allied forces came back to Indonesia, he tried to defend East Java {{although}} {{he had to be}} involved in the battle. His bravery and firmness against the allied forces became special spirit for people not to surrender. This study aims to describe: (1) the biography of R. <b>M.</b> <b>T.</b> <b>A.</b> Soerjo, (2) the conditions of East Java during the independence struggle, and (3) R. <b>M.</b> <b>T.</b> <b>A.</b> Soerjo’s roles in the struggle for the Indonesian independence in East Java in 1945 - 1947. The study employed the critical historical research method consisting of several stages. The first stage was the research topic selection, the second was heuristics or source collection, the third was verification or source criticism, the fourth was interpretation to give meanings to the collected historical facts, and the fifth was historiography or history writing. The research approaches were political and psychological approaches. The results of the study were as follows. (1) R. <b>M.</b> <b>T.</b> <b>A.</b> Soerjo was born in a Civil Service family and had a bright career in the Dutch, Japanese, and Indonesian governments but he had a tragic ending in the hands of Indonesian Communist Party. (2) East Java succeeded in establishing National Committee of Indonesia and People Security Agency in accordance with the mandate from the central government before R. <b>M.</b> <b>T.</b> <b>A.</b> Soerjo arrived in Surabaya. His arrival in Surabaya was followed by the landing of the allied forces in Surabaya. (3) R. <b>M.</b> <b>T.</b> <b>A.</b> Soerjo became the milestone for people’s struggle in East Java with the occurrence of the incident of 10 November 1945. He firmly refused the allied forces’ ultimatum to surrender weapons and leave Surabaya City. He held an emergency meeting before leaving Surabaya by asking the government to withdraw the allied forces from Surabaya. Through his decree, R. <b>M.</b> <b>T.</b> <b>A.</b> Soerjo gave an order to help Madura to cope with the lack of food stuff.
