Although {{they were originally}} assumed to be giant humanoid robots, the Evas are actually cyborgs, integrating a mostly biological being with a substantial <b>mechanical</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> including a capsule called an [...] "entry plug" [...] in which the pilot sits and controls the Eva's actions, though the extent of this control can waver. The only people who can pilot Evas are children whose mothers have died after the Second Impact, who are chosen by the Marduk Institute and designated in numeral order as [...] "children" [...] (i.e. First Child, Second Child). The reason of this is not explained for some time, until it is revealed that {{the souls of the}} pilots' mothers are integrated with the Evas to enable a psychic link between the two. Once connected to the Eva, the entry plug is filled with a translucent, breathable liquid known as LCL, which allows the pilots to electrochemically control the Evas. LCL is repeatedly described as smelling like blood and is revealed later on to be derived from the blood of the second Angel, Lilith. The pilots wear uniforms called plug suits and devices called interface headsets on their heads to achieve better synchronization with the Eva. Although the Evas wear armor, their most significant defense is the Absolute Terror Field (AT Field for short), a form of force field which protects the Eva from all forms of conventional damage and can be used to disrupt an Angel's AT field.|$|E

30|$|The casing string {{design has}} {{to follow the}} {{assumption}} of extremely high temperatures and highly corrosive and hostile, especially to the <b>mechanical</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> geothermal fluids, often with high concentrations of H 2 S, which might potentially lead to sulfide stress corrosion. In order to avoid casing failures, selection of casing strings directly exposed to the reservoir fluids (most commonly a 7 ″ liner pipe and a 9 5 / 8 ″ production casing) {{should be limited to}} casing materials designed for sour conditions. These steel grades include for instance API L- 80 and T- 95. In recent years, improved casing material such as TN 80 - 3 %Cr with lower corrosion rates is being employed for production casing string and liner pipe in the Los Humeros geothermal field due to the influence of hostile geothermal fluids from greater depths (Diez et al. 2015). The TN 125 SS casing material from the Venelle- 2 campaign was selected, due to its elastic behavior with the compression load, which is the governing load. Although TN 125 SS is not designed especially for sour conditions, it could be used in the presence of H 2 S with reservoir temperatures higher than 80  °C (Bertani et al. 2018).|$|E
40|$|Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is an {{emerging}} {{area of research}} associated to improvement of maintainability {{and the safety of}} aerospace, civil and <b>mechanical</b> <b>infrastructures</b> by means of monitoring and damage detection. Guided wave structural testing method is an approach for health monitoring of plate-like structures using smart material piezoelectric transducers. Among many kinds of transducers, the ones that have beam steering feature can perform more accurate surface interrogation. A frequency steerable acoustic transducer (FSATs) is capable of beam steering by varying the input frequency and consequently can detect and localize damage in structures. Guided wave inspection is typically performed through phased arrays which feature a large number of piezoelectric transducers, complexity and limitations. To overcome the weight penalty, the complex circuity and maintenance concern associated with wiring a large number of transducers, new FSATs are proposed that present inherent directional capabilities when generating and sensing elastic waves. The first generation of Spiral FSAT has two main limitations. First, waves are excited or sensed in one direction and in the opposite one (180 ̊ ambiguity) and second, just a relatively rude approximation of the desired directivity has been attained. Second generation of Spiral FSAT is proposed to overcome the first generation limitations. The importance of simulation tools becomes higher when a new idea is proposed and starts to be developed. The shaped transducer concept, especially the second generation of spiral FSAT is a novel idea in guided waves based of Structural Health Monitoring systems, hence finding a simulation tool is a necessity to develop various design aspects of this innovative transducer. In this work, the numerical simulation of the 1 st and 2 nd generations of Spiral FSAT has been conducted to prove the directional capability of excited guided waves through a plate-like structure...|$|R

30|$|Defining {{failure modes}} for studied wells {{proved to be}} difficult, {{due to the lack}} of {{detailed}} data, published well reports and literature available and authors had to base their knowledge on a small and limited amount of published data. From the 20 drilling projects presented in Table  1, drilled in or close to supercritical conditions, failure modes are known only for a few wells. In most cases, failure of the geothermal well was caused by excessively high thermally induced stresses exerted upon the casing string and couplings during operations such as well quenching or production kick-off causing casing collapse and/or connections rupture. Casing collapse in some cases might have been also propagated by bad cementing job commonly executed in zones of partial or total circulation loss. In few wells, blow-out or near-blow-out conditions were encountered, which in most cases precluded further drilling due to safety concerns. In older wells, not aimed to penetrate the supercritical resource, such as KJ- 39, NJ- 11, KS- 13 or San Vito- 1, the well design was not rated for such extreme temperature and pressure conditions and well completion was finalized at much shallower depths. Some of the mentioned wells, after reconstruction work, serve today as injection wells. In other wells, investigation of deeper supercritical resources had to be halted due to safety reasons of ejection of hostile gases, such as H 2 S, which might have promoted damages to the <b>mechanical</b> <b>infrastructure</b> as well as cause health and life danger. The heavy precipitation, corrosion, and erosion due to high flow rates of hostile and oftentimes hypersaline geothermal brines are also noted as serious issues, especially during fluid production and well testing.|$|E
