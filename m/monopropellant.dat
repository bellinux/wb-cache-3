25|$|NASA {{called for}} {{proposals}} for the rover's scientific instruments in April 2004, and eight proposals were selected on December 14 of that year. Testing {{and design of}} components also began in late 2004, including Aerojet's designing of a <b>monopropellant</b> engine {{with the ability to}} throttle from 15–100 percent thrust with a fixed propellant inlet pressure.|$|E
25|$|All current {{spacecraft}} use chemical rockets (bipropellant or solid-fuel) for launch, {{though some}} (such as the Pegasus rocket and SpaceShipOne) have used air-breathing engines {{on their first}} stage. Most satellites have simple reliable chemical thrusters (often <b>monopropellant</b> rockets) or resistojet rockets for orbital station-keeping and some use momentum wheels for attitude control. Soviet bloc satellites have used electric propulsion for decades, and newer Western geo-orbiting spacecraft are starting to use them for north-south stationkeeping and orbit raising. Interplanetary vehicles mostly use chemical rockets as well, although a few have used ion thrusters and Hall effect thrusters (two different types of electric propulsion) to great success.|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of operating small thrust level electrothermal thrusters with <b>monopropellants</b> other than MIL-grade hydrazine was studied. Analytical study, design, and fabrication of demonstration thrusters was performed, and an evaluation test program was initiated to evaluate <b>monopropellants</b> with freezing points lower than MIL-grade hydrazine, {{and to determine}} their applicability to electrothermal thrusters for spacecraft attitude control. Five demonstration thrusters were fabricated to determine the {{feasibility of}} operation with monomethylhydrazine, Aerozine- 50, 77 percent hydrazine- 23 percent hydrazine azide, and a mixture of hydrazine <b>monopropellants</b> consisting of 35 percent hydrazine- 50 percent monomethylhydrazine- 15 percent ammonia. The present thruster is designed to produce a steady-state thrust level of 0. 344 N at 1. 724 x 1 million N/M sq feed pressure.

5000|$|<b>Monopropellants</b> {{are also}} used in some air-independent {{propulsion}} systems (AIP) to [...] "fuel" [...] reciprocating or turbine engines in environments where free oxygen is unavailable. Weapons intended primarily for combat between nuclear-powered submarines generally fall into this category. The most commonly used propellant {{in this case is}} stabilized propylene glycol dinitrate (PGDN), often referred to as [...] "Otto fuel". A potential future use for <b>monopropellants</b> not directly related to propulsion is in compact, high-intensity powerplants for aquatic or exoatmospheric environments.|$|R
25|$|Rocket engines {{employ the}} {{principle}} of jet propulsion. The rocket engines powering rockets come in {{a great variety of}} different types; a comprehensive list can be found in rocket engine. Most current rockets are chemically powered rockets (usually internal combustion engines, but some employ a decomposing <b>monopropellant)</b> that emit a hot exhaust gas. A rocket engine can use gas propellants, solid propellant, liquid propellant, or a hybrid mixture of both solid and liquid. Some rockets use heat or pressure that is supplied from a source other than the chemical reaction of propellant(s), such as steam rockets, solar thermal rockets, nuclear thermal rocket engines or simple pressurized rockets such as water rocket or cold gas thrusters. With combustive propellants a chemical reaction is initiated between the fuel and the oxidizer in the combustion chamber, and the resultant hot gases accelerate out of a rocket engine nozzle (or nozzles) at the rearward-facing end of the rocket. The acceleration of these gases through the engine exerts force ("thrust") on the combustion chamber and nozzle, propelling the vehicle (according to Newton's Third Law). This actually happens because the force (pressure times area) on the combustion chamber wall is unbalanced by the nozzle opening; {{this is not the case}} in any other direction. The shape of the nozzle also generates force by directing the exhaust gas along the axis of the rocket.|$|E
500|$|The {{spacecraft}} uses a [...] {{fuel tank}} filled with [...] of hydrazine <b>monopropellant.</b> Fuel pressure is regulated by adding pressurized helium gas from an external tank. Seventy {{percent of the}} propellant was used for orbital insertion, and it has enough propellant to keep functioning into the 2030s.|$|E
2500|$|High-concentration [...] is {{referred}} to as [...] "high-test peroxide" [...] (HTP). It can be used either as a <b>monopropellant</b> (not mixed with fuel) or as the oxidizer component of a bipropellant rocket. Use as a <b>monopropellant</b> takes advantage of the decomposition of 70–98% concentration hydrogen peroxide into steam and oxygen. The propellant is pumped into a reaction chamber, where a catalyst, usually a silver or platinum screen, triggers decomposition, producing steam at over , which is expelled through a nozzle, generating thrust. [...] <b>monopropellant</b> produces a maximal specific impulse (Isp) of 161 s (1.6 kN·s/kg). Peroxide was the first major <b>monopropellant</b> adopted for use in rocket applications. Hydrazine eventually replaced hydrogen-peroxide <b>monopropellant</b> thruster applications primarily because of a 25% increase in the vacuum specific impulse. Hydrazine (toxic) and hydrogen peroxide (less-toxic [...] ) are the only two monopropellants (other than cold gases) to have been widely adopted and utilized for propulsion and power applications. The Bell Rocket Belt, reaction-control systems for X-1, X-15, Centaur, Mercury, Little Joe, as well as the turbo-pump gas generators for X-1, X-15, Jupiter, Redstone and Viking used hydrogen peroxide as a <b>monopropellant.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{high-pressure}} combustion {{properties of}} liquid <b>monopropellants</b> involving mixtures of hydroxyl ammonium nitrate (HAN), triethanol ammonium nitrate (TEAN), and water are considered theoretically. Liquid surface properties {{and the critical}} combustion pressure (the pressure required for the propellant surface to exceed its thermodynamic critical point) were found allowing for real-gas phenomena {{and the presence of}} dissolved combustion product gases in the liquid. Critical combustion pressures for the H_AN-based <b>monopropellants</b> were found to be unusually high, ca. 2500 atm, with an estimated uncertainty of 50 %.

Comparatively, the caliber 20 -mm regenerative test fixture guns results in smooth pressure curves when firing nitromethane based <b>monopropellants.</b> Tailoring of the pressure-time history yields higher performance.

2500|$|Nitrous oxide {{also may}} be used in a <b>monopropellant</b> rocket. In the {{presence}} of a heated catalyst, [...] will decompose exothermically into nitrogen and oxygen, at a temperature of approximately [...] Because of the large heat release, the catalytic action rapidly becomes secondary, as thermal autodecomposition becomes dominant. In a vacuum thruster, this may provide a <b>monopropellant</b> specific impulse (Isp) of as much as 180 s. While noticeably less than the Isp available from hydrazine thrusters (<b>monopropellant</b> or bipropellant with dinitrogen tetroxide), the decreased toxicity makes nitrous oxide an option worth investigating.|$|E
