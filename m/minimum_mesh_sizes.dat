40|$|Most of {{the fishing}} gears are {{selective}} for certain length range of fish thus excluding very small and very big fish. This property of fishing gears is termed as gear selectivity. Thompson and Ben-Yami (1984) considered selectivity as the capacity of any method of gear type to capture certain fractions or sections of the fish population whether grouped by species, age, size or behaviour and to exclude others. Gear selectivity needs to be considered when we go for estimation of size composition of fish. The ultimate aim of studies on size selection is to suggest suitable mesh sizes to catch fish of either economically optimum size or an optimum size for the judicial exploitation of the stock. It is an important tool for fisheries managers for regulating the <b>minimum</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes</b> of fishing fleet by determining the minimum sizes of the target species in certain fisheries.

40|$|Research PaperRecent {{research}} has warned that liberalising trade in capture fishery products originating from inefficient managed fisheries might cause over-exploitation, reduced fish stocks and thereby reduced steady state welfare. This paper qualifies the warning {{in a case}} study of the East Baltic cod market by introducing a quantitative supply model of the fishery with year classes. Welfare effects of trade liberalisation are identified taking minimum size limits and <b>minimum</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes</b> into account and it is shown that even though liberalising trade supplied by such a fishery might cause long steady state welfare reductions in the supplier countries, this welfare reduction is almost solely related to economic over-exploitation through too large fishing costs more than to biological over-exploitation. Thus, the welfare effects of trade liberalisation are generally small and in particular for fishing mortalities well above the maximum sustainable yield. The consequence is that the argument that warns against trade liberalisation in certain situations gains less validity and conventional wisdom following from the Neo-classical theoretical tradition regains validity at several and probably most fish markets globally...|$|E
40|$|Many {{technical}} measures {{aimed at the}} conservation and recovery of fish stocks {{are based on the}} implementation of <b>minimum</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes</b> to guarantee a certain level of fishing gear selectivity. At present, different methods are used to measure mesh opening, according to whether the measurement serves fisheries inspection, fisheries research or the manufacturing of netting for fishing nets. At the very least, this causes confusion but can also have more serious consequences such as the criminalization of well intentioned fishermen or the setting of inappropriate mesh size regulations. For example, the measurements made by fishery inspectors using the wedge gauge are generally larger than those made by scientists using the ICES gauge. As a result the cod-ends used by fishermen to satisfy the fishery inspectors will have a selectivity lower than that anticipated by the scientists who provided the advice that informed the relevant legislation. In 1999, owing to the wider range of twines and netting materials used by the fishing industry, ICES established the Study Group on Mesh Measurement Methodology (SGMESH) to refine mesh measurement procedures. At the same time the different stakeholders agreed that there was a need to consider the adoption of a standard mesh measurement method. A major step in the standardization of mesh measurement methodologies was {{the development of a new}} standard mesh gauge (2002 - 2005). In October 2005, it was adopted by ICES as the new standard for mesh measurements and in June 2006 the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) recommended its use for scientific purposes. This review paper critically examines the different mesh measurement methodologies and their related problems, and introduces and describes a new objective mesh gauge (OMEGA) to replace the former less satisfactory gauges. Its adoption will result in researchers, fisheries inspectors and the netting industry using one standard gauge and one set of standard protocols to achieve consistent mesh-size measurements...|$|E
40|$|Research PaperAs a Member State of the European Community (EC), the United Kingdom's marine capture {{fisheries}} must {{be managed}} {{within the framework}} of the Community's common fisheries policy (see Box 1). Since 1983 this has included a system of annual total allowable catches (TACs) for most commercially important stocks within the zone of extended fisheries jurisdiction created by the 200 -mile limits of all the EC Member States with coastlines bordering the North East Atlantic and adjacent seas. The TACs are divided into national catch quotas according to an established allocation mechanism which gives each Member State a fixed percentage share each year (although a number of international quota swaps are regularly undertaken). While the national fishing fleets are subject to certain common input controls under the common fisheries policy (in particular technical conservation measures such as <b>minimum</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes)</b> each Member State is free to determine the means for allocating its quotas and for regulating quota uptake. EC rules do, however, require all vessels of 10 metres or over in length to keep a logbook of their activities which must include details of the quantities of TAC species caught and retained on board and the time and location of capture. Inshore vessels of less than 10 metres long are not obliged to carry logbooks but Member States are still required to monitor their landings to ensure that national quota limits are respected. Figure 1 shows the sea areas surrounding the United Kingdom according to the ICES nomenclature used to denominate fish stocks in the North East Atlantic.

The results suggest that an increase in the current <b>minimum</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> of 55 - 70 mm would be advisable to be compatible with the minimum landing sizes (MLSs) of 29 mm carapace length and 27 cm total length for red shrimp and hake, respectively, while it would greatly reduce the amount of discards, particularly those for blue whiting, that accounted for approximately 50 % of the total catch weight. Horse mackerel was the only species for which the use of a larger <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> would result in a significant escapement of individuals above the MLS of 15 cm. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.

30|$|As for simulation, we use 3 -D finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The {{corresponding}} {{software is}} Lumerical FDTD. The refractive indexes of dielectric (SiO 2) and metal (tungsten) are both adopted from the experiment data [23, 24]. As the metal nanoparticle layers consist of infinite continuous nanoparticles, we choose one metal nanoparticle cell as the simulation model. We plot a unit cell of the periodical single-layer NPA structure in Fig.  1 b. A normally incident TM light is incident along the negative y {{direction with the}} polarization along the x direction. Therefore, the simulation period P {{is the same as}} the diameter of the metal nanoparticle (20  nm). The <b>minimum</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> is set as 0.1  nm. Periodical boundary condition is adopted for single unit cell in Fig.  1 b. Perfect match layers (PML) are adopted at the bottom and top of the structure. The absorbance is calculated as A[*]=[*] 1 [*]−[*]R[*]−[*]T, where R is the reflection and T is the transmission. The thickness of the metal substrate is set as 300  nm, which is much larger than its typical skin depth to avoid transmitting light. Thus, there is nearly no transmittance in the overall frequency range, and the absorbance of the absorber can be calculated as A[*]=[*] 1 [*]−[*]R.|$|R
50|$|Gillnets are {{designed}} to harvest a specific sized fish. For example, Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife's 2010 Commercial Regulations had a 7 in <b>minimum</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> restriction for Chinook, and a 5 in minimum - 5.5 in maximum for sockeye. Possible problems arising from this selective harvest are smaller reproducing adult fish, {{as well as the}} unexpected mortality of the fish which sustain injuries from the gillnet but are not retained in the fishery. Most salmon populations include several age classes, allowing for fish of different ages, and sizes, to reproduce with each other. A recent 2009 study looked at 59 years of catch and escapement data of Bristol Bay sockeye to determine age and size at maturity trends attributable to the selectivity of commercial gillnet harvests. The study found that the larger females (>550 mm) of all age classes were most susceptible to harvest. The study suggests that smaller, younger fish were more likely to successfully traverse the gillnet fishery and reproduce than the larger fish. The study also found that the average length of sockeye harvested from 1946-2005 was 8 mm larger than the sockeye who escaped the gillnet fishery to spawn, reducing the fecundity of the average female by 5%, or 104 eggs.|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} done at Kayinja landing site, {{one of the six}} gazzeted landing sites located on the eastern side of Lake George, Kamwenge {{district}} to investigate illegal fishing practices on the lake. The objectives of the study were to identify the fish species most affected by illegal fishing, factors that drive illegal fishing on the lake, impact of illegal fishing to the fishery and livelihoods of the communities around the lake and to find out the prospect of ending illegal fishing on the lake. A participatory approach was used during the study where fishers and fisheries staff were interviewed for the fish species targeted, current management approach so as to find out species at risk and anticipate the prospect or ending illegal fishing respectively also past records of the daily catch ror a period of five years were used to study the trend henee ascertain the impact of illegal fishing to the fishery and livelihoods of the communities around. Results indicated that the most targeted fish hence other wise affected by illegal fishing is Oreochromis niloticus, the most immediate impact being a decline in fish stocks, whereas defining mechanisms to increase fish stocks through closed seasons and implementation of <b>minimum</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> policy being the prospect to end illegal fishing on the lake...|$|R
40|$|Length {{frequency}} {{data was}} collected for the 6 main species from the Kainji Lake fishery for up to 16 months. Growth parameters were estimated and used for virtual - population and length based cohort analysis. The results from cohort analysis suggest that before the ban on beach seines the maximum economic yield from the fishery was overshot by 70 %. Yield per recruit analysis showed that the fish are caught far below their optimum size. Fishing gears and the timing responsible for this early mortality have been identified. After the eradication of seines from the lake a 10 % increase in total catch revenue can be expected from the fishery. This is equivalent {{to an increase in}} income of Naira 18, 300 per annum for each fishing entrepreneur using other methods. A scenario for the regulation of cast net <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> together with the ban of beach seines has been presented. A further increase of Naira 142 million (N 25, 500 per entrepreneur) can be anticipated if this is implemented by the Kainji Lake Fisheries Management and Conservation Unit. It is expected that the annual increase in fishing effort presently experienced will cause future yields to decline. The rate of the decline has been reduced by the eradication of the beach seine fishery and will further fall if the <b>minimum</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> for cast nets is implemented. A recommendation is made to the Kainji Lake Fisheries Management and Conservation Unit to first consolidate the beach seine ban and then to implement a ban of undersized cast nets.
