50|$|Linguistically, Poland may {{be placed}} in Eastern Europe because the {{official}} and most widely spoken language {{of the state is}} Polish - one of the West Slavic languages generally associated with the eastern section of the continent. Using historical and cultural criteria, Poland can be identified as Western Europe as well, due to customs and cuisine it used to share with Italy, and France. For instance, Queen Bona Sforza revolutionized Polish eating habits after 1518 with unknown vegetables, fruits and legumes which became Poland's staples for centuries to come. Queen Marie Louise Gonzaga introduced French specialties and brought with her scores of craftsmen, cooks and pâté makers along with table customs considered innately Polish today. Poland shares customs and cuisine with present-day Belarus and Ukraine also, much of it stemming from their common heritage as the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Multiple supranational organizations of significance categorize Poland as an Eastern European country for statistical purposes, including the Statistics Division of the United Nations and EuroVoc (the <b>multilingual</b> <b>thesaurus)</b> of the European Union. Several other agencies of the UN also place Poland in Eastern Europe. Another common definition identifies the former Eastern Bloc territories as Eastern European states, thus including Poland. However, critics of this categorization consider it outdated and detrimental to the reputation of the country.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{authoritative}} medical websites, such as PubMed and MedlinePlus, provide consumers {{with the most}} up-to-date health information. However, non-English speakers often encounter not only language barriers (from other languages to English) but also terminology barriers (from laypersons’ terms to professional medical terms) when retrieving information from these websites. Our previous work addresses language barriers by developing a <b>multilingual</b> medical <b>thesaurus,</b> Chinese-English MeSH, while this study presents an approach to overcome terminology barriers based on Web resources. Two techniques were utilized in our approach: monolingual concept mapping using approximate string matching and crosslingual concept mapping using Web resources.

50|$|The European Thesaurus on International Relations and Area Studies (abbreviated: European <b>Thesaurus)</b> is a <b>multilingual,</b> {{interdisciplinary}} <b>thesaurus</b> {{covering the}} subject fields of International Relations and Area Studies. The European Thesaurus consists of about 8.200 descriptors organised in 24 subdomains. To enhance {{the access to}} the thesaurus’ controlled vocabulary the descriptors are arranged both alphabetically as well as systematically. The semantic relationships (equivalence, hierarchy, association) between all individual descriptors have been established. The European Thesaurus {{is intended to be}} used primarily in bibliographic databases for indexing and retrieval of professional literature from the relevant domains. The European Thesaurus can, in addition, even serve as a terminological reference work and/or as a translation tool in international affairs matters.|$|R
30|$|Structured {{resources}} in the RDF format (RDF Working Group 2004) managed by a triple store which include a SPARQL (2008) endpoint are necessary for an efficient mashup of different entities. RDF data reflect the use of entities, such as classes or properties {{of one or more}} appropriate ontologies. For enhanced interoperability, it is best to adopt existing ontologies when available. Domain ontologies such as the Semantic Web for Earth and Environmental Terminology SWEET ontology 60 from NASA or the Semantic Sensor Net SSN ontology 61 from W 3 C 62 are good starting points for the creation of an ontology for a particular domain. There are also terminological ontologies containing controlled vocabularies for the tagging and indexing of resources of the geo and space science domain, such as GEMET (General <b>Multilingual</b> Environmental <b>Thesaurus</b> GEMET 2012).|$|R

40|$|Controlled vocabularies, {{such as the}} <b>multilingual</b> {{agricultural}} <b>thesaurus</b> AGROVOC, are the facilitators of semantic {{services on}} the Internet, since they can provide the baseline for connecting distributed resources. The more resources in a particular domain are described using a certain controlled vocabulary, the more accessible and interoperable they will be. Providers of controlled vocabularies traditionally distribute their complete databases upon request to system developers in order to incorporate them into information systems. This process is cumbersome, and creates duplication of work, since common vocabulary and terminology services (like a query for a related term) have to be redone each time at the local application level. With web services {{it is now possible}} to expose such common vocabulary services openly on the Internet, thus avoiding laborious local duplication and ultimately encouraging a wider audience to use these services...|$|R
40|$|Thesauri {{have been}} proven means to {{identify}} documents in libraries for centuries. In this paper, we show how this approach can be combined with most recent Internet technologies. The Java-based general thesaurus browser GenThes is able to handle several heterogeneous, multilingual thesauri. With the General European <b>Multilingual</b> Environmental <b>Thesaurus</b> (GEMET), GenThes is currently being used with several environmental catalogue systems. Feedback from users reveal that this approach greatly facilitates search and retrieval as compared to free-text only search. Performance which is crucial in Web applications as well has been improved by reducing the transfer volume of data and code. The software architecture of GenThes supports easy configuration and adaption to the individual needs of different systems that it is connected to. Ongoing work as well addresses to use GenThes as a query expansion module for multilingual search in distributed document collections...|$|R
