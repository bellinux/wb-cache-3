5|$|However, the <b>most</b> <b>obvious</b> {{deficiency}} of the Roman army remained its shortage of cavalry, especially heavy cavalry. As Rome's borders expanded and its adversaries changed from largely infantry-based to largely cavalry-based troops, the infantry-based Roman army began to find itself at a tactical disadvantage, {{particularly in the}} East.|$|E
5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>obvious</b> {{difference}} between the brains of mammals and other vertebrates {{is in terms of}} size. On average, a mammal has a brain roughly twice as large as that of a bird of the same body size, and ten times as large as that of a reptile of the same body size.|$|E
5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>obvious</b> technology, the centrifuge, failed, but {{electromagnetic}} separation, gaseous diffusion, {{and thermal}} diffusion technologies were all successful {{and contributed to}} the project. In February 1943, Groves {{came up with the idea}} of using the output of some plants as the input for others.|$|E
50|$|Collars and lapels {{are perhaps}} the <b>most</b> {{visually}} <b>obvious</b> embellishments. They frame the face, neck and shoulders, and complement the neckline and armhole lines.|$|R

50|$|Run-ins {{with the}} Uruguay head coach Jorge Fossati have {{restricted}} his playing {{time for the}} national team, <b>most</b> strikingly <b>obvious</b> was his omission from the last stage of 2006 World Cup qualification. Uruguay failed {{to qualify for the}} 2006 World Cup.|$|R
5|$|The nelicourvi weaver can be {{distinguished}} from the related sakalava weaver, which has streaked plumage. The somewhat related forest fody and Madagascar fody mostly have streaked upperparts and scarlet as the <b>most</b> <b>obvious</b> colour.|$|E
5|$|Boccaccio {{introduces}} {{a number of}} features {{of the story that}} were to be taken up by Chaucer. <b>Most</b> <b>obvious</b> is that Troilus' love is now called Criseida or Cressida. An innovation in the narrative is the introduction of the go-between Pandarus. Troilus is characterised as a young man who expresses whatever moods he has strongly, weeping when his love is unsuccessful, generous when it is.|$|E
5|$|In autumn and winter, the {{extensive}} flood plain of the Shannon Callows supports {{a large number}} of waders, swans, wildfowl and other bird life. The <b>most</b> <b>obvious</b> of all Shannon birds is the mute swan. Also seen are the coot, moorhen and little grebe (or dabchick). The kingfisher is widespread as are the meadow pipit and pied wagtail. The area has one of the largest concentrations of breeding waders in Ireland including lapwing, redshank, sandpiper and godwit.|$|E
5|$|The <b>most</b> {{significant}} and <b>obvious</b> {{difference is the}} constant flicker of the ghosts, which is frequently cited as the game's primary flaw.|$|R
50|$|This film {{is famous}} (or infamous) {{for one of}} the <b>most</b> blatantly <b>obvious</b> {{continuity}} errors in a western, when John Wayne fires 13 shots from an un-reloaded six-shooter during the final gun battle. Ironically, Wayne, in one of his earliest Hollywood jobs, years before, had been a continuity checker for films.|$|R

5|$|Sawtooth National Forest has {{a history}} of alpine {{glaciation}} that is <b>most</b> <b>obvious</b> in the Sawtooth Mountains, and while no surface glaciers exist today, perennial snow fields and rock glaciers remain, usually on north or east facing slopes. There have been 202 perennial snow fields mapped in the Sawtooth Mountains, and while none have been mapped elsewhere on the forest, some may still exist in the Boulder, Pioneer, and White Cloud Mountains.|$|E
5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>obvious</b> {{benefit of}} {{adopting}} {{a single currency}} is to remove the cost of exchanging currency, theoretically allowing businesses and individuals to consummate previously unprofitable trades. For consumers, banks in the eurozone must charge the same for intra-member cross-border transactions as purely domestic transactions for electronic payments (e.g., credit cards, debit cards and cash machine withdrawals).|$|E
5|$|The <b>most</b> <b>obvious</b> {{manifestation of}} these links {{can be seen}} in the annual St. Patrick's Day Festival. The festival is {{sponsored}} by the Irish Government and Guinness. The festival runs for over a fortnight and includes lectures, film shows, dance/Gaelic football competitions and music performances. The festival is the largest Irish celebration in Scotland.|$|E
50|$|The <b>most</b> {{common and}} <b>obvious</b> error is in daily {{rainfall}} events of >55mm (203mm rain gauge) where the Class A Evaporation pan will likely overflow.|$|R
50|$|There {{were up to}} 25 {{stations}} {{along the}} Nelson Section, though Gowanbridge was never used in revenue service. The shortest-lived station was Kawatiri at only 5 years and 21 days. All stations handled passenger traffic until passenger services were cancelled in 1954, and most also handled freight traffic. All are now closed, and of <b>most,</b> no <b>obvious</b> signs remain.|$|R
50|$|Sticky mouse is a murine mutant {{possessing}} a defective alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) and therefore used in investigational studies into mechanisms of neuronal degeneration. Its <b>most</b> immediately <b>obvious</b> symptom is a sticky secretion on the mouse's fur (thus the name); however, it {{is accompanied by}} lack of muscle control, ataxia, alopecia, loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, and eventually, death.|$|R
5|$|Whale {{morphology}} shows {{a number}} of examples of convergent evolution, the <b>most</b> <b>obvious</b> being the streamlined fish-like body shape. Other examples {{include the use of}} echolocation for hunting in low light conditions— which is the same hearing adaptation used by bats— and, in the rorqual whales, jaw adaptations, similar to those found in pelicans, that enable engulfment feeding.|$|E
5|$|While the {{traprock}} cliffs {{remain the}} <b>most</b> <b>obvious</b> {{evidence of the}} prehistoric geologic processes of the Metacomet Ridge, the sedimentary rock of the ridge and surrounding terrain has produced equally significant evidence of prehistoric life {{in the form of}} Triassic and Jurassic fossils; in particular, dinosaur tracks. At a state park in Rocky Hill, Connecticut, more than 2,000 well preserved early Jurassic prints have been excavated. Other sites in Holyoke and Greenfield have likewise produced significant finds.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the nobility}} {{there were many}} educated and cultured women, of which Queen Mary is the <b>most</b> <b>obvious</b> example. By the early eighteenth century their {{education}} was expected to include basic literacy and numeracy, musical instruments (including lute, viol and keyboard), needlework, cookery and household management, while polite accomplishments and piety were also emphasised. From the seventeenth century they were some notable aristocratic female writers. The first book written by a woman and published in Scotland was Elizabeth Melville's Ane Godlie Dreame in 1603. Later major figures included Lady Elizabeth Wardlaw (1627–1727) and Lady Grizel Baillie (1645–1746). There are 50 autobiographies extant from the late seventeenth to the early eighteenth century, of which 16 were written by women, {{all of which are}} largely religious in content.|$|E
5000|$|Child {{safeguarding}} follows {{directly from}} these principles. Safeguarding means taking the necessary protective measures for the child's safe consumption of any product, stair-gates, seatbelts, protective footwear, glasses, basic hygiene, etc. The list is both endless and, to the <b>most</b> part, <b>obvious</b> common sense. Failure by the responsible person is an offence of child cruelty {{on the grounds}} of failing to protect the child in circumstances consistent with the provision of safe and effective care [...]|$|R
5000|$|The <b>most</b> {{visually}} <b>obvious</b> of Reviseds changes was {{the elimination}} of the Mono/Poly/Continuous qualifiers to artifacts. With the advent of the games first tap symbol (a [...] "T" [...] turned forty-five degrees clockwise in a light gray circle), the qualifiers used to differentiate when and how often an artifact could be used were no longer needed. Artifacts that were previously classified as Mono artifacts were given the new tap symbol, while Poly and Continuous artifacts were simply re-templated without the tap symbol.|$|R
60|$|Aristocracy {{is not an}} institution: {{aristocracy}} is a sin; {{generally a}} very venial one. It is merely the drift or slide of men {{into a sort of}} natural pomposity and praise of the powerful, which is the <b>most</b> easy and <b>obvious</b> affair in the world.|$|R
5|$|At times Shelley {{had trouble}} finding {{sufficient}} research materials {{and had to}} make do with fewer resources than she would have liked, particularly for the Spanish and Portuguese Lives. She wrote in a style that combined secondary sources, memoir, anecdote, and her own opinions. Her political views are <b>most</b> <b>obvious</b> in the Italian Lives, where she supports the Italian independence movement and promotes republicanism; in the French Lives she portrays women sympathetically, explaining their political and social restrictions and arguing that women can be productive members of society if given the proper educational and social opportunities.|$|E
5|$|Each module {{was fitted}} with {{external}} components {{specific to the}} experiments that were carried out within that module, the <b>most</b> <b>obvious</b> being the Travers antenna mounted to Priroda. This synthetic aperture radar consisted of a large dish-like framework mounted outside the module, with associated equipment within, used for Earth observations experiments, as was {{most of the other}} equipment on Priroda, including various radiometers and scan platforms. Kvant-2 also featured several scan platforms and was fitted with a mounting bracket to which the cosmonaut manoeuvring unit, or Ikar, was mated. This backpack was designed to assist cosmonauts in moving around the station and the planned Buran {{in a manner similar to}} the US Manned Maneuvering Unit, but it was only used once, during EO-5.|$|E
5|$|El Toro {{has several}} {{similarities}} to Viper, the coaster that it replaced. The <b>most</b> <b>obvious</b> similarity is that El Toro uses Viper's station, {{the only part}} of Viper that was not torn down. The station previously held two Viper trains at once, with a loading platform in the front and an unloading platform in the rear. The ramp that was previously Viper's main exit is now used only for wheelchair access, as El Toro has a new exit {{on the other side of}} the station. During El Toro's construction, the station was gutted and an entirely new platform built. Like El Toro, Viper turned left out of the station before the lift hill and turned left at the top of the lift before the first drop.|$|E

5000|$|While The Guardian {{called the}} {{programme}} [...] "fascinating", but criticised it by saying [...] "Secular societies, of course, {{can be very}} brutal, but they weren't actually killing {{in the name of}} their non-belief, were they?", the Express criticised Liddle, claiming he was arguing [...] "the <b>most</b> blindingly <b>obvious</b> things anyone could possibly say" [...] and the Times objected to the brevity of his arguments, stating that, while some opponents of religion made a poor impression, [...] "a more sustained debate would have made this a more rigorously argumentative programme".|$|R
5|$|GameSpot and GameSpy {{called the}} dialog sharply written, with many memorable lines. Eurogamer {{noted that the}} characters' {{frequent}} use of vulgar language worked; written as real people, such language fit their character rather than giving the game an adult veneer. The website appreciated the breadth of dialog options, allowing the player greater control of how to play their character. PC Zone opined that the quantity of well-written dialog did not guarantee quality; many player choices seemed to have little effect on a conversation's outcome, and the best response was often the <b>most</b> <b>obvious.</b> The voice acting was repeatedly praised for the actors' quality {{and the amount of}} voice work, due to the many dialog options.|$|E
5|$|Georgia's defense {{managed a}} strong {{performance}} statistically and in real terms. The <b>most</b> <b>obvious</b> {{examples of this}} were the threeinterceptions and one forced fumble {{that proved to be}} the turning point in the game. Two of the interceptions were caught by linebacker Tony Taylor, who also had ninetackles, two for a loss of yards. The tackles tied him with Paul Oliver, who also had nine. The third interception came from Kelin Johnson, while the fumble was forced by Charles Johnson. Johnson had an active day as well. In addition to the forced fumble, he recorded fourtackles, twosacks, and a passbreak-up.|$|E
5|$|Her {{interest}} in {{education has been}} one of her <b>most</b> <b>obvious</b> surviving charitable legacies. She founded schools in all the villages surrounding the Roseberys' estates. The Mentmore estate alone was serviced by three schools founded by her at Wingrave, Cheddington and Mentmore itself. Not only were the children educated at her expense by trained teachers, each was also provided with seasonal gifts of new clothes. Cheddington School remains in its original building with her cypher on its walls, while Wingrave School, which opened in 1877, survives in new premises.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{parentheses}} is Lisp's <b>most</b> immediately <b>obvious</b> {{difference from}} other programming language families. As a result, students have long given Lisp nicknames such as Lost In Stupid Parentheses, or Lots of Irritating Superfluous Parentheses. However, the S-expression syntax is {{also responsible for}} much of Lisp's power: the syntax is extremely regular, which facilitates manipulation by computer. However, the syntax of Lisp {{is not limited to}} traditional parentheses notation. It can be extended to include alternative notations. For example, XMLisp is a Common Lisp extension that employs the metaobject protocol to integrate S-expressions with the Extensible Markup Language (XML).|$|R
5000|$|After {{a landing}} {{accident}} {{in which the}} retractable landing gear failed to extend, the P.111 was modified during its repairs to improve the flight characteristics, and was re-designated the P.111A. Four [...] "petal" [...] airbrakes {{were added to the}} fuselage to lower landing speeds and the undercarriage doors were changed to reduce the trim change. A long nose probe carrying a pitot head was added. The <b>most</b> immediately <b>obvious</b> change was the new bright yellow overall paint scheme, the P.111 having been unpainted or silver coloured. The P.111A soon gained the nickname of the [...] "Yellow Peril".|$|R
50|$|Standard racing flags {{are used}} by corner workers {{stationed}} around the track to communicate with drivers. The black flag is used liberally throughout the race to mandate an immediate pit stop for concerns with the driving or with the car. Driving infractions range from any contact with another vehicle or fixed barrier and overly aggressive driving to spinning or driving two wheels off of the track. Car problems that typically result in black flags are, <b>most</b> frequently, <b>obvious</b> safety problems such as any fluid leak, parts hanging off the car, or inoperative lights. Drivers must report to the penalty box immediately after being shown a black flag.|$|R
