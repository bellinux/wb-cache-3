50|$|Payton {{worked in}} the family barber shop until April 1899, {{when he decided to}} make more of himself, and left for New York City, against the wishes of both parents. There, he worked as a {{department}} store picture and weighing <b>machine</b> <b>attendant</b> at $6 per week, a barber at $5-6 per week, and finally as a porter in a real estate office at $8 per week. While working as a porter, he got the idea of going into the real estate business on his own.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a system for}} the representation, processing and provision of technological knowledge for laser beam processing that makes it possible, in addition to tabular test records and physico-mathematical models, {{to take advantage of}} company specific experiences. Due to the complexity of the laser beam working process and the dificulty in selecting the optimum setting parameters the engineering competence of the operations scheduling personnel and <b>machine</b> <b>attendants</b> is of particular importance. The acquisition and preparation of technological knowledge is a substantial factor for the conservation of company know-how...|$|R
50|$|OS/2 {{was widely}} used in Brazilian banks. Banco do Brasil had a peak 10,000 {{machines}} running OS/2 Warp in the 1990s. OS/2 was used in automated teller machines until 2006. The workstations and automated teller <b>machines</b> and <b>attendant</b> computers have been migrated to Linux.|$|R
5000|$|Appearing {{before the}} U.S. Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management during the 1950s, Prio pleaded the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution at least 90 times. [...] During the hearings, Prio {{claimed to be}} {{strictly}} a businessman with many legitimate businesses. These included cheese and canned whipped topping processors, currency exchanges, office buildings, hotels, motels, nightclubs, restaurants, finance companies, vending <b>machine</b> outfits, <b>attendant</b> services for clubs and hotels and interests in oil wells, real estate and Las Vegas casinos.|$|R
50|$|In North America, {{they are}} {{typically}} found at exclusive restaurants, night clubs, or bars. Robots {{are starting to}} be used in this role at the toilets in Japan in motorway service stations. Each <b>attendant</b> <b>machine</b> costs about 3.5 million yen, which is just about $45,000 USD.|$|R
50|$|While the Enigma {{machine was}} {{generally}} used by field units, the T52 was an online machine used by Luftwaffe and German Navy units, which could support the heavy <b>machine,</b> teletypewriter and <b>attendant</b> fixed circuits. It fulfilled a similar role to the Lorenz cipher {{machines in the}} German Army.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1880s, slot <b>machines</b> {{required}} an <b>attendant</b> {{to make a}} payout, usually tickets or tokens. Gustav Friedrich Wilhelm Schultze's [...] "Horseshoe Slot Machine" [...] of 1893 was the first machine to include an automatic payout mechanism. In 1895, Fey invented {{a modified version of}} the Horseshoe that paid out coins; this machine became incredibly popular.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of an {{elaborate}} washing <b>machine</b> and <b>attendant</b> handling lemons for the Exchange Products Company in Corona, California, ca. 1930. The company produces citric acid, oil of lemon, pectin, etc. The man faces the background in lightly-colored coveralls {{and a hat}} as he works lemons through the large washing machine in front of him. The lemons appear to enter the machine from a conveyer belt near the ceiling on the left, get hand washed by the attendant, fall {{on the right to}} a pool with three rollers below and flow towards the left. Water has spilled into the foreground where a stool stands to assist the <b>attendant</b> to the <b>machine...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{types of}} jobs {{available}} locally include assemblers, assembly coordinators, building and grounds technicians, custodians, cutting machine operators, electricians, fabrication operators, fixture technicians, journeyman toolmakers, machinists, maintenance mechanics, material handlers, metal fabricators, forklift drivers, paint coordinators, powder coating specialists, research-and-development technicians, quality control technicians, sewing and weaving <b>machine</b> operators, shipping/loading/receiving <b>attendants,</b> spinning and rewind machine operators, cutters, stamping operators, welders, and welding coordinators.|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of a carrier-based PWM two level voltage source inverter for a nine phase induction machine drive system is presented in this paper. Methods for generating zero-sequence signals during balanced and unbalanced condition are established. Simulation results for the analysis are presented. Two fault conditions involving the voltage source inverter and the nine-phase squirrel cage induction machine load are investigated. For the two fault scenarios considered, the effects on the performance characteristics of the induction machine load are highlighted. The simulation results obtained show that the two imbalance conditions considered result in substantial oscillations on the electromagnetic torque of the <b>machine</b> with <b>attendant</b> reduction in the torque rating. There is also large slip in the rotor speed. </span...|$|R
50|$|The occupations {{that were}} {{available}} to the village in 1881 {{can be described as}} rural with most, if not all, occupations centring around the life and needs of the village community. A large majority of men were involved in agriculture. The total number of 142 includes occupations such as farmers, graziers as well as accounting for their sons, grandsons, brothers and nephews involved in the occupation. Other agricultural occupations included farm bailiff's, agricultural labourers, farm servants, cottagers and agricultural <b>machine</b> proprietors and <b>attendants.</b>|$|R
40|$|Results are {{presented}} of the YF- 12 Lockalloy Ventral Fin Program which {{was carried out}} by Lockheed Aircraft Corporation - Advanced Development Projects for the joint NASA/USAF YF- 12 Project. The primary purpose of the program was to redesign and fabricate the ventral fin of the YF- 12 research airplane (to reduce flutter) using Lockalloy, and alloy of beryllium and aluminum, as a major structural material. A secondary purpose, was to make a material characterization study (thermodynamic properties, corrosion; fatigue tests, mechanical properties) of Lockalloy to validate the design of the ventral fin and expand the existing data base on this material. All significant information pertinent to the design and fabrication of the ventral fin is covered. Emphasis throughout is given to Lockalloy fabrication and <b>machining</b> techniques and <b>attendant</b> personnel safety precautions. Costs are also examined. Photographs of tested alloy specimens are shown along with the test equipment used...|$|R
40|$|Beating heart {{surgical}} {{methods have}} the potential to remove the need for the heart-lung <b>machine</b> and its <b>attendant</b> side effects, but must contend with the motion of the heart. Recent research in robotically-assisted surgery has produced a handheld, actuated in-strument that can track and compensate for heart motion; however, the reaction forces caused by the actuation mechanism make it dif-ficult for the surgeon to feel the heart during the operation, which can lead to unsafe tissue manipulation. This paper investigates an instrument design that negates reaction forces to the user by moving a counterweight out of phase with the moving mass of the actuator. The resulting instrument retains the tracking and motion compensa-tion abilities of the current instrument, but reduces reaction forces felt by the user by over 80 %. Subjects used the new instrument in an in vitro beating heart surgical contact task and performance was compared to the previously existing instrument. The new in-strument provided a 28 % increase in user force sensitivity and im-proved user reaction times by 51 %, indicating that the new instru-ment greatly enhances force perception in beating heart tasks...|$|R
