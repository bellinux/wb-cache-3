40|$|AbstractThis {{document}} {{describes how}} cutting force components influence {{the accuracy of}} processing complex profile surfaces of parts on CNC machines. It demonstrates how changing cutting zone geometrical parameters influences cutting force components. The article includes dependences for determining cutting force components. We propose a mathematical model to identify dynamic size-setting errors for 2 D machining of complex profile surfaces. We suggest a processing method to reduce error occurrence rate by controlling feed speed. This document includes a method of setting <b>feed</b> <b>motion</b> speed depending on the geometrical parameters of the machined surface. We recommend changing <b>feed</b> <b>motion</b> speed depending on machined surface pitch against the <b>feed</b> <b>motion</b> vector. We demonstrate that <b>feed</b> <b>motion</b> speed control allows to increase machining efficiency while assuring the set accuracy of {{the shape and dimensions}} of the components’ complex profile surfaces...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{reported in}} this paper aims at improving the dynamic performance of motion systems by analysing and mapping the non-uniformity of <b>feed</b> <b>motion</b> within the travel area. This paper (a) develops the real-time measuring of the <b>feed</b> <b>motions</b> through built-in position encoders, (b) considers the <b>feed</b> <b>motion</b> as a space-time random process, and (c) applies analysis in order to evaluate and map the dynamic performance. The dynamic performance as a 2 ̆ 01 cdynamic imprint 2 ̆ 01 d of the entire motion system {{is represented by the}} dynamic/statistic characteristics of <b>feed</b> <b>motion.</b> The transfer function of the motion system as a dynamic operator, which transforms prescribed motion into actual motion, is applied to model the dynamic performance. The results of the experimental investigations, analysis, and mapping of the dynamic performance indicate a wide range of industrial uses of the developed approach for certification, diagnostics, and tool path optimisation purposes to achieve highest accuracy for a particular motion system.

40|$|Metal {{cutting process}} {{is defined as}} a process which used to change shape of a metal made product by cutting. One kind of the cutting method which usually used is lathe process, where the process is {{maintained}} toward work substance of cylindrical shape. This observation is aimed to determine the effect or response graphic of independent variable which determined (spindle rotation speed, <b>feed</b> <b>motion,</b> cutting depth and material hardness level) toward dependent variable (cutting force and surface coarseness) of dynamometer designed and built by Machine Technique of UNDIP. The Dynamometer is a set of measurement tool which used to estimate of cutting force by principle to change its tension to be cutting force. The Dynamometer which working is using principle of electric. Commonly, the resistance change which used to measure the tension of motion measurement (LVDT pick-ups, moving plate capacitance pick-ups). To gain the response graphic of independent variable toward dependent variable in this observation is using two testing method, both testing with simple method and testing with Taguchi method. The estimation of simple testing method resulted response graphic of independent variable toward dependent variable, that is cutting force which the greatest value gained at level : spindle rotation by level 1 (200 rpm), cutting depth by level 3 (1. 5 mm), <b>feed</b> <b>motion</b> by level 3 (0. 009 mm/rev) and the specimen of level 3 (metal iron DIN 34 CrNiMo 6). By measuring with Taguchi method, the greatest value of cutting force yielded at level: spindle rotation by level 1 (200 rpm), cutting depth by level 3 (metal iron DIN 34 CrNiMo 6). Whereas the best value on surface coarseness is yielded at level: spindle rotation by level 1 (200 rpm), cutting depth with level 1 (0. 5 mm), <b>feed</b> <b>motion</b> with level 1 (0. 045 mm / rev) and specimen of level 3 (metal iron DIN 34 CrNiMo 6). From this observation can be concluded that the dynamometer which made and designed shows the cutting force will be greater if spindle rotation value is smaller, the value of cutting depth more bigger, feed rotation value more bigger and material coarseness level more higher. Meanwhile for the best value on surface coarseness is yielded if the spindle rotation is on low rotation, low <b>feed</b> <b>motion,</b> small cutting depth and iron specimen is DIN 34 CrNiMo 6.

The laser is a high-performance-, fiber-, disk-, carbon dioxide- or diode lasers. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method comprises obtaining a maximum absorption of the laser beam at a predetermined workpiece thickness, in which an inclination angle (phi c) of a cutting front by an adjustment of the geometry of the laser beam using beam formation and/or a movement of the focal points of the laser beam superimposed to the <b>feed</b> <b>motion</b> are changed, and superimposing an oscillating deflection of the laser beam to an uniform <b>feed</b> <b>motion.</b> The oscillating deflection is sinusoidally carried out in a feeding direction. The laser is a high-performance-, fiber-, disk-, carbon dioxide- or diode lasers. The movement of the focal points is carried out, so that the inclination angle of the cutting front is permanently changed and an incident angle of the laser beam (phi (IN)) is kept within an interval to Brewster-angle (phi (Br)). A path traverses between the two deflection points during the oscillating deflection of the focal point and {{is greater than the}} average diameter of the cross-section of the laser beam in the focal point. The oscillating deflection is performed with a frequency of 10 - 1000 Hz, is considerably performed a saw tooth function and a triangular function in the feeding direction and is carried out in an elliptical and figure-of-eight shaped manner. The laser beam is used with a rectangular or elliptical laser beam cross-section. The laser beam cross-section and/or the oscillation direction are adapted to the feeding direction. A cutting nozzle is adapted to the respective laser beam cross-section and/or the oscillating deflection of the laser beam, is used with an aperture opening for the laser beam with the rectangular or elliptical cross-section, and is considerably rotatable to the respective feeding direction.
