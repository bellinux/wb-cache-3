As the power of hydraulic system becomes higher, the flow and pressure of <b>water</b> <b>medium</b> relief valve are also higher, and the flow may reach 2000 L/min. However, there is no relevant test-bed which could provide instantaneous high-pressure and high-flow to support the experiment for high-flow relief valve; consequently, this impact test-bed for high-flow <b>water</b> <b>medium</b> relief valve is designed to satisfy fast loading demand. Through building model, simulation analysis, and construction of an impact test-bed of high-flow <b>water</b> <b>medium</b> relief valve, the dynamic performance of high-flow <b>water</b> <b>medium</b> relief valve is detected. The setting pressure of relief valve, the accumulator volume and the filling fluid pressure, and the damping of cartridge valve can be changed, and the dynamic performance of high-flow <b>water</b> <b>medium</b> relief valve under different impact loads is detected. The {{results show that the}} designed impact test-bed of high-flow <b>water</b> <b>medium</b> relief valve could provide required high-pressure and high-flow emulsion for the tested <b>water</b> <b>medium</b> relief valve, and it could control the strength of impact load, which is an energy saving, high efficiency, and low cost method...|$|R

40|$|Background: Electrocution {{can cause}} damages in tissue and body {{biochemical}} changes including heart muscles hypercontraction and elevation of creatine kinase–MB serum level. The {{purpose of this}} study is to prove effects of electrical current directly and through <b>medium</b> of <b>water</b> toward the amount of heart muscle fibre hypercontraction points and elevation of creatine kinase–MB serum level. Method: 54 wistar mice was chosen using simple random sampling. Samples then divided into 9 groups, i. e. group 1 – 4 had direct exposure to electrical current, 1 - 30 mA, 31 - 60 mA, 61 - 90 mA, 91 - 120 mA, respectively. Group 5 – 8 were exposed to electrical current through <b>medium</b> of <b>water,</b> 1 - 30 mA, 31 - 60 mA, 61 - 90 mA, 91 - 120 mA, respectively. Group 9 were not exposed to electrical current. After 7 days of adaptation, exposure of electrical current were performed then creatine kinase–MB were measured from sinus retroorbitalis using COBAS Integral 400 Plus-Roche and number of heart mucle fibre hypercontraction points were counted. Data analysis were performed using Spearman, Pearson correlation test and independent t test Result: Correlation value between the strength of exposure of electrical current and through <b>medium</b> of <b>water</b> with the amount of heart muscle fibre hypercontraction points were 0. 981 (p = 0. 000) and 0. 423 (p = 0. 020), while correlation number between the strength of exposure of electrical current and through <b>medium</b> of <b>water</b> with elevation of creatine kinase–MB serum level in wistar mice 0. 256 (p = 0. 172) and 0. 337 (p = 0. 068). Conclusion: There is a strong positive correlation between the strength of electrical current exposures with the amount of heart muscle hypercontraction points. There is no correlation between the strentgh of electrical current exposures with elevation of creatine kinase–MB level in wistar mice. There is a significant difference between the means of heart muscles hypercontraction points, but there is no significant creatin kinase-MB levels difference between direct electrical current exposure and the use of <b>water</b> as the <b>medium.</b> Keywords: electrical current, direct exposure, <b>medium</b> of <b>water,</b> heart muscle, hypercontraction, creatine kinase–M...|$|R
