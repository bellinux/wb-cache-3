40|$|International audienceThroughout the world, urban {{agriculture}} supplies fresh local {{vegetables to}} city populations. However, the increasing anthropogenic uses of metal-containing nanoparticles (NPs) such as CuO-NPs {{in urban areas}} may contaminate vegetables through foliar uptake. This study focused on the CuO-NP transfer processes in leafy edible vegetables (i. e., lettuce and cabbage) to assess their potential phytotoxicity. Vegetables were exposed via leaves for 5, 10, or 15 days to various concentrations of CuO-NPs (0, 10, or 250 mg per plant). Biomass and gas exchange values were determined {{in relation to the}} Cu uptake rate, localization, and Cu speciation within the plant tissues. High foliar Cu uptake occurred after exposure for 15 days for lettuce [3773 <b>mg</b> (<b>kg</b> of <b>dry</b> <b>weight)</b> - 1] and cabbage [4448 <b>mg</b> (<b>kg</b> of <b>dry</b> <b>weight)</b> - 1], along with (i) decreased plant weight, net photosynthesis level, and water content and (ii) necrotic Cu-rich areas near deformed stomata containing CuO-NPs observed by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis. Analysis of the CuO-NP transfer rate (7. 8 - 242 μg day- 1), translocation of Cu from leaves to roots and Cu speciation biotransformation in leaf tissues using electron paramagnetic resonance, suggests the involvement of plant Cu regulation processes. Finally, a potential health risk associated with consumption of vegetables contaminated with CuO-NPs was highlighted...|$|R

Exposures also included artifi-cial soils with different pH and OM contents {{as well as two}} natural soils used as controls. Exposures lasted for 2 (acute) and 12 weeks (chronic). Survival, reproduction and uptake of Pb in the mites were related to total, water-extractable and 0. 01 M CaCl 2 -extractable and porewater Pb concen-trations as well as soil characteristics. After both the acute and chronic exposures, adult survival was not significantly affected, while upon chronic exposure reproduction was remarkably reduced in the acidic forest soils with Pb con-centrations C 2153 mg/kg DW and pHCaCl 2 B 3. 5. P. pel-tifer juvenile numbers were significantly negatively and internal Pb concentrations in the mites were significantly positively related with total, extractable and porewater Pb concentrations.

The steps of the research were adsorption study in the laboratoryand followed by greenhouse trial. Cadmium adsorption study was using the rate of 0; 10; 30; 40; 50; 60; 70; 80; 90; and 100 ppm. The trial on response and plant uptake on cadmium used 2 kg soil pot- 1 then planted with shallot var. Bima for 2 months. The experiment utilized completely randomized design with six treatments and three replicates. The rates of Cd were 0; 25; 50; 100; 200; and 400 ppm Cd (Cd(NO 3) 2). The results showed that Inceptisols Brebes adsorption, maximum adsorption, andbuffering capacity are 14. 78 ml μg- 1; 879 μg g- 1 and 12, 987 ml μg- 1, respectively. The cadmium availability in the soil could be calculated by using the equation: Cdexchangeable = 0. 0532 (Cdapplied) – 1. 6757, r 2 = 0. 9686 (after treatment); Cdexchangeable = 0. 0671 (Cdapplied) + 0. 924, r 2 = 0. 9903 (after harvest). Application of 50 ppm Cd reduced shallot production up to 31 % significant with total uptake of 4. 57 ppm Cd. The Cd uptake increased significantly for treatment 25 ppm, Cd in shallot tuber(2. 36 <b>mg</b> Cd per <b>kg</b> <b>dry</b> <b>weight),</b> and at 200 ppm Cd in leaves (7. 16 mg kg- 1). The cadmium content in tuber at treatment 2 ppm Cd (2. 36 ppm Cd) exceeds critical value/permissible limit of vegetable for consumption...|$|R
40|$|Six {{bread wheat}} (Triticum aestivum) cultivars were grown under {{greenhouse}} conditions {{to study the}} role of increasing sulfur (S) application (0, 75 and 225 mg S kg- 1 soil) on dry matter production, shoot accumulation of selenium (Se) and development of Se toxicity symptoms. Plants were grown for 3 weeks in greenhouse under different Se (0, 0. 2, 1 and 5 mg Se kg- 1 soil) and S treatments which were applied in forms of sodium selenate and CaSO 4, respectively. As the genoypic differences found for sensitivity to Se toxicity and Se accumulation in shoot were relatively small, the results obtained are presented as average of all cultivars. At the nil Se, growing plants without S application did not affect dry matter production of plants compared to the plants treated with increasing S application, indicating that the S status of the soil used in the experiments {{was not limited to}} plant growth. Increasing Se application to soil from 0 to 5 mg kg- 1 significantly reduced plant dry matter production only at the low S applications. As average of all cultivars, decreasing Se supply from 5 to 0 mg kg- 1 increased plant dry matter production 11 -fold at the nil S treatment and only 1. 2 -fold at the a 225 mg kg- 1 S treatment. When plants were grown at the highest Se application without S, very severe toxicity symptoms, such as whitish and chlorotic patches, developed on the older leaves, mainly on the leaf basis. The leaf parts affected particularly by Se toxicity were whitish and had an albino appearance, lacking chlorophyll. Application of S prevented development of these leaf symptoms. Severity of Se toxicity symptoms on leaves were not directly related to the tissue concentration of Se and greatly affected from the concentrations of S in leaves. In Streated plants containing 398 <b>mg</b> Se per <b>kg</b> <b>dry</b> <b>weight</b> of leaves there was no or slight Se toxicity symptoms on leaves, while in plants with 213 <b>mg</b> Se per <b>kg</b> <b>dry</b> <b>weight</b> of leaves, but without S treatment, leaf symptoms were very severe, and there were marked decreases in dry matter production. This indicates importance of Se/S ratio in the tissue in development of Se injury in plants. Sulfur application caused marked decreases in Se concentration of plants. Increase in S application from 0 to 225 mg kg- 1 reduced Se concentration of plants from 28 to 3 mg kg- 1 at the Se rate of 0. 2 mg kg- 1, from 213 to 22 at the Se rate of 1 mg kg- 1 and from 1542 to 398 mg kg- 1 at the Se rate of 5 mg kg- 1. By contrast, increasing Se applications generally increased S concentration of plants, in most cases by 2 -fold. This increasing effect of Se on S accumulation was more pronounced in the case of total amount of Se per plant (S content). The results obtained indicate that the toxic effects of Se in wheat plants can be markedly minimized by increasing S applications. Sulfur is highly effective in repressing uptake of Se by roots. Sulfur is also affective to interfere with the toxic actions of Se at cellular level. Therefore, the critical toxic Se concentrations in leaves are much greater in plants containing lower than the plants with higher S concentrations. In contrast to the S-induced decrease in Se uptake, increasing Se application stimulated S uptake of plants. It seems very likely that there is a common uptake system (sulphate transporter?) mediating uptake and transport of Se and S in wheat. The stimulating effect of Se on accumulation of S in plants suggests that Se possibly interferes with the action of sulphate to repress the activity of sulphate transporter. vokMyynti MTT Tietopalvelut 31600 Jokioine...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were (i) to test different conditions of freezing, thawing, and grinding during sample preparation and (ii) to evaluate the possibility of using mid-infrared spectroscopy for analyzing the composition of sugars, organic acids, and polyphenols in apples. Seven commercial apple cultivars were chosen for their large variability in composition (total polyphenols from 406 to 1033 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 fresh weight). The different conditions of sample preparation affected only the phenolic compounds and not sugars or organic acids. The regression models of the mid-infrared spectra showed a good ability to estimate sugar and organic acid contents (R 2 ≥ 0. 96), except for citric acid. Good predictions were obtained for total phenolic, flavan- 3 -ols, and procyanidins (R 2 ≥ 0. 94) provided oxidation was avoided during sample preparation. A rapid and simple procedure was then proposed for phenolic compounds using sodium fluoride during sample homogenization at ambient temperature and freeze-drying before spectra acquisition. Mid-infrared (MIR) {{has been shown to be}} a suitable technique for high-throughput analysis of the major constituents in fruit juices, homogenates, and extracts. 1 − 7 These studies have been aimed to assay soluble solids content, titratable acidity, and the concentrations of individual sugars, organic acids, and total phenolic compounds. It would be highly beneficial if it could also be applied to the analysis of specific metabolites such as individual polyphenols. Indeed, the quantification of these compounds requires chemicals and solvents, equipment such as high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a diode array detector, good technical skill, and time. However, the development of high-throughput analyses has been hindered by the high reactivity of some molecules such as polyphenols. Hence, this study aimed at identifying the simplest and cheapest sample preparation for MIR application for poly-phenol quantification. The fruit chosen for this methodological optimization was apple, as it is among the most consumed fruits worldwide and indeed a good source of polyphenols in the French diet. 8 A regular consumption of apples provides a large amount of polyphenolic compounds such as flavan- 3 -ols (procyanidins and catechins), dihydrochalcones (phloridzin), hydroxycinnamic acids (chlorogenic acid and p-coumaroyl-quinic acid), flavonols (quercetin), and anthocyanins. A large variability exists according to the studied cultivars with, for example, a variation of total phenolic content between 523 and 2724 <b>mg</b> <b>kg</b> − 1 <b>dry</b> <b>weight</b> (DW) among 67 new and old apple varieties. ...|$|R
40|$|Pteris vittata L. (Chinese brake fern) is {{the first}} fern to be {{identified}} as a hyperaccumulator of the semimetal arsenic (As). The fern can accumulate more than 27000 <b>mg</b> As <b>kg</b> 1 <b>dry</b> <b>weight</b> in its fronds and for this reason it has been proposed to remove As from contaminated soil and water. Due to excessive agricultural and industrial practices, frequently As is released into the environment with other toxic metals, such as Cadmium (Cd). Both Cd and As are a threat for human health and ecosystems due to their accumulation and long permanence in the soil, in the food chain and locally in drinking water. The toxicity of Cd and As, for plants and animals, is due to their high reactivity with biological molecules and to their similarity with essential ions that they can replace altering cellular homeostasis. The plants easily adsorb these elements through their root apparatus. In plant cells, Cd and As cause oxidative stress reducing glutathione (GSH) level with severe consequences at all organism level. For this reason {{there is a need to}} find a natural system able to remove As and Cd efficiently. Lately, it was demonstrated that the fern is able to absorb and accumulate higher levels of Cd and As when exposed to both elements in comparison with when exposed to single pollutants. The interaction between Cd and As in the soil may have synergic or antagonistic effects on uptake and accumulation of the two ions in the plant organs. In the plant cells, Cd and As induce the synthesis of small peptides called phytochelatins (PCs), with a general structure (g-Glu-Cys) n-Gly (n = 2 11). These peptides are able to form complexes with metals and semimetals (such as Cd and As) in order to reduce their toxicity by sequestering them in the vacuole. The fern also produces PCs after As exposure. Today the response of Pteris vittata to Cd and As combined toxicity requires further investigation because it is unknown whether the fern uses the PCs as detoxification system when exposed to both pollutants and if other strategies are implemented. Thus,the aim of this research was to investigate if and how the fern is able to counteract metal and semimetal toxicity by analyzing the formation of phytochelatin complexes and the morphogenic responses when exposed simultaneously to Cd and As. The plant response was evaluated by analyzing Cd and As accumulation in roots and fronds, by measuring the plant biomass, by analyzing histologically the fronds and evaluating the formation of PC-As complexes. Furthermore the exudates extruded from the fronds were chemically analyzed to assess the contribution of the extrusion mechanism to the metals detoxification in the fern. The results show that plant morphology is strongly affected by Cd presence combined with As. In addition their simultaneous exposure increases the semimetal uptake while reduces the metal one. The exudates extruded from fronds are composed by both Cd and As. Furthermore in our results, the fern exposed to As and Cd together forms different As-PC complexes in the roots in comparison with the fronds. In conclusion, we can state that Pteris vittata activates strategies that helps it respond to the additive toxicity of Cd combined with As...|$|R

40|$|In {{isolated}} single skeletal myocytes undergoing long-term fatiguing contractions, caffeine (CAF) {{can result}} in nearly immediate restoration of generated tension to near-prefatigue levels by increasing Ca 2 + release via activation of sarcoplasmic reticulum release channels. This study tested whether arterial CAF infusion (> 5 mM) would cause a similar rapid restoration of tetanic isometric tension during contractions to fatigue in perfused canine hindlimb muscle in situ. Tetanic contractions were elicited by electrical stimulation (200 ms trains, 50 Hz, 1 contraction s- 1), and biopsies {{were taken from the}} muscle at rest and during contractions: (1) following the onset of fatigue (tension ∼ 60 % of initial value); and (2) following CAF administration. Resting muscle ATP, PCr and lactate contents were 25. 2 ± 0. 4, 76. 9 ± 3. 3 and 14. 4 ± 3. 3 mmol (<b>kg</b> <b>dry</b> <b>weight)</b> - 1, respectively. At fatigue, generated tetanic tension was 61. 1 ± 6. 9 % of initial contractions. There was a small but statistically significant recovery of tetanic tension (64. 9 ± 6. 6 % of initial value) with CAF infusion, after which the muscle showed incomplete relaxation. At fatigue, muscle ATP and PCr contents had fallen significantly (P < 0. 05) to 18. 1 ± 1. 1 and 18. 9 ± 2. 1 mmol (<b>kg</b> <b>dry</b> <b>weight)</b> - 1, respectively, and lactate content had increased significantly to 27. 7 ± 5. 4 mmol (<b>kg</b> <b>dry</b> <b>weight)</b> - 1.

40|$|The {{development}} of metal tolerance in soil bacterial communities exposed to different heavy metals was examined under laboratory conditions. An agricultural soil amended with different Zn concentrations was studied most intensively, and measurements were made over a 28 -month incubation period {{by means of}} the thymidine incorporation technique. Tolerance levels were not affected by metal concentrations lower than 2 mmol of Zn <b>kg</b> (<b>dry</b> <b>weight)</b> of soil(sup- 1), but above this value, the level of Zn tolerance increased exponentially with the logarithm of the soil Zn concentration. An increased metal tolerance was detected after only 2 days of Zn exposure. Thereafter, stable tolerance values were observed at different sampling times for bacterial communities exposed to up to 8 mmol of Zn <b>kg</b> (<b>dry</b> <b>weight)</b> (sup- 1), indicating no changes in tolerance with time. The tolerance of bacterial communities exposed to 32 mmol of Zn <b>kg</b> (<b>dry</b> <b>weight)</b> (sup- 1) increased rapidly within the second week of incubation, but then the values remained unchanged {{until the end of the}} experiment. Bacterial communities from soil contaminated with 16 mmol of Zn <b>kg</b> (<b>dry</b> <b>weight)</b> (sup- 1) showed an increase of the same magnitude, but the increase started later, after 4 months of incubation, and took place for a much longer period (more than 1 year). Cd, Cu, and Ni addition also resulted in metal-tolerant communities, and the level of tolerance increased with prolonged incubations of the soils. The bacterial community at the end of the incubation period also exhibited a lower pH optimum and an increased tolerance to low osmotic potential. The results suggest that the increase in metal tolerance of the community after adding metals can be attributed to an immediate effect due to the death of sensitive species and a later effect due to different competitive abilities and adaptation of surviving bacteria...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{evaluate}} non-invasively with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H-MRS) changes in the concentrations of intracellular (IT) and extracellular (between muscle fibres) triglycerides (ET) in skeletal muscles of trained males (age range: 24 – 38 years) during two standard exercise protocols of alternating velocities. Protocol 1 consisted of locomotion in a shuttle manner between two lines 30 m apart at four different velocities (1, 2, 3 and 4 m s− 1) which were alternated every minute in a standard routine for 90 min, whereas Protocol 2 included locomotion between two lines 20 m apart at only three velocities (2, 2. 7 and 4 m s− 1) until volitional exhaustion. The heart rate during both protocols fluctuated between 140 and 200 beats min− 1. Using pre-exercise muscle water to quantify individual total creatine (TCr) that was utilized as an internal standard and assuming that TCr does not change during exercise, subjects’ mean IT and ET concentrations in soleus (Sol) muscle before Protocol 1 (n = 8) were 45. 8 ± 4. 8 mmol (<b>kg</b> <b>dry</b> <b>weight)</b> − 1 (mean ± s. e. m.) and 93. 1 ± 14. 1 mmol (<b>kg</b> <b>dry</b> <b>weight)</b> − 1, respectively. After the exercise, the concentrations of IT and ET were not significantly different from the values at rest. Before Protocol 2 (n = 4), IT concentrations in Sol, gastrocnemius (Gast) and tibialis (Tib) muscles were 46. 4 ± 13. 6, 35. 0 ± 12. 1 and 23. 1 ± 4. 8 mmol (<b>kg</b> <b>dry</b> <b>weight)</b> − 1, respectively, and were not affected by the exhaustive exercise. The ET concentrations in Sol, Gast and Tib were 136. 4 ± 38. 1, 175. 3 ± 86. 5 and 79. 3 ± 20. 0 mmol (<b>kg</b> <b>dry</b> <b>weight)</b> − 1, respectively, and they did not change significantly after exhaustion. The study showed that levels of IT and ET were not affected by alternating intensity exercise to fatigue. This suggests that IT and ET in human Sol, Gast and Tib muscles do not contribute significantly to the energy turnover during this type of exercise. Energy for this type of muscle contraction may arise primarily from muscle phosphocreatine (PCr) and glycogen breakdown, circulating glucose and fatty acids from triglycerides other than those encountered within and between muscle cells...|$|R
