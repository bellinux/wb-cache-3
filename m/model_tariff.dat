30|$|In {{contrast}} to the stated literature, we derive a consumer surplus model with the intention to explain the theoretically optimal tariff choice. Within this <b>model,</b> <b>tariff</b> choice relies on the preferences of a representative consumer, and not on an exogenous demand or observed choice. This modeling approach has the distinct advantage that the demand for tariff usage is derived endogenously and depends also on the chosen tariff and the pricing structure. In other words, given the same preferences, a consumer will exert a different consumption pattern under a cost cap tariff than under a pay-per-use or flat rate plan, because prices are different. This endogenous change in demand {{should be taken into}} account when choosing a tariff.|$|E

The Bank's structural adjustment and trade reform programs have often recommended abolition of quantitative import restrictions and increased uniformity in tariffs. This report is a formal analysis of some political economy arguments for uniform tariffs. The authors present three models in which unifrom tariff rules may be adopted {{as a way}} of minimizing the welfare costs of endogenously determined tariffs. In the first two <b>models,</b> <b>tariffs</b> are demand determined : the government is essentially unable to resist the lobbying pressure.

40|$|This paper uses an applied general equilbrium {{model to}} {{decompose}} {{the effects of}} changes in trade and technology-related variables on wages of skilled and unskilled labor between 1982 and 1996 in the United States. The results indicate that trade-related variables (tariff cuts, improvement {{in the terms of}} trade, and the increase in the trade deficit) had little impact on the widening wage gap. Also, changes in total factor productivity had a small effect on relative wages. The major factor behind the rise in the skilled wage relative to the unskilled wage was differential rates of growth in skill-biased technical change across sectors. The paper also highlights the role that nontraded goods play in explaining the wage gap. Finally, the paper presents estimates of the effect of trade on wages by calculating what wage rates would be under autarky. The results show that expanding trade could actually reduce wage inequality, rather than increase it. The welfare costs to the U. S economy of moving to autarky (using 1996 as a base) are about 6 percent of GDP.

40|$|Tariffs {{and other}} policy distortions {{typically}} lower real national income relative {{to what it}} {{otherwise would have been}} for any given rate of factor accumulation. Even while lowering real income, however, policy distortions may raise an economy''s real measured growth rate and so, somewhat deceivingly, give the impression that national welfare has benefited from things like tariff protection. This would be an incorrect conclusion. This paper discusses the issue of how protection can affect the rate of growth for a small, open economy. As shown by Johnson (1970), in the presence of exogenously given factor accumulation, tariffs either raise or lower an economy''s growth rate (measured by the change in the value of output at world prices), relative to the no-distortion growth rate. We also discuss the relevance of this result for tariff uniformity, "tariff jumping" foreign direct investment, and the empirical literature on trade and growth. Finally we use a numerical simulation model of Egypt to assess whether the costs of its tax distortions have increased or declined over time.

40|$|Indonesia has {{achieved}} a rapid economic growth {{over the last two}} and a half decades. Trade liberalization implemented under sound macroeconomic policies among various factors is one of the essential elements which has enabled Indonesia to have succeeded in spectacular economic growth. In the wake of the dynamic movement of global trade liberalization in recent years, this study attempted to analyze the economic impacts of trade liberalization in the form of tariff reforms on Indonesia 2 ̆ 7 s regional economy. In addition, in view of the reduced government role in the process of economic development, this study also focuses on the analysis of the shift of the fiscal allocation in public investment. The analytical methodology is the use of a two-region interregional computable general equilibrium model. The model is a comparative static in nature and focuses on the real side of the economy. The effects of tariff reforms are analyzed in two analytical frameworks, the base model and the variant model, while the experiments in public investment are simulated in the base model. In the base <b>model,</b> <b>tariff</b> reforms lead to higher economic growth of the nation by increasing the overall level of technological efficiency. The tariff reforms generate greater economic gain in Java relative to the Outer Islands. There exists a tradeoff between economic growth and the degree of household income inequality. In the variant model, the impacts of tariff reforms always benefit Java in a considerable degree at a huge cost to the Outer Islands due to the massive interregional labor migration. On public investment, given the zero-sum net allocation, Java has a comparative advantage relative to the Outer Islands in terms of overall productivity and economic efficiency. It is found that the national economy entirely relies on Java 2 ̆ 7 s economic performance. Out of the three investment categories, economic infrastructure is the most efficient, and general services the least in both regions. However, both tariff reforms and the shift of fiscal allocation in public investment cannot necessarily achieve the country 2 ̆ 7 s most essential dual objectives simultaneously: economic growth and equity. ...|$|E

40|$|The Philippines {{undergoes}} a tariff reform program. After {{more than a}} decade of implementation, significant achievements have been attained in terms of changes in the tariff structure. For example, quantitative restrictions on important commodities have been tariffied. The tariff structure has been simplified from a multi-layered one into a structure with fewer tariff rates. Furthermore, tariff rates have been substantially reduced. The objective of the paper is to analyze the effects of the tariff reform program using a computable general equilibrium model calibrated using Philippine data. The primary focus is on the change in the tariff structure and its impact on efficiency, resource movements, income distribution, and welfare. economic/development <b>modelling,</b> <b>tariff...</b>|$|R

As such, {{there will be an}} evaluation of which factors has the strongest impact on the energy cost, and the probable course of development of these factors. The impact and consequences of a future <b>tariff</b> <b>model</b> based on extracted power on PV systems are evaluated. Lastly, the effects of local production and storage on the tariff are examined. A development towards extraction of power as the main contributor towards further investment in the power supply infrastructure makes a <b>tariff</b> <b>model</b> based on extracted power likely in the near future. This remodeling away from tariffs based on average energy consumption will affect households who have adjusted to profits from low energy consumption. Based on theoretical principals for <b>tariff</b> <b>modeling,</b> a <b>tariff</b> <b>model</b> was created to examine these elements. The DeVID project was the source of some inspiration in constructing the model used in this thesis. Parts of this thesis are a continuation of previous work in the field. The expected production of photovoltaic systems is based on a paper by Mulitconsult. Reports on the development of PV system prices as well as the effects of <b>tariff</b> <b>models</b> based on extracted power in other countries were used to frame the model used in this thesis. The works mentioned are presented in a chapter of their own. The conclusion of this thesis is that the prices for PV systems are in rapid decline. Within a few years, the market in Norway is expected to increase significantly. The mechanisms in the created <b>tariff</b> <b>model</b> penalizes high power extraction and rewards leveled consumption. This may have negative and unwanted effects on households whom have adjusted to low average consumption or are covering some of their consumption by producing energy themselves.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis {{is to create an}} easily understood <b>tariff</b> <b>model</b> suitable for electric vehicle (EV) charging stations connected to solar panels and the power grid, i. e. the sun-based <b>model.</b> The <b>tariff</b> <b>model</b> should give incentives to maximise the self-consumption of the station, i. e. to increase the direct use of the photovoltaic (PV) produced energy. This is done through encouraging the customer to charge at daytime and with low power output. The presented results show how different types of EVs are affected with the suggested sun-based model, i. e. what their energy price and their price per 10 km becomes. The sensitivity analysis consists of a change in the installed PV capacity. The results show that the proposed model provides advantages for solar-charging, since the best price is offered to the customers who charge in the desired manner. The price is unaffected with the different solar panel sizes, but the profits of the station owners increase with the size. One particular challenge noticed in the model however is that the profit for the station owner increases with lower degrees of self-consumption, which needs to be rectified in future studies prior real-life implementation...|$|R

We propose and estimate a Bayesian learning <b>model</b> of <b>tariff</b> and usage choice that explains this “flat-rate bias ” without relying on behavioral misjudgments or tariff-specific preferences. For new products, consumers are uncertain about both their utility relative to the population mean and the mean itself. We show that this latter uncertainty inflates prior variances, which leads consumers to weight their private signals more heavily when updating beliefs. Posteriors are unbiased across products. For a given product, however, the unknown mean yields a “winner’s curse”: consumers with high posteriors tend to overestimate their utility. These consumers choose fixed-rate tariffs and lower their usage as they correct their beliefs. The flat-rate bias arises when switching costs deter them from changing tariffs.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to devise a simple but {{practical}} model to assist decision makers in evaluating the tariff stability of concession schemes. Design/methodology/approach – To develop such a model necessitates the identification of parameters that could contribute to an increase or decline in investment return. With that a Monte‐Carlo‐based simulation model is devised to determine the probability that the tariff regime remains unchanged even when the identified risks do occur at the operational stage. Sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the most influential factors to investment return and tariff stability. Findings – The results of the scenario indicate that the internal rate of return could be profoundly influenced by the risk factors which reaffirm the needs for a more comprehensive <b>model</b> for <b>tariff</b> stability evaluation. Research limitations/implications – Through the simulation <b>model,</b> a <b>tariff</b> stability indicator is derived and when integrated with the results of sensitivity analysis this could generate a weighted indicator for alternative tariff regimes for use in decision support systems. Practical implications – With the aid of simulation techniques, decision makers can predict the impact of a range of possible market conditions and/or levels of demand on the investment return and hence the stability of the tariff regime.
