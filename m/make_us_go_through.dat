We interact through platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and so on, which all have become ever-present through the technological advances in the fields of transportable electronics like mobile phones and laptops. This allows people to always be in contact with friends, coworkers and family, but the connection comes with a prize. Between all the chosen interactions comes the ever flowing updates which bathes our news feeds with pictures of travels, tales of adventure and more social events than we can ever manage to attend without breaking down. All these possibilities and experiences that our ‘acquaintances’ on these platforms <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> a selection process, though sometimes this process is not thorough enough. That is the point where the Fear of Missing Out, also known as FOMO, kicks in, and <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> enter a state of inadequacy. We want to experience all the possibilities, but acknowledges that the time is insufficient. FOMO, though most often used in studies of social media, can be used to explain the feeling of always needing to be available in one’s working place, which can create dysfunctionalities in the delicate relationship known as our work/life-balance. This project aims to investigate the uprising of FOMO in the work/life-balance context by utilizing the modern theories of affects. Affect theory was thought to uncover a possibility of understanding the influence of objects in how human feelings are products of external stimuli and not personal interpretation or interdiscursive negotiations. However, through our use and comparing study of the landscape of affect theories, primarily found in the collection, The Affect Theory Reader, with focus on the social constructionist perspective of Sara Ahmed, this paper ends at the conclusion, that the original theory, as presented by philosophers Baruch Spinoza and Gilles Deleuze, in all its originality isn’t applicable to common psychological study due to the monistic epistemological and ontological understandings that excludes the subject, and therefore makes it impossible to make any generalisations about human psychology...|$|R
