40|$|Laser {{hardening}} is a laser assisted process {{devoted to}} the surface hardening of the mechanical components. This process is highly suitable for medium carbon steels with carbon content comprised between 0. 2 - 0. 6 % or for low alloy steels which are usually surface hardened during their manufacturing process. Laser hardening technology is gaining a great industrial interest {{in the last years}} in fact, the possibility of integrating the heating source directly on the production line, together with the absence of the quenching medium, meets the production needs of modern industries. Laser hardening optimization could be complex especially when tempering due to multiple passes effects must be considered. Many research studies have been proposed in the last years aimed at predicting the optimal laser process parameters such as beam power density, beam velocity and scanning strategies. Many Authors agree with the assumption that the whole austenite resulting from the heating is transformed into martensite during the quenching. This is a valid approximation for single pass but could be a rough hypothesis in multiple-passes when the cooling rate could be not so high. Moreover hysteresis phenomena, due to the severe heat cycle occurring in laser hardening, should be taken into account for pearlite to austenite and martensite to austenite transformations during heating and for <b>martensite</b> <b>tempering</b> during multiple passes. In this paper the crucial problems to be faced regarding laser surface hardening modeling are discussed with respect to current literature. In particular, partial austenitization of the pearlite is suggested as a solution of the hardness prediction of the profile depth. Then three transformation parameters are proposed in order {{to take into account the}} hysteresis phenomena in martensite and pearlite transformations into austenite and in <b>martensite</b> <b>tempering.</b> Finally several experimental examples are proposed in order to validate the mentioned assumptions...|$|E

40|$|The {{austenite}} formation under isochronal {{conditions in}} Nb microalloyed {{low carbon steel}} was studied by means of dilatometric analysis and the data was adjusted to the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) equation, for different heating rates and for three initial microstructures. It was shown that the kinetics of austenitization of a pearlite+ferrite structure is faster than that of <b>martensite</b> (<b>tempered</b> <b>martensite)</b> at a heating rate of 0. 1 ºC/s. For heating rates higher than 0. 1 ºC/s, the kinetics of austenitization of a martensite structure is faster than of pearlite+ferrite one. The K parameter of the JMAK equation increases with the heating rate for the three previous microstructures and it is greater for the initial microstructure composed of ferrite+pearlite. At lower heating rates, the formation of austenite in this steel is controlled by carbon diffusion, independently of the initial microstructure.

The microstructures were characterized using optical and scanning electron microscopy. Dilatometry analyses demonstrated that tempering behavior varied significantly from bainitic to martensitic microstructures. Retained austenite, which exists between bainitic ferrite sheaves, decomposes to lower bainite causing a remarkable volume increase. It was found that this decomposition finishes below 386 °C.

40|$|AISI 430 {{ferritic}} {{stainless steel}} (FSS) is {{the most widely used}} FSS alloy due to good resistance to stress corrosion cracking. Owing to the chemical composition range, AISI 430 alloys undergo a partial phase transformation of ferrite to austenite when subjected to hot rolling temperatures. Consequently, the alloys consist of ferrite and austenite during processing. The presence of austenite and ferrite influences the microstructure evolution and texture development during hot rolling and subsequent annealing heat treatments. Two AISI 430 FSS heats of varying austenite volume fraction were used in this study. The two AISI 430 FSS heats were deformed using the first three passes of the Steckel mill hot rolling process. Post deformation heat treatments namely: continuous phase transformation and <b>martensite</b> <b>tempering</b> heat treatments were performed after three successive simulated Steckel mill passes. Microstructure analyses were performed using light microscopy and Electron Backscattered Diffraction (EBSD). The microstructure analyses were performed in order to determine microstructure evolution and texture development during hot deformation and post deformation heat treatments. The difference in austenite volume fraction in the respective heats A and B has profound influence on the possibilities for microstructure and texture evolution. For the higher austenite volume fraction heat A, the post-deformation path for austenite decomposition can lead to two very different textures in the prior austenite regions. During continuous diffusional transformation from austenite to ferrite the final texture is influenced by expected variant selection as well as growth selection during the prolonged isothermal heat treatment. The result is relatively strong { 001 } texture and comparably very weak γ-fiber texture. In the case of the <b>martensite</b> <b>tempering</b> process the γ-fiber texture that is inherited from the austenite to martensite diffusionless transformation is maintained in the prior austenite regions.

40|$|In {{order to}} ensure a high {{passenger}} safety and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, dual-phase (DP) and martensitic steels (MS) are increasingly {{being used in the}} automotive industries. However, the main issue in the welding of steels containing a metastable martensite phase is softening, which occurs in the sub-critical heat affected zone (SCHAZ) and deteriorates joint integrity. This work attempts to understand the <b>martensite</b> <b>tempering</b> kinetics involved during high-speed laser beam welding where steels are exposed to the rapid heating and cooling cycles. Fiber laser welding was performed on DP steel and its dissimilar combination with high strength low alloy (HSLA) steel. Different zones that produced at heat affected zone (HAZ) were characterized with respect to microstructure, micro- and nano-hardness, and tensile testing. Microstructural characterization suggests that the as-received martensite phase decomposes in the SCHAZ and forms various shapes and sizes of carbides, which reduces the local microhardness of the steel and subsequently the sample fractured in this zone during tensile loading. In addition, the chemical composition and microstructure of DP steel {{plays an important role in}} the tempering reaction kinetics. The study conducted on the DP 780 steel composed of ferrite, martensite, and bainite microconstituents, exhibited increasing microhardness in the HAZ instead of softening. This phenomenon is referred to as “secondary hardening”. Rapid isothermal tempering conducted in a Gleeble simulator also indicated occurrence of secondary hardening at 500 °C, as confirmed by plotting the tempered microhardness against the Holloman-Jaffe parameter. The mechanism of secondary hardening in this kind of a steel was unveiled by advanced characterization techniques carried out using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) imaging. The experimental results suggested that the cementite (Fe 3 C) and TiC phases located in the bainite phase of DP 780 steel decomposed upon rapid tempering to form needle-shaped Mo 2 C and plate-shaped M 4 C 3 carbides giving rise to secondary hardening. In order to investigate the influences of steel microstructure on the <b>martensite</b> <b>tempering</b> kinetics two commercially produced DP 980 grade steels were used. The study suggests that the severity of <b>martensite</b> <b>tempering</b> can be avoided by modifying the microstructure of the steels; the DP 980 steel produced with a combination of martensite, ferrite, and a blocky retained austenite phase promotes high tensile strength of the laser welded joint similar to the un-welded material. Strength of the tempered martensite significantly differed depending on the nature of the tempering mode and heat input. Therefore, tempered martensite obtained from four different tempering modes was investigated. Extensive recovery and reduction of boundary regions was identified on the structure tempered slowly, whereas rapidly tempered structures retained a high density of dislocations and less decomposition of the lath structure. The study revealed that dislocation density has a prominent effect on the macroscopic strength of the tempered martensite over all other strength contributors. In addition, rapid thermal cycles retained a high density of dislocations after tempering thus improving the tempered martensite strength. Therefore, the combined effect of dislocation density and the rapid thermal cycle was investigated by deforming the martensitic sheets to different levels of plastic deformation and subsequently tempering using conventional furnace tempering and the laser beam welding. It was found that the increased dislocation density due to the plastic deformation caused more nucleation sites for cementite precipitation, short-range carbon diffusion, and shorter growth period of cementite. The morphologies of the cementite were changed from elongated to small quasi-spherical when the sheet was plastically deformed. The deformed and tempered martensite yielded higher microhardness resulting from finer and semicoherent precipitates, a high density of retained dislocation density, and the presence of untempered and partially tempered martensite blocks. The thermal analysis of <b>martensite</b> <b>tempering</b> carried out using a dilatometer suggests that the carbide precipitation temperature range increases to the higher tempering temperature when the sheet was subjected to rapid thermal cycles. Finally, a microstructural based model was applied to predict the yield strength and microhardness of the tempered martensite by incorporating the effects of heating rate, tempering temperature, and time. Experimental and modelling results suggest that the faster tempering mode in combination with a very short tempering duration provides the highest tempered martensite strength...|$|E

A pin-on-disc tribometer {{was used to}} simulate the two-body abrasive condition (i. e. the metallic surface abrading against the silicon carbide abrasive particles) and evaluate the specific wear rate of the microstructures. Each microstructure had a unique response towards the abrasion behaviour and this was largely evident in the friction curve. However, the multi-phase microstructures (i. e. bainite and pearlite) demonstrated better abrasion resistance than the single-phase microstructures (i. e. <b>martensite</b> and <b>tempered</b> <b>martensite).</b> Abrasion induced microstructural changes at the deformed surfaces were studied using sub-surface and topographical techniques. The properties of these layers (i. e. surface profile measurements) determined the amount of material loss for each microstructure. These were directly linked to the single-wear track analysis that highlighted a marked difference in their mode of material removal. Ploughing and wedge formation modes were dominant {{in the case of}} bainite and pearlite microstructures, whereas the cutting mode could be attributed to the higher material loss in the single-phase microstructures.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{quenched}} and tempered microstructures on the diffusion coefficient and solubility of hydrogen in high tensile strength bolt steel have been investigated {{by means of the}} electrochemical permeation technique. The results obtained are as follows : (1) The diffusion coefficient was minimum when the steel had the as-quenched martensitic structure or the low temperature <b>tempered</b> <b>martensite,</b> and it increased with increasing tempering temperature. The mixed structure of ferrite and lamellar pearlite obtained by furnace cooling from a temperature above Ac_ 3 gave a higher diffusion coefficient than the tempered spheroidal pearlite. On the other hand, the solubility of hydrogen showed a behavior opposite to the diffusion coefficient. (2) The low diffusion coefficient and high solubility are attributed predominantly to hydrogen trapping at the lattice imperfections, such as dislocations and faults etc., which were introduced by martensitic transformation during quenching. (3) With regard to the effect of cathodic current density, i. e., the hydrogen concentration directly below the surface on hydrogen diffusion in tempered steel, the diffusion coefficient hardly depended upon the hydrogen concentration but the solubility of hydrogen increased up to a certain value with increasing cathodic current density. On the other hand, the hydrogen permeation current efficiency decreased with increasing cathodic current density. (4) The activation energies for hydrogen diffusion in the <b>tempered</b> <b>martensite,</b> <b>tempered</b> fine and/or spheroidal pearlites in the temperature range of 6 to 61 ℃, were almost constant (about 8. 1 kcal/mol) but the pre-exponential factor increased with tempering temperature.

40|$|In {{addition}} to surface quality improvement, {{the formation of}} edge-zone compressive residual stresses represents an important aim of hard finishing as last shaping step of steel components. Plastic deformation by the mechanical material removal results in a higher density and energetically more stable structures of the dislocations in the small influenced rim region due to the induced microscopic gliding processes. Surface fin-ishing constitutes the final manufacturing operation in state-of-the-art machine part production. According to the presented current experimental findings on ground and honed through-hardened bearing steel 100 Cr 6 (1. 3505, SAE 52100), however, subse-quent post-machining thermal treatment (PMTT), i. e. simple reheating preferentially below the <b>martensite</b> <b>tempering</b> or bainite transformation temperature without hard-ness reduction, leads to an additional microstructural stabilization in the mechanically affected outermost material region, which generally represents the highest loaded zone under service conditions.

40|$|Martensitic and {{bainitic}} steels are {{two types}} of widely used steels with excellent mechanical behaviors in automatic industry. It’s universally acknowledged that as- quenched martensite possesses poor ductility and impact toughness, which should be tempered before putting into application. During <b>tempering,</b> as-quenched <b>martensite</b> changes from a hard and brittle microstructure to more ductile and softer microstructure, leading to improved mechanical properties for manufacturing. Bainitic microstructures is less sensitive to tempering in the improvement of mechanical properties, while the explicit tempering effects are still unknown. The primary goal of the current research is to study the effect of tempering on the microstructure and properties of martensitic and bainitic microstructures developed in the same low carbon steel with high content of silicon and manganese (0. 2 wt. %C- 2 wt. %Si- 3 wt. %Mn). Results show that for <b>tempered</b> <b>martensite,</b> the hardness, yield strength and tensile strength have a decreasing tendency with higher tempering temperatures. Through <b>tempering,</b> <b>martensite</b> became more ductile at the expense of strength.

However, previous studies have shown that in the absence of dispersoids, the ferrite phase is significantly less swelling resistant than the <b>tempered</b> <b>martensite</b> phase.

The aim of this research was to develop new ultra-high strength steels via nanoprecipitation control, which requires an understanding of the processing-microstructure-property relationship in medium carbon (0. 5 - 0. 6 wt. %) steels throughout tempering. Much of the work has been centred in understanding the role of silicon at the precipitation level and in the recovery of martensite. By using an existing spring steel grade, the effect of interrupted ageing (IA) in tempered martensite has been studied. In IA, an intermediate step between quenching and tempering is introduced, where quenched martensite is left to rest at room temperature for a defined period of time. By allowing carbon segregation into dislocation cores, the incorporation of IA resulted in a more stable microstructure and hardness improvement. The effect of silicon in the epsilon to cementite carbide transition has also been studied. The classical nucleation theory was applied in order to model cementite formation under paraequilibrium conditions, thus incorporating silicon during nucleation. Characterisation using high energy X-rays showed the inhibiting effect of silicon in the overall cementite precipitation. The second effect of silicon was observed in the martensite recovery. A series of experiments were carried out in order to capture the various microstructural changes taking place during tempering: precipitation, grain size and dislocation density evolution. It was observed that the addition of silicon reduces the rate of martensite recovery, owing to the reduced cross-slip in the ferrite lattice. A plasticity model based on irreversible thermodynamics and EBSD characterisation was applied to identify the effective grain size. The results from these two techniques require further research. Nevertheless, based on the post-failure analysis by TEM, it appears that at relatively early tempering stages, even low angle lath boundaries can contribute to strengthening, where piled-up dislocations have been observed at lath boundaries.

It has been however shown that the resistance to hydrogen embrittlement of X 37 CrMoV 5 - 1 steel with nanobainitic structure is higher as compared to the <b>tempered</b> <b>martensite.</b> After hydrogen charging the ductility of austempered steel is slightly higher than in case of quenched and tempered (Q&T) steel. This effect was interpreted as a result of phase composition formed after different heat treatments...|$|R

To facilitate such a need, a set of iron base electrodes {{are made in the}} laboratory. The Iron base alloys made contain carbon, silicon, manganese and boron. Overlay of the alloys are made on low carbon steel plates by manual metal arc welding. The Fe-C-Si-Mn-B deposits exhibited an average hardness of 700 VHN. The intermixing between the substrate and the deposit is quite appreciable. The evidence of the shift of C-curve to the right in the isothermal transformation diagram by promoting <b>tempered</b> <b>martensite</b> and lower bainite without quenching is evident. Boron addition in very small quantities in steel with enhanced contents of silicon and manganese generates the formation of <b>tempered</b> <b>martensite</b> and lower bainite, which shall be utilized for hardfacin...|$|R
5000|$|In the iron-carbon system (i.e. plain-carbon steels {{and cast}} irons) it {{is a common}} {{constituent}} because ferrite can contain at most 0.02wt% of uncombined carbon. Therefore, in carbon steels and cast irons that are slowly cooled, a portion of the carbon {{is in the form of}} cementite. [...] Cementite forms directly from the melt in the case of white cast iron. In carbon steel, cementite precipitates from austenite as austenite transforms to ferrite on slow cooling, or from <b>martensite</b> during <b>tempering.</b> An intimate mixture with ferrite, the other product of austenite, forms a lamellar structure called pearlite.|$|R
40|$|A {{study has}} been made {{concerning}} the effect of <b>tempered</b> <b>martensite</b> volume fraction on the fatigue behavior of quenched and tempered R 4 grade structural steel. As this material is largely used for fabricating offshore mooring chains, the study was extended to include quenched and tempered flash welded chain links. Martensite content was varied by varying the austenitization temperature and fatigue behavior of quenched and tempered specimens was determined by following crack growth during constant amplitude cyclic loading. The results indicate that {{an increase in the}} <b>tempered</b> <b>martensite</b> volume fraction is associated with a {{reduction in the number of}} cycles to failure and that for a given microstructural condition, the fatigue life of the welded joints is invariably shorter than that of the base metal. Finally, the fatigue behavior is presented and discussed considering the mechanical properties and the toughness of the fatigued specimens. ...|$|R
40|$|Due to its optimal {{balance of}} {{strength}} and toughness, AISI 8630 M low alloy steel forgings are extensively used as structural components for subsea applications in {{the oil and gas}} energy sector. However, considering the high pressures and low temperatures conditions in deep water environments {{the oil and gas industry}} has continuously been demanding higher reliability levels on the structural integrity of large steel forgings in order to avoid in-service premature failures. In particular, special attention has been given to the CTOD fracture toughness as a critical parameter for structural design. Heat treatment is the last stage in the manufacturing sequence of large forgings and to certain extent, defines the metallurgical characteristics of final component. The cooling rate during industrial quenching treatment represents one of the most important processing parameters controlling the microstructure before tempering treatment. The research programme involved industrial-scale experimental heat treatments in which largescale forged segments with two different cross-sections (100 and 250 mm) were separately subjected to water, aqueous polymer solution and vegetable oil quenching and then tempered at 590 °C, to evaluate the influence of cooling rate on the microstructure and mechanical properties produced under industrial conditions. Tensile, CVN and CTOD fracture toughness properties were measured at RT, - 30 °C and 0 °C respectively as per specification requirements. Microstructural evolution and fracture surfaces were evaluated by high resolution scanning electron microscopy. A CCT diagram was constructed by means of quenching dilatometry in order to validate the microstructural changes produced during industrial quenching. In summary, the present investigation, showed that irrespective of the cross section, the faster, intermediate, and slower cooling times between 800 °C and 500 °C (λ, t 8 / 5) were obtained by water, polymer and vegetable oil respectively. Kinematic viscosity may be the main variable controlling the cooling performance of the different cooling media evaluated due to changes in the thermophysical properties of the quenchants. In addition, the predominant microstructures for the different thickness-quenchant conditions were found to be associated with mixtures of tempered bainite and <b>tempered</b> <b>martensite.</b> This was evidenced by the fact that the majority ofthe industrial cooling curves fell within a similar microstructural region of the CCT (0. 03 - 1 ˚C/s) dilatometric diagram which consisted of mixtures of martensite and bainite. Accordingly, the mechanical properties evaluated were similar among the different thickness quenchant conditions investigated. In this sense, all conditions evaluated showed strength and impact toughness properties well above the material specification limit for the selected forged component. It can be argued that the strength and impact toughness are controlled by changes in the distribution and size of carbide precipitates and packet substructure associated with the different fractions of <b>tempered</b> <b>martensite</b> and <b>tempered</b> bainite generated by changes in cooling rate. Accordingly, the higher strength and impact toughness values were observed at mixtures of <b>tempered</b> <b>martensite</b> (TM) and <b>tempered</b> bainite (TB) with proportions of 85...|$|R

40|$|The main {{explanations}} for <b>tempered</b> <b>martensite</b> embrittlement {{are based on}} the effects of impurities and cementite precipitation on the prior austenite grain boundaries. There are some studies where the rate of work hardening is proposed as a potential reason for the brittleness. One steel was studied by means of a specially developed precision torsional testing device. The test steel had a high Si and Ni content so ε carbide and Fe 3 C appear in quite different tempering temperature ranges. The Ms temperature is low enough so that self tempering does not occur. With the testing device it was possible to obtain the true stress - true strain curves to very high deformations. The minimum toughness was always associated with the minimum of rate of work hardening. The change of deformed steel volume before the loss of mechanical stability is proposed as at least one reason for <b>tempered</b> <b>martensite</b> embrittlement. The reasons for the minimum of the rate of work hardening are considered...|$|R
