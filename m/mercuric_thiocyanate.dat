40|$|Chloride in {{the sample}} {{displaces}} thiocyanate from <b>mercuric</b> <b>thiocyanate,</b> which in turn combines with iron of ferric nitrate to become ferric thiocyanate, which is a coloured compound.

40|$|The reagent {{described}} is 5. 5 M in perchioric {{acid and}} 3. 3 M in urea. It contains ferric ions, <b>mercuric</b> <b>thiocyanate,</b> mercuric ions (from mercuric perchiorate), and mercuric chloride. Serum dissolves directly in this reagent {{to yield a}} clear, reddish solution. When chloride ions are added, they combine first with the free mercuric ions, and then {{with some of the}} mercuric ions from the <b>mercuric</b> <b>thiocyanate.</b> Liberated thio-cyanate combines with ferric ions to yield red ferric thiocyanate. The color is much more intense in the presence of strong perchioric acid than in other aqueous acid mixtures, Its intensity can be regulated at will by changing the concentration of the ferric iron. The presence of mercuric chloride in the reagent improves linearity be-tween absorbance and chloride concentration. After the total absorbance is determined, compensation for absorbance by other substances is secured by adding mercuric ions to the photometer tube to reverse the color-producing reaction of chloride, reading the residual absorbance, and subtracting it from the total absorbance, to give a net absorbance produced by chloride alone. I N VIEW of previous reports of success with <b>mercuric</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> meth-ods for the direct photometric measurement of chloride concentration in water (6) and in concentrated hydrogen peroxide (1), efforts were made to adapt the method to analysis of serum. The chemical principle depends upon the reactions 2 Cl + Hg(SCN) o HgCl 0 (very slightly ionized) + 2 SCN (1...|$|E
40|$|Chlorine may be {{determined}} in polyurethane by gravimetric or spectrophotometric techniques. The sample is burned {{in a special}} combustion tube with two oxygen inlets, the products of combustion are absorbed in a solution containing sodium hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide, and the chlorine is measured either gravimetrically as silver chloride or spectrophotometrically using <b>mercuric</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> and ferric perchlorate. Eighteen determinations of cblorine in known solutions of sodium chloroacetate or perchloric acid gave an average recovery of 98. 3 % {{with a standard deviation}} of 2. 8 %. (auth...|$|E
40|$|I {{show how}} <b>mercuric</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> reagent {{can be used}} in {{assaying}} serum chloride economically, rapidly, and precisely. I used a semiautomated discrete analyzer with direct concentration read-out capability but the method can easily be applied to many mechanized in-struments. Linearity between concentration and color is obtained by adding appropriate amounts of mercuric ni-trate to the reagent. As many as 300 samples can be assayed per hour, and the method is excellent for emergency use. Mercuric thiocyanate/fernic nitrate reagent has long been used for assaying chloride in serum (1). Unfortunate-ly, the widely used mechanized version (Technicon Au-toAnalyzer) is not as precise as might be desired (2), assays only 60 samples per hour, and requires relatively length...|$|E
40|$|At Matsuzaki, Togo and Asozu Hot Springs and at Hamamura and Kachimi Hot Springs, {{the amounts}} of {{chloride}} and sulfate fixed to soil were determined with samples which were colleted from {{various parts of the}} thermal spring zone and its outside area, more than ten days after rainfall, so as to eliminate its possible effect. The amounts of sulfate were determined by terbidimetry with BaCl(2) solution and those of chloride were determined by　<b>mercuric</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> method. In the average amounts of chloride and sulfate, no {{differences were found between the}} samples collected from the thermal spring zone and its　outside area. The same fact was described in the 5 th and 8 th reports, but errorneously ascribed to an effect of rainfall. From the present study it has been ascertained that the fact is independent of rainfall...|$|E
40|$|The cages [{La 2 (NCS) 5 (NCMe) 6 } 2 O]·MeCN and [{Eu 2 (NCS) 5 (NCMe) 5 } 2 O]·MeCN {{have been}} {{prepared}} by redox transmetallation between the lanthanoid metals and <b>mercuric</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> in acetonitrile. The structure of the former has a core of four La atoms bonded to a central oxygen atom. Two La atoms are nine coordinate being bonded to oxygen, four terminal MeCN ligands and four N-bridged thiocyanato ligands, whereas {{the other two are}} eight coordinate being bonded to oxygen, the four bridging thiocyanato ligands, two terminal acetonitrile molecules, and a terminal N-bonded thiocyanate ion. In the Eu complex, there is a similar core of four Ln atoms bound to a central oxygen atom, but all Eu atoms are eight coordinate, and have four N-bridged thiocyanate ligands. Two have three MeCN ligands, whilst the other two have one terminal NCS− and two acetonitrile ligands...|$|E
40|$|The {{preparation}} and characterization of new materials to make ion-selective membranes are described. The usefulness of zinc orthophosphate and zinc <b>mercuric</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> {{to make a}} carbon-support electrode responsive to zinc was investigated. Better results were obtained with zinc orthophosphate. However, the electrode response was lowered by the formation of acidic oxides {{on the surface of}} the electrode, and interferences from copper(II), lead(II), and cadmium(II) were observed. An indirect potentiometric method based on the selective monitoring of chlorozincate(II) or cyanozincate(II) anions with a coated-wire ion-selective electrode was proposed as an alternative for monitoring zinc ion. The application of quaternary ammonium, phosphonium, and alkyl phosphate ionic polymer membranes to potentiometric and voltammetric analysis was also studied. Ionic polymer membranes offer a number of advantages, namely improved membrane lifetime and enhanced adherence to solid-substrate electrodes, when compared to conventional ion-selective membranes. The last stage of this research focused on the application of ionic polymer membrane electrodes in flow injection analysis...|$|E
40|$|A simple {{procedure}} {{using an}} identical manifold {{was developed for}} determination of nitrogen (protein) phosphorus, calcium, chloride, copper, manganese, iron, and zinc in feeds and feedstuffs. By changing appropriate reagents and detection wavelength, these 8 elements were determined successively with a simple identical double-line flow injection (FI) manifold. FI spectrophotometric determinations {{were made by the}} blue indophenol reaction for ammonium, the molybdenum blue method for phosphate, the cresolphthalein complexone procedure for calcium, and the <b>mercuric</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> procedure for chloride. The chromogenic reagents for copper, iron, manganese, and zinc determination were bis(cyclohexanone) oxalydihydrazone (Cuprizone), 1, 10 -phenanthroline, formaldoxime, and xylenol orange, respectively. Sample digestion catalyst, Fl manifold, and some chemical parameters were optimized. The proposed procedure had a sampling rate of 90 /h for each analyte. The determination ranges (mg/L) were 10 - 60 for N, 1 - 15 for P and Ca, 5 - 40 for Cl, and 0. 5 - 15 for Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn, respectively. Results of the analyses of animal feed and feedstuff samples by this procedure did not differ significantly from those obtained by proven manual methods...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to study the}} factors which cause grossly elevated values in an automated procedure for chloride when the sample is contaminated with bromide. The questioned <b>mercuric</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> method of the autoanalyzer was compared to a similar system utilizing mercuric 2, 4, 6 -tripyridyl-s-triazine as a substitute ligand source in the chloride exchange system. It was determined that variation {{in the rate of}} dialysis of the halides was one factor which provided a compensating error apparently owing to a graded increase in rate of diffusion with an increase in hydrated ion size. The variable release of thiocyanate by the different halides as compared to the equivalent release of ligand from the tripyridyl-s-triazine (TPTZ) complex by the halides was another important factor. When both factors were considered, the non-linear elevated results could at least be partially explained. Es wurden die Faktoren untersucht, die bei der automatischen Chloridbestimmung in Gegenwart von Bromid die erheblich erhöhten Werte verursachen. Die unter Gebrauch von Autoanalysatoren in Frage kommende Quecksilberthiocyanatmethode wurde mit einer ähnlichen Methode verglichen, die Quecksilber- 2, 4, 6 -Tripyridyl-S-Triazin als Bindemittel im Chloridaustauschsystem verwendet...|$|E
40|$|Two simple, {{accurate}} and selective methods for {{the determination of}} diphenhydramine in pharmaceutical grade sample and in dosage forms are described. The titrimetric method {{is based on the}} precipitation of the chloride content of the drug as AgCl with a known excess of silver nitrate and back titration of the residual silver nitrate with thiocyanate using iron(III) as indicator. The reaction stoichiometry and the range of determination have been evaluated. The spectrophotometric method involves the displacement of thiocyanate of <b>mercuric</b> <b>thiocyanate</b> from the ionized chloride and the subsequent reaction of the liberated thiocyanate with iron(III) to form the familiar red colored complex, Fe(SCN) (2 +) which is measured spectrophotometrically at 460 nm. The Beer's law is obeyed over the range 4 - 45 mug mL(- 1) of diphenhydramine HCl, the molar absorptivity and Sandell sensitivity being 3. 45 x 10 (3) L(.) mol(- 1) cm(- 1) and 84. 5 ng cm(2), respectively at 460 nm. The reaction variables have been optimized. The methods {{have been found to be}} very simple, cost-effective and reliable for three dosage forms containing diphenhydramine hydrochloride...|$|E
40|$|The {{major cause}} for {{degradation}} of reinforced concrete due to chloride penetration {{has been the}} great research effort. A large number of published literatures on chloride penetration for ultra-high performance concrete have been reported. In this paper, the strength and the chloride resistance characteristic of the nanoclayed ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC-NC) were investigated. Series of ultra-high performance concrete specimens comprise of 0 %, 1 %, 3 % and 5 % of nanoclay replacing the total weight of cement were produced. Four (4) series of UHPC-NC specimens were designated as UHPC, UHPC-NC 1, UHPC-NC 3 and UHPC-NC 5 respectively. The workability of fresh UHPC and UHPC-NCs, strength performance and chloride content of UHPC and UHPC-NCs measured using <b>Mercuric</b> <b>Thiocyanate</b> method were investigated. It is reported that all the UHPC mixes have high workability however; UHPC-NC 5 recorded the lowest slump reading. It also clearly emerges that replacing 1 % of cement with nanoclay enhance significantly the compressive and splitting tensile strength as compared to that without nanoclay. The optimum nanoclay replacement level {{was found to be}} 1 % from the total weight of OPC for strength, but not for chloride diffusion. In term of total chloride content, it is revealed that the incorporation of nanoclay into UHPC mix leads to the reduction of chloride diffusion of the resulted UHPC. It shows that 5 % replacement level of nanoclay effectively decreases the chloride diffusivity in UHPC...|$|E
