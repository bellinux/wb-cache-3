5000|$|Several {{numbers of}} M-tp M-TP {{were used in}} former times for various {{advertising}} purposes: along with [...] "Chắc ai đó sẽ về", [...] "Không phải dạng vừa đâu" [...] also served as the soundtrack for Dandelion in 2014; the family-themed [...] "Ấn nút nhớ... Thả giấc mơ" [...] ("Push the <b>memory</b> <b>button</b> to free your dreams") and [...] "Một năm mới bình an" [...] ("A peaceful new year") were songs for Omo detergent and Oppo mobile phone campaigns, respectively in 2015 and 2016; the remixed [...] "Nắng ấm xa dần" [...] had made its appearance earlier in 2016 on the singer's commercial for Không Độ green tea. Notably absent from the compilation was the moderately-received 2013 single [...] "Đừng về trễ". The song, however, had also been accused of taking Gain's [...] "Nostalgia" [...] instrumental track, while its vocal performance was being compared to GD & TOP's 2010 song [...] "Baby Good Night".|$|E

50|$|A quirk that catches many first-time users is {{that the}} lower right preset and user <b>memory</b> <b>buttons</b> {{disengage}} most programmable controls {{to the right of}} the arpeggiator section when a user or factory preset is used. The controls {{to the right of the}} arpeggiator are only live when the yellow manual button is selected. The controls are analog switches and potentiometers, but do not adjust the synth cards directly. They are supplied with hi/low logic voltages or 0-5 volt voltages. Multiplexers and analog to digital converters read the settings, then send them in digital form to the CPU. The CPU then converts these parameters to analog control voltages, and sends them to the analog voice cards and envelope gates. It is a remarkably stable hybrid pioneer with a great analog sound.|$|R

5000|$|Sega {{released}} an official 4x Memory Card which offered {{four times the}} data storage of a standard VMU, with 800 blocks. It was released in Japan on December 14, 2000 as [...] "Memory Card 4X", and in the USA as [...] "4x <b>Memory</b> Card". A <b>button</b> is used to select one of four [...] "pages", {{and a series of}} four orange LED on the card indicates which of these is currently in use. Not all games are compatible, so Sega released a list of incompatible games.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} IBM PC had no hardware {{reset button}} and IBM {{did not include}} one on any of their personal computers until the early 1990s, however many clones began sporting them early on. All PC compatibles can be rebooted by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del, which triggers the BIOS startup routines and re-initializes and reboots the computer, but does not invoke the Power On Start Up Test (POST) or clear <b>memory.</b> Hardware reset <b>buttons</b> on PCs work by causing a momentary power interruption to the CPU, which resets it and causes the computer to reboot. Unlike Ctrl+Alt+Del, pressing the reset button causes the BIOS to perform the POST check. By the early 2000s, reset buttons had largely disappeared from PCs although the connector for them is still present on motherboards.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} {{the implementation of}} a phantom limb pain (PLP) home-based system using virtual reality (VR) and a motion sensor to immerse the users in a virtual environment (VE). The work is inspired by mirror therapy (MT), which has been used to relieve PLP. The target patient group focuses on unilateral upper-limb amputees with phantom pain. Using a motion sensor, the system tracks the movement of a user’s hand and translates it onto the virtual hand. The system consists of exercises including opening and closing the hand, rotating the hand, and finer finger movements. These exercises are conveyed in the VR as three games: (1) A bending game, where the patients have to bend a rod, (2) a box game where the patients pick up and place boxes with their hands, (3) and a <b>button</b> <b>memory</b> game where the patients have to push buttons in a given sequence. These games were tested on twelve healthy participants to evaluate if the games encouraged similar movements as in MT. Prior to the experiment a preliminary test was conducted on an amputee with PLP to gather qualitative feedback from an end-user. The results indicated that the games did convey the exercises from the MT, although further testing is needed...|$|R
2500|$|This {{conclusion}} {{on human}} unity {{was supported by}} monogenism, including John Bachman's evidence that intercrossed human races were fully fertile. Proponents of polygenism opposed unity, but the gradual transition from one race to another confused them {{when they tried to}} decide how many human races should count as species: Louis Agassiz said eight, but Morton said twenty-two. Darwin commented that the [...] "question whether mankind consists of one or several species has of late years been much agitated by anthropologists, who are divided into two schools of monogenists and polygenists." [...] The latter had to [...] "look at species either as separate creations or as in some manner distinct entities". but those accepting evolution [...] "will feel no doubt that all the races of man are descended from a single primitive stock". Although races differed considerably, they also shared so many features [...] "that it is extremely improbable that they should have been independently acquired by aboriginally distinct species or races." [...] He drew on his <b>memories</b> of Jemmy <b>Button</b> and John Edmonstone to emphasise [...] "the numerous points of mental similarity between the most distinct races of man. The American aborigines, Negroes and Europeans differ as much from each other in mind as any three races that can be named; yet I was incessantly struck, whilst living with the Fuegians on board the Beagle, with the many little traits of character, shewing how similar their minds were to ours; and so it was with a full-blooded negro with whom I happened once to be intimate." [...] Darwin concluded that [...] "...when the principles of evolution are generally accepted, as they surely will be before long, the dispute between the monogenists and the polygenists will die a silent and unobserved death." ...|$|R
