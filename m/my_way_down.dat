500|$|Film {{historian}} Joseph McBride considered O'Hara's {{performance to}} have been the most powerful and intense emotionally he'd seen since Katharine Hepburn in Mary of Scotland (1936). O'Hara stated that her favorite scene in the film took place outside the church after her character gets married, remarking, [...] "I make <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the steps to the carriage waiting below, the wind catches my veil and fans it out in a perfect circle all the way around my face. Then it floats straight up above my head and points to the heavens. It's breathtaking." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>My</b> <b>way</b> was <b>down</b> {{the glen}} of the Leith River, towards Stockbridge and Silvermills. A path led {{in the foot}} of it, the water bickered and sang in the midst; the sunbeams {{overhead}} struck {{out of the west}} among long shadows and (as the valley turned) made like a new scene and a new world of it at every corner. With Catriona behind and Alan before me, I was like one lifted up. The place besides, and the hour, and the talking of the water, infinitely pleased me; and I lingered in my steps and looked before and behind me as I went. This was the cause, under providence, that I spied a little in my rear a red head among some bushes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I say, Ayesha, that I will not," [...] he repeated; [...] "moreover, that if thou leavest me here I {{will find}} <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the {{mountain}} alone, {{and join the}} battle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very good, sir," [...] I replied, and {{was making}} <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the poop ladder, when I heard him calling me, {{in a low}} voice, by the old name: [...] "Richard!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Digital Spy {{gave the}} track {{four out of}} five stars, stating [...] "Wherever there is {{political}} controversy these days, you can bet Plan B isn't far behind. For those still in the dark about his latest project, the singer, rapper, actor and director has depicted a particularly shocking side to life on London's gangs and forgotten estates for his new film iLL Manors. Fittingly, he's written an album's worth of material to soundtrack the flick. 'Lost My Way' combines soul for those who enjoyed his previous Strickland Banks LP with the gritty rapping style that fans who better know him as Ben Drew will already be familiar with. [...] "Lost <b>my</b> <b>way,</b> Fell <b>down</b> a hole, No-one gonna come and save my soul," [...] he spits with a sharp tongue over pummelling drums and a twisted piano hook. The result, as you'd expect, is brutally dark yet utterly compelling." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I can't help it. I can't {{keep his}} hours {{and do my}} work. Yes, I know we are {{drifting}} apart; I wish I could help it, but being coupled up together makes it rather worse than better. It aggravates him, and he will really get on better without Gooch to worry him, and thrust <b>my</b> droning old <b>ways</b> <b>down</b> his throat,--as if Prince Hal could bear to be twitted with [...] "that sober boy, Lord John of Lancaster." [...] Not,' he added, catching himself up, 'that I meant to compare him to the madcap Prince. He is the finest of fellows, if they only would let him alone.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He couldn't {{watch her}} so close, {{but what she}} could make her <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to mother's shop now and again. Or, for the matter of that, but what I could make <b>my</b> <b>way</b> up to the house." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "For life or death, I {{care not}} which, {{so long as}} I am with you!" [...] I said, as I moved off. Descending the Jacob's ladder, I made <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the rock-hewn passage.|$|E
6000|$|... "See {{what you}} can do with him, then," [...] Forrest said, as they retraced their steps. [...] "I'll call in and hear if you've {{anything}} to tell me on <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> for dinner." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1940 he got {{the lead}} role in Rodgers and Hart's Pal Joey, again choreographed by Robert Alton. This role {{propelled}} him to stardom. During its run he told reporters: [...] "I don't believe in conformity to any school of dancing. I create what the drama and the music demand. While I am a hundred percent for ballet technique, I use only what I can adapt to my own use. I never let technique {{get in the way}} of mood or continuity." [...] His colleagues at this time noticed his great commitment to rehearsal and hard work. Van Johnson—who also appeared in Pal Joey—recalled: [...] "I watched him rehearsing, and it seemed to me that there was no possible room for improvement. Yet he wasn't satisfied. It was midnight and we had been rehearsing since eight in the morning. I was making <b>my</b> <b>way</b> sleepily <b>down</b> the long flight of stairs when I heard staccato steps coming from the stage...I could see just a single lamp burning. Under it, a figure was dancing...Gene." ...|$|R
60|$|At length, grown {{weary and}} {{uncertain}} of <b>my</b> <b>way,</b> I sank <b>down</b> {{to rest and}} think. And my thoughts were chiefly of that hermit somewhere above me in these hills, and of the blessedness of such a life, remote from the world that man had made so evil. And then, with thinking of the world, came thoughts of Giuliana. Two nights ago I had held her in my arms. Two nights ago! And already it seemed a century remote--as remote as {{all the rest of}} that life of which it seemed a part. For there had been a break in my existence with the murder of Fifanti, and in the past two days I had done more living and I had aged more than in all the eighteen years before.|$|R
60|$|One evening, feeling oppressed in the tree-enclosed park of Ashfields, I strolled {{out of it}} {{into the}} suburb of which I have spoken. Almost {{opposite}} the private garden of the park stands a board school, {{and in front of}} this board school I had laid out an acre of land presented by myself, as a playground and open space {{for the use of the}} public. In the centre of this garden was a fountain that fell into a marble basin, and around the fountain, but at some distance from it, stood iron seats. To these I made <b>my</b> <b>way</b> and sat <b>down</b> on one of them, which was empty, in order to enjoy the cool sound of the splashing water, about which a large number of children were playing.|$|R
60|$|Amidst {{these dreams}} came evening, and then Martha brought a light; with her aid I was quickly dressed, and {{stronger}} {{now than in}} the morning, I made <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to the blue saloon unassisted.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I'll have to go," [...] said Frank to Richard. [...] "I'll stop at {{the store}} on <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> and let the firm know, and also help you enough to get along while I am gone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Great days, those. Was {{a likely}} chap myself when I struck the coast. Jumped a whaler, the Pole Star, at Unalaska, and worked <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to Sitka on an otter hunter. Picked up with Happy Jack there--know him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think perhaps}} it's my childhood." [...] She halted. When {{she went on}} her voice had an {{artificial}} sound, her words the bookish quality of emotional meditation. [...] "My father was the tenderest man in the world, but he did feel superior to ordinary people. Well, he was! And the Minnesota Valley----I used to sit there on the cliffs above Mankato {{for hours at a}} time, my chin in <b>my</b> hand, looking <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the valley, wanting to write poems. The shiny tilted roofs below me, and the river, and beyond it the level fields in the mist, and the rim of palisades across----It held my thoughts in. I LIVED, in the valley. But the prairie--all my thoughts go flying off into the big space. Do you think it might be that?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2008, Oquendo saw {{action in}} all 13 games {{including}} five starts. He made 29 receptions for 371 yards including two touchdowns and a 50-yard long. Due to his sure hands, Oquendo was quarterback Chris Turner's preferred third-down receiver, and caught 13 passes on third downs, {{all of which}} gained enough yardage to convert to a first down. Star Z receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey said, [...] "I tell people Turner doesn’t look <b>my</b> <b>way</b> on third <b>down,</b> he's looking for Danny … I’ve been telling people all year. I even told a back one time in the game 'He ain't coming my way.' Danny’s the man." [...] On special teams, Oquendo returned 20 punt returns for 104 yards when he was utilized in that position for his reliable hands rather than an elusive returning ability. Oquendo also recorded one completion on two trick play pass attempts for a 43-yard touchdown.|$|R
6000|$|... "A curious thing {{happened}} to me," [...] he said, [...] "when I was a child. I {{could hardly have been}} six years old. I had gone to Ghent with my parents. I think it was to visit some relative. One day we went into the castle. It was in ruins then, but has since been restored. We were in what was once the council chamber. I stole away by myself {{to the other end of}} the great room and, not knowing why I did so, I touched a spring concealed in the masonry, and a door swung open with a harsh, grinding noise. I remember peering round the opening. The others had their backs towards me, and I slipped through and closed the door behind me. I seemed instinctively to know <b>my</b> <b>way.</b> I ran <b>down</b> a flight of steps and along dark corridors through which I had to feel <b>my</b> <b>way</b> with <b>my</b> hands, till I came to a small door in an angle of the wall. I knew the room that lay the other side. A photograph was taken of it and published years afterwards, when the place was discovered, and it was exactly as I knew it with its way out underneath the city wall through one of the small houses in the Aussermarkt.|$|R

6000|$|... "I have {{no desire}} to stay with the white pasha," [...] Edgar said; [...] "I would rather be with you than in so hopeless a {{position}} as he is; but I might make <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to the coast?" ...|$|E
60|$|The mere idea of {{involving}} {{the girl in}} my household problem seemed exciting enough, and on <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to the city I became a bit less confident. I decided to approach the matter of my shopping diplomatically. She might be alarmed at my precipitancy.|$|E
60|$|He {{accepted}} my {{offer at}} once, and proved himself an intelligent sightseer. He {{seemed to know}} a little about everything, including horses. I took him on to the orchid-houses, and it was quite {{an hour and a half}} before we returned to the house. I left him once more in the library, and I was on <b>my</b> <b>way</b> upstairs, when I came face to face with Rust and another man on their <b>way</b> <b>down.</b> For a moment I was speechless.|$|R
