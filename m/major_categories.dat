5|$|In most <b>major</b> <b>categories,</b> Phoenix {{had a lower}} {{incidence}} of death {{than the rest of}} the nation. Only deaths due to Alzheimer's (29.7 to 27.2 deaths per 100,000) and pre-natal conditions (5.3 to 3.8 deaths per 100,000) were slightly above the national average. Deaths due to HIV and liver disease were exactly at the national average of 2.5 and 10.8 respectively. However, in several <b>major</b> <b>categories,</b> Phoenix had significantly lower indices of death: deaths by cancer stood at only 57% (106) of the national average of 184.6 deaths per 100,000; deaths due to heart disease, 56.1% of the national rate of 249.8 per 100,000. Cancer and heart disease were the two top causes of death in the country.|$|E

50|$|Profusion: Using the Standard X-rays, the profusion (concentration) {{of small}} opacities is {{classified}} on a 4-point <b>major</b> <b>category</b> scale (0, 1, 2, or 3), with each <b>major</b> <b>category</b> divided into three, giving 12 ordered subcategories of increasing profusion: 0/-, 0/0, 0/1, 1/0, 1/1, 1/2, 2/1, 2/2, 2/3, 3/2, 3/3, and 3/+. Category 0 {{refers to the}} absence of small opacity and category 3 represents the most profuse. The <b>major</b> <b>category</b> (first number) represents the profusion felt to best fit the subject x-ray, and the minor category (second number) represents either the profusion seriously considered as an alternative, or if none, the same profusion as the <b>major</b> <b>category.</b> For example, if the reader thinks the x-ray being read has profusion most like the standard x-ray for category 1, but serious considered category 2 as an alternative description of the profusion, then the reading is 1/2.|$|R

5|$|According {{to their}} shared {{physical}} and chemical properties, the elements can be classified into the <b>major</b> <b>categories</b> of metals, metalloids and nonmetals. Metals are generally shiny, highly conducting solids that form alloys {{with one another and}} salt-like ionic compounds with nonmetals (other than the noble gases). The majority of nonmetals are coloured or colourless insulating gases; nonmetals that form compounds with other nonmetals feature covalent bonding. In between metals and nonmetals are metalloids, which have intermediate or mixed properties.|$|E

5|$|Barton Fink premiered in May 1991 at the Cannes Film Festival. Beating {{competition}} {{which included}} Jacques Rivette's La Belle Noiseuse, Spike Lee's Jungle Fever, and David Mamet's Homicide, the Coen brothers' film won three awards: Best Director, Best Actor, {{and the top}} prize Palme d'Or. This sweep of awards in <b>major</b> <b>categories</b> at Cannes was extremely rare, and some critics felt the jury was too generous {{to the exclusion of}} other worthy entries. Worried that the triple victory could set a precedent which would undervalue other films, Cannes decided after the 1991 festival to limit each movie to a maximum of two awards.|$|E
5|$|Comets can loosely {{be divided}} into two categories: short-period and long-period—the latter being thought to {{originate}} in the Oort cloud. The two <b>major</b> <b>categories</b> of short-period comets are Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) and Halley-type comets. Halley-type comets, which are named after their prototype, Halley's Comet, are thought to have originated in the Oort cloud but to have been drawn into the inner Solar System by the gravity of the giant planets, whereas the JFCs are thought to have originated in the scattered disc. The centaurs are thought to be a dynamically intermediate stage between the scattered disc and the Jupiter family.|$|E

During the 2004 playoffs, the Spurs met their perennial rivals, the Los Angeles Lakers, in the Western Conference Semifinals. Following Game 5 where Derek Fisher scored a buzzer-beating jump shot, the Spurs lost Game 6 and the series 4–2.

5|$|Production of lead is {{increasing}} worldwide {{due to its}} use in lead–acid batteries. There are two <b>major</b> <b>categories</b> of production: primary from mined ores, and secondary from scrap. In 2014, 4.58million metric tons came from primary production and 5.64million from secondary production. The top three producers of mined lead concentrate in that year were China, Australia, and the United States. The top three producers of refined lead were China, the United States, and South Korea. According to the International Resource Panel's Metal Stocks in Society report of 2010, {{the total amount of}} lead in use, stockpiled, discarded or dissipated into the environment, on a global basis, is 8kg per capita. Much of this is in more developed countries (20–150kg per capita) rather than less developed ones (1–4kg per capita).|$|E

Alabama remained the conference leader in all four <b>major</b> <b>categories</b> as well. On offense, the Crimson Tide dropped to 23rd in scoring offense (35.67 points per game), 21st in rushing offense (214.44 yards per game), 30th in total offense (439.56 yards per game) and 68th in passing offense (225.11 yards per game).

5|$|As is {{the case}} with the <b>major</b> <b>categories</b> of metals, {{metalloids}} and nonmetals, there is some variation and overlapping of properties within and across each category of nonmetal. Among the polyatomic nonmetals, carbon, phosphorus and selenium—which border the metalloids—begin to show some metallic character. Sulfur (which borders the diatomic nonmetals), is the least metallic of the polyatomic nonmetals but even here shows some discernible metal-like character (discussed below). Of the diatomic nonmetals, iodine is the most metallic. Its number of nearest neighbours is sometimes described as 1+2 hence it is almost a polyatomic nonmetal. Within the iodine molecule, significant electronic interactions occur with the two next nearest neighbours of each atom, and these interactions give rise, in bulk iodine, to a shiny appearance and semiconducting properties. Of the monatomic nonmetals, radon is the most metallic and begins to show some cationic behaviour, which is unusual for a nonmetal.|$|E
5|$|Many {{factors have}} {{influenced}} the construction of dams along the Snake River. A total of fifteen dams have been constructed along the Snake River for a multitude of different purposes, from its headwaters in the Rocky Mountains to its mouth on Lake Wallula, a slackwater reservoir formed behind McNary Dam on the Columbia River. Dams on the Snake can be grouped into three <b>major</b> <b>categories.</b> From its headwaters {{to the beginning of}} Hells Canyon, many small dams block the Snake to provide irrigation water. Between here and Hells Canyon, the first dam on the Snake, Swan Falls Dam, was built in 1901. In Hells Canyon, a cascade of dams produce hydroelectricity from the river's lofty decrease in elevation over a comparatively small distance. Finally, a third cascade of dams, from Hells Canyon to the mouth, facilitates navigation. Many different government and private agencies have worked to build dams on the Snake River, which now serve an important purpose for people living in the Snake's drainage basin and trade of agricultural products to Pacific seaports.|$|E

In 2004, a Corps of Engineers study was done on the cost and feasibility of protecting southeast Louisiana from a <b>major</b> <b>Category</b> 5 hurricane, including construction of floodgate structures and raising existing levees.
