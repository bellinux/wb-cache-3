5000|$|Even {{before the}} {{planning}} of the underground project had been completed, several locations were prepared for construction. In connection with the airport extension, which took place from 1966 to 1968, an indoor car park was built underneath the <b>motorway</b> <b>feeder</b> <b>road</b> {{in front of the}} terminal. It was constructed in a way that rebuilding it into a subway station could have been achieved with minimal effort. While the construction of the shopping mall [...] "Shopville" [...] underneath Zurich main station was underway from 1968 to 1970, side walls for the possible underground station were built, too. A pedestrian subway was constructed at Schaffhauserplatz, which could have been used as an entrance to the underground station. In order to not unnecessarily slow down the construction of the <b>motorway</b> <b>feeder</b> <b>road</b> [...] "A1L", a resolution was passed: Underneath and in conjunction with the Schöneich tunnel, the structural work was to be carried out on a 1364 m long section of the underground tunnel. The municipal authorities explicitly emphasized the possible usage as a tramline, should the underground project fail [...] "against expectations". On 14 March 1971, the voters of Zurich agreed on this part of the project that would cost 31 million Swiss Francs. Voter participation was 56.2% and there were 111,413 [...] "yes" [...] votes (78.47%) against 31,395 [...] "no" [...] votes.|$|E
500|$|The {{highlight}} of Croatia's recent infrastructure developments is its rapidly developed motorway network, largely {{built in the}} late 1990s {{and especially in the}} 2000s (decade). [...] By September 2011, Croatia had completed more than [...] of motorways, connecting Zagreb to most other regions and following various European routes and four Pan-European corridors. The busiest motorways are the A1, connecting Zagreb to Split and the A3, passing east–west through northwest Croatia and Slavonia. A widespread network of state roads in Croatia acts as <b>motorway</b> <b>feeder</b> <b>roads</b> while connecting all major settlements in the country. The high quality and safety levels of the Croatian motorway network were tested and confirmed by several EuroTAP and EuroTest programs.|$|R
