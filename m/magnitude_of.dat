5|$|Relative to both {{luminosity}} {{and distance}} from Earth, a star's absolute magnitude (M) and apparent magnitude (m) are not equivalent; for example, the bright star Sirius has an apparent <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> −1.44, {{but it has}} an absolute <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> +1.41.|$|E
5|$|As an A-type main {{sequence}} star, Beta Pictoris is more luminous than the Sun: combining the apparent <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> 3.861 with {{the distance of}} 19.44 parsecs gives an absolute <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> 2.42, {{as compared to the}} Sun, which has an absolute <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> 4.83. This corresponds to a visual luminosity 9.2 times greater than that of the Sun. When the entire spectrum of radiation from Beta Pictoris and the Sun is taken into account, Beta Pictoris is found to be 8.7 times more luminous than the Sun.|$|E

5|$|Beta Pictoris {{is a star}} in the {{southern}} constellation of Pictor, the Easel, and is located {{to the west of the}} bright star Canopus. It traditionally marked the sounding line of the ship Argo Navis, before the constellation was split. The star has an apparent visual <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> 3.861, so is visible to the naked eye under good conditions, though light pollution may result in stars dimmer than magnitude 3 being too dim to see. It is the second brightest in its constellation, exceeded only by Alpha Pictoris, which has an apparent <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> 3.30.|$|E
5|$|Beta, Delta and Kappa are {{multiple}} star systems containing six, two and four stars respectively. Located near {{the tail of}} the toucan, Beta Tucanae's two brightest components, Beta1 and Beta2 are separated by an angle of 27 arcseconds and have apparent magnitudes of 4.4 and 4.5 respectively. They can be separated in small telescopes. A third star, Beta3 Tucanae, is separated by 10 arcminutes from the two, and able {{to be seen as a}} separate star with the unaided eye. Each star is itself a binary star, making six in total. Lying in the southwestern corner of the constellation around 251 light-years away from Earth, Delta Tucanae consists of a blue-white primary contrasting with a yellowish companion. Delta Tucanae A is a main sequence star of spectral type B9.5V and an apparent <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> 4.49. The companion has an apparent <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> 9.3. The Kappa Tucanae system shines with a combined apparent <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> 4.25, and is located around 68 light-years from the Solar System. The brighter component is a yellowish star, known as Kappa Tucanae A with an apparent <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> 5.33 and spectral type F6V, while the fainter lies 5 arcseconds to the northwest. Known as Kappa Tucanae B, it has an apparent <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> 7.58 and spectral type K1V. Five arcminutes to the northwest is a fainter star of apparent magnitude 7.24 —actually a pair of orange main sequence stars of spectral types K2V and K3V, which can be seen individually as stars one arcsecond apart with a telescope such as a Dobsonian with high power.|$|E
