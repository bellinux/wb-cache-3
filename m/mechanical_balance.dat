40|$|International audienceControlling the part's {{balance of}} {{crankshafts}} {{is an important}} issue for automobile manufacturers. Unbalance measurement is carried out, in general, with high-precision <b>mechanical</b> <b>balancing</b> machines. Each model of crankshaft requires a specialized <b>mechanical</b> <b>balancing</b> machine. We propose a new solution for balancing crankshafts by replacing mechanical measuring systems with a non-contact digitizing system, which allows the acquisition of a representative 3 D point cloud of the crankshaft surface. The Voxel 2 inertia method is proposed to convert 3 D scanned point clouds into a voxel-based representation and to calculate the inertia matrix and the unbalance vectors. Theoretical CAD models are used to determinate the best setting for mesh and voxelization. Several levels of error are introduced on CAD models in order to estimate the necessary scanning quality, and thus define the appropriate scanning system for balancing measurements. The Voxel 2 inertia algorithm is validated on three different crankshaft models that were scanned with the most appropriate digitizing system. The results highlight that this new approach for determining unbalance vectors from scanned data is suitable for replacing the current mechanical measuring systems. This technology can make the production lines more flexible and more adaptable for future changes...|$|R

50|$|An inline six {{engine is}} in {{practically}} perfect {{primary and secondary}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>balance,</b> {{without the use of}} a balance shaft. The engine is in primary couple balance because the front and rear trio of cylinders are mirror images, and the pistons move in pairs (but of course, 360° out of phase and on different strokes of the 4-stroke cycle). That is, piston #1 mirrors #6, #2 mirrors #5, and #3 mirrors #4, largely eliminating the polar rocking motion that would otherwise result.|$|E

This method {{can be used to}} determine the feasibility of replacing the traditional <b>mechanical</b> <b>balancing</b> operations, used to adjust the resonant frequency, by displacement feedback and for determining the velocity feedback required to produce a particular bandwidth. Experiments were performed on a cylindrical resonator with discrete piezoelectric actuation and sensing elements to demonstrate the principles. Good agreement between analysis and experiment was obtained, and it was shown that this type of resonator could be bal-anced by displacement feedback.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, a new custom 4130 chromoly frame helped address {{a lot of}} the visual balance issues and {{accommodated}} solutions to {{a lot of the}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>balance</b> issues. The heat shielding issues were solved and the large polished aluminum radiator was dressed up with a chrome fan and shroud, although some remove the shroud and prefer the more raw and muscular look. The radiator is still the Boss Hoss's weakest aesthetic feature, but there has been vast improvement. The 2006 models dress up the enormous radiator as well as or better than the much smaller radiators of other high-volume manufacturers.|$|E

The Watering Crane standing alongside the tracks was originally used as a water replenishing point for steam locomotives. Worker's huts and accommodation are also located within the yard; it is possible that both of these structures were erected in the 1920s as part of the station yard re- organisation. These huts at present are in use as accommodation as shunters and train examiners shelters. At the Eastern edge of the shunting yard a <b>mechanical</b> <b>balance</b> scale is still extant, housed in a weighbridge shelter shed. The weighbridge balance scale bears a foundry plate marker on it. Slide balances were used to measure wagon weights for train marshalling.|$|E
50|$|In December 1969, Seiko {{produced}} the world's first commercial quartz wristwatch, the Astron. This watch was released {{just prior to}} the introduction of the Swiss Beta21, which was developed by 16 Swiss Watch manufactures and used by Rolex, Patek and famously Omega in their electroquartz models. The Beta 21 watches had an accuracy of 5 seconds per month but were swiftly overtaken by the introduction of more economical and accurate quartz watches. The inherent accuracy and low cost of production has resulted in the proliferation of quartz clocks and watches since that time. By the 1980s, quartz technology had taken over applications such as kitchen timers, alarm clocks, bank vault time locks, and time fuzes on munitions, from earlier <b>mechanical</b> <b>balance</b> wheel movements, an upheaval known in watchmaking as the quartz crisis.|$|E

This paper introduces new balancing principles (different from those of Archimedes) including a balance-revolution principle and double equilibrium, that go much further. They yield a host of surprising relations involving both volumes and surface areas of circumsolids of revolution, as well as higher-dimensional spheres, cylindroids, spherical wedges, and cylindrical wedges. The concept of cylindroid, introduced here, is crucial for extending to higher dimensions Archimedes’ classical relations on the sphere and cylinder. We also provide remarkable new results for centroids of hemispheres in n-space. Throughout the paper, we adhere to Archimedes’ style of reducing properties of complicated objects to those of simpler objects...|$|R

5000|$|An H engine can {{be viewed}} as two flat engines, one atop or beside the other. The [...] "two engines" [...] each have their own crankshaft, which are then geared {{together}} at one end for power-take-off. The H configuration allows the building of multi-cylinder engines that are shorter than the alternatives, sometimes delivering advantages on aircraft. For race-car applications there is the disadvantage of a higher centre of gravity, not only because one crankshaft is located atop the other, but also because the engine must be high enough off the ground to allow clearance underneath for a row of exhaust pipes. The power-to-weight ratio is not as good as simpler configurations employing one crankshaft. There is excellent <b>mechanical</b> <b>balance,</b> especially desirable and otherwise difficult to achieve in a four-cylinder engine.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} {{various forms of}} osmotic {{transport}} in the regime of high solute concentration. We consider both the osmosis across membranes and diffusio-osmosis at solid interfaces, driven by solute concentration gradients. We follow a mechanical {{point of view of}} osmotic transport, which allows us to gain much insight into the local <b>mechanical</b> <b>balance</b> underlying osmosis. We demonstrate in particular how the general expression of the osmotic pressure for mixtures, as obtained classically from the thermodynamic framework, emerges from the <b>mechanical</b> <b>balance</b> controlling non-equilibrium transport under solute gradients. Expressions for the rejection coefficient of osmosis and the diffusio-osmotic mobilities are accordingly obtained. These results generalize existing ones in the dilute solute regime to mixtures with arbitrary concentrations. Comment: Accepted for publication in the Journal of Chemical Physic...|$|E

40|$|A {{general theory}} of {{thermodynamically}} consistent biomechanical [...] biochemical growth in a body, considering mass addition in the bulk and at an incoherent interface, is developed. The incoherency arises due to incompatibility of growth and elastic distortion tensors at the interface. The incoherent interface therefore acts as an additional source of internal stress besides allowing for rich growth kinematics. All the biochemicals in the model are essentially represented by nutrient concentration fields, in the bulk and at the interface. A nutrient balance law is postulated which, combined with <b>mechanical</b> <b>balances</b> and kinetic laws, yields an initial-boundary-value problem coupling the evolution of bulk and interfacial growth, on one hand, {{and the evolution of}} growth and nutrient concentration on the other.

40|$|The present paper {{shows the}} {{influence}} of streamlines curvature on pressure and velocity distribution in an incompressible, non viscous, fluid motion. A radial, axially-symmetric case is analyzed. A Stokes streamfunction expansion is theoretically derived, which put into evidence the detachment of the solution from the elementary one, when the ‘shallowness’ parameter (depth scale to length scale ratio) is not vanishing. The influence of shallowness on the integral dynamical quantities, such as total linear momentum and total angular momentum, is shown, and the closure of integral <b>mechanical</b> <b>balances</b> is discussed. The behaviour of the solution at the second order is described; in any case, the method remains valid for an arbitrary requested order of accuracy.
