2500|$|In 2001 Csodálatos Pókember was relaunched, {{but instead}} of {{carrying}} on with the Spider-Man continuity, it served a younger audience with the translations of Ultimate Spider-Man. Leaving Kretén and the bimonthly Star Wars out of account, Semic Interprint shifted to the children's audience with other flagship titles such as Dragon Ball (cancelled soon after), Garfield, and Dörmögő Dömötör. [...] Children's comics were the <b>main</b> <b>profile</b> of major publishers like Egmont (Tom és Jerry, Donald Kacsa magazin) and smaller companies such as Abrafaxe Kft. (Mozaik - later continued by N-Press, than Ratius).|$|E

50|$|In a PSNR based {{performance}} comparison {{released in}} April 2013 the Main 10 profile {{was compared to}} the <b>Main</b> <b>profile</b> using a set of 3840×2160 10-bit video sequences. The 10-bit video sequences were converted to 8-bits for the <b>Main</b> <b>profile</b> and remained at 10-bits for the Main 10 profile. The reference PSNR {{was based on the}} original 10-bit video sequences. In the performance comparison the Main 10 profile provided a 5% bit rate reduction for inter frame video coding compared to the <b>Main</b> <b>profile.</b> The performance comparison states that for the tested video sequences the Main 10 profile outperformed the <b>Main</b> <b>profile.</b> The Main 10 profile was added at the October 2012 HEVC meeting based on proposal JCTVC-K0109 which proposed that a 10-bit profile be added to HEVC for consumer applications. The proposal stated that this was to allow for improved video quality and to support the Rec. 2020 color space that has become widely used in UHDTV systems {{and to be able to}} deliver higher dynamic range and color fidelity avoiding the banding artifacts. A variety of companies supported the proposal which included ATEME, BBC, BSkyB, CISCO, DirecTV, Ericsson, Motorola Mobility, NGCodec, NHK, RAI, ST, SVT, Thomson Video Networks, Technicolor, and ViXS Systems.|$|E

50|$|The MPEG-2 Part 7 {{standard}} (Advanced Audio Coding) {{was first}} published in 1997 and offers three default profiles: Low Complexity profile (LC), <b>Main</b> <b>profile</b> and Scalable Sampling Rate profile (SSR).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Main</b> <b>Profile</b> (MP): Originally {{intended}} as the mainstream consumer profile for broadcast and storage applications, {{the importance of}} this profile faded when the High profile (HiP) was developed for those applications.|$|E
