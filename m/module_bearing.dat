50|$|The {{adventure}} module The Village of Hommlet was a 24-page booklet {{designed by}} Gary Gygax, {{and published by}} TSR in 1979. The original printing featured an outer folder and a two-color cover; the book was reprinted in 1981 with a color cover. The Temple of Elemental Evil was originally intended to bear the module code T2 {{and serve as a}} true sequel to The Village of Hommlet. Gygax began writing T2 soon after the publication of T1, but often stopped to work on other products, such as The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth (Gygax 1981). The T2 version was never completed, and no <b>module</b> <b>bearing</b> the codes T3 or T4 was ever independently published. Instead, the material for the sequel was combined in 1985 with the original T1 storyline and published as an integrated adventure bearing the module code T1-4.|$|E
40|$|The dbl {{oncogene}} product (onco-Dbl) is {{the prototype}} {{member of a}} family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rho GTPases. The Dbl homology (DH) domain of onco-Dbl is responsible for the GEF catalytic activity, and the DH domain, together with the immediately adjacent pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, constitutes the minimum <b>module</b> <b>bearing</b> transforming function. In the present study, we demonstrate that the onco-Dbl protein exists in oligomeric form in vitro and in cells. The oligomerization is mostly homophilic in nature and is mediated by the DH domain. Mutagenesis studies mapped the region involved in oligomerization to the conserved region 2 of the DH domain, which is located at {{the opposite side of the}} Rho GTPase interacting surface. Residue His 556 of this region, in particular, is important for this activity, since the H 556 A mutant retained the GEF catalytic capability and the binding activity toward Cdc 42 and RhoA in vitro but was deficient in oligomer formation. Consequently, the Rho GTPase activating potential of the H 556 A mutant was significantly reduced in cells. The focus-forming and anchorage-independent growth activities of onco-Dbl were completely abolished by the His 556 -to-Ala mutation, whereas the abilities to stimulate cell growth, activate Jun N-terminal kinase, and cause actin cytoskeletal changes were retained by the mutant. The ability of onco-Dbl to oligomerize allowed multiple Rho GTPases to be recruited to the same signaling complex, and such an ability is defective in the H 556 A mutant. Taken together, these results suggest that oligomerization of onco-Dbl through the DH domain is essential for cellular transformation by providing the means to generate a signaling complex that further augments and/or coordinates its Rho GTPase activating potential...|$|E

Using uracilic N- 3 -BOC-protected modules, it has been possible to thermally trigger the self-assembly/self-organization process of the two molecular modules, inducing the formation of objects on a mica surface that exhibit crater-like morphology and a very homogeneous size distribution. Confirmation {{of the presence of}} the hydrogen-bonding-driven self-assembly/self-organization process in solution was obtained by variable-temperature (VT) steady-state UV-vis absorption and emission measurements. The variation of the geometric and spatial features of the morphologies was monitored at different T by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM) and was interpreted by a nonequilibrium diffusion model for two chemical species in solution. The formation of nanostructures turned out to be affected by the solid substrate (molecular interactions at a solid-liquid interface), by the matter-momentum transport in solution (solute diffusivity D- 0 and solvent kinematic viscosity nu), and the thermally dependent cleavage reaction of the BOC functions (T-dependent differential weight loss, theta = theta(T)) in a T interval extrapolated to similar to 60 K. A scaling function, f = T(nu D- 0, nu/D- 0, theta), relying on the onset condition of a concentration-driven thermosolutal instability has been established to simulate the T-dependent behavior of the structural dimension (i. e., height and radius) of the self-organized nanostructures as approximate to f(T) and approximate to 1 /f (T) ...|$|R

Indeed, genome-wide comparative genomics, using alignments between reference assemblies has allowed the identification of regulatory elements and functional <b>modules</b> <b>bearing</b> the signatures of adaptation and/or purifying selection in the lineages of various species, particularly humans and great apes. In the present study, we took a two-pronged approach: First, we focused on the coding regions of genes in four functional modules reported to be enriched with genes presenting signatures of different type s of selection in the human and chimpanzee lineages. These modules are complement and coagulation ca scade (with genes under positive selection), regulation of actin cytoskeleton (under purifying selection) and two KEGG pathways of common human neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson, with no clear trends of selection. Second, we studied regulatory regions aroun d these genes, including introns, UTRs, miRNA, lncRNA, promoters (5 kb) and trailers (5 kb).

Further, the use of lightweight telescopes for obvious economic benefits burdens the requirement for stable support and rotation. Conventional contact bearings and gear drives have numerous failure modes under such a restrictive and harsh environment. However, hybrid superconducting magnetic bearings (HSMB) fit in naturally. These bearings are stable, light, passive, and essentially frictionlesa, allowing high precision electronic positioning control.

40|$|The LDL {{receptor}} internalizes circulating LDL and VLDL particles for degradation. Its extracellular binding domain contains ten (seven LA {{and three}} EGF) cysteine-rich <b>modules,</b> each <b>bearing</b> three disulfide bonds. Despite the {{enormous number of}} disulfide combinations possible, LDLR oxidative folding leads to a single native species with 30 unique intradomain disulfides. Previous folding studies of the LDLR have shown that non native disulfides are initially formed that lead to compact species. Accordingly, the folding of the LDLR {{has been described as}} a "coordinated nonvectorial" reaction, and it has been proposed that early compaction funnels the reaction toward the native structure. Here we analyze the oxidative folding of LA 4 and LA 5, the modules critical for ApoE binding, isolated and in the LA 45 tandem. Compared to LA 5, LA 4 folding is slow and inefficient, resembling that of LA 5 disease-linked mutants. Without Ca++, it leads to a mixture of many two-disulfide scrambled species and, with Ca++, to the native form plus two three-disulfide intermediates. The folding of the LA 45 tandem seems to recapitulate that of the individual repeats. Importantly, although the folding of the LA 45 tandem takes place through formation of scrambled isomers, no interdomain disulfides are detected, i. e. the two adjacent modules fold independently without the assistance of interdomain covalent interactions. Reduction of incredibly large disulfide combinatorial spaces, such as that in the LDLR, by intradomain confinement of disulfide bond formation might be also essential for the efficient folding of other homologous disulfide-rich receptors...|$|R

40|$|A {{major issue}} in current Higher Education {{practice}} {{is the development of}} employability skills within the graduate community. Reports from Sector Skills Councils, such as e-skills UK [1], highlight employer concern at the ability of new graduates to make an effective contribution in the workplace with any immediacy. Various projects have been developed looking at academic-employer engagement, internship schemes, and various placement models, all of which have had some beneficial effect. The University of Greenwich School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences (CMS) has developed a new vehicle for this activity, called GWizards, which seeks to re-engage the university with the local community. In particular, this involves working directly with all types of organisation to identify project activities of mutual benefit. This mutual benefit is determined by opportunities for students to gain experience in the workplace, organisations to gain practical technical help for little or no cost, and academic staff to gain project experience and publishing opportunities. To facilitate this process, CMS has developed credit <b>bearing</b> <b>modules</b> on its programmes that link to these employability opportunities, so students have the chance to follow directly relevant project work within their academic studies to earn academic credits for practical work, and also to be engaged in the management and control of these activities both internally and externally to the university within a student-run company structure. This company will operate within GWizards in a standard enterprise structure, run by a student executive board responsible for hiring and firing student employees and all enterprise operational activities, and will take on internal and external contracts on a professional basis. The information related to these activities will be reported and recorded in an active portfolio [2], maintained electronically by the student, who will also take the responsibility to collect evidence of their activities, in terms of customer report and feedback, prototype or service development reports, and academic supervisor feedback. This active portfolio provides the fundamental information for a technically detailed CV, describing the students’ knowledge and experience in terms of employability skills, while also providing the academic evidence necessary for the application of credits towards degree study...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Electronical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. The McTronX {{research}} group has conducted extensive research concerning Active Magnetic Bearings (AMBs). This research involved {{the establishment of}} an advanced AMB laboratory to aid in assisting industries that implement AMBs in their applications. This year the McTronX group’s focus shifted toward the development of an AMB system to be implemented in the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR). The AMB system was designed to be used in a helium blower application. This involved the development of both the mechanical and the electronic components. The main goal of this AMB system was to develop a completely digital integrated controller which is responsible for the control of the AMB system, from here on referred to as the AMB drive and electronic system (ADES). The need arose for a totally digital system to increase the reliability and robustness of the ADES. These requirements are crucial in a nuclear environment. In order to develop a totally digital system a new issue had to be addressed. This involved the implementation of digital communication. This project involved the development of a communication sub‐system for the ADES. The communication system was divided into two sections, the internal and external communication system. The various interfaces were identified as well as their specifications formulated. The optimum solution was then selected for each of the interfaces by using a design process that involved comprehensive trade‐off studies. The external communication system and the internal communication system were specified and the necessary hardware was procured. An in‐house developed protocol was developed and implemented between the internal functional units of the ADES. The designed protocol adhered to the specific needs of an AMB application. The protocol was extensively tested by carrying out verification and validation tests and evaluation plans. The test and evaluation plans for verification were carried out by making use of simulations and laboratory experiments. Validation of the in‐house developed protocol was carried out by analyzing the internal communication system whilst the ADES was controlling the <b>bearing</b> <b>module.</b> During this phase the communication system was also subjected to error conditions. The protocol proved to be completely functional, robust and reliable, meeting the performance specifications and the requirements.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} how to construct a system to measure load in a mobile unicompartmental knee replacement (UKR) bearing. In vivo loads have been measured in a total knee replacement (TKR), but with TKR the kinematics {{are different from those}} of the normal knee, whereas they are close to normal in a mobile UKR, so the loads measured by an instrumented UKR would be more representative of the normal knee. On the principle of measuring compression of an object under load, the load may be estimated. Compression measurement using a capacitive sensor was the optimal solution to measure load, based on life expectancy of the sensor and bearing integrity. A capacitive sensor within a polyethylene (UHMWPE) bearing has not been used before. The visco-elastic and temperature dependent properties of UHMWPE were determined with experiments. UHMWPE had an approximately linear response after ten minutes of applying a constant load. A temperature sensor should be used in vivo to compensate for temperature effects acting on the elastic modulus of UHMWPE. Finite element modelling demonstrated that positioning the sensor under the centre of the bearing concavity resulted in the largest capacitive change. The influence of various dimensional parameters on sensor output was simulated, and the conclusion was that the sensor only needs to be calibrated once. An electronic module inserted into a bearing had less than 5 % influence on bearing compression. Capacitive sensors were made from polyimide, using standard production methods, and embedded within a UKR bearing using the standard compression moulding process. The embedded sensor had a second order low pass frequency response, with a corner frequency of 9 Hz, twice the frequency required for typical functional loading such as gait. Physiological load signals, gait and step up/down, were applied to the bearing. The capacitance to load response was approximately linear. Load was estimated using a linear method and a dynamic method. The linear method performed best, with an accuracy of force estimation better than 90 %. In vitro tests were performed using a commercially available transceiver, two stan- dard antennas and a custom antenna, designed to be incorporated in the bearing. Wireless communication between an implanted custom antenna and an external an- tenna was shown to be feasible. Experiments were also performed that demonstrate that inductive powering of the bearing was feasible. In addition to load measurement, a proposal for dynamic measurement of the orien- tation angles of both the tibia and the femur was made. Power and volume calculations showed that it is possible to place an electronic <b>module</b> within the <b>bearing.</b> This thesis has not only demonstrated that it is feasible to make an instrumented bearing for UKR but has also provided a basic design for manufacturing.
