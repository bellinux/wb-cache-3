40|$|This paper {{develops}} a general equilibrium, continuous time model where portfolio constraints generate <b>mispricing</b> <b>between</b> redundant securities. Constrained consumption-portfolio optimization techniques are adapted to incorporate redundant, possibly mispriced, securities. Under logarithmic preferences, we provide explicit conditions for mispricing and closed-form expressions for all economic quantities. Existence of an equilibrium where mispricing occurs with positive probability is verified {{in a specific}} case. In a more general setting, we demonstrate the necessity of mispricing for equilibrium when agents are heterogeneous enough. The construction of a representative agent with stochastic weights allows us to characterize prices and allocations, given mispricing occurs. ...|$|R

Unearned endowed wealth, the standard practice in experimental studies of asset price bubbles, may elicit greater than normal risk-seeking behavior. We test for this altered behavior by requiring some participants to earn their initial market allocation. We do not find {{a significant difference in}} the frequency, severity, or duration of <b>mispricing</b> <b>between</b> earned and unearned endowments.

This suggests that information processing constraints force the periodic neglect of one of the assets, thereby causing substantial, albeit temporary, mispricing in this simple asset market. © 2013 Royal Economic Society...|$|R

40|$|We study {{risk and}} return {{properties}} of capital structure arbitrage strategies aiming {{to profit from}} temporal <b>mispricing</b> <b>between</b> equity and credit default swaps (CDSs) of companies. We find that capital structure arbitrage provides an attractive annualized return of 24. 35 % on invested capital. The arbitrage returns are higher for lower rated companies and surprisingly they are also higher for more liquid companies with larger CDS trading volumes. We find {{that the number of}} arbitrage trade opportunities can at times cluster and in our sample the concentration of trades occurs when they are most profitable, which highlights the issue of capital allocation. Constructing weekly return indices of capital structure arbitrage, we find that no more than 15 % of the returns is explained by common risk factors...|$|R
40|$|We report {{results from}} an asset market experiment, {{in which we}} {{investigate}} the relationship between traders’ risk aversion, loss aversion, and cognitive ability and their trading behavior and market outcomes. Greater average risk aversion {{on the part of}} traders in the market predicts lower market prices. The greater the level of loss aversion of the trader cohort, the lower the quantity traded. The greater the average cognitive reflection test score, the smaller the differences between market prices and fundamental values. Different treatments enable us to study how the time path of the fundamental value trajectory affects the level of adherence to fundamentals. We compare the level of <b>mispricing</b> <b>between</b> decreasing and increasing fundamental value trajectories.

Therefore the study looks beyond systematic reasons extensively examined in prior research. It is found that trading activity is higher for single stock futures on stock characterized by low institutional ownership, and high volume on spot market. The <b>mispricing</b> <b>between</b> spot and futures market also attracts investors to single stock futures market. Moreover the factors, such as a size of contract, tick size and age of contract on particular stock significantly contribute to increase open interest and traded volume. Furthermore, evidences are found that single stock futures become more efficiently priced around ex-dividend date for underlying stock.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{predictive}} {{power of the}} CDS-bond basis for future corporate bond returns. We find that residual basis, {{the part of the}} CDS-bond basis that cannot be explained by a wide range of market frictions such as counterparty risk, funding risk, and liquidity risk, strongly negatively predicts excess returns. Controlling for systematic risk factors, including credit risk and liquidity risk, we find that a bond portfolio formed on the residual basis generates a significant abnormal bond return of 1. 79 % at the 20 -day horizon. The abnormal returns due to the residual basis reflect mispricing rather than missing systematic risk factors. These results are robust to different horizons and sample periods and to the various characteristics of bonds. Overall, our results imply a beneficial role of CDS in the bond market as the existence of <b>mispricing</b> <b>between</b> CDS and bonds results in a subsequent price convergence in bonds...|$|R

This research uses multi-period Geske structural models by Chen and Yeh (2006) to estimate the default probabilities and CDS spread, and make arbitrage for 369 North American obligors. The empirical result showed that, there are indeed a negative relationship between CDS spread and equity market, and the speculative-grade obligors is more profitable than investment-grade obligors.

40|$|Asset prices {{depend on}} two elements: the {{dynamics}} of the state variables and the pricing kernel. Traditional term structure models differ in the factor dynamics. However, most of them imply a log-linear pricing kernel. We investigate empirically the role of factor dynamics and pricing kernel in pricing interest rate derivatives using a nonparametric approach. We find that the prices of interest rate caps are very sensitive to the specification of the factor dynamics, especially when they are close to expiration. In addition, nonlinear log-pricing kernels improve the pricing of long-maturity caps. Recent research document models that fit libor and swap rates but do not price derivatives well, leading to the so called “unspanned stochastic volatility puzzle”. Additional factors seem to be needed to explain cap prices. However, the <b>relative</b> <b>mispricing</b> <b>between</b> interest rate caps and underlying libor and swap rates could also potentially be due to mis-specification of the parametric models used. Our paper provides evidence, from a nonparametric perspective, for the inability of diffusion-only type of models to price interest rate caps. Models with jumps such as that in Jarrow, Li, and Zhao (JF, forthcoming) is needed to explain the prices of libor options...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the risk and}} return of the so-called capital structure arbitrage, which exploits the <b>mispricing</b> <b>between</b> a companys debt and equity. SpeciÞcally, a structural model connects a companys equity price with its credit default swap (CDS) spread. Based on the deviation of CDS market quotes from their theoretical counterparts, a convergence-type trading strategy is proposed and analyzed using 4, 044 daily CDS spreads on 33 obligors. We Þnd that capital structure arbitrage can be an attractive investment strategy, but {{is not without its}} risk. In particular, the risk arises when the arbitrageur shorts CDS and the market spread subsequently skyrockets, resulting in market closure and forcing the arbitrageur into liquidation. We present preliminary evidence that the monthly return from capital structure arbitrage is related to the corporate bond market return and a hedge fund return index on Þxed income arbitrage. Capital structure arbitrage has lately become popular among hedge funds and bank proprietary trading desks. Some traders have even touted it as the next big thing or the hottest strategy in the arbitrage community.

The {{reason for this is that}} although limited dispersal increases the relatedness between interacting individuals, it also leads to increased local competition for resources <b>between</b> <b>relatives.</b> This result supports Taylor's prediction that in the simplest possible scenario, the effects of increased relatedness and local competition exactly cancel out.
