40|$|Dairy {{production}} has presented in Vietnam since 50 years, but these dairy farms really developed from 2001. In the period 2001 – 2010, the average {{growth rate of}} dairy herds was up to 30 % per year. However, fresh milk production satisfies about 20 - 25 % of milk consumption. The rural areas of Hanoi Province are large for dairy production. This province builds the 7 agro-ecological sub-regions {{for the development of}} dairy farming, in which Ba Vi District is a most of sub-regions for dairy production development. But the average size is about 2. 5 cows per farm. This research aims to better understand how the factors in milk sector adapt to current economic conditions in Hanoi suburbs through analyzing farming systems. These studies were conducted from January to August 2012 on 43 dairy farms with different production scales at Ba Vi District to characteristic of dairy farming systems. The data were collected by interviewing and keeping records at the farms that have milk production. The results showed that three dairy production systems in these zones: (1) Dairy small farming system has from 1 to 3 cows per farm; (2) The <b>medium</b> <b>farming</b> system has from 4 to 5 cows per farm; and (3) The dairy intensive farming system has more 5 cows per farm. The economic activities were really diversified with landless per household farm such as rice production, gardens, grass production and sylviculture. Land resources per farm of intensive farming system were largest including 9, 239 m² for garden around the household; 2, 574 m² for rice land; 563 m² of grass area and 3, 325 m² for sylviculture. While the small farming system has the lowest potential land, each household has only 2, 815 m² of garden; 1, 795 m² of rice land; 2, 095 m² of grazing land. The <b>medium</b> <b>farming</b> system has about 3, 150 m² of garden; 2, 220 m² of rice land and 3, 891 m² of grazing land. Milk production cycle was quite long with intensive farming system, up to 324 days comparing with 299 days per cycle with <b>medium</b> <b>farming</b> system and to 306 days per cycle with small-scale farmers. This difference was not statistically signification (P> 0. 05). Average milk production yield per cow was high with <b>medium</b> <b>farming</b> system (16 kg per cow per day) in comparison with 15 kg per day at intensive and small farming systems (P> 0. 05). Milk production yield has been improved in the past years with crossbreed cows such as Holstein-Friesian 50 % and 75 %. But this productivity was still considered to be lower than the milk production yield with dairy cows raised in Moc Chau District under Son La Province with 20. 5 kg per cow per day and 6, 250 kg of milk per cow per cycle). In addition, in the period from 2006 to 2012, fresh milk prices at farm gate have continued to rise for the farmers, while feed prices increased in the period from 2006 to 2010 and these feed prices were stable between 2011 and 2012. In the period of 2006 to 2012, fresh milk prices at farm gate increased from 0. 17 USD per kg in 2006 to 0. 60 USD per kg in 2012 and feed prices were from 0. 15 USD per kg in 2006 increasing to 0. 39 USD per kg in 2012. The net incomes were calculated per a cow per year reached 1, 274 USD with the small-scale farming households to 1, 476 USD with <b>medium</b> <b>farming</b> system. The net income per kg of fresh milk at farm gate obtained from 0. 28 USD with small farming system to 0. 31 USD with <b>medium</b> <b>farming</b> system. The net household income was high from dairy production, from 2, 437 USD per farm per year with small farming system to 5, 487 USD per farm per year with intensive farming system. The net labor family income gained from 997 USD per active per year with small farming system to 2, 757 USD per active per year with intensive farming system. Thus, dairy production farms in recent years in Hanoi Suburbs provide very high economic efficiency for farmers in comparison with other agricultural activities at the farms. This explains why the rate of dairy family farming has grown very fast in the studied zones in the period from 2009 to 2012. This trend will continue to grow in the future.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the management and economic success of beef production by three types of farm in northwestern Vietnam. The potential of household farms to supply beef for the market and their competition with large farms were examined. The fieldwork was done in 2007 on 73 farms consisting of 58 small mixed farms (small <b>farms),</b> 10 <b>medium</b> mixed <b>farms</b> (<b>medium</b> <b>farms)</b> and 5 specialised large-scale beef farms (large farms) in Son La province. The three types of farm differed in ethnicity (Thai, H'mong, and Kinh), remoteness (lowland, highland), production objectives (subsistence, market output), degree of specialization (mixed farm, specialised beef farm) and integration of production (single farmers, cooperative). Data on biological productivity, inputs and outputs, and the social contribution of cattle production were collected by household and key person interviews, participatory rural appraisal tools and cattle body measurements. Economic values were derived by assessment of market or replacement costs. Quantitative data analysis was done with linear models (PROC GLM) in the SAS software (version 9. 1). Lowland small farms had higher costs for cattle production than the highland farms (0. 8 Â Mill. Â VNDÂ head- 1 Â year- 1 compared with 0. 02 Â Mill. Â VNDÂ head- 1 Â year- 1, respectively). The large farms had high production costs, with an average of 2. 5 - 3. 6 Â Mill. Â VNDÂ head- 1 Â year- 1. Cattle brought high benefits of non-cash values to the household farms. The total revenue from cattle was in the range 4. 5 - 11. 5 Â Mill. Â VNDÂ head- 1 Â year- 1, which depended on the use of non-market functions of cattle on the household farm. The value of net benefit/kg live weight (LW) of lowland small farms with an average of 39, 000 Â VND/kg LW was significantly higher than that of the <b>medium</b> and small <b>farms</b> in the highlands (26, 000 Â VND/kg LW). However, the small farms kept fewer cattle than the <b>medium</b> <b>farms</b> (average of 2 - 4 cattle/farm compared with 9 cattle/farm, respectively) because of forage and labour shortages and have no option to further develop cattle production. Keeping larger numbers of cattle based on available natural pasture brought high benefit from stock value as farm liquidity to only the <b>medium</b> <b>farms.</b> This was the most promising type of farm for future development of beef production, given its actual success and the availability of underutilised resources. Large-scale farms suffered high economic losses of 0. 3 - 1. 4 Â Mill.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Farmers ’ {{livelihood}} in the midlands of {{the northern}} part of Vietnam relies mainly on crop production and livestock rearing. Green manure and animal dung are commonly used for crops, particularly in rice culture- a staple food crop, and sugarcane- a cash crop. Due to the small-scale livestock systems, the animal dung is limited, which results farmers in preferring a smaller sugarcane cultivation area. This research study was to investigate and to optimize the effect of animal and green manures and their combination together with heat-compost technique on the improvement of the quality of organic manure, soil fertility and yield in three farm categories. The study revealed that the farmers in the small, medium and large farm categories should raise livestock up to 4 pigs and 3 buffaloes, 7 pig and 5 buffaloes, and 20 pigs and 13 buffaloes, respectively to match with the available resources. The optimized livestock herd holding and sugarcane cultivation area resulted in 88. 7 % increase of the return from livestock and 62. 5 % from crops in the small farm size, 25 % from livestock and 9 % from crops in the <b>medium</b> <b>farm</b> size and 171 % from livestock while unchanged from crops in the large farm size...|$|E

Furthermore, three scenarios are proposed to assess the system configuration according to its impact on both technical and economic balance of the farm. It is found that under the specific climatic conditions of the studied location, the three optimized systems satisfy the typical farm load of 18 kWh per day. The second scenario optimized system meets the requirement of paying back the total costs of system investment during the system's lifetime and the third scenario optimized system enhances the grid reliability by decreasing the power grid peak load by 70 kW and feeding to the grid 119 MWh annually...|$|E

We have found, however, that in 1972,-and still in 1980, though tubewells were {{owned by a}} minor fraction of total farm households (and predominantly by the large and medium farmers), they were used by a substantial proportion of farm households. Predictably, the user-owner ratio was {{the highest in the}} case of the small farmers in all provinces. The relative importance of the small and medium farmers as owners of this technology increased over the period, particularly in the Punjab where tubewells are concentrated. The development of a hire market in tubewell services has given birth to a new entrepreneurial class in the rural areas. Inequalities in rural income are dwindling and benefits emanating from new technology are shared. These conclusions are of vital importance because they negate the existing views and show that CO the indivisibility of technology has not been a barrier to its adoption, and that (ii) the fact that the share of the small and medium farmers in the ownership of tubewells has increased gives support to the thesis that if a technology is profitable, farmers will adopt it where possible.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the rural land and labour {{markets in the}} context of economic liberalization in India. Land and labour are the two fundamental resources available to the rural people for income generation. The access to land and to employment for labour become basic determinants of well-being for the rural households. Reforms are often seen as hostile to rural areas and the poor, although they should be beneficial not only for overall growth, but also rural growth and poverty alleviation. The study based on primary household data {{examines the}} land and labour markets in the reform period and the underlying linkages of these to different characteristics of the household. The study finds that over the reform period in India the land markets are leading to less landlessness rather than more, and growth in marginal and <b>medium</b> <b>farm</b> sizes rather than large. Lease markets are leading to operated land in more hands. Land purchase behaviour is related to less land, more education, greater crop diversification, and higher crop and livestock revenues. Leasing-in is also related to many of the same variables and is showing great diversity in lease agreements involving outputs, inputs and rent. Labour-employment is showing diversity of occupations but the primary dependence on agriculture is still about 80 percent. There has been some change in the occupational structure. Non-farm employment is associated with higher overall employment. Own-farm employment is strongly related to crop diversification and livestock activity; other farm employment to number of male and female family members and irrigation; and non-farm employment to education. Broadly, liberalization does not show adverse consequences but rather some positive impact on rural land and labour markets. ...|$|E

Data were collected from 400 farmers (200 farmers from each farming system) for the crop year 2005 - 06. Technical, allocative and economic efficiency scores wereestimated by a non-parametric data envelopment analysis procedure. Technical, allocative and economic inefficiency scores were separately regressed on socio-economic and farm specific variables to identify the sources of technical, allocative and economic inefficiency using a Tobit regression model. The mean technical, allocative and economic efficiency calculated for the cottonwheat system was 0. 75, 0. 44 and 0. 37, respectively. Results of the study revealed that if sample farms in cotton-wheat system operated at full efficiency level they could reduce their input use by 25 percent and cost of production by 56 percent without reducing the level of output and with the same technology. Decomposition of technical efficiency into pure and scale efficiency revealed that small farms were pure technically more efficient than large and <b>medium</b> <b>farms.</b> Scale inefficiency was found to account for a larger share of technical inefficiency on small <b>farms</b> than on <b>medium</b> and large <b>farms.</b> Small farms were found to be less allocatively efficient than <b>medium</b> and large <b>farms.</b> The mean technical, allocative and economic efficiency of the sample farms in rice-wheat system was estimated at 0. 70, 0. 48 and 0. 40, respectively. These results implied that if sample farms in rice-wheat system operated at full efficiency levels they could reduce their input use by 30 percent and cost of production by 52 percent without any reduction in the level of output and with the existing technology. Decomposition of technical efficiency into pure and scale efficiency revealed that small farms were pure technically more efficient than large and <b>medium</b> <b>farms.</b> Pure technical efficiency of small, <b>medium</b> and large <b>farms</b> was 087, 0. 79 and 0. 81, respectively. Scale efficiency of small, <b>medium</b> and large <b>farms</b> was 079, 0. 94 and 0. 94, respectively. Small farms were found to be less allocatively efficient than <b>medium</b> and large <b>farms.</b> 2 Results of Tobit regression models showed that years of schooling and number of contacts with extension agents had negative impact on technical, allocative and economic inefficiency of both farming systems. Access to credit had negative impact on technical inefficiency of sample farms in cotton-wheat system. Impact of access to credit was negative on technical, allocative and economic inefficiency of rice-wheat system. It was found than those farms which were located close to the market were technically less inefficient than the farms located away from the markets. Sharecroppers were technically more inefficient than owner operators in both farming systems of Punjab...|$|R
40|$|The study {{conducted}} in the districts of Sonepat and Gurgaon in Haryana during the year 2003 - 04, has analysed the cost, returns and break-even point of mushroom production on different categories of farms, and has investigated the existing marketing system along with marketing cost, margins and marketing efficiency. Simple tabular analysis, benefit-cost analysis, break-even level, price spread and marketing efficiency {{have been used to}} draw the inference. The study has revealed that (i) the fixed capital investment is more than double in large and <b>medium</b> <b>farms</b> as compared to the small farms, (ii) the use of compost has a positive relationship with the farm size, (iii) there exists a positive relationship between mushroom production and farm size, (iv) large farmers have lowest cost of mushroom production as compared to small and <b>medium</b> <b>farms</b> due to efficient utilization of fixed farm resources, (v) the producer share in consumer rupee is highest in channel-IV, followed by channels II, III and I, respectively. The channel-I is the least efficient due to the existence of more middlemen. The study has suggested that (a) mushroom cultivation being capital-intensive, the financial assistance through institutional agencies at cheaper interest rate would be the desirable entity, (b) mushroom being a highly perishable crop and prone to high temperature, marketing infrastructures such as cold storage facilities are of immense importance. Similarly, suitable arrangements are needed by the canning/processing units for the management of surplus mushroom. Agricultural and Food Policy,...|$|R

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the current status}} of remote and proximal (on-ground) weed detection systems for site-specific weed management and discusses the limitations and opportunities of these technologies. Remote sensing based on multispectral aerial imagery can provide accurate weed maps, especially at late weed phenological stages, whereas images from high spatial resolution satellite and unmanned aerial vehicles must still be analysed. Hyperspectral images produce highly accurate maps at early and late phenological stages at a farm scale or medium spatial scale. However, this technology is not profitable, because of current operating costs, which are prohibitive. In studies of on-ground weed seedling detection, accurate results can be obtained at a <b>medium</b> <b>farm</b> scale. Despite numerous efforts, a powerful and flexible classifier of soil, weeds and crops in a number of situations, remains the greatest challenge of this technology. The main limitations of remote and proximal sensing may be summarised in the following two points: (i) the time and education required for applying new technological advances and (ii) the high cost of the technology and the lack of compatibility of the machinery. Possible solutions might include: (i) offering an advisory service that provides technical support, agronomic knowledge and specific training courses, (ii) {{the development and implementation of}} uniform and cheaper standards, (iii) increased research of both high resolution satellite imagery exploring object-based image analysis and pan-sharpened imagery and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and (iv) enabling the development of current prototypes of robotic weeding into commercial products. The general lack of multidisciplinary research groups can be a disadvantage when comparing the economic feasibility of site-specific weed management with conventional systems. © 2010 CSIC.

40|$|The general {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to develop profit-maximizing plans for a low income farm area and to indicate the magnitude of resource adjustment required to meet this optimum. The study set out to develop optimum plans for the individual farm units and for the area using the variable resource programming procedure. This procedure allowed the supply of a scarce resource to vary from zero to an unlimited amount. In this study capital was the resource allowed to vary. The area studied was a portion of the Broadview Rural Development Area in southeastern Saskatchewan. Only the section containing Oxbow-Ryerson soils was analyzed so that assumptions made with respect to one farm unit in the area would have some relevance to other farms in the area. The major source of information in connection with present farm production organization was obtained from a survey conducted in the area by the Saskatchewan Department of Agriculture in 1963. Another source of data was the Irrigation Budget Standards developed by the Department of Agricultural Economics at the University of Saskatchewan. Information was also taken from various research bulletins and the work of many Departments at the University of Saskatchewan. Three programs were conducted which developed optimum plans for three representative farm sizes at varying levels of capital use. Each program allowed a selected group of internal development alternatives to compete for the varying levels of scarce capital, thus assuring that a maximum profit position was attained. Various selected optimum farm plans thus derived were then used in an area model in order to determine a maximum development plan tor the area. Again capital was allowed to vary, with area net returns and farm unit organization indicated for each level of capital use. Two area programs were carried out. The first program allowed the area to develop a maximum profit position given a fixed farm unit size distribution in the area. The second program retained land as the only fixed resource in the model and developed a maximum profit position given this assumption. An additional program was conducted on the small farm in order to assess the competitive position of a land purchase alternative with that of the internal development measures available to the farm in the previous analysis. Another program was carried out on the <b>medium</b> <b>farm</b> to determine the extent to which development action would have to proceed in order to achieve specific minimum living standards at some time in the future. The results of the individual farm programs indicated that there is considerable income development potential for these farms through internal measures alone. The most significant possibility lies in the area of land clearing and breaking of arable bush and pasture land on the farms. In addition, the program results indicated a substantial development potential in the form of fertilizer use on cereal crops and in the form of a forage-cattle production combination. While these development alternatives added greatly to net returns for the farms, the profit increases were realized only through the use of large amounts of operating, intermediate and long term capital funds. The results of the area programs indicated the extent to which area net returns could be expanded given the various development alternatives and varying levels of capital use on the farms included in the area model. When farm numbers and size distribution were held constant, capital was utilized more profitably than when no restriction was placed on farm numbers. The maximum return to the area was reached at a higher number of farms using more capital and labour. Additional analysis of the small farm unit indicated the level of internal development necessary before land purchase became the most profitable alternative. Below that level the poor utilization of labour made internal develop­ment look more profitable. The final program involving the <b>medium</b> <b>farm</b> indicated the need for farm acreage expansion after intensification alternatives were exhausted in order to meet the higher living needs of the farmer in the future. The variable resource programming procedure appears well adapted to analysis of individual farm situations at a given point in time. The procedure was less useful in relating the dynamic elements in the development process. Further refinement of the area model is required. However, because the technique can be combined with electronic computers capable or handling large amounts of data, it should prove to be an invaluable aid in policy-making and in individual farm planning...|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} in the year 2008 - 2009 to estimate the farm-size-specific productivity and technical efficiency of all rice crops. Farm-size- specific technical efficiency scores were estimated using stochastic production frontiers. There were wide of variations of productivity among farms, where large farms exhibited the highest productivity. Gross return was the highest for small farms and net return was the highest for marginal farms. The lowest net return or the highest cost of production was accrued from both the highest wage rate and highest amount of labour used in <b>medium</b> <b>farms.</b> The marginal farms experienced the highest benefit-cost ratio (BCR) followed by small and <b>medium</b> <b>farms.</b> Average technical efficiency for large, medium, small, marginal and all farms were respectively 0. 88, 0. 92, 0. 94, 0. 75 and 0. 88. There were significant technical inefficiency effects in the production of rice for marginal farms only. In this case, production cannot be increased by increasing efficiency with the existing technology except in marginal farms. The application of efficient management system would be able to increase production in the marginal farms. For other farms, increased managerial capacity is not enough for increased production, rather new investment and advanced technology are needed to increase production in these farms. On an average, farmers could increase 12 percent output with existing inputs and production technology. Fertiliser, manure, irrigation cost, insecticide cost, area under production and experience were important factors to increase production. In the technical inefficiency effect, age, education and family size had positive impact on efficiency effect, whereas land under household had negative impact on efficiency effect...|$|R
