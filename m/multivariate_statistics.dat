25|$|Observational studies analyze {{uncontrolled}} data {{in search}} of correlations; <b>multivariate</b> <b>statistics</b> are typically used to interpret the more complex situation. Cross-sectional observational studies use data from a single point in time, whereas longitudinal studies are used to study trends across the life span. Longitudinal studies track the same people, and therefore detect more individual, rather than cultural, differences. However, they suffer from lack of controls and from confounding factors such as selective attrition (the bias introduced when {{a certain type of}} subject disproportionately leaves a study).|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} {{personality}} has {{a broad and}} varied history in psychology {{with an abundance of}} theoretical traditions. The major theories include dispositional (trait) perspective, psychodynamic, humanistic, biological, behaviorist, evolutionary, and social learning perspective. However, many researchers and psychologists do not explicitly identify themselves with a certain perspective and instead take an eclectic approach. Research in this area is empirically driven, such as dimensional models, based on <b>multivariate</b> <b>statistics,</b> such as factor analysis, or emphasizes theory development, such as that of the psychodynamic theory. There is also a substantial emphasis on the applied field of personality testing. In psychological education and training, the study of the nature of personality and its psychological development is usually reviewed as a prerequisite to courses in abnormal psychology or clinical psychology.|$|E
40|$|Two new {{concepts}} of order <b>statistics</b> for <b>multivariate</b> samples are introduced. In {{one of the}} versions {{it turns out that}} not every multivariate order statistic is present in every sample. These order statistics have application in multivariate ranked set sampling and can be used to generate broad classes of multivariate densities in the sense of Jones. In this case the likelihood for the sample values and their corresponding ranks can be calculated based on the conditional density of a <b>multivariate</b> order <b>statistics</b> given its sample value, and such that its integral gives the probability for the <b>multivariate</b> order <b>statistics</b> under discussion to be observed. An alternative version of <b>multivariate</b> order <b>statistics</b> is also introduced, for which <b>multivariate</b> order <b>statistics</b> are always well defined and expressions for their marginal densities are derived. Since these <b>multivariate</b> order <b>statistics</b> are tailor made for multivariate ranked set sampling, their densities allow for parameter inference based on ranked set sampling. Some simulations show that both <b>multivariate</b> order <b>statistics</b> densities can be used with advantage with respect to simple random sampling. ...|$|R

2500|$|Kernel density {{estimation}} is a nonparametric {{technique for}} [...] density estimation i.e., estimation of probability density functions, {{which is one}} of the fundamental questions in statistics. It can be viewed as a generalisation of histogram density estimation with improved statistical properties. Apart from histograms, other types of density estimators include parametric, spline, wavelet and Fourier series. Kernel density estimators were first introduced in the scientific literature for univariate data in the 1950s and 1960s and subsequently have been widely adopted. It was soon recognised that analogous estimators for multivariate data would be an important addition to <b>multivariate</b> <b>statistics.</b> Based on research carried out in the 1990s and 2000s, multivariate kernel density estimation has reached a level of maturity comparable to its univariate counterparts.|$|E
2500|$|In {{several studies}} of the {{methodology}} used by RaymondD. Gastil and others to create Freedom in the World report, Kenneth A. Bollen found that [...] "no criticisms ... have demonstrated a systematic bias in all the ratings. Most of the evidence consists of anecdotal evidence of relatively few cases. Whether there is a systematic or sporadic slant in Gastil's ratings is an open question". Bollen studied the question of ideological bias using <b>multivariate</b> <b>statistics.</b> Using their factor-analytic model for human-rights measurements, Bollen and Paxton estimate that Gastil's method produces a bias of 0.38standarddeviations(s.d.) against Marxist–Leninist countries and a larger bias, 0.5s.d., favoring Christian countries. In contrast, another method by a critic of Freedom in the World produced a bias for Leftist countries during the 1980s of at least 0.8s.d., a bias that is [...] "consistent with the general finding that political scientists are more favorable to leftist politics than is the general population".|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of the false discovery rate (FDR) by Benjamini and Hochberg has spurred {{a great interest in}} developing methodologies to control the FDR in various settings. The majority of existing approaches, however, address the FDR control for the case where an appropriate univariate test statistic is available. Modern hypothesis testing and data integration applications, on the other hand, routinely involve <b>multivariate</b> test <b>statistics.</b> The goal, in such settings, is to combine the evidence for each hypothesis and achieve greater power, while controlling the number of false discoveries. This paper considers data-adaptive methods for constructing nested rejection regions based on <b>multivariate</b> test <b>statistics</b> (z-values). It is proved that the FDR can be controlled for appropriately constructed rejection regions, even when the regions depend on data and are hence random. This flexibility is then exploited to develop optimal multiple comparison procedures in higher dimensions, where the distribution of non-null z-values is unknown.

40|$|Sign {{tests are}} among the most {{successful}} procedures in <b>multivariate</b> nonparametric <b>statistics.</b> In this paper, we consider several testing problems in <b>multivariate</b> analysis, directional <b>statistics</b> and <b>multivariate</b> time series analysis, and we show that, under appropriate symmetry assumptions, the fixed-$p$ multivariate sign tests remain valid in the high-dimensional case. Remarkably, our asymptotic results are universal, in the sense that, unlike in most previous works in high-dimensional statistics, $p$ may go to infinity in an arbitrary way as $n$ does. We conduct simulations that (i) confirm our asymptotic results, (ii) reveal that, even for relatively large $p$, chi-square critical values are to be favoured over the (asymptotically equivalent) Gaussian ones and (iii) show that, for testing i. i. d. -ness against serial dependence in the high-dimensional case, Portmanteau sign tests outperform their competitors in terms of validity-robustness.
