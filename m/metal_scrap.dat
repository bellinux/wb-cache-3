The Bychkov family resided in a house bought by Alexander's {{paternal}} grandmother, near Belinsky, {{and two years later}} his younger brother Sergei was born. Irina forced her children to work hard on the family vegetable garden from a young age. The boys were also forced to work for money for their neighbours, as well as collecting <b>metal</b> <b>scrap,</b> and would be beaten if they returned home with no money. Bychkov and his brother also committed petty thefts, for which they were caught several times but pitied by their target every time.|$|E

25|$|Not {{all that}} remains is bone. There may be melted metal lumps from missed jewellery; casket furniture; dental fillings; and {{surgical}} implants, such as hip replacements. Breast implants {{do not have to}} be removed before cremation. Large items such as titanium hip replacements (which tarnish but do not melt) or casket hinges are usually removed before processing, as they may damage the processor. (If they are missed at first, they must ultimately be removed before processing is complete, as items such as titanium joint replacements are far too durable to be ground). Implants may be returned to the family, but are more commonly sold as ferrous/non-ferrous scrap metal. After the remains are processed, smaller bits of metal such as tooth fillings, and rings (commonly known as gleanings) are sieved out and may be later interred in common, consecrated ground in a remote area of the cemetery. They may also be sold as precious <b>metal</b> <b>scrap.</b>|$|E
25|$|One of {{the largest}} marine {{scrapyard}}s on the East Coast, the Witte Marine Scrapyard, known as the Staten Island boat graveyard, is located at 2453 Arthur Kill Road. Now officially known as the Donjon Iron and <b>Metal</b> <b>Scrap</b> Processing Facility, the scrapyard was opened in 1964 by J. Arnold Witte, Sr. The scrapyard {{is known for its}} large assortment of obsolete steam tugs, ferries, carfloats, and other craft. Witte acquired them faster than he could break them up; the end result is dozens of vessels slowly rotting in the muck of the Arthur Kill. A number of noteworthy vessels, including the New York City Fire Department fireboat Abram S. Hewitt, which was involved in the rescue of survivors of the 1904 General Slocum tragedy and was the last coal-burning fireboat in operation in the FDNY's fleet, can be found here. Scenes from the 2010 thriller Salt, starring Angelina Jolie, were filmed on location at the Witte Marine Scrapyard.|$|E

[...] One is on water consumption, treatment, and reuse while extracting and processing dimension stone, including dust mitigation, sludge management, and maximizing water recycling. [...] Another is on site maintenance and quarry closure, including minimizing dust, noise, vibration {{and keeping the}} operation clean and tidy, both of which help in restoring the surface upon quarry closure. [...] A third one is on solid waste management, including overburden, damaged stone unsaleable as product, sludge deposited from waste water, spent or spilled petroleum products, or <b>metal</b> <b>scrap.</b> [...] The fourth one is on efficiently transporting stone to be finished as products, then transporting the products to consumers by centralizing freight management, consolidating small loads, choosing appropriate trucks, balancing and securing the load, and packaging with sustainable materials.|$|E

40|$|The <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> {{industry}} {{is part of}} the broader recycling industry that involves the collection,separation and processing of materials for manufacture into raw materials or new products. The demand for <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> is a derived demand – based on the demand for steel because <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> is an input to steel production. Steel demand in turn is based on demand by construction,manufacturing and other industrial sectors. Hence prices for <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> are a function of prices for steel. <b>Scrap</b> <b>metal</b> is an international commodity market – Australia is essentially a price taker and prices are set in global markets based on demand and supply factors. Prices of <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> in Australia are essentially set by the world price. Estimates of the sensitivity of Australian (or even global) <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> prices to global economic conditions are difficult to find. Nonetheless, one implicit estimate for Australia is that a 1 per cent fall in demand for <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> results in a fall in domestic <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> prices of 0. 46 per cent. Nonetheless estimates of the price sensitivity of <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> to demand and global economic conditions can be highly volatile. Evidence suggests global <b>scrap</b> <b>metal</b> prices regularly halve and double over the period of 18 - 24 months. ...|$|R
