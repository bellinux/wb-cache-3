25|$|First {{published}} in 1989, Hyperion has {{the structure of}} a frame story, similar to Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and Giovanni Boccaccio's Decameron. The story weaves the interlocking tales of a diverse group of travelers sent on a pilgrimage to the Time Tombs on Hyperion. The travelers have been sent by the Church of the Final Atonement, alternately known as the Shrike Church, and the Hegemony (the government of the human star systems) to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>request</b> of the Shrike. As they progress in their journey, each of the pilgrims tells their tale.|$|E

25|$|Cartagena spent 20 {{years in}} the Army before {{retiring}} as a Sergeant First Class, in 1971. He continued to be an active figure around the 65th Infantry Headquarters in Puerto Rico long after his retirement. He also had family in El Paso, Texas. His family, upon learning of Modesto's actions, had taken {{it upon themselves to}} <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>request</b> to Congress, that he be awarded the Medal of Honor. They received support on this quest from the Republican Veterans Committee. His supporters argued that the segregation policy of the army, at the time, and the limited English capacity of his company members when filling out the forms for the application, resulted in the awarding of the nations' second highest decoration, the Distinguished Service Cross.|$|E

500|$|On 10 July, the Foreign Office of Pakistan {{said that}} the {{rehabilitation}} of internally displaced persons was an internal matter and reiterated that Pakistan had not requested international assistance. [...] "We have very clear instructions from the prime minister , Pakistan has neither made nor intends to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>request</b> for international assistance. It has been made very clear that all expenditure related to temporarily displaced Pakistanis will be met from our own resources", Pakistani Foreign Office spokesperson Tasnim Aslam said. However, {{it was reported that}} the United States allocated $31million for IDPs and an additional $9.3million for health, hygiene, water and sanitation for IDPs and livestock. It was also reported that the United Arab Emirates government allocated $20.5million in IDP humanitarian aid.|$|E

500|$|In June 1993, {{partly in}} {{response}} to pressure from the United States, the Security Council passed Resolution 836 which authorized NATO forces to provide close air support for UNPROFOR forces upon request. The procedure to request air support was quite difficult, as it involved the [...] "dual key" [...] of both UN and NATO approval. UN approval required contact with the United Nations headquarters in New York City, making effective coordination nearly impossible given the difference in time zones. The UN approval process was later somewhat streamlined when UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali delegated the authority to authorize air strikes to his special representative in Bosnia, Yasushi Akashi. [...] Even after this simplification, however, [...] "dual key" [...] remained a problem as all requests first had to be processed through the UN Air Operations Center in Kiseljak then pass up the entire [...] UNPROFOR chain of command to Akashi. After Akashi approved the request, he would <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>request</b> to NATO commanders who then had to pass orders back down their chain of command and coordinate with forces on the ground.|$|E
2500|$|Second, the Transnational Information and Consultation of Employees Regulations 1999 enable unified work councils in {{multinational}} enterprises, {{operating in}} the EU. This is most likely for US multinational enterprises. In [...] "community scale undertakings" [...] or corporate [...] "groups" [...] with over 1000 employees, and 150 employees in two or more member states, employees {{have a right to}} a transnational work council to consult on any [...] "probable trend of employment, investments, and substantial changes... introduction of new working methods or production processes... and collective redundancies." [...] A [...] "group" [...] of undertakings exists when one undertaking has a [...] "dominant influence" [...] over another, for instance through company share ownership or rights to appoint or remove directors. Other features of transnational work councils are similar to the Information and Consultation of Employees Regulations 2004. Management can initiate a work council, or 100 employees in at least two undertakings and member states can <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>request.</b> Then, a [...] "special negotiating body" [...] (elected worker representative and management) will try to seek an agreement on the terms. If agreement cannot be reached, a template set of [...] "subsidiary requirements" [...] will form the work council's constitution. The rules have been criticised for not going further, or being integrated with other consultation laws, although every member state in the EU is able to go beyond the minimum standards laid down.|$|E

25|$|Users {{generally}} do not communicate directly with a DNS resolver. Instead DNS resolution takes place transparently in applications such as web browsers, e-mail clients, and other Internet applications.
