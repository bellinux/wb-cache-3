40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{phenomenon}} of the uncertificated securities in the context of financial law. Proper and prudential legal regulation of the securities is considered to be key element of efficient financial markets of which the importance for the economics is systematically growing in past few decades. From the beginning, financial markets were dominated by certificated securities represented by legal fiction incorporating rights arising from the security into a certificate and considering this certificate as a <b>tangible</b> <b>movable</b> <b>asset.</b> In the consequence of the development of financial markets and securities trading uncertificated securities were developed to make transfers of the securities and asset management feasible. Uncertificated securities can be defined as substitutable physical securities incorporating private rights which are prerequisite for the exercise and transfer of those rights and which are replaced by a record entered in the central register of securities, mainly central securities depositories. The form of the uncertificated securities determines the necessity of their special legal regulation taking into account their legal nature and connected legal aspects of record keeping. The purpose of my thesis is to analyse relevant Czech legislation and highlight both [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The asset {{structure}} of companies should matter for financing decisions. Small and medium-sized companies in Croatia may use <b>tangible</b> <b>assets</b> as collateral, either providing more access to creditors or as a guarantee in case of bankruptcy. The aim {{of this paper is}} to investigate the relationship between <b>tangible</b> <b>assets</b> and the capital {{structure of}} Croatian small and medium-sized enterprises. Most previous studies have shown various relationships between <b>tangible</b> <b>assets</b> and leverage. This study has been conducted on a sample of 500 Croatian SMEs for the period between 2005 and 2010. The data used for the empirical analysis were taken from companies’ annual reports. The Pearson Correlation Coefficient is applied in order to examine the relationship between <b>tangible</b> <b>assets</b> and leverage measures. The results of this research indicate that <b>tangible</b> <b>assets</b> are differently correlated with short-term and long-term leverage. The relationship between <b>tangible</b> <b>assets</b> and short-term leverage is negative and statistically significant in all observed years. The relationship between <b>tangible</b> <b>assets</b> and long-term leverage is positive in all observed years and statistically significant. The results show that small and medium-sized companies use their collateral to attract long-term debt, which means that small and medium-sized companies use lower costs and the interest rate of long-term debt in relation to short-term debt. These findings correspond with the maturity matching principle, according to which long-term assets are financed with long-term financing and short-term assets are financed with short-term funds. These results suggest that <b>tangible</b> <b>assets</b> have a positive impact on the long-term debt of Croatian SMEs because <b>tangible</b> <b>assets</b> constitute a positive signal to the financial institutions, which can request the selling of these assets in case of bankruptcy. These findings are consistent with the trade-off theory which predicts a positive relation between leverage and tangibility, but also with the pecking order theory, which is generally interpreted as predicting a negative relation between leverage and tangibility.

30|$|There is also {{an intense}} debate {{on the role of}} credit {{multiplier}} in establishing the external financing – cash flows relationship. The credit multiplier is considered as an additional instrument, which makes the relationship between cash flows and external funds less negative. Financially constrained firms suffer more from adverse selection costs than the financially unconstrained firms do. Therefore, creditors require more loan guarantees, mainly in terms of pledging <b>tangible</b> <b>assets,</b> in order to save their contracts while lending to financially constrained firms. Thus, financially constrained firms are likely to invest excess of their internal funds in <b>tangible</b> <b>assets</b> such as plant, property, and equipment. Possession of more <b>tangible</b> <b>assets</b> makes easy for financially constrained firms to acquire external funds. Several previous studies including Campello & Hackbarth (2012), Almeida & Campello (2007), Bernanke et al. (1996), and Kiyotaki & Moore (1997) have suggested that the tangibility of assets increases the capability of financially constrained firms to seek new funds. Almeida & Campello (2007) provided evidence that firms increase their <b>tangible</b> <b>assets</b> when they are in periods of positive income shocks which in turn increase firms’ capacity for new credit and as a result more <b>tangible</b> <b>assets</b> and so on. Almeida & Campello (2010) and Gracia & Mira (2014) demonstrated that financially constrained firms are more sensitive to increase the holdings of <b>tangible</b> <b>assets.</b> Therefore, the credit multiplier effect is expected to be more prominent in case of financially constrained firms than for unconstrained firms.|$|R

40|$|We {{characterize}} {{the relation between}} corporate asset structure and capital structure by exploiting variation in the salability of <b>tangible</b> <b>assets.</b> Theory suggests that tangibility increases borrowing capacity because it allows creditors to more easily repossess a firm's <b>assets.</b> <b>Tangible</b> <b>assets,</b> however, are often illiquid. We show that the redeployability of <b>tangible</b> <b>assets</b> is a main determinant of corporate leverage (beyond traditional measures of asset tangibility). Our analysis uses an instrumental variables approach that incorporates measures {{of supply and demand}} for various types of <b>tangible</b> <b>assets</b> (e. g., machines, land, and buildings). Consistent with a credit supply-side view of capital structure, we find that asset redeployability is a particularly important driver of leverage for firms that are likely to face credit frictions (small, unrated, and low payout firms). Additional tests show that asset redeployability facilitates borrowing the most during periods of tight credit. Our work contributes new evidence to capital structure models that are based on contract incompleteness and limited enforceability. It does so characterizing a well-defined channel through which credit frictions affect firm financial decisions...|$|R
