5|$|Abundant {{in eastern}} Australia, M. nigrocincta ants prefer {{temperate}} bushlands, {{and are usually}} located in dry to semi-dry forests and sclerophyll woodlands. The species {{is found in the}} eastern states of Australia, <b>mostly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> coastal plains where much suitable dry forest habitat can be found. They prefer tropical climates and warm temperatures. They can also be found in other types of habitat at elevations ranging from 80 - 1,220 metres (262ft - 4,000ft).|$|E
5|$|Balzac uses meticulous, {{abundant}} {{detail to}} describe the Maison Vauquer, its inhabitants, and the world around them; this technique gave rise to his title {{as the father of}} the realist novel. The details focus <b>mostly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> penury of the residents of the Maison Vauquer. Much less intricate are the descriptions of wealthier homes; Madame de Beauséant's rooms are given scant attention, and the Nucingen family lives in a house sketched in the briefest detail.|$|E
5|$|No. 460 was {{the last}} of the E6s model to be built, {{out of a total of}} 80 locomotives. From their {{construction}} in 1914 until 1920, the E6s ran <b>mostly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> corridor between New York City and Washington, D.C. After being replaced by the K4s model, the E6s locomotives were relegated to charter services because of their high speed.|$|E

5|$|The 1885 herd book {{describes}} {{two distinct}} types of Highland cattle. One was the West Highland, or Kyloe, originating and living <b>mostly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Western Islands, which had harsher conditions. These cattle {{tended to be}} smaller, to have black coats and, due to their more rugged environment, to have long hair. These cattle were named due {{to the practice of}} relocating them. The kyles were narrow straits of water the cattle were driven across to get to market.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union lost around 27 {{million people}} during the war, {{including}} 8.7 million military and 19 million civilian deaths. The largest portion of military dead were 5.7 million ethnic Russians, followed by 1.3 million ethnic Ukrainians. A quarter {{of the people in}} the Soviet Union were wounded or killed. Germany sustained 5.3 million military losses, <b>mostly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Front and during the final battles in Germany.|$|E
5|$|The {{courthouse}} is elaborately windowed. Some windows, <b>mostly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{first floor}} are straight topped. On {{the second floor}} most of the windows are topped with limestone arches. The original, wood-framed windows were replaced in 1972. The building's two main entrances feature stone arches over recessed doors; eleven step stairways lead to both doors. New doors were installed in both entrances in 1971.|$|E

5|$|The {{house sparrow}} is {{strongly}} associated with human habitations, and can live in urban or rural settings. Though found in widely varied habitats and climates, it typically avoids extensive woodlands, grasslands, and deserts away from human development. It feeds <b>mostly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> seeds of grains and weeds, {{but it is an}} opportunistic eater and commonly eats insects and many other foods. Its predators include domestic cats, hawks, owls, and many other predatory birds and mammals.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{was responsible}} for significant flooding and storm surges that caused $100million (2003USD) in damage <b>mostly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> peninsula of Baja California, and resulted {{in the deaths of}} 12people. Marty affected many of the same areas that had been affected by Hurricane Ignacio a month earlier.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{election campaign}} began in late September 2007. The campaigns {{of the three}} front runners were based <b>mostly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> personal appeal of the candidates, with few concrete statements about political issues. Zmago Jelinčič led an aggressive campaign, focusing on denouncing the three front runners, the Government, the ethnic and religious minorities, the Roman Catholic Church, and demanding an aggressive policy towards neighbouring Croatia.|$|E

5|$|Although Del Piero was <b>mostly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> substitutes' bench at Euro 2008, {{he started}} in Italy's second group match against Romania as the squad's captain. In the first group match against the Dutch, he came on for the under-performing Antonio Di Natale and made an {{immediate}} impact, including several efforts on goal; however, he could not prevent Italy from losing 3–0. Italy qualified through the group stage in second-place behind the Netherlands, eliminating Romania and France. In the quarter-final against eventual champions Spain, Del Piero made a substitute appearance during extra-time, and with the game ending in a 0–0 draw, it was decided by a penalty shootout in which Spain won 4–2.|$|E
5|$|Balzac wrote Louis Lambert {{during the}} summer of 1832 while he was staying with friends at the Château de Saché, and {{published}} three editions with three different titles. The novel contains a minimal plot, focusing <b>mostly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> metaphysical ideas of its boy-genius protagonist and his only friend (eventually revealed to be Balzac himself). Although it is not a significant example of the realist style for which Balzac became famous, the novel provides insight into the author's own childhood. Specific details and events from the author's life – including punishment from teachers and social ostracism – suggest a fictionalized autobiography.|$|E

5|$|Gallimimus are {{featured}} in a stampede scene where {{one of them is}} devoured by the Tyrannosaurus. The Gallimimus was the first dinosaur to receive a digital version, being featured in two ILM tests, first as a herd of skeletons and then fully skinned while pursued by the T. rex. Its design was based on ostriches, and to emphasize the birdlike qualities, the animation focused <b>mostly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> herd rather than individual animals. As reference for the dinosaurs' run, the animators were filmed running at the ILM parking lot, with plastic pipes standing in as the tree that the Gallimimus jump over. The footage even inspired to incorporate an animal falling in its leap as one of the artists crashed making the jump. Horse squeals became the Gallimimus sounds.|$|E
5|$|Isopods {{belong to}} the larger group Peracarida, which are united by the {{presence}} of a special chamber under the thorax for brooding eggs. They have a cosmopolitan distribution and over 10,000 species of isopod, classified into 11 suborders, have been described worldwide. Around 4,500 species are found in marine environments, <b>mostly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sea floor. About 500 species are found in fresh water and another 5,000 species are the terrestrial woodlice, which form the suborder Oniscidea. In the deep sea, members of the suborder Asellota predominate, to the near exclusion of all other isopods, having undergone a large adaptive radiation in that environment. The largest isopod is in the genus Bathynomus and some large species are fished commercially for human food in Mexico, Japan and Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Pang {{published}} her memoir, Loving John, in 1983. It {{was later}} updated and renamed John Lennon: The Lost Weekend. The original 500-page Loving John book focused mainly on Pang's role on Lennon's albums and sessions. It was edited down to 300 pages, concentrating <b>mostly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sensational {{aspects of their}} relationship. It also included postcards that Lennon had written to Pang during his travels throughout {{the world in the}} late '70s. Pang claims that she and Lennon remained lovers until 1977, and stayed in contact until his death.|$|E

5|$|Several {{other mammals}} have been {{recorded}} from the late Cretaceous of Madagascar, <b>mostly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of isolated teeth. A possible second gondwanathere is represented by a tooth that is larger and lower-crowned than those of Lavanify, and a yet lower-crowned tooth may also be of a gondwanathere. A lower molar, UA8699, may be of a marsupial or a placental and a molar fragment is referable to Multituberculata. Finally, an as-yet-undescribed mammal is known from a fairly complete skeleton. None of these mammals {{is related to the}} living mammals of the island, many of which belong to unique groups (see List of mammals of Madagascar). The fauna also contains crocodyliforms, dinosaurs, and other animals.|$|E
5|$|Some 97% of {{the common}} thresher's diet is {{composed}} of bony fishes, mostly small schooling forage fish such as mackerel, bluefish, herring, needlefish, and lanternfish. Before striking, the sharks compact schools of prey by swimming around them and splashing the water with its tail, often in pairs or small groups. Threshers are also known to take large, solitary fishes such as lancetfish, as well as squid and other pelagic invertebrates. Off California, common threshers feed <b>mostly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), with Pacific hake (Merluccius productus), Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), Pacific mackerel (Scomber japonicus), market squid (Loligo opalescens), and pelagic red crab (Pleuroncodes planipes) also being important food items. The sharks concentrate on a few prey species during cold water years, but become less discriminating during less productive, warmer El Niño periods.|$|E
5|$|Still {{eligible}} for junior, Brulé made the Blue Jackets' roster for the 2006–07 season. A month into the campaign, he was assured by General Manager Doug MacLean {{that he would}} not be returned to the Giants as he had been the previous season. He was scratched several times under head coach Gerard Gallant, but after Gallant was replaced by Ken Hitchcock in late-November, he began receiving more playing time. Playing <b>mostly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fourth line in his rookie season, he averaged 10minutes of ice time per game. He went on to tally 19points (9goals and 10assists) over 78games in his first full NHL season.|$|E
