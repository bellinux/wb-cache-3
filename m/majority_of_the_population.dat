5|$|Although {{the rocks}} beneath the city {{contained}} a vast reservoir of fresh water, {{known as the}} Trarza Lake, it is running out, owing to the large growth of the city. Engineers have warned it could run out by 2054, since it is not rain-fed, and is therefore non-renewable. The problem is particularly bad in the sandy shanty towns where the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> lives. Many people already have to buy water, which is expensive compared with the average wage.|$|E

5|$|The boyars, {{members of}} the landed nobility, formed the most {{important}} social group in the principality. The vast <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> was formed by peasants who were called several names, such as vecini ("neighbors") or rumâni ("Romanians"), in medieval documents.

The Live Life Show, in which a family are watched twenty-four hours a day as they struggle to live on an isolated rural island, becomes a massive success, especially when a murderer is introduced into the set-up.|$|E
