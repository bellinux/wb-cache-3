5|$|Another {{hypothesis}} is that the Anahim hotspot is supplied by a miniplume.

5|$|Brachiopods, as with molluscs, have an {{epithelial}} <b>mantle</b> that secretes {{and lines}} the shell, and encloses the internal organs.

5000|$|Generally, <b>mantling</b> is blazoned <b>mantled</b> x, doubled lined y; {{the cloth}} has two sides, {{one of a}} heraldic colour (the five {{principal}} colours being red, blue, green, black, or purple—there are other very rare colours as well) and the other of a heraldic metal (white or yellow). (See tincture (heraldry) for more on these tinctures.) The <b>mantling</b> is usually in the main colours of the shield, or else in the livery colours that symbolize the entity bearing the arms, though there are exceptions, with occasional tinctures differing from these, or occasional examples in which {{the outside of the}} <b>mantling</b> is per pale of two colours.http://www.whitelionsociety.org.uk/WLS%20Armorial%20Ppt%20GIF/Slide%20158.gif or both the inside and outside are per pale,http://www.nemzetijelkepek.hu/onkormanyzat-ocsod_en.shtml and even rarer examples of other divisions, and there is a perhaps unique example in which the lining of the <b>mantling</b> is per pale of the two metals or of the entire <b>mantling</b> being of a single tincture.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{presence}} of <b>mantled</b> fruit on large-scale clonal {{production of oil}} palm had trully decreased the oil productivity. <b>Mantled</b> phenotype {{is likely to be}} that of an epigenetic change involving DNA methylation and the MADS-box transcription factor gene which encoded floral organ homeotic transformation. The objectives of this research were to quantify the degree of methylation which determined fruit abnormality through Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) and to study its correlation with the MADS-box EgAGL 6, EgAG 2, and EgAGA genes expressed on <b>mantled</b> fruit derived from oil palm clonal plants which have been quantified using Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qPCR). This research was arranged in two replications for each gene and cDNA. The expression of the target genes were compared to EF 1 -α 1 as the reference gene. Through the Least Significant Difference (LSD) Test at 95 % confidence level of qPCR result, EgAGL 6 expression was significantly lower in <b>mantled</b> fruit which decreased from 1. 88 fold in Abn m to 0. 46 fold in Abn. EgAG 2 expression was increased non-significantly from 0. 91 fold in Abn m to 1. 13 fold in Abn, while EgAGA expression was higher in <b>mantled</b> which increased significantly from 1. 48 fold in Abn m to 1. 71 fold  in Abn. Nuclease S 1 digestion and UPLC revealed the genome-wide increase in DNA methylation on <b>mantled</b> fruit (18. 33 - 19. 55 %) compared to its normal counterparts (5. 67 %). This increased in global DNA methylation was showed by the significant decreased in EgAGL 6 transcript level of <b>mantled</b> fruit.

5|$|The {{outside of}} the <b>mantle</b> may be any color, {{typically}} red, while the inside is white or sometimes yellow to distinguish it from a secular <b>mantle.</b> David Johnson suggested that the <b>mantle</b> of all bishops should be white inside, excepting only patriarchs who use ermine, to indicate that all bishops are equally bishops. Above the <b>mantle</b> is a mitre (of the Eastern style) between a processional cross and a crosier. The earliest examples of the arms of Orthodox hierarchs have the cross to the dexter of the mitre and the bishop's staff to sinister, but opposite examples exist. An abbot (archimandrite or hegumen) should display a veiled abbot's staff to distinguish it from the bishop's staff.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} {{about the origin}} of Bowie seamount: Geological studies indicate that the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain may have formed above a center of upwelling magma called a <b>mantle</b> plume.

5|$|Although {{some of the}} seamounts in the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain {{appear to}} follow the {{expected}} age progression for a <b>mantle</b> plume trail, others, such as Denson Seamount, are older than that hypothesis would suggest.

40|$|AbstractElaeis guineensis (oil palm) {{accounts}} for a large and increasing proportion of the world's cooking oil production. Cloning via somatic embryogenesis results in a somaclonal variant known as <b>mantled</b> which produce fruit with little to no oil yield.

We performed RNA-Seq on developing flower and fruit samples of normal and <b>mantled</b> oil palm to characterize their transcriptomes.

Many genes are differentially expressed, including several from pathways that may be the cause of the <b>mantled</b> phenotype if disrupted, such as genes involved in primary hormone responses, DNA replication and repair, chromatin remodeling and a gene involved in RNA mediated DNA methylation.

40|$|Synneusis, the {{drifting}} {{together and}} systematic attachment of crystals in a melt, {{is involved in}} three of the known origins for <b>mantled</b> feldspars: (1) overgrowth, (2) exsolution, and (3) filling of skeletal plagioclase.

5|$|Because Triton's surface {{indicates}} {{a long history}} of melting, models of its interior posit that Triton is differentiated, like Earth, into a solid core, a <b>mantle</b> and a crust.

There is enough rock in Triton's interior for radioactive decay to power convection in the <b>mantle</b> to this day.
