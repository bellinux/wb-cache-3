The <b>multimedia</b> <b>group</b> 'Dalsy' had come into being. Dalsy went on to make several remarkable tapes (mainly of original material): The Loft Tapes, Rock 'n' Roll Accountancy, Live at Ding Dongs, Bored Kids, Domestic Cosmos, People Are Strange Dalsy Are Stranger, Steve's and the seminal punk work, Pale Horse Have a Fit... Dalsy did paintings, sculptures and poetry, and wrote a book named [...] "Lunch". They were tinny and quirky, obsessive and manic, versatile and productive. They were also immensely unpopular... The members of Dalsy grew to hate their audience. They still do, and this hate {{is an integral part}} of their music. Dalsy split up towards the end of 1977... They launched into 1978 as Blok Musik, with their famous Blok Musik tape... In April, they played at the Leederville Town Hall Punk Fest, alongside Perth's punk rock contingent but, as usual, no one danced. After that they went home and metamorphosised into Logic. Within a day they changed their minds, and metamorphosised into the Triffids." ...|$|E
2500|$|Creative Wonders (also {{known as}} ABC/EA Home Software until 1 June 1995), a {{multimedia}} software joint venture of Electronic Arts Inc. and Disney unit Capital Cities/ABC <b>Multimedia</b> <b>Group,</b> {{was founded in}} Redwood City, California in December 1994 to develop software for the children's market {{in an attempt to}} [...] "dovetail... with Disney's overall corporate strategy", utilize the [...] "creative, marketing, and distribution muscle of its partners", and cultivate a strong brand identity that was synonymous with product quality. ABC contributed a [...] "video archive and production expertise", while EA brought its [...] "software development experience and retail distribution system." [...] Michael Pole, Creative Wonders' director of development and an executive producer, [...] "supervised the development of children's product lines based on such well-known properties" [...] as Madeline. In 1993, he saw an opportunity for a [...] "recognised, franchizable property which could be marketed to girls in the 7-12 year old age bracket" [...] to enter the edutainment space. [...] Creative Wonders' president Greg Bestick envisioned an educational brand that would [...] "excite the emotions, stimulate learning, and provide entertaining, yet valuable lessons." [...] Starting from the 1939 publication of Ludwig Bemelmans' eponymous book, the Madeline franchise and its protagonist still remained popular decades after its release. By 1995, Madeline had become a [...] "cultural icon", and a [...] "widely licensed character in dolls, games and videos" [...] and was [...] "internationally recognized" [...] alongside Sesame Street characters such as Elmo, and Schoolhouse Rock's Lucky Sampson. DIC Entertainment had bought the Madeline content rights from Bemelmans in 1993 and had since produced the successful Madeline TV series for Home Box Office and The Family Channel. Michael Pole approached DIC to acquire the electronic rights to the Madeline franchise and secured the license for a [...] "low, up-front fee (plus royalties)" [...] in exchange for an assurance that their premiere video game title would [...] "contain the highest quality design elements". Interactive Publishers Handbook asserts that Creative Wonders performed a [...] "'song & dance' negotiation" [...] in which they convinced DIC of the benefit of a licensing agreement despite a [...] "short term lower cash infusion"; this was a three-pronged argument of: having an association with multimedia software of award-winning caliber, branding the Madeline name into a new multimedia market, and receiving free collateral publicity for DIC's television show via Creative Wonders' marketing campaign for their premiere title. Blasko felt that the video game project achieved [...] "synergy" [...] by being an interactive media extension of the animated adaptation of Madeline; the games were in made in association with The Incredible World of DiC. Interactive Publishers Handbook said the low upfront fee was a necessity as contemporary licensing fees for branded media characters ranged from $100,000-$250,000, while production budgets for high-end children's edutainment titles ranged from $400,000-$700,000, and the six figure licensing fees would have made it difficult for Creative Wonders to stay profitable while maintaining high production values. It highlighted the deal as a prime example of a publisher and licenser partnering up to [...] "produce a top-notch title in a cost-effective manner" [...] and sharing back-end royalties once the products hit the shelves, suggesting that high licensing fees would have been unbeneficial to both parties. Louis Roitblat was vice president of marketing at Creative Wonders, who [...] "directed his team on product line strategies for many successful brands including...Madeline".|$|E
