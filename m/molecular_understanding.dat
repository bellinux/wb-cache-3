In the late 19th century, notable physicians working in European teaching hospitals first described the cortical and dermatological manifestations; these early researchers have been awarded with eponyms such as [...] "Bourneville's disease" [...] and [...] "Pringle's adenoma sebaceum".

Further organ involvement was discovered, along with a realisation that the condition was highly variable in its severity.

40|$|About 9 % of Americans have diabetes, yet {{the tales}} behind {{research}} in endocrinology (the study of hormones) are largely undiscussed. Diseases {{are rooted in}} a sort of temporal interest – little attention is paid to the illness until it affects us or a loved one. Many of the great advancements in diabetes research stem from a greater understanding of insulin, a small hormone produced in the pancreas that tells cells to take in sugar from the bloodstream, particularly after a starch-filled meal. Diabetic patients either do not produce enough insulin or their cells cannot respond appropriately to insulin. Research in the field of insulin signaling has, for the last two-hundred years, encapsulated laboratory bench work, epidemiological studies, and clinical trials.

One important development was chain-termination DNA sequencing in 1977 by Frederick Sanger. This technology allows scientists to read the nucleotide sequence of a DNA molecule. In 1983, Kary Banks Mullis developed the polymerase chain reaction, providing a quick way to isolate and amplify a specific section of DNA from a mixture.

50|$|However, it {{was still}} a mystery how and why cells {{triggered}} by hypoxia-ischaemia should die hours or days later, particularly {{when it became clear that}} glutamate levels were not particularly high during secondary energy failure. The next critical idea came with the discovery of programmed cell death, a novel form of cell suicide. Originally observed as a pathological appearance and named apoptosis ("falling off", as of leaves) in the 1970s, Horvitz, Raff and Evan provided a <b>molecular</b> <b>understanding</b> and showed that apoptosis could be triggered by cellular insults. The radical idea that hypoxia-ischaemia triggered a cell suicide programme which could explain the perplexing phenomenon of delayed cell death was soon supported by experimental and human data, and many researchers believe this helps explain why neural rescue works in the newborn. However the picture is complex: both apoptosis and necrosis are present in variable proportions; and there seems to be prolonged neurodegeneration after an insult. Research into this problem continues.|$|E

5000|$|Anaerobic {{microbial}} mineralization of recalcitrant {{organic pollutants}} {{is of great}} environmental significance and involves intriguing novel biochemical reactions. In particular, hydrocarbons and halogenated compounds have long been doubted to be degradable {{in the absence of}} oxygen, but the isolation of hitherto unknown anaerobic hydrocarbon-degrading and reductively dehalogenating bacteria during the last decades provided ultimate proof for these processes in nature. While such research involved mostly chlorinated compounds initially, recent studies have revealed reductive dehalogenation of bromine and iodine moieties in aromatic pesticides. [...] Other reactions, such as biologically induced abiotic reduction by soil minerals, has been shown to deactivate relatively persistent aniline-based herbicides far more rapidly than observed in aerobic environments. Many novel biochemical reactions were discovered enabling the respective metabolic pathways, but progress in the <b>molecular</b> <b>understanding</b> of these bacteria was rather slow, since genetic systems are not readily applicable for most of them. However, with the increasing application of genomics in the field of environmental microbiology, a new and promising perspective is now at hand to obtain molecular insights into these new metabolic properties. Several complete genome sequences were determined during the last few years from bacteria capable of anaerobic organic pollutant degradation. The ~4.7 Mb genome of the facultative denitrifying Aromatoleum aromaticum strain EbN1 was the first to be determined for an anaerobic hydrocarbon degrader (using toluene or ethylbenzene as substrates). The genome sequence revealed about two dozen gene clusters (including several paralogs) coding for a complex catabolic network for anaerobic and aerobic degradation of aromatic compounds. The genome sequence forms the basis for current detailed studies on regulation of pathways and enzyme structures. Further genomes of anaerobic hydrocarbon degrading bacteria were recently completed for the iron-reducing species Geobacter metallireducens (accession nr. NC_007517) and the perchlorate-reducing Dechloromonas aromatica (accession nr. NC_007298), but these are not yet evaluated in formal publications. Complete genomes were also determined for bacteria capable of anaerobic degradation of halogenated hydrocarbons by halorespiration: the ~1.4 Mb genomes of Dehalococcoides ethenogenes strain 195 and Dehalococcoides sp. strain CBDB1 and the ~5.7 Mb genome of Desulfitobacterium hafniense strain Y51. Characteristic for all these bacteria is the presence of multiple paralogous genes for reductive dehalogenases, implicating a wider dehalogenating spectrum of the organisms than previously known. Moreover, genome sequences provided unprecedented insights into the evolution of reductive dehalogenation and differing strategies for niche adaptation.|$|E
