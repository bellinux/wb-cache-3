25|$|I owe {{a lot to}} R. B. Woodward. He {{showed me}} that one could attack {{difficult}} problems without {{a clear idea of}} their outcome, but with confidence that intelligence and effort would solve them. He showed me the beauty of modern organic chemistry, and the relevance to the field of detailed careful reasoning. He showed me that one does not need to specialize. Woodward made great contributions to the strategy of synthesis, to the deduction of difficult structures, to the invention of new chemistry, and to theoretical aspects as well. He taught his students by example the satisfaction that comes from total immersion in our science. I treasure the <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> association with this remarkable chemist.|$|E

500|$|The Land of Green Plums (...) is a {{novel by}} Herta Müller, {{published}} in 1994 by Rowohlt Verlag. Perhaps Müller's best-known work, the story portrays four young people living in a totalitarian police state under the Soviet-imposed communist dictatorship in Romania, ending with their emigration to Germany. The narrator is an unidentified young woman belonging to the ethnic German minority. Müller said the novel was written [...] "in <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> Romanian friends who were killed under the Ceauşescu regime".|$|E

As he was stationed in Tokyo, Tatsuguchi was occasionally able to visit Taeko and Misako when his duties allowed.

Ralph tells the story retrospectively, looking back on his boyhood adventure: [...] "I was a boy when I went through the wonderful adventures herein set down. With the <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> boyish feelings strong upon me, I present my book specially to boys, in the earnest hope that they may derive valuable information, much pleasure, great profit, and unbounded amusement from its pages." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout his life, Rudolph {{suffered}} from a gambling problem and was labeled a [...] "compulsive gambler". [...] He would often spend his leisure time placing bets at race tracks and Las Vegas, Nevada and Puerto Rico casinos. At that time, NBA referees were allowed to gamble, but this practice has since been prohibited. [...] As he incurred gambling losses, Rudolph was once offered by a Las Vegas gambler to erase his outstanding debt by participating in point shaving. [...] However, he {{refused to accept the}} offer and said to his wife, [...] "It goes against all my principles. I love the game too much, respect it too much. I couldn't do it to you. I couldn't do it to the <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> father, and I couldn't do it to myself. If I have to go into bankruptcy, something I'd hate to do, I'd do it," [...] according to in a 1992 New York Times interview with Susan Rudolph. [...] Rudolph had cashed in his $60,000 pension fund to pay debts and he still owed an additional $100,000. [...] While he refused to seek professional help, Rudolph cut back on his gambling habit later in his life.|$|E
500|$|In 1886, when Marie {{was eleven}} years old, the Duke of Edinburgh was named {{commander-in-chief}} of the Mediterranean Fleet {{and the family}} took up residence at San Antonio Palace in Malta. Marie would remember her time in Malta as [...] "the happiest <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> existence". It was in Malta that Marie found her first love, Maurice Bourke, {{the captain of the}} Duke's ship, whom Marie called [...] "Captain Dear". Marie was prone to fits of jealousy when Bourke would pay more attention to one of her sisters than to her. The Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh were greatly loved in Malta and San Antonio Palace was frequently full of guests. Marie and Victoria Melita received white horses from their mother and went to the local hippodrome nearly daily, apart from Saturday. During their first year in Malta, a French governess oversaw the princesses' education, but, due to her failing health, she was replaced the following year by a much younger German woman. At San Antonio, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh always maintained a room ready for Prince George of Wales, the second son of the Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII, who [...] was in the Royal Navy. George called the three elder Edinburgh girls [...] "the three dearests", but favoured Marie the most.|$|E

2500|$|Bradstreet is {{also known}} for using her poetry {{as a means to}} {{question}} her own Puritan beliefs; her doubt concerning God’s mercy and her struggles to continue to place her faith in him are exemplified in such poems as “Verses upon the Burning of our House” and [...] “In <b>Memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> Dear Grandchild”. Her works demonstrate a conflict that many Puritans would not have felt comfortable discussing, let alone writing.|$|E

2500|$|In 1847, Queen Victoria {{granted the}} Lodge to Lord John Russell, then Prime Minister, who {{conducted}} much government business there and entertained Queen Victoria, foreign royalty, aristocrats, writers (Dickens, Thackeray, Longfellow, Tennyson) and other notable {{people of the}} time, including Garibaldi. Lord John was much taken with the Lodge– [...] "an asset that could hardly be equalled, certainly not surpassed in England". Earl Russell (as he had become) died there on 28 May 1878; Fanny, his second wife, in 1898. Their daughter Lady Agatha Russell left a memorial, still standing in the rose garden: [...] "Pembroke Lodge 1847–1902— In loving <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> Father and Mother, Lord and Lady Russell and of our supremely happy home at Pembroke Lodge".|$|E

Among the witnesses who testified on his behalf were Debra Tate and Mia Farrow. Describing Polanski immediately after Tate's death, Farrow testified, [...] "Of this I can be sure — of his frame of mind when we were there, of what we talked about, of his utter sense of loss, of despair and bewilderment and shock and love — a love that he had lost." [...] At the conclusion of the case, Polanski read a statement, saying in part, [...] "The <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> late wife Sharon Tate was at the forefront of my mind in bringing this action." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ryan began {{full-time}} pastoral {{duties in}} Tennessee in late 1863 or early 1864. Though he never formally joined the Confederate Army, he clearly was {{serving as a}} freelance chaplain by {{the last two years}} of the conflict, with possible appearances at the Battle of Lookout Mountain and the Battle of Missionary Ridge near Chattanooga (both in late November 1863), and well-authenticated service at the Battle of Franklin (November 1864) and the subsequent Battle of Nashville (December 1864). Some of his most moving poems—"In Memoriam" [...] and [...] "In <b>Memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> Brother"—came in response to his brother's death, who died while serving in uniform for the Confederacy in April 1863, probably from injuries suffered during fighting near Mt. Sterling, Kentucky.|$|E
2500|$|The 17 December 1918 {{premiere of}} the Second Symphony under Kajanus's baton was {{extraordinarily}} well received. Writing in Uusi Suometar, Katila, for example, proclaimed Madetoja's latest work to be [...] "The most remarkable achievement in our music since the monumental series of Sibelius", and certainly the Second Symphony remains Madetoja's most popular. (Upon his mother's death in 1934, Madetoja retroactively dedicated the Second Symphony to her.) At this time, Madetoja also composed a piece for solo piano in memory of his brother, originally titled Improvisation in <b>Memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> Brother Yrjö and published in Lumikukkia magazine in 1918. In 1919, Madetoja expanded the piece into a three-movement suite, The Garden of Death, Op. 41. The suite, which shares melodic motifs with the Second Symphony, does not mention Yjrö by name.|$|E
2500|$|Of Victoria's journals, 111 volumes survive {{that were}} {{transcribed}} (and expurgated) by her daughter Beatrice and are accessible online. In her lifetime Victoria published two books containing small selections of entries: Leaves from the Journal of our Life in the Highlands (1868) dedicated to her late husband, covering 1848 to 1861 and More Leaves from the Journal ... (1884) {{dealing with the}} years after Albert's death – 1862 to 1882. In the second volume Victoria was in doubly deep mourning – she dedicated this volume to [...] "my loyal Highlanders and especially to the <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> devoted personal attendant John Brown", who had died a few months earlier. After transcription her original manuscripts were destroyed on her instructions but a few drafts in her handwriting remain – the one of 22 September 1855 mentions Glassalt and an image is available online.|$|E
