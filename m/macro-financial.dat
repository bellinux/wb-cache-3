5000|$|These impediments {{not only}} affect <b>macro-financial</b> {{stability}} but {{also reduce the}} growth dividends from deepening. At the same time, unsustainable expansion of financial systems can pose risks for stability.

5000|$|Viktor Yanukovych and his {{government}} were removed from their post by parliament after the 2014 Ukrainian revolution in February 2014. The ouster of Yanukovych plunged Ukraine into the 2014 Crimean crisis and the 2014 pro-Russian conflict in Ukraine. In March 2014 the EU condemned the Annexation of Crimea by Russia and Russia's [...] "clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity by acts of aggression by the Russian armed forces". The EU also froze (and tried to recover) [...] "misappropriated Ukrainian state funds" [...] and froze assets and blocked entry into the EU of Russians and Ukrainians deemed responsible for the unrest in Ukraine. The political part of the Association Agreement was signed on 21 March 2014 by new Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk. Customs duties for Ukrainian exports to the EU were temporarily removed in April 2014. Financial help was also promised to Ukraine. Ukraine was granted a <b>macro-financial</b> aid bilateral loan of one billion Euro in May 2014. The European Union and Ukraine signed the economic part of the Ukraine-European Union Association Agreement on 27 June 2014. President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy described the signing as a [...] "great day for Europe". Signatory (then new) President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko called it [...] "Ukraine is underlining its sovereign choice in favour of membership of the EU", and also described it as Ukraine's [...] "first but most decisive step" [...] towards EU membership. Poroshenko also set 2020 as a target for an EU membership application. As the Voice of America reported on 27 June, [...] "Terms of the EU agreements require Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine not enter into similar free trade agreements with the Kremlin." [...] On 16 September 2014 the Verkhovna Rada approved the draft law on ratification of the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the European Union, which was signed the same day by President Petro Poroshenko. The 17th EU-Ukraine summit took place on April 27, 2015 in Kiev. During an Eastern Partnership summit in Riga in May 2015, EU agreed on a €1.8bn loan to Ukraine. On January 1, 2016, the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area between Ukraine and the EU entered into force. By April 2016, the Association Agreement had been ratified by Ukraine and all EU member states except the Netherlands, which held a referendum on approval of the treaty. Following {{the rejection of the}} agreement in the referendum, Prime Minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte said that ratification would be put on hold during negotiations with the other parties to the treaty to find a compromise.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the transmission}} of financial shocks to the macroeconomy. The role of <b>macro-financial</b> linkages is investigated from an empirical perspective for the euro area as a whole, for individual euro area member countries and for other EU and OECD countries. The following key economic questions are addressed: 1) Which financial shocks have the largest impact on output over the full sample on average? 2) Are financial developments leading real activity? 3) Is there heterogeneity or a common pattern in <b>macro-financial</b> linkages across the euro area and do these linkages vary over time? 4) Do cross-country spillovers matter? 5) Is {{the transmission of}} financial shocks different during episodes of high stress {{than it is in}} normal times, i. e. is there evidence of non-linearities? In summary, it is found that real asset prices are significant leading indicators of real activity whereas the latter leads loan developments. Furthermore, evidence is presented that <b>macro-financial</b> linkages are heterogeneous across countries 2 ̆ 013 despite persistent commonalities 2 ̆ 013 and time-varying. Moreover, they differ between euro area and other countries. Results also indicate that cross-country spillovers matter.

40|$|We {{highlight}} {{an important}} <b>macro-financial</b> linkage: Regulatory enforcement actions on banks significantly reduce local economic growth. Exploiting {{the fact that}} regulatory enforcement actions impose shocks on bank business activities {{beyond the control of}} bank executives, and controlling for loan demand conditions, we use difference-in-difference estimations to demonstrate that severe actions such as Formal agreements and Cease and desist orders imposed on single-market banks reduce personal income growth in rural U. S. counties by 0. 7 and 0. 4 percentage points, respectively. These effects are causally related to contractions in bank lending and liquidity creation. Our identification is sharpened by a series of tests based on placebo enforcement actions that have no ramifications for local economic growth, and propensity score matching and instrumental variable techniques that account for the non-random assignment of regulatory actions.

While the optimal lead horizon is three years, indicators generally perform well with lead times ranging from one to four years.

40|$|Loan {{underwriting}} standards and quantitative easing {{are examples of}} macro-risk management tools that affect the financial sector, which in turn affects real sector outputs. And therefore asset returns, real sector outputs, financial sector, and macro-risk management are interrelated. This paper shows that investors need to understand these relationships to enhance investment performance. Recently, a <b>macro-financial</b> model (Ho et al., 2012, 2013; Ho and Lee, 2015 a, 2015 b) suggests that financial regulations must be dynamic to ensure optimality of real sector outputs while maintaining safety and soundness of the financial system.

This seminar, opened by Governor Christian Noyer, brought together forty five representatives from central banks in developed and emerging countries and from international organisations (such as the Bank for International Settlements and the European Central Bank), as well as twenty speakers from central banks, international institutions and the private sector. The first two days of the seminar were devoted to conferences on: • risks and sources of <b>macro-financial</b> vulnerability, the latest developments on credit risk transfer markets and the presentation of the findings of the cross-sectoral survey on credit derivatives in France; • the technical, financial and legal aspects of securitisation and credit risk management; • the presentation of the French and European experiences with respect to the role of central banks in rating companies and their contribution to financial stability; • bad debts and their impact on financial stability (case of Japan); • Basel II, a prudential framework which better reflects credit risk, and the effect of ratings on market dynamics; • lastly, the <b>macro-financial</b> consequences of risk transfers from the perspective of financial interdependence. Over the next two days, participants attended two workshops on the subjects of “Basel II, credit risk provisioning and accounting standards” and “Credit risk management and its <b>macro-financial</b> consequences”.

40|$|Motivation. Shallow and undiversified {{financial}} {{systems in}} low-income countries (LICs) limit macroeconomic policy choices, hamper policy transmission and implementation, and impede opportunities for risk transfer. This {{is of particular}} concern given LICs ’ more pronounced vulnerability to external shocks (e. g., sharp swings in commodity prices and fluctuations in external financing). Where the policy space and instruments to mitigate the ensuing macroeconomic volatility are constrained, growth and welfare costs can be large. Consideration of the macroeconomic policy-financial deepening nexus in LICs is thus crucial for the efficacy of Fund policy advice provided in bilateral surveillance. Objective and coverage. This paper aims to widen the lens through which surveillance is conducted in LICs, to better account for the interplay between financial deepening and <b>macro-financial</b> stability as {{called for in the}} 2011 Triennial Surveillance Review.
