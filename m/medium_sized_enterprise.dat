40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a survey-based study, which involved 120 small and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> <b>enterprises</b> in the East Midlands region of the UK, and aims to explore small and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> <b>enterprises</b> environmental practices, environmental capabilities and awareness of the regional support for green growth. Environmental capabilities of small and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> <b>enterprises</b> are found to be bound to energy efficiency projects, with very few small and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> <b>enterprises</b> having a strategic outlook toward developing these capabilities. The majority of small and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> <b>enterprises</b> did not access governmental grants to improve energy efficiency, and those who did accessed governmental rather than NGO or private sources. Around a third of small and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> <b>enterprises</b> did not invest in any form of Environmental Management System or Environmental Management Accreditation over the last two years. Environmental capabilities, which are considered to have a direct positive impact on cost reduction, are found to be attracting the highest demand from small and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> <b>enterprises.</b> The study offers a typology of small and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> <b>enterprises</b> environmental capabilities providing a valuable conceptual development in understanding the links between various environmental capabilities and their significance for the strategic success of an enterprise...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis article {{introduces}} the authors’ {{approach to the}} study of business success factors for small and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> <b>enterprises.</b> The approach is based on the currently dominant practice of estimating the success of an enterprise as its ability to produce profit. The authors have analyzed the success criteria used by managers of Russian small and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> <b>enterprises</b> based on the survey carried out among the managers of 212 small and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> <b>enterprises</b> in the period of September – November, 2014, and described the correlation between the business success of small and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> <b>enterprises</b> and the level of their managers’ social responsibility. To estimate the social responsibility, the authors used the values of average salaries and the proportion between the salaries of average executives and those of their managers. Hence, a nonlinear relation has been established between the business success of a small and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> <b>enterprises</b> and the manager's social responsibility...|$|R

40|$|Globalization and {{the growing}} {{pressure}} on medium sized enterprises {{to take responsibility for}} their operations has resulted in an increasing number of medium sized companies becoming aware of Corporate Social Responsibility. The aim of this study is to gain a better understanding of how Corporate Social Responsibility is incorporated in <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> <b>enterprise</b> operations by focusing on how these companies describe, integrate and monitor Corporate Social Responsibility and how they allocate financial resources for it. In order to shed light on this issue, three case studies were conducted in the Bamberg-Forcheim Region of Germany. Documentation and interviews were used as data collection methods for this study. The conclusions drawn from the findings of this study include the following: the working methods of medium sized enterprises regarding Corporate Social Responsibility are new and therefore not yet established. Corporate Social Responsibility is not yet considered an important part of <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> <b>enterprise</b> operations. Neither are enterprises very eager to implement and monitor this concept because of the high investment of time and finances involved. Businesses prefer to concentrate on their employees (training, social activities, extra-work activities etc) rather than to integrate, monitor and allocate resources for Corporate Social Responsibility.
