In this work, {{we report on the}} characterization of two Cold Hibernated Elastic <b>Memory</b> (CHEM) <b>foams</b> before and after two novel low-temperature sterilization techniques (plasma and ozone). Foams have different transition temperatures (Ttrans), as determined by Tand peaks in DMA tests, that depend on their chemical composition: both foams possess excellent shape recovery ability (Recovery Rate up to 99 %) in conventional shape recovery tests. Plasma sterilization (Sterrad sterilization system) resulted in a slight increase of open porosity, but no effects on bulk chemical and thermo-mechanical properties were observed. Ozone sterilization had a stronger effect on foams morphology, both in terms of an evident rupture of pore walls and surface oxidation. These modifications affected both thermomechanical and shape recovery behavior. Furthermore, plasma sterilized foams cytocompatibility was investigated with L 929 fibroblast cell line in vitro, showing a good adhesion and proliferation, as confirmed by SEM observation and Alamar blue assay.

Micro-gravity does not affect the ability of the foams to recover their shape but it poses strong limits for the heating system design because of the difference in heat transfer on earth and in orbit. A full recovery of the foam samples was not achieved due to some limitations in the maximum allowable temperature on ISS for safety reasons: anyway a 70 % recovery was also measured at a temperature of 110 °C.

40|$|Abstract. Shape <b>memory</b> epoxy <b>foams</b> are a {{new class}} of {{materials}} for aerospace applications as light actuators, structural parts with reduced size during transport, and expandable/deployable structures. They were tested in an experiment onboard of the International Space Station in May 2011 (Shuttle Mission STS 134) and in April 2013, on board the BION-M 1 capsule through the Soyuz- 2 launch vehicle, with the aim to study the behavior in microgravity for future applications. The experiments were performed by an autonomous device which was in turn composed of control and heating system, battery pack and data acquisition system. Micro-gravity does not affect the ability of the foams to recover their shape but it poses limits for the heating system design because of the difference in heat transfer on earth and on orbit. This could be very significant for the behaviour of complex multi-functional structures in which shape <b>memory</b> epoxy <b>foams</b> are integrated. In this work, the main results of the experiments in microgravity are discussed and some results of tests on ground are shown in order to evaluate new possible developments in the field...|$|R
5000|$|The {{mattress}} {{combines a}} high-density foam base, a mid layer of high-resilience comfort <b>memory</b> <b>foam</b> and a [...] "next-generation" [...] <b>memory</b> <b>foam</b> top layer. The top layer moulds {{itself to the}} sleeper's body providing comfort,. the base foam layer provides support. The layered design ensures breathability.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Memory</b> <b>foam</b> is {{affected}} by temperature. In a cool bedroom, a <b>memory</b> <b>foam</b> mattress will feel firmer than it does in a warm bedroom. Memory softens and conforms to the sleeper in response to body temperature and body weight. Traditional <b>memory</b> <b>foam</b> molds to the body creating a depression the sleeper must roll out of when changing sleep positions. Mattress manufacturers have responded to this issue by using [...] "faster response" [...] memory foams. They spring back more quickly when the sleeper moves. Foam mattresses are also known to generally [...] "sleep warmer" [...] than innerspring mattresses. Mattress makers have addressed the issue with [...] "open-cell" [...] memory foams, pinhole cored <b>memory</b> <b>foam,</b> gel-infused memory foams, channel-cut foam cores, reticulated foam support layers and other technologies to improve air circulation through all-foam beds.|$|E
5000|$|Unfortunately, the heat-retaining {{properties}} {{can also}} be a downside when used in mattresses and pillows so in the second generation <b>memory</b> <b>foam,</b> companies began using open cell structure to better help with breathability. In 2006, the third generation of <b>memory</b> <b>foam</b> was introduced. Gel visco or gel <b>memory</b> <b>foam</b> consists of gel particles fused with visco foam to reduce trapped body heat, speed up spring back time and help the mattress feel softer. This technology was originally developed and patented by Peterson Chemical Technology, and gel mattresses became popular with the release of Serta’s iComfort line and Simmon's Beautyrest line in 2011. Gel-infused <b>memory</b> <b>foam</b> was next developed with what were described as [...] "beads" [...] containing the gel which, as a phase-change material, would achieve the desired temperature stabilization or cooling effect by changing from a solid to a liquid [...] "state" [...] within the capsule.

40|$|Shape memory polymer (SMP) {{materials}} {{have the ability}} to remain in a deformed state and then recover their initial/cast shape. This property has significant potential in many different fields, including aerospace and bio-medical, in which a shape change is desirable and actuation may not be required. SMP {{materials have}} been made into nano-reinforced composites and also foamed to improve desired properties for specific applications. SMP foams offer two clear advantages over non-foam SMP materials in applications for the biomedical and aerospace fields. The key advantages are lower density and significant compressibility. The significance of this is that components made out of SMP foam are lighter than traditional SMP materials, more compressible and exhibit minimal transverse change during deformation and shape recovery. This increases the performance and efficiency of devices using SMP foam material. The need for a set of design criteria, models, and limits for the use of shape <b>memory</b> polymer <b>foams</b> was proposed. The effect of temperature and strain on the mechanical behavior, compression, tensile, cyclic compression, constrained recovery and free strain recovery of the material was used to determine the operational limits of the material. Next, the damage mechanism and viscoelastic effects in compressive cycling were determined through further mechanical testing and with the incorporation of three dimensional structure mapping via micro-CT scanning. The influence of microstructure was determined by testing the basic thermomechanical, viscoelastic and shape recovery behavior of foams with relative densities of 20, 30 and 40 percent. A similar suite of tests was then performed on the base epoxy material to generate the material properties necessary to fit constitutive equations to enable computational modeling. This data was then combined with three dimensional microstructures generated from micro-CT scans to develop material models for shape <b>memory</b> <b>foams.</b> These models were then validated by comparing model results to the experimental results under similar conditions.

In order to study the effect of nano-fillers on SM properties of the epoxy foams, foam compressibility was measured at a temperature higher than the transition temperature of the SM epoxy foam (i. e. the glass transition temperature).

40|$|Commonly used {{thermoplastic}} biodegradable polymers {{are generally}} brittle and lack appreciable elasticity at physiological temperature and thereby fail {{to mimic the}} elastic nature of many human soft tissues such as blood vessels. Thus, {{there is a need}} for biomaterials which exhibit elasticity. Biodegradable elastomers are promising candidates whose elasticity more closely parallels that of soft tissues. In this research, we developed hybrid biodegradable elastomers comprised of organic and inorganic polymer components in a block copolymer system: poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) and poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), respectively. A block structure maintains the distinct properties of the PCL and PDMS components. These elastomers may be useful for the tissue engineering of soft tissues as well as for shape memory polymer (SMP) devices. Tri-block macromers of the form PCLn-block-PDMSm-block-PCLn were developed to permit systematic variations to key features including: PDMS block length, PCL block length, PDMS:PCL ratio, and crosslink density. The macromer was capped with acrylating groups (AcO) to permit their photochemical cure to form elastomers. Thus, a series of biodegradable elastomers were prepared by photocrosslinking a series of macromers in which the PCL blocks varied (n = 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40) and the PDMS block was maintained (m = 37). All elastomers displayed hydrophobic surface properties and high thermal stability. These elastomers demonstrated systematic tuning of mechanical properties as a function of PCL block length or crosslink density. Notable was strains at break as high as 814 % making them suitable for elastomeric bioapplications. Elastomers with a critical PCL block length (n = 30 or 40) exhibited shape memory properties. Shape memory polymers based on an organic-inorganic, photocurable silicon-containing polymer system is a first of its kind. This SMP demonstrated strain fixity of 100 % and strain recovery near 100 % after the third thermomechanical cycle. Transition from temporary to permanent shape was quite rapid (2 sec) and at temperatures near body temperature (60 degrees C). Lastly, porous analogues of the biodegradable elastomers were created using a novel porogen - salt leaching technique.

40|$|The {{concept of}} facial impact {{protection}} mask for cyclists is proposed {{in response to}} increased participation in cycling {{and the need for}} injury prevention. The research aims to develop an approach for design of facial impact protection gear {{to reduce the risk of}} severe injury. Impact test equipment and procedure, face surrogate and protection material performance criteria are developed. Three groups of protective materials – rigid crushable, semi rigid, and soft cushion foams are tested and assessed according to criteria. The criteria are linked to measures of the risk of facial and brain injuries: HIC (Head Injury Criterion), peak deceleration, Face-bone damage and energy absorption. The impact energy is simulated by a drop test using a 48 mm-radius-steel hemispherical impactor, with a weight of 4. 63 kg similar to that of headform J specified in AS/NZS standard. The drop-height is 1500 mm, and the linear deceleration force of the impactor is recorded and used to establish the performance of the materials. The HIC is used to predict the risk of brain injury, whereas the developed face surrogate is used to assess facial bone injury. A 5. 4 m/s facial impact to the unprotected-face of a cyclist can result in the risk of severe facial bone fracture and mild brain injury. The impact test results for rigid foam protection of 40 mm thickness shows no densification (bottom out) and absorbs the impact energy without damage to the Foam-bone of the face surrogate. At 20 mm thickness, rigid polyurethane foams performed best with Foam-bone damage ranging from 15. 1 % to 20. 5 %. Other materials with thicknesses of 20 to 28 mm showed Foam-bone damage between 21. 8 % and 35. 1 %.

However, current filling methods do not result in optimal healing. Therefore, we are developing an alternative filling method using shape <b>memory</b> polymer (SMP) <b>foams.</b> This dissertation addresses multiple post processing methods and characterization of these SMP foams. The goals for characterizations addressed include 1) microstructure, 2) radio-opacity, 3) biocompatibility, 4) mechanical reticulation, 5) flow visualization via magnetic resonance imaging and 6) permeability measurements. The microstructure of the SMP foams was imaged via micro-computed tomography imaging methods at high resolution, 4 ?m/voxel. At this resolution we were able to resolve membranes, struts and obtain 3 D models of the foam for computational fluid dynamic simulations. Histogram data of average pore cells sizes in multiple axes were also measured. It was shown that these materials are anisotropic and heterogeneous. Increased radio-opacity via loading methods resulted in x-ray based visualization of devices made of these materials during endovascular implantation. The addition of high-z element particulates for radio-opacity resulted in a stronger or composite version of the material. It was shown that these shape <b>memory</b> polymer <b>foams</b> were biocompatible when implanted in a porcine aneurysm model. The implants elicited healing, were completely isolated from the parent vessel and covered with a complete endothelial cell layer at ninety days. A non-destructive mechanical reticulation device was made to puncture the membranes of the foams and thereby increase flow permeation. The permeability, or pressure drop induced by the samples was measured. Permeability results showed that with the increased amount of mechanical reticulation resulted in increased permeability of these materials. Flow visualization within the samples was achieved via MRI at sub pore cell resolution.
