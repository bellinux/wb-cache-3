60|$|But {{he cursed}} {{himself for a}} fool and a coward, not to have gone away--abroad--long ere such a {{possible}} confrontation threatened him.

50|$|In this {{geographical}} context, Asunción {{offers a}} microclimate for other media, cold during the southern summer rainfall (November to March), although {{it should be}} noted that the rains usually extend to other stations <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>here</b> in the Sierra north near the jalcas, days of intense solar heat during the months of May, June, July, August and mid September.|$|R

6000|$|... "I hate waiting. I do not {{see what}} good it will do. Besides, I don't mean to say {{anything}} about that,--not to-day, at least. I don't indeed. As <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>here</b> and not seeing her, that is out of the question. Of course she would think that I had quarrelled with her, and that I meant to take everything to myself, now that I have the power." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{think there}} {{could hardly be}} a more {{appropriate}} time <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>here,</b> Mr. Hartington; one could have no better time for studying social problems than the present when conventionalities {{have gone to the}} winds and one sees people as they are; but this is hardly the place to talk. I am boarding with a family at No. 15 Avenue de Passy. Will you come and see me there?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yet a very {{important}} man," [...] put in Bulstrode, [...] "as being entitled to lead {{the lady of the}} house to the table, in virtue of his birthright.

"Aside {{from seeing}} you, {{which is my}} {{principal}} reason <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>here,</b> and satisfying myself that I can transport inanimate things from Mars to Earth, and therefore animate things if I so desire, I have no purpose.

60|$|He said it with dignity, {{exactly as}} he might have said they were dukes or lord chancellors; but Philip could not help pitying him, not so <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> descended from so mean a lot, as <b>for</b> <b>being</b> fool enough to {{acknowledge}} it on a gentleman's lawn at Brackenhurst. Why, with manners like his, {{if he had not}} given himself away, one might easily have taken him for a descendant of the Plantagenets.|$|R

60|$|I {{trust that}} you will pardon me <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>here.</b> I {{do not wish to}} force my {{thoughts}} upon you, but I feel forced myself. Little as I know of Captain Brown, I would fain do my part to correct the tone and the statements of the newspapers, and of my countrymen generally, respecting his character and actions. It costs us nothing to be just. We can at least express our sympathy with, and admiration of, him and his companions, and that is what I now propose to do.|$|R

6000|$|... "Not {{political}} information," [...] Mr. Draconmeyer declared, {{his eyes}} blinking behind his glasses. [...] "For that I certainly should {{not come to}} you.

60|$|It {{was cold}} enough {{at the summit}} to cool anything, {{imaginary}} or otherwise. Even devotion shivered, as, in duty bound, it admired the venerable temple and its yet more venerable tree.

The other member does not want a Dhampir with the Brimstone society, regardless {{of the fact that she}} is only half-vampire and has fewer weaknesses, as the Society is trying to rid the world of Vampires (and presumably people with Vampire blood in them). Eventually they agree to recruit Rayne, and leave a necklace with their symbol on it (as seen on the game cover).|$|R
