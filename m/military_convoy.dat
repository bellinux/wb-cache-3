5|$|The first attack {{after the}} {{operation}} against the mosque was on 12 July 2007; two suicide attacks killed six people in northwest Pakistan. Another 28 soldiers were killed when a suicide attacker struck a <b>military</b> <b>convoy</b> in northwest Pakistan near the Afghan border on 14 July. Several terrorist attacks were carried out throughout Pakistan in July.|$|E
5|$|On 26 September 2010, Norgrove {{and three}} Afghan colleagues were {{travelling}} in the Chawkay District (also known as Tsawkay and Sawkay) of eastern Kunar Province {{when they were}} kidnapped by local insurgents. They were ambushed whilst driving on the main highway from Jalalabad to Asadabad, in the Dewagal valley, in two unarmoured, unmarked Toyota Corollas. A US <b>military</b> <b>convoy</b> was ambushed two months earlier on the same stretch of road. Norgrove wore a burqa to disguise her foreign appearance.|$|E
5|$|The British seized her in {{an action}} on 25 September 1806, and the Royal Navy took Minerve into service as Alceste in March 1807; Alceste then {{continued}} to serve throughout the Napoleonic Wars. On 29 November 1811, Alceste led a British squadron that captured a French <b>military</b> <b>convoy</b> carrying more than 200 cannon to Trieste in the Balkans. After this loss, Napoleon changed {{the direction of his}} planned eastward expansion in 1812 from the Balkans to Russia. The British historian James Henderson has suggested that the two events were linked, and may have changed the course of the war.|$|E
50|$|With {{the road}} bridge also unsafe {{for use by}} <b>military</b> <b>convoys,</b> it was {{suggested}} that decking should be constructed on the bridge to provide for a 3.5 metre wide roadway. As a result, American <b>military</b> <b>convoys</b> were able to use the bridge to cross the Fitzroy River. Flagmen and guards were placed {{at each end of the}} bridge, and convoys were worked around train services where up to forty trains used the bridge per day. The decking was removed in 1945.|$|R

5|$|The action {{came over}} {{eight months after}} the British had {{achieved}} a decisive victory over the French at the Battle of Lissa and was the first squadron action since that engagement. The action of November 1811 {{was the result of the}} British interception of a French <b>military</b> <b>convoy</b> traveling from Corfu to Trieste with a consignment of cannon, and resulted in a British victory, only one French ship escaping capture by the British force. It has been suggested that this action was a factor in Napoleon's decision to change the direction of his planned eastwards expansion in 1812 from the Balkans to Russia.|$|E
5|$|Between December 1964 and February 1965 the royalists discerned four Egyptian {{attempts}} to drive {{directly into the}} Razih mountains. The intensity of these thrusts gradually diminished, and {{it was estimated that}} the Egyptians lost 1,000 men killed, wounded and taken prisoner. Meanwhile, the royalists were building up an offensive. The Egyptian line of communications went from San'a to Amran, then Khairath, where it branched off north-eastwards to Harf. From Harf it turned due south to Farah, and then South-eastwards to Humaidat, Mutamah and Hazm. From Hazm it led south-eastwards to Marib and Harib. A <b>military</b> <b>convoy</b> went over this route twice a month. Since the royalists had closed the direct route across the mountains from San'a to Marib, the Egyptians had no other way.|$|E
5|$|Civilians {{who took}} part in the {{evacuation}} suffered the consequences of the military action along Route 7. Most of the civilians who followed the <b>military</b> <b>convoy</b> were either relatives of soldiers or officers in the army, or were government civil servants. Of the estimated 400,000 civilians who initially took part in the march, only a handful actually reached their destinations in the Mekong region. In addition to the casualties inflicted upon them by North Vietnamese artillery, the civilians were also hit by air strikes from the Republic of Vietnam Air Force. As a result of those huge losses, Route 7 became known as the ‘convoy of tears’.|$|E

While his column was passing the Soviet airfields {{near the city of}} Brody, German air strikes hit the aircraft on the ground. Several hours later, they arrived in Ternopil, having been strafed twice by the planes. Three days after the invasion, the plans for the counter-offensive were implemented, but disorder engulfed the troops, and the counter-attack collapsed. Bagramyan took part in the great tank battles in western Ukraine and the defensive operation around Kiev, in which Kirponos was killed and the entire Front captured by the Germans. He was {{one of a handful of}} senior officers who escaped from the encircled Front.|$|E
5|$|In early 1594, the Serbs in Banat rose {{up against}} the Ottomans. The rebels had, in the {{character}} of a holy war, carried war flags with the icon of Saint Sava. The war banners were consecrated by Patriarch Jovan Kantul, and the uprising was aided by Serbian Orthodox metropolitans Rufim Njeguš of Cetinje and Visarion of Trebinje (s. 1590–1602). In response, Ottoman Grand Vizier Koca Sinan Pasha demanded that the green flag of the Prophet Muhammed be brought from Damascus to counter the Serb flag and ordered that the sarcophagus containing the relics of Saint Sava be removed from the Mileševa monastery and transferred to Belgrade via <b>military</b> <b>convoy.</b> Along the way, the Ottoman convoy killed all the people in its path as a warning to the rebels. The Ottomans publicly incinerated the relics of Saint Sava on a pyre atop the Vračar plateau on April 27, 1595, and had the ashes scattered.|$|E
5|$|On 30 June Muhammad Ali {{landed in}} Jaffa with 15,000 troops from Egypt and on 2 July he convened {{with his son}} Ibrahim Pasha at Ramla, which was {{captured}} along with Lydda by Egyptian commander Salim Pasha who led Ali's <b>military</b> <b>convoy.</b> In Ramla, the arrested Jerusalemite notables were assembled. Ali ordered the arrest of rebel leaders Qasim, his sons Yusuf and Muhammad, Abdullah Jarrar and Isa al-Barqawi. He dispatched army commander Salim Pasha to Ali then instructed his ally Bashir Shihab II of Mount Lebanon to back Egyptian forces in the Sidon Eyalet. Meanwhile, Sulayman Abd al-Hadi and Ibrahim Abu Ghosh requested the release of Jabr Abu Ghosh from prison. In return for the allegiance of the Abu Ghosh clan, Ali heeded their request, released Jabr and appointed him mutassalim of Jerusalem in place of Muhammad al-Qasim, who had defected to the rebels {{at the start of}} the revolt.|$|E

50|$|On March 27, land {{communication}} with the Yishuv was severed completely when the Nabi Daniel Convoy was ambushed on its return journey to Jerusalem. In the following months, Arab irregular forces continued small-scale attacks against the bloc, which the Haganah was able to effectively withstand. At times, the Haganah forces, commanded by Uzi Narkiss, ambushed Arab <b>military</b> <b>convoys</b> — and, according to Morris, also Arab civilian traffic and British <b>military</b> <b>convoys</b> —, on the road between Jerusalem and Hebron. The defenders of Gush Etzion and the central command in Jerusalem mulled evacuation, but, although they had very few arms, {{a decision was made}} to hold out due to their strategic location as the only Jewish-held position on Jerusalem's southern approach from Hebron.|$|R
