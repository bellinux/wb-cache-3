40|$|In a 22 -year-old {{experiment}} in Southwest Germany, {{the effects of}} different fertilization systems (organic and mineral fertilizers) on permanent grassland were investigated. The effects were investigated under cutting and mown pasture with two grazing periods per year. The experiment had 8 fertilizer treatments and 3 replications, the size of field plots were 25 m 2 in area. Dry matter (DM) yields and mineral contents in soil and forage (P, K) were measured. The botanical composition was investigated each second year. Maximum DM yields were obtained by mineral NPK fertilization and a treatment called ‘alternating fertilizer’, with yearly alternating use of farmyard manure, liquid manure and mineral NPK. The application of composted farmyard manure reduced DM yields. The additional application of stone-meal and <b>metallurgical</b> <b>lime</b> to slurry did not increase the effects of untreated slurry on yield. Fertilization with slurry increased the proportions of grasses, whereas farmyard manure increased forbs. The proportion of legumes was increased by PK and by fertilization with slurry with lime...|$|E
30|$|At present, it is {{accepted}} {{that the increase}} of GHG concentration in atmosphere is attributed to human activities. Greenhouse gas emissions are produced as the by-products of various non-energy-related industrial activities. Industrial processes can chemically transform raw materials, which often release waste gases such as CO 2. The processes include production of iron, steel, <b>metallurgical</b> coke, cement, <b>lime,</b> carbonate consuming processes (e.g., flux stone, flue gas desulfurization, and glass manufacturing), ammonia and urea, petrochemical, aluminum, soda ash, titanium dioxide, ferroalloy and glass. The production of some petrochemicals results in the release of small amounts of CO 2 emissions. Petrochemicals are chemicals isolated or derived from petroleum or natural gas. The chemical and petrochemical industry accounts for 30  % of global industrial energy use and 16  % of direct CO 2 emissions. More {{than half of the}} energy demand is for feedstock use, which cannot be reduced through energy efficiency measures [2, 3].|$|R
