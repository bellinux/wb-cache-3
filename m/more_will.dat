30|$|The studies {{generally}} show {{a preference}} for urban locations and that substantial salary increases {{would be required to}} attract workers to less urban locations. Some of the studies find that individuals who come from rural areas are generally <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> to return to work in such areas (e.g. Chomitz et al. 1998; Serneels et al. 2010). Serneels et al. 2007 and Kolstad 2011 also observe that individuals, who in an experiment were <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> to help the poor, were also <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> to work in rural areas.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} if patients allow medical students to perform less invasive procedures compared to more invasive procedures, {{and how this}} is related to patient demographics and previous experience with medical students. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in six areas of Birmingham, UK. All members {{of the general public}} over the age of 18 were eligible, excluding non-English speaking people and those with cognitive impairments. Respondents were asked to rank their willingness for medical students to perform history taking/examinations and clinical procedures of varying degrees of invasiveness. Results: We received a total of 293 responses. For both history taking/examinations and clinical procedures, people were <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> to allow medical students to perform less invasive procedures rather than more invasive procedures. White and older people were <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> to allow all history taking/examinations procedures; additionally, women were <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> to allow history taking. White, female, and older participants were <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> to allow blood pressure measurement; whilst older people and those with previous experience were <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> to allow venepuncture. No significant associations were found for intubation. Conclusions: The public is less willing for medical students to perform more invasive procedures.

25|$|Another large {{component}} of the remodelling process is the disconnection of branched vessels, which then migrate to distal areas in order to supply blood homogeneously. Branching morphogenesis {{has been found to}} follow the dielectric breakdown model, in that only the vessels with sufficient flow will enlarge, while others will close off. At locations inside the vessel where two tube split off from one, one arm of the split is likely to close, detach, and migrate towards the venous line, where it will re-attach. The result of the closure of a branch is that flow increases and becomes less turbulent in the main line, while blood also begins to flow towards areas which are lacking. Which branch will close depends on the flow rate, direction, and branching angle; in general, a branching angle of 75° or <b>more</b> <b>will</b> necessitate the closing of the smaller branch.|$|E
25|$|The {{root cause}} of FAP is {{understood}} to be a genetic mutation—a flaw in the body's tumour suppressor genes that prevent development of tumours. The flaw allows numerous cells of the intestinal wall to develop into potentially cancerous polyps when they would usually {{reach the end of}} their life; inevitably one or <b>more</b> <b>will</b> eventually progress and give rise to cancer (7% risk by age 21, rising to 87% by age 45 and 93% by age 50). The flawed genes do not trigger cancer, but rather, they reduce the body's ability to protect against the risk of aged cells becoming cancerous. Even with the flawed gene, it may still take time before a cell actually does develop that is cancerous as a result, and the gene may in some cases still partially operate to control tumours, therefore cancer from FAP takes many years to develop and is almost always an adult-onset disease.|$|E

25|$|The savage, like ourselves, {{feels the}} oppression of his {{impotence}} before the powers of Nature; but having in himself nothing that he respects more than Power, {{he is willing to}} prostrate himself before his gods, without inquiring whether they are worthy of his worship. Pathetic and very terrible is the long history of cruelty and torture, of degradation and human sacrifice, endured in the hope of placating the jealous gods: surely, the trembling believer thinks, when what is most precious has been freely given, their lust for blood must be appeased, and <b>more</b> <b>will</b> not be required. The religion of Moloch — as such creeds may be generically called — is in essence the cringing submission of the slave, who dare not, even in his heart, allow the thought that his master deserves no adulation. Since the independence of ideals is not yet acknowledged, Power may be freely worshipped, and receive an unlimited respect, despite its wanton infliction of pain.|$|E
25|$|In any semiconductor, {{the band}} gap means that only photons with {{that amount of}} energy, or <b>more,</b> <b>will</b> {{contribute}} to producing a current. In the case of silicon, the majority of visible light from red to violet has sufficient energy to make this happen. Unfortunately higher energy photons, those at the blue and violet end of the spectrum, have more than enough energy to cross the band gap; although some of this extra energy is transferred into the electrons, the majority of it is wasted as heat. Another issue is {{that in order to}} have a reasonable chance of capturing a photon, the n-type layer has to be fairly thick. This also increases the chance that a freshly ejected electron will meet up with a previously created hole in the material before reaching the p-n junction. These effects produce an upper limit on the efficiency of silicon solar cells, currently around 12 to 15% for common modules and up to 25% for the best laboratory cells (33.16% is the theoretical maximum efficiency for single band gap solar cells, see Shockley–Queisser limit.).|$|E

In December 2017, an international student tournament will be played. While Chinese bandy is still in its initial stages, it is expected that Harbin even <b>more</b> <b>will</b> become the driving force behind the domestic development, for example via opening the Federation of International Bandy office for development and promotion in Asia.|$|E

Starting in 2004, TARC purchased hybrids, and by 2008 started purchasing clean diesel buses for a cleaner, greener fleet. By late Winter 2013, TARC added 16 more clean diesels. Then, by mid-Summer 2013, 11 hybrids were added, bringing TARC's hybrid total to 32.
