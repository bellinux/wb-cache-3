40|$|<b>Mucins</b> in the gastric {{mucus layer}} carry {{a range of}} glycan structures, which vary between individuals, can have {{antimicrobial}} effect or act as ligands for Helicobacter pylori. <b>Mucins</b> from various individuals and disease states modulate H. pylori proliferation and adhesin gene expression differently. Here we investigate the relationship between adhesin mediated binding, aggregation, proliferation and adhesin gene expression using human gastric <b>mucins</b> and synthetic adhesin ligand conjugates. By combining measurements of optical density, bacterial metabolic activity and live/dead stains, we could distinguish bacterial aggregation from viability changes, enabling elucidation of mechanisms behind the anti-prolific effects that <b>mucins</b> can have. Binding of H. pylori to Leb-glycoconjugates inhibited the proliferation of the bacteria in a BabA dependent manner, similarly {{to the effect of}} <b>mucins</b> carrying Leb. Furthermore, deletion of arsS lead to a decrease in binding to Leb-glycoconjugates and Leb-decorated <b>mucins,</b> accompanied by decreased aggregation and absence of anti-prolific effect of <b>mucins</b> and Leb-glycoconjugates. Inhibition of proliferation caused by adhesin dependent binding to <b>mucins,</b> and the subsequent aggregation suggests a new role of <b>mucins</b> in the host defense against H. pylori. This aggregating trait of <b>mucins</b> may be useful to incorporate into the design of adhesin inhibitors and other disease intervention molecules...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS—Helicobacter pylori locate {{not only}} on the apical surface of surface mucous cells but also in the mucous gel layer {{covering}} the gastric mucosa. The present study was undertaken to observe the mucous gel layer itself and any H pylori in this layer at the electron microscopic level, and to determine whether H pylori proliferate in this layer.  METHODS—We examined resected human stomachs (five cases, fixed in Carnoy's solution, paraffin embedded) under the light microscope, and gastric biopsy specimens (10  cases, fixed in glutaraldehyde with or without osmium, epoxy embedded) under the electron microscope. We performed histochemical staining for gastric <b>mucins</b> and immunostaining for H pylori, gastric gland mucous type <b>mucins,</b> and intestinal <b>mucins.</b>  RESULTS—Under the electron microscope, surface mucous cell type <b>mucins</b> and gland mucous cell type <b>mucins</b> in the mucous gel layer covering gastric mucosa without intestinal metaplasia showed reticular and band like structures, respectively. H pylori were frequently found as small aggregates within the mucous gel layer of surface mucous cell type <b>mucins,</b> and H pylori within these aggregates were seen dividing. H pylori were frequently found in the mucous gel layer of the surface mucous cell type <b>mucins</b> along the border with the layer of gland mucous cell <b>mucins.</b> Occasionally, H pylori were trapped by frayed thin threads of the gland mucous cell type <b>mucins.</b>  CONCLUSIONS—The two types of gastric <b>mucins</b> in the mucous gel layer differ in ultrastructure. H pylori preferentially colonise and form microcolonies within the mucous gel layer of surface mucous cell type <b>mucins.</b> <b>Mucins</b> from gland mucous cells may disturb the movement of H pylori within the mucous gel layer.    Keywords: gastric mucin; Helicobacter pylori; immunohistochemistry; surface mucous gel laye...|$|R

In an epithelial cell line that expresses the membrane-anchored <b>mucins,</b> MUC 1 and MUC 16, the <b>mucins</b> were independently and stably knocked down using shRNA. Barrier functions tested included dye penetrance, bacterial adherence and invasion, transepithelial resistance, tight junction formation, and apical surface size. Knockdown of MUC 16 decreased all barrier functions tested, causing increased dye penetrance and bacterial invasion, decreased transepithelial resistance, surprisingly, disruption of tight junctions, and greater apical surface cell area. Knockdown of MUC 1 did not decrease barrier function, in fact, barrier to dye penetrance and bacterial invasion increased significantly.

The {{purpose of the present}} study was to evaluate the putative usefulness of <b>mucins</b> in understanding the progression of gastric cancer and gallstone formation in a better perspective. Methods Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded gastric biopsy specimens and surgically resected gallbladder tissue samples were sectioned. Alcian Blue (AB) staining was performed to identify sialomucins (staining blue at pH 2. 5) and sulfomucins (staining brown at pH 1. 0) and then Periodic acid-Schiff's (PAS) staining to visualize the neutral <b>mucins</b> (staining magenta). Results In normal gastric and gallbladder mucosae, we found that neutral <b>mucins</b> were predominant, whereas in intestinal metaplasia, gastric carcinoma and stone-containing gallbladder, a significant increase of acidic <b>mucins</b> was found.

Each group was divided into three subgroups according daily application of enemas containing saline, sucralfate at 1. 0 g/kg/day or 2. 0 g/kg/day. Colitis was diagnosed by histological analysis and neutral and acid <b>mucins</b> by Periodic Acid Schiff and Alcian Blue techniques, respectively. The contents of <b>mucins</b> were quantified by computer-assisted image analysis. Student's t paired and ANOVA test were used to compare the contents of both types of <b>mucins</b> among groups, and to verify the variance with time, establishing level of signification of 5 % for both (p< 0. 05). RESULTS: Enemas containing sucralfate improves the inflammation and increases the tissue contents of neutral and acid <b>mucins.</b> The content of neutral <b>mucins</b> does not change with the time or concentration of sucralfate used, while acid <b>mucins</b> increases with concentration and time of intervention.

This gives the basal part of the cell a basophilic staining because of nucleic acids within the nucleus and rough endoplasmic reticulum staining with hematoxylin. <b>Mucin</b> within the granules stains pale in routine histology sections, primarily because these carbohydrate-rich proteins are washed out {{in the preparation of}} microscopy samples.

40|$|Secreted and transmembrane <b>mucins</b> are {{important}} components of innate defence at the body's mucosal surfaces. The secreted <b>mucins</b> are large, polymeric glycoproteins, which are {{largely responsible for}} the gel-like properties of mucus secretions. The cell-tethered <b>mucins,</b> however, are monomeric but are typically composed of two subunits, a larger extracellular subunit which is heavily glycosylated while the smaller more sparsely glycosylated subunit has a short extracellular region, a single-pass transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail.

However, it is uncertain in which cells and how COX- 2 is induced initially in the tumor microenvironment. We found that a conditioned medium of the colon cancer cell line, LS 180, contained a factor to induce COX- 2 in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This factor was purified biochemically and revealed to be <b>mucins.</b> A small amount of <b>mucins</b> (≈ 100 ng of protein per ml) could elevate prostaglandin E 2 production by monocytes.

We also have examined immunohistochemically the localization of COX- 2 protein and <b>mucins</b> in human colorectal cancer tissues. It is noteworthy that COX- 2 -expressing macrophages were located around the region in which <b>mucins</b> were detectable, suggesting that COX- 2 also was induced by <b>mucins</b> in vivo.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{quantify}} {{the intensity of}} the expression of neutral and acids <b>mucins</b> in mucosa of the colon with and without fecal stream and to correlate this with the duration of fecal transit diversion. METHODS: Thirty male Wistar rats were subjected to fecal transit deviation in the left colon by a proximal colostomy and a distal mucous fistula. The animals were divided into three experimental groups, according to whether sacrificing would be performed six, 12 or 18 weeks after surgery. The expression of neutral and acid <b>mucins</b> was evaluated using the histochemical techniques of Periodic Acid Schiff and Alcian Blue, respectively. The tissue <b>mucins</b> expression was quantified by computer-assisted image analysis software (NIS-Elements) in the segments with and without fecal stream. Student's paired t test was used to compare the quantities of <b>mucins</b> in colon with or without fecal stream and variance between the experimental groups by ANOVA and Newman-Keuls post-test, establishing level of signification of 5 % (p< 0. 05). RESULTS: There were significant decreased quantities of acid and neutral <b>mucins</b> in the colon without transit, compared with the colon with fecal stream, independent of the duration of exclusion. There was increased expression of neutral <b>mucins</b> in the colon with fecal stream after 12 and 18 weeks of exclusion. There was no increase in the expression of acid <b>mucins</b> in the colon with transit as the duration of fecal transit exclusion progressed. There was increased production of acid <b>mucins</b> in the animals submitted to diversion of the fecal stream for 18 weeks, compared with those subjected to diversion for 6 and 12 weeks. In the colon without fecal stream, there was increased expression of neutral <b>mucins</b> after 12 and 18 weeks of exclusion. CONCLUSIONS: Deviation of the fecal stream decreased the expression of acid and neutral <b>mucins</b> in the segments without fecal transit, compared with segments with transit. Regardless of the reduced expression of acid and neutral <b>mucins</b> in the segments without fecal stream, their tissue expression increased with increasing duration of intestinal deviation...|$|R

40|$|The {{interaction}} of secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor with bronchial <b>mucins</b> and glycopeptides was studied {{by means of}} c. d. spectroscopy. The interaction with <b>mucins</b> was characterized {{by an increase in}} organized structure of alpha-helical type, as evidenced by the appearance in the difference spectra of two positive bands at 208 and 218 nm. This phenomenon was correlated with the amount of inhibitor present in the mixtures, suggesting that the change was inherent to the inhibitor. Surprisingly, when the inhibitor was mixed with acid glycopeptides, difference c. d. spectra showed a decrease in organized structure, characterized by a negative minimum at 196 nm. Glycopeptides treated with neuraminidase gave similar profiles of difference spectra in three different mixtures, indicating that the interaction was smaller. The interaction between the inhibitor and <b>mucins</b> was also studied for its ability to modify in vitro the proteolytic activity of human leucocyte elastase. <b>Mucins</b> alone were degraded by that proteinase into glycopeptides of Mr 400, 000 - 500, 000, whereas <b>mucins</b> mixed with inhibitor before adding elastase were proteolysed to a lesser extent.

25|$|The {{concentration}} of galectin-3 is elevated in {{the circulation of}} patients with some types of cancer including breast cancer. It has also been identified bound to glycans {{on the surface of}} breast cancer cells. In cancer patients whose cancer has metastasised, galectin-3 is higher still, suggesting that this galectin has a crucial role in metastasis. Galectin-3 also binds to MUC-1, a very large transmembrane <b>mucin,</b> which on cancer cells changes expression from long core 2 type O-glycosylation to shorter core 1 type O-glycosylation. Core 2 glycans terminate in galactose or sialic acid, whereas core 1 is branched and has potential for large carbohydrate extensions. High levels of MUC-1 are associated with poor prognosis and increased potential of metastasis. This cancer-associated MUC-1 is a natural ligand for galectin-3. In normal cells, MUC-1 has distinct polarisation and acts as a protective barrier around the cell, reducing cell-cell interactions. In breast cancer cells, it is hypothesised that galectin-3 has high affinity for cancer-associated MUC-1, causing depolarisation and breaking the cell's protective shield. This exposes small adhesion molecules {{on the surface of the}} cell, which interact with adhesion proteins on endothelial cell walls, such as E-selectin, promoting intravastion into the blood stream. Experiments shows that overexpression of MUC-1 alone is not enough to increase metastatic potential, and in fact it inhibits tumour cell entry into the blood stream. It requires the presence of upregulated galectin-3 in addition to MUC-1 to increase invasive and metastatic properties of the cancer. This is supported by other studies showing that inhibition of galectin-3 in human breast cancer cells lose their malignancy in vitro. This may provide a clue towards developing therapeutics for cancer, such as galactin-3 inhibitors.|$|E

In one recent study, the adhesive mucilages of three species (D.binata, D.capensis, and D.spatulata) were analyzed for nanofiber and nanoparticle content. [...] Using atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, researchers were able to observe networks of nanofibers and nanoparticles of various sizes within the mucilage residues. In addition, calcium, magnesium, and chlorine – key components of biological salts - were identified. These nanoparticles are theorized to increase the viscosity and stickiness of the mucilage, in turn increasing {{the effectiveness of the}} trap. More importantly for biomaterials research, however, is the fact that, when dried, the <b>mucin</b> provides a suitable substrate for the attachment of living cells.

Essentially, a coating of Drosera mucilage on a surgical implant, such as a replacement hip or an organ transplant, could drastically improve the rate of recovery and decrease the potential for rejection, because living tissue can effectively attach and grow on it. The authors also suggest a wide variety of applications for Drosera <b>mucin,</b> including wound treatment, regenerative medicine, or enhancing synthetic adhesives.
