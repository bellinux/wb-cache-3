40|$|The {{combination}} of radiotherapy treatments and breast reconstruction, using temporary tissue expanders, generates several concerns {{due to the}} presence of a <b>magnetic</b> <b>valve</b> inside the radiation field. The objective of this work is to evaluate a radiotherapy treatment planning for a patient using a tissue expander. Isodose curve maps, obtained using radiochromic films, were compared to the ones calculated with two different dose calculation algorithms of the Eclipse radiotherapy Treatment Planning System (TPS), considering {{the presence or absence of}} the heterogeneity. The TPS calculation considering the presence of the heterogeneity shows changes around 5 % in the isodose curves when they were compared with the calculation without heterogeneity correction. This calculation did not take in account the real density value of the heterogeneity. This limitation was quantified to be around 10 % in comparison with the TPS calculation and experimental measurements using the radiochromic film.

40|$|Background Tissue {{expansion}} {{for breast}} reconstruction after mastectomy {{is a safe}} and effective procedure. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan can be requested for patients with a breast expander to evaluate concurrent diseases. The electromagnetic field of the MR can interfere with biomedical devices, resulting in potential hazards, compromising the diagnosis, or creation of artifacts. Methods Four tissue expanders with an integrated <b>magnetic</b> <b>valve</b> were tested. The temperature increase was measured using an infrared camera in the MR scanner. The expanders were tested (half-full and full of saline solution) both free in air and immersed in a phantom. The ferromagnetic properties of the devices were assessed using the deflection angle method. To evidence artifacts due {{to the presence of}} the expander, MR images were acquired for expanders tested in air and in the phantom. A valve localization test was performed after MRI analysis. Results A slight increase in temperature was demonstrated, without any clinical significance. The deflection angle due to the magnetic field depends on the distance from the bore of the magnet. The angle is higher when the device is closer to the bore. The presence of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>valve</b> influences the MRI signal, creating artifacts on the acquired images, even far from the valve itself. The valve localization test allowed verification of correct valve functioning for all the expanders after the MRI analysis. Conclusions Under selected conditions, MRI scans can be feasible. Heating is not expected to be a major concern, whereas valve displacement could happen in certain clinical conditions. The presence of artifacts is almost unavoidable...|$|E

40|$|Conventional lag dampers use passive materials, such as elastomers, to dissi-pate {{energy and}} provide {{stiffness}}, but their damping and stiffness levels diminish markedly as amplitude of damper motion increases.

40|$|High {{pressure}} {{fuel injection}} {{in a direct}} injection diesel engine {{is one of the}} most effective methods to reduce PM emissions. Pilot injection is also used to reduce NOx emissions and engine noise. Little research has investigated the fuel spray behavior under high pressure injection and pilot injection, and cylinder to cylinder deviations in spray behavior and the correlations with deviations in HC emissions are not clear. This study attempted to determine the relationship between cylinder to cylinder deviations in spray configuration and deviations in THC emissions with high pressure and pilot injections. It was found that an increase in injection pressure causes decreases in hole to hole and nozzle to nozzle spray deviations (Fig. 1). Very high injection pressures cause unstable spray development due to leakage from the <b>magnetic</b> <b>valve.</b> Deviations in THC emissions have a minimum at 40 to 80 MPa injection pressures (Fig. 2).

40|$|The Salt Valve and Instrumentation Test {{was done}} to provide data on {{equipment}} performance in high temperature environments similar to that expected in the next large scale application of that technology. The experiment tested three different valves: (1) a valve with the standard valve body and standard high temperature self-packing material; (2) a valve with the standard valve body and stainless steel O-rings; and (3) a <b>magnetic</b> <b>valve</b> that uses a high temperature coil and no packing material. The first valve, which was used at Solar Two, performed sufficiently throughout the test with only a small leak from the split-body, not the packing material, on the 6 th day of testing on the long-term test. The second valve, with the stainless steel O-rings, developed a small leak on the last run of the third test at the bonnet (packing material), at which point it was noted to watch if it got worse and the test continued. By the 6 th day of the long-term test, the leak was significant (up to 3 cups per day) and the test was terminated. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>valve</b> failed when exposed to a relatively low temperature of 500 F. According to the manufacturer, it was expected to survive up to temperatures of 600 F. Two different pressure transducers were tested and compared, Taylor and Dynisco. The Taylor pressure transducer was used and proven successful at Solar Two. However, {{they are no longer}} made. Therefore the experiment tested a new pressure transducer from Dynisco and compared the results to that of the Taylor. The Dynisco pressure transducer performed inaccurately from the beginning. The pressure transducer was affected by an increase in temperature when the pressure remained the same. Dynisco agreed to recalibrate the pressure transducer and/or send us a new one if the piece was faulty. However, in the process of removing the piece from the system, due to the high temperatures used, the piece had gulled with the stainless-steel piping and broke. Flared fittings versus Swagelock fittings were tested in the experiment as well. Both fittings showed no signs of any leakage when exposed to the high temperatures and corrosive environment. The existing test set-up for the Nagle Long Shafted Pump was used in this experiment and additional test hours were obtained on the pump bearings. However, only 132 hours (5 1 / 2 days) of the 5000 hours (208 days) were performed due to a salt leak, which required removal of insulation.

40|$|The photoacoustic soot sensor (PASS) {{has been}} {{optimised}} and characterised {{in this work}} to enable online atmospheric black carbon (BC) monitoring. The mobility of the sensor suited for outdoor measurements was already achieved by a former setup. The major technical modifications {{include the use of}} a new diode laser with an emission wavelength of 680 nm and an output power of 250 mW and the redesign of the photoacoustic resonance cell and all optical components. Additionally, most of the electronic compounds have been exchanged, e. g. function generator, microphone preamplifier, lock-in amplifier. Due to these modifications, the increase in the sensitivity of the system led to a detection limit in the order of 100 ng per m" 3. The selectivity has been enhanced by the use of a <b>magnetic</b> <b>valve,</b> which enables the independent determination of particular and gaseous compounds of the sample. Cross-sensitivities to water vapor or nitrogen dioxide can be excluded by differential measurement. Any influence by other airborne atmospheric particles like scattering salt aerosols, desert dust or humic acid is negligable under atmospheric conditions as has been shown in laboratory experiments.

This MRFE damper consists of a flexible cylindrical snubber body, a flexible elastomeric center wall fitted with two MR flow valves, through which MR fluid enclosed in the snubber body can pass through and be activated by a magnetic field in the MR valve. During normal operation, the MRFE damper is exposed to temperature variations due to ambient temperatures and in-service self-heating.

40|$|The {{actuation}} {{behavior of}} soft silicone-based magnetorheological eleastomers (MRE) in magnetic fields of variable strength was investigated. An {{inhomogeneous magnetic field}} {{gives rise to a}} reversible actuation effect, which {{is the result of the}} competition between magnetic and elastic forces in the material. MRE are capable to perform more sophisticated deformations than known rigid actuator materials. In this connection, the actuation behavior of MRE ring-shaped bodies in a valve-type device for the control of an air flow is demonstrated. For this purpose, MRE rings with different hardness were prepared and used in the valve. Additionally, the actuation of anisotropic MRE was compared with that of isotropic samples. The inhomogeneity of the magnetic field at the MRE material which is required for the actuation could be strongly influenced by the shape of the magnetic yoke. In the study, the closing characteristics of the valve with different yoke shapes and MRE materials were evaluated by measuring the dependence of the air flow rate on the magnetic field strength. It is demonstrated that the air flow through the valve can be controlled by the current in the field-generating coil, which yields the base for a new type of <b>magnetic</b> <b>valves...</b>|$|R
