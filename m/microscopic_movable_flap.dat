40|$|New {{developments}} {{in the design of}} off-shore harbours, involving land reclamation and the use of large vessels (draughts larger than 10 meter) have made it necessary for breakwaters to be constructed in deeper water. In deep water, vertical caisson breakwaters have been found to provide better economical solutions than rubble mound breakwaters, because they use less material per cross-section. These vertical caisson breakwaters lead to a high level of wave reflection, a phenomenon that causes unfavourable disturbance and which creates a threat to safe navigation of vessels. Because ofthis high wave reflection factor the wave loads on a vertical breakwater are also become high. To reduce the high reflection of waves and the wave loads on the vertical breakwater the search for innovative breakwater designs, which dissipate the wave energy effectively, is necessary. New existing innovative breakwaters like perforated and slit-type caissons are effective in reducing wave reflection and wave loads, but only in a narrow range of wave frequencies. The main question of this study is whether it is possible to dissipate wave energy in a dynamical way by transferring the wave energy to a movable element, which is able to dissipate wave energy effectively {{in a wide range of}} wave frequencies? New innovative dynamic breakwaters with movable elements are presented in this report. The wave damping characteristics of the dynamic breakwater with a horizontally translating flap are analysed. A simple mass-spring-dashpot model has been derived and this can be used to describe the dynamic behaviour of the <b>movable</b> <b>flap.</b> The damping characteristics of a dynamic breakwater with <b>movable</b> <b>flap</b> depend entirely on the hydraulic boundaries (wave height, wave period and water depth) and the characteristics of the <b>movable</b> <b>flap</b> (mass, spring stiffness and damping). The hydraulic performance of the dynamic breakwater is described by the reflection of the waves in front of the <b>movable</b> <b>flap.</b> To study the hydraulic performance of the dynamic breakwater with <b>movable</b> <b>flap</b> the analytic solution is obtained and a computer model is used. The analytical solution is derived to describe the wave reflection for waves that are assumed to be long waves, so vertical accelerations are not simulated in the analytical solution. From the analytical solution it can be concluded that, in theory, the dynamic breakwater with <b>movable</b> <b>flap</b> can damp waves totally for one specific wave period if the characteristics of the flap are tuned to this wave period. The main conclusion drawn from this study is that a dynamic breakwater with a <b>movable</b> <b>flap</b> is able to reduce the wave heights in a wider range of frequencies than a static breakwater. For a dynamic breakwater with <b>movable</b> <b>flap</b> with characteristics that are tuned to certain target wave conditions it is possible to reduce the wave reflection by 50 % for a wide range of wave frequencies.

The {{focus of the}} paper is on the numerical approach to this problem to provide noise predictions to engineering accuracy in an efficient manner. In addition, issues related to grid generation are discussed. The methodology uses structured multiblock grids. The block surrounding the jet centerline has a Cartesian form and the surrounding grid blocks have a cylindrical polar form – at least for nearly axisymmetric jet nozzle geometries. Appropriate block interface conditions are used. In the case of military style jet nozzles the nozzles are not smooth in the azimuthal direction but have facets representative of the <b>movable</b> <b>flaps</b> in such variable area nozzles. These features must {{be included in the}} grid. To enable efficient calculations, in addition to parallel computation, a dual time-stepping approach is used.

This includes control surface seals that seal the edges and hinge lines of <b>movable</b> <b>flaps</b> and elevons on future reentry vehicles. In these applications, the seals must operate at temperatures above 2000 F in an oxidizing environment, limit hot gas leakage to protect underlying structures, endure high temperature scrubbing against rough surfaces, and remain flexible and resilient enough to stay in contact with sealing surfaces for multiple heating and loading cycles. For this study, three seal designs were compared against the baseline spring tube seal through a series of compression tests at room temperature and 2000 F and flow tests at room temperature. In addition, canted coil springs were tested as preloaders behind the seals at room temperature to assess their potential for improving resiliency. Addition of these preloader elements resulted in significant increases in resiliency compared to the seals by themselves and surpassed the performance of the baseline seal at room temperature. Flow tests demonstrated that the seal candidates with engineered cores had lower leakage rates than the baseline spring tube design. However, when the seals were placed on the preloader elements, the flow rates were higher as the seals were not compressed as much and therefore were not able to fill the groove as well.
