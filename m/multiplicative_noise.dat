40|$|A robust {{filtering}} {{problem is}} formulated and investigated {{for a class}} of nonlinear systems with correlated noises, packet losses, and <b>multiplicative</b> <b>noises.</b> The packet losses {{are assumed to be}} independent Bernoulli random variables. The <b>multiplicative</b> <b>noises</b> are described as random variables with bounded variance. Different from the traditional robust filter {{based on the assumption that}} the process noises are uncorrelated with the measurement noises, the objective of the addressed robust filtering problem is to design a recursive filter such that, for packet losses and <b>multiplicative</b> <b>noises,</b> the state prediction and filtering covariance matrices have the optimized upper bounds in the case that there are correlated process and measurement noises. Two examples are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed filter...|$|R

The Kalman smoothers which include Kalman fixed-interval smoother, Kalman fixedlag smoother, and Kalman fixed-point smoother are given by solving Riccati equations and Lyapunov equations based on the projection theorem and innovation analysis.

In that article they state: [...] "This work presents a new operator of non-Newtonian type which has shown to be more efficient in contour detection images with <b>multiplicative</b> <b>noise</b> than the traditional operators. ... In our view, the work proposed in (Grossman and Katz, 1972) stands as a foundation, for its clarity of purpose." ...|$|E
50|$|Homomorphic filter is {{sometimes}} used for image enhancement. It simultaneously normalizes the brightness across an image and increases contrast. Here homomorphic filtering {{is used to}} remove <b>multiplicative</b> <b>noise.</b> Illumination and reflectance are not separable, but their approximate locations in the frequency domain may be located. Since illumination and reflectance combine multiplicatively, the components are made additive by taking the logarithm of the image intensity, so that these multiplicative components of the image can be separated linearly in the frequency domain. Illumination variations {{can be thought of}} as a <b>multiplicative</b> <b>noise,</b> and can be reduced by filtering in the log domain.|$|E

50|$|An {{important}} {{example is}} the speckle noise commonly observed in radar imagery. Examples of <b>multiplicative</b> <b>noise</b> affecting digital photographs are proper shadows due to undulations {{on the surface of}} the imaged objects, shadows cast by complex objects like foliage and Venetian blinds, dark spots caused by dust in the lens or image sensor, and variations in the gain of individual elements of the image sensor array.|$|E
50|$|For {{almost any}} other form of noise, on the other hand, some sort of {{non-linear}} filter will be needed for maximum signal recovery. For <b>multiplicative</b> <b>noise</b> (that gets multiplied by the signal, instead of added to it), for example, it may suffice to convert the input to a logarithmic scale, apply a linear filter, and then convert the result to linear scale. In this example, the first and third steps are not linear.|$|E

A study {{of the interaction between}} <b>multiplicative</b> motor <b>noise</b> variance, plant dynamics, and predicted operator response behavior shows that, in general, an increase in motor noise variance produces a decrease in operator gain and a decrease in high-frequency remnant. An increase in <b>multiplicative</b> motor <b>noise</b> variance is also reflected by an increase in the effective motor time constant; {{in the absence of a}} cost penalty on commanded control, the motor time constant equals the motor noise variance...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{synchronization}} induced by periodic inputs applied to the finite N-unit coupled bistable Langevin model which is subjected to cross-correlated additive and <b>multiplicative</b> <b>noises.</b> Effects on the synchronization of the system size (N), the coupling strength and the cross-correlation between additive and <b>multiplicative</b> <b>noises</b> have been investigated {{with the use of}} the semi-analytical augmented moment method (AMM) which is the second-order moment approximation for local and global variables [H. Hasegawa, Phys. Rev. E 67 (2003) 041903]. A linear analysis of the stationary solution of AMM equations shows that the stability is improved (degraded) by positive (negative) couplings.

40|$|The {{variance}} and passivity constrained {{fuzzy control}} {{problem for the}} nonlinear ship steering systems with state <b>multiplicative</b> <b>noises</b> is investigated. The continuous-time Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model is used to represent the nonlinear ship steering systems with state <b>multiplicative</b> <b>noises.</b> In order to simultaneously achieve variance, passivity, and stability performances, some sufficient conditions are derived based on the Lyapunov theory. Employing the matrix transformation technique, these sufficient conditions can be {{expressed in terms of}} linear matrix inequalities. By solving the corresponding linear matrix inequality conditions, a parallel distributed compensation based fuzzy controller can be obtained to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop nonlinear ship steering systems subject to variance and passivity performance constraints. Finally, a numerical simulation example is provided to illustrate the usefulness and applicability of the proposed multiple performance constrained fuzzy control method...|$|R

30|$|<b>Multiplicative</b> <b>noise</b> often {{exists in}} many {{coherent}} imaging systems, such as ultrasonic imaging, {{optical coherence tomography}} (OCT), synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and so on [9 – 11]. Speckle is the most essential characteristic of noisy images that are corrupted by <b>multiplicative</b> <b>noise.</b> For example, a radar sends coherent waves, and then the reflected scattered waves are captured by the radar sensor. The scattered waves are correlative and interfere with one another, resulting in the obtained image, which is degraded by speckle noise. Owing to the coherent characteristics of <b>multiplicative</b> <b>noise,</b> despeckle is more difficult than additive noise removal. If the statistical properties of <b>multiplicative</b> <b>noise</b> are known, <b>multiplicative</b> <b>noise</b> can be removed effectively.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} limit {{behaviors}} of stationary {{measures of the}} Fokker-Planck equations associated with a system of ordinary differential equations perturbed by a class of multiplicative including additive white noises. As the noises are vanishing, various results on the invariance and concentration of the limit measures are obtained. In particular, we show that if the noise perturbed systems admit a uniform Lyapunov function, then the stationary measures form a relatively sequentially compact set whose weak$^*$-limits are invariant measures of the unperturbed system concentrated on its global attractor. In {{the case that the}} global attractor contains a strong local attractor, we further show that there exists a family of admissible <b>multiplicative</b> <b>noises</b> with respect to which all limit measures are actually concentrated on the local attractor; and on the contrary, {{in the presence of a}} strong local repeller in the global attractor, there exists a family of admissible <b>multiplicative</b> <b>noises</b> with respect to which no limit measure can be concentrated on the local repeller. Moreover, we show that if there is a strongly repelling equilibrium in the global attractor, then limit measures with respect to typical families of <b>multiplicative</b> <b>noises</b> are always concentrated away from the equilibrium. As applications of these results, an example of stochastic Hopf bifurcation is provided. Our study is closely related to the problem of noise stability of compact invariant sets and invariant measures of the unperturbed system. Comment: 35 pages, no figure...|$|R
